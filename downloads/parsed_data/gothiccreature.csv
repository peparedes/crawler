"event","So this is how my day/night went...
i went to work today at big als, there is this guy there that has a thing for me i have told him many times that i just want to be friends but he couldnt handle even that...so i had to stop responding to his texts and calls. so basically he was ignoring me at work so i was avoiding him. half way through the day he decided he wanted to talk to me...i told him know he grabbed my arm so hard that i had red marks on my arm for the rest of the day...i went home at 6pm i started getting messages from him, they were basically all suicidal messages...so i texted a couple of our mutal friends to get them to call make sure he was ok and not to mention me...my friend jen calls me tells me he is on his way to the hospital. 

i finally start to relax me and chad go for a ride...i drive by that guys house all his cars are in the driveway, i wonder iof maybe he got a ambulance or got another ride but start to think that maybe he was lying about taking pills for attention from me...i head home 

i get home go upstairs to mine and chads room...there is a naked girl in the bed. I ask her who the hell she is and why the hell she is in my bed...she says ""this is your bed...really?"" i say ""yes"" why are you naked and in my bed? she says ill get out where is chad? i say he is outside having a smoke to get out of my bed and then i walk down stairs to calm down.
She calls for Chad i send him upstairs apprently she is his old fuck buddie and she came over 5 mins before we got home went upstairs and got in our bed....she comes down stairs hammered not knowing who i am and why im here even tho apparntly she knew chad had a girlfriend. Im freaking out ready to kill her...she starts telling me we should kill chads friend karen cause it would be easy and we could do it together...she then tells me and karen that chad told her that we were making out...she starts blaming everyone for something telling us how she payed 100 dollars to get here and soon we get her to agree to leave and go home so we get in the car and drive her back to Toronto...im in the back she starts asking chad to come up to her place she need to show him something, he says no...then she asks him to come upstairs she has to give him something ...he says no we have a friend at home she is waiting for us...she says chantal can come up to...we drop her off she is pissed off slams the door then we drive home in shock."

"event","I got the job.... i like the job.... but thats pretty much all there is to tell, I know its been a month but nothing really has happened. Halloween was fun and great like every year....this year i got really drunk ended up basically crawling outtta my friends place and almost pucked all over the ass hole who was trying to pick up my friend...he did pick her up which is alittle weird. I think its just the way that he mentioned that she was hot and drunk and going to try to pick her up that weirded me out, but she wasnt so drunk that she didnt know what she was doing and she seemed to have no issues with it the next morning so what am i going to say.... i said nothing actually, the guy is kinda hot but something has alway weirded me out about him. The night after halloween i went to see Saw 3D with Jen and Chad it was ok, pretty much alot of gore and like most movies that keep going it wasnt as good as the first ones. 

My Boss is a total hottie but yet again there seems to be something off about him....maybe its just that he almost seems like a bit of a loser and not in the cute nerd way, just kinda stuck in a dead end job he seems to have no goals which is weird for someone who seems smart he went to college and all that shit why is he a manager of a store? Whatever its not my life he is nice enought to me i get my job done i get my pay and i go home...i cant wait till my 3 months are over and i can start getting discounts on shit....this job is going to save me a ton of money on my fish shit....i already want a larger tank and more fish....oh btw i am working at BIG&nbsp;ALS&nbsp;in oakville. 

Chad is doing well, he is a TA in mississauga this month next month he is working in oakville and will be done his schooling in 6 months, time seems to be going by so quickly i can barely stand it... i dont know what im going to say or do when the 6 months is over....i dont even know if chad is still thinking of asking me to marry him at the end of his schooling i know that if i say yes i want a longer engagement...im not ready to married yet....plus if i do it again i want to go all out i want to go dress shiopping i want to pick out flowers and all that shit that i didnt get to do before....well thats all i got for now.

thanks for reading

I am going to continue writting it....and feeling better about my decision today i decided to do other things for myself and my sanity...i got my hair done and i started cleaning the house that i have not had the inspiration to do in forever...i also bought myself a crossword and started designing what i want to do to our trailer...Im being creative again...im looking after myself and my home again....

I&nbsp;have changed it like 3 time already...i have other beginnings but its better as added them as memories later. 13 is when my story really begins i am hoping that by writing this i will gain a lil incite on myself, what i want, whats good for me, and what i should do from this point on.

Oh and my great BF is going to pick us up at the bar so we dont have to cab it home! YAY he rocks!

I considered not going but my dad doesnt call very oftan and we need the money with chad in school and not knowing when the roommates are moving out. when i woke up i wanted to shoot everyone, I felt like someone ran&nbsp;me over with a truck...twice,&nbsp;but once i washed my face and packed my lunch i was pretty much ready to start my day even with only 4hrs of sleep.

Derek (Mr to hot to be alive...aka tall dark and handsome) picked me up and we drove to my dads loaded the trucks and headed to applby and steels area where our job site is and, worked worked and worked some more till there wasnt much else i&nbsp;could&nbsp;do...it was a large ass tree and it was fucking heavy so part of my day was spent&nbsp;shoting &nbsp;the shit with Derek while he worked and i tired to work as much as i could.&nbsp;When the day finally ended at around 3:30 i was fucking dead to the world, covered from head to toe in sawdust dirt and a lil bit of baby squirl pee...I was so ready to finally go home shower, have a bath lissen to music and get ready for my cleaning jobs, and more working with dad if they need help when i am done. Hopefully tonight i can sleep and i can make $400 in two days of work....i think it was worth it!"

I have had many adventures lately and while on these adventures i have started reliazing some things about myself and what i want in the future....tho it hasnt helped with my feelings towards my X it has helped me realize that he is my first love and he will always hold a specail place in my heart...and that just because i still have feelings for him doesnt mean i am not in love with the guy i am with now. <br /><br />But lets get on with it<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Heather, Maddy, Pat, James and I have all started to get to know eachother better... or at least this summer has been filled with drinking nights, girls nights,&nbsp;random events/free concerts&nbsp;and days lounging by the pool making videos and laughing our asses off. Heather is the all time beauty of the group with her tiny figure her great blue&nbsp;eyes that make me&nbsp;jealous&nbsp;and her fantastic personallity she is fun to be around you never know what new exciting story she has to tell about boys drugs and all around good times. Lately she started seeing this new boy who at frist i&nbsp;thaght was&nbsp;jerking her around but ended up coming out on&nbsp;top....she seems so happy&nbsp;even with having to drive&nbsp;45 mins to see him.&nbsp;Maddy is pretty amazing she is the definition of a&nbsp;hot curvy body, , curly hair , and a personallity that makes you smile no matter what, she is caring and loving and down to earth.&nbsp;Getting heather and maddy together&nbsp;is always a good time, and i have been having a great time being aroung them. Maddy is seeing also seeing a new boy,&nbsp;she meet him on eharmony and he is a cutie i personally liked him better then heathers BF at first but lately i have started to wonder if he is as&nbsp;harmless as he seems...only time will tell and until then Maddy seems happy just to have someone to spend time with. Pat is seeing someone too but i have not meet her and he doesnt seem to be head over heels or anything so there is not much to say and James well as far as i know he is single and him and my brother kissed once and embassy....didnt expect to hear that on girls night but it sure made the night intresting and now i know my brother is a good kisser....weird would have never figured.<br /><br />Jen&nbsp;W, Jenn C, Jackie and I have all been hanging out well Jenn C not as much but she has been around enough to have her name mentioned in my LJ....the Jens are actually sisters oddly enought, 1/2 sisters and there are 11 siblings in total...i have maybe meet 4 at most...any way the jens are completely different JennC fun chick confident and tiny like a toothpick, blond pretty and &nbsp;kinda a bitch which i love but can be a bit much from time to time, Jen W on the other hand has no self confidence is a larger then her sister but super cute, weird wackie so much fun to be around and can become annoying because she has more energy then me, for someone who is single she has more sex then i do, she is always talking about someone new or one of her 3 fuckbuddies well 4 if you include my X timmeh, that actually how we bacame friends bonding over our Tim experiences. Jackie is jackie she has huge tits and is hyper like me but can relax and enjoy doing nothing, she has&nbsp;long dark blond hair&nbsp;and&nbsp;she is one of my favorite people. anyway the 3-4 of us have been spending out summer at the beach, having bonfires, and just watching hot guys and asking them for rides on there seadoos, all around good times! we have a hard time getting all 4 of us together unless its the bonfires i attend at the Jenns house, but either way great to be around.<br /><br />Tyler: hmmmmmm i really dont wanna to talk about him right now but i figure it better to get if off my chest....he is engaged, ya like wtf mate, he meet the girl of his dreams a month ago and now they are engaged! getting married Nov 2011 so they will known each other a year when they are married i have friends together for 10years who should be married and arnt and now i have the opposite end it all with people who apparently just know as soon as they meet that they are going to spend the rest of there lifes together....i have been with Chad for 2 years and dont know that yet....well i hope it works out for them. Ty is one of my best friends and i wish him the best and Jen ya another one seems like a great chick. Oh and now i know why there has been nothing between me and Ty, im not his type and we are too good of friends to make that mistake.<br /><br />Timmeh (tall dark&nbsp;and&nbsp;HOT!!)&nbsp;we are still great friends we write, text, email, and talk all the time....he is back again in Nov and i can not wait to see him again tho im pretty sure this time i will have to share more of my time with him with Jen W&nbsp;because me and her are friends which i am kinda not looking forward too but i will deal as long as we get some time alone to talk, i wont care too much....he is still single which makes me worry about him a lil he seems lonely out there i guess girls are slim pickings out in his small town.<br /><br />Chad and I are great, we went to bristol for a nascar race and had an amazing time getting there we made our roadtrip down there a real roadtrip and had a blast! there was a lil drama&nbsp; while we were there when his brother decided that he needed his face punched in from me (he kissed me) and i let him know that he was an idoit. i told chad he got mad and eventually calmed down and the last 5 days together were good, thankgod.<br /><br />these last couple weeks have been good i work for dad made some money and am thinking of going on vacation again this time without chad i need to get away without kids, gotham BS, Boyfriends and all that shit and i am thinking about visiting Tim even tho chad wont like it but i trust myself and i know that Tim has no intrest in me anymore like that and i have been dying to go out there for 12 years its time....i cant put it off for another 12 years....<br /><br /><br />welll thats it <br /><br />Eternally yours,<br /><br />Harley Quinn<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

I think I have found a Show to watch while the summer weeknight keep me bored. Last Sept I started watching gossip girl but seeing as i started at season 3 I have felt lost in certain episodes. Now that there is little to watch on tv i have started watching season 1 and its werd to see how lil some of the characters change...same haircuts, same style, and same problems...as addicted as i am to the show its weird to think that in the two seasons i missed&nbsp;most of the&nbsp;characters have not evolved. 

I guess thats all i got so far since i have only watched episode one of season 1...
I will keep you updated

I have been having fun....Life is great.

Chad is going to be in university soon and I am planning a two week girls only road trip to the east coast ...I am so excited to get away with friends and have the kind of experience that i have always wanted to have...this is my ideal trip and i am finally able to have it. Luckily the trip is while Chad is in school so i wont be missing much time with him and a couple months later we are heading to Bristol for a NASCAR race. This year is going to be packed with lots to do and seeing as next year will not have anything to do cause Chad will be in school i want to become closer to the girls i am going on the road trip with.

that's it for my lame life...its actually pretty exciting this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)

"event","Yesterday i spent the whole day on my own reading, relaxing, crying to sappy movies on TV and really enjoying my time alone...but the best part of my day was when i had a bath with a spider. I'm not exactly a fan of the creepy eight legged creature, but something about this little tan spider relaxed me, really it should have freaked me out more it wasn't colorful, it wasn't fuzzy but it made me feel like i had someone with me to listen to me...so i talked to it. I told it everything that had been going on in my life...the worrying, the doubt, my trip, my friends and my weird jealous reaction to someone i should not have any feelings for at all. After i was done it climb down the wall to the ledge of the tub and watched me....that was kinda creepy in its own way...and i wondered if maybe it was telling me its story and even tho neither of us understood each other we just needed someone to listen to us and not judge, just accept that sometimes life is complicated and you need someone to listen. I left the tub the spider climbed back up the wall.&nbsp; 

This morning she was in the corner of the bathroom ...i decided to look up say hello and name her Kathrine...

ya I'm weird, but i recommend to all that they also have a bath with there bathroom spider and just once in a while let everything out cause at the end just saying&nbsp; the emotions that have been haunting your heart and the worries that have been clouding your judgment&nbsp; all seem to come into perspective when you finally let them go into words to someone you don't know and who in the end doesn't care, there just willing to listen.

Sincerely, Shawn &lt;3"

She even told him that the only way he is getting her back is to breakup with me...so far he has not broken up with me but i know it has crossed his mind and it has left a dent in our relationship. He is hoping she will calm down and he will be able to talk to her...he tells me that its not me, she would be doing this with anyone he dated and has just not to this degree. If Nina had a good reason not to like me he would probably have broken up with me....that was before she was told who i was on facebook and that person told her to look at my pics...the worst part is that it has to be someone on my facebook cause i had all my setting set to friends and friends of friends ...the badish pics were set to friends only....so now i have set my facebook on stalker proff lol nobody can see it or even search for me....anything to help chad i have even considered taking down my facebook but the damage is done from that site....the worst part is that afterwards chad checked out her pics and they are basically mine with her in them...fucking bitch is just looking for anything to use against him....its too bad she needs him in court, but i doubt he has the balls to screw her...plus she would win then and really never give alyssa back<br /><br />i dont know what to do other then sit and wait....<br /><br />Shawn xoxo</span>"

Last night i went out and bought some videos the _buns,__abs,__legs,_OF STEEL BOXSET, and Carmen Electra lap dance and hiphop workout videos....I spent some of my time figuring out a workout  routine and the plan is that im going to add the yoga from the videos and then one of the carmea dances before i do the routine as a kind of warmup exercise after the warm up cause the actual routine is pretty intence.

today i had a bowl of honey nut cheerios for breakfast and a cup of tea
      i had 3 large pancakes for lunch and a glass of milk
      i had  3 KFC snackers for dinner and a can of Dr pepper

I personally like the high energy exercises i perfer to do them lissening to music tho i have not gotten down a routine yet...or bought a video so im still finding videos online learning the exercise then doing it...takes alot of time but i feel the burn.

So i woke up in pain...and usually i would decide to take the day off of working out but because i have written that i am planning on keeping this up and writing about it i decided to keep on it...i decided that dispite being in pain and stiff i would work out anyway... and i did...surprisingly enough most of the exercises helped after they were done even if i could only do half as many at a time i went back and did more of them later and now im not stiff i hardly hurt at all and i seem to have enought energy to run a marathon, its a GOOD THING CAUSE I HAVE TO DO A SHIT LOAD OF LAUNDRY SO THATS ALOT OF RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS. I also decide to keep on the music so im dancing around and moving around...

**This morning i woke up in pain i dont think that i warmed up long enought and definatly didnt do enought streches so today i made sure i did them properally not rushing tho them at all and made sure i was doing all the streches properally also really lissening to what they were saying to do not just watching...i recommend that everyone do this :)

**I spend over an hour working out but...i spent 10 mins warming up today and i watched the 3-4 min video then watched them again as i was doing the workout...i wanted to make sure i dont wake up worse tomorrow. re watching the videos probably means that i spend about 30-40 mins working out. :)



breakfast: 2 packs of instant oatmeal (1/3 milk) 
lunch: peanut butter and jam sandmiches with BUTTER ...ya there goes the workout lol
Dinner: pasta with chicken and red sauce (same as yeasterday different sauce)"

"event","I woke up this morning better then the morning before, but still with no motivation to do anything. So i got outta bed and pushed myself into action. I made my bed (not very well but its made) washed my face and brushed my hair and headed down stairs to start my day.

The first thing i did was feed my fish and frogs, turn on my laptop so i could lissen to music and went onto Youtube so that i could load a workout video while i was cleaning my kitchen. I did everything in the kitchen its completely clean from top to bottom...I cleaned the cupboards under the sink took out the garbage and recycling...and cleaned out the garbage room outside. There was alot to do today before 6pm when chad got home...the main floor is in desprate need of a mopping and the basement has not been touched since before christmas...and im sure the kittylitter need to be taken out too :S Luckly i found my motivation somewhere between cleaning the kitchen and cleaning under the sink :) 

After the main floor was completed i started my workout i had planed on a 30 min workout but found out that im in worst shape then i orginal thaught. i did between 15-20 mins of working out including squats, lowerAb workouts, love handles workout, pushups and some others that i found on the site Diet.com/videos...i did about 15 of each unless it was pushups which i only did 7 of cause im weak. my body felt weird i know that it was working cause i felt the burn.lol i also did all the workouts twice to make it to almost 20 mins. maybe tomorrow will be better :)

"event","GOAL: lose a MAX of 25 Lbs in 3 months....135.2 Lbs

Current Weight: 160.2 

Offical Start date: Jan 18 2010

My weight is not an issue, i do not think that i am fat, or that i need to lose any weight at all, but i am not as healthy as i could be. I have given myself this goal to help with my depression, this winter it has gotten bad again and since Tanning is not in the budget this year i am choosing  other ways to battle my depression.

Journaling is suppost to help, setting Goals that help make u feel good about yourself and are suppost to help, Exercise is suppost to help, Eating better, and multi-Vitimins...so these are the things that i am going to write about for the next couple months...along with other things. 

The Plan so far is this...Be more active...me and chad have just started taking a walk together after work...im going to time it and take the distance down. I  plan on getting a work out video and doing it everyday...a 30 min workout aprox. I Clean for 8 hours once a week for work and i will be cleaning once a week on my own place (aprox 2-3hours) will record time soon. I will record my weight once a week on the weekend. the rest of my journals will be what i did, what i ate, how im feeling if im taking messurements of myself...what i plan on doing or adding to my routine...I also plan on slowly taking off some of my routine once i have gotten to my goal weight to find out what i need to do to stay at that weight. Im lazy so i want to do as lil as possible to look good.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COMMENT, AND ADD ADVICE ON WHAT CAN HELP ME LOSE WEIGHT...please no drug advice, body flushes or miracle cures i prefer to do this on my own. 

P.S If i stop before 25 Lbs its because i am already at a healthy weight and i decided to stop because i was unconforatable with losing anymore...this is in no way me driving myself nuts over body image...i may add pics bi-weekly.

I was stupid when I left my mothers and decided to be nice and give my little sister my lappy(laptop) so she would not go completely insane, So now i have no music.... and no computer other then chads which basically means no computer, cause i hate his keyboard with a passion. I am happy to be home me and Chad had some long over due amazing sex and after he bagged me back into his life i said yes...i kinda didnt want to im kinda sick of the emotional roller coaster that is our lives, but whats one more shot...i think things are going to change for the both of us...I think we are both more willing to work on things then we were b4, now that we understand how much we are losing.

some of me wishes i was single again, but most of me doesn't wanna give Chad up.

So here i am sitting in my moms living room starting my packing and lissening to Metric...i almost forgot about this band until i heard them the other day and downloaded as much of there shit as possible and i have been lissening to them all day...and most of last night. I have had an okey time while i was down here, alot of drinking has been going on im pretty sure that i drank everynight of the week that i have been there and due to that my new years resolution became to quit smoking again...its working mostly until i start drinking again then it starts up again....fuck....what can you do...?

 I chilled with my friend adam once this week...the more i see him the more of a tool he seems to be, there might have been something very wrong with me in highschool seeing as he has not changed at all other then him not being mean to me now...All im going to stay about him is he mushroom slaped my snow angel...along with other things like my moms wall and a his friends face...i did get to beat the living shit outt him tho :D he got really drunk and it ended with me and this hot chick Jodie hitting him in the ass with his belt. Oh the pics....lol I would have to say that as much as Adam is a good time i probably enjoy his friends company more...Tim is cool shit we sit around all day lissening to records, talking, drinking beer and dancing around his friend Randys house... I have such a great time when im down here if i could find a job here i would probably say fuck the world and move back.

In Other News: Me and Chad are probably getting back together...he called me up while i was down here and wants me to come back early cause he misses me and i kinda miss him too, its amazing how much i have been thinking about him while i was here he has been on my mind constinatly."

Well usually i feel cheated cause i totally got screwed outta presents and social obligations...i wish i had gotten at least one christmas dinner, that would have been nice instead i got invited and then told i wasnt allowed to go cause a ten year old girl was going and her mom who doesnt know me doesnt want us to meet...

 Still this christmas was probably the best christmas ever...i got candy and a toronto maple leafs bear and from my friends i got a frog pin (loves it) and bath stuff...and i got to go to the worst movie in the world with a great friend. Chad and i got in a huge fight and we are both doing alot of thinking, i want to be with him i just want things to be simple... example of not simple : its boxing day and im hiding from a 10 year old while she unwraps her gifts, then he leaves but before he comes back i have to sit quitely in his room and hide for a couple more hours till she is alseep. then fuck me if i wake up before 10 am tomorrow and have to piss, cause im not allowed to leave the room. 

anyone wanna trade BFs ...or familys...keep your gifts i just want christmas dinner :)

I know its selfish to say but im sick of feeling 2nd or 3rd place in his life, i wanna feel special i wanna feel like someone would go to the ends of the earth for me and he doesn't do that. I came home sick from my mothers house and we barely noticed me, he barely even asked me if there was anything he could do for me seeing as i was so sick...but the worst part was again being told i was no longer invited to something i was told i was invited too...this time its to christmas... I get it he its his daughter and im not allowed to see her sp now on christmas eve and boxing day i am gone and well boxing day i have plans with my friend thats if she still wants to go to see a movie....i might just leave town again...i already have issues with this holiday and now i have no reason to stay here. my real christmas is happening this weekend with my friends the people who are always there for me...i have to work monday, i need a ride to cambridge, and  wednesday the 23 i need someone to work but its not a good time of year and its way too close to christmas...fuck well i think ill be ok, something always turns up.

The NeoCitron is the&nbsp; cough and cold shit and it seemed to work cause I drank one of those around 8pm, and thats when i started getting shit done...even if i only decided that so i could sleep in tomorrow too...i did get done quite a bit tho :) 
I put away Newts toys and cloths, started cleaning the rags, found my missing mop pole YAY...i was worried i lost it. cleaned up the dishes and filled the supplies for work, the only things i have to get done now is bike to the bank, get my curling iron off pat, clean the house and inside of the fridge, repack the car. i would have to change the fish tank water but i decided to put that off till i get back next week :)

So now im tidying up before i head to bed while watching the 5th element.

I cant even say that i was being crazy, but of course im sure that they talked about what a bitch i am cause thats what guys do...girls do it too but we usually feel bad in the middle of our guy bashing and start coming down on ourselves.&nbsp; Anyway it was the stupidest fight...i didnt go to the movie last night cause he wanted me to get up early so he could get to the shop right after we picked up Newt cause he has a 20 hr job to do and he needs to have it done by sunday night... anyway he was mad that i said i wanted to see the movie and wasted his money on tickets that i did not know he was buying ahead of time...we dont usually buy them ahead of time so i dont see how its my fault...plus i had just finished 10 hrs of cleaning i was wiped and when he asked me he said i told him a 10 oclock show, and i did not know we had to be up early .... grrr arggg stupid fight ....i wish i had wished it was stupid when i was so mad that i packed my shit and slept on the couch while he was at the movie... the next morning i had forgot about the fight, and continued not to remember until we were on our way to grab noah and he asked me if i was moving out....and jokingly i replyed &quot; you cant move outta a place you dont actually live you just take your shit home...he then said so why did you pack all your shit ? and... and then i blanked for a second and all at once the entire fight and being pissed played like a movie on fast forward in my mind and i relaized how stupid we were both being, but while i think its stupid he is pissed. When he dropped off Newt and I&nbsp; he was kinda in a bad mood... i dont know what to do...i dont even know if he wants to me leave now or not, he isnt talking to me so thank god i have Newt today to keep my mind off everything... im just wondering if i should bring her upstairs tell her to play on the bed while i unpack or weather i should just leave everything there cause we have been fighting so much it would not be a bad thing to bring alot of my shit home...i dont live here he has never asked me to move in...then again&nbsp; he has never asked me to leave unless he had his daughter, and actually the one time he had mentioned that he wanted the house to himself and i went to my dads he got pissed off that i didnt come home and i was there about an hour after that fight...&nbsp; <br /><br />He can be so confusing, and he drives me crazy in so many way and as much as i was totally ready to leave last night the idea of leaving today breaks my heart and scares me half to death.... what to do...

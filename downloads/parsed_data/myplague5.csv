"event","Yesterday was pretty interesting in regards to a coincidence. My stepmother met Mrs. Talbot, the mother of an old friend of mine, who as always, insisted I call and hang out with her son Charlie. Later in the day, Mr. Bliss, the Vice Principal, was talking to me and mentioned I should hang out with him again. Although I was nice to both requests, personally I denied wanting to call him. Then my father caught wind of it later and told me off when I said that I had caught the hint that Charlie didn't want to be around me. He was blaming it all on me, and I snapped and started yelling at him. I told him that I knew it was my fault but I didn't care about not having friends anymore because I was used to people hating me for no fucking reason or something along that line. And he didn't seem to fight back or anything. I felt badly after. Also, later I found out another of Katie's lies.

Today I found myself breezing right through a couple mile run. My body is adapting fast and I'm glad - I'm not even on growth hormone or anything. But they said something like Charlie mentioned he had a dream I was tap-dancing or something stupid, and I figured that it was definitely a sign to call. So I did, and I left a message. I went to my mother's as usual and read a magazine to pass the time. Afterward - I saw Katie. Coincidence? I just waved and walked right by her, and then was all sociable with the girl at the counter of CVS. Kiss my ass Katie, you scum."

"event","Well, this morning I rose with a severe pain in my legs from running on Monday, a tearing feeling and a soreness that wouldn't go away. I managed to slowly and arduously walk down to the field, where a good collection of my teammates were waiting for me. As promised, we were going to run, and quite frankly, I had no idea how I'd be able to make it. But I did. We ran from the lower field several streets straight up a steep hill for a good half-mile, then another half-mile down the road to the entrance to Westville Dam/Recreation Area, then ran a mile down the road to Westville, through the dam, and then along the path by the woods and the river back to where we began. It was an amazingly tough run, but I made it, even though I was drenched in sweat, and had to break 30 seconds along the way. 

Then Josh and Victor took corner kicks as we all waited by the goal, and pathetically, noone really made that many good goals or they just mis-kicked the ball. I ended up making several headers and good goals, getting angry with everyone else's malperformance. I then jokingly suggested we played ass, and we did. For those of you who don't understand, ass is when you juggle the ball in a circle, and if you mess up, you get one letter of ass. Once you get ass, you must run to the goal, and bend over, while everyone else kicks soccer balls at your ass. If they hit, everyone goes again. If one person hits a part of their body, they can kick again themself. It keeps going until everyone misses. I nailed Mike straight in the ass as the last one to kick. ^^ And once again, I didn't have to bend over. Mike gave me a ride home seeing as we live almost right next to each other, and offered one Friday morning.

So I had run more, but I wasn't sore. I felt pretty good, and not as bad as I did Tuesday through Wednesday. But even stranger, I was tired, just like I am now. Really tired. But I can't sleep. There was something important I have to find out around midnight, long story.

I had managed to visit the library earlier too."

I wasted time doing things for myself that should've been spent preparing for tomorrow, or doing something constructive. Not sure if my legs can take the running tomorrow, but I'll die before I give in."

"event","My body's adapting to the workouts really well. I'm able to do them much faster than I was when I first implemented them, without having to stop to catch my breath or let my muscles un-tense and force out the lactic acid. I've increased push-up reps to 50 an hour. The only inhibitions I'm having are usually in my second set, during which my lungs start hurting during the side-to-sides, and my body sometimes just gives in after about 12-15 reps so I have to take a breath and start again. I'm at a solid 25 for each type of excercise though, bringing the daily total to:

Weight Lifting:
450 Reps.
Sit-Ups:
650
Push-Ups:
650
Side-to-Sides:
650
Leg-Ups:
650

"event","After I finished mowing that woman's lawn, my father took me out driving, which I'm pretty much all set with. I drove to my mother's house and visited briefly - my mother and I, I think, were both feigning pleasantness to avoid conflict. She rushed out the door to some real estate class, but put in a movie of their trip. I got to catch a brief glimpse of my dying great grandmother, and felt bad that I never got to see her except as a child. I left just as the rainstorm hit - it was a torrential downpour and lightning struck everywhere, including right accross the street from my house, leaving it without power. I stayed back as my father, stepmother and brother went visiting and worked out for a while, then lay in the dark when I couldn't see...

...they returned around 8:30, and the power shortly turned back on. For approximately one minute. I headed down to the computer, but, my stepmother told me she needed it. Well, power went off again, and when it came back at 9:30, she was on...

I spent the morning into the early afternoon doing heavy research on colleges. Then my father got on the computer. I read, and worked out obsessively until about 9:15. Then at about 9:30, he got off, but once again, I was too late.

It's tough living in two worlds at once, and I feel bad for Sara now that the summer and fall are pulling me deeper into reality. I mean, I know it's bad that we don't live all that close and don't see each other much, but if I can't even give her an IM or a phone call, she must feel even worse."

I didn't really want to come online, but I feel guilty for not being there for my friends, and I came to check on them. Most of them are gone, and I'm just making sure the ones that are, are okay.

I picked up a French Vanilla Coffee Coolatta. Say that ten times fast. I got home around 5, when I ate and then helped Dario with his baseball for a while. My father came too and we tested each other for a while...I slammed a few deep into the outfield, and afterward he once again talked to me about my ""natural swing"" and my talents in baseball. Problem is, I haven't played baseball for a team in a while, as much as I absolutely love it. But, he told me his friend who was an outfielder for the Sox didn't even start playing ball until he was out of High School...so maybe there's hope. 

I wasn't able to go online until now due to a computer-illiterate person using it, so I missed out on talking to Kacie, although I said I'd talk to her, and I missed out on Sara, and organizing tomorrow with her. I'll call her tomorrow morning. I also missed out on Jen and all my friends...online.

I didn't notice because my contacts weren't in and I was about to lay down until one jumped on my neck. It was 2 hours before I could clean it up and spray, then I watched TV for a while (doesn't happen much) and slept on the couch.

The library sent me a quaint little letter saying that they are considering the OTHER applicants for the job. How kind.

This is the second day in a row I've been landscaping from early morning to about 3, I'm pretty tired. Only yesterday I played soccer with Dario 2 hours after that. Today I searched for colleges and drew comics.

Speaking of Dario, he's screaming his lungs out like he has been for 5 minutes and Angela's crying. I'm going freaking crazy. And they wonder why I spend a lot of time in the basement.

Tomorrow I have to leave at noon for several hours to do stuff again, like pick up my grandparents from Logan in Boston.

On the bright side, Kacie and I are talking again. That's absolutely wonderful - how often do I even say that?

And Jen is happy to see me back. Which is great. And Sara and I will see each other soon.

"event","Well, I'm back from the Cape. It was a pretty interesting trip, and there's way too much to put in just one journal entry, so I'm just going to sum it up. It was great. But I really didn't enjoy it. Confusing? To put it frankly, seeing as I was alone for the trip except at night when everyone crammed in a room to sleep, I spent it all inside my head. And that's a dangerous place right there. I may have relived every painful memory, but as I result, I've found myself again along with the answers for a lot of the questions that were really plaguing me. I know what I see in my relationship, why I enjoy it, and why it fails, I understand why I continue to hurt people, and why I'm always so lonely. 

Our hotel was across from the beach, so, having nothing better to do, I spent most of my time physically on the beach. Swimming, lying there or walking. It was a pretty long week. The road bordering the beach was on a large plateau that overlooked the shore. I would go along the sands until I reached a large quarry of rocks, which I'd climb upwards for a while, until I found a ledge that placed me near a ruined rock wall that descended many, many feet down directly into the ocean. I'd walk along that narrow wall, or just sit there and watch the waves. I think it was a private property, but it's hard to reach that area and the only time I had ever seen anyone else on it was some guy and his girlfriend making out from on top of the hill. So it was a good place for me to hide. Although I would occaisionally wander into the city, or to the docks and piers. 

To be frank, I was lonely."

The past week is a blur and I'm only starting to take back control of my life. I had a great day with Sara on Monday. Tuesday I tried to visit my mother but she wasn't there, and ended up among people I used to know, where I was treated like some kind of hero returning home after a war. Yesterday I went back there, just to have a giant storm pour down on me on the way back. When I was back I was dripping, but shortly after, 4 old friends knocked on my door. I anticipated them to be somebody else looking for a fight, but it was a pleasant suprise to see Jackie, Magen, Tabatha, and Chris asking if I wanted to go bowling. We headed out to Lic's in Webster, went bowling and then headed to Friendly's. I had a huge coffee, didn't feel like eating. It was a great night, I got home about 10 when everyone was asleep. I'm supposed to be doing something important now, but I can't. Long story."

I didn't know anyone there except my godmother, and her son, who speaks mostly Spanish, and her daughter, who really doesn't get along well with me. There was another kid I used to be friends with when we were kids, but, even though he's like 16 he was smoking and drinking and trying to act like a bigshot. Yeah, smoking around your mother really is cool.  :roll: He gave me some extremely dirty looks, which I returned with the, ""look at me again and I'll kick the shit out of you"" look. I HATE people who are dissociable for no proper reason. He avoided me after that. Everyone who talked to me only did so to ask where my mother is, and I replied I didn't know. She arrived a couple hours late with my brother and her friend, and asked incredulously why I didn't show up to her house, to which I replied, I didn't know she was coming; she didn't say anything. She was being extremely mawkish and I wonder whether or not she was being nice, or just covering up some internal malice in front of her friends. I don't really care, either way. She only wanted me there to babysit. I left shortly after, I was bored to hell and I had no reason to be there really.

Yesterday was my little brother's birthday party, a month early so we could celebrate with his grandfather, who's visiting. Unfortunately I wasn't informed until the night before, so I couldn't get him anything.  :( I will on his real birthday though.

Fishing was intense yesterday, and even though I'm around 13th now, I really don't know if I can make it. I'll try my damn hardest, and this noob won't go down without a fight.

"event","Well, I was going to go to a concert with my father today, but, Angela came home and she wanted to go, so they are going together instead. So I'm stuck home without anything to do. Thursday was a fun day with Sara, and we'd be hanging out today if my father didn't tell me no, I had to stay home and help around the house. So I think I'll be either lifting weights or drawing for a while. I might be going to school Monday, to do some extra credit to bring my grade up to an A. 

I popped in an old blank CD earlier, and it played a lot of old songs, reminded me of the past. As much as I try to forget and put the past behind me, the pain will always be a part of me. I'm sorry to everybody I hurt, and for everything I've done wrong. I say it a lot, but it's in my blood to err. And my heart to try and atone. I lay down my life for those I've hurt. 

And I think this space bar is going to break soon. Ack. Jen is M.I.A...."

~Hell of a lot of walking.

<Journal Entry>

The day was uneventful at best. Mr. Laine over-pressurized a bottle, which exploded and went with about the force of a giant bullet into a glass cabinet, which shattered. He asked me to go to his truck to get a sports bag, and as I was walking out the door Mr. Mc.Hugh comes and freaks out, then asks me to get a pass. Mr. Laine was pissed, so he gave me a poster, and wrote in big letters on it, ""NICO TO TRUCK"" and I brandished it in Hugh's face. Mr. Rucki said my writing was beautiful and Mr. Festa said he looked forward to reading my final - Rucki gave me an A+ on the final, as he does all my work nowadays.

Everyone told me there'd be practice after school. I asked, when it started raining, if we'd still have it, and they said yes; it would clear up. It did, and I rushed out to the field, walking all the way there after school and organizing things with my mother so I didn't have to go. I waited about 45 minutes on a rock and noone showed up, and tried to run my path but it was all mud. As I began to walk a downpour started. I reached my mother's house and stayed for a bit. My contact really hurt my eye. I came home and relaxed from there. Sara cheered me up, along with Jen and all the people I care about.

I smell like someone right now, guess the perfume rubbed off on my shirt last time."

~Played Home Run Derby in Gym Class first period, and won. 
~Played Soccer and ran Heritage Trail + from 4-5:30. 

EDIT: [06/14/05]
Today is going to really, really suck. No matter what happens. Every possibility leads to a bad day. Maybe it's the lack of sleep that's getting me down, but I can't look forward to anything right now. I wish Sara lived here, or anyone I care for, for that matter.

I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave.
Trust me.

<Journal Entry> 
Today went by rather smoothly. I won Home Run Derby with only one chance to do it, hitting two major home runs to left field in the exact same spot, although the second one was hit much harder, to the dismay of Mike Jenkins, who had the lead and was catching for me. 

JENKINS: You're not going to do it. 
NICO: I'm not going to do it. :Hits Home Run that sails left: 
JENKINS: Looks like we're going to have to have a tiebreaker after this. 
NICO: Nope, no tie-breakers, sorry man. :Smacks another one, same spot but harder: 

I love my little premonitions. School was pretty uneventful. I ended up playing with Dario after school, and then going to the field to play Soccer with my cousin Brian, who, with his horrible aim, sent a ball flying over the fence. Once again, we couldn't find it. He drove around in his car randomly as I was literally knee deep in shit looking for it. Pissed, I went off and ran the long trail in the forest behind the field, up the hill and along the river, circling back through the Tennis Courts and making my way to the car. By then I was drenched in sweat and came home. Sara was online but disappeared even though I wanted to talk.  I drew many of my friends from the Fishing Forum, however. Nothing special, just short, 5-minute sketches. I learned much of the female anatomy! ^_^ My Gaia Journal has the pictures.

Bondage and girls, and girls in bondage. Doesn't get much better. But I put off a history essay.  

Buona Sera,

Even as we speak I am supposed to be taking a shower and readying myself for sleeping, but I just can't do it. T.S. recommends I meditate before bed, but I stopped meditating back when I stopped reguarly practicing Ki-Ken. Meditating on the matter may be helpful though, perhaps I'll do it tomorrow morning.

My stepmother's mother passed on, and she's going to North Carolina. Which leaves the house to me, seeing as my father works from 5-9. AM to PM. I have to care for my brother, then bring him to my grandparents and go to school afterwards.

I'm considering growing my hair long. My father wouldn't let me, but fuck it, I like it like that. I haven't shaved in days either.

"event","I woke up early this morning. I headed to the field, to set up for graduation. I was one of the first there. We worked until around 10:30, under commands of an amazingly anal Mr.Yacavace. I got along well with the guys there, but I find it hard to picture us becoming friends.

  I returned at 12, dressed in a black silk shirt, silver tie, long khakis, and shades. I wore a cooler over my shoulder, bringing 3 orange-waters. I knew it was going to be hot, but unlike the others, I wouldn't be suffering over it. I escorted teachers for a bit before watching graduation. I was the second-to-last person to leave, everyone else left almost as soon as it began, but I kept Leiah company a while and let her have one of my drinks. I don't know why I was kind to her, I had told myself I wasn't going to help anyone but myself for once.

  At about 3 I went to Chris Allard's party. For a while it was myself, Chris, and a mob of Italian people, but around 4:30 Ina, Jackie, and Magan showed up. Ina left pretty fast but Chris, Jackie, Magan and I hung out for a while. We were talking about Father Peter when, amazingly, he pulled up and joined the party, which was huge. A moment later my father pulled up across the street, and I hopped in with him to go to my cousin Brian's graduation party.

  That party was fun too. My other cousin named Brian was with a bunch of ghetto kids and as soon as I walked in the tent, they all went silence. I was like, ""What are you all silent about?"" And one replied, ""Smart kid in the room"". I looked at Brian, ""You've been talking about me haven't you?"" And he agreed, and I said something along the lines of, ""He brags about me because he doesn't have anything of his own to brag about."" I was kidding, but it won over the ghetto people. I know how to speak their language. Luckily, they left, and I had the tent to myself for a while.

  Then I met Ursela, a cousin of mine through recent marriages. She's from NH, but she's -awesome-. Dresses goth and was very nice. We talked under the tent for a long time, and I had a blast.

  I also met my cousin Amanda's friends, some junior high girls from Southbridge. They claimed to have seen me, yet I didn't ever see them. Strange, usually it's the other way around. Looks like I have some stalkers. Crazy girls, stay away.

  We got ready to leave, but the car wouldn't start. There was a faulty connection to the battery, as the AAA guy said a few hours later. I got home around 9:45, when I started my Hamlet essay. I'm done now, 6 pages down. 

  I feel strange and contemplative over things again..."

burningofatlanta: Aye.
xNoLeafClover5x: Do I uh, know you?
burningofatlanta: You've known me since middle school.
xNoLeafClover5x: I have?
burningofatlanta: Yes you have. You should know who this is.
xNoLeafClover5x: I should? Because I don't have much to judge on who it is.
burningofatlanta: We used to hang out every day after school.
xNoLeafClover5x: Chris Genet?
burningofatlanta: No.
burningofatlanta: Try again.
xNoLeafClover5x: You sure you're dialing the right number?
burningofatlanta: Hahaha. Yes I am.
xNoLeafClover5x: Chris Oathout? Nah, he's more illiterate. John Smith?
burningofatlanta: DING DING DING.
xNoLeafClover5x: WTF mate!?
burningofatlanta: Good job. It only took you three guesses.
xNoLeafClover5x: I knew it all along. I was just making you think I didn't know. It's reverse psychology, or something.
burningofatlanta: Yeah. Sure you were.
xNoLeafClover5x: How the asscrack did you get this name?
burningofatlanta: I had a few friends pull a few strings. Actually, I found you on Live Journal. I knew it had to be you.
xNoLeafClover5x: And why are you immolizing the capital of Georgia?
xNoLeafClover5x: I mean, granted, they and their peaches need to die.
xNoLeafClover5x: But that doesn't make it right!
burningofatlanta: Go there. You'll see what I have.
xNoLeafClover5x: Peaches?
burningofatlanta: Other than peaches.
xNoLeafClover5x: BLACK PEOPLE!?!?
burningofatlanta: Hahaha. No no no.
xNoLeafClover5x: Well damn, there's nothing else in Georgia except peaches and black people, so, I think you need to lay off the weed. 
xNoLeafClover5x: Yo, I saw you and Perry walking toward each other the other day.
xNoLeafClover5x: I was driving by that road that leads to Mc. Donalds and stuff, Perry was walking toward town, you were walking on the same sidewalk away from it.
burningofatlanta: I don't smoke weed. I actually started coke.
xNoLeafClover5x: I was like, collision course.
xNoLeafClover5x: You put the lime in the coke you nut and shake it all up.
burningofatlanta: God, I hate that one. Not that type of coke
...you nut. Cocaine.
xNoLeafClover5x: Why?
burningofatlanta: I've been going through some major issues lately. It keeps me calm.
xNoLeafClover5x: Oh, okay.

burningofatlanta: It's not. Don't ever do it.

burningofatlanta: But fun nonetheless.
xNoLeafClover5x: What, is it your birthday or just random?
burningofatlanta: Random.
xNoLeafClover5x: Cool.
burningofatlanta: There's going to be a lot of great guys and gals there.
xNoLeafClover5x: Like whi?
xNoLeafClover5x: *who?
burningofatlanta: People I just recently met. I don't know if you know them: Harry Arnold, Mark Snodgrass, Kristen Snodgrass, Joe Perdue (he's hilarious), Jesse Lester, etc., etc.
xNoLeafClover5x: Anyone from around here?
burningofatlanta: Nope.
xNoLeafClover5x: O_o
burningofatlanta: It's weird, I know, but it will be great.
xNoLeafClover5x: Why, what happened to the people you normally partied with. At erm, your sister's parties?
burningofatlanta: This is kind of a private party.
xNoLeafClover5x: Hmm..
xNoLeafClover5x: Hey, what's your LJ, I'll add you to my friends?
burningofatlanta: It's BYOCAC, too.
burningofatlanta: I don't have an LJ. I was on Jesse Lester's.
xNoLeafClover5x: Okay.
burningofatlanta: I'm thinking about getting one though. Are they free?
xNoLeafClover5x: Yeah, actually.
burningofatlanta:  Anyway, this party is going to be a little wild.
burningofatlanta: I want to see if you're up for it first.
xNoLeafClover5x: Oh?
burningofatlanta: If everything works out right, by the end of the night, it should be a good orgy.
xNoLeafClover5x: John, who did we have for English class in 7th grade?
xNoLeafClover5x: I was trying to figure that out.
burningofatlanta: No, you're trying to find out if it's the real me.
xNoLeafClover5x: Because it isn't, right?
burningofatlanta: Just accept that I've changed.
burningofatlanta: Yes it is.
burningofatlanta: God, you won't believe me.
xNoLeafClover5x: It's tough sometimes..
xNoLeafClover5x: I have a lot of people who would try to set me up.
burningofatlanta: This is why no one from here is invited. They don't understand anymore.
xNoLeafClover5x: Well, you remember Greg, from Megans parties and stuff?
burningofatlanta: I can't recall.
xNoLeafClover5x: How can't you, you and your friends hated him?
burningofatlanta: Still can't recall. Greg who?
xNoLeafClover5x: Lewis?
burningofatlanta: Lewis?
xNoLeafClover5x: Yes.
burningofatlanta: I still can't recall. What did he look like again?
xNoLeafClover5x: Meh, forget it...
burningofatlanta: Alright.
burningofatlanta: So are you up for an orgy or are you going to bail like so many others have on me?
xNoLeafClover5x: I wouldn't bail on you but the thing is, I'm not single anymore.
burningofatlanta: They can come also.
xNoLeafClover5x: Dude, her and I don't even have sex yet. She's not that kind of girl.
burningofatlanta: Then don't let her know about it.
burningofatlanta: C'mon, it's going to be great.
xNoLeafClover5x: It's a tempting offer, but I can't do it. I'm just not that kind of guy anymore.
burningofatlanta: Is it that or are you trying to let me down easy?
xNoLeafClover5x: Nah, I'm just faithful.
xNoLeafClover5x: Not the man I used to be.
burningofatlanta: I know what's going on. You just don't want to hang around me anymore. Orgy's too sick for you?
xNoLeafClover5x: Dude, we didn't hang around that much after junior high anyway?
xNoLeafClover5x: Not too sick for me, I used to be a pretty sick kid. You remember.
burningofatlanta: Y'know, I thought you would understand. I even thought we could do a little action on each other, but I guess not. It's too sick.
xNoLeafClover5x: I'm not bisexual.
burningofatlanta: It's an orgy. Accidents happen.
xNoLeafClover5x: I'm not the kind of guy you want to have an accident with.
burningofatlanta: Yes you are. I am attracted to you. You're a very handsome man.
burningofatlanta: But it's too gross for you to handle.
burningofatlanta: I can't believe you're judging me like that.
xNoLeafClover5x: I can't believe you're claiming I am.
burningofatlanta: You know you are.
xNoLeafClover5x: You might be just assuming too much.
burningofatlanta: I'm not assuming too much. I know this.
burningofatlanta: You're lucky I don't kick your ass now.
burningofatlanta: Tell anyone about my sexuality, I'll kill you.
xNoLeafClover5x: Kurtis, why are you posing as one of my old friends?
burningofatlanta: Who the fuck is Kurtis?
xNoLeafClover5x: I'd like to know myself.
burningofatlanta: I guess you don't remember me either.
xNoLeafClover5x: Can't say I do.
burningofatlanta: You've tortured me ever since jr. high.
xNoLeafClover5x: I've never talked to you since Jr. High.
burningofatlanta: No fuck you, nigga. You hated my guts.
xNoLeafClover5x: Okay, whoever you are, you do a really poor job impersonating people.
burningofatlanta: And you do a really <b>hard job</b> of covering up your sexuality.
xNoLeafClover5x: Why thanks, I'm glad I was a hard nut to crack. But who are you and why are you IMing me?
burningofatlanta: I am your worst enemy.
xNoLeafClover5x: Strange, I'd think my worst enemy would be a little less cowardly than to hide behind an IM screen and a false name.
burningofatlanta: You know what, I like you. You feel the same about people like me as I do.
xNoLeafClover5x: I'm glad. I'm not trying to make enemies.
burningofatlanta: Neither am I.
xNoLeafClover5x: So what are you trying to do then?
burningofatlanta: I'm trying to make you realize you have a sexuality problem.
burningofatlanta: It's ok to be a homosexual.
burningofatlanta: No one's going to care. Love is love.
xNoLeafClover5x: I'm not...?
burningofatlanta: Oh. Then my work is done.
xNoLeafClover5x: ...?

xNoLeafClover5x: Who is this?
burningofatlanta: The profile is a fake.
xNoLeafClover5x: On a different note, who am I?
burningofatlanta: You are a homosexual.
xNoLeafClover5x: Ironically, you're the one acting like you are. Funny how that works out.
burningofatlanta: I am homosexual.
burningofatlanta: Are you making fun of my sexuality prefrences?
xNoLeafClover5x: No, but you're acting pretty gay.
burningofatlanta: That's prejudice.
burningofatlanta: And hurtful.
xNoLeafClover5x: Prejudice is natural. Without prejudice, there would be no individuality.
burningofatlanta: Don't make me cut my arms with your bullshit.
xNoLeafClover5x: Go ahead. Threatening with suicide isn't exactly going to get you anywhere.
burningofatlanta: It'll get me in your pants.
xNoLeafClover5x: There's no room in there for you.
burningofatlanta: Cocky aren't we?
xNoLeafClover5x: Cocky is right. Nice word choice.
burningofatlanta: I try.
burningofatlanta: Those who brag are those who have nothing to talk about.
xNoLeafClover5x: Those who talk without a purpose are those with nothing better to do.
xNoLeafClover5x: So unless you have something you're getting at here, why don't you find something better to do?
burningofatlanta: You're right, I have nothing better to do at the moment.
xNoLeafClover5x: Apparently.
burningofatlanta: Very apparently.
burningofatlanta: It's either this, or go blind.
xNoLeafClover5x: Well at least one of the choices will get you somewhere.
xNoLeafClover5x: And it isn't talking to me.
xNoLeafClover5x: Unless you're going to clue me in on what you want?
xNoLeafClover5x: Well Kurtis, it's been interesting, but I'm heading off. If you want to clue me in on who you are and what you want, be sure to let me know, okay? See ya."

I rushed about and managed to get him a gift and went to the Bowling Alley for the party. I felt almost as if I wasn't involved. I spent most of the time pacing, leaning against the wall, cleaning, or helping with the children. Chrissy, my Godmother's daughter was there, and she's far different than I remember her being. She's grown a lot. I came back to my house to find we were going to a cookout tonight, which was a bit disheartening to me because I really didn't want to go. I wanted to make plans for Monday. I found out my father will be home for Monday, so I'm not quite sure what to do...privacy is a very wonderful thing. The cookout was relatively lame, and I'm exhausted. My allergies still are a bitch, but have died down thanks to a wonderful drug called psuedofedrine. Hey, FedEx bosses give their employees concentrated amounts of the drug to keep them working even when they're sick, and it works like a charm. Although it results in strokes. Sometimes the ends justify the means."

They're all gone now. I don't know what to do.

Sometimes I feel as if I'm not right for people...but, if I act on that feeling, based in my own remorse, I could make a decision that could ruin us both forever. Then again, if I stay with some of them, I may be devoting myself to something that won't fulfill my kismet in the end. 

My heart tells me to let fate take it's course and guide me where it will...but my father always taught me that I am responsible for everything that happens in my life and those around me.

Nearly another fight in History again. Bruso threw a paperclip at Gullek's eye. Brian voiced his anger and hit him on the shoulder with a paper ball, and sat down. Two minutes later while Gullek was drinking his Nestea, Bruso threw a History book right at his face. He has a huge mark on his forehead. Gullek went to kick his ass but Berry stepped in. I didn't make a move to break it up myself...I was raised on the idea to let men have their honor, don't meddle in other people's affairs.

My team won in Softball, of course.

There's been a downpour. And I tried working intensively on ONE piece of art but well...even though it came out really good, it smudged amazingly. Like, I touched it and a layer of solid graphite came onto my hand. My finger looked like it was made of a shiny metal, same to another kid who touched it. So maybe it wasn't a good idea. Whatever.

I was sort of sad today...I missed out on what's probably my last chance to eat with the friends I worked hard to make this year. And then had to sign a lot of their yearbooks. I left as many as my feelings as I could get out. Jackie said it was ""sweet"", no response from anyone else. I feel like I'm signing my life away, you know? I just met all these great people after all these years of being alone here in this town...and in a week, they'll be gone.

I feel like I should be doing something important. Nothing trivial like schoolwork. I mean, with my life.

I'll miss them all, and I won't ever forget my year in the sun. I'm glad not everyone around here is gone though...like Sara in Douglas, and...umm...well...

I watched the O.C.'s finale tonight, and it was really powerful stuff. Ryan finally found out the truth from his best friend that his brother Trey had tried to rape his girlfriend Marissa. Ryan, enraged, set out to settle it ""once and for all"". Ryan punched Trey and they talked angrily for a moment, then Trey pulled a gun on him and held it at him, threatening to shoot if he didn't turn around and leave. Ryan taunted him... ""Is this how it's going to end? You'll shoot your own brother?"" Trey started talking and Ryan dropped low and head/shoulder-butted him, knocking him over and the gun away. Trey got the upper hand however and beat the living snot out of Ryan and began to choke him to death. Marissa runs in, ""You're killing him, STOP, you're killing him!"" And picks up the gun when Trey gets the phone to smash Ryan's head in, and then she shoots him and music comes on. 

The acting was incredibly good for a drama show. The tone of voice Ryan used when talking to his brother, the final looks Trey gave to Marissa before he collapsed beside his brother in his own blood, and the effect of the music was staggering. I'm glad I saw it. 

I'm really looking forward tomorrow night. I tried on my tux, and I couldn't believe I actually looked pretty good in it. I had my hair cut earlier today, when I played with Jordan, although it was weird, I like, had no energy in my body, I could hardly move or swing a baseball bat.

"event","Driven by anger but also by an urge to resolve this conflict, I immediately talked to Shawn this morning. From what I could glean from our conversation, he's not guilty and I have no ill will toward him. He continues to attest it was not him and that it was someone else at the little get-together, or, more than one person.

I'm very glad I made peace with him, but I have other fish to fry in preventing future conflict.

I told Zachary Tucker to tell Sarah that I wanted to talk to her, seeing as she was the next most important person to talk to - I felt she was my friend, and besides, it WAS her screen name that was used for the incident.

But I didn't receive any affirmation that she wanted to have conference with me. Instead, Zack returned with a message from her: ""Fuck you."" She said a lot of other expletives, telling me to stop accusing people and it wasn't her problem - with a couple more swears laced in, of course.

And I have word from other people that in Chorus she said a lot about me, like I needed to stop pointing fingers and fight my own battles. Firstly, I didn't point fingers. I requested nothing more than a friendly conversation to see if she could HELP me, like a friend should, considering she was obviously involved. Secondly, I AM fighting my own battles. I'm not hiding behind messengers and computer screens. I offered her and anyone else a face-to-face conversation on the matter, and she denied me. So not only am I disheartened by her so scathingly rejecting me in a time of need, but I am far more suspicious that one of the guilty hands was hers. I sensed her corruption a few times before but I never thought she'd succumb to not even bothering to hear me out or talk to me. Be it drugs, bad company, or inborn contempt for others, my respect for her has waned today.

Tomorrow I see her in Forensics. Today I have other concerns, such as getting a haircut."

"event","Today was a great day.

I felt like an outsider in Southbridge though. As if I was the one person capable of coherent though in a cacophonous zoo of chaos and primal, animalistic fools. 

Sara helped me escape to Douglas, and we had a great time there, walking around.

I discovered goats' eyes look sideways. O_o

And Sara's parents are nice. Today will live on in my memories as one of the fondest times I've had.

Although I was weird a little later."

"event","Many people noticed the mark on my neck, including my mother. I'm wearing heavy clothing and a long, black hood to conceal it.

I bought some cheap ""insurance"" from someone at school.

And my father just came home, angry at me for not cleaning the yard of more weeds, which he told me to do yesterday. But I also just got home, so there was no time for me to do it. I told him that I would do it while there was still sunlight but he got mad and told me to do it tomorrow morning. I HATE it when people get mad at you for not doing something, then when you go to do it, they tell you not to."

"event","Some highlights of the week:
~I found that the key Jessie gave me works on more doors than just Mr.Andrews room. So far I've been able to unlock both Mr.Laine and Mr.Green's rooms as well. Green walked in just as I opened the door, and he was trying to figure out what ""trick"" I used, and I just insisted that I pushed the door open. I couldn't help but laugh when I turned my back to him and ran away with the key.
~Special Olympics were on Wednesday. It was retarded, and pardon my choice of words. I liked it though, it was a good cause and the participants all seemed very happy. Itoro sang the National Anthem, and did a great job, but then some weird lady came on and sang some really, really bad song about the beauty of special needs children. Good concept, horrible song.
~The top student honorary dinner was also on Wednesday. The top 10 juniors served the top 20 seniors, and then were locked away in a back room to eat their leftovers. I felt like a slave.
~Sara came over today, and we went to Friendly's."

"event","Wednesday was another empty day at school. Last period we had our last game of Wiffleball, Juniors versus Seniors as always. Unfortunately, I was called to the auditorium to receive an invitation to an Honor Roll breakfast. I ran up, grabbed the invitation, didn't look at it and ran to the gym.

When I got there the Juniors were losing, but they were glad to see me. I immediately went up to the plate and smashed into a double. Then the next batter hit the ball toward me, but, like the other team says, I have ""wheels"" and bolted home for our first run. The game went downhill from there, and I made a dramatic catch in which I bobbled the ball 2 times and caught it against the wall. We won 6-1, and are considered the best Wiffleball team in the school. So, being the best on the team, I just may be the best Wiffleball player in the school, but I'm not bragging and it's probably not true. I got 2 outs this entire Wiffleball season.

After school, my friend let me know that she thought her situation over, and everything's okay now. I'm lucky to have her as a friend, and all the grief that I endured over that particular episode was well worth the outcome - even if she does someday pursue her ex in that way, I have full confidence that she won't blindly rush into it, and that he'll do it for the right reasons. Though I do think that he should at LEAST offer to have her over on the night they were supposed to do what they were going to do.

Thursday flew right by, and Sara called, but was unable to pick up when I returned it. I went to Confirmation which was a lot less painful than I thought it would be thanks to my mother actually being kind and holding in her emotion, though I heard she was spiteful toward my father. The priest was being stuck-up and self-centered as always. As I walked to the church, I said, ""Good evening, Father."" And he didn't even bother responding! Instead he walked over to some Spanish family still in their car and talked to the people inside. During mass he looked very strange, and afterwards he just bolted, leaving the Bishop to take photos and stuff. The Bishop was great though, he said I looked like ""a million bucks"" in my gold/dull yellow/brown suit.

I wanted to go to bed early after, but there was a party at my house after, and most of my father's side of the family came over. Antonio, Mafalda, my godfather Pietro, my father, brother, stepmother, cousins Brian, Brian and Amanda, Uncle Jim, Aunt Rita, Sherrie, Angela, Christian, Nonno Remo and Nonna Anetta...it was packed. The food was excellent, but they all stayed until about 12:30. And then, I had to do homework - writing assignment, a take-home History Essay Test.

I got up early this morning, tired from a week of little sleep, and went on a field trip to Williamson at the Clark Art Institute. I zipped the sleeves and lining of my coat off and wore it as a vest, which was really handy - it looks good, and has like 50 pockets. The Seniors I'm friends with wanted me with them, but my teacher who had separated us into groups said I ""hurt his feelings"" by asking to be with them.

I snuck away during the tour and hung with them instead. I eventually found the other group after sneaking around the museum a while. Noone noticed - in fact, the Seniors didn't even notice until Beth turned around and was like, ""Nico! You snuck away?"" And jokingly chastised me. Jackie looked happy to see me, and at the Mall we had a bit of conversation about Prom and other things. I played hackeysack with some Juniors on the street to kill time. On the bus, Jessie gave me the key to the Math Department, which he would use to get in when he needed, and also help other kids get to class when they were locked out. He said when he realized he had to give it away since he was graduating, he knew I was the one to give it to because I was responsible or something.

There was a brief party at my mother's house after for Confirmation. She gave me a spiritual book and a journal to go along with it. I might stop writing here and start writing in that journal instead. 

SATs are tomorrow morning. I work good under pressure, but I really don't feel up to it.

Jen's grandmother passed away, and I feel horrible for her. I hope she can find solace somehow...

I miss Sara severely. And I'm tired."

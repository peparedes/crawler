[Dear <lj user=akas3n>.  One quick note about this journal before it is read.  Since this is a shared rp journal between <font color=orange>Lida</font> and <font color=red>Hit</font><font color=yellow>sugi</font>, that means that some of the entries won't correspond with other another. 

<u>Heres the deal</u>:

1.All entries marked with Lida's icon (Hint: Bright orange hair) correspond to <b>Lida's</b> entries.  
2.All marked otherwise correspond to <b>Hitsugi's</b> journal entries.
3.<b>**Neither man is aware of the other, and have NO connection whatsoever, so therefore this journal is essentially two rp journals mashed into one.**</b>

Thank you. <3 

Also. This journal is FRIENDS ONLY.  <3  Comment to be added.

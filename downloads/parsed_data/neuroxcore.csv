"event","Sometimes I truely feel like shit.  I hate it worse than anything when me and Eric get into arguments... things over our relationship, sex, feelings, serious things like that that involve emotion.  I really don't give a shit if someone reads this, or leaves a ""comment"", because I'm not writing it for them, I'm writing it for me.  It's 4:24 AM on a Sunday.. well now Monday morning, what could I possibly be doing up?  Besides the fact that I don't work Mondays anyways, I shouldn't be up at this hour, and most people are dead asleep by now.  I'm not sure if I'm here to write about anything in specific.. well at first I was but now I think I'm just writing about whatever.  I love Eric so fucking much, I'd do anything for that fucking guy.  He's my God damn world and if anyone took him away I'd fucking kill them with my bare hands.  I don't think I've ever been so sure that the guy I was with was the one.  And right as I'm writing this the man I love is bitching at me saying that I don't care about him.. ironic, isn't it?  Sometimes I'm not so sure being 16 is all I thought it would be.  Hormones at this age are the devil.  I've deattatched myself from the normal teenage world at this point pretty much and now going out to the movies with friends doesn't seem as exciting or fun as it used to.  When a man doesn't please a woman and doesn't feel pleasure during intercourse either, or visa versa, is it normal to feel disappointed or like your feelings have been crushed?  I think so but w/e.  I really do love Eric.. for God's sake if he isn't my other half, then I am going to die half empty.  My love for him is forever.  His beautiful face... I couldn't live without seeing it everyday or atleast hearing his voice that brings me such comfort..  But I'm .. pathetic.  That's all.  4:33 now.. My mind sometimes has problems resting.. you know so I can like fall asleep.  When I want to go to bed sometimes my mind stays busy and it makes it hard to fall asleep.  You know, I never thought I'd be so blessed as to fall asleep to the one I love the most, and wake up to his fucking beautiful face Friday through Tuesday every week.  And to what do I owe this amazing thing?  I don't know maybe I just got lucky.  It really truely feels good.. something I've never had before..... to love a man fully and his love be complete and equal and shared in return.  I really would be absolutely nothing without him.  And I've never, <i>ever</i> ment that more.  He is such a huge portion of my life at this point that my life would effortlessly collapse if he were to leave.  But I know he loves me and doesn't mean anything bad he says... and I don't have to convince anyone.

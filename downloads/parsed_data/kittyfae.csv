"event","You know, I've been going through a lot as it is, things haven't been very easy for me, I haven't felt social. It would seem because I didn't jump up and down acting all chipper, and share my distress with the world I'm now an evil person. That is fine. Frankly, I don't care anymore what the general populace thinks. There are a few near dear friends, that mean the world to me, that I know understand. It's funny that people come out of the woodwork, people complaining that clearly don't even have their own lives in order, people that have no clue what occurred, people that are being antagonistic because they think they are helping. 
This is the truth of the matter. All this came from me trying to keep my troubles to myself, not sharing them. That is how I am, if people are my friends they would know and understand that. Period."

"event","START THE NEW YEAR BY ""LARNING SUMPIN"" 

Look what happens when a President gets elected in a year with a ""0"" at 
the end. Also notice it goes in increments of 20 years. 
1840: William Henry Harrison (died in office) 
1860: Abraham Lincoln (assassinated) 
1880: James A. Garfield (assassinated) 
1900: William McKinley (assassinated) 
1920: Warren G. Harding (died in office) 
1940: Franklin D. Roosevelt (dies in office) 
1960: John F. Kennedy (assassinated) 
1980: Ronald Reagan (survived assassination attempt) 
2000: George W. Bush ???????????? 

And to think that we had two guys fighting it out in the courts to be 
the one elected in 2000. 

You might also be interested in this. 

Have a history teacher explain this----- if they can. 

Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846. 
John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946. 

Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860. 
John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960. 

Both were particularly concerned with civil rights. 
Both wives lost their children while living in the White House. 

Both Presidents were shot on a Friday. 
Both Presidents were shot in the head. 

Now it gets really weird. 

Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy. 
Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln. 

Both were assassinated by Southerners. 
Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson. 

Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808. 
Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908. 

John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839. 
Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939. 

Both assassins were known by their three names. 
Both names are composed of fifteen letters. 

Now hang on to your seat. 

Lincoln was shot at the theater named 'Ford.' 
Kennedy was shot in a car called 'Lincoln' made by 'Ford.' 
Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials. 

And here's the kicker....... 

A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland 
A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe. 

Creepy huh?  
Hey, this is one history lesson people don't mind reading 

This was sent by my gram, so thanks Gram!

"event","It was midnight when I woke...I was only of juice out of sodas, so decided to drive the 35 minutes to the highway and the mini-mart there, to buy something to drink. Please keep in mind, I've not had a lot in the house as I've not been out do to not feeling well. I get to the store and there is the clerk, and three gentlemen obviously of a middle-eastern decent.  Now, let me say that, here in redneck Illinois where I live...to see anyone not white is odd, but I have no racial prejudices whatsoever. So I paid no heed, and moved to the cooler to grab a drink, the following oocured:

Guy1: ""Mumbles""
Guy2: *laughs*
Guy3: *says nothing*
Guy1: ""Go on!""
Guy2: *approaches me* ""Hey honey""
Me: Hello..*goes on getting drinks (one juice one Pepsi) and walks around toward the register*
Guy2: *grabs my arm* ""Where ya going?""
Me: *growls* ""Let me go!"" *yanks my arm back, but he doesnt let go*
Guys1&3: *laugh*
Guy2: ""Hey baby, don't be mad lets play war"" *Grips my arm tight enough he bruises me*
Me: ""Hey how about we play lets take your fucking hand off me or I rip your nutsack off?""
Guy2: ""You'll like it I can occupy you, and you can examine my missile""
Guys1&3: *laugh*
Me: *smiles ever so sweetly, nods leaning in as if flirting, and drives my knee into his groin, then watches him double over* ""Geez I think your missile is out of commision bigboy"" *walks off and calls the cops*
Guy2: *lays there*
Guy1&3: *leave quickly*
Clerk:(Finally) Hon? You ok?
Me: ""Peachy, don't suppose when the guy GRABBED me you called the cops eh?""
Clerk: No sugar, I thought you knew him.
Me: By the way I was growling and pulling away?
Clerk: *falls silent*
Cop: Trouble Chrissy? (Clerk apparently)
Clerk *points at me*
Me: *Nods showing him my now deeply black & blue arm*
Cop: ""What happened?""
Me: *points to guy2*
Cop: ""Fucking Iraqis""
Me: ....

Pretty much after that was just reports ect...but what a bunch of assholes. A guy thinking because of his racial heritage that was amusing, a clerk, that was just a fucking idiot, and a redneck prejudice cop, I almost wanted to knee for his stupid comment MORE then the guy that hurt me. 
I'm sore tired and going to nap."

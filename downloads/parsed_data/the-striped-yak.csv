"event","Argh Labor Day weekend is leaving me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyway heres the rundown in a nicely organized list:

Friday: Piano+Wei-Li+April+me not caring about football games+crappy pep rally+making fun of jiwon+ Me&James's rap lessons = friday

Saturday:

Ok so basicly we thought we were going 2 go play soccer but turns out that only 3 out of 12 ppl can go play. Therefore the 3 that were left (me, nate, eric) desiced to just play risk(me+eric form an allince so we can finish the game in an hour instead of 5) and squash nate's puny nation. Then came FIFA street and Eric let me borrow it thereby  supplying me with lots and lots of entertaiment. Then we (me+jiwon+lisa+james) went to go play tennis. It was interesting cept i think i have tennis elbow which is pissing me off T_T. Anyways Wei-Li+April arrived an hour later and we had massive tennis partay consiting of us playing tennis and making fun of Bi. Then i went home and played FIFA Street and made my created guy awesome(not to mention he's completely decked out in Adidas.

Sunday: Morning= FIFA Street. Then at 5 i went to James's house for a party-type thing which consited of FIFA Street(james=magic half court shots) and Mechwarrior(which i now think is a hella fun game though it is quite nerdy but i finally got good at it so now im godly and totally pwn james LOL)

Monday: Me finally having to do HW T_T+X_X

*edit*
i have no clue if my Adv. Alegbra asignments are acually worth any points........i hate that class lol
btw if anybody looks at my music box type thingy it has a french rock song in it which i found kinda randomly on somebodys radioblogclub entry but its awesome so if you can find it listin to it lol."

James: At least im not white
Me: he's got a point there..........

Orchestra was awesome. We watched a video and then just messed around the rest of the time. James tried to do the jump and touch both your toes thingy and fell and i tried to do it and it hurts very very much.

yeah i was feeling deep during math class

and then i went home and played tennis with jenny, but the these AHS peeps took over, and we had to leave, and so then jenny came to my house and we watching Gilmore Girls (which is an awesome show that i secretly love)

Yea, so anyways it was just lots of messing around all fun like. I have pics but i won't have them posted till Monday soooooooo JUST WAIT IN SUPER DUPER ANTICIPATION!!!!!!!!!
In the mean time, here's another blog thingy!!!!!!!!!
*MASSIVE NEW PART ADDED AT 7:45 AM 4/30/05*
Ok so first i went 2 Legends which is some awesome sports bar. It has many many T.V's and its hard to ""do your buiness"" when ppl are looking at the T.V above the urinal x_x.............
Ok so then we all got rides 2 the formal which is pretty awesome as mentioned above. The theme wasn't THAT bad cause we got necklaces that were kinda dumb and ICEES!!!!!!!which arnt dumb but they're awesome.
I couldn't find my science partner x_x so that sucked.
But there was lots of partying and lots of yelling and there was breakdancing!!!!!
Jenny was really really hyper and went around poking ppl.
Bryan is AWESOME

The Idealist

You are creative with a great imagination, living in your own inner world.
Open minded and accepting, you strive for harmony in your important relationships.
It takes a long time for people to get to know you. You are hesitant to let people get close.
But once you care for someone, you do everything you can to help them grow and develop.

You would make an excellent writer, psychologist, or artist.</table>

So anyways combined orchestra is awesome cause its better than regular orchetra though, thats not saying much   
also, the formal's in 9 dayz and the theme sux. I am blaming James Chang for it.
Also, Ex. P.E swimming was yesterday and that rocked. Lots of football and stuff. Unfortunatly, people like Alec and other ppl in the gang rape football grabbing orgy made it very very very gay x_x so that sucked.
In regular P.E i learned that Tall Kevin+ Short Hoop+massive strength= Lotsa dunking on people's heads.

Saterday - ACT, Phanthom of the Opera
Advertisment(little girl speaking): Take me fishing, because im getting married sooner than you think.
Max: THAT LITTLE WHORE!!!
Jenny: *wtf omfg* Max!!!(smacks max)
I ruin movies for other ppl lol.

The ACT sux its a lot less boring then it seems.

Sunday - Did nothing

Monday- School, then nothing

Tuesday - English was awesome. For our poem thing Mr. Van Slyke played ""In My Life"" which was awesome then we watched the Simpson's Raven. That was awesome.
""Quote the Raven 'EAT MY SHORTS'""


When i got home i watched my weekly epidsode of Scrubs. Freaking hillarious.
""Remember the time you had sex with (insert his ex's name,I forgot it) during your engagement? Or how about the time you had kissed that stripper?""

""Dude, that was you""

""Yeah, but i used your name"""

See me comin' to town with my souls
Straight down at the world of my fingers

Take your eyes and the knife to the bone
Shoot your mouth if you know where you're aimin'
Don't forget to pick up what you saw
Talkin' trash to the garbage around you

Na na na na na na na

"event","Ok, i don't really kno wut to put. But i played some tennis this weekend but I'm still waiting to order my new racket......Anyway Orchestra was pretty good. Lauren kept laughing at me during orchestra.....idk why.......... so we sorta had a lot of missed enterances. Then John came in during a solo and it was hillarious and i started laughing and i messed up......i was really hyper today and i kept laughing and being easily amused. Example: Me:""Hi Kelly, I EAT BABIES!!!!!!(makes gesture of eating one)"" Kelly with a WTF expression on her face*""Oh my god Max thats disturbing"" yea............So...to fill up space heres some lyrics!!!!!!

Cellophane flowers never happened for me
I've been sleeping the day off, watching the night fall, covering nowhere
Filling my timeshare
There's a woman in the mirror in a fiery state
As she motions to me, I start turning a way
And she's lifting her dress up,
Trying to keep up

Oh, you'd be surprised!
How we race
While our lives
Erased


Oh and i got a 42 on the pacer which is ok but i wish i ran more."

"event","Have you seen that new Adidas commercial with the smart shoe? I think the music to it is cool and i think the commerical is cool too. Anyway Orchestra is shit all we do is mess around. 
    Mrs. Friend is trying to make us play slower when she could just root out the REAL problem: TELL ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SUCK TO STOP SUCKING!!!! STUFU!!!!!My plan: kick out the following people. James C. Enrique,and Racheal w/e her last name is, and about half the 7vies. I think this plan would be very efficiant in solving our problem(if anybody else wants to add names plz comment below) 
      Anyway Im gonna buy a new racket soon. Its gonna be the Orange liquidmetal thing. Its awesome. I managed to break my other one x_x on a  overhead so yea........... Anyway im playing tennis 2morrow(yay!).                    Jenny's leaving and that sux but she's in our english class 2morrow so thats gonna be awesome. Basicly, Friday is gonna be awesome. 
      Anyway my sister is having some stomach problem type thingy. I feel sorry for her. Hope she gets well soon!!!!!!"

HOW DEPRESSING
ZIDANE HEADBUTTING THAT DUDE WAS THE BEST FUCKING THING IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE

ALL IVE BEEN DOING LATELY IS THINKING ABOUT THE GOODLIFE
WHILE DRINKING CHEAP BEER AND LISTENING TO EUROPEAN DANCE MUSIC
GOTTAGO

IF YOU JUMP ON THE TABLE AND START SINGING I WILL SURVIVE AFTER EATING THEIR WAFFLES SUBING IN LYRICS THAT FLAME THEIR FOOD........ YAH GOOD LUCK COMING BACK.  BUT IF IT IS ANY CONSULATION (AND IT IS) WE WENT HOME AND FOUND A WAY TO MAKE PANCAKES WITH BEER.

DO I LIKE ALMOST FOOD.........WHAT THE HELL IS ALMOST FOOD???   WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS MALT LIQUOR AND ELVIS IMPRESONATORS AND PRANKING TOLL FREE NUMBERS AND MOONWALKING ON BALCONYS IN MY UNDERWEAR.  

I CANT WAIT TO BE A SENIOR AND WEAR HAIRNETS AND SMELL LIKE MOTHBALLS.  ID HAVE A FANNY PACK AND PLAY SHUFFLEBOARD AND GIN RUMMY ALL THE TIME.  AND ID BE CHAINSMOKING SO MUCH THAT THE AIR AROUND ME WOULD ALWAYS BE BLUE AND MY GRAY HAIR WOULD BE TINGED YELLOW WITH NICOTINE.  ID KEEP DENTURES IN A CUP BUT NOT HAVE FALSE TEETH........ AND ID ALWAYS CALL PEOPLE SONNY AND ACT LIKE I HAVE DEMENTIA.

BRIEFCASES ARE ONLY GOOD IN TERRORIST ATTACKS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE AN EASIER METHOD OF IDENTIICATION.  THE POLICE WILL COME AND THEY WILL SAY, 

COP ONE - OH CRAP LOOKS LIKE DONALD SO'N'SO GOT PISSED OFF AND BLEW UP THE BUILDLING.
COP TWO - YAH LETS GO FIND HIM.
COP ONE - YOU WANT TO GRAB A COFFEE FIRST?
COP TWO - YAH DOUBLE DOUBLE.  LETS GET DONUTS TOO.
COP ONE - NO BECAUSE THAT WILL GO RIGHT TO MY THIGHS.
COP TWO - YAH I DIDNT THINK OF THAT.

AND THEN IT WILL GO ON AND ON BECAUSE COPS ARE STUPID AND IM DOOGIE HOWSER AND IM THE SMARTEST MAN ALIVE.  I HAVE AN MD FOR CHRIST SAKE."

WEVE OPENED UP A DISCO TECK AND A YOGA CENTER IN MY LIVING ROOM AND THINK ITS FUN TO DANCE AROUND AND SING EN VOGUE.

MAYBE ITS JUST THE BEERS TALKING ABOUT US BEING THE HOTTEST COUPLE OUT THERE.
I HAVE HAD A FEW TONIGHT.

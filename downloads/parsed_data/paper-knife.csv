even now when its almost midnight the sky is still lit, not by stars, not by the campfire, but by, magic? 
somebody has to teach me to wear skirts again. pretty skirts and dresses, and to wear my hair like a girl again. it's there but it's not.

sometimes i cough and then i swallow and swallow to get rid of the taste of blood. sometimes i wonder where you are. if i might bump into you today. sometimes i go looking for you and then i find you, in the strangest places. we never have much to say, we have already discussed the past and dreamt the future. all that matters is our actions. our runs and hides, the things we steal and give away, our tears while we smile, our hysterical laughter that follows, your hand in mine or just the longing of our fingers.
lately i've been wondering if the only way to be true, is to deny.)"

a few months earlier perhaps i would have said how i would love to break your bones and see you suffer but it won't matter now. the way i experience is the way you never will. and that is enough.

my victory)

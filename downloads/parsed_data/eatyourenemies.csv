The cold from the sheets is the only thing keeping me convinced this is real.


I turned off the light, and joined hands with conciousness as I went back into an empty bedroom, but instead I locked eyes with Mike, smiling, because Mike always fucking smiles and it always comforted me until now.  I don't remember what I said.  All I remember is the burning in my cheeks, and the evaporation of whiskers slowly deleting themselves from my face forever.  Repetitivley damning the moist trails drowning the ivory paint that suffocated my pores, and I, for the first time, began to feel guilty for the act, finding within me and it a whirled relation.

There was constant screaming, and swearing, and laughing. It was great. I needed a life outside the showplace 8, outside Galesburg, and I guess a green station wagon was just the ticket.

When I got to his car I didn't see it anywhere so I started looking through stuff in the back seat to run across a girl's belt, a pair of girl sandals, sunglasses, and a 50 cent cd, and all of a sudden I felt unbelievabley sick... i thought i knew him so well, and it turn out.. i was dating someone who likes... 50 cent?!  Going inside I told him I couldn't find it and he got it, i didn't say a word until we got back to his car and he said ""what's wrong with you?"" I was afraid to mention it, but I swallowed my fear and confronted him by saying ""what the hell is with all the girl stuff in the back seat?"" his response resembled somthing like ""what the fuck are you talking about?!"" I turned around to show him when it was all gone and replaced with a guitar and a skateboard.. to realize, I spent like 10 minutes going through someone else's shit that ended up looking nothing like David's car, that night I went home and slept for 13 hours.. best decision I've ever made."

"event","agh, my first ap government test tomorrow, basically, I'm terrified.  I'm lost in there.  I did get my grammar and comp done, it's got me so excited, it was an application essay to Columbia, I spent so much time on it, that it's pathetic, but it's definitley worth it, only if I could get myself to spend that much time doing schalarships..  

Man, me and Earf thought this crazy idea to make up really erotic as heck letters and send it to a teacher from another teacher at ghs and create some really fucked up love triangles. So, this is your chance to vote on who's involved. I think Mrs. Truelove is a must-have, but give your input, pretty pretty pleasse.  I'll post the letter later, god, I never knew I could be such a slut, it's disgustingly awkward.


hm, that's about all.
lovvve you."

"event","I talked to my dad today about college
and we finally decided on something that doesn't involve me exploding
and everything goes sweetly I Could  be starting Northern Illinois in Dekalb next fall, and I wont be ENTIRELY alone, I mean there's always Dug, even though we're not super duper tight er anything. It's just.. not Galesburg.

Agh, I can't explain what I'm feeling now, and I just feel emo trying.
All I do is write and read anymore, and it's the only thing that makes me happy, I feel so fucking cliche but I can't sleep and I'm never hungry, and I force myself to eat, I'm just sick, and anxious and tired and serious all the time anymore.  I have no car, i'm on medication that wont allow me to sleep.. ever, I lost my best friend and just overall person I placed all of my hope in, and I'm just overwhelmed.. with everything, and I feel so fucking teenage-angsty.  

I started saving my money, I'm not spending any.
it's only $80.
but that's just in a week of working, within a year it'll be enough,
and I'll have a car soon when the guy's insurance company get's it settled, and I'll have more to look forward too.
I just can't think about this anymore,
but it's like I can't think about anything else either.
Last night I said everything to him, I said everything I was, I cryed for three and a half hours, just telling him.. everything, everything I couldn't even admit to myself...  He held me, and kissed me, and told me it was a mistake, and I got a tissue to wipe my face and I turned around, and it was all gone... just like that.  And... I hate him, and I'm just not in reality anymore.. I don't know anything about what we're talking about in school, everything in this town just reminds me.. and I can't stand it.. and I hate him, for lying, and promising, and leaving me when I did nothing..

everyone just kept talkng about the wreck today, people I barely knew, and asking questions and it's like.. I don't know.  I can't  even concentrate, I just think of David, and how he was everything and a year and a half, and we were perfect, and now I'm just some obsessive ex-girlfriend.  I really, I don't care about the wreck, I mean, right when my car stopped, the first thing I though  of was calling David.  I'm so fucked, and I don't know how I got like this, and I'm complaining.  And, tomorrow I'll be okay and I'll probably delete this entry, but it's just... I have to call him.. but there's nothing else to say.. he knows everything. And he's just.. gone."

I think recent events in my life deserve a tribute to embrace the responsibility I've recieved,
a wise woman once made a truely profound statement to really capture these significant stepping stones in a woman's life..

""All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me

"event","I'm HOMEE!!
The last week of my life has been amazing.
Warped and camp.
it was such a break with reality,
and random crazyness.
I'm glad to be home with order,
but I still miss it all a lot.

I don't think I persued one councilor-like duty in my whole time of being at camp, just like a giant camper who murdered everyone at four square and phoos-ball. Yeah, that's right, meet the Jr. High master, biotch. Things went from cool to effin' awesome after the rain on uhhh.. Tuesday?  the entire camp played capture the flag in the mud, it was effing SWEET.  Me and this eighth grader were chasing this guy with the flag trying to cut him off from opposite sides, then when we saw that we were gonna slam into eachother we went to stop, but we just ended up sliding on the mud and we hit mid-air, like horizontally, and we did like 2 flips each and he landed right beside me. It was like a fucking acrobatic materpiece.  Oh boy, how I missed the camp life.  They even started the most christian mosh-pit I've ever seen to the church songs, it was laughable, but quite fun. I loved my cabin.  All my campers kept making me things at arts and crafts, it was the sweetest thing ever. I really wished I could've stayed till the end, but I messed up my ankle playing this game involoving a giant ball, which in short lead to leaving camp, spending two hours in the emergency room, and getting xrays all proving that it was a waste of time and money. Tonight's suposed to be the sentimenal bon fire and song-singing, hand-hold, eye-crying, extravaganza, I'm sad I'm going to miss it, and that I didn't get to say goodbye.. to anyone, but I actually slept last night, and NOTHING can ever repalce that in my heart. 

Warped was awesome as well,
I actually don't remember it real well,
two hours of sleep the night before and 
a week of randomness may have something to do with it.
I met this kid who used to go to ghs there.
Erron Bouvia, what a cool person,
I wish I knew him at a time when he didn't live across the country, but whatever.
Motion City was so.. yay.
It was so packed, so loud, so energetic, so everything that makes a show worth going to..  God, I love this summer.

Gwar, well, I think I'm going to do some of that tv watching.
most likely I'm going to be doing a lot of that the next couple days due to my ankle.  So if you have no plans, call me, come over, do something that doesn't involve me being alone the rest of the week. I start work on Wednesday, I can't wait. Yay."

"event","I bought my Warped tour ticket today.
I decided I love making decisions about going to shows 4 hours away in 24 hour notice, much better than pleading my dad for months then getting an apathetic ""no"" at the last minute (i.e. the year before, and the year before that, and the year before that, etc.)
..17's a good age, I highly suggest it.

Then on Sunday I'm headin' off to CHURCH CAMP
I'm figuring on my ego being around 46 times larger when I return, nothing quite puts you on a higher level of self-confidence then when you choose to enslave your first set of 7th graders for a week.
Plus my fellow councilor seems cool, we're totally breaking the rules by bringing scented candles, candy, and CD's.. aghhh!! I feel the anarchy posessing my already.

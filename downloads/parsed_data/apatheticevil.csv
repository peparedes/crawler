<lj-cut text=""Red Carpet (RPS, G)"">
It's unbelievable, thinks Elijah, that any man could be that beautiful.
 
He's standing on the red carpet, and Dom's leaning closer to say something, but his attention is glued to the man currently being mobbed by photographers, interviewers, handlers.
 
""How difficult was it working in Romania?"" He hears.
 
""And of course you're nominated tonight...""
 
""We just spoke to Nicole, and...""
 
Elijah can't take his eyes off the perfect skin, the flawlessly messy hair, the pink lips forming responses to questions he'd no doubt been asked a thousand times before. There's a crease in his brow as he considers a response to the next question, and a flash of tongue wets the corner of his mouth. Elijah squeaks softly as he exhales.
 
Then for a moment, scanning the crowd as he talks about harsh Romanian snowstorms, Jude's crystal blue eyes land on Elijah and Elijah can feel a blush rise to his cheeks. He quickly looks away, his face hot, his head filling with a dizzying embarrassment.
 
""Hey."" Dom snaps his fingers before Elijah's face, tearing his attention back to earth. He's smirking, and Elijah's blush grows hotter."

""Its pace does not slow!"" Legolas cried. He looked back just in time to see Andrew stop halfway across the bridge, then turn to face the demon. ""No!"" The elf lunged forward but was restrained by Boromir. ""Andrew!""

""Hey, Balrog!"" Andrew planted his feet firmly on the stone and stood tall against the creature. ""No way are you passing!"" For emphasis, he crossed his arms over his chest and narrowed his eyes.

The monster's nostrils flared, and it spread massive wings as it stepped forward.

Andrew reached a hand into his jacket pocket. ""Dude, no."" His fingers tightened around an object. ""You're. Not. Gonna. Pass.""

The Balrog raised its whip and cracked it at Andrew.

Though dwarfed by the monster, he didn't move, or even flinch at the gesture. ""If you strike me down, I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.""

Fire burnt in the demon's eyes as it approached.

""Fine,"" Andrew smirked. From his jacket, he pulled something that glowed a blinding, holy white and thrust his fist in the air. Immediately, the beast gave a pained shriek and stumbled backward.

""Vile beast! Servant of Melkor!"" Andrew's voice echoed around the chamber. ""I order you back to the evil pit and/or hellish inferno you came from!"" He paused. ""I mean, from whence you came!""

The Balrog shrunk back from him like an unwatered ficus. Pacing toward the demon, Andrew held the light aloft as he drove it back, and, unable to see through the piercing white brilliance, the Balrog lost its footing and tumbled from the bridge into the endless black abyss beneath.

Andrew turned back to the group, who were watching in awe. He gave a humble smile.

""That was amazing,"" Aragorn remarked.

""Incredible."" Gandalf moved forward first, leaning on his staff as he walked. ""Is that...?""

With a nod, Andrew held out his open palm. A glowing jewel rested in its center. ""A Silmaril.""

The hobbits stared, entranced by the shiny thing.

""The Silmarils were lost!"" Legolas gaped at the gem, light reflecting off his golden hair.

Andrew shook his head. ""Not all. There was a fourth,"" he explained, lowering his voice in reverence. ""A fourth Silmaril. I am its guardian. Only in the hands of one not from your world would the Silmaril be safe, so it was entrusted to me by the Valar.""

""Good thing you had it in your pocket,"" said Pippin, ""or else we probably would've gone down with that beastie.""

Andrew smiled enigmatically. ""Oh,"" he said, ""not all of you...""

<lj-cut text=""a MarySue!Andrew ficlet"">
He adjusted the circlet resting upon his hair, and stepped into the courtyard of Rivendell. ""I am Andrew Wells,"" he announced, ""half-elf of Sunnydale, sent by Buffy the Slayer of the Vampyres as a trusted representative to your Council of Elrond."" 

Andrew was shorter than the surrounding elves but they looked on his beauty with envy. He had shiny golden hair, red lips, eyes that changed from blue to green to grey to violet with his mood, and very straight teeth. Because of his elf blood, he could work magic. And also, he was really good with a sword, which he wielded against the forces of darkness and ass-kicking funnel cakes.

""My nephew!"" Elrond stood and spread his arms. ""Brave half-elven Andrew of Sunnydale, son of my wayward brother Harold!"" He enveloped Andrew in a warm hug, then led him to his reserved seat in the council circle.

""If I am not mistaken, Uncle Elrond,"" said Andrew, eyeing the stump in the center, ""that is The One Ring!""

An unfamiliar yet musical voice answered. ""Indeed it is, brave Andrew of Sunnydale.""

He looked up to see from where the voice came, and locked eyes with the most beautiful elf he'd ever seen. The world stopped around them -- birds hung in mid-flight, everyone blurred into the background.

""Andrew?""

He snapped back to reality. ""Yes, Aragorn?"" From the corner of his eye, he saw the elf turn his head and blush.

The ranger addressed him. ""What do you suggest we do with the ring?""

""Why should we listen to some kid?"" Boromir growled, casting a nasty look at Andrew.

The pretty elf leapt to his feet. ""This man aided the Slayer in the destruction of the Hellmouth!""

Ooh, thought Andrew, he's heard of me!

He gave it a moment's thought, then said, ""I think... we should destroy the ring.""

""That is a brilliant idea,"" said the beautiful elf, beaming at Andrew.

""Yes, Legolas, it is a brilliant idea."" Elrond gazed with pride at Andrew, thinking how much like his brother, Harold Halfelven, he appeared. Minus the pointy ears, naturally.

Legolas, Andrew thought, so that is his name!

""I will take the ring to Mordor,"" came the small voice of Frodo, the blue-eyed halfling.

Boromir snorted. ""The heck? Have you seen those black gates? Not with ten-thousand men could you do that!""

""Actually,"" Andrew pointed out, ""he is small enough that he could sneak in the back way, through Ithilien, and the pass of Cirith Ungol.""

The council considered this.

""Only,"" Andrew continued, ""He will need this."" And from his pack he pulled an industrial-sized can of Raid for Roaches and Spiders. ""Just trust me on this one.""

""Not only brave and handsome, but wise as well."" Legolas smiled flirtatiously and fluttered his lashes at Andrew.

Aragorn approached Frodo. ""You have my sword,"" he said, kneeling.

""And you have my bow,"" added Legolas.

""And my oven mitts!"" Andrew said without hesitation.

Wrote this a while ago, forgot to archive it. My first foray into LOTR slash. It's short and contains ROTK spoilers.

<lj-cut text=""Ficlet: Waking (Aragorn/Faramir, PG)"">
* * *

Faramir shrugged off the chill of his deathless limbo and felt the warmth and discomfort of life return to him.

Seemingly, he'd been accompanied back to the waking world by that thick black in-between; memories of the past days lay beyond Faramir, just out of reach, and no amount of strain of thought could bring them near.

He, of course, did not expect his brother at his bedside, for the inner void left at Boromir's death was still painfully evident even in this hollow state. Nor did he expect his father -- though, much later, that pain would be lessened upon learning the Steward had been dead, and not that he'd abandoned his son to the nurses and to fate.

Then, like a fatal blow, Osgiliath returned to Faramir. There'd been a final feeling of utter panic before the darkness took him -- this was the very end of his memory, stabbed by this sharp panic, warm, wet, sticky. Now, there remained torn scraps of dread, broken by dull regret. 

Atrophied muscles protested as he rolled to his side, and the cloth bandages bunched and pulled at his fevered skin.

""Faramir?""

The voice and the room swam together as Faramir's senses struggled back to life. From the curtained windows, bright sunlight turned the room the color of buttermilk, and he squinted against the brilliance at the dark figure beside his bed. 

""Aragorn,"" he said, and his voice tasted like smoke.

""You have at last returned to us."" A warm smile broke the king's tired face.

The sudden dumbness that struck Faramir could be excused by whatever treatments had been administered while he slept. The lump in his throat, the swelling in his chest -- that could not. ""Yes,"" he exhaled. ""Your voice,"" and he remembered, ""Your voice beckoned me home.""

His hand rose, tentatively, and his arm cursed the effort. Numb fingers brushed the face of his king, his savior, stilled for a moment against the stubbled jaw, and faltered under the strain of the gesture.

Before it could drop, Aragorn's own palm pressed against the weakened hand and held it static against his skin. Faramir's eyelids flickered and fell, and the bright world outside bled through.

Grey eyes narrowed at her nemesis. Across the room, tendrils of crisp hair waved around Kathleen's face as she threw her head back in loud, crackling laughter. It was the last straw. The camel's back was effectively broken.

Flannery snapped open her CD player, inside which was concealed a weapon kept for such emergencies. It was a good mix, this one, and Flan was sorry to see it destroyed, but her last fibers of sanity depended upon the destruction of this foul, cackling creature.

Leaping up onto her workstation and with a cry of ""Return ye to the Pit, bitch!"", our heroine flung the deadly disc at the unsuspecting target. The projectile embedded itself in the woman's throat and her hyena-like laugh was cut off in mid-guffaw. 

Kathleen was rocked backward by the blow, but due to her unholy heritage, was not killed. Blood and words bubbled forth from her mouth. ""You cannot slay me!"" Unsteadily, she righted herself, her nearly severed head swaying on the torn neck. ""And you cannot slay the child I carry!""

A chill came over Flan. That baby's birth could possibly kill the beast that bore it. But what greater evil could that child possess? What unspeakable horror fathered the child, and what beast blood would run in its veins?"

This building can't be any colder than the outside, but it certainly isn't much warmer. The only benefit to being inside, thought Flannery, was the lack of rain. However, the inside had the unbearable Kathleen, and so Flannery honestly thought it was a draw as to which was least hospitable environment.

Outside, everything was washed in grey. It wasn't clear whether it was actively raining, but cars drove slowly past with headlights on and the streets were shiny. There seemed to be some definate precipitating going down, if not presently, then soon before.

She remembered this sweater being more snug in weeks past. It amused Flan briefly to think that she'd literally <i>lost</i> weight, having no idea where or why it went, and how it could've gone anywhere with the amount of food she'd consumed over the recent holidays. 

With around an hour of sleep to keep her through the day, our heroine spent her day -- and indeed is still spending it -- staring blankly at a computer screen. Flannery wasn't daydreaming of slaying dragons or kissing movie stars. Instead, that screen reflected behind her eyes and back, back, back into her head like a broken machine in a house of mirrors."

Dedication: Happy birthday, Anna! As one of only two journal users with ""beating paul mccartney up"" listed as an interest, you deserved a happy birthday. I say deserved, of course, because this is an entire week late. Feel free to kick me. In the head. Nine times. :)

*   *   *

The hour was indeterminate. The party was in its death throes, and streamers hung limp from the doorway. A few balloons had miraculously made it through the celebration in their inflated state. Its three participants were gathered around a low coffee table -- one seated on the beige carpet and another sprawled on the sofa with the birthday boy on his lap. Each wore a small cone-shaped party hat, except for Andrew, who wore a shimmering birthday tiara.

Warren licked a smudge of icing from the corner of Andrew's mouth. ""Happy birthday, babe.""

""Yes,"" agreed Jonathan. ""The happiest!"" 

Andrew took a deep breath and smiled. He beamed at Jonathan. ""I didn't think you'd make it.""

""Of course I made it."" Jonathan frowned, seeming almost offended at the suggestion he'd be anywhere else. ""I'd never miss my best friend's birthday.""

""Yeah. Couldn't miss it."" Warren nuzzled his face against Andrew's hair. Andrew felt him smile, felt Warren's warm arms tighten around his waist. ""We both wanted to be here for you,"" he told Andrew, punctuating the statement with a kiss atop his head.

Candles on the cake smoldered into smoke and outside, a bright and beautiful full moon had risen. Something vague nagged at Andrew from the depths of his mind, and he creased his brow in thought. From far away he channeled what was troubling him: ""I was so lonely,"" he said quietly. ""I had a cake, and... and nobody came...""

Then Warren's hands cupped the sides of Andrew's face and he found himself drawn into a bone-melting kiss. Negative feelings lingering in his mind dissolved. ""Don't think about that,"" Warren said. He gently slid the tiara off and combed his fingers through Andrew's hair, then kissed him again. ""That isn't what's happening.""

""Ahem.""

The pair parted reluctantly and looked up. Jonathan was standing next to them, holding a shiny black box. He smiled and said, ""I hope you like the present I got you. It took me, like, forever to pick it out, and I had it gift-wrapped.""

""It looks very nice, Jonathan."" Warren took the box from him and placed it on Andrew's lap. 

""Open it!"" Jonathan encouraged.

Andrew pulled on the silver ribbon tied around the box and it opened easily, like yarn unraveling. Inside was a small phial of liquid, clear but with a faint peach-colored glow that lit the dark space inside the box like a candle. Mesmerized, Andrew lifted it upward. ""It's perfect,"" he breathed.

*   *   *

Willow pressed the small container into Andrew's hand and wrapped his limp fingers around it. His head lolled on his shoulder as he slept and he exhaled soft puffs of air -- the very image of peaceful slumber.

Whispering, she instructed, ""Chant, Dawn."" 

Dawn did as she was told. The language was something unrecognizable and she had no idea what she was saying, but she trusted Willow to guide her right.

""I knew you'd love it,"" Jonathan was telling Andrew, deep in his dream. ""It tastes like sugar water. Drink it all...""

Willow guided Andrew's hand to his mouth. He swallowed the liquid in one gulp.

*   *   *

Warren pressed his lips to Andrew's ear, and Andrew squirmed as he whispered warm, moist words: ""You'll get your present from me later.""

""Ooh."" Andrew felt his cheeks go red. ""I want it now!"" The very air was pressuring Andrew that this couldn't last forever. As wonderful as seeing Jonathan was, Andrew was aching to lie warm and secure against Warren's chest before time ran out and the world dissolved.

He slid off Warren's lap, then pulled the other man up from the sofa. ""You'll love the bedroom,"" Warren mentioned as they wandered hand-in-hand into the hallway. ""It has a canopy bed, and that glow-in-the-dark Star Wars comforter you had when you were six.""

It was a short walk to the end of the hallway. Faintly, he wondered what Jonathan would do while they were gone, but the though didn't concern him. He was in awe as he entered the room; it was everything Warren had said and more. Andrew recognized long-lost stuffed animals and posters he'd last seen hung on the wall of the lair. The sweater his aunt had knitted him as a child hung from a hook on the wall. And he'd always wanted a canopy bed! Tonight he'd draw the curtains around the bed and tie them with pretty satin ribbons -- it was all very romantic, like an old movie.

Fingers brushed hair back from his forehead. As the moon lit the bedroom, Warren told him, ""I love you.""

And it didn't sound the way Warren had ever said it before -- not said as a means to an end, but said because they were holding each other and kissing languidly, stumbling slowly and blindly as they backed toward the bed. Warren said it as if it was a bubble of emotion bursting in his mouth.

They collapsed to the bed. ""I don't want to sleep at all tonight,"" Andrew sighed as they snuggled together. 

Warren's grin cut through the dark. ""I'm not gonna let you sleep,"" he said, his voice low and shiver-inducing.

That tone made Andrew feel all lightheaded. He relaxed into the soft down pillows and exhaled against Warren's mouth as they kissed again. Andrew wriggled in place when his shirt was pulled up and over his head. 

Warren leaned above him, dark eyes gazing downward. He smiled lovingly, and Andrew's insides took on the consistency of oatmeal. ""Happy birthday,"" Warren breathed.

And it was.

*   *   *

""How long will this last?"" Dawn asked. She held an ebony box, now containing the empty phial Willow earlier used in the spell.

Willow stared down at Andrew. He inhaled, his eyelids twitched, he exhaled, rolled over. ""All weekend. He should wake sometime Monday or Tuesday, I think. Probably really thirsty, but, uh, well-rested. As one would expect.""

Andrew gave a soft but not unhappy whimper.

Willow frowned. ""Poor guy. I didn't even know it was his birthday.""

""He'll just sleep?""

""He'll just sleep,"" confirmed Willow, ""and he'll dream.""

""I felt so bad for him,"" said Dawn, frowning. ""He had this cupcake, and just kept staring at it. I offered to take him out for frappuccinos, but he said he'd rather be alone.""

Willow relieved Dawn of the heavy box and started toward the door. ""Don't worry, Dawnie. He won't be alone.""

Title: Every Morning Comes: Part One
Author: Flannery
Rating: R
Summary: Not only does Andrew have to adjust to a new life, but he has to deal with the past coming back to haunt him.
Distribution: FCFM... anyone else? Just let me know.
Feedback: YES! Please?
Author's Notes: Spoilers for the ends of Buffy seasons six and seven, and I think there's a mention of a season two Angel episode. I didn't create these guys. I'm just using them, but they belong to Joss. So not profiting from this, either. Big thanks to everyone that's encouraged me! *snuggles her LJ friends*

*   *   *

The camera switched on, and Andrew's solemn face appeared. For a moment, the picture shook, as Andrew's hands were shaking, but once he set it on the bed, the image stilled.

His eyes fixed forward. ""I'm not scared."" A shiver in Andrew's voice betrayed him. ""I don't know why, but... I'm not.""

His pale face occupied the film for several seconds, unaccompanied by narration. He looked sullen, withdrawn. Lost. He regrouped and continued.

""He's been..."" Andrew's eyes shut, then reopened with new focus. ""This is just going to sound crazy, I -- I know. But Warren -- "" He wetted his lips. "" -- he's been around recently. My Warren. I mean -- not, not *my* Warren."" Eyes darkened. ""He's not my Warren any longer. He's... look. I'm not crazy. And -- and I'm not dreaming or imagining stuff.""

A fantastical expression crossed Andrew's face. ""I've seen him. It hurts to look right at him, like -- like looking at the sun -- "" He paused. ""No, not like that at all. It's like, like if you stare at one star for a long time, trying to watch it twinkle. And -- and your eyes start feeling strained and tired. Only with Warren, that happens after just a few seconds.""

""He's come to my room at night,"" he said, taking his time with each word in order to speak steadily. Silence descended again -- a heavy silence that even seemed to weigh on the young man in the tape. ""Warren... I -- I don't think he means me any harm. 'Cause I've read a lot of ghost stories and he isn't like a, a poltergeist, or something mean. Which is strange, 'cause I'd think of all of us, Warren would've been the one hurling lamps across the room and, and killing priests...""

Andrew sighed deeply. He rubbed his insomnia-darkened eyes.

The final line was delivered in a quivering tone. ""I think -- I think he's in pain.""

The screen went black.

*   *   *

It was September, and an ocean breeze blew from the West. Andrew's window opened to the East, but he slept with it open to catch what he could of the wind. 

Hotel rooms once held a magic for Andrew. They were symbolic of fun family vacations, an oasis of soft bed and cool air to which to return after a long day spent at a theme park or natural wonder. That wasn't to say they didn't feel magical now he was older; there was magic, sure, but it seemed a dark, sucking magic rather than pixiedust and free HBO.

The Hyperion was full of empty rooms and guarded by more spells and wards than Andrew knew, and was still as black and chilling as any other lonely structure. He was sleeping in borrowed space, wrapped in alien sheets, and truly, Andrew had felt alone.

Thus his guard had been up, the first nights of his stay. A week after the destruction of Sunnydale, his room had taken on a more lived-in appearance and had lost much of its foreign feel. He'd stuck some pictures on the walls, cut from magazines, and had clothes and books strewn about the room, all in a rather forced effort to make it His. Still, it remained a hotel room, and no amount of time or clutter was going to change that.

Andrew awoke to the room flooded with California sunshine and an unlikely birdsong from the outside. From the moment he drifted to consciousness, he became aware of a slight heavy feeling in the pit of his stomach. Andrew felt anxious, nervous, excited -- he wasn't sure which, and he couldn't figure the root of the feeling. Perhaps a remnant of a dream; something important in slumber, forgotten with sunrise...

That had happened every morning for three days now, and Andrew had yet to notice anything come of the feeling. Instead of blaming intuition, he now suspected it could be a side effect of the protection magics hovering in the air.

""It's this insistent throb,"" he told Wesley, ""like the mixing of Pop Rocks and 7-Up. And it won't go away, and... and I think it's getting worse.""

""Well, Andrew..."" Wesley frowned, thinking. ""This building was once inhabited by a demon that fed into and fed off of paranoia for more than half a century. It could simply be that you've tapped into something leftover after its demise. You're welcome to change rooms if you'd like.""

Andrew shook his head. ""No. No, I -- I think I'll stay in mine."" He thanked Wesley for the help -- Andrew always remembered to thank the others for their time.

And Fred had suggested, ""It could be some sort of residual, unconscious stress over watching a friend die."" She had such a genuine smile. Andrew loved being around her, usually, but he felt uncomfortable as she continued: ""Then, completely losing your home, and being forced to settle in a strange new place with a bunch of people you hardly know..."" 

Andrew just sighed and abandoned the subject.

Nobody believed him when he said he felt fine. For Andrew, stress hadn't been a problem. After tragedy upon tragedy had left his life in tatters, he felt happier and more fulfilled than ever before. He felt appreciated here, and had actual friends; it felt like Sunnydale was a lifetime away, like it was the twisted Oz reflection of his normal Kansas life. 

This Monday morning was unseasonably brisk. Snatching an oversized Ghostbusters sweatshirt from the floor, Andrew pulled it over his head and snuggled into the soft fabric.

Further introspection would wait for another time, because breakfast called. The others would be waking in a few hours. He wanted to have all the bowls and cereal out on the counter before the kitchen swelled with starving Slayers and Scoobies. Andrew reasoned that if he made himself useful, then perhaps Angel would want to keep him around a bit longer. It just wouldn't be right to leave so quickly after finally finding his place in the world.

*   *   *

Looking back on that day, Andrew would be able to recall the most surprising details. He had a conversation with Xander about dating shows; Kennedy cut her hair short and complained about the salon prices; he fantasized briefly about kissing Fred, before putting a firm and sudden end to the thought; Dawn wore a lovely floral sundress that floated around her legs as she walked; Lorne was miffed that nobody taped CSI Miami for him. When he looked back, the day passed in a blur, with certain moments playing out in cinematic slow motion. 

Considering this was the night of the first visit from Warren, it was strange that unimportant conversations and the like would stand out more boldly than that event.

Years after that night, Andrew recalled only what he'd committed to tape.

*   *   *

The autumn breeze was dead, effectively smothered by the heavy Los Angeles atmosphere. The window was shut and locked. Tonight, Andrew hadn't felt comfortable leaving it open. He did leave the curtains parted, for he was especially eager to catch the first rays of morning sunlight. Sunshine burnt away nightmares: the first lesson learned by a child of Sunnydale.

He was surrounded by darkness -- and not the calm, comfortable kind of darkness, but an apocalyptic darkness lit dimly by a dead orange glow from the LA streets outside.

He'd stared through the window, trying to find Orion's belt in the sky. Orion was lost behind the skyward-glare of obscene city lights.

It was 3:15 in the morning. Andrew suddenly wasn't sleeping.

In fact, he was at full consciousness, as though he'd never been asleep at all. That nagging nervousness in his gut was back and had grown to a strong, persistent thrum. Andrew felt parched for air and sucked it down like he'd been underwater.

This room that'd never felt like home felt even less so, tonight. Something about the space itself was off, in a grotesque way; it was closing in on Andrew and his skin was screaming at him to leave. He rolled over in bed and tried to fall back to sleep, but his eyes refused to shut against the potential, though insubstantial, threat.

Then:

""Hi,"" said Warren.

Andrew lurched inside his flesh. Terror assailed him, but also a sort of relief: he'd woken a number of times with Warren seated on the bed next to him, both before and after Warren's death.

Instead of a scream, instead of panic, he shut his eyes against the apparition. He screwed them shut with all his will and tried to chant away the specter with the few incantations he recalled and one or two that he made up on the spot. 

""Go away,"" he snapped when he ran out of chants. ""Just... go away!""

When he opened his eyes again, Andrew was alone.

His heart raced in the dark and everything was too, too warm all of a sudden and he couldn't swallow enough air.

The heat, the dizziness, the aches -- It's a fever. He must be getting sick. Imagining things in his half-sleep. 

The heavy thumping of his heart began to distract him. He wondered if he'd expire of a heart attack, right there in the bed. Andrew pulled the blankets over his face, burying himself in the folds of the bed. ""It wasn't... He wasn't really there,"" Andrew told himself aloud, his small voice muffled by the covers. ""Calm down. Calm *down*. Calm... Calm down.""

That wasn't real, thought Andrew, and this time he almost believed it. The First was banished. And this apparition, he realized in reflection, was wholly unlike the First. It'd been like a negative image of Warren, like a shadow against the dark. 

The room was still empty when Andrew slid the blankets from his face.

*Reversed shadow* was the description that came to mind. Wouldn't a reversed shadow be light? No, he answered himself: like the shadow that a shadow casts.

Not wanting to close his eyes, he stared out the window at the nuclear-stained sky.

Soon, exhaustion made it easier to disbelieve.

The trick of a fever. The remnant of a dream.

It was enough. There were several non-threatening explanations available, and that satisfied him. Still coccooned by layers of blankets, Andrew fell into sleep.

He dreamed of shadows.

In the Summers' house, a lovely afternoon was spent baking pre-apocalypse brownies. Suddenly...

""GYAAH!"" Xander leapt back.

""What?"" Asked Andrew, rushing to his side. Then, he shrugged and said, ""Oh, that's just the ghost.""

Xander gaped at the floating figure. ""It's a...""

""Ghost of an oven mitt,"" Andrew said, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.

The supernatural mitt gave a friendly wave.

""It suffered an unfortunate death,"" explained Andrew, ""in a macaroni fire.""

Xander shook his head. ""Tragic.""

""Very,"" agreed Andrew. He turned and addressed the ghost. ""Mitt? This is Xander. The guy I told you about.""

""The mitt knows me?""

The mitt faced Andrew. It gave him a thumbs-up.

Xander too faced Andrew, obviously confused.

Andrew just giggled.

Jonathan stared.

Andrew turned crimson.

On his hand, he wore a blue and white gingham ovenmitt. Two black button eyes were sewn onto the mitt, and a mess of dark yarn hair stuck up from the top. 

The Warrenmitt.

There was a stretch of awkward silence.

""It's -- it's mine,"" Andrew finally stated.

Warren rolled his eyes. ""I don't wanna know."" He tossed the mitt to Andrew.

When he was gone, Andrew threw the Warrenmitt at Jonathan. ""That's the last time I'm covering for you! You really need to pick that thing up when you're done using it!"""

Summary: Dawn must've read Tarot for Dummies. 
Notes: Written for the BuffySlashTarotTales list, in response to the Listmum's challenge: 100 words, mentioning both Tarot and the mitt. I didn't create these characters and take no credit for doing so. But the mitt? That is kinda my fault.

""Well?"" Andrew bounced in place. ""Which card did I draw?""

Dawn studied it and smiled. ""The Mitt card."" He moved for a glimpse, but she held it to her breast. ""You can't see. It's, uh, bad luck.""

""What does it mean?""

""Um, it means you're a very caring individual, and we all rely on you a lot to care for us,"" Dawn said. ""We're very grateful.""

Andrew beamed. ""Thanks, Dawnie. That made my morning."" He threw his arms around her, then was gone.

Exhaling slowly, Dawn glanced at the card in her hand: the Nine of Swords. 

Mitt card. 

She shook her head, still smiling.

<lj-cut text=""some Warren/Andrew angst, pre-Dead Things"">
*   *   *

He makes Andrew sick. Sometimes he just wants to lurch into the bathroom and fall to the floor and lay in a cold sweat until the feeling passes. Other times, he feels he'd like to slit his wrists and bleed himself out onto the dirty white linoleum of the bathroom floor.

Andrew likes drama. He likes watching other people squirm and thrash about in their daily lives when something goes wrong.

But he can't deal with his own drama. It's not easy for Andrew to put things into perspective. Sometimes he's able to excuse or justify difficulties as existing to further the plot. Foreshadowing to some greater disaster, maybe: the butterfly's flight that leads to the hurricane a world away.

It's been sixteen minutes since Warren stormed out and Andrew can't imagine feeling any worse. He wanted to dry heave, wail, pick up the phone and call Warren and yell and then hang up -- anything, he wanted to do anything but just sit numb in the doorway to the bathroom, scratching mildew off the base of the sink with his fingernail.

They'd fought before. Stupid things. Usually the fights were one-sided, with Warren just needing a punching bag on which to take out his anger. Not a literal punching bag, of course -- that might actually be less of a torture. Warren couldn't fight with fists and feet, but he knew how to sling words around. If he hit Andrew, it probably wouldn't even bruise the skin. But when he insulted Andrew, it cut to the bone.

""If we fail, Andrew, it'll be your goddamn fault!"" 

Andrew leaned his head back on the door frame and tried not to focus on the fight. He couldn't stop it. The words haunted him and they were all on which he had to focus.

""You're so fucking needy."" Warren had paced the room, fidgeting with some gadget in his hands. ""I should be working on plans, but I spend all my time coddling you so you don't feel like the little lame-ass loser you are. Do you see me fucking Jonathan? Do you? Jonathan doesn't need an esteem boost. Maybe I'm leaving behind the wrong person.""

The suppressed sound that came from Andrew's wet lips was like a ""meep."" That hurt. That hurt worse than Warren could've known. He knew Warren couldn't realize how much he harmed Andrew when he said such terrible things. Warren did care for him, and once when Andrew said they should break up, Warren begged him to stay.

""You're the one,"" Warren had said, choking on tears that never fell, ""You're the one I've waited my entire life to meet.""

The kind words came much more often than the negative ones. The kind gestures -- cuddling on the beanbag chairs in the lair, kissing in the back of the van, fucking slowly and quietly in Warren's bed -- all happened on a daily basis, compared to a week or more between stinging verbal attacks.

His relationship with Warren was far from healthy. This Andrew realized. No one knew -- no one could know -- the things Warren told him in the dark. The beautiful things he whispered when he was touching Andrew the way Andrew touched himself. 

""We'll fly away. To, like, London, or to Paris, some city like that, where we can just get lost in the crowds."" Warren's promises always tasted of whiskey.

""What if we're caught?"" Andrew would ask him.

And Warren would say: ""We won't get caught.""

Then Andrew would feel a stab in his belly, because Andrew was quick to panic, and he'd say this: ""What if we get killed?""

Warren stroked Andrew's hair, kissed him next to his lips and said, ""Then your name will be on my lips as I die.""

It's corny and it's not even a nice thought, but Andrew loved to hear Warren tell him things that made his heart burst. Andrew adores the cliche. It's just not as romantic if it can't be said in black and white, twenty feet high on a cinema screen.

Andrew wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. His eyes burned from watering, were raw from being rubbed. His chest felt empty, like it'd collapse under its own weight, implode into dry dust. He wanted to imagine Warren finding him here with his chest cavity caved in. Or with slit wrists. Or just crying, miserable, with pink eyes and a snotty nose and white knuckles and mildew under his fingers.

Another thing Andrew realized is this: Epic romances never end in ""happily ever after."" They end in tragic death, blood and flame, profound suffering and a broken heart that lasts forever. Warren was his first and last love; he'd condemned himself to never love again after Warren.

One leg was now numb, so Andrew sprawled out with his head in the hallway and his body across the cold bathroom floor. For a while, he might have slept, or maybe he just stared at the backs of his eyelids. Feeling miserable can exhaust a man, especially one as fragile as Andrew.

This is how he wakes: a hand on the side of his face, stroking away carpet creases on his red cheeks. Warren knelt beside him, looking down into his face, expression both concerned and regretful and also proud and indifferent.

It's going to end in tragedy, Andrew wanted to tell him. ""Hi,"" he said instead.

Title: Hitchhikers
Author: Flannery
Rating: PG
Pairing: hints of Jonathan/Andrew -- interpret it as you wish.
Disclaimer: Joss created these kids, and it was A Good Thing. The only potential profit I receive is to my ego. 
Author's Notes: I luuurve the feedback -- give it! Also, I'm pretty sure you're all caught up, but just in case, there are spoilers for the end of Season Six. This was inspired by this week's card, the Six of Swords: ""...a card symbolizing the rite of passage.  A change is coming, for better or for worse, from struggle to serenity, or vice versa.  This will occur after you come to some sort of realization about a problem or question you face.  This may be an indicator that you'll be taking some kind of journey, physically or emotionally or metaphorically.  The appearance of this card also reminds us that life works on a cycle.  What goes around comes around.""

*   *   *

Headlights slowed, focused on the two boys at the side of the road, then sped on with renewed purpose. 

""Hope you crash,"" muttered Jonathan for perhaps the tenth time that night.

Jonathan was so tired. Tired of walking, tired of running, tired of Andrew clinging to his arm like a lost child. Jonathan realizes that if he were to shrug off Andrew's grasp, the kid would probably wander out onto the empty highway or off into the endless desert.

The thought was tempting.

He'd always imagined that he'd like to be a leader, like to have people look up to him, but now that he'd been thrust into the role Jonathan decided he didn't like it at all. He didn't know where he was supposed to lead Andrew. He wasn't sure he could keep himself safe, let alone someone else. 

He hated the entire situation.

Jonathan cleared his throat. Andrew wandered on beside him, eyes straight down in a blank sort of trance.

""How're you doing, Andrew?""

Seconds of waiting. Finally, the question sunk in. ""Fine,"" answered Andrew in a raw voice.

""Look,"" said Jonathan in what he hoped sounded firm and not at all uncertain, ""we'll get through this.""

Andrew gripped his arm tighter and made a soft mewling noise.

""It's just us now,"" he said reassuringly. ""We'll get through this.""

""Just us,"" echoed Andrew.

Lights cracked the horizon. The car passed in the northbound lane.

As long as Andrew was this deep in shock, Jonathan had to try double to hold himself together. It wouldn't do to have both of them fall apart at the same time. Jonathan's grief for his lost security can wait until after they get wherever it is they're going.

The last time Andrew had uttered a complete sentence was somewhere outside Sunnydale. Safe in the cab of a freight-hauling truck, they were both able to absorb the fact that even though they'd escaped death, their lives had been all but obliterated. 

Jonathan scowled inwardly. Willow had managed to make their world explode after all. 

Andrew had slept on his shoulder as they were driven away from their home. After a brief stop in Los Angeles, the truck driver had demanded that ""the pretty blond one"" pay for the ride with his mouth. Andrew had been so out of it that he would've done it, had Jonathan not refused to allow his friend to be taken advantage of. 

When it became clear that neither would be performing illicit acts on him, he dumped the pair outside Temecula.

And after all he'd been through, Jonathan was most afraid in that moment. Witches with fireballs and evil spells -- it's kind of beyond the spectrum of believability, isn't it? But being snarled at by a large, strange man in a large, strange place with nowhere to run... that's truly frightening. Thinking back on it made Jonathan's skin crawl.

He didn't notice the car approach until it was right beside him. The driver, through a rolled-down window, asked where Jonathan was headed.

""Anywhere,"" he replied, ""anywhere you can take us.""

Jonathan took the front seat, while Andrew slipped quietly into the back.

""Are you college students?"" The driver asked.

Jonathan shook his head. Andrew was sprawled across the back-seat, staring at the car's gray ceiling; he didn't respond.

""We're, uh..."" He spent a moment thinking. ""We're off for the summer.""

""Ah,"" said the woman. ""And is he your...""

""Brother,"" answered Jonathan.

She paused for a moment, the sort of pause one indulges in when one wants to ask a question of a particularly personal nature. Then: ""Is he... all right?""

Andrew was silent. Jonathan turned and looked at him; ""He's... been through some trauma, recently.""

""Oh,"" said the woman.

""Just -- "" Jonathan choked. ""Just earlier today.""

The driver looked warily at Jonathan. ""You're not... not fugitives, are you?"" She punctuated the question with an uneasy grin that lasted only a second before fading.

""No,"" answered Jonathan. He could hear Andrew shifting in the back-seat. ""We're refugees,"" Jonathan told her.

The woman nodded silently, pondering this. She continued driving.

""War..."" came a rasp from the back-seat, ""Warren...""

It was followed by muffled, uneven breathing from a mouth pressed against a dirty sleeve.

She cleared her throat, obviously unnerved by the boy in the back-seat. ""I'm going to San Diego,"" she said. ""My sister's there, and her kids. I'm staying with them until my divorce is final.""

""I'm sorry,"" said Jonathan. He added a moment later: ""I mean, about the divorce.""

She shrugged, flashed a polite smile toward him. ""Yeah, well, it is a bit devastating, but,"" she said thoughtfully, as she was at that time surrounded by two boys much worse off in life, ""I suppose it isn't so bad."" It was time for a drastic subject change. ""Do you know where you're going?""

Jonathan answered honestly. ""No."" Then he said, ""Mexico. We're going to Mexico.""

""Well, I can take you as far as San Diego.""

""That would be great,"" said Jonathan. ""Thank you.""

She looked at Jonathan again, who was looking back at her with a warm and open expression. Being the first kind person he'd seen all night, he decided he was quite fond of the woman, and much too worn to keep up his defenses. 

""I don't normally pick up hitchhikers."" Something about her demeanor softened. ""But I couldn't just leave two -- "" Boys, she wanted to say. They looked too young to be out so late, to be out alone. "" -- two young men on the side of the road in the middle of the night.""

Jonathan didn't respond. He could feel a lump of emotion at the back of his throat and didn't want to start crying, didn't want to allow a breakdown.

""Besides,"" she said, ""it's been a long drive, and the company is nice.""

Awkward silence fell around the car. It was only broken by the rare sound of a car passing in the northbound lane, and the soft, continuous sound of Andrew's misery.

Jonathan bit his lip. ""Hey,"" he asked, ""think we can get any radio stations out here?""

""Sure. We can try."" She didn't bother trying to hide the discomfort in her voice. The driver turned the volume up so it drowned out the silent sobs from the back-seat. Every now and then, she glanced at Jonathan and he offered her a grateful smile.

Jonathan liked the desert much more from the inside of a moving vehicle. It had a sparse, black type of beauty to it: mile after mile of the same dust, the same tenacious vegetation, seen only in the path carved by the headlights. 

The stars were so bright, the land so black, that Jonathan could almost believe they were traveling through space. Suddenly, a thought struck him, and he smiled.

""Hey Andrew,"" he said gently, turning in his seat. ""Did you remember your towel?""

It was hard to see Andrew in the shroud of darkness. A car passed, and illuminated the shiny wet streaks on Andrew's face. Jonathan could see that Andrew was weakly smiling at him. ""I've been thinking..."" Andrew spoke barely above a whisper, as if he was afraid his voice would carry back to Sunnydale. ""...and I think... I think things're gonna be fine,"" he said.

Jonathan relaxed back into his seat. ""Yeah, Andrew."" He gazed out at the black sky, the Pollock-splatter of the stars. ""Things are gonna be fine.""

*   *   *

The house had been in chaos. Nothing escaped the Potentials' teenage fury, and Xander had needed to repair, replace or readjust one thing after another. It was a never-ending hell of hormones and broken appliances, windows shattered during Slayer training, and so on. Then the Bringers came and did real damage, meaning Xander had to work his ass off through the twenty hours a day he wasn't sleeping. 

And to top it all off, there was Andrew flitting about him, like a mosquito with a video camera.

To tell the truth, Xander didn't so much mind Andrew when he was calm. He was another male presence in the house, and Xander was thankful for that. They had things in common. He was easy to talk to, when he wasn't mooning over Spike or Anya (depending on which team the boy played for -- Xander simply couldn't decide). Andrew didn't condescend to him like Giles and he wasn't too busy or stressed to talk as were Buffy and Willow, and sometimes Andrew was perfectly happy to sit and read comics with Xander and not say a word.

Xander relished his quiet time.

Like now. He rolled over in bed and looked at the clock: 1:32 in the afternoon. He smiled and stretched, tangling his bare arms and legs in the sheets. It was like heaven, sleeping in -- no girls, no Slayer, no vampire or Watcher or anything. Just Xander, and the soft bed that smelled like Willow's shampoo, and an entire day to do nothing but soak up the peace.

It crept under the door like fog, slowly rising and filling the room. Xander sniffed the air; his eyes rolled back and a slow smile spread over his face. Okay, he decided, so he wasn't as alone as he'd thought, but whoever he wasn't alone with was baking something divine.

If he'd been in a cartoon, Xander would have been floating through the air nose-first as he followed the glorious scent down the stairs.

The entire house had become a cookie-scented paradise. Sweet, warm, comforting baking smells: the classic sugar cookie, perhaps? Or was it a hearty oatmeal? No, he decided as he grew closer -- the smell was slightly spicy. 

Xander was virtually in a trance as he appeared in the kitchen. Nothing was broken, spilled or burning, noted Xander with relief, but the countertop was covered in baking ingredients. Standing in front of the oven, holding a tray, was Andrew. 

""Hi, Xander!"" And so the mystery was put to rest: ""Ginger cookies,"" Andrew said with a proud smile. ""I really hope you like ginger.""

Xander nodded. His mouth was watering. ""Ginger, yeah. You made these?"" Dumb question. He added, ""They smell amazing.""

He colored slightly and set the cookies down. ""You're always so sweet, Xander,"" Andrew said, tilting his head in a rather fetching manner. ""Are you hungry? I thought you'd sleep all day. Not that I'm at all surprised, by the way you've been working around here. If you're not careful, you'll wear yourself out.""

""Well,"" shrugged Xander, ""stuff has to be done.""

""Yes,"" said Andrew, ""yes it does. Xander -- "" Xander liked the way Andrew said his name, drawing out the last syllable and letting it roll off his tongue -- ""You've got to be starving by now. Please let me make you something.""

He shook his head. ""I ate this morning, when everyone left. Had to be up to help with cooking."" Xander nodded his head toward the recycle bin, which was filled to the brim with empty Eggo boxes.

""Oh. I was still sleeping,"" said Andrew. ""Except, Giles stepped on me when he got out of bed, and then he swore a lot. That kinda woke me up."" He gave a small grin, and Xander couldn't help but smile back. 

""And then you just decided, oh, what the world needs now is cookies?"" Xander asked.

Andrew shifted his weight from foot to foot, chewed his lip in the way he did when he was feeling hedgey. ""Something like that,"" he confirmed.

Yes, there was some hedging happening. Whatever. Xander didn't really care <i>why</i> there were cookies, just that there <i>were</i> cookies.

Andrew hunched over the countertop and inspected the batch. He looked up when Xander joined him. ""They didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped,"" he said mournfully. ""They're all a bit... blobby, aren't they?""

Row after row of amoeba-shaped cookies. Two appeared to have merged in baking, looking especially macabre.

""Just a little bit blobby,"" Xander reassured him. ""And who cares how they look? So long as they taste -- "" He went to pick up a misshapen cookie.

""Don't touch!"" Squealed Andrew.

The warning came too late. Xander yelped in pain and jammed his burnt fingers in his mouth. 

""Ooh, Xander!"" Andrew scolded, mitted hands on hips. ""What were you thinking? You just watched me take those out of the oven!""

""Mmf,"" he whined pathetically in response.

Andrew frowned. He removed one of the oven mitts from his hand and gently took hold of Xander's arm, pulling the burnt hand toward the sink. ""Here. You... you need to run some cold water on that.""

""It's okay."" The fingers were turning pink under the water. ""It isn't that bad. It hardly even hurts anymore.""

""I'm sorry, Xander,"" said Andrew, lower lip protruding. ""Here... here I tried to do something nice for you, 'cause you've been working so hard, with the... with the Bringers tearing up the, the house and all...""

""You made these for me?""

""...and, and I end up hurting you with my lousy cookies."" He gave a pause. ""Yes,"" he admitted, ""I made them for you.""

Xander was somewhat amazed that Andrew had gone through all this work for him -- he could count on his burnt fingers the number of times they'd had actual bond-worthy conversations. Definitely pleased, though. He smiled warmly at Andrew and, oddly, felt his cheeks coloring. ""That's really nice of you.""

""I expected them to turn out better,"" mumbled the blond as he poked at a blob of dough with his spatula. ""I worked on the shapes all morning.""

Xander stared at the tray. Were they <i>supposed</i> to be amoebas?

""If you look closely,"" Andrew gestured at the amoebas, and Xander looked closely as instructed, ""you will notice that the cookies are in the shapes of tools."" As he spoke, the rhythm of his words became more halting and less confident. 

Oh. Now that he squinted at them, they did slightly resemble blobby little hammers and saws.

""I don't know what to say. Except thanks, of course."" Xander smiled at him, and the other man blushed and bashfully ran a hand through his hair. 

""Yeah, well, it was nothing,"" giggled Andrew. He watched as Xander shook droplets of water from his injured hand. ""How is it?"" He asked.

""How's what?""

Andrew gestured at the other man's hand.

""Damp,"" answered Xander.

""Blistering?""

Xander grinned. ""It was just a cookie, not boiling oil.""

""Oh,"" said Andrew, ""right."" He stood awkwardly for a moment, then held out his mitted hand. ""You can dry your hand on my mitt if you like.""

Right, thought Xander. Or he could just get a fresh towel out of the linen closet. Not wanting to hurt Andrew's feelings after all the trouble he went through, Xander placed his wet hand on Andrew's mitt. ""Heh. It's warm,"" he said, feeling rather silly.

Andrew grasped Xander's hand in his. It seemed to Xander that they were standing unnecessarily close to each other... but it was a small kitchen, he rationalized, and it wasn't like there was anything wrong with what they were doing.

And just what, said a voice in the back of his mind, is it that you are doing? Even to himself, Xander had to admit that he didn't know. Nothing, he tried to say, I'm doing nothing and Andrew doesn't mean anything by all these little gestures. It's a big nothing that's happening.

Andrew took a sudden step forward, nervousness and resolve written all over his face. He was still grasping Xander's hand in the thick quilted oven mitt. Xander wanted to say something, maybe about his hand no longer hurting or the kitchen floor needing a sweep, but what he managed was, "" 's a nice oven glove,"" followed by a juvenile chuckle. Then, he was going to say something self-deprecating about what a dumb thing he'd just said, but instead: ""Bet you never burn your fingers wearing that.""

""You're all red,"" observed Andrew. 

He released Xander's hand, and brushed the mitt over Xander's cheek. It was warm still from handling the tray, and caused Xander to give a happy purr deep in his throat. Surprised at his reaction, Xander gave an embarrassed giggle. ""That's, uh, nice,"" he offered as explanation.

""Mmm."" Andrew smiled in agreement. His mitted hand cupped Xander's jaw, then slid down the side of his neck.

Xander sighed and let his head fall back. ""Smells good too."" Like ginger cookies and something uniquely Andrew.

He couldn't recall when his mouth had gone so dry. His tongue was like heavy cotton in his mouth and when he licked his lips, he found it didn't make a difference.

Neither could he recall when his eyes had fallen shut. The mitt shifted over his skin to the back of his neck, and Xander suddenly felt Andrew's moist lips on his. At first the kiss was tentative, a bit hesitant, as if despite the sensuality between them, Andrew wasn't certain of Xander's feelings. But when Xander's mouth opened against his, Andrew fell into the kiss with fury.

It was at once wet and passionate and caused the rest of the world to melt around him. Xander wouldn't have ever imagined a kiss from Andrew would be so brilliant -- not, that is to say, that he'd given much thought to kissing Andrew. Truth be told (because one had to be brutally truthful with oneself when another man's tongue was in one's mouth and one was finding oneself irrationally aroused by a soft, warm oven mitt), he had thought about Andrew like that, once or twice, but it was more a cuddly and unsure type of fantasy, rather than with the kissing and the tongue and...

...and Andrew's free hand was hooked into the waistband of his jeans, while the mitt rested against Xander's stomach. Stroking in oblong circles, Xander's muscles contracting beneath the insulated, quilted fluff, as Xander moaned into Andrew's talented mouth. His brain was having trouble keeping up; there was still an element of disbelief that this was Andrew -- cute, geeky Andrew -- molesting him in the kitchen of the Summers house and that he -- handsome and usually straight Xander -- was immensely enjoying said molestation.

Andrew pulled back a fraction and glanced up at Xander. Andrew's cheeks were red and his eyes glossy, and his mouth -- Xander almost found himself groaning as he stared at Andrew's mouth -- was flushed with blood and swollen from exertion, glazed with saliva. Unable to help himself, he dove back at that beautiful mouth. He knotted his hands in Andrew's shirt and pulled; thrown off balance, Andrew mewled softly and crashed against Xander, and Xander in turn crashed against the oven. 

This kiss was even harder than the last. Things were progressing rapidly and Xander found he didn't feel uneasy, didn't at all want to stop. Against the back of his thighs, the oven was still warm, the inviting scent of ginger thick in the air around them. Andrew's bare hand was unfastening Xander's jeans and trying to push them off, unsuccessfully. Andrew went to remove the mitt, but Xander's hand closed around his wrist. ""Leave it on,"" he said breathlessly, eyes boring into Andrew's.

Mutely, Andrew nodded, then a slow smile parted his face. 

Jeans pooled around Xander's feet, underpants somewhere about his lower thighs. Andrew was teasing, still slowly petting his torso with the mitted hand, barely brushing the cloth against Xander's skin.

""Gahhhd,"" panted Xander. His eyes were shut, but he heard Andrew's soft responding giggle.

And then, without any sort of warning, Andrew wrapped his mitt around Xander's cock and gave a firm stroke. The feeling was warm, terribly warm and cotton-dry, and Xander tried to say it was too uncomfortable but only managed to make some sort of soggy gasping noise.

Once again Xander found himself grasping Andrew's wrist, holding it still and causing Andrew to look up at him with a puzzled expression. 

""Change of plans, Andrew. Mitt off,"" he ordered.

Andrew obeyed, but looked rather flustered. ""Was that... I mean, didn't you...""

He really didn't want to say that it felt like, well, like fucking an oven mitt, so instead Xander told him, ""I'd rather feel your hand on me, that's all.""

""Oh."" Andrew blushed, but smiled.

Xander realized he adored Andrew's smile.

Then his hand was back on Xander's cock, bare this time, skin-on-skin. Xander released a yowl and subsequently bit down on his lip, censoring himself for an empty house. One arm wrapped around Andrew's waist, and he dug dull fingernails into the cloth-covered back. The other hand was clutching the edge of the stove behind him, bracing him from falling forward -- or from Andrew laying him across the range-top.

""Good?"" The word was warm and wet against Xander's ear and punctuated by a swipe from Andrew's tongue. Xander didn't answer, and Andrew didn't need him to.

At first the strokes were slow and almost reverent, and Xander's head fell back as Andrew touched him. Fingertips skated over the skin of his cock until Xander was nearly mad with anticipation; he writhed against Andrew's body, moaned into the side of his hair. 

Soon, the too-light touches had moved away to his hips, then his upper thighs, over his soft stomach, and Xander was begging in soft whimpers for more. He had pulled up Andrew's shirt and was rubbing his skinny back, whispering dirty promises if only Andrew would touch him, ""No not there,"" gasped Xander, ""You know where I -- ""

Then Andrew sunk to his knees on the linoleum floor. As Xander's eyes followed him down, he was vaguely aware of the oven mitt crumpled on the floor beside him. Eyes foggy blue with desire, Andrew briefly returned Xander's look and then plunged downward. 

""Shit, Andrew!"" Xander hissed through clenched teeth. A defenseless cookie met its demise under his elbow as he leaned backward, no longer able to support his complete weight. The pleasure spreading through his lower half and up throughout the rest of him was rendering his flesh to pudding. 

Xander's mouth gaped soundlessly. His hips bucked forward, but Andrew held firm; his fingers would leave faint bruises on Xander's skin. He'd swallowed Xander's cock completely -- didn't this boy have a natural gag reflex? -- and worked it with a proficiency Xander had never imagined would exist. Especially not in Andrew, innocent little Andrew with the comic books and zip-up hoodies...

Innocent little Andrew swallowed him again and this time, Xander cried out in pleasure. He could feel warm breath from Andrew's nose against his skin, buried in the dark pubic curls. For a moment, he let his mouth slide from Xander's cock. He smiled wickedly up at Xander, lips slick and chin wet, before plunging downward again. 

That look, Xander reflected, it had to have been that look that finished him off. Warmth, intense and glorious, radiated through Xander as he climaxed. His eyes shut tightly. He couldn't stop himself from shouting (stars, he thought, I'm actually seeing stars) and gasping out Andrew's name as he came hard, thrusting a bit too roughly into Andrew's small mouth. It was spectacular and quickly over, and Xander felt almost disconnected as he slid down to the floor beside Andrew.

The other man was coughing softly. His seductive persona had faltered as Xander came in his mouth -- he'd unceremoniously choked and had been trying to hide his sporadic coughing. He grabbed the oven mitt off the floor and wiped his glistening mouth on its back.

Desperate to maintain a fraction of modesty, Xander tugged up his boxers. ""That was...""

Andrew coughed, then grinned. ""Yeah. That was.""

""Uh."" He gestured loosely at the lump in Andrew's jeans. ""You want me to...""

Andrew shook his head. ""No. No, you don't have to. I mean... yeah, it would be nice, but...""

Xander cut him off, placing a finger to Andrew's swollen red lips. ""Did Giles fold up the sofa in the den this morning?""

""No,"" Andrew said, ""he left really early and I was still asleep. Um, after I got stepped on. He couldn't fold it up with me in the way.""

""Good."" Xander threaded his fingers through Andrew's hair. ""Then that's less work for us. Go in there and wait for me?"" He tugged Andrew's face close and gave him a lingering kiss. ""I'll be just a minute.""

Breathlessly, Andrew nodded. The action was over, and it seemed incredulity (and Andrew's natural insecurity) was starting to sink in. ""Oh... okay...""

""I'll be right in,"" Xander said, teasingly giving Andrew's thigh a firm stroke. ""And you might want to be naked,"" he added.

As Andrew was leaving (with a new bounce to his step, Xander noted), Xander popped a cookie in his mouth. Tasty, if a bit sugary. Having seen the way Andrew fixed his iced tea, the overpowering sweetness didn't at all surprise him. It was soft and moist and left a pleasant ginger-burn at the back of his throat.

He heard Andrew unzipping his jeans from the other room, and Xander began gathering up his shed clothes. Didn't want to forget to do it later, if he and Andrew were busy the rest of the day. He glanced around, making certain he was alone. Then, quickly, snatched up the oven mitt from the floor. It would be stuffed into his overnight bag before he joined Andrew in the den.

"event","Look. I'd like to get something out of the way: I cannot write Giles. I write the sort of Giles that, if you squint and look at him in dim light, sort of resembles the right Giles. Just so you know.

Takes place in season seven, but there aren't any spoilers. This involves more stuff stolen from Lovecraft, along with some gruesomely (and intentionally) over-the-top writing. Seriously. I sling adjectives like hotcakes. (Does one sling hotcakes? I think so. Sounds right.)

It hasn't any title. And I may have to change it at some point -- it sort of dies toward the end and doesn't have a satisfactory finish. But anyway. Feedback is welcome <i>and</i> adored.

<lj-cut text=""Ficcage: In which Giles has something Andrew wants, in a non-porny way."">
*   *   *

On tiptoes, he entered the Watcher's room with greatest stealth. This was a storage room converted for sleeping: cardboard boxes were carefully piled in a corner and along the walls, stacked double-high to make room for the small cot on which Giles slept. Boxes at the foot of the cot, four in length, formed a makeshift shelf spread with personal items.

What the intruder wanted wasn't displayed among the toiletries and notebooks, however. He knew exactly where his quarry lay: Giles kept it under the thin mattress like pornography. Kneeling next to the cot, he groped about until finally, he grasped what he'd been seeking.

It didn't feel as iniquitous as he'd been expecting. Andrew leaned back on his haunches, admiring the book he held in the dim light from the hallway. He'd expected a more ornate cover, or perhaps fancier script; but this must be a copy, he thought, as it seemed well-bound and somehow more modern but no less nefarious. Though it may have been a copy, it was spectacularly rare. Such a wicked tome would never be mass printed, and the few copies in existence rest under strict security in athanaeum scattered over the continents.

Before Warren had come along and altered Andrew's future in exchange for true love, Andrew had planned on attending the infamous Miskatonic University at Arkham. He belived it was the closest he'd ever get to the legendary codex. Until, that is, he'd become familiar with Mr. Giles and his vast collection of the obscene and dreadful volumes Andrew had only dreamt about in his most villainous moments.

He cracked the book open. <i>The Necronomican of A. Alhazrad granted to Rupert Giles on authority of The Watchers Council</i> was printed in plain type on the blank first page. Andrew's jaw went slack -- Giles had his own <i>personal</i> copy. It wasn't simply a rare reproduction. It was a gift.

There wasn't any reason he should've been surprised. Afterall Giles was the Watcher to the Slayer --

""Andrew,"" a low voice growled from the doorway. ""Get your hands off that damned book.""

The young man sprung to his feet with the look of a puppy caught chewing the furniture. He cracked a sheepish smile. ""I, uh, I guess you could mean that literally,"" he said uneasily, ""as it is a <i>damned</i> book..."" Obediantly, he set the foul tome atop the box nearest the bed.

""Out,"" Giles ordered.

Andrew chanced a look at his eyes. They were hard, and chilled the younger man so that he dropped his gaze and nervously shuffled past the Watcher. 

Though his curiosity was great, Andrew's will to live was greater. There would not be another attempt at the Necronomicon, though this venture had brought him closer than the twice he'd tried before. This time he'd held it, opened it, slipped his fingers over one of the most arcane books of mad sorcery ever put to creation.

However he knew -- and he hadn't any doubt of it -- that Giles would sooner burn out Andrew's eyes than ever let him look upon those profane pages. Andrew would rather live with his lifelong curiosity, one that bordered even on obsession, than again risk the Watcher's wrath. 

This he had already decided when Giles placed a warm hand on his shoulder. Andrew looked somewhere past him when he turned, ashamed still and more than a little frightened, and muttered a tentative apology.

Giles spoke slowly, his voice carrying an unfamiliar rasp. ""Andrew. You can't... I don't ever want you to touch that book again. Understood? Not mine, not any you may one day come across.""

Reluctant to promise such a thing, Andrew hesitated.

""It... it isn't that I don't trust such information in your hands or even that I consider you too naive."" Giles now took on an almost pleading tone. When his eyes again met Andrew's, they were shimmering with repressed emotion. ""If I could go back... if I could do it again... Andrew, I would <i>never</i> have allowed myself to read the terrible things in that book.""

Head tilted floorward, Giles murmured, ""Don't make my mistake,"" as somberly he treaded back to his room.

It was nearly impossible for Andrew to reconcile that image, of Giles looking mournful and twice as old, with the fierce black-eyed individual that'd moments earlier ordered the cursed volume from his hands.

First time I knew something was wrong, I was eight. It was a family trip to Disneyland, and I was walking down an Anaheim street with my mother on one side and little Andrew bounding several steps ahead. It was night; not really late, but later than I usually saw at that age. The sounds of the city seemed muted and there were few people about when it happened.

Suddenly I was walking through a world that could've been a dream; that is to say, my head swam with an influx of reality and my small self couldn't be sure I wasn't simply dreaming of walking down a street in Anaheim, my mother next to me, my little brother making a concerted effort not to step on sidewalk cracks. The world around me felt ricepaper thin, like it could collapse at any time and bleed into the next fragile world, and I tried to wrap my eight-year-old mind around the idea of a violently sudden nonexistance.

It was so heavy that I was nearly gasping for air under the weight of confusion and panic. My stride slowed but I didn't cry out. Fallen behind, I watched Andrew's small body darting up and down the sidewalk, joyously holding up something he'd found in the gutter, and mother taking his wrist and saying to drop it and that he must wash his hands the very moment he enters the hotel room. Before my eyes it played out like the memory of a television show."

Title: The Call of Cthandrhu (part 3)
Author: Flannery
Rating: PG-13
Disclaimer: Andrew, Tucker, and a few others are borrowed from the Buffyverse, which I neither created nor own. Anything else remotely interesting, including Miskatonic University and the entire city of Arkham, belongs to the godlike Mr Lovecraft.

Notes: I don't think Jonathan is a little goblin; that is Tucker's opinion. <a href=""http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=1373658"">Previous parts can be found here.</a> And finally, feed me. I mean, feedback me. I'll feed myself once I post this.

<lj-cut text=""*   *   *"">

""Did you get to see the Leng exhibit?""

Andrew nodded and swallowed another spoonful of warm white mush.

Dinner was courtesy of Colonel Sanders that night. Tucker had brought home Andrew's favorite: a large container of mashed faux-tatoes, plain, no gravy. (""You know that has absolutely no nutritional content, don't you?"" Tucker had admonished.) After spending half the day with Zillah, he'd been looking forward to a little brotherly interaction, but Andrew had been mostly quiet and withdrawn.

""Those photographs of Antarctica,"" Tucker said conversationally, ""can only be seen in the museum. There's a condition that they not be widely published; in fact, they're usually put away in the vault, but you lucked out by visiting at -- "" His brother didn't seem to be listening, so Tucker stopped talking and concentrated on eating.

Five minutes later, Andrew mused absently, ""Someone should start a mashed potato delivery service.""

""Yeah,"" said Tucker. It was one of the dumbest ideas he'd ever heard, but he'd rather have inane-chatter Andrew than quietly-thoughtful Andrew. And so he agreed, hoping his little brother would continue and say something else. He didn't, and the meal lapsed into silence once again.

And again, it was Andrew who broke that silence, minutes later. ""Do you know Ms Haelstrom? In the museum?""

""Haelstrom?"" Tucker swallowed his macaroni. ""Yeah. The Haelstrom family has donated a load of Dark Arts books to the library. A few have wound up in the vault, even. I think there's always been one of them on staff. Watching the family artifacts, taking advantage of faculty perks, that kinda stuff.""

""Oh."" At his brother's curious look, Andrew began rummaging in his pocket. ""She, uh... I spoke with her earlier, in the museum? And --"" He pulled the note out, "" -- she wrote that I... am granted... access... to..."" Andrew trailed off as he studied the note. He'd wager his life-sized cardboard Xena that the note hadn't said that earlier.

""Access to...?"" prompted Tucker.

""A, uh... it's permission to borrow Haven Haelstrom's journal from the library,"" Andrew replied, trying to mask the confusion in his voice. He tried to sound as if that's what he'd meant to say, instead of just reading it for the first time.

""Seriously?"" Tucker snatched the note from his hand and read it. ""Wow,"" he muttered in conclusion. ""Pretty impressive, Drew. What'd you have to do to convince her?"" He raised an eyebrow and smirked at his brother.

""Oh, I just -- Tucker! Gross!"" Andrew swatted at Tucker, then grabbed the note away from the snickering boy. ""For your information, I just *asked*. Nicely.""

Tucker nodded in consideration. ""I should try that. Maybe then they'll let me check out Extradimensional Teleportation for Dummies.""

By now, Andrew was scraping the bottom of his styrofoam container for the last bits of delightfully bland faux-tato. ""So,"" he jammed the last spoonful of mush in his mouth, ""what'd you and Zillah do today?""

Tucker blushed. ""We... uh, summoned things, and... runes...""

""I thought you had an essay?"" asked Andrew unsurely.

""That's what I meant,"" Tucker said, barely batting an eye. ""An essay. On... runes.""

Andrew nodded thoughtfully, then said, ""I'm not too good with runes. My friend Jonathan, though, he's pretty good with them."" 

With a snort, Tucker rolled his eyes. ""You're still hanging out with that little poseur?""

""Yeah,"" he replied in a small voice. ""Jonathan's okay.""

""Drew, even Warren's better than that little goblin. I can't believe -- ""

Sharply, Andrew changed the subject. ""How long have you and Zillah been together?""

""A while,"" shrugged Tucker. ""Couple months.""

""And..."" He tried to think up suitable questions to ask; anything to keep Tucker from criticizing his choice in friends. ""Uh, how'd you meet?""

A wistful smile crossed Tucker's face. ""We met at a student art exhibit. She was morose because her piece had to be removed -- it was attracting flies, you see...""

Andrew shuddered inwardly.

""I said I was sorry over the loss of her project, and we got to talking. Well, when I mentioned I was from Sunnydale, we both really clicked, and ended up talking until dawn.""

""How romantic,"" muttered Andrew. He'd be happier for his brother if Zillah hadn't been an evil toad-woman. Surely he couldn've done better.

Tucker shook his head, detecting his brother's sarcasm. ""I really don't see how you don't like her. You two have a lot in common, actually.""

""I don't not like her!"" protested Andrew. He hoped he sounded sincere.

""But you don't *like* her, Drew.""

""Do I have to?"" whined Andrew. ""I mean, you don't need my approval or anything.""

Tucker frowned. He'd been twirling his fork in his fingers somewhat nervously, and now placed it down on the table. ""Andrew,"" he'd taken on that older brother tone that made Andrew wince every time, ""you can't dislike Zillah just because she scares you. She may be different, but she's really nice, once you get to know her."" After letting that sink in for a moment, Tucker added, ""Besides. Women usually scare you.""

""Only when they're descended from giant frogs,"" Andrew shot back. He regretted it as soon as he'd said it, and regretted it even more when he saw Tucker's eyes narrow and his jaw clench.

""I thought you'd matured enough that I could have an adult conversation with you."" He'd risen from his seat and was stiffly clearing leftover dinner trash from the small table.

Andrew rose from the table as well. ""I'm... I'm going to get that book now,"" he said awkwardly. 

Tucker responded with a curt nod. ""Don't be out too late.""

""Won't,"" muttered Andrew.

*   *   *

The library was empty, which surprised Andrew. He'd expected it should be full of students -- isn't that what college was about? Evenings spent with your nose in a book?

A man at the main desk looked up expectantly as Andrew approached. ""It's so empty. Where is everyone?""

The man stared a moment, looking bored. He then asked, ""What do you need?""

Andrew handed the post-it from his pocket to the man, who looked it over intently. He mused for a moment, then pocketed the slip. ""Normally you wouldn't be able to do this. All checkouts require a student ID.""

""Oh,"" said Andrew, ""That's -- ""

""Can't really control what Hepzibah does with her own books. If she thinks some kid..."" The muttering faded as he walked away, post-it in hand.

Andrew was left alone as the man vanished into a back room. It was ten minutes before he came back, and with him, he carried a thin leather-bound book. ""Here it is. Take care of it -- I guess that goes without saying. If Haelstrom trusts you enough to take the journals, I'm not one to say different.""

The book was light and the leather covering it was peeled and worn in places. It looked as if it once had a latch over the pages, which had at some point fallen off. Andrew opened it, gazing reverently: Haven Haelstrom, the inside cover read in ancient, faded ink, March 1792. Andrew closed it and held it tightly against his chest. 

""Thanks,"" he said, turning to leave. Holding the book, he felt like he'd been transported to a different world. All Andrew wanted was to get back to Tucker's dorm so he could start reading. 

Andrew paused in realization.

Actually, all Andrew wanted was to get back to Tucker's room, period. With only a vague idea of the way, it'd be a miracle if he got back.

As he walked away, he could hear the old man call after him: ""You'll wanna be careful what you read... there's no such thing as unlearning, you know.""

*   *   *

Hours had passed. Tucker wondered how his brother was doing. He felt a pang of guilt leaving Andrew yet again that day. He was supposed to be spending time with his little brother, but he'd been spending it all with Zillah. As if he couldn't see her every other day.

Tucker had been close to Andrew before he'd left for college. The boys were close in age and shared many interests, including demon summoning. When the Slayer thwarted his attack on the school prom, Tucker was comforted by a similarly dateless Andrew. When Holden Webster kissed Andrew backstage during Drama Club, it was his older brother that heard all about it. 

Yawning, Zillah finished her chant and tossed the remaining shred of evil ingredient into the flame. ""Done,"" she said, wiping her dirty hands on her jeans. It'd been a particularly complex spell to cast, and had taken hours. She was finding it hard to keep the look of extreme pride off her gray little face.

""That was it?"" Tucker looked disappointed. He'd been expecting elaborate explosions, a show of colored lights, maybe the screams of damned souls...

Zillah quirked an eyebrow. ""For living on the Hellmouth, you have had very little contact with actual magicks.""

""What little I've had,"" snorted Tucker, ""looked less like Martha Stewart Living and more like -- ""

""Siegfried and Roy?""

With an exasperated sigh, he snatched his jacket from the back of his chair. ""Sure, Z. Lycra jumpsuits and all.""

She frowned in his direction. ""Where are you going?""

""It's..."" Tucker checked his watch. ""...2:03 in the morning. I'm going back to my room for sleep."" As he pulled his jacket on, he said, his voice tinged with guilt, ""Besides, I want to make sure Andrew got back safely.""

""Of course he did,"" she said flippantly.

Irately, he replied, ""Adding prophecy to your resume now?""

Tension swarmed around them like gnats, only with more metaphor. During their time together, the couple had bickered occasionally, but this was different. Tucker had always been with her completely when it came to their spells; now this was the most important ritual of Zillah's life so far, and he'd behaved as if they were simply summoning Pringles from the 7-11.

Turning away, he uttered, ""Night, Z.""

""Night, Tucker,"" she growled through sharp, clenched teeth.

Two nights left. Tucker had better stop screwing around like some weekend warlock. She'd been relying on his help with this summoning and knew there wasn't any way she could pull it off without him. If tomorrow didn't go well, Zillah was going to be his worst nightmare.

Literally.

Absently picking a bit of dead animal flesh from under her nail, she mused that Tucker had been correct about one thing: the mixture did not end with ingredients stewing in a fiery cauldron like Chicken 'N' Stars from Hell. 

Heard by no earthly ears, Zillah chanted words contained only in the vault of Miskatonic's library.

Clouds converged over Arkham, and split open in a sudden downpour.

*   *   *

The room seemed exceptionally dark as Tucker entered. He couldn't place what was different at first; then, noticed that every electrical light source -- even the blinking digital 12:00 on the VCR -- was dark and the only light came gray through the closed curtains.

""Andrew?"" He called, squinting against the black.

Had there been a power outage? Surely not, as the entire building would then be out. And where the devil was his brother? Tucker frowned, worried. He'd been with Zillah all night. He felt neglectful. He was a very bad brother, and a very bad human being.

A weak voice came from the bed. ""Tucker?""

Tucker exhaled a sigh of relief. ""Andrew... Andrew, what happened? You feeling okay?""

""I don't think so."" Andrew's small voice shook. ""I feel all cold. And, and dizzy."" The boy crawled into his big brother's arms as Tucker sank down on the bed next to him. ""I had a headache. The light made it worse.""

Tucker stroked his brother's hair, letting his palm linger on Andrew's forehead. ""You're all clammy,"" he said, barely whispering so as not to worsen Andrew's headache. ""Lay back down. I'll get you some Advil, but I'm gonna have to turn on the light.""

A messy blond head pressed itself into the pillow, whining in a most Andrewish way. When Tucker flipped the main light on, he could see his brother more clearly: body curled under the blankets, fists clutching the pillow, smothering his face from the brightness. Shit, thought Tucker. He left Andrew alone for a few hours, and the boy wound up with the flu. Mom was going to kill him.

With as little noise as was possible, Tucker fetched a glass of water and bottle of painkillers for his brother. He saw Andrew's grip on the pillow had lessened and thought he may have fallen asleep.

""Drew..."" He laid a hand on Andrew's shoulder. ""I have, uh...""

Tucker trailed off as his brother raised his head. The skin of his face was devoid of color and abnormally tight. Eyes that were usually playful and blue appeared to be opaque pools of black, ringed by bruise-colored shadows.

""Tucker?""

He quickly looked away, thrusting the glass of water and pills at Andrew. ""Here. I'll sleep on the couch. If... If you need anything...""

Xander never considered himself gay.

Not even bisexual. See, the way he thought about it, a person could drink the occasional beer without being an alcoholic. Likewise, a man could occasionally have lusty thoughts about another man and not be a homosexual.

On his lap, Andrew wriggled a little, which derailed his train of thought. ""My leg's asleep,"" Andrew complained, but when he turned his face, it was still plastered with a contented smile.

He stilled again, once he'd found a comfortable position: shirtless back crooked against Xander's front, one long thigh extended over the arm of the chair, the other resting between Xander's denim-clad legs. When Andrew tilted his head back, Xander was able to place an awkwardly positioned kiss at the corner of his mouth.

Xander slid his hand over Andrew's flat chest, so skinny it was nearly concave. It occurred to him, as his palm caressed the stiffening nipple underneath, that girls and their curves were overrated."

Spike looked over their new hostage, bound with strong ropes to a chair. Smirking, he asked, ""Xander's work?""

Andrew just nodded back, curiously. And a bit frightened, admittedly; Spike's presence made him squirmy ever since the biting incident.

""Xander's big with the bondage."" The vampire crossed his arms over his chest as he spoke. ""Kept tyin' me to a chair every night for a week when I stayed with him. I couldn't hurt 'im or anything, he had no reason to keep me bound -- he just <i>likes</i> it.""

The chair shook slightly as Andrew snorted out a laugh. ""Silly vampire. Why would anyone <i>like</i> tying -- "" He blushed suddenly under Spike's gaze. ""Oh, you mean he <i>really</i>, uh, liked it. Like, like he really liked Anya.""

Spike chuckled and shook his head. He couldn't believe someone could be so naive as Andrew. ""Yes. Exactly.""

And so the figurtive light bulb luminesced above Andrew's messy blond head.

Next time Xander came to tie him up, he decided he'd play along. Andrew would put up a little struggle, with thrashing and whimpering, pouting and panting. Xander would have to get rough; forcibly hold Andrew down while knotting the rope. Pin him to the chair. Maybe straddle him...

As Spike walked away, he wondered why the kid was smiling so wickedly."

Title: The Call of Cthandrhu (part 2)
Author: Flannery
Rating: PG-13
Disclaimer: Tucker, Andrew and any other mentions of Buffy characters belong to Joss, Fox and other powerful entities. Miskatonic University, the nasty water, and so on belong to the late Mr. Lovecraft.
Notes: Tucker's a bit strange, but I don't think he's as sadistic as people seem to think. Takes place circa Buffy season five -- Tucker's quite settled into college life, and Andrew is about 17.

*   *   *

Early summer, a warm New England night.

The couch was killing his back.

Andrew watched the VCR blink a digital twelve o'clock. Musing, he decided he was much like that clock: good-for-nothing much of the time, but correct twice a day.

Tucker had no roommate, nor a spare bed. Andrew spent two hours uncomfortably curled up on the worn couch before crawling into the small bed his brother occupied. The other man had simply groaned in his sleep and made room, just as he'd done when Andrew had been a child.

*   *   *

""I'm not having fun,"" Andrew whined as he pulled his socks on.

There was a pause in the brushing noises. ""What was that?""

""Nothing,"" he called back, pouting to himself.

A moment later, the running water in the bathroom stopped. Andrew heard his brother spit out a mouthful of toothpaste foam. 

""Take your Allegra, Drew."" Tucker brought in a mug of water and set it on the nightstand next to the bed.

""I'm almost eighteen! You don't have to tell me to take stuff,"" Andrew protested. He waited until Tucker wandered off to fetch his clothes, then swallowed the small pill with a gulp of water. The liquid felt distinctly foul as it slid down his throat. Wrinkling his nose in distaste, he said, ""Where'd you get this?""

""Tap,"" muttered Tucker distractedly, ""out of the sink.""

The answer relieved Andrew; he was afraid it'd come from the toilet. Tucker was cruel like that. ""Oh. It tastes funny.""

With a long-suffering look thrown at his brother, Tucker grabbed the mug and took a sip from its rim. ""It tastes like water, Andrew.""

""It tastes like -- "" Evil, he wanted to say. "" -- like the time when Larry stole that chalice with the goats all over it from the school librarian and made me drink stuff out of it. Not really the taste, exactly, but the sort of squiggy feeling it gave me.""

Blankly, Tucker stared at his brother. Then he said, ""I have an essay I need to work on with Zillah. Perhaps you can occupy yourself for the morning.""

""I'll get lost,"" whined Andrew in a small voice.

Tucker gave a highly annoyed sigh. ""You won't. Just... go tour the museum, okay? Then I'll come get you when I'm finished, and escort you safely through the scary, scary campus.""

""You're mocking me!"" The younger boy pouted.

""Yes, Drew, I am. Observant, aren't you.""

""I didn't want to spend the day with you anyway, Tucker,"" said Andrew, trying to mask the hurt in his voice. ""You're always like, oh Drew, you're so not cool enough to be around me, you're a little fairy hobbit with bad sweaters, you say things that are really dumb around -- ""

Tucker gave his brother a quick smack to the back of the head. ""Retract the force shield, Drew."" He looked annoyed still, but gave a small, kind smile. ""We'll spend the afternoon together. Don't go all bitch on me, 'kay?""

""Kay,"" muttered Andrew. He was placated, but not satisfied.

Tucker grabbed a heavy bookbag off a chair. Though he'd grown, he was still thin. The weight caused him to stumble slightly, but he regained his balance and tried to look unaffected. ""Have some cereal, watch TV, whatever. If you want to see the museum, you can't miss it. Not even *you* can get lost.""

Andrew was pouting again. ""I don't need you to explain everything to me like I'm some little kid.""

""But you are."" Tucker ruffled his brother's hair. ""You're still my kid brother.""

*   *   *

Meanwhile, across campus, in a room in which Tucker will arrive in six minutes' time:

She paced the room restlessly.

As if circumstances weren't difficult enough with Tucker being so goddamn inept with his summoning, now he was baby-sitting his stupid baby brother for the week. 

Things may have gone much faster had she not brought Tucker into the plot. Now he was in, however, and she'd have to deal with him in partnership in order to perform the ritual. Which needed to happen soon -- sooner than soon -- before the astral window slammed shut.

""Unless..."" Zillah's forehead creased in thought, and she crossed the room to her antique desk. Papers were stacked in neat piles atop it; she sorted through, careful not to disrupt the order, until she found that which she was seeking.

Her unblinking eyes scanned the page, then lit up with joy. She gave a low chuckle, sinister as any villain older and more evil than herself, and grinned behind the paper.

<i>""Keen.""</i>

*   *   *

The museum, surprisingly, was quite a letdown. Andrew had seen fossils before, and old bones. He enjoyed the mutated fetuses and such, pickled in jars that lined a section of wall. 

The book collection was somewhat impressive, but Andrew had read most of the questionable books, and a good many of the ""evil"" tomes could be found at Sunnydale High's library. Before it exploded, that is. A sign stated that more volumes could be found ""with particular permissions"" in the vault. Naturally, Andrew was off to the vault.

As he approached the main desk, a middle-aged woman seated behind it smiled at him. ""May I help you?""

Andrew nodded, shyly. ""Uh... I was wondering... if that pickled squid is actually a big normal squid, or a baby giant squid.""

""Actually, it's an octopus."" She'd hardly blinked before answering. ""Medium-sized.""

""Ah..."" Andrew nodded in response, like it'd been the most fascinating thing he'd heard all day. Now that he'd broken the ice, he casually asked, ""Can I go see the stuff in the vault?""

The woman took in Andrew's baby face and messy hair. ""Do you attend classes at Miskatonic?"" 

""Uh."" He shook his head slightly. ""No,"" he said in a deflated voice.

""Access to the books and artifacts in the vault is restricted to students and researchers only with written permission from certain members of the staff."" She adjusted her glasses and looked down at the disappointed young man. ""I'm sorry, but the contents are much too -- ""

""Eldritch?"" Andrew supplied.

""I was going to say fragile, but that too.""

""Oh."" Andrew did his best to look serious and mature. ""I would be very careful with the books. And... and I wouldn't even touch the other things. I have a lot of fragile things at home. My comics, my action figures... and I only broke one of those, and that was only 'cause my friend Jonathan had a little mishap with some Pop Rocks and -- ""

He felt a little funny, like his insides were drying out. The woman gave a mysterious smile and turned her attention from him; a moment later, she handed Andrew a note written on a Garfield post-it.

""I've got a lecture to give in ten minutes' time. If you're still interested in ...eldritch things... give that note a glance later tonight."" She'd risen from her seat as she talked, and lifted her tote over her shoulder. 

""Okay,"" Andrew said absently. He was staring at the post-it; Garfield was cutting all the Mondays out of a calendar. <i>Andrew Wells is prohibited from entering restricted areas of the campus,</i> read the pretty cursive writing. <i>This includes areas of the museum, library, labs and catacombs.</i> It was signed <i>Ms. Hepzibah Haelstrom.</i>

Her name sounded like a character out of a fantasy book. Andrew was afraid he'd said that aloud, but looking up, discovered he was alone in front of the desk. Which was just as well, since if she'd still been here, Andrew would've given her a stern piece of his mind. Just like he'd done earlier, with Tucker. 

Looking over the note again, he cursed Ms. Hepzibah Haelstrom. He cursed her stylish glasses, her shallow crow's feet and her nice penmanship. And when did he tell her his name?

<lj-cut text=""Ficlet: Living the After-Life"">
<i>""Though he is dead, he haunts your dreams...""</i>

Andrew still thinks about Warren a lot.

On Saturday, he and Dawn visited a hole-in-the-wall record store in Santa Monica, where she dug through boxes of bargain cassette singles from the '80s and he browsed the zines.

Music was playing; it was at first a background noise, but the shop was otherwise silent so it was the song on which his ears focused. It was pleasant, and catchy. He considered asking the clerk for the band's name. Then the last lines sent a dizzying rush through his head:

<i>""I gaze into your eyes of blue
But their beauty is not for me
You're thinking of someone who's gone
You're dreaming of the one you really love""</i>

He slowly rose and rushed out in desperate need of fresh air, catching the final line at the door: <i>""You're dreaming of the corpse you really love""</i>. 

Outside, Andrew slumped against the building and focused on controlling the wave of nausea.

Last night, it took three Tylenol PM to keep from thinking of Warren. It's been worse since the destruction of Sunnydale, almost as bad as it'd been in Mexico last summer. Andrew realized that now he'd never have any memento of his first (and only) love, as everything had collapsed into the sinkhole that'd been their city. The little model Enterprise they'd built together, the episode of Seinfeld they'd purposely taped over an experiment in amateur pornography, the One Ring that he'd worn all winter because Warren had given it to him, even though it'd turned Andrew's finger dark green.

There was nothing tangible to hold onto, and no body to even prove Warren was once alive. Warren had lived and left nothing. It had an existential beauty to it, but it was a beauty Andrew couldn't appreciate. Artistic musings had no place in real love or real death.

He hoped the afterlife was treating Warren well. Andrew wondered if there was Dr. Pepper around after death, because Warren could drink a 12-pack in a few hours. He'd proven it once and earned five dollars from Jonathan as a result, then spent the next half hour puking into the neighbor's shrubs.

In addition to the refreshments, Andrew hoped Warren had friends in the afterlife. Maybe he and Spike would get along, since they'd met a few times and were of the cuddliest kind of evil. What if Katrina was giving him a hard time? It was little consolation to Andrew that Warren could now hang out with Jonathan. Andrew hoped they didn't get together to say bad things about him behind his back.

During a rainy week in November, the three boys had played a marathon game of Scrabble that'd lasted 27 hours before Warren's mother insisted they end it, then took the lettered tiles away to ensure sleep was had. Since they'd be there a while, he figured Jonathan and Warren could continue the Scrabble marathon without him.

Okay, so maybe he felt a bit left out, still being alive.

Sometimes, Andrew hates the fact that he survived the last battle. It would've been such a good opportunity for a dramatic death. He would've been a hero, and maybe Xander would've cried over *him* and not Anya. Then, he'd get to see Jonathan and Warren again. And Spike, with whom he was just recently getting friendly.

The big drawback to dying would be missing The Matrix: Revolutions and The Return of the King. Oh, and he'd never get to know how badly Hollywood butchered the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen movie. And he'd miss eating Ben & Jerry's with Dawn, or talking to Xander and watching him blush and act shy when Andrew tried flirting. Reassessing, Andrew would move Dawn and Xander to the top of the list. He'd miss them more than he would a few movies, no matter how awesome said movies promised to be.

So Andrew did have a lot to live for; much more than he'd had in Sunnydale, and it made it easier to cope. Someday, he'll finish drawing his comic book (featuring a gay witch that will die horribly in every issue) and display it with the other zines at that little record shop in Santa Monica. Someday, he'd get Xander to kiss him, and he'd learn to feel at home in Los Angeles, and perhaps learn to conjure up a portal in which he'll throw Angel's Barry Manilow albums.

Someday, he'll be able to think of Warren without wanting to kill himself. Until then, he had friendship, hope and sleeping pills.

There's a raised eyebrow, and then a smile cracked the handsome synthetic face. Warren's own voice answered back. ""Thanks, I know.""

Warren had outdone himself. This wasn't some perky little doll like April or Buffy; this was a creation, a legacy, a marvel of technology, ingenuity and love. Warren let his palm rest on its warmed skin, splayed his fingers out through the thick, dark hair that covered the chest. 

The bot tilted its head, its expression a mix of amusement and confusion. 

<i>Impressive.</i> He was incredibly pleased with the intricacy of its emotional reactions.

Warren leaned forward, bracing himself against his robotic double. Experimentally, he pressed his mouth against the robot's pliant lips. As he pulled back, he noted its expression had changed little.

""I don't understand,"" Robo-Warren stated.

""Course you don't."" Warren gave the robot a firm pat on the shoulder. ""That's what makes you a pile of preprogrammed circuitry and me a spontaneous, unpredictable human being."" He went to work buttoning the shirt in which it'd been dressed. ""I'll have to work on that in the upgrade,"" he mumbled to himself."

Title: Sneak
Author: Flannery
Rating: PG
Pairing: Andrew/Spike... kinda.
Summary: Something formerly evil lurks in the shadows of the basement.
Warnings: Partial male nudity. Excessive dust. May cause sneezing and watery eyes. 
Notes: Takes place circa ""Bring on the Night"", but no spoilers.

<lj-cut text=""*   *   *"">
*   *   *

He'd sneaked down to the basement in the darkest hours of the morning. While teenaged Slayerlings slept, while sexy souled vampires prowled, Andrew lurked. He imagined himself swathed in shadow, simply shining eyes and wide, predatory grin like the Cheshire cat. If only he had a tail to swish about as he padded stealthily across the cement floor. Somehow, a tail would make the sneaking better. 

If one looked past the weapons hung along the walls, ignored the presence of the chains and manacles, paid no attention to the random bloodstains and didn't notice the huge box marked ""outfits Buffy's already worn"", one would think this was any other typical basement. Of course, ignoring all that was a big thing to ask; fortunately Andrew had already done his share of snooping the week before, so wasn't too distracted by the assorted oddities lying about. 

The basement was all hard floor, stacked storage boxes, cobwebs and dust. There were few traces of Spike in the room, though he'd been dwelling there for weeks. Only the rumpled sheets of the cot betrayed his residence. Beneath the bed, a small pile of black clothes was barely visible and next to the pile, a mug encrusted with old blood. 

Andrew wrinkled his nose up at the sight of the cup. Had that been sitting down here all week? Buffy would just have to throw the mug away. Seriously, Andrew would NOT be washing it. If they tried to make him, he'd drop the mug and shatter into a thousand icky pieces. He may have given up his evil ways, but his dark side still extended to doing dishes.

Crouching behind dust-covered cardboard boxes, Andrew realized how badly thought-out his plan was. Spike wouldn't be home for a while yet, so this would be a good opportunity to work on the details. The plan currently was this: hide in basement, watch Spike undress. Andrew decided he'd better formulate a cover story, just in case. And maybe an escape route. And if Spike caught Andrew watching him from the shadows and found his voyeurism to be flattering and a turn-on?

His brain abandoned specifics of the plan and found itself caught up in fantasy. Lost in thought, Andrew shifted on the floor and awaited Spike's return.

Return he did, after nearly an hour. By then, the dust had been causing Andrew to sneeze, and his legs had developed painful cramps from the strange position he was in on the concrete floor. Annoying, yes, but not unbearable. He was glad he didn't have that tail -- the last thing he needed was another body part in which to get a cramp.

Spike stepped through the door at the top of the stairs, carefully shut it behind him to avoid making too much noise. The world around the vampire slowed to a glamorous shampoo-commercial crawl as he descended the stairs, peeling off his tight black shirt as he moved. Andrew bit down on his lip. Those abs were worth all of the pain and allergy he'd been suffering.

Then Spike paused at the foot of the stairs, shirt still wrapped around his forearms.

""I can smell you, you know,"" growled the vampire.

Andrew swallowed hard.

""You reek of pheromones and Yoohoo.""

He cursed himself for not spending more time working out a backup plan rather than fantasizing about being caught. Because now that he'd been caught? Not so much fun as Andrew had imagined. 

Shakily, he rose to his feet. Spike directed his cold gaze toward Andrew, one eyebrow raised expectantly.

Blushing furiously, the boy blurted out, ""I was looking for, uh, for a... well, it doesn't matter, 'cause I couldn't find it, and I thought I'd ask you where... it wasn't so important really, so never mind..."" 

Spike's chest was all hard muscle under marble-white skin and it was so, so distracting. Five minutes later, if one had asked Andrew what he'd offered in explanation, he wouldn't have been able to repeat it. He'd been brainwashed by half-naked vampire body.

There was a pause. Andrew felt a sneeze coming on and wondered if he was allergic to awkward silence.

Finally, Spike narrowed his eyes at the embarrassed youth. ""I see,"" he said in a low tone, an amused smirk threatening to break through the icy expression.

Andrew shifted uncomfortably under the heavy stare. 

""Well then,"" Spike breathed out, gazing sensually at Andrew, ""Since it gets quite lonely down here, and I haven't had a nocturnal visitor in ages..."" He wadded up his shirt and dropped it to the floor. ""Why don't you have a seat on the cot and I'll give you a little show?""

To his shame, Andrew nearly fell down in shock. ""Really?"" He squeaked.

""No, of *course* not really!"" Spike snapped. ""Get outta my space, you creepy little twit!""

This time, Andrew did fall down. Without pausing to think, he scampered across the basement, past the scowling vampire and up the stairs. Spike couldn't physically harm him, of course. Andrew knew this. But it was better to quit while one was ahead. To retreat with one's dignity still intact. 

Mostly intact.

Well, barely intact, but not completely in shreds.

Andrew's theoretical tail would've been tucked between his legs.

""You... you killed a woman.""

Dark eyes crinkled with sinister mirth. ""<i>We</i> killed a woman.""

""And we got away with it.""

""Completely.""

""Wicked."" Andrew gave a half-smile. ""It's like, we can do anything now.""

Arms circled the blond's slight figure from behind. ""Or <i>anyone</i>."" A husky voice, warm and wet on his ear, made Andrew shiver. In no time, he was pressed against the door, mouth being devoured by Warren.

The pair didn't have much time alone together. This was acceptable, as both were so consumed by passion that taking it slow just wasn't an option. Andrew's fingers dug into Warren's hips as Warren ground against him, hands underneath Andrew's shirt, stroking his stomach and grazing his neck and rolling his nipples and

""Ah!"" The blond shut his eyes tight and thrust into the hand against his jeans. ""Oh, oh Adam!""

The hand froze in place, and there was a soft chuckle from his partner. ""So much for staying in character.""

""I got carried away."" The blond gave an abashed grin.

""Understandable."" Dark eyes narrowed, and again Adam began rubbing his hand against Tom's denim-covered crotch. ""We're due back on set soon. Let's not waste time over one little error.""

""Well,"" said Tom in a choked, quiet voice, ""Since this is an exercise to get inside the minds of -- ""

""Yeah, yeah, whatever."" Adam grinned at the blond, then nipped at his bottom lip. ""And your character is supposed to be more submissive. Now how about getting on your knees, <i>Andrew</i>?""

Tom sunk to the floor and smiled mischeviously up at the dark-haired man. ""How could I say no to you, Warren?"""

Title: The Call of Cthandrhu (part 1)
Author: Flannery Shaw (me! *waves*)
Rating: PG-13
Spoilers: None, but mentions events in ""I Was Made To Love You"" and ""The Prom"".
Disclaimers: The Wells boys aren't mine. Miskatonic University is not mine either. Zillah is, but not her heritage.
Feedback: I love feedback, and I'll love you if you feedback me.
Notes: Pure silliness! Apologies to Mr. Lovecraft. Takes place circa Buffy season five -- Tucker's quite settled into college life, and Andrew is about 17.

<lj-cut text=""*   *   *"">
*   *   *	

So there really was a curse on this city.

His flight had departed later than it was supposed to, leaving Andrew scrambling to his connecting plane. 

The bus from Boston had overheated. He'd fallen asleep while they'd been stranded, and awoke to find that the old lady up the aisle had stolen his gummy worms and fed them to the squirrels outside. It wasn't like he could say anything about the theft, either -- ""Excuse me, are those my gummy worms? Because I had gummy worms, and now I have none, while you are up to your psoriatic elbows in sweet gummy goodness."" No, that wouldn't work.
	
It was late evening when he'd reached Arkham. His loitering earned a growl as a chubby goth girl tripped over his unattended backpack. Thankfully, Andrew had missed rush hour, though the sprawling walkways of the college grounds were still bustling with students.

Andrew looked like a lost puppy as he wandered the vast campus. He'd toured UC Sunnydale in the spring, but this was much different. Everyone was more pale, for a start. The buildings were old and spooky-looking. And he could've sworn he saw a guy tiny stubs of horns on his forehead -- okay, so that wasn't so different from Sunnydale.

A familiar voice cut through the chaos around him. ""Lost, little boy?""

""Tucker!"" Andrew squealed happily. He threw his arms around his older brother in a warm hug.

Tucker ruffled his brother's hair and casually draped an arm around his shoulders. ""Welcome,"" he said, ""to your personally guided tour of Miskatonic University.""

The younger boy bounced in place. He was so happy to see his brother; they hadn't seen each other since Christmas, with the enchanted eggnog incident. And he was excited to visit the famous Miskatonic campus. He'd read fantastic stories about the college, and his brother had made it sound like heaven on earth. Granted, a heaven full of ancient dark artifacts, unspeakable secrets and legendary books of blackest magic...

""Tucker?""

His train of thought was interrupted as a young woman approached them. She looked, thought Andrew, like a bipedal frog with brown Herbal Essences-commercial hair.

Tucker gave a broad smile. ""Zillah! I was just thinking about you!""

The petite girl fixed large, unblinking eyes on Andrew. Suddenly he felt like scampering all the way back to Sunnydale and cowering under his bed.

""Your younger brother?"" The girl's voice seemed strangely inhuman.

The dark-haired boy nodded. ""Yes, this is Andrew. Andrew? Meet my girlfriend, Zillah Waite.""

""Charmed,"" said Zillah, offering her hand.

Andrew shook it. She felt clammy, and he really wanted to wash his hand afterward. With bleach, and possibly holy water.

""Zillah's totally wicked, Drew."" Tucker exchanged a small smile with his girl.

""Tucker tells me you dabble with the summoning of minor hellbeasts."" Her wide mouth cracked into a sharp-toothed grin. ""Well, I do suppose one must start somewhere.""

On his arm, Andrew had a scar from being bitten by a winged monkey. He did not consider that minor, and wanted to say so, but found himself unable to speak to the strange girl. He'd been tongue-tied around girls before -- females being so temperamental and able to kick his ass -- but he'd never before felt like his voice had died in his throat. (Not counting that mysterious laryngitis outbreak last year, of course.)

Zillah seemed to look triumphant at his silence. ""Your brother is shy,"" she said, again with the chill-inducing smile. She stood on tiptoes and gave Tucker a brief kiss on the cheek. ""I must be off. I'll see you soon, my dearest little shoggoth.""

""Goodbye, my terrible beast of the shadows!"" Tucker was casting the most adoring look at her as he waved his farewell.

The small, creepy woman paced backward, brushing hair back behind her ear. ""Nice meeting you, Andrew,"" said the evil thing. ""We should go out for frogurt tomorrow, the three of us.""

As she left, Andrew wrinkled his nose and whispered, ""Does she always smell like that?""

""Like what?""

""You know..."" He shifted uncomfortably, trying to phrase it in the least offensive way. ""Sorta ...fishy.""

""Fishy?"" Tucker frowned ponderously. ""Huh. I never noticed.""

He decided not to bring up the fact that she appeared to have gills.

""So what'd you think of her?"" Tucker asked.

""She's strange.""

""She's not strange. That's just how women *are*.""

He shook his head in response. ""Nuh uh. She's like, some weird semi-amphibious girl with a terrible family name and unspeakably dark heritage, hailing from a shadowy and myth-haunted coastal town where outsiders daren't enter, or something.""

Tucker snorted. ""You read too many comic books. And anyway, you have a crush on a guy who built his last girlfriend.""

""But Warren doesn't smell like an anchovy,"" muttered a defensive Andrew.

""Warren likes girls, with actual girl parts. Not little twinks who can recite entire episodes of Babylon 5.""

Under his breath, Andrew said, ""Scenes, maybe, but not entire episodes.""

With a frustrated sigh, Tucker grabbed Andrew's duffel bag. ""Come on, we're going to the dorm."" He took off walking at a quick pace. 

""But I haven't seen anything yet!"" The younger boy protested. It was a struggle to keep up with Tucker, who'd never seemed to stride so fast when they'd lived together. Except during the eggnog incident; all sorts of laws of physics had been broken in their noggian escape.

""You're giving me a geek headache,"" his brother said crossly as they walked. At Andrew's crestfallen look, he added in a more gentle tone: ""Besides, it's nearly dusk, and the night before the full moon. Not a night to be out for a stroll around here.""

""Kay,"" muttered Andrew. It was an acceptable explanation. Being from Sunnydale, he was used to odd happenings on certain moon nights. He hoisted his backpack up over a shoulder and sped up to match his brother's long strides.

<i>Takes place after Spike bites Andrew.</i>

The room was quiet enough that the even the tiniest noises were amplified. For example, a sharp exhalation of air, or --

""You'd better not be scratching at it again!""

The noise stopped abruptly as Xander turned around.

""I'm not,"" Andrew said, hands folded angelically in his lap.

Xander crossed his arms over his chest. ""You were; I could hear you. Look, if you keep messing with the bandage, it'll get infected.""

""I know,"" muttered Andrew. ""It's just -- "" His hand twitched like he was going to bring it to his neck. ""-- bothering me. It's all stingy.""

""That's the antiseptic. Believe me, you don't *want* to know where Spike's mouth has been.""

Andrew shook his head. He didn't. 

""Right,"" stated Xander, ""so you just sit there like the evil little fungus that you are, and I won't have to use the ropes again.""

Peace and quiet returned for another few minutes before Andrew let out a loud whine, like that of an irritated animal.

Xander turned and glared.

""It *burns*!"" Andrew said defensively.

""Well, what do you want me to do about it? Kiss it and make it better?"" Xander snapped, barely restraining himself from choking the boy with his bare hands.

There was another silence. Andrew then answered in a timid voice, ""Okay.""

Xander blinked. He started to say he hadn't meant it. But there sat Andrew, alone and wounded and miserable, and he just wasn't cruel enough to make the kid's night any worse.

Gingerly, he sat next to Andrew on the bed, then planted a tiny kiss next to the bandage on his neck.

""There."" Xander looked gently at Andrew. ""Better?""

Andrew's cheeks were pink, his lips slightly parted, eyes big with surprise. ""Um."" He swallowed hard. ""Yeah. Better.""

""Good."" Xander needed to finish taking measurements of the new hole in the Summers abode.

""Uh, except...""

Xander raised an eyebrow. ""Except?""

""My cheek still kinda hurts,"" Andrew pouted, ""from where I was hit.""

""So? Mine does too.""

""Oh. Yeah."" Andrew looked down at his hands and mumbled, ""Well, I could, like, return the favor...""

""No,"" Xander said without hesitation. ""No, with a side of *absolutely not*.""

Andrew shrugged. ""That's cool,"" he said quietly.

Within five minutes, Andrew was scratching at the gauze again. This time, Xander didn't say a thing; he simply grabbed the ropes."

Pairing: Xander/Andrew (Andrew POV)
Spoilers: Season seven, particularly ""Conversations With Dead People""
Disclaimers: All bow before Lord Whedon.
Feedback: I'm such a needy person. Please feedback me!

<i>You said ""nobody loves me""
And I said ""wanna bet?""
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget</i>
      -- Stephin Merritt

*   *   *

""Hang on, Xander!"" He's looking up at me, teeth clenched, his hand limp in mine. No, not looking up at me -- looking up at where my face is, but his eyes are only half-open and unfocused and one is all bloody, but I don't think it's from a, a cut on the eye, but just from blood dripping into it.

He can't see me, so I squeeze his hand and say, ""Xander, don't leave me!"" loudly, my mouth nearly on his ear. 

It's funny -- well, not really funny, I guess strange would be the better word -- the stuff you think about when you're terrified and bad things are going on all around you. Like then I remembered that Xander likes having his ear kissed. Not that I'd know from personal experience, I mean. It's just one of the many things one picks up from a casual conversation with Anya.

It's been for-*ever* and still no paramedics. There isn't anything I can do to distract myself, to pass the stupid slow minutes I sit here. There's nowhere else to look, except at Xander, 'cause the rest of the house is in even worse shape than he is. It's all in ruins with furniture and stuff tossed around and there's some burnt, uh, beams just sticking out all jagged and smoldering, and over there somewhere I know there's a girl with... uh.. with a huge gaping hole... she looks like Chamber from Generation X. Except, not living.

My eyes are fixed on Xander's face. I know he's alive, because every time he breathes he exhales a bloody mist and it makes his lips all spattery. I know that can't be good, but I'm thankful for it, since it saves me having to get too close to his mouth. And there's a little muscle by his eye that twitches every now and then, like -- like he's wincing. With pain.

""Oh Xander."" My voice cracks like I'm sixteen again.

In the distance I can hear sirens. They sound close but not close enough, and everything's so *dead* -- SILENT, I mean silent, everything's so silent that I can't be sure they're anywhere near the house. I wanna run outside waving my arms so they know where to go, but I'm not gonna leave Xander, and the house is partly collapsed with big charred areas and probably some, uh... other indicators out in the yard. Not like they could miss it.

""Help is coming, and they're gonna make you all better,"" I tell Xander, and I try to believe it myself.

I stroke his hair, but when I do, my fingers get stuck in tangles stiffened with dried blood, and I think I accidentally reopen a wound on his scalp.

Suddenly paramedics are swarming around us like sharks, only not sharks that eat people but sharks that know how to stop all the bleeding. My ears are ringing and I didn't hear the ambulance arrive, or anyone enter through the, the crack in the front wall...

""We've got four victims!""

""He needs help!"" I shriek, which is kinda redundant at this point.

""Two dead."" It's sort of echoey, the woman's voice, and sounds far away. I think she's talking into a radio. ""One critical!"" I can't look at her. I'm looking at Xander.

They pull me away from him, and I don't resist. When you love someone you know when to let them go... or something. And I do love him. I wish I'd told him, and I try to shout it to him but my voice catches in my throat and I can't say it. My eyes won't move from the spot he was laying, even after Xander has been carried off on a stretcher.

There's a terrifying feeling that it'll be the last time I ever see him. No one will let me go with him, and it's no use to plead otherwise.

So there's, um, there's just the bloody pool where he was laying, and that's what I keep staring at. I stare so long that I start seeing images and patterns in the fluid, like when you look at clouds or Jell-O. 

Then the blood makes me think of all the blood that leaked out of Jonathan. 

The last thing Jonathan ever heard was, uh, it was ""No one cares about you"". That's the last thing I said to him and the last thing he heard.

I imagine I hear Jonathan talking, all about how all the cruelty and pain just fades away. It doesn't hurt. It's just... comforting.

I realize I'm like, completely worn out. Like I've been up for more than a day and have just been through a huge fight to the death against a really tough and fiery evil to save my life and the life of the man I love. 

Xander's safe now, on the way to the hospital. I let my eyes close.

*   *   *

Someone's moved me into a chair, and that's where I wake up. The room's sunny and first I think all that stuff earlier was just a dream. Then I realize I have no idea where I'm at, but then I notice Xander's sitting on white wicker bench nearby, reading, and looking kinda pale but otherwise completely not dead.

I'm so ecstatic that he's okay, and I want to run over and hug him, but my neck is killing me from sleeping in the chair. Instead I just say, ""Hi Xander!"" and smile at him.

I'm still sleepy and hear myself saying ""H'zan"" rather than what I'd intended.

His eyes shift over to me. (Later, I find out that he'd become proficient at spotting even the smallest twitches I'd make.) ""Hey,"" he says softly. ""Welcome back, you.""

A sharp pain from my mouth keeps me from responding. Xander's quick with a piece of cotton, dabbing at the blood leaking from my cracked lip.

""Don't say anything,"" he tells me, focused on the cut. ""Your lips are all dry and the skin's contracted. Not used to moving as much as they used to."" He chuckles weakly at his own joke.

""Here. They gave me some balm."" He mumbles as he rummages in the pockets of his coat. ""Don't worry."" He unscrews the top and brushes a finger across it. ""My hands are clean.""

My skin tingles under his touch as he smoothes his finger over my lips. The feeling is so intense, I whimper a little.

His smile is sympathetic. ""It's medicated, so you might feel some tingling. Or an intense burning sensation. I forget which.""

Watching him put the balm away, something finally sinks through. My lightbulb-over-the-head moment was this: No one wears a coat in Sunnydale in May.

Now, I know exactly where I am. One time, Tucker was attacked by one of his demon dogs. While he was recuperating, I'd wheel him out here to the bright hospital patio and help him catch up on homework he'd been missing.

My stomach turns and I ask, ""What happened?""

He looked like he'd been dreading that question. ""It's a good thing you can't stand up, 'cause otherwise I'd have to make you sit down to hear this.""

*   *   *

Xander wouldn't tell me much, that day. It took months to get the full story.

Since he was still nursing a previous injury, and I was useless to the Slayer group, the two of us stayed home while the others left to deal with the threat of the First. Two of the Potentials stayed behind too, to keep an eye on me and Xander. 

We were attacked at our most vulnerable. One girl ran screaming from the house and was torn apart before she reached the street. The other suffered an equally swift fate.

There was fighting, and a fire-spitting L'Rwc demon, and even Xander's not sure what happened because everything was so chaotic.

One of the attacking *Things* bit me. Giles speculated that it was some weird form of Malkacy demon with ""venom of a rather pitiful potency"". I said that it wasn't so pitiful to me, since it was my taco that got Tabascoed. Then Giles made me clarify what I'd said.

Xander, it turned out, survived with a broken leg and some cracked ribs and a few punctured organs, and looked like a patchwork quilt by the time he was stitched up.

I came out worse. My skull was cracked and I'd been impaled by something dull and wooden, and I'd lost a lot of blood. Xander still gets teary when he tries talking about my injuries, so I don't make him. I have a feeling that to this day, he's still keeping details from me.

The paramedics told him they had to carry me from his side, as there was no other way I'd leave. I really hope that's true, 'cause it makes me sound all neat and heroic.

Xander spent two days in bed. After that, he visited me at every opportunity. He told me a story about hiding out in my room past visiting hours, then spending the night sleeping next to me on the bed. They were gonna slap him with a fine and a ban, but Xander managed to talk his way out of it. He's so charming.

He said he talked to me all the time, and he would turn the TV up real loud when Enterprise and Alias were on, and tried to get the hospital to release me for a day so he could wheel my sleeping carcass to the theater to see the new X-Men movie. Since that didn't work, he had Willow download all the movies I missed: the Matrix sequel, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and something labeled as the Hulk that turned out to be gay porn. It actually came highly recommended by Xander. He watched it with me when I was all patched up and unable to be broken by, um, vigorous activity.

Xander moved me into his apartment. He kept me in bed all day -- for healing purposes, I mean -- and waited on me, cooked for me, helped me bathe... and, and so on. You get the idea. He's always telling me he loves me. I always say it back to him.

It's really funny -- no, not funny, *strange* -- how things end up. And this nags at me, sometimes, when Xander's holding me but sleep won't come: Everything seemed like it would conclude in such an awful way, with enough tragedy to go around, and it just seems illogical that there's such a gloriously happy ending for us.

Part of me is always going to wonder if this is really heaven.

He raked his fingers through dark hair and hummed softly. 

The night was perfect. The threat of the First seemed only a mere annoyance, like realizing your socks were inside out. Reality and disaster were irrelevant, faraway things. 

Andrew's entire world was focused in this moment: there was just the brisk Sunnydale air, cold grass and hard dirt beneath his legs, a clear sky full of dim white stars, and Xander's head in his lap.

""What're you humming?"" Xander didn't bother opening his eyes, and his tone was utterly relaxed.

""Didn't realize I was,"" Andrew laughed softly. ""I'll stop.""

The head in his lap shook slightly. ""Nuh uh. Don't."" Dark brown eyes cracked open and looked up at him, and Xander smiled widely. ""It's nice. I like it. I'm just a bit curious.""

""Just, you know, one of those random things.""

""That sounds like an evasive answer if ever I've heard one."" Xander smirked.

""Um, okay..."" The fingers in Xander's hair stilled and Andrew blushed. ""Remember when Sunnydale went all song-and-dancey?""

Looking uneasy, Xander muttered, ""How could I forget?""

""Well, that was in my supervillain days, you'll recall."" The air around them shimmered slightly -- the universal sign a flashback was on its way. 

""So I was with Warren and Jonathan...""

*   *   *

Somehow, the lair seemed darker and more foreboding than it had ever looked before. The trio had voted after an introductory song and, two to one, had decided it looked much more villainish.

Warren grinned maniacally and raised his arms skyward. In a gleefully evil song style, he sang, ""As devious criminals, we're quite sublime! We'll bring the town to its knees in no time!""

Andrew beamed enthusiastically. ""We'll soon defeat the Slayer!""

Jonathan, raising an eyebrow, added, ""From Warren's mother's basement lair?""

Arms crossed, the blond boy spun toward him. ""Jonathan, you're not a team player,"" he scolded in song.

It was time for Warren's solo.

""We'll be the kings of Sunnydale,"" he sang in a slightly sinister tone. He strutted confidently to the center of the room and rubbed his hands together. ""We will prevail. We will not fail!""

As Warren went on, Andrew sat down on the ambiently darkened stairs. He cast a dreamy gaze at the other man and soon, like vomit, he felt a song rising in his throat.

""Once the thought of romance was foreign to me."" The others seemed oblivious to his singing. In fact, his song seemed to twine perfectly with Warren's song of conquering Sunnydale. ""Then the gods above sent Warren to me.""

Andrew rested his head against the railing. ""If only, if only, if only he'd see how he's made my life so <i>heavenly</i>...""

Soft light suddenly shone on his impassioned face. ""Oh Warren, my Warren! I'd do anything <i>for</i> him, because I so <i>adore</i> him, oh Warren!""

As Andrew's voice swelled, he suddenly realized the other two had finished their song and were now staring at him. Warren, for once, was completely speechless.

*   *   *

Andrew was frantically waving his hands around. ""End flashback! End flashback!""

The shimmer around them faded. Andrew tried to regain his composure.

""Uh. Actually it's not a very interesting story, Xander.""

""No!"" Xander sat up, grinning. ""I want to hear the rest. You can't stop there!""

Andrew put on his resolve face. ""Can and will. It's my flashback,"" he stated defiantly.

Warmly, Xander said, ""On second thought, I didn't really want to hear you being all swoony over Warren anyway.""

""Aww, Xander."" Andrew curled himself up to Xander's warm chest as the other man's strong arms wrapped around him. ""That's so ancient, it's Triassic. If I could sing a, a Xander song, I totally would. But like, what rhymes with Xander? ...gander, meander?""

""Electric sander.""

""Yeah,"" said Andrew. ""I guess. Not very romantic though, is it?""

""Blander? No, wait. No."" Xander rested his head on Andrew's shoulder, looking thoughtful. ""Salamander?"" He suggested.

Andrew snuggled back against him. ""What about me? Where's my song? Andrew is easier to rhyme. Like... blue, mew, chew... er, kangaroo...""

""Do."" Xander's voice was loaded with innuendo.

""Gnu.""

""Blew,"" Xander smirked.

Andrew's cheeks went pink. ""Uh. Canoe.""

Xander gave a full-on evil grin.

""<i>Screw</i>.""

""Uh..."" Kazoo, he meant to say, but found hormones had erased all previous thoughts.

Xander's cheek pressed against his own. ""Andrew?""

""Hm?"" He squirmed slightly.

""Wanna go inside and make a little chamber music?""

Andrew looked puzzled. ""What? ... Is that a metaphor for-- oh! <i>Oh.</i>"" His sudden grin was pure enthusiasm. ""I get it.""

Xander helped Andrew to his feet and wrapped an arm around his waist. ""You really don't want to hear me sing anyway,"" he said as they walked toward the house.

Title: Snakeskin

*   *   *

They had a snake once. None of them knew exactly what type it was -- a small python, most likely, a length of shimmery scales kept in a glass box in Warren's basement. They were, however, disappointedly certain that it was simply a snake, with no demonic blood in its veins or tendency toward man-eating: One could never be too careful with one's animals when living on the Hellmouth.

""I wish it was a basilisk."" Andrew spent hours laying in front of the glass, head resting on folded arms. ""We could set it on the Slayer and it could just look at her and she'd die.""

From the couch, Jonathan said, ""She could turn to stone. Then we could use it to decorate our lair.""

""But it'd be so perfect,"" Andrew insisted, ""Everyone would just be all, oh, another unsolved mystery death on the Hellmouth. Such a shame. Bet those three handsome-yet-evil young men had nothing to do with it.""

Jonathan rolled his eyes and turned his full attention to the massive old and crumbling book covering his lap.

Warren delighted in feeding the snake. He'd started with small rabbits, but found that if he stuck to feeding it mice, he was able to do it more often. The little animal's hind legs would kick futilely as its front half was swallowed by the reptile, then the long tail would disappear into its mouth like slow-motion spaghetti. Once, when the others weren't around, Warren had tried experimenting with what other animals the snake would eat. A bird, a frog, a smaller snake, a neighbor's kitten -- it hadn't a craving for any of the creatures, to Warren's disappointment. Perhaps next time, he should starve it a bit.

Andrew watched the animal curl around its little branch. ""Maybe it is part demon after all. Its eyes have a demony reddish glint. And it's rather sparkly, isn't it?""

Exasperated sigh from Jonathan. The book closed with a loud thud that made Andrew jump. ""Its eyes are not red, they're black.""

""No, no, I said a red *glint* - ""

""There's no glint. And its scales are sparkly because it just finished shedding its skin on Thursday.""

""Yeah, Warren let me have the skin. He's so nice."" Andrew shot an adoring glance at Warren. 

The snake had long outlived its original purpose. It'd been bought as part of a ritual Jonathan had read about, one that would make the trio temporarily able to sense the body heat of others. Useful when robbing a bank or shoplifting porn, but in retrospect, not practical for busy days on the streets of Sunnydale.

Which didn't matter, because in the end, Jonathan hadn't been able to translate the spell from the Russian dialect it was printed in. So it seemed they had a new pet. Andrew was overjoyed, but mostly in relief that he didn't have to see the snake he'd bonded with get ritualistically sliced and gutted.

When Warren would pass by the cage, he'd often wonder if the snake would eat Jonathan. It ate small mammals. And Jonathan was a small mammal. Killed quickly or maybe kept alive, bound and gagged in his shower stall: The snake was little and would have to be fed pieces of the boy, and the longer he could go without killing Jonathan, the fresher the meat would be.

""We should take him outside."" Andrew's beaming face was reflected in the glass of the cage in front of him. He addressed the snake directly: ""You'd like that, wouldn't you? The lair's all dark and stuff, and it's warm and sunny out there.""

Jonathan grabbed his book and left the lair in a huff, mumbling something about being unable to concentrate. Warren smacked Andrew in the back of the head. ""Shut up about that thing, will you? I'm tired of hearing about it.""

""Ow!"" Andrew aimed a half-assed swat at Warren, which was easily dodged. ""Knock it off, retard!""

The snake was nameless, as Andrew had been prohibited from naming it. ""Jonathan's just going to kill it,"" Warren had said, as the boy in front of him winced at the idea. Now that it was more a pet than a sacrifice, he'd become so used to it not having a name that Andrew didn't bother thinking of one.

""I'm tempted to feed the snake Jonathan,"" Warren said conversationally.

Though the thought was awful, Andrew found himself giggling. He felt Warren's hand come to rest softly on his shoulder. Warren laid down next to him, arm around Andrew's shoulders, soft lips hovering near Andrew's ear. ""You stare at that thing so much,"" he murmured, breath making Andrew shiver, ""That I'm beginning to get jealous.""

Andrew shifted his weight so he was facing Warren, tilted his head just enough for a gentle kiss. ""You're just being silly,"" he grinned, then kissed Warren again. This time, he sucked Warren's lower lip into his mouth, and Warren responded by nudging at Andrew until he'd guided the boy onto his back.

Without breaking the kiss, Warren rolled on top of Andrew. His hands wandered over Andrew's t-shirt-clad torso, and he pressed his palm flat against Andrew's chest. ""You're always here to visit the snake."" He'd pulled his mouth from Andrew's, exhaled the words against the smaller boy's lips. ""You never come to see me anymore.""

""I do!"" Andrew protested breathily. ""I so do!""

The small animal had become the target of Warren's resentment. He was a jealous man, and loathed sharing Andrew's affections with a stupid reptile. Sometimes, he'd peek through a black veil of lashes as they kissed, and he'd see Andrew's eyes open and shifting uncomfortably toward the snake's cage.

""Oh! Warren!"" It came out half moaned, half giggled, and he ran his tongue over the bite mark on Andrew's shoulder. 

As Warren's long fingers slid beneath the waistband of Andrew's jeans, the smaller boy arched up with a hissed inhalation of breath. ""Warren... War..."" He was panting, practically, but then squirmed away from the touch. ""Let's go to your bed."" Eyes shifted again toward the cage, and Warren's dark eyes narrowed.

""No,"" he said curtly, then more seductively added, ""I don't think I can make it. Not with you looking so ravishing."" He punctuated the statement with a soft squeeze of Andrew's erection.

Andrew whimpered and bit down on his bottom lip. ""I don't feel *right* about doing this here,"" he whispered, trying to give Warren his best big-eyed puppy face. ""It's like ... like it's watching us.""

For a moment, Andrew was frightened by the dark look on Warren's face. Then Warren rose to his feet and growled, ""Fine. We'll go to my bed.""

The snake's short life in the lair was pleasant, full of plump rodents and sleeping in the large, soft front pocket of Andrew's sweatshirt. Its cage was kept clean and warm. Attention was showered on the reptile, and it became a sort of mascot as the three plotted their takeover of Sunnydale.

Warren only tolerated its presence for so long because Andrew so adored the little animal.

One day, it died.

""I'm so sorry, Andrew."" Warren's arms were around him and Andrew had collapsed sobbing against his chest. Tears left damp charcoal circles on Warren's gray t-shirt. ""I just woke up this morning, and he was dead.""

This wasn't a lie, exactly, because its neck had been broken the night before.

""But he couldn't die!"" Andrew's voice was choked with tears. ""I was so good to him."" 

The lair seemed cold and stagnant without the reptile around. Jonathan had simply frowned at the news, then helped dig the animal's grave. But Andrew was inconsolable; he wouldn't move from the couch, where he lay curled in a ball, hugging Warren's pillow.

Warren knelt before him, brushed messy blond hair from the boy's forehead. ""Are you doing okay, love?""

Andrew shook his head but leaned into the touch.

""Think of it this way."" Warren rested his cheek against Andrew's hair and lowered his voice. ""He may have only been alive for a short time, but you made that time really nice.""

""Thanks,"" rasped the blond. Warren could actually see tears welling up in Andrew's eyes, then leaking down his cheeks as the boy tried to blink them away.

He bent his head, kissed Andrew's wet face and continued, ""You loved it so much, I bet it made death and everything worth it.""

""Oh Warren,"" Andrew sighed. He threw his arms around the dark haired boy and buried his face in Warren's neck.

None of them remembered where the animal was buried. Now, Andrew never thinks about the snake, hardly remembered how devastated he'd been over its death. But back home in a closet, stacked amongst his comic books and Tucker's baseball cards, he still has the snakeskin, wrapped delicately in tissue paper and set in a shoebox. It was the most personal gift Warren had ever given him.

"event","It's been a few days since I have written in here...And guess what?SCHOOL IS OVER!!!  So much stress is gone.  Finals are done and I did very well this year, and it is all over.  
Let's see...What have I done since school has been out.  
Friday I went home, slept, babysat, and then went to see Harry Potter with Aaron.
Saturday I got my hair done, went shopping with my mom, went to the battle of the bands for awhile...Back to my house with Aaron.
Sunday I had to work for 8 hours!  Yuck!  And when I got home my mom told me I couldn't do anything, which sucked but I at least got time to relax.
Monday, Aaron and I went out for the day so I could get stuff for my trip to Maryland.  Then we both had to work.  After that we both went to Christina's and we watched Mystic River (dumb movie).  Then I slept over Christina's house.
Tuesday I left Christina's in the morning and basically was at Aaron's house til he had to go to work.  I took a nap and at 6 I had to go to this party for the trip I am going on this weekend.  It absolutely sucked.
And today...Aaron just left a little while ago.  And I have to work tonight at 3.  Yuck.
Tomorrow my mom is being gay and I have to stay home from like 12-2 because the water filter guy is coming.  So stupid.  She knows I am leaving on Saturday to go to Ridgely and she is making me stay home.  Oh well, I'll just have Aaron over.
I almost forgot...From now on my journal entries are friends only..."

"event","For once I wished things would get resolved.  But they aren't.  
I went to Aaron's today before my final and I don't think I have ever been that upset.  I cried for so frigin long, like an hour and a half.  I could not stop myself...I just kept thinking about the most depressing things, and I couldn't turn it off.  
So Aaron pretty much just doesn't care about what my last entry was about.  He calls it ""ridiculous"" when to me it isn't.  I completely see where he is coming from, it's not like I'm being one sided here.  But with recent circumstances and everything that is going on, I cannot agree with him.  He fell asleep while I was crying today.  If that were him crying I would have been holding him the whole time and trying to make him feel better, but for some reason I don't get the same in return.  I just went outside his room and laid down on the floor and cried the whole time.
I could not believe him today.  He obviously saw how upset I was, he obviously knew I am very bothered by what happened...Yet, he still only tried to justify his actions...Not make me feel better.  Yea, I got the ""what can I do to make up for it"" question, but how the hell do I know the answer to that?  I can't tell you what to do to make up for your mistakes.  Wait, you don't think it's a mistake even though I practically wanted to kill myself today (not really, I am exaggerating).
If only he agreed with me and gave me a heartfelt apology...Then I would be okay.  But it's too late for that now.  I already know he isn't sorry and I know he doesn't agree with me that he shouldn't have done it.
All I want to do it yell at him for how stupid he is.  But I won't because that won't do either of us any good.  I try to talk to him about it, but somehow I can never make my point before we are talking about something else.  
Question time:  Why else would she ask for that if she didn't want you?  Why can't you try and help me for once?  Are you purposely trying to sabotage us (because subconsciously you are)?  How did things get so fucked up between us?  When are we going to get better?  Why don't you care when you see how much pain I am in?  Will you stop saying ""I'm sorry"" when you don't mean it?  Will you stop making things worse?  Will you please stop making me cry?"

"event","The little trust that Aaron had gained back is entirely gone.  I won't put what he did in here because I don't know if it will bother him or not if people know.  See Aaron?  All you have to do is take those 5 extra seconds and ask yourself ""Will this bother Laura?""  And if there is any doubt in your mind DON'T FUCKING DO IT until you ask!  I am really bothered by this, more like extremely bothered.  I wouldn't just send guys those things without asking you.
You totally just brushed it off like it was no big deal.  Empty ""I'm sorrys"" and no proof that it will ""never happen again.""  I think you knew it would bother me, but just never thought I would find out.  You are seriously challenged if, especially what only happened 2 weeks ago, you thought in anyway, shape, or form that this would be okay with me.  Common sense tells you that if you cheated on me, and we are no closer to getting over it than when we were when you first told me, you shouldn't make it appear in anyway that you might be cheating on me.  That was all I could think of when I saw that.  And I don't care where ever the hell she lives, the fact is, you weren't thinking of me when you did it.
At any other time, I most likely would have been okay with this.  Just asked you not to do it again, or at least ask me before you do it.  BUT considering I still cry every fucking day from what you did, it bothers me just a little that you are involved with someone else, despite it being online.  
I am so disappointed in you...I feel the same way right now as the night you told me about Monika.  Just one little thing like that can make everything resurface again...Which is something I would have thought you know well.  But apparently not.  You obviously don't understand how much I am hurting and how badly I want it to go away.  But when you do something like this, however insignificant it is to you, my pain is never going to go away.  
Through all this sadness I am extremely angry at you.  When I asked you about it all you did was try to justify it...Not make me feel better about it ONCE AGAIN.  Your justifications didn't tell me the real reasons why you did it or why you made it seem like it was no big deal, even when I started crying.  My heart physically hurts right now, and you won't even notice...Because you think just because you tell me ""I won't ever do it again"" means something to me.  You already did it...You already hurt me.  You can't take it back and I don't know how you can fix it.  My hope is dangling by a thread right now...And YOU are the only one who can decides if it snaps."

"event","So basically if I had it my way, right about now I would just stay in my room forever.  I cannot deal right now...
It's bad enough that I have school, and a job, and a boyfriend, and now finals coming up this week.  BUT my mom offers me no support whatsoever.  And then she yells at me for like an hour today about how I give nothing back to her...Maybe it's because at the end of the day I have NOTHING to give.  I just want the entire world to go away.  I'm so tired of crying because I am so drained and expected to keep giving out more.  I agree that with my mother I have fallen behind, but she should understand.  Whenever she has a bad week at work, or even a bad month I know that I should be as helpful as I can...But when my month has been absolute hell she doesn't help, let alone notice.  
My stress level could not be any higher right now.  My body is constantly tense, constantly tired.  I can't tell you the last time I've slept more than 9 hours.  I used to sleep for 14 hours on the weekends...And I felt good.  This shit is ridiculous.  I just cannot wait to get out of school, even though I will have 2 jobs.  But anything is better than what it is now.  I have fucking finals this week and I am working 2 out of the 4 nights...Just great.
I feel depressed, which to me is the scariest thought in the world.  I was depressed for longer than anyone can ever know, 3 fucking years.  I never want to go back to that...But after everyday goes by I see my happiness fleeting farther and farther away.  Every night before I go to bed I think about how badly I do not want to wake up in the morning...And when I do wake up I only find that nothing is getting better."

Sunday = working = sucked.  But after work I went to Aaron's house!  Yay!  Then did my homework til very late at night...
Yesterday was a normal day at school.  I was wicked excited though, when I was about to get on my bus, Aaron was there!  He came to get me =) That made me very happy.  Went back to my house, then I went to work.  It was a great time...NOT SO MUCH.  There are never enough people to help on front counter, and there were so many customers yesterday.  I could have died, literally.
Today was much better.  I actually woke up this morning and I wasn't too tired.  My mom gave me a ride in, and school was so easy.  No homework for Laura tonight!  And the best news of the entire day was that my mom let me go out tonight!  I went to Aaron's to go swimming, cause it was so fucking hot today.  
So!...Aaron and I are doing much better.  A lot of the times we are together I just forget about the whole Monika incident, sometimes not...But usually.  I hope things go back to the way they used to be soon, which it seems it is already well on its way to becoming.
So that has been my last 3 days...Now I am off to enjoy my free time!"

"event","Today I was with Aaron from 6:30 this morning until about a half an hour ago.  I had a really great day today.  Except for SATs, but at least Aaron was in my room.  
After SATs we went to Greendale...Then decided to go to Natick, my favorite place in the entire world.  I got a ton of stuff there, and Aaron tricked me and he ended up paying for it all (thank you baby).  Then we went mini-golfing, I finally won for once!  After that, we went to blockbuster for movies so we could watch them at my house.
He and I talked about a lot of what is bothering him.  He never tells me what is wrong.  I was so glad he did, despite that it was concerning, to say the least.  But I would rather know what is bothering him than just guess, because I assume the worst anyways.  
For almost all of the day I forgot that he and I have issues.  It was nice to just sit back, forget about it all, and have fun.  I think today was important for Aaron and I...We got to spend all that time together, talk about what is wrong, and just be close.  I wish he was still here...
Tomorrow I have to work, unfortunately.  After that I am going to try and get out to Aaron's house, but I don't know if the mother unit will let me.  She better since I can't do anything on fucking school nights anymore.  Not that it really matters, because I'll just leave school early if I want to do something.  So therefore, my mom's rules just cause me to do the exact opposite of what she wants...Miss out in school in one way or another.  Oh well, I'm not going to be trapped in the house all week...At least not this week.  I only have one more week until fucking finals where I lock myself up in my room for 12 hours at a time studying.  Ah, I am freaking out about them already...
It is 11:30 and I actually want to try and catch up on sleep since I have to get up at 9.  I love you all and goodnight."

Aaron came and picked me up and we chilled for like an hour...It was good, I got much need Aaron time.
Then I had to babysit, wasn't too bad this time.  There were no heaving objects flying at my head...He just wanted to eat food and then more food so I was basically cooking the whole time.  
THEN IT WAS HARRY POTTER!  That movie like made my life.  Frank and I had a rocking good time!  I had so much fun, not just cause it was Harry Potter, but because Frank and I got to chill.

Psychotic incoherencies escape her paranoia, 
As her mental infection continues to spread... 
And these inconspicuous discrepancies, 
Continue in their struggle to be heard,
In this mute world of ambiguous senselessness... 
Neglections push her harder, 
And further into her mind of conflicting ideas, 
Where her ever-present rejections dwell...
Behind the weeping eyes in her reflection,
Entirely fabricated words escape her mouth,
Hidden deep within the contentious monotony...
Decaying memories are just moments away,
Cancer's face unveils himself in the distance,
Forget the distorted images of this day...
Sincere apologies sealed in a smile of guilt,
Unable to comprehend what lies beneath the exterior,
Futile efforts lead to exhaustion...
Stranded with undermining criticism,
Caution is never carefully placed,
She stumbles in the foreboding deception...
Commitments broken and promises incomplete,
Imperfections rise to the surface to remain,
The perpetual illusions are clear in his eyes...
Dismal disasters design her insecurities,
One last attempt to salvage her heart,
The disappointments continue to control her life..."

"event","Aaron cheating on me has affected me more than I believed it would.  I have been crying off and on for the past 2 days.  I don't really even know what I am crying about, there is nothing in particular that has been bothering me.  Like I wasn't even thinking about the cheating thing and I just started crying, for no reason.  Nothing else is wrong though right now that would make me react that way except for Aaron...So I am assuming that is why I haven't been too happy lately.  The cheating issue really didn't bother me the day after he told me, it really didn't.  Maybe it just needed time to sink in or something, I don't know.  But whenever I talk to him or whenever I see him I just want to cry, or actually cry.  But I want to talk to him and be around him at the same time because it makes me feel better (if that makes any sense).  I feel more at peace when he is around, which is probably actually why I cry.  
I don't think I can get through this one by myself.  No, I definately cannot get through this by myself.  This feeling is awful, it's something I have never had to deal with before...I've never been cheated on.  Now that my clean record has been thrown away, I don't know what to do.  I don't know if I can get through this.  This hurts way too much right now.
Aaron, I just wanted you to love me...And you couldn't even do that."

"event","I didn't go to school today, mainly because I am exhausted in every way possible.  Nothing is going right...Aaron, school, work, my family...It's all just slowly dying.  And I just needed a day to sleep in and study for my huge history test and my humanbio final this Friday.  My mom threw this huge fit about me staying home today.  I usually never miss school, and I really needed today.  I'm not missing anything important.  It pisses me off that she doesn't understand how fucking stressed out I am.  I can't deal with half of this shit that is being thrown at me right now.  And she just adds to the problem by not trying to help in anyway possible.
Before I start crying, we're changing topic.  Actually, this one isn't much happier.  I decided that I should see Aaron last night.  We went to Friendly's and back to my house.  It was very good.  I really needed to see him and to talk to him.  He is really upset about what he did, which I expected.  I just wish that he wouldn't say that doesn't he deserve to be helped.  Of course he does, we are in this together...He is not alone.  If he needs help, he knows I am always here, but that doesn't mean he will ask me for it.
He and Mike wrote/sang/played a song for me yesterday.  Aaron went to Mike's and Mike called me up with it...It was thoughtful to say the least.  I appreciated the effort, it was very nice.
Aaron and I were just sitting in his car yesterday and he made me feel better about cheating in the future.  He promised me that he will be able to stop himself if he is ever in that situation again.  He couldn't promise me that before.  Not to say I am just going to believe whatever he says, but it did make me feel better.  And I told him that if it happens again, he better know that I am not going to be with anymore, at all.  Yea, that was the basis of the conversation.
I have to work later today.  I had the day off, so I'm not going to mind.  I'm done with history, all I need to do is study for humanbio!  ::slowly walks backward into corner::  It is going to be such a beast.
Marc has been talking to me a lot more lately.  I don't really feel comfortable talking to him.  He wants to drive me home tomorrow, and I'm like...NO THANKS, I'M ALL SET.  He is in my study now and I'm like the only person he knows.  And of course, being the idiot he is, he thinks everything is fine between us, but it NEVER will be fine.  Everyime he talks to me it's just pain.  Yesterday he mentioned that one time he was at my house, and I had to get up and go to the bathroom because I was crying.  I fucking hate him so much...
Aaron wrote me a nice letter in his Live Journal, thank you dear.  I think things are going to be okay.  Not necessarily tomorrow, or in a week, or in a month, but somwhere I know it will all be okay.  I'm in the process of forgiving him, and hopefully he is in the process of forgiving himself.  When I was with him yesterday, I really didn't feel any different towards him.  I mean, I wasn't exactly my normal self, but I was still relatively the same.  I really just want him to feel better, because I am okay.  I don't dwell on things like he does.  I really am okay, still very hurt, but doing fine."

"event","AARON CHEATED ON ME.  How the hell did that happen?  He did it like two weeks ago and he just decided to tell me last night.  It was with this girl Monika and he fingered her...Sixty times worse then if she did stuff to him.
He says that it is his weakness, that he can't say ""No"" when a girl wants something.  I believe that it is a weakness of his, but it shouldn't affect him when he has a girlfriend, I don't care what he says.  
And why would he ever let himself be alone with Monika in the first place?  He has done stuff with her before, and she is attractive...So what the hell?  I would never put myself in that kind of situation.  He must have known something was going to happen.
The most fucked up part of it all is that we went to see her at Target AFTER he did stuff with her.  He actually made me meet her knowing he cheated on me with her.  
He kept it to himself for two weeks.  He didn't feel bad about it UNTIL I knew.  So basically that tells me he didn't feel bad about what he did, but about what the consequences of his actions might be.  That is a normal reaction, BUT it also shows me that he really doesn't see how big of a deal this is.  I am not sure how to convey to him how big of a deal this is either.
I am glad this happened now though, only a month into our relationship.  Because if it had been like 6 months into it, I would have said goodybye without even thinking about it.  But since he cheated on me when we were only together for 2 weeks, it seems less significant to the effect on our relationship.  Still a huge effect, but somewhat lessened.  
Today he came to see me at work during my break.  I was all prepared with what I was going to say, I wrote him a note and everything.  He had nothing to say, nothing.  He was just sitting there pissed at himself, not trying to make me feel better or anything.  He should be doing all that he can to make me feel better, but he did nothing.  Granted, after my break he left flowers in my car...But he didn't have the flowers initially, so I think that when I told him he should be doing more to make me feel better, he understood that he needed to do something.  Despite the delayed gesture, I did appreciate the flowers.  Not that it really changes anything, but at least he's trying.
It was really slow at work today so I had time to write him a letter.  Here's a summary:
I want to work things out, even though I don't know if it will work in the end.  I'm only asking him to not hang around girls he has done stuff with in the past or that he is attracted to.  He and I are going to stop the sexual stuff for a while, because I don't want to be that close to him right now.  We are going to take a sort of break...Not see eachother for a few days, and I'll call him when I am ready to.  
This whole thing fucking sucks.  I'm so upset that he could do this to me.  I've never been cheated on before, ever.  I guess I'm just not enough for him...I can't keep him happy enough to remain faithful.  I have like zero trust in him right now, zero.  He's like in the negative numbers.  I cried for so long last night, so long.  And I was still crying when I woke up, and when I went to work.  I really don't know if things are going to work...And I have no faith in him not to do this again...Because he even told me that he cannot guarantee me it won't happen again.  I love him though, I really do and I can't leave him despite how much that seems like the right thing to do.  I am a very forgiving person and I know I can get over this, I just wish he would forgive himself because I don't think he can get over this."

Yesterday Aaron came and got me at school and then we were together until 11.  We went to the mall and then to gameboro for the magic tournament.  I could tell Richie and Aaron didn't want us there, at all.  And since Christina and I really didn't have anything to do there, we aren't going to go back there.  I felt bad that Christina and I just like invaded, but I thought it was going to be a lot different than what it was.  Like I actually thought there would have been stuff for me and her to do, but there wasn't.  Meh, at least we were all together.
Today I went to BOTH of my jobs.  The paralyzed woman, Pat, I think I am going to like taking care of.  She really is funny and she has such a great outlook on things.  It's not hard or anything, I just need to get to know the machines that she uses.  I will like working with her SO much better than McDonald's.  I won't have to be bothered by fucking asshole customers all day.  I don't know, we'll see how it goes once I know the machines and more about Pat's everyday life.
After working, Aaron, Frank, Christina, Andrew, and Jill all went to see Shrek 2.  I absolutely loved it...It was so funny.  Then Frank, Aaron, Jill and I went to Friendly's, then back to Aaron's house.  I made it home in record time today...All the way from UMass in Worcester to my house, in 15 minutes.  It was beautiful.
Yea, so working tomorrow.  Then it is off to Shboom's with my dearest Christina!  I really hope I am not tired tomorrow, otherwise I won't be able to make it through the night there.  
Monday I am SLEEPING UNTIL 1 for once.  And then off to work.  I am getting so sick of working, it's so pointless.  It's not like I'm making a difference by working there, I'm not changing people's lives or anything.  Whatever, it's money, not that I've ever really needed it.

Friday: I have had better days.  Aaron and I got into a fight/disagreement (I don't know what you would call it).  I was at his band practice and I told him about Marc, and he pretty much flipped on me for how ""disguisting"" it was for me to do that with him.  I was wicked mad at him and he was mad at me, but we ended up talking about it, and all was resolved.  I basically told him that Marc was one the biggest, if not the biggest, mistakes of my life, and he rubbed it in my face.  Apologies were exchanged, ect ect, back to normal.  After my Aaron time I went over to Christina's.  We went to friendly's and had one the funniest times I have had in a long time.  Then we watched prom on tv, it was interesting.  Then it was s l e e p...One the best parts of the day.
Saturday: WORK FROM 11-7.  Worst day at work EVER.  But after work Aaron, my mom, and Robert all went out to dinner and then Aaron came back to my house for a couple hours.  The it was s l e e p.  
Today:  Went to see the paralyzed woman this morning that I might be watching over the summer.  She's really nice, I liked her.  Then it was off to work once again, 10 -4.  Sucked as usual.  Then I came home, gave BOTH of the cats a bath, then went over to Aaron's.  After I came home from Aaron's, I attempted to do my homework, but it really didn't happen.  And now I'm all wired, for what reason I do not know, and I really want to go to bed, but I can't because I'm not tired.  And I have to work tomorrow, so I really should be getting to bed....BUT AH!  It isn't going to happen.  ::STRESSING ALREADY::
This week is going to be made all the worse in the fact that I am not going to see Aaron, like at all.  I'm working Monday and Wednesday, and he's working Tues-Thurs.  And on Friday he's hanging out with Richie.  And we are both working on Saturday and Sunday.  So, yea, we are skipping sometime this week because I will seriously die without seeing him until Saturday, not even kidding."

This weekend is going to suck so much.  Saturday I have to work 11 to 7 and Sunday 10-4.  That's 14 hours of my weekend gone!  Sunday isn't too bad, but Saturday just sucks...I probably won't even do anything after work because I will be so tired.  And where is Aaron time...anywhere?
Well, I should probably get going.  By the time I actually decide to walk out the door I'm going to be late anyway."

Listening loudly to a silent scream

Lost in someone so warped & twisted

Harsh words and doors that close
Hidden secrets no one knows

Deep inside I'm warped & twisted

So many tricks and so many lies
Too many whens and too many whys
I'm not important and I'm not gifted
All alone I'm warped & twisted

On my knees, alive but dead

I'm not gone but my mind has drifted
Don't expect much, I'm warped & twisted

Burnt out, wasted, empty, and hollow

The fire has died, the ashes sifted

Why the hell would Aaron invite Kara to come with us ANYWHERE?  Sometimes I wonder if he likes provoking me, if he wants to get me upset.  And when I tell him that I am not going because she is going, he gets all pissy at me!  Excuse me if I don't want to jump across the table and punch her.  It would ruin everyone's day, so I choose to remove myself from the situation entirely.  He was the one who should have though the five extra seconds and asked himself, ""Maybe this is going to piss Laura off, so maybe I shouldn't invite Kara.""  She wouldn't bother me except that he did stuff with her the day after he and I really ever did stuff together.  It's not that I have a problem with her either, it's her and Aaron being together.  He told me he was very attracted to her so I'm not comfortable with it, especially if I am there.  Anytime he would talk to her or laugh with her, my anger would just rise.  I can already see that I would be so pissed off that I would end up crying.  If it already upsets me to the point where I am crying, then tomorrow it will only be ten times worse.  I cannot believe he didn't understand that I don't want to go.  All he said was, ""well, at least you would get to see me.""  I don't want to see him if Kara is there!  I would think that this is something he would understand.  I don't get jealous about hardly anything, despite the fact that I know he is a wicked flirt.  It doesn't bother me.  So if something actually DOES bother me, I would expect him to understand.  But he didn't.  And it pissed me off.  I would understand if he was in the same situation, but wait, I wouldn't put him in that situation because it is absolutely ridiculous.  
He complains that he won't be able to see me for a while, but then he just goes and makes plans with Ryan, Keri, and Kara without even asking me if I can go or anything.  I hate when he invites Ryan and Keri to go places without even checking with me before he makes plans with them.  It's like, well now that you have invited them, they sort of have to come.  I don't invite my friends to come with us places...Because I don't see him enough to begin with.  If he actually checked with me in advance to make sure it was okay, I would say yes, only because I know that he wants them to go...And then it wouldn't bother me.  But when he just assumes that it is okay with me that they come with us, it really annoys me.  It makes me feel like he doesn't want to be alone with me.  Unless we are at eachother's houses, it seems like we are usually with other people.  Like we can't have fun together when we're not doing stuff at eachother's houses.  I know that's not how it really is, but sometimes it seems like it.  Like I'm not interesting enough to go places with, like he'll be bored if we go somewhere without his friends.  As I said before, I don't invite my friends to go anywhere with us...And I certainly would not just assume that it is okay with him for my friends to come with us.
I wanted to scream at him on the phone today.  He wouldn't tell me what was wrong, as usual.  And then he wouldn't even talk.  We sat in silence for like 10 minutes, not even kidding.  And then he miraculously is tired and wants to go to bed.  He should not be mad at me for not wanting to go.  I wasn't mad at him for inviting Kara, I was mad at him for his reaction when I told him I wasn't going.  He just sits there in silence...And says, ""well, at least you would get to see me.""  Like he's trying to guilt me into going or something...Sorry hun, doesn't work on me.  Your reaction today really pissed me off, I really thought you would have understood why I'm not going.  I AM SO PISSED RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!  I'm never going to be able to get to bed tonight...But at least I get to sleep late because YOU invited a girl you know I never wanted to see to hang out with us tomorrow.  Thanks, thanks a lot."

Yesterday was pretty good.  School was eh, work was better than it usually is.  I didn't have much homework either.  It was a good day overall.
Today was a lot of fun.  Aaron came over this morning for the time I had my delay, school was very easy, not much homework.  After school Aaron and I went to see Troy, and now I actually have time to relax!  Yay for Laura!
I don't have work until Saturday!  Yes!!  But I pretty much have to work all weekend long, and Aaron does too...But he has band practice on Friday.  Therefore, weekend = no Aaron time.  SADNESS!
Hopefully I can actually get to the gym this week.  I haven't been going at all.  Only like once a week.  Not good, not good.
Tomorrow I have my therapy appointment.  I haven't gone in 6 weeks now, and my god do I need to talk to her.  In these past 6 weeks, just about everything has changed...For the better, of course.  Hence why I am actually happy."

So here has been the last couple of days:
Yesterday, was the worst day I have had in a long time.  Right after school I had to work until 8, then go pick something up for my mom.  I wasn't home until 8:30, and then I had about 4 hours of homework.  But, of course, I decided only to do about an hour of it because Aaron called...And I felt like we needed to talk.  Things are resolved...I suppose...About what Richie and Christina were worried about.  So yea, another 4 hours of sleep night last night.
Today, much better actually.  Even though I am dead tired, I only have to work from 4 to 8...So that's better than yesterday.  And I've only got about an hour of homework, so I will actually get that done tonight.
I've got to go...Need to go to CVS and then to work!  Love to everyone (I'm in a very good mood today)!"

i am soo sry michele. i really didn't mean to hurt you like this and i feel like complete shit over doing this to you. but you have to know the truth becuz i am sick of lying. i do still like you and whoever said ""he is crazy for not wanting you back"" well you were wrong i do somewhat want her back. listen michele the only reason i am not with you is becuz with your parents and a few differences that we have if we tried again even this soon we would crash and burn worse than anything. i dont want either of us to leave this earth. listen though your friends need you soo much as do i need you even though i am not with you right now doesnt mean i dont want to still be your friend. i mean i do still have feelings and me being a ""asshole"" and ""trying"" to bring you down is not true cuz i hate seeing you sad. i dont want anything to happen to you. i cant be more truthful or caring towards you i may break promises i mean i try so hard but i am only human and i do have my own problems too but ill be here if you care to talk like andy said i wont let you leave either even if i have to break into your house and stop you i will not let you leave as long as i have anything to say about it. i am soo sry though i really do care and i do love you and after hurting you i cried when i got home friday i cried that night and went to frank's house cuz i didn't want to be alone and i cried saturday night too. i do still care just plz your friends need you and so do i and i would like to be your friend to if you will let me i mean you obviously have friends if like 7 people left comments calling me an asshole and saying that they will be there for you if you need them. well im out if you need me ill be here

He still wants her back.  He still loves her.  He will do anything to save her.  The only reason he is not with her is because of her parents.
And why the hell aren't I in there?  I guess this has just made me realize that I am some cheap replacement for her.  I can't do this anymore.  I hate this pain, I had forgotten how much it hurts.  
Aaron, how can you be ready for a relationship?  This whole weekend you were completely detached from me...Thinking about Michele nonetheless.  You cried because she knows about us...I never knew we were suppose to be kept a secret from her.  If you are trying to get over her, why didn't you tell her about us in the first place? Maybe because you don't actually want to get over her.  
The worst part of it all is you are thinking about how you are hurting Michele and NOT how you are hurting me.
You don't care for me the way I care for you, that much is clear.  I'm not thinking about getting back with my ex within a year or so...Because you don't do that when you are going out with someone else.  Basically, I don't stand a chance next to her.  Even if I do now, in a year I won't.  So what the fuck is my purpose?  I'm just a space filler for the time being...Someone you can fuck and use for support.  
If we haven't even gone out for a month, and this is how I feel already, then this is not a good sign.  Where do you think we will be on May 27th?  I don't think we will be together, I think you will go back to her.  You will do anything to save her, so why not go back to her if that is what she so desperately wants?  
This whole thing is so frustrating because I CAN'T TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT.  Otherwise, he will be upset because he has to think about Michele and the pain she is experiencing that is NOT his fault.
And once again, you've put another knife into my heart."

Friday - Babysat, ran a bunch of errands with Aaron, then to Van Helsing with Aaron, Frank, Ryan and Keri.
Saturday - Mall for my mom's present, gym by myself, work, babysat my cousin Joe for about 20 minutes, then to the mall again with Aaron, Frank, Ryan, and Keri.
Today - Went to the ER because I definately cannot stand my UTI anymore, out to breakfast with the mother, then to blockbuster so my mom and I could watch movies.  
And now I have to do homework!  So much homework.  Ah ah ah ah ah!
I'm really worried about Aaron, mostly because of Michele and Elsa.  I didn't get enough time with him this weekend...
Prom is this Saturday.  My mom better let me sleep over Christina's.  I will freak out if she doesn't.

So much anger towards him right now that I'm just going to drop the subject entirely.
Today I was abused so bad.  I was bitten, punched, kicked, scratched, pretty much anything you can think of.  I'm in a lot of pain right now, not to mention that I think I have a UTI.  Ahhhhhh!  It burns so frigin bad.
I ate so many french fries today, I feel H U G E.  Aaron came to visit me at work for like 30 seconds...But hey, better than nothing, right?  Whenever I see him, no matter how bad of a mood I am in, I just smile right away and forget about everything.  That hasn't happened to me in years.

I don't think I am going to school on Thursday.  Not only do I have this mother of a latin test first period, but I have gym long block.  Aerobics long block is something I will enjoy missing.  Plus, I have this huge philosophy paper due on Friday that I need to stay home and work on.  
Aaron and I are hanging out on Friday, something to look forward to.  And I'm sure we will be hanging out on Saturday and Sunday too...
Today sucked.  School sucked, when I got home it sucked.  I wanted to sleep but I decided to talk to Christina and then get some homework done that I have been putting off for so long.  I was thinking about taking a run today, but then I thought of the may flies, and I decided against it.  Being eaten alive by little annoying bugs is not exactly enjoyable.
Tomorrow will be a sweatpants day I believe.  I have to get up early so I can go into school at 7 to work on this stupid history project.  Gr, I hate my group...Our project was due last Friday and we aren't done.
I. Want. A. Vacation.  Or at least to get away for a few days.  I'm never stressed, I don't know why I am now.  Nothing is really different...Actually a lot is different - Boyfriend, job, dad is leaving, gym, not doing homework until the last second.  Yea, that would just about cause the stress.

You've always shown love through what you could buy.
You always thought you bought me off, but you didn't.
I didn't want the money, I wanted a father.
Sitting here, the anger festers, it grows and grows.
You moved away, you don't call, you don't care.

I guess I was ignorant to think that you had a heart.
All I wanted was a father, not some darkened enemy.

I finally realized that you mean nothing to me,
You don't even deserve the title of my father.
What have you ever done for me?  Besides the fucking money?
We used to be the best of friends, just my dad and I.
How blind could I have been?  It was all just a facade.
Daddy just felt guilty because he nearly ruined my life,
The drinking, the yelling, the lonely nights.
I grew up too fast for even myself and it wasn't fair,
My childhood has many pictures, but all without you there.
Forgiveness is far too lost for you now,
I should never have been exposed to this at all.
Things are never the way they should be
But for some reason we're always smiling, pretending
That everything is okay.  But it never is and never was.
Why is it that I have never been completely happy?
Maybe because it was you.  You left a huge gap in my life.
I never learned the things a father tells his daughter,
No trips just by ourselves.  No trips anywhere.
You don't even deserve the title of my father.
I am already twice the person you have even been.
You moved away, you don't call, you don't care.
You have never apologized for failing me,
You have never apologized for nearly ruining me,
You have never been there when I need you.

Things will actually be easier in some ways.  No more cleaning up after him, he won't be home at random times when I don't want him to...But I feel bad for my mom.  She is having a really hard time with money at the moment and with Robert gone, that's an extra $1200 she doesn't have every month.  But I know she will be happier with him gone.  I'm willing to sacrifice things so it will be easier on her.  Especially since I've got a job now...I won't depend on her for money so much.
Anyways.  I've had a great time by myself tonight.  I babysat til 5 and then I went to the mall until 8.  I got workout clothes and prom stuff.  I had a blast laughing at all the girls talking in Spanish to each other, and at the kids who thought I was checking them out.  They were so ugly...They were wiggers...And they followed me around for like 10 mintues.  It was actually kind of scary.
Tomorrow is not going to be fun...Well at least until 12:30.  That's when the SATs end.  Then Christina and I are going out to breakfast and then to the gym.  And we get to spend all day together!  I feel bad though because Aaron wants me to go to Frank's house, but there will be much drinking.  And if I am around it, I will do it.  So basically...I'm not going because I don't want to be put in a situation where I might drink and drive.  I'm sure it is good that I don't go, but I still feel bad.
Going into Aaron deprevation again.  It's only been a day.  I can't see him probably until Sunday.  Not good.  Not good at all.  We were going to go out soon, but that doesn't seem like the case anymore.  He's afraid that if he is depressed it will get in the way of things...Make me feel bad, ect.  The whole situation sucks...I just want to be with him.  I don't care when or how, but I want us to be together.  I'm going to wait for him, it's not a problem.  Things just never go the way they should.  I guess I'm just a little disappointed.  But I'll deal with it, it will be worth it in the end."

"event","So Aaron has a ""surprise"" for me...It is white, does not cost any amount of money, and he has never owned it before.  If anyone has any ideas what it is - Tell me!!!  
Anyways, today was alright I guess.  School sucked as usual.  
I found out today that I am going to be all alone on Friday night.  Christina and gang are going to the APC concert that I wanted to go to, but I'm not.  Aaron and Andy are working late.  Looks like it a me and Johnny night.  I don't really mind being alone though, I haven't had time to myself since before vacation.  So I will just look at the bright side of it and have fun by myself (and Johnny).
I just called McDonalds, and I think I have a job there.  That was the last place that I wanted to work...But it is the only place that I can find.  So I will just have to deal with it. 
Tonight I am chilling with Aaron.  I am in like Aaron-deprevation right now...It's been almost 3 days since I have seen him!  ::slowly dies::
I've got to go and give Minnie her medicine...She isn't getting any better =("

I just got home 5 minutes ago, and I have all of these chores to do with absolutely no time.  I've got my SAT thing tonight and the gym.  Good thing I don't have any homework tonight.  Otherwise I would be screwed.
I probably won't be home tonight until 9 either.  All I want to do is sleep!  I am so tired...Maybe the gym will wake me up.  Ahhhh!  Must go, mother is going to rip my head off in...3...2...1."

"event","The lonely spider walks over to the grave,
And spins her web over what she cannot save.
The memories she had, the heartbreak she bleed,
Her legs were broken with the lies she was fed.
The blackest spider I ever did know,
Mourns on the inside yet it never shows,
That her webs mean nothing, she only lives for the prey,
And the thought of getting to see him again one day.
Spider, spider down on her knees,
Begging for someone to kill her please.
The life she leads she knows has no purpose,
When she finally found her way to the surface.
Hidden in the darkest corner she could find,
All alone, playing pretend in her mind.
Thoughts of laughter, smiles, and no need for hiding,
She feels all the tension in her legs subsiding.
But the coldness of the grave brings her back,
To remind her of all the things that she lacks.
The web comes undone, she falls to the grave,
And now she is the one that no one can save."

Normally all of this would have been done by now, but I haven't had 2 hours where I wasn't either out somewhere, with someone at my house, or sleeping.  
Today I went to the gym, went grocery shopping for my mom and had this strange black guy hit on me, and then Aaron came over.  We played Monopoly, and what a surprise he won!  Then we went to Friendly's and watched Ace Ventura (best movie ever).
Good news: Christina and I talked, FINALLY.  She said she will try harder to limit Richie time and make more room for friends.  I hope she follows through with it, because I know how easy it is just to fall right back into it.  I have faith in my woman though.
Tomorrow = school = 6 in the morning = death.  I don't want vacation to end, it has been like the best 10 days of my life.  Not so much, but it's still been good.
After prom Christina is having a sleepover with everyone.  It is going to be SO much fun.  Aaron did not get the light blue tux, thank my non-existent god!  I would have died, literally.
Well, time for me to do something productive (maybe)."

"event","In 43 minutes, it will be the last day of vacation.  Shoot me now.  I have this gigantic stack of homework that I haven't even look at yet...But at least I have to get up early anyway to go to the gym with Christina.
Today I came home from my dad's at like 3...Car ride of death.  Then I went over to Aaron's.  It was fun, then boring, then fun, the boring, then really fun.  We had issues thinking of things to do since I couldn't go to the cemetery with him and his friends.  I felt really bad because I wanted him to have a good time.  I was ready to leave so he could go to the cemetery, but he ended up talking me out of it.  So we went to the carnival again...Went on this awful ride that made me sick.  Went to the mall for like 5 minutes, then his car for like an hour.  
We both decided to take back the rules he put into place.  It was so funny...We tried so hard for like two days and then it all ended up where it was before.  I know we aren't going out, but before I guess he thought it seemed like it...Or he thought he was sending off the wrong message by doing stuff.  But it's all just the same because whether or not we do stuff I still feel the same way...And either way I know we aren't together.  Which is fine.
Tomorrow will be a much needed conversation with Christina.  I hope it all goes well.  Which I am sure it will...Things like this have happened before and we've worked through them together.
This vacation has been so crazy.  I loved it.  Driving makes so much of a difference in my life, I can do what I want with who I want.  I have been like non-stop, even when I was at my dad's.  It sucks though, tomorrow after the gym...HOMEWORK!  ::hides in corner::"

I actually don't feel too bad that I missed it.  I ended up watching a Johnny Depp movie with the family so the time went by faster than expected.  And I made brownies, that was fun.
I get to go home tomorrow!  And chill with Aaron!  Funness.  Hopefully my mom won't be gay and want to spend time with me.  I really need to get out and have fun.  
As for Christina...I got online right now to see if she was on.  But she's sleeping.  I really want to talk to her about the way I've been feeling, along with other people.  I don't know though, I might wait for her to bring it up.  Either way the conversation is coming soon.  Her and I are going to the gym on Sunday, that might be the time...
I cannot wait to go see my therapist.  I usually don't have anything too important to talk about...But right now the list is growing every minute:

1) Father = not paying for college = asshole
2) Need outside advice about Aaron since I don't want to talk to my mom about it
3) What to do about Christina
4) The drinking happening more frequently at my dad's
5) How for the past week I've been sad =(

I could add more, but those are the major things.  I'm going to go lie in bed and listen to music and hope I fall asleep.  Night."

I talked to Aaron until 3 in the morning last night, that didn't even cheer me up.  It's like that Blink-182 song, Stay Together For The Kids: ""This house is haunted, it's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all.""  I fucking hate being here.  I've called up everyone and no one is home =( No one is around to take my mind off of things.
Usually shopping makes me feel better, I spent so much too.  But it didn't.  I think I needed to spend more.  Yea...All alone tonight.  Something to look forward too.  Or not.
Tomorrow will be a better day.  I'm going home at like 3 and hopefully Aaron and I are still hanging out.  He went over Michele's today =( Made me sad, but it's okay.  It's not like he and I have anything with eachother so I shouldn't even let it be known that I was sad.  He can do what he wants, obviously.  So yea, I'm just going to shut-up about it before I dig myself into a hole.
All my dad and my step-mother ever do is fight.  It's so upsetting to me.  They used to be so happy together.  That is up until my dad lost his job.  Now that they don't have all the money in the world anymore they just yell at each other.  It's not even like the fighting has to do with anything important...It's stupid shit.  Like she forgot to get milk at the store.  I'm so sick of listening to it and it's only been a day.
Once again Christina isn't home.  I really needed to talk to someone today...But guess not.  Guess not anyone.  Andy isn't even home.
I don't feel like writing anymore, it's not helping."

"event","Here at my dad's.  I can't sleep so I decided to write.  I don't feel like talking to anyone either, otherwise I'd be on aim.  But yea, not in a good mood.
Today was just depressing.  I applied to about 6 different places for jobs...And then my dad came and picked me up.  We went out to dinner and he had people sing Happy Birthday to me (I hated it).  He gave me my present...money (so personal).  Then the hour car ride home was just total silence.  He didn't ask any questions about how I'm doing, how my friends are doing, how things are going.  He just drove home with me in the back on the verge of tears.  But I didn't cry and I still haven't.  I'm trying to turn my sadness into anger towards him.  I am never going to forgive him if he doesn't help pay for college.  
Yea, tomorrow going shopping at this ghetto mall in Springfield.  And then I get to be here at my dad's while everyone is out having fun.  It wouldn't even bother me, it's just I haven't seen Christina or really talked to her in like four days.  Everyime I call her she isn't home.  I talk to her mom more than I talk to her.  
I know Christina and Richie are like inseparable and I don't want to get inbetween them at all.  I am very happy for them...It's just that all of her friends are getting left behind, and so are Richie's friends.  This is exactly what I did when I was going out with Craig, and I lost so many friends.  So many.  If I could go back and redo it, I wouldn't think twice about it.  I just don't want Christina to lose her friends because of Richie.  Every waking moment she is either with him, talking to him on the phone, writing him notes, talking to him online, or is very detached because she is thinking about him.
Like the time I went to the movies with them, or the time when we all went out to dinner with his mom...Death.  I was so annoyed because whenever she was talking to me I knew she wanted to be talking to Richie more.  I don't like being around them at all.  It's great that they are all happy, but I'm not the only one who thinks that it is a little too much.  When they are together it is like impossible to get a word in.  I get so frustrated that it pushes me away from my best friend.  You know, I don't even know if I could call her a best friend - We see eachother maybe 2 times a month, and I'm lucky if every week I get an hour of phone time.  These are her decisions...And I just want her to be happy, which is with Richie.  But I just see what I went through with ""the love of my life"" and it didn't end well...Basically because I was left with no friends in the end."

Although, because Christina and I were like the only attractive girls there we got into all the rides for free...Only AFTER we payed for tickets.  Then I got sick from too many spinny rides.
Things with Aaron weren't too good.  I thought he was with those 8th graders at the beginning, and I mean, why would I want to be around that?  So Christina and I just chilled alone.  Which was probably a good idea, otherwise I would have been in a bad mood all night.  But after like the first hour it was good.  He and I were being the way we usually are.
Today was my birthday!!!  I had the best time ever.  My mom and I went shopping for SO long, like 10 to 4.  I finally found a prom dress...It took us that long to decide on one.  But it's good, it's pink =).  Anyways, then Aaron came over.  We played chess, haha.  ANd he got to be there for my birthday thing with my mom and Robert.  Then we watched the movie he got me, Johnny Depp of course.  
Tomorrow is going to be G A Y.  I have to get up at 4:30 so that I can go into work with my mom.  I get to follow around a pharmacist all day.  I am going to die.
Wednesday I think I'm going shopping with Sarah and Katie.  With my non-existent money.  Actually, by then I should have money from my birthday.  This weekend I have to go to my dad's.  SO MUCH DEATH!  Way to ruin a perfectly good vacation, the bastard."

Tomorrow is UCONN.  So much death.
I babysat today too.  It was so easy, all he did was watch a Mary-Kate and Ashely movie.  Although, it was very painful to have to sit there and watch those two idiots and their idiot friends.  But hey, I must say that it beats getting hit in the face with heavy objects.

There was this ridiculous 20 year old guy who was showing us how to use the machines...It was the best time ever.  It was so obvious he was into us, it was hilarious.  I am so happy I'm going to the gym, best decision I could have made.
I have NO plans for tomorrow.  It will be the first day of vacation and I won't be doing ANYTHING.  No good.  No good at all.  Hopefully Christina will be able to do something.
Saturday I have to go to UCONN, all day.  It's going to suck.  Open houses for colleges are always so boring.
Sunday Christina and I are going shopping and then to Shbooms and then she is sleeping over.  Going to be a great time.
Monday is my birthday!  Can't wait to be 17.  Can get into R movies, FINALLY.  I don't know...I have a feeling my birthday is not going to be a happy one.
Speaking of not being happy, for the past couple of days I've been unusually upset.  I mean I cried in school yesterday, that never happens to me.  I cried because I was thinking of my step-mother this past weekend.  Today I wasn't really happy either.  My mom has this awful additude towards me, it's very hurtful.  I can't even talk to her about anything right now because she just makes me feel stupid.  
Oh, by the way, going to prom with Aaron.  Should be fun, hopefully nothing happens inbetween then and now though (Don't count on it)."

"event","Today everyone was sober again.  They put on a smile and pretend like it never happened.  They think that if they don't talk about it, then maybe it will go away.  Whatever, I'm back at my mom's again.  Waiting for Christina to come over.
I was supposed to chill with Aaron, but that never happened.  It's okay though, I ended up sleeping and going shopping.  Tomorrow is Easter...And I think I am going to be all by myself from the looks of it.  Aaron and I are supposed to get together, but I don't know if that is going to happen.  That's my life though, alone when I shouldn't be.
My mom is drunk tonight.  She usually doesn't drink, but when she does she is so unbelievable annoying.  I hope she just goes right to bed when she gets home tonight.  
I'm sad =( There are no kitties anywhere!!!  So Laura doesn't get a new cat =( I have to keep waiting for one, and I'm getting very impatient.
I had a cigarette today for the first time in months.  I loved it.  When I'm stressed out, I crave them so bad.  I stole some last night from my step-mother.  I know that I shouldn't have but I couldn't hold it back any longer.  I can say I won't get addicted again, but I don't know if that is true or not."

"event","Alcoholism.  The worst disease I've ever been exposed to.  
My step-mother has been an alcoholic ever since I can remember.  From about the age of 4 to the age of 12 I cannot remember a time where she wasn't drunk.  She's been getting help for the last 3 or 4 years now.  She usually does well not drinking and all, but sometimes she falls back into it.
Just like tonight.  She's been drunk since about noon...And my dad decided to join in with her.  Lovely.  He even brought me with him this time to the package store, just what I needed.  
My step-mother and my dad are outside right now having a camp fire.  And guess who gets to watch Amy?  Me.  As usual.  I hate it when things are like this.  It's so frustrating.  I don't understand it either...Well I understand that my step-mother is an alcoholic and she really can't help it.  But I don't understand why everytime she gets drunk that my dad has to join in.  It's some sort of fucked-up cycle.  And it fucking affects me more than they could ever know.
I love my step-mother when she isn't drunk.  She is the nicest and most caring person.  But when she is drunk, she doesn't even realize that she isn't a totally different person.  She can't stand straight and she is usually very angry and easily upset.  I hate being around her.  It reminds me of how I didn't have a childhood.
Childhood....Memories of being all alone since I was about 10 with my sister who has down-syndrome.  Memories of not having food, and having to feed me and my sister with random things in the pantry.  Memories of scary car rides with a drunk driver.  Memories of being embarrased to bring friends over.  Memories of me crying until they came home.  Memories of me going to therapy because it fucked me up so much.
I'm over the being fucked-up part.  I've forgiven my father and my step-mother.  But I still hurt everytime she drinks.  I wouldn't be able to deal with it if she fell back into her old habits of drinking 24/7.  Not to mention that she has Hepatitis C.  It doesn't even matter how much her drinking affects me...A lot of what bothers me is that she very well might drink herself to death.
Alcoholism.  Seems like a harmless disease, but it's not."

"event","I'm at my dad's...Lovely.  My dad decided to have a talk with me that I've been too bitchy lately.  What the hell is that?  For a while now I have been happy...and all of a sudden he thinks I am going to be depressed again just because I was bitchy.  You get bitchy sometimes too, thank you very much.
I got so much sleep last night, like 15 hours.  It was heaven.  I'm wide awake and sooo hyper, but there is nothing for me to do here when I can get out my hyperness.  I wish I was at my mom's this weekend, I would of had the car the whole entire time.  Grrr.  Oh well, at least I don't have to do anything until tomorrow when I leave my dad's.
I don't even know what to say about Aaron.  So I won't say anything.
My birthday is in 10 days!!!  I can't wait...I don't know what I should for it though.  I doubt I'll have a party because my house isn't a good place for one.
Well, Spongebob is calling me..."

"event","About to leave for my dad's...So much fun, not.  At least I have things to look forward to when I get back though.  Christina is sleeping over on Saturday night and Aaron and I are chillen on Sunday.  At least I get 2 days at my dad's just to be lazy and hopefully do nothing.
I joined the Y today!!!  Christina joined yesterday.  I am so psyched!  It's going to be so fun going with her, it will take my mind off having to actually exercise, even though I don't really mind it.  But yea, definately a good birthday present.  
I'm not going to Slipknot anymore =( Frigin Mike decides he wants to wait outside the Palladium for SEVEN hours.  That definately did not fly with my mom, or with me.  7 hours?  What the hell were we going to do for 7 hours?  Not to mention it is a horrible neighborhood and I don't really want to get shot or raped any time soon.
If anyone wants to call me and save me from boredom this weekend, call my cell...PLEASE."

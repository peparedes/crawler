"event","Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daugter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
But will pray for her.
I will call her name out loud.
I would bleed for her.
If I could only see her now.

Living on a razors edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a rasors edge."

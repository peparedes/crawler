"event","Wow...I've updated a lot lately.  I blame it on having lots of time to kill in class, and running out of other amusements.

I heard <i>Wintereisse</i> at Symphony Center on Wed. night.  It was pleasantly depressing.  Last night I went to a federalist society party.  It was unpleasantly depressing, as one might expect from the federalist society.

Today is Mia's birthday, and I have nothing planned tonight.  Nothing at all.  Nada.  Zilch.  I probably should work, but that's nothing new.  I was thinking of making a trip to Ann Arbor this weekend, but it won't happen, as I have plans tomorrow night and Sunday.  Thoughts on amusements, anyone?"

Firstly, I'm having a bit of trouble really focusing on my classes.  This is problematic, since I am taking mostly reading-intensive classes, 3 of which are lectures on basic substantive law.

Secondly, myself and Mia are back together, albeit still open.  We just missed/loved eachother too much.  Disturbing, no?  She found herself unable to have sex with other people, something which discombobulated her greatly.  Meanwhile, I don't think I'll be seeing Amber again...I haven't spoken to her in just under a week.  'tis a pity, as I enjoyed talking to her, but just as well.  There are two others I might casually date, but I'm seeing Mia for Valentine's day, and we'll see where things go from there...she may well also be coming with me to San Francisco this spring (March 21-28).

Thirdly, I'm going to be in Houston February 26-29th.  I'll be visiting a friend working there, but I'll have lots of free time to hang out and explore.

Fourthly, I'd like to welcome my friend Jackie to the readership of this journal.

"event","Mia is going to be training, it seems, under what can only be called a blowhard.  These brings about deeply negative feelings, most of which are deeply irrational, but such it is.

The fellow in question is in his mid-50s, with 4 girls already, and apparently some professional BDSM experience.  Basically, his specialty is luring and training ex-housewives - Mia is quite a bit younger than any of the other girls.  I have no doubt that his skill in this game are superior to mine (those who know me know that this makes me stew, as I despise not being superior, but given that he has quite a few years of experience, I am not surprised).  Mia sent me some of his philosophy, as it were, and I can only call it horseshit.  But she does have a weakness for this kind of horseshit, as I have seen in the past.  If I really couldn't stand her doing this, I'd take her back.  But I can't allow that just yet - there is a reason we ended it, no matter how irrational / idiotic it seems at certain moments.

Meanwhile, I am going on a date with A tonight.  I'm looking forward to it...she's smart, witty, and good looking, with a healthy dose of whimsy and strangeness.  I'll report more in time."

We later discussed the American Revolution, and mutually reached the conclusion that the reason it could only occur after the enlightenment because prior to the enlightenment, in the dark ages of deus ex machina, causation and thus philosophical justification therof did not exist in human hands.

[begin]
The imminent emergence of the eminent 
T.H.O.N.G.
Topless Humans Organized for Natural Genetics.

""putting our bodies between your mouths and biotech""

****something insidious is inside you. dulling your
senses.  sapping your energy.  stealing your sex
drive.  changing your cellular makeup to fit its
design.  it's happening all around you.  every day. on
every corner.  at every meal.

AND YOU'RE CONVINCED IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
it's biotech.
and it's bad.

breathe deeply, open your minds and 
mouths and get a taste of
T.H.O.N.G.

THONG opposes biotechnology and the elements of
culture that create and use it. 
THONG targets these social and culinary criminals
(like Kraft) through topless performative direct
action.
THONG creates and disseminates THONG CULTURE- a
sustainable, sexy, organic, creative, brilliant,
grassroots, gorgeous, anti-oppresive,
boundary-breaking, whirlwind of experience.

Come for the food.
Stay to get naked.

Organic is hot.

My primary comment is that parts of this sound eerily similar to General Ripper from Dr. Strangelove.  However, Mr. Ted had two much better comments:
""Art is often the refuge of the inarticulate""
""They probably shouldn't be on ecstacy when writing promotional text""

Some of my few readers may take umbrage at my not thinking well of this.  That's what comments are for...

At least they have one thing in their favor...someone has already written their song."

"event","""In headaches and in worry
   Vaguely life leaks away,
And Time will have his fancy
   To-morrow or to-day.

""Into many a green valley
   Drifts the appalling snow;
Time breaks the threaded dances
   And the diver's brilliant bow.

""O plunge your hands in water,
   Plunge them in up to the wrist;
Stare, stare in the basin
   And wonder what you've missed.

""The glacier knocks in the cupboard,
   The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup opens
   A lane to the land of the dead.

""Where the beggars raffle the banknotes
   And the Giant is enchanting to Jack,
And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,
   And Jill goes down on her back.

""O look, look in the mirror?
   O look in your distress:
Life remains a blessing
   Although you cannot bless.

""O stand, stand at the window
   As the tears scald and start;
You shall love your crooked neighbour
   With your crooked heart.""

It was late, late in the evening,
   The lovers they were gone;
The clocks had ceased their chiming,
   And the deep river ran on.

Thus ends W.H. Auden's poem ""As I Walked Out One Evening"" (You can find the whole thing <a href=""http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/auden/poem.html"">here</a>).  It has always been one of my favorite poems, and lately I've been feeling it more.  Perhaps 'tis a quarter-life crisis.

Myself and all my friends from way back are entering adult life.  One is off to med school, another to Hollywood, et al.  I myself am living on my own, seeing a girl who it is becoming increasingly obvious I will go the distance with, and in professional school.  Is the twilight of youth a career services office?

To boot, the whole job rush now is taking a toll.  One intruiging aspect of freedom is that in a sense, it reduces freedom.  3 choices are far more manageable than 50, especially when the criteria seperating them are fairly inscrutable.

The final fact is that I simply don't care.  No-one knows why I'm in Law School, save that I couldn't think of anything better to do my parents would pay for.  I'm pulling a decent GPA, though hardly superlative, and I don't think I qualified for any journals, although such cannot be concluded at this point.  I have ideas that I could turn into greatness, but I hold myself back.  For years I have seen things with a clarity few others can approach, but I cannot bring myself to interact with my observations.

For some of you, this may be a vaguely disturbing look at my more human side.  c'est la vie."

"event","It occurred to me today that the notion of promiscuity exists, in large part, for females to exert sexual control.  The notion of female promiscuity (and such associated notions as virginity) discourages many women from being sexually active, and thus to remove themselves from the sexual market.  Meanwhile, male promiscuity is tacitly encouraged in our society, Thus meaning that few males exempt themselves from the sexual market.  The end result is fewer women than men by a significant margin on the sexual margin, and thus handing control over the females by virtue of their being able to pick and choose.  Meanwhile, marriage acts as a control on the other end of the spectrum.  Such concepts do indeed bind women to certain roles, but one should not think that women are the only ones disadvantaged by the concept of female promiscuity as a negative.

Please no comments on exceptions.  This is a gross generalization, and one that seems only applicable to heterosexual relationships.  Other comments are more than welcome."

**************************************************************
I'm so sick of arming the world, then sending troops over to destroy the fucking arms, you know what I mean? We keep arming these little countries, then we go and blow the shit out of them. We're like the bullies of the world, y'know. We're like Jack Palance in the movie Shane, throwing the pistol at the sheepherder's feet.
""Pick it up.""
""I don't wanna pick it up, Mister, you'll shoot me.""
""Pick up the gun.""
""Mister, I don't want no trouble. I just came downtown here to get some hard rock candy for my kids, some gingham for my wife. I don't even know what gingham is, but she goes through about ten rolls a week of that stuff. I ain't looking for no trouble, Mister.""
""Pick up the gun.""
(He picks it up. Three shots ring out.)
""You all saw him - he had a gun.""
**************************************************************
I smoke. If this bothers anyone, I suggest you look around at the world in which we live and shut your fuckin' mouth.
**************************************************************
Watching television is like taking black spray paint to your third eye.
**************************************************************
People are bringing shotguns to UFO sightings in Fife, Alabama. I asked a guy, ""Why do you bring a gun to a UFO sighting?"" Guy said, ""Way-ul, we didn' wanna be ab-duc-ted."" If I lived in Fife, Alabama, I would be on my hands and knees every night praying for abduction.
**************************************************************
""This is your brain."" I've seen a lot of weird shit on drugs. I have never ever ever ever EVER looked at a fucking egg and thought it was a brain.
**************************************************************
If you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, then go home and burn all your records, all your tapes, and all your CDs because every one of those artists who have made brilliant music and enhanced your lives? RrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrEAL fucking high on drugs. The Beatles were so fucking high they let Ringo sing a few songs.
**************************************************************
The musicians today who don't do drugs and in fact speak out against it? ""Rock Against Drugs?"" BOY do they suck.
**************************************************************
I have never seen two people on pot get in a fight because it is fucking IMPOSSIBLE. ""Hey, buddy!"" ""Hey, what?"" ""Ummmmmmm...."" End of argument.
**************************************************************
We gotta come to some new ideas about life folks ok? I'm not being blase about abortion, it might be a real issue, it might not, doesn't matter to me. What matters is that if you believe in the sanctity of life then you believe it for life of all ages. That's what I hate about this child-worship syndrome going on. ""Save the children! They're killing children! How many children were at Waco? They're killing children!"" What does that mean? They reach a certain age and they're off your fucking love-list? Fuck your children, if that's the way you think then fuck you too. You either love all people of all ages or you shut the fuck up.
**************************************************************
Because you know if you play New Kids on the Block albums backwards they sound better. ""Oh come on, Bill, they're the New Kids, don't pick on them, they're so good and they're so clean cut and they're such a good image for the children."" Fuck that! When did mediocrity and banality become a good image for your children? I want my children to listen to people who fucking ROCKED! I don't care if they died in puddles of their own vomit! I want someone who plays from his fucking HEART!
**************************************************************
I was in Nashville, Tennesee last year. After the show I went to a Waffle House. I'm not proud of it, I was hungry. And I'm alone, I'm eating and I'm reading a book, right? Waitress walks over to me: ""<smack smack smack smack> Hey, whatchoo readin' for?""
Isn't that the weirdest fucking question you've ever heard? Not what am I readING, but what am I reading *for*? Well, godammit, ya stumped me! Why do I read? Well... hmmm... I dunno... I guess I read for a lot of reasons, and the main one is so I don't end up being a fucking waffle waitress.
**************************************************************
Supreme Court says pornography is anything without artistic merit that causes sexual thoughts, that's their definition, essentially. No artistic merit, causes sexual thoughts. Hmm... Sounds like...every commercial on television, doesn't it? You know, when I see those two twins on that Doublemint commercial? I'm not thinking of gum. I am thinking of chewing, so maybe that's the connection they're trying to make.
**************************************************************
Here is my final point. About drugs, about alcohol, about pornography and smoking and everything else. What business is it of yours what I do, read, buy, see, say, think, who I fuck, what I take into my body - as long as I do not harm another human being on this planet?
**************************************************************
Why is marijuana against the law? It grows naturally upon our planet. Doesn't the idea of making nature against the law seem to you a bit... unnatural? You know what I mean? It's nature. How do you make nature against the fucking law?
**************************************************************
I can speak for every guy in this room here tonight. Guys, if you could blow yourselves, ladies, you'd be in this room alone right now. Watching an empty stage.
**************************************************************
I dunno how much AIDS scares y'all, but I got a theory: the day they come out with a cure for AIDS, a guaranteed one-shot cure, on that day there's gonna be fucking in the streets, man.
**************************************************************
They lie about marijuana. Tell you pot-smoking makes you unmotivated. Lie! When you're high, you can do everything you normally do, just as well. You just realize that it's not worth the fucking effort. There is a difference.
**************************************************************
You ever noticed how people who believe in Creationism look really unevolved? You ever noticed that? Eyes real close together, eyebrow ridges, big furry hands and feet. ""I believe God created me in one day"" Yeah, looks liked He rushed it.
**************************************************************
I love talking about the Kennedy assasination. The reason I do is because I'm fascinated by it. I'm fascinated that our government could lie to us so blatantly, so obviously for so long, and we do absolutely nothing about it. I think that's interesting in what is ostensibly a democracy. Sarcasm - come on in. People say ""Bill, quit talking about Kennedy man. It was a long time ago, just let it go, alright? It's a long time ago, just forget it."" I'm like, alright, then don't bring up Jesus to me. As long as we're talking shelf life here...
**************************************************************
No, I don't do drugs anymore, either. But I'll tell you something about drugs. I used to do drugs, but I'll tell you something honestly about drugs, honestly, and I know it's not a very popular idea, you don't hear it very often anymore, but it is the truth: I had a great time doing drugs. Sorry. Never murdered anyone, never robbed anyone, never raped anyone, never beat anyone, never lost a job, a car, a house, a wife or kids, laughed my ass off, and went about my day.
**************************************************************
Christianity has a built-in defense system: anything that questions a belief, no matter how logical the argument is, is the work of Satan by the very fact that it makes you question a belief. It's a very interesting defense mechanism and the only way to get by it -- and believe me, I was raised Southern Baptist -- is to take massive amounts of mushrooms, sit in a field, and just go, ""Show me.""
**************************************************************

I've learned a lot about women. I think I've learned exactly how the fall of man occured in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, and Adam said one day, ""Wow, Eve, here we are, at one with nature, at one with God, we'll never age, we'll never die, and all our dreams come true the instant that we have them."" And Eve said, ""Yeah... it's just not enough is it?""

Fundamentalist Christianity - fascinating. These people actually believe that the the world is 12,000 years old. Swear to God. Based on what? I asked them.
""Well we looked at all the people in the Bible and we added 'em up all the way back to Adam and Eve, their ages: 12,000 years.""
Well how fucking scientific, okay. I didn't know that you'd gone to so much trouble. That's good. You believe the world's 12,000 years old?
""That's right.""
Okay, I got one word to ask you, a one word question, ready?
""Uh-huh.""
Dinosaurs.
You know the world is 12,000 years old and dinosaurs existed, they existed in that time, you'd think it would have been mentioned in the fucking Bible at some point.
""And lo Jesus and the disciples walked to Nazareth. But the trail was blocked by a giant brontosaurus... with a splinter in his paw. And O the disciples did run a shriekin': 'What a big fucking lizard, Lord!' But Jesus was unafraid and he took the splinter from the brontosaurus's paw and the big lizard became his friend.
""And Jesus sent him to Scotland where he lived in a loch for O so many years inviting thousands of American tourists to bring their fat fucking families and their fat dollar bills.
""And oh Scotland did praise the Lord. Thank you Lord, thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.""

I laid in a field of green grass for four hours, going, 'My God, I love everything.'

First of all, let me tell you something real quick. The very idea that anyone could be my boss, well...I think you see the conflict. Not in this lifetime, Charlie. A few more incarnations, we'll sit down and chat. But I used to always get harassed. 

'Hicks, how come you're not working.' 
I'd go, 'There's nothing to do.' 
'Well, you pretend like you're working.' 
'Well, why don't you pretend I'm working? Yeah, you get paid more than me, you fantasize. Pretend I'm mopping. Knock yourself out. I'll pretend they're buying stuff; we can close up. I'm the boss now, you're fired. How's that? I'm on a fucking roll. We're all millionaires and you're dick. I'm pretending shit, I'm wacky, I can't be stopped.'

""The world is like a ride at an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it, you think that it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question - is this real, or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered, and they come back to us. They say 'Hey! Don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because, this is just a ride.' And we...kill those people. Ha ha ha. 'Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride. SHUT HIM UP! Look at my furrows of worry. Look at my big bank account and family. This just has to be real.' It's just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok. But it doesn't matter because: it's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings, and money. A choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourselves off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here's what you can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money that we spend on weapons and defense each year, and instead spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, for ever, in peace.""

Made me kinda sad tho seeing the homeless kitties and made me miss mine that I am so far from now...

Also it reminded me of a kitty by our apartments I saw that was hit by a car today.

I am sure most people don't pay much attention to stray cats such as that but it always makes me think when I see them. Wondering what their life was like and what kind of personality they had and if they had a loving home at some point.

Hope my cats are warm and doing well...

Well after all that getting my hopes up for having my machine on my long break, customs crushed that dream = (.

Apparently my package got stuck in Indianapolis at customs after it came from Shanghai where it was customized and went to Anchorage and did not move for a whole day in ID because apparently customs did not work till evening on Friday, which I found out after I called FedEx.

So Friday night it shipped immediately after customs started working which made me pissed because it they had started work in the afternoon I would have my package by now. So as of Saturday in the early morning it made it to Oakland and then said it left the FedEx facility there and the ETA of Friday now says nothing which is just dandy.

So now I must wait till tomorrow to get it and I know I will be so busy this week at work and tired from that and my commute that once I get home I wont have the time nor the sanity to do much with it till next weekend... Sigh, what a bunch of crap!

Ah well, at least I will know it will be safe and delivered by tomorrow. I'll be sure and snap some shots of the first opening tomorrow...

But I can certainly be thankful for the great 4 1/2 day break I just had. I did not do much, but not doing much for me is heaven as the weekdays are usually a little chaotic. It was good to have a lot of time to sleep in and relax with family. Hope everyone else had a great one as well!

I just felt since I have been hearing so much about this topic I should post something.

It's really sad to see someone like that but amazing that he can go through daily activities still and not just want to give up and stop taking drugs to control that.

I donno how strong I would be if I was in his situation.

Also for the people bad mouthing him and saying he is faking it and crap, you should be fucking ashamed of yourselves.

The guy obviously is taking meds and still has these symptoms and he is speaking out for what he believes in nothing more.

I support the use of embryonic stem cells for use toward cures for people with ailments such as his 100%.

""Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, which is an early stage embryo - approximately 4 to 5 days old in humans - consisting of 50-150 cells.""

I do not see an issue with using cells that are 5 days old max and using them as research to save countless others possibly in the near future.

People really need to look at the information and not distort it with religious views. I understand that some believe that we are destroying souls and so forth at that stage but none of us know when something like that happens in us when we are born and in all honesty at that stage nothing is formed at all and its the BEGINNING blocks of life and not quite there yet.

Its a tough debate but its certainly one worth having. I hope it goes in the right direction and the fanatical portion of religions don't derail what could lead to amazing scientific achievements to come for all of human kind..."

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea would respond to a preemptive U.S. military attack with an ""annihilating strike and a nuclear war,"" the state-run media has said, heightening anti-U.S. rhetoric amid close scrutiny of its missile program...

More Likely they dont have the capabilities yet to really do that to a large extent but that leader is a crazy fuck and i would not be surprised if he goes out of his way to harm us. I hate to say it but it is looking more and more like we need to take out their missiles but it would mean bad things to come possibly in a big way. 

I mean they have a huge manpower of an Army and i shudder to think of the possibilities of that crazy nation. I dont think peace talks can work because how can you have peace talks and speak diplomatically with a crazy man? Seems pretty tough to me.

Too many crazy leaders out there. I hate governments.

Im sure its not helping me be less alarmed after watching old footage of testing nukes and effects in a lot of video as of late.

Sigh...

PS - On a side note launching off fireworks was kool and it made my 4th really fun but some other parts not so much. I wish some people were more appreciative and fucking respectful of others property. Im happy SOME people thanked me for the party over here..."

"event","Just got done watching The Matrix. Such a classic and one of my fav. It just reminds me i need to break out of my current mold and get my life in order and to take control of it and make a difference. I have been too lazy and not making any real use of my time, mind and body.

Im so frustrated with my world and this world in general. Things need to change and i need to help push that forward in my own life.

Its been a month now since i lost my job and my journey at Apple ended. But i need to snap out of it and realize its not the end of being productive and happy. I need a jumpstart myself in a big way.

On a side note... I need some damn illegal fireworks haha.  Yes i kno its probably not the best idea but man o man do i want to see and have my senses shaken not stirred with some good old fashion colorful explosions! Hehe

If someone knows where i can ""purchase"" some near me lemme kno! ha = P

Also so happy to be going to a freakin concert in less then a week now, next Sat.

WOOT 

NIN, Bauhaus & Peaches will take the stage ....

It shall be my 4th time seeing NIN in a year. So excited. And i have bitchin front and dead center seats too...

In Seats tho bla = ( I want to MOSH! Maybe ill have to start a seat Pit

"event","I really don't know what to do with myself. I have no job at the moment and can't find much to do other then my usual collecting of music and cataloging it. I want to make electronic music so badly but lack any talent to play piano or any teacher to learn to play and have no skills or experience with Logic and i want to get it but if i don't have any of those skills then why waste the money?

I am kinda afraid to here back from Apple as this possible job with them sounds more and more like sales heavy geared stuff and what i wanted away from after i started at Apple the first time. Sigh, i guess I'm only good enough for selling and nothing else. Makes me sad. Especially if i have to turn it down cause it either does not pay enough or is too crappy of a job. I really miss Apple tho and want back in but more and more it looks like this doorway in is not so wonderful as i had hoped.

Why can't i get my shit together better. ARgg. I hate being in the state i am in and this can't continue much longer..."

"event","Welp, as some of you may or may not know i no longer work at Apple. I worked in the Apple store in SF since it opened over 2 years then because of various issues i left (feel free to message me to ask me about the details). I am still heartbroken about it as it is my fav company and as most of you know im a huge Mac geek (Whatever! You know it gets all the ladies! Ha NOT) and i enjoyed what i did as a job immensely.

Welp i have been pretty bummed out lately and not really putting a huge effort into job searching and when i did i could not find much. I did get a strange call from a recruiter for Lockheed Martin at the Ames Nasa Research Center in Sunnyvale and she said they are looking for a Mac tech and i fit well with my experience. 

I talked to her a few times and sent my resume and did not hear much then a few days later (This Morning) She called at 9:30 (If you know me you kno how much i love (fuck no) mornings ) and asked if i could come in on very short notice at 1pm in San Bruno today.

I hesitated for a sec and thought how good it would feel to sleep in more and told her i would be there. I have never driven over the San Mateo bridge or in that area before so of course i got lost but thankfully did not make it that late. I chatted with her for a bit and she talked about my main interview that most likely would be the next day in the morning.

She told me i fit the job really well and wished me luck. Tomorrow at 9:30 Am i will be over in Sunnyvale all dressed snazzy (Thanks Josh!) hopefully and will give a sweet interview. 

The commute will be long just like before but this time i will make enough I'm hopin to move soon. I plan to move in the San Leandro area most likely and if someone wants to move out there and have me as a roomy hit me up! cause paying $1000/month will still suck still even with the money i may make.

Anyhow enough of the jibber jabber. Wish me LUCK everyone!

Later*"

"event","It is all over. I put in my resignation as of today at Apple. I have been working at the SF store since i helped open it 2   years ago. I did so in knowing that i was going to be fired tomorrow and i knew i had to do it. Before i left and after i erased some emails and wrote a quick note to my genii i just sat there and cried a bit. Even tho i had many issues there these people were partly my family and i was forced to leave it and them.

I went drinking after work with a few people from the store and it did make me feel better but after i left i felt very upset. I will miss that place more then anything i have in a long time. I hope it changes for the better for the people that continue to work their and hopefully the bullshit will end finally one day. I am off to listen to some music and mope and then pass out. Tomorrow i start a day without Apple and i don't know how to feel about that. We shall see..."

Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older
The unknown soldier
Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Unborn living, living, dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head
And it's all over
For the unknown soldier
It's all over
For the unknown soldier
Make a grave for the unknown soldier"

I'm happy that i passed my tests and all but other things are bothering me at the moment. Why is it that when you are nothing but nice to certain people that they do nothing but shit all over happy news of yours and other people's as well or positive things happen and nothing but negativity flys out of their mouth? I'm so fucking sick of people that go through life like that and cant just stop the bullshit and enjoy life for one second. A big FUCK YOU goes out to those people from me. Anyways lol.

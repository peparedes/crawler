"event","The concrete is abrupt tonight, sending sharp pain screaming up my legs to explode at the knee. The air is thick and muggy and disgusting odors hang heavily in it: the dead raccoon on the side of the road, cigarette smoke, truck exhaust. My right shoe wiggles loose sometime around mile three. That same crotchety street lamp blinks off a few steps before I pass under it. The moon is hiding behind wrinkled clouds. Headlights are startling and sting my eyes. The music is too loud, then too quiet, then too loud again. My left knee wobbles occasionally, but I just brace myself for a fall. I stamp the ground harder and quicken my pace, shoving the concrete back just as hard as it slams against me. I breathe deeper, inhaling <i>past</i> the odors. I dare my shoe to fall off; see if you can try to stop me. I run faster and more deliberately with every stride. I look above the headlights, ignoring their glare and I adjust my Rio as necessary with every new song. Tonight's run was in my face, and I stepped to the challenge, reaching my goal in record time.<br /><br />P.S. My petals slammed shut earlier and they're <i>not</i> interested in unfolding tonight. They're <i>not</i> interested in the half-ass moonlight peeking timidly from behind the clouds and they're <i>not</i> interested in the complicated, suffocating air."

"event","Back from the gentlest five-miler. The clouds dissipated after the rain leaving a sky of melting pastels behind, the slightly deflated moon hanging protectively over the dulled greens, browns and greys around me. The eager headlights twinkled, a pleasant change from their usual blinding and painful glare. The normally cold, solid, abrupt concrete beneath me seemed to give a little tonight, a soft landing with every step. Mere whispers of splint pain came and went just as quickly with no sign of the usual throbbing pain I have to talk myself through. The street light that quizically shuts off as I near it every other night remained on, it's cool white light hovering over me. No uncertainty, no frustration, no anger fueling my steps. As the lavender and periwinkle gradient became a muted cerulean, the sun went down in the distance leaving behind an apricot glow. The wind picked up and the air chilled as I rounded the last turn of my route, a quarter of a mile to go, I strode with more conviction - confident and able."

"event","As I rounded the curves of NM 502, the sun started behind a large bank of clouds and the Sangre de Cristos hung there against the horizon like a big, soft, purple blanket. I saw what I've seen in New Mexico all along - a kind of quiet comfort and safety. New Mexicans aren't the risky type, and the mountains hung there that afternoon like a great wall protecting all the little towns they surrounded, allowing life to continue routinely and systematically as it did with the rise and fall of the sun each day. For so long I thought this was the <i>wrong</i> way to live - safe, simple, risk-free. What I see now is that it's not the wrong way at all - it's actually very charming from the wide eyes of this girl. It isn't wrong, it just isn't right - for me.<br /><br />I didn't sleep much that night in Amarillo. Inside, a part of me was screaming to go back. Turn around and go back to him. But this move isn't about him - it never was. It is about me and making the best of my life, and I can't make the best - money, career growth, family - in New Mexico. Still, leaving him behind isn't easy.<br /><br />We continued on in the morning, tears falling from morning 'til afternoon and intermittently thereafter. Memphis was very quaint, and I enjoyed the drive from Arkansas into Tennessee. Thirteen hours on the road and we were just exhausted. We pulled in to Jackson and I was granted a reprieve from my sadness - Grey's Anatomy, Sonic, and cuddling with dogs. It came back in tidal waves alongside unremarkable but emotional text messages.<br /><br />I slept very hard and awoke sore and rigid this morning. I was physically. Emotionally. Mentally. Ehxausted. The day dragged on and on, shifting uncomfortably in my seat unable to find a seating position I (or my back) was happy with. Tennessee was a breathtakingly beautiful drive and then before I knew it we were in Asheville. I was in awe of the green trees and the delicate layers upon layers of mountains hiding behind a drape of thin mist. The air was clean and crisp. It wasn't even sixty degrees but I opened the windows and sunroof completely to take in the refreshing Blue Ridge air. It was truly beautiful and all I could think was that I wished he was there to see it with me, to be excited with me, to plan a life with me.<br /><br />I'm here now, safe and comforted by all those things that make coming home so nurturing: A parking space in the driveway, delicately scented bed linens, pizza, and the silent understanding of what my life is undergoing right now."

I realize that the reason I am so forgiving of the boys that I've been in relationships with is because I'm actually mad at myself for allowing things to be the way they were for so long. I won't lie, though. I have moments where I feel like a failure and I wonder if I'll ever meet someone who can handle dis girl. <br /><br />I started packing majorly.

"event","There's a scene in an episode of last season's Grey Anatomy in which Meredith is literally throwing herself at McDreamy. You can hear the desperation in her voice and see the pain in her eyes. ""Pick <i>me</i>. Love <i>me. </i>Choose <i>me</i>,"" she begs Dr. Shepherd to leave his cheating wife for her once and for all. <br /><br />When I first saw the episode, I empathized with Meredith, but I couldn't quite put my finger on the connection. I just knew that I knew how she felt, though I didn't know whom I felt that about. During a conversation with Mom earlier this week, she mentioned that she had seen a rerun episode of Grey's Anatomy and that this one scene totally reminded her of me. I knew instantly which one it was. <br /><br />My entire romantic history is summed up in those three short sentences. Pick <i>me</i>. Love <i>me.</i> Choose <i>me</i>. <br /><br />Keith was into drugs at the time. Loved his buddies. Loved his pot. Loved his gutter life. Said he loved me. Pick <i>me</i>, Keith. Love <i>me</i> enough to leave that life behind. Choose <i>me</i> over marijuana and LSD.<br /><br />Matt was into girls. In particular, he was into girls younger than himself and who specifically were not me. Said he loved me. Pick <i>me</i>, Matt. Love <i>me</i> enough to stop cheating on me. Choose <i>me</i> over all of your girls on the side.<br /><br />Travis was into himself. His very own feelings, thoughts, interests and choices. I know he thought he loved me. Pick <i>me</i>, Travis. Love <i>me </i>enough to step outside your comfort zone. Choose <i>me </i>over yourself once in awhile.<br /><br />No one. Not anyone. Has every said to me ""Pick <i>me</i>. Love <i>me</i>. Choose <i>me</i>."" No one has ever yearned for me in a way so passionate and desperate that they'd compromise their life for me and for my love. No one has ever put forth even a <i>tenth</i> of the initiative, love, patience, adoration or thoughtfulness that I pour forth from my aching, bruised heart each and every day.<br /><br />The only hug I got this week that I didn't have to seek out and force my way into the arms of the victim was from my boss when I told her that I was leaving. I do believe that one day someone <i>will</i> love me as much and as wildly and as freely as I him. And that belief ignites me."

Originally I had planned to find an affordable place to live close to work and save some cash for the next year, and then move back this time in 2007. The one option I had open closed and I just can't see busting my ass and handling the stress of finding a (very expensive) place to live in a town that I don't even want to live in. Things worked out perfectly, however, as I'm realizing every day.&nbsp; I just can't keep hovering over New Mexico like an aprehensive butterfly. I have roots, and I need to reconnect with them.

I haven't made it official at work yet, but almost everyone knows of my decision. I will be hugely sad to leave the great people I work for. I will not, however, miss the rude, irresponsible, and selfish ignorance that fuels some of my coworkers sometimes. I bust my ass and put my neck on the line, over and over and over, and it is never good enough. Thank goodness for the friends who tell me they appreciate me or pat me on the back when I go above and beyond. &lt;3

If you want a twin size mattress and boxspring, in EXCELLENT condition, an oak table with four chairs, or anything else I own, lemme know. I'm gonna pack the good and leave the rest.

"event","I always love my afternoon runs, no matter how much I dread them beforehand. Today's was just especially magical. As I descended into the canyon I immediately noticed the drastic erosion and reformation, the result of yesterday's torrential day-long downpours. It changed my route with every step, having to dodge a rock that didn't use to be there, or jump a muddy drainage tract that used to be full of soft sand. I encountered several folks, all smiling and all who actually responded to my usual ear-to-ear grin and out of breath ""hi."" I tragically ended the lives of at least three bugs, probably more, who currently reside in my stomach. It always feel like they're trying to fly back up and out, but I think that's more psychological than anything. Three miles through the canyon and I'm pooped, but it was great. Endorphins &gt; You. <br /><br />On the way to the canyon I passed the church and as I warm-up walked under the shade of the trees I caught a cool breeze carrying the scent of freshly cut grass on it. It was refreshing and made me smile. However, on the walk back from the canyon I passed the rows of Denver Steels and caught a muggy, hot scent of grass <em>being</em> cut muffled by the gasoline fumes the wind carried with it. Happiness really is in the details. It's those details that can bring back a memory or elicit a smile or bring about tears.<br /><br />And Whiskey Breanne Blazek chewed on my FIFTEEN dollar flip flops. I NEVER spend fifteen dollars on flip flops but she found the pair that I did and made them a scooby snack. She washed it down with just a few chunks of foam from the couch today. RAH."

"event","I just love my job. Love, love, love.&nbsp; Onie came in&nbsp; today, delivered to us by the animal shelter who picked her up after she ran away from home and got bonked in the head by a car. She had multiple gashes in her leg, and a broken sinus cavity resulting in something similar to a flail chest, but on the bridge of her nose instead of her ribs. She's this adorable, older black mutt with trusting eyes, furrowed brow, and worry wrinkle on her battered little forehead. She has an owner and thank goodness he is going to let us fix her tomorrow! <br /><br />I just ordered three books. I hope I like them! <u>The Secret Life of Bees</u> and <u>The Mermaid Chair</u> by Sue Monk Kidd recommended by B. While browsing for them I happened upon another book that I thought I might enjoy so I said what the heck and added it to my cart. <u>The Time Traveler's Wife</u> by Audrey Niffenegger. It should be good! I should also have them in time for vacation next weekend! Sweet!<br /><br />Talk about comfort food! I roasted a whole chicken tonight, using salt, pepper, and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray as coatings. YUM. Added corn, mashed potatoes, and gravy for a finger-lickin, down-home style dinner. You totally should have come over.<br /><br />It rained this afternoon, a lot. I went for a run in it, and it was so refreshing! It also really cooled this house off and I'm now enjoying a <em>lucious</em> cool breeze and an occasional flurry of goosebumps. <br /><br />Well, I have a date with some fat-free dirt in a cup and then a to-do list and a book in my bed. You're jealous, admit it."

Anyhoo, Whiskey's been a good/bad little pooch lately and Clayton has been showing signs of being a *gasp* almost-geriatric boy! He tuckers out on hot morning runs and coughs a lot after taking a big drink at the water bowl. I love that dog more than life itself. Let's clone him!

Writings that are so descriptive you can smell the grass and taste the sea water. Events described in such a way that I replace the characters with myself and get lost for hours.<br /><br />It's been <em>years and years</em> since I last got engrossed in a non-self-help book and I'm on a mission. <em>Years</em> since I would plop down on the loveseat in the quiet and fancy living room and read my newest R.L. Stine book from cover to cover before bed. It's time. Reading is just one more aspect of the nourishment and nurturance that I'm craving."

""Okay, okay. You guys can go."" <br /><br />I snapped them into their collars and tugged the GentleLeader over Whiskey's muzzle. I threw a long sleeve tee on over my workout clothes to avoid a sunburn and off we went. We walked happily the half mile to the far end of the canyon. As we made our way down the steep and rocky hill towards the bottom of the canyon, I released them from their leashes and they jogged ahead. <br /><br />I happily jogged, sweat <em>pouring</em>, listening to my dusty MP3 player, who doesn't see much use anymore since running shreds my knees every time. As we ran along the edge of a deep ravine I saw Clay perk up, like he does when he's about to take off after a rabbit or squirrel. I tugged my headphones off as I jogged to listen for him and as I turned to where he was directing his attention, two coyotes sat on a giant boulder not two feet away from me, staring at me at eye-level. Holy shit. I yelled for Clay and they took off, and of course, he took off after them. Thank GAUZE he had enough sense to leave them alone and come to my bellows. Surprisingly, Whiskey didn't budge. She planted herself in front of me and silently raised her hackles. She wuvs her momma. <br /><br />Anyhow, I'm really glad my dogs didn't become coyote play-toys, and I'm also really glad I didn't PEE MY FUCKING PANTS when a coyote was starin' at me! Chrissakes, y'all."

"event","What a disgusting night. I couldn't fall asleep, and continually woke up having bad thoughts or coughing and sneezing. I had two extremely detailed, graphic, and of course, bad dreams. B says I'm one of just a few people she knows that have detailed, sensical dreams and also remembers them. They left me waking up unrested and feeling victimized, wanting a hug. I hate that.

I *need* to go to dinner with Kelly tonight, but my bank account doesn't like me. It's not empty, but it's not as full as I like it. I think I need to splurge."

"event","because when she's crashed out sleeping on the floor next to me and I stare at her, her tail wags even though she doesn't wake up. I love, love, LOVE my dogs. 

So yeah, the NIN concert rocked me something fierce. I was singing along, screaming where appropriate, and following each song I loved with my trademark dog-whistle high-pitched squeal and clapping. Travis stood stoically behind me, holding me back from the crazy girl. Crazy girl waited the entire concert until Trent opened ""Hurt"" with a keyboard solo to start screaming at the top of her lungs ""FUCK YEAHHHHHHH"" every 3 minutes. Crazy girl was thisclose to getting my flip flop across her damn face. Some kid in the pit threw something on stage and Trent screamed ""Try it again, Motherfucker"" several times. They finished the show without and encore. Fuckin kid. I love how people at rock concerts are WAY more fun and interesting to watch and look at than the people that go to the country concerts I usually frequent. WAY more fun."

"event","I'm in Texas. College Station to be exact. And DL, I have NO idea what makes you love this town so much. Bleh! I scooped G up around 6:00 last night and after a bite to eat, we hit the road. At 9am we finally pulled into the hotel parking lot. Oh. Em. Gee. Talk about a long drive, and Greg did it all! Hold up, though, I accomplished something HUGE as well. I didn't sleep during the drive! Whoa!

Anyway, I'm here for the Texas A&M Veterinary Technician Conference going on tonight through Sunday, though we're leavin tomorrow after lecture gets done at 7. Yep, another 12 hours straight on home. I miss my poochies too much and hope they don't think I left them for good. I know that everyone at work is taking fantastic care of them. 

I have reached a comforting conclusion. No matter what happens between Trav and I, I am thankful for this entire ordeal. I feel again. For quite some time, I've felt numb to everything. I feel sad and pain and hope and happiness and ability now. Even if we never spoke again, I'd be alright, because finally I feel again, and as I told a friend the other day, ""sometimes feeling is good, even when it's bad."" I have taken steps to acknowledge the unadmirable way I've been living my life and am working on working out the bad and working in the good. Hooray!

As we drove through Waco this morning, I was in awe of the lush, dense green landscape. It made me really miss my Southern home and made me realize that New Mexico simply is NOT awe-inspiring to me and cannot be my forever-home. For now, I think it is a great place to work out the kinks in my life, though. Anyway, I was just grinning ear to ear at the sight of the wildflowers growing on the side of the road and the weepy, thick trees swaying in the wind. I am going to be okay, no matter what. I am on the right track, finally. For a moment, I even welcomed the sweet, cool humidity in the air that promptly found it's place upon my beaming cheeks and reminded me of summers in the South. That welcome has been warn out by the stinky, muggy air of College Station, but I am so looking forward to the return through Waco. Heh."

Still haven't gotten to the post-cry shivers yet. Will try to call therapist today to set up an appointment. Gauze I hope she's taking new patients - I'm a fun one."

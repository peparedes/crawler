"event","Tina said I should writing interesting posts.

So, I shot another model today.  Chermaine.  She's nice.  It was her first shoot, and she did well.  Hopefully the film shots I took of her, with my lights, will turn out.  That would be nice.

This is not interesting.

I need to work out 7 days a week, since I can because I have nothing much else to do since I'm not teaching now.

I passed the last CSET test...so now there is nothing holding me back from teaching next year.  Just need to double-check with the district about htat...and then, if things work out, then I'll teach.  IF they don't, then I wont teach, I'll just be a bum.

"event","Today was kinda boring.  i hung out with Ann in santa monica, but the places we went, were really boring, except for the resturarant. Wow! i ate wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to much bread. Actually, i just ate  WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY  to much!! lol... then i came home and went online and then, i just got bored so i went to like excerise. Now i am like obsessed with excerising, but i won't have an eating disorder. i am not gonna be one of those girls who just keep excerising and like over work themselves.  Right when i felt like way to tired and couldn't continue.. like i felt like if i did one more thing, i would die... i stopped. Most people, they just keep going. You know what i mean? i  just don't want to anyone to worry. i think Ann was worried, but come on. Just because i tired  to become anoxeric, doesn't mean i am going to do it.  i couldn't do it last time. whats the difference between this time and last time? I wanna lose weight the healthy way.. not the one that kills you. I know.. i know. Last time, i was stupid and not thinking clearly. Just wanted Andrew back, but i think i have realized that no matter what.. its just not gonna happen, even though i want it to so bad, you just don't always get what you want.

P.S. Jackies cat came home!!!!! yay!!! i am so happy for you Jackie!!!!!!!"

I have been looking around everywhere and i realized theres to many couples out there!!! i just feel lonely. i am sick of so many people saying i'm breautiful and hot..well if i am those things...then why don't i have anyone to love.

And i wanna say Happy bday to Natasha!!! one of the coolest friends i have!!! I love u Natasha!!!! anyways.. yesterday!!! omg!!!!!!!!! i was so happy!!!! like seriously!!! i wasn't emo.. i tried, but nothing could make me upset!!! i tried listening to emo music and i was just jumpin up and down.. i was syco!!! i even told Chris i wasnt emo and he was so happy!!!! i was so happy cuz Stefanie.. another awsome friend..was going to try to hook me up with someone , but it turns out he doesn't like me in that way, but its ok. Actually, when i found out i was ok..i am used to the rejection. i didn't let that get in my way of having a great day!!!! After school, Ann called Dean( guy stefanie was tryin to hook us up) and  Dean, Ann and i  went bowling!!!! i did really good.. got like 3 strikes and in the 2nd round ... i won!!!! but one thing bad happened last night. i was in the middle of bowling.. my dad calls my cell. i kinda missed it so then i called back and hes like all freaked out!!!!!! he read erins lj and the other night..erin and i were havin this convo..were i was talkin bout killing myself and erin was tryin not to make me and shit and at the end.. i said our slutness brings the boys to the bathroom. So my dad calls me.. freakin out and like doesnt believe a word i say!!! so that ruined my night and now hes like worried!! he was thinking bout gettin me a counsler, but i dont need one, plus i have erin. shes like my counsler!! so.. hes really freaked out!!! and today i had to say goodbye to my mom and grandma and the whole house. there leaving tomorrow at 8 am. and my mom even freaked out but she understands cuz she used to be like that when she was my age and my dad kept sayin it over and over again. hes like ur daughter is planning on killin herself!!!! i am not!! at least not right now!! in fact, i think i am over the emo thing.. i am not so sure, but my dad ruined everything. i was havin fun hangin out with Dean!!!!! and i was lookin hot.. i guess.. dont really know.but i might hang out with him monday or something..so its all good."

"event","my valentines day sucked!!!!!!! i got really sad and mad at Ann. she asked Chris to be her valentine. i mean.. its not a big deal, but to me kinda is. i am pissed at so many people who like him. i mean yea they can like him, but its like they would of never liked him if it wasn't for me. Ann didnt like him til she spent a day with him and Karen didn't  like him til my party. I kinda feel like everyone is taken him away from me.. like there is not a chance he would like me now. i used to think that, but now since everyone likes him.. its kinda like whats the point. im just not good enough or specail enough.  i think Becky is the only one who gets the fact that hes mine...but then again im not so sure if anyone gets it. they all spent a day with him and they like him!!!!!! and i remember Ann told me not to be friends with him in 7th and 8th grade cuz of all the fights and shit and now shes like all in love with him. Thats why at school if anyone noticed i looked upset..it was cuz of this whole thing!!!! so...yea...Happy Fucking Valentines day..the worst day ever and it should die!!!!! so...how was everyone elses day?!!! oh and Amit and Tom were the only ones who made me feel better..makin me laugh and shit.. i dont think they even knew wut was wrong, but still. i love you guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and you guys know that show hey arnold..well im helga cuz shes obessed with Arnold and its like me cuz im obessed with Chris. lol..well.. sorta. its like this whole thing Tom and Amit made up in photo. yea...so happy valentines day!!!!!!!

Dani and Emily did my makeup..they came over early like 3 something and you know whats werid.. my mom(not stepmom) but my mom knows Danis mom!!!! its cool, but its like strange at the same time.... i don't know how to like describe it. and then everyone started to show up right when they were doing my makeup and i was freakin out!!! screaming at like the top of my lungs. Then, we sang karoke and danced. So much fun!!! i really won't forget last night, even though i wish some things didn't happen, like everything was going good..at least i thought so. i go in my room..opened the door and i found Chris and Becky on my bed like hugging or something and i thought they were having sex. Right when the door opend, they like got off of eachother and chris fell to the floor. i just stood there and then i left and like told everyone they were having sex and then everyone was like why did u think that?!! they werent!!! well.. u know wut... i know they werent.. it just looked like it. i mean you walk into your room, seeing the guy you love with all your heart with your friend on your bed and the lights are like low...so excuse me for thinking that!!!! Becky talked to me later on and said she would of never have sex with Chris, especailly since hes mine, but still and later on, Ann, Becky, Stephanie M, Tom, Chris, Emily, Steven, Karen and I were outside and Chris and Tom went in the hot tub in there boxers and Emily went in with her clothes on. Tom and chris.....mmmmmm!!! i was like omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but then my grandma was being an ass and my parents were like pissed at me, but wutever. then they got out and we played truth or dare. it got really boring when Emily, Tom and stephanie left, but it was still fun!! Chris kissed me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *Sigh*!!!!!!!!!!! he kissed me like 5 times.. i think..but the 1st time was a dare, but pretty much after that he kissed me on the cheek!!!!! i tottaly regret kissing him on the lips. i just couldn't do it with everyone starin at me and i was laughing so i couldn't. I got dared to do it, but it was just hard. i wonder wut would of happened if i did kiss him on the lips.. i wonder if we would of been together or if things would be the same. i guess i will never know."

They aren't to thrilled. i got 3 d's and one A, b and C...very bad. I have no goal in life. i don't know what i want to be. i think its ok with me, i am like that girl who just waits til the very end to do something or wutever. what i really want to do is get out of ca!!! theres nothing here.. i wanna explore!!! I'm sick of CA..ITS LIKE FUCKED UP!!! now i don't know if there is a party. My dad thinks its stupid to have a party for me cuz of my grades, but IF THEY DON'T THROW ME ONE, I SWEAR I AM GOING TO LIKE LAS VEGAS OR SOMETHING ELSE!!!! SCREW THEM!!!! so if anyone is up to it..let me know. it would be our backup plan.

I don't want to stay here and end up all miss. drug addicate and like a rebel and shit. kinda think im heading that direction. i mean think about it... i used to be a good student.. never got D's...maybe on progess reports and only in one class.Now all of a sudden, i don't do homework, i don't give a shit bout my grades.. i think school is pointless and i wanna kill myself or kill someone else. the killing is just talk, but who knows what can happen, but i think you get what i mean. Sometimes at school, i have to fake all this laughing shit. i just think Hawaii would be better. i don't know... just seems the only thing to cure this depressing mood im always in. i could talk to someone bout it, but i just don't really think talking to someone can make it go away for good.  i might do kickboxing, which is good...get all the anger out, but i'm afraid i might have to much anger that i might kill someone, but it all depends if there is money and if i can find a class and my dad and stepmom are going to talk bout it. its more like if there is any money... might go to the bills and house and layla... i'm last on the list. yay!!!!!!! oh and my dad wants me to learn how to play a bass or instrument, but who knows if thats gonna happen."

I am happy for Ann if she likes him and they go out, but then its like i'm not. i don't know how to explain it. i could of told Ann last night when Chris wasn't there, but then i thought wutever...so i was depressed and i feel alseep at like 9 and then got woken up at 10 and went back to sleep. then, the whole day today, Ann kept saying call Chris so we can hang out so she called him and she finally reached him bout 7 and she called me saying hes busy tomorrow but next weekend there gonna do something and then ann invited me...which i think is sweet but i dont know cuz then i feel like im ruining everything. i don't know.. it just feels like that. And Ann if ur reading this, im srry if i made u like upset or something. go ahead and hang out with him and like him, its just me being jealous cuz you know me better then anyone else.You know how much i like Chris, but i got to face it, me and him = no together... just a friendship, which is better then nothing, but still and i think i like him more then Andrew.. im not so sure anymore. ahhhh!!!!!!!!! this fucking sucks!!!!!!! I miss Chris so much and i saw him yesterday!!!! i miss him hugging me.. i miss him making me laugh... i miss everything."

"event","i need someone to talk to. i need a shoulder to cry on.. i need a friend so bad. i can't talk to chris about this cuz its about him. we all know that i have liked him since 7th grade..right? well.. i thought i was over him, but today i have come to realize i am not and the thing is i like Andrew, but now i think i like chris alot more. so its all confusing!!!! and the thing is i have no chance with either of them!!!!! Chris doesn't like me..kinda found out on the phone today. Ann asked him if he had a gf  or bf and he said boyfriend? and then Ann was like cuz there is someone in the room(me) that likes u and i was freaking out and i forget wut he said, but he doesn't like me and what hurts the most is that everyday he says I love you!!!! and ugh!!! i cried!!! and now i might do it again. i feel so fucking stupid!!! how was i supposed to know he doesn't like me? you think i would get it through my head, but the way he acts and the things he says.. i donno.. just thought maybe he does, but i am wrong. Ann helped but when i came home, my parents knew something was wrong and finally i told them, but they just care about the finals and my grades. i can't focus right now. i tried studying, but my mind went off to chris. so many memories with him. i read the stuff he wrote in my yearbooks and i looked at his pics from 5th grade til 8th grade(yearbook pics) and i cried. i feel so lost and lonely and empty. i feel like dieing, but now that i think about it.. i can just imagine Chris face if he found out i was gone and its making me cry and when he went to hawaii and when he came back, he gave me a keychain and now i am treasuring it. he didn't have to buy me one.. i was joking bout him buying me something and he comes back with a keychain and then i thought for sure he liked me today!!! cuz i was talkin to amit and jessica and here comes Chris and like i was talkin bout how my bday is in 2 days!!!!! and then he said me and him have to do something together this weekend!!! just me and him.. i think. i donno.. just thought something...but  i am wrong. Now i wish i never said anything..that i like him and today i said i am pregeant with Chris baby even though i said i had sex with other guys, but its all  not true!!! i wish part of it was true..the part were chris and i have a baby, but more like i am chris baby!! like his girl!! u know wut i mean? i think!!!"

                      Now i wonder what the hell happened!!!!


UGH!!!!!!!!! I need to talk to Chris!!!!!  Everythings so confusing!!!!!! I am scared.. i can't call him.. i can't explain to him my feelings for him, even though i think i have stronger ones for Andrew. see now i am confused even more. ugh!!!!! i need someone to talk to right now!!! i can't get this out of my mind!!! its driving me crazy!!!!!!  i had a dream about Chris and Andrew. Thats like the 1st time i had a dream of them like in the same dream!!!!! and it wont leave me alone!!!!!!!! its all i think about. it was so fucking creepy, just the way everything happened. 
Dream......

It was a day before my bday, went to school and i looked really hot. i wasn't fat, but i wasn't skinny, i was perfect.  My hair was dyed, and i looked really hot. Chris sees me and he was shocked. he couldn't even talk to me...he was just all drooling kinda thing.. i cant describe it. Then, i was walking with everyone (Jackie, Amit, Ann, Becky, Steven S, Jessica, forget who else) and we pass Andrew.  It was pretty much the same thing chris did. I am talking to everyone. Chris comes up to me and gives me a present for my bday but he tells me not to open it til tomorrow and that read the card alone and he leaves. i was just like ok?!!! i had a confused look on my face. Then, 5 minutes later, its my bday!!!! Chris ignores me and i am just confused even more!!!!! Then, i am walking and Andrew comes up to me asking if we can talk and im just like sure and then he tells me he  likes me and i saw from the corner of my eye..chris walking with Drake And Chris is trying to talk to me and Andrew is tryin to talk to me and there both talkin at the same time and i hear from both of them that they like me alot!!!!!!! and then they get into a fight and i am just standing there so confused!!!! i walk away and read the note from Chris. it said something like he has always liked me..just afraid to ruin our friendship and that he wants to go out with me really bad! and then i woke up and faced it...its not gonna happen. 



Just someone get me out of this!!! just let me end my life now!!! i can't stand this anymore!!!!! maybe a good cry will help.
                                                                          3 days!!!!!!!"

"event","well... theres one thing to be happy about..my dad didnt find out i lied about the whole disneyland thing, which is good and i am going to Anns house tomorrow cuz now noone wants to go cuz there isnt a ride, but wutever..ill have fun shopping. to bad i didn't die..kinda wish i did. it's a long story and lets just say i feel like an idiot for even thinking i had a chance with him. Everyone says move on krystal..plenty of other fish in the sea..yea there is, but for some strange reason i can't let him go...i kinda want to, before i didn't but now its like wuts the point in loving someone so much when they don't even love you back. i am happy for him... really!!! but it just sucks alot seeing him and her and ugh!!!!!! All i can do is pretend to be happy and try to move on...focus really hard on that and school. That should be my new year resloution thing. lol....Chris is really helping me alot, even though he keeps saying hes sorry, hes helping. thanks chris for being there!!!!!! I love you and miss you!!!! oh yea..theres two things to be happy about...Chris is coming back tomorrow!!!!! yay!!!!!!!!! hopefully ill be ok...as long as i have friends who care and emo music and my awsome apple pie my mom made me which is calling my name right now...ill be ok...hopefully.


 p.s.Everyone comment..it would mean alot to me!!!!!!"

"event","i am really dead. tomorrow a bunch of people i know..well becky, sammi, sammis bf, Ann, and maybe more people are going to disneyland and Ann called me and asked if i could go. it tottaly slipped my mind, so i called my dad and asked if i could go and pretty much lied, but i can go. Now Ann doesn't know if she can go and i am screwed once again cuz i have no ride to get there unless i call Becky or Sammi and i don't know there number. i forgot to mention sammis boyfriend would be there and i think i wasnt sure if we were spendin the night there at the hotel...so i forgot to say that and i just said it was gonna be Sammi, Ann and Becky and I and maybe more people and said Sammis dad will be supervising or however u spell it, but sammis dad won't even be there. fuck!!!! wut am i gonna do when my dad finds out..if he ever finds out. it might be a big deal to you guys, but once i lie to my parents, espcaill about this, thats it..no more fun. i don't know what i was thinking or maybe i wasn't thinking and just hoping my dad wouldn't care and i could just have fun!!!!!!  well..if you don't hear from me or see me in about 3 weeks , it means i am dead. oh yea and remember how like staurday or sunday i was really happy and i think i told some of you and i think i wrote it in here and yea...well... i don't think its gonna happen unless i call him, but you all know me..its impossible and then again if i do even call him..it depends if hes busy or not which right now im starting to think he is..so there goes my hopes. wut else is new?!!!!!!

"event","Chris is in  Hawaii having the best time of his life. you think he would be back by now, but hes not. we had a very interesting short converstation online and hes having the best time ever. i should of gone with him, even if i couldn't, i should of just mailed myself there and stayed there forever. i was kinda hoping he was having an ok time, even though i am glad hes having fun, i just wish he was missing me as much as i am missing him.ugh!!! i really hate dreams!!!!  i should just never sleep or never think(not like i do, but i should just not do anything). all dreams do well for me is get my hopes up. i don't know why i try so hard cuz in the end, it just ends up  really bad. God!!! i am so pathetic!!!!! During the winter break, i have had about 7 day day dreams when chris misses me and he ends up liking me or Andrew ends up liking me.i am just a pathetic girl living in this fucked up life and everyone is enjoying it while i am sitting home  fucking thinking there is one guy out there that likes me. i don't even know why i bother with life!!!!!! i am so pathetic that i thought i saw Chris with JD, but it just turned out to be JD.
                 
                                                                       I am a pathetic girl in a Fucked up world!!!!

"event","my mom told me staurday night that she's thinking about moving to hawaii. i thought she was joking but now shes really thinking hard about it and i think she's going to. i am happy for her but then its like how can i be? Her reasons sound good. she said she useless if she stays here...she could end up in jail and i think that could happen..all the stuff she told me..its possible and its not good for me if shes in jail but its not good for me if she is a zillion miles away.  it really sucks cuz now who am i gonna talk to when im down. i could always complain to you guys and other friends but i feel bad when i do that. noone likes it when i complain and sometimes it makes things even worse.. i don't know why i do it. its easier to talk with my mom then my dad, stepmom, grandma and even layla( she doesnt even help..just makes things worse). my dad keeps asking me if im ok with this whole thing my mom wants to do and once again i lied and hes said i can always talk to him about anything..kinda hard since hes always working or sleeping or somethin else.  i don't know what it is but right now im just in that mood again. i was alright before. i was really happy , but i think its cuz something might happen this week that i really want to happen but who knows if its gonna happen and now i owe Ann so much!!! thank you so much Ann!!!!!!! hopefully you wont have to do anything for me now....lol.. i think i know why im in that mood,  its cuz Rick is home and i heard(from my dad) that Rick might be on a date tonight and i was shocked!!! i mean seriously!!! Rick on a date!!!! our  28 year old neighbor on a date and its not even me!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh well.....or maybe its cuz i miss you all and life sucks. plus its raining. i stared  out the window watching the rain fall and i was listening to my december and usually i don't cry but all of a sudden i broke into tears and now im online home alone...bored and upset and noone is on...just kill me now."

"event","i am really pissed off at my parents. Right when i need them to drive me somewhere, you know what, there not there!!! ugh! i cant wait til i have a car and i can go somewhere and be in my own little Krystal world!!!!! the world that everyone i know hates.. just cuz im always hyper and crazy and when i like a zillion guys and i only really really really care alot about maybe two guys out of those zillion. fuck you all who hate it!!!!!! i could of been at the mall right now with Chris!!! havin a blast and seeing if he does really like me, but no.. i cant get what i always want.  i thought this would be the perfect time to see if he actually likes me, but i always think wrong. never right..always wrong!!! i'm always wrong with something. His mom can't pick me up cuz she's a lazy bitch!!!!!!!! and he told me to run to the mall. Can you imagine me running?!!!! and a zillion people staring at me thinking wut the fuck!!!! i don't really wanna run to the mall... that would be  way to crazy. ugh!!! and you know wut.. he sounded so hot on the phone and like i started to laugh again (can't help it) and now im really thinkin he does like me, but  i know i am so fuckin wrong!!! it just seems obvious he does, but then again hes like that with every girl, but sometimes i just feel special.... i dont know why.. i just do. ugh!!! why is he so confusing like that?!!!!!!!! and  now im scared to death.. like hes going to hawaii for xmas. think about it ,he could either get a gf there or worse he could die going there or coming back on the plane!!! and i would never say goodbye. ugh!!!! i would cry for a zillion years. he's like the only guy who understands me and my pain and loves the way i act and loves the way i look. i don't really have to change, just one little thing to change and im perfect. He already thinks im hot and he just said change one little thing about me and ill be even hotter.   On the phone.. hes just sayin that i'm hot and im like no im not and hes just like yes you are and i said hes hot and he said he isnt and yea. Then hes like either we are both hot or we are both ugly and im just like we are both hot!!! and he was all happy about it. when i told him i couldnt go to the mall.. he sounded kinda upset about it, or maybe it was my phone, but ill see him tomorrow and everything will be good.  woo! can't wait til tomorrow... i have a final in math and a spanish test.. at least i will see chris!! and then stauday my cousins are coming..yay!!! not!! so i hope everyone has a great winter break and i will miss you all!!!"

"event","i am so fuckin confused!!!!!!!!!! Chris really confused me. noone has any clue how confused i am. In spanish, i was like talkin to him and his friends and he's like i really gotta tell you somethin krystal and i'm like tell me!!! and he's just like i can't cuz your gonna hate me after words and i'm just like no i wont and this went on for like 3 minutes. He told me to like go kinda far cuz he has to talk to some of his friends about what he wants to tell me and im just like ok?...and so i left and came back and he got kinda pissed and im just like tell me!!!! and some guy i dont know was like hes tallkin about how much he loves you and im just like he doesnt and i was like thinkin about it if he really does, but i don't know. Chris told me to come back and i'm just like tell me..and he's like ok... he trys to but he cant.. so he writes it down. hes taken forever and i'm just like omg!!! and so then i go back to my seat he throws the note to me.. Andrew berman and his friend grabb the note and read it..chris runs and grabs it and throws it to me. i kinda read it, but couldnt really cuz it was ripped. i told him and he wrote me another one and gave it to me. its just saying how pretty, cool, funny, etc i am. and he loves me as a friend. Then he said if i change one little thing about me... i would be sexier then i am now. i'm just stitting there reading it and i'm just like omg!!! does he like me or does he not?!!! you know i can't read his mind...and i have known him since 7th grade and he doesnt like me but then i was just like maybe he is starting to..but wutever. Then, like before the bell rang, he comes up to me and says i am so srry and im just like its ok.. i get it alot and he said he was gonna cry and im just chris..its fine. im not mad at you. We hug and then hes just like i love you!!! and im like i love you too. kinda forget if he said after that as a friend or not but wutever. All of a sudden he talks about how pretty i am. He's like i love your eyes and your simile. I'm just like i hate everything about me. He like i love your eyes, and like he talked about them and yea. Now, im really confused!!!!! He's usually never like that. i mean yea he says i love you to every girl and gives them hugs and yea....but just wut he said!!!!!! but also in the letter, he said he wants to help me become even sexier so then i was  like hes himself but hes not. you know?!!!! But now i wonder if he like pissed off at me cuz i told emily and Dani how chris wants to help and yea...well...they got pissed off and wrote a letter to him pretty much telling him to stay out of what there doing and yea..and i wrote to chris sayin to ignore there letter and that if he wants to help.. he can.  but i dont know if he read theres and mine and wuts going to happen!!!! i have no fucking clue wut to do!!! and like Guys are so hard to read. you can never tell if they like you or not., but for me its usually they don't, but maybe there are guys out there that like me..there just not tellin me and maybe they found something special about me.wish i knew."

LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: um 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: cuz u didnt care
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: all of a sudden heather was ur new fucking best freind and u forgot about me
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: nice. 
lust xandx liars: i did too care. you were mad at me so of course im not gunna IM you. i didnt wanna be told off so why would i IM someone who is mad at me? and heather and me became friends because wehad hung out the one day and had fun. and i invited you to come. 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: ya but see after that 1 invitation u sorta forgot to call me back first of all, then u just forgot to tlk 2 me. @ all. 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: but thats okay u have heather and heather has u 
lust xandx liars: the second time was a random 9:30pm thing. what did u want me to do call you and say 'im going to heathers this second wanna go?"". i always forget to call peopel thats when they call me. i remember i called you and you let me go cause nate was over
lust xandx liars: and then liek the rest of the times we hung out was after u were mad at us so we werent gunna call u when u were mad at us
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: no u dont ghet it. 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: im tlking about the times wen u would call me liek 356892356 times a day 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: then before i got mad @ u guys u just stopped. 
lust xandx liars: you stopped calling me too so i wasnt going to be a pain in the ass for you if you didnt want me to call that oftne
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: ya w/e
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: i would call u 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: and u would be like ""ill call u back later""and u never did
lust xandx liars: it slipped my mind. do you want to kill me cause i have a bad memory? you called me less too so i am not the only bad person. i forgot to call u back and when u called less and less i figured you got busy with nate and had other things to do but i didnt fret. i only talk to heather like once a day. so it isnt like we talk 93478378437 times a day
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: oo okay 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: well thats a hell of a lot more than u tlk 2 me
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: but w/e u seem to have a jolly time with that 
lust xandx liars: YOU WERE MAD AT ME SO I DID NOT CALL ME
lust xandx liars: YOU*
lust xandx liars: give me one reason i would call you if you were mad at me?
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: idk

LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: but u didnt care
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: but w/e
lust xandx liars: i wasnt gunna stop being friends with heather so i didnt see how we would see eye to eye and get over this?
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: exactly!
lust xandx liars: ....?
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: u wwere willing 2 give up our friendship but not heathers
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: ust xandx liars: i wasnt gunna stop being friends with heather
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: but u were fine wen u and me stopped being friends
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: thast nice
lust xandx liars: because i didnt give up our friendship. you did when u were mad at me. heather gave me no reason to stop being her friend. because i see her like once every 2 months. i talk to her once a day? theres no reason to stop being her friend or stop talking to her or be mad. she didnt care if i forgot to call her back. you got mad that i talked to her once a day and saw her like 3 times. i didnt see the big deal. i still talked to you until you got mmad at us'
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: wow 
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: ur retarted
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: u dont get it
lust xandx liars: then explain it to me so i can get your concept

LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: i didnt get mad that u didnt call me back
lust xandx liars: u sorta forgot to call me back first of all, then u just forgot to tlk 2 me
LiLhOcKeYhOnEy5: i got mad cuz i was friends with u and heather before u guys even met each other then u guys always got together qnd left me out
lust xandx liars: we became close. you should have kept reminding us that u felt left out instead of ONE time when u flip. you should have asked one of us to hang or ask both of us. you neevr asked us anywhere

<font face=""Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"" style='color:black; font-size: 10pt;'>
If you can't access the site, you have a minor freak out - and a major case of hitting reload.

You found yourself composing journal entries during dates, movies, even sex!

When you're out, you suddenly think of a witty reply to a comment somebody made to you... several days ago.
  
You actually call it LJ and not Livejournal. Check.

You've downloaded some sort of LJ program which has only the purpose of making entries easier to write without going on the site manually.

You consider it a great offense if someone deletes you off their friend's list. 

The first thing you do every day when you go online is check your friends journals - even before checking your email.

You actually paid money for a few extra pictures with a full account when you could actually just alternate pics when you want to for your screen icons.

When your friends ask what's new, you get mad at them because you already wrote it in your LJ and they didn't check it yet.

You have put more time into LJ than all your assignments for the semester.

You have more friends on LJ than in real life.

You've met at laest 50% of your LJ friends. 

You can't seem to call your friends by their real names - only LJ names will do.

You've fallen in love with someone you met on LJ.

You have posted about a party or get together on your LJ... and random strangers showed up.

You are guilty of traveling more than an hour to meet someone with LiveJournal. (Extra points for traveling five hours or more)

You've written a protected entry about one of your LiveJournal friends. (Extra points if they eventually found out about it)

You have written posts to notify people you're going to sleep.

You talk about your LJ friends to your real life friends all the time... like they're a part of your group.

You've created a LJ community, and people actually post in it.

You've been recognized in real live by a fellow LJ'er.

You have friended someone because of their LiveJournal icon.

You have ""pity friends"" on your list, who you would defriend if you could.

You've pimped one of your friends on journal, trying to get people to friend him / her.

Instead of doing research, you post difficult questions on your LiveJournal.

Your pets all have their own LiveJournals.

You know, right now, how many people have friended you (without peeking).

You've stopped being friends with someone in real life because of something they've said on LJ.

You're guilty of posting sexy or nude pictures to get more people to friend you.

You have consoled yourself after a horrible day thinking ""At least this will make a great LJ post""

You're jealous of people who have more friends and / or comments than you.

You have written a really great, solid post - only to be disappointed by the lack of good comments.

You're guilty of commenting excessively to get more traffic to your journal.

You've deleted a post a few minutes (or hours) after you've written it, because it seemed lame in retro spect.

You give shout outs to all your LJ friends on their birthdays.

You have an additional, secret journal that hardly anyone knows about.

You've broken up with someone - or ended a friendship - soley via LiveJournal.

You have gotten mean anonymous comments (bonus points for figuring out who it was via their IP)

You've been reported (or reported someone) to LJ Abuse.

You've been featured on LJ Drama.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends who are LJ addicts.</font></td></tr></table>

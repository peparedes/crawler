They were an icy blue, and I kept looking at them because I noticed that it looked like he had black eyeliner on and that's why his eyes were so noticible.  I laughed at the thought and then brushed it off.  OMG!  Today at work I'm talking to my other manager and I found out that he is a drag queen!!  He has shows, and models.  I couldn't do anything but laugh.  I cannot imagine him like a women.  I knew it was makeup.  I knew it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bruce was really upset at the end of the night because he said that he wanted me to have the best time ever and he feels the night wasn't good enough.  I tried to tell him that even though after ring dance we just rode around in his car I had a great time because I was with him.  Of course I wimped out.  Is this love that I feel for him.  I get so excited and happy when I am around him that I am speechless.  I am never speechless!!!  I wish I could just tell him how I feel.  That everytime I hear the phone ring I wish it was him.  Everytime he calls I would rather listen then talk because his voice comforts me.  I really think that I love him.  Whenever other guys try to talk to me I back off because I can't see myself being with someone else.  He was really sad after ring dance.  I thought I saw tears in his eyes.  I should make the first move.  The next time I see him which is soon I am going to tell him everything."

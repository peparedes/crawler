"event","Lately my aunt has been showing my apartment on the weekends trying to rent it out (which she did) and when I come home all my shit is moved around.  Fine, at least she tells me she's coming.  But I just went home on my lunch break and my bath mat is moved in the living room, my cleaning products from under my sink are scattered all over outside my bathroom, and my chair is moved in my bedroom.  No one told me anyone was going to be there today.  They are totally taking advantage of me just because I am family.   Any other tenant would be pissed I'm sure.  Anyways, I've only got 4 more working days in Kohler!  Woohoo!  I don't know what to do about Eric, he's getting kind of clingy.  I barely know him and he's called me a few times this week.  I told him we'd hang out tonight but I'm thinking of calling Ross instead."

"event","So I came home this morning from Luke's house around 7 this morning.  I didn't tell my parents I was staying the night 'cause I ususally don't tell them.  And they asked me where I was so I told them I spent the night at Lukes (which I didn't think was a problem because my mom knows that I'm not the attracted to Luke in any way, and he's just a good friend.)

But then my dad gets all pissy and is like, ""if you ever want to be in a serious relationship with a guy you better knock this off.  Guys are gonna think you're a whore, and I know, 'cause I'm a guy!""  

He said that to me!  And first of all, if you know me at all, you know I'm not a whore.  And second... all of my friends know Luke, and they know I'm not into guys like him.  Third, it is totally common for people to crash at their friends houses after drinking.  Who gives a shit?  They're lucky I don't lie about this kind of stuff to them!  I thought it was good to be honest with them, but fuck that.  I'm going back to lieing to them.

I want to have a party at my apartment already.  This blows"

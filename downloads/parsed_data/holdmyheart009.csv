"event","Don't you just wish sometimes that we could all go back to when we were 5. When everyone you saw was your best friend. When skinned knees were easier to fix than broken hearts. Where there was no such thing as drama and the biggest fight you had with your best friend was who got the pink crayon first?? House was the greatest game in the world and you had to fight over who would get to be your husband. Life was so simple. Tag was the greatest. Boys all had cooties. Ew. You kissed her for a penny?! That's alot of money 1 dollar is. mhmm. I was rich when I had a dollar. Cannnndddyyyy mmmmmm. 5 dollars every friday. That was my allowance. I would always spend it on beanie babies. Any one that was cute. Yep. My blankie went with me everywhere. Stupid braces. Stupid teeth.

Don't get me wrong I love being 17, but it's harder than being 5. 

I'm madly in love. Never felt this way before. But it's so hard when NO ONE in their right mind believes that we'll make it through. It's gonna end horribe. Her heart is gonna get broken. Okay if it's gonna get broken so be it. That's life. I've never felt so strongly about anyone in my whole entire life. I would take a bullet for that boy. [[Obviously since he likes to shoot me and stick me soo freaking much!]] The only real friends I have is his best friend and a couple other people. Yay for best friends. I hate being talked about. Hate Hate Hate. Drama. stupid stupid. I want to be able to play Barbie's again and not get made fun of becuz I'm not growning up. So what. I just want to be able to wake up one morning and realize that my life is better than it should be. Maybe in 5 years...

I'd really like to see you there.
I can't pretend like i don't care.
because I really do yeah.
please just kill the drama.
go to sleep, we'll talk tomorrow.
dream about me (about me), and don't worry
we'll be fine (be fine).

can you hear me?
can you see me?
what I don't know can not hurt me.

I'm turning around.

I just really do want everything to work out
like the motion picture endings.

"event","I'm so done with people. so done. LISTEN UP. OUR RELATIONSHIP IS NOT WITH YOU GUYS IT'S BETWEEN US. stop acting like you know EVERY little thing. You don't. You may think you do, but you're so wrong. GET OVER YOURSELVES. grow up, fast. Before reality comes and slaps you in the face....and if that doesn't happen any time soon....I WILL. 

All our secrets they are tailored trouble
Draped loose now around your hips
Your spotless instincts are valid
We coexist
Got 26 days to work with (got 26 days)
We got 26 days to work with (it moves, it moves, it moves)
We'll see what all gets done

I'm an addict for dramatics
I confuse the two for love
""You can't tell me that you don't beg...""

Liar (liar)
If we're keeping score
We're all choir boys at best

Then back on that island
That you swear by
Still barely can't afford
It's still a question of
How long will this hold?
Is it any different now that we are
Don't you go there not here, not now

Not here, not now

Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke 
Fast lives are stuck in the undertoe 
But you know the places I wanna go 

'Cause oh oh oh, 
I've got a sickness 
You've got the cure 
You've got the spunk I've been lookin' for 
And I've got a plan we walk out the door 

No you wanna just let go, 
It's time to roll down the windows 
Sing it oh oh oh 
Yeah all we need 
So here we go 

Turn it up 
It's five minutes to midnight 
You're coming home with me tonight 
I can't get enough, shakin' me up 
Turn it up 
Alright 
At five minutes to midnight 
You see our name in city lights 
We'll make the clock stop 
Make your heart drop 
And come alive 

We could pack up 
And leave all our things behind 
No fact, or fiction, or storyline 
'Cause I need you more than just for tonight 

You're oh oh all I care 
I can't stop my breathing 
I'm weak and you were my medicine 
I won't stop till I am under your skin 

No you wanna just let go, 
It's time to roll down the windows 
Sing it oh oh oh 
Yeah all we need 
So here we go 

Turn it up 
It's five minutes to midnight 
You're coming home with me tonight 
I can't get enough, shakin' me up 
Turn it up 
Alright 
At five minutes to midnight 
You see our name in city lights 
We'll make the clock stop 
Make your heart drop 
And come alive 

And when the clock strikes twelve 
Will you find another party 
Go and kiss and tell 
'Cause you know I never will 
I think we should strike a match 
We'll hold it to the wind to 
See how long it lasts 
We can make the time stand still 

Turn it up 
It's five minutes to midnight 
You're coming home with me tonight 
I can't get enough, shakin' me up 
Turn it up 
Alright 
At five minutes to midnight 
You see our name in city lights 
We'll make the clock stop 
Make your heart drop

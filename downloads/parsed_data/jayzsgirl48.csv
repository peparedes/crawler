"event","Well.... once again.. I'm not really sure what to say. I know I forgot to write yesterday.. but not much happened. I went for a walk with Janell. We went to see our friend Paris's little baby. *She's so cute* .. and then I went home because I didnt feel good. And today.... well, I woke up at 2pm.. and I still didnt feel good, but I went over to my friend Jills apartment for a lil bit to hang out... and now.. here I am.. once again... at home.. and not feeling good."

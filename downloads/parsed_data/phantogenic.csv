"event","My friend recently asked me to send her photos of myself and things around me. Certain photos intrigued her in a way I wasn't expecting as I have grown close and very fond of this person.
She fully rocks my world.
She lives 11 thousand miles from me but she rocks my world.
I have an incredibly busy job and I enjoy knowing that when I get home she's usually there to talk to and it makes my day worthwile.
I want to marry her. But I don't think she likes me the same way.


Don't really know what else to write at the moment. Just felt like adding something new."

"event","I would like to say that I am incredibly impressed with anyone who folds or packs things for a living.

I have quite a nice and expensive car, and as a result endeavour to take the best care of it. I bought a car cover the other day and decided to try it out as I'm doing a bit of engine work for a mate and as a result my garage is unusable. 

I'll be fucked if I can get it back into its bag.

The same goes for sleeping bags and poncho's that fold up into the hood for easy storage.

Anyone who can effectively; (tidly too) roll a sleeping bag and easily put it back into its bag can get a standing ovation from me.

I watched Dawn of the Dead on dvd today. Can't say it was scary or anything, but I've never had nightmares or been scared by a book or a movie.

Except for one occasion... I was 9 i think? I remember taping this tv programme and it was supposed to be adults only because it was apparently scary... it wasn't, apart for one section where this guy starts chasing another guy through an alleyway and he loses him, and of course the suspense music starts while the guys slowly looks for him... then WHAM! this hobo jumps out of a dumpster and scared the shit outta me. My milo went everywhere... my ass totally lost contact with the couch. I remember absolutely pissing myself laughing for about an hour afterwards.

Will definately be interested in watching Shaun of the Dead however...


On a side note - my heart goes out to those affected in the disgusting tidal movements around Asia."

"event","I spoke to a friend the other day and she told me that I need to concentrate more on myself and to stop worrying about what the rest of the world thinks about me and the people I associate with.

I told her to fuck off.


I got drunk the other day and this guy was in a bar and he grabbed a girl standing near us, she screamed an awesome flow of english language but he persisted. 

We decided to get involved.

He turned and told me that I was a quote ""punk ass skinny white boy who should go home to his momma"".

I told him he had far too many teeth for a smart cunt.

By this time the bouncer had arrived and told us to get the hell out.
We left and unfortunately didnt see him later that night.

I don't like to drink. It gets me into trouble. Along with my sarcasm and ever running mouth.
I used to drink a lot. I used to smoke tobacco a lot as well. 
Kel you'll be proud to know I stopped smoking for my new years resolution. Again.
I'm sorry for the hurt I cause people. I'm sorry for being such a fuck up."

"event","A dear friend suggested that I write more often in my LJ, as when I do, they seem to be relatively interesting.

As I cannot think of exactly what to write, it was put forward that I create a list of what I want right now but don't have.

1. A plane ticket to South Carolina.
2. New clothes. Not socks however... more underwear.
3. To get rid of this friggin ass of a cold that I have right now.
4. To have more time to myself.
5. To not have friends who like to molest people mentally.
6. To sleep soundly at night, and not arrive home every night to an empty house.
7. I also want my 1500 cds back. To the lowlife scumbag maggot who who broke in and robbed me... I don't have to sleep. I will find you, even though I know the cd's would have been sold by now.
8. I should probably put peace here, but in actual fact I don't want peace. I want total anarchy. I want uncontrolled wild nights and lots of crazy friends who race around in cars and annoy the neighbours. I want to be a teenager again. 
9. I don't want to be afraid of losing anyone, anymore. Ever.
10. I want a new bike. All boys want a new bike.
11. I'm tired. I honestly can't be fucked writing anymore."

"event","Well. Aren't friends of the family lovely.
Was supposed to enjoy a meal tonight with Brad's folks and his girlfriend.
Due to unforseen circumstances I was politely told that there would be no dinner as the family were too upset to have me as a guest.
Holly is Brad's now single girlfriend.
I will be modest and say that English is my forte. I have exceptional spelling and grammatical skills however, I am lost for words to describe just how much I hate, no LOATHE Holly.
Apparently she has managed to convice the Johnson family that I am not a nice person and that I shouldn't be allowed to partake in the funeral of someone I've known for the last 11 years.
I will hunt her down. I will endeavour to make sure I hurt everyone she knows and loves leaving her completely and utterly alone.

Know this bitch. I Know Where You Live."

"event","I don't remember much after that, I do, but I think my mind tries to prevent me from remembering which sometimes I wonder if it's a good thing or not.

My life went on as it does, until I woke from a dream a year ago, of my uncle John in Spain telling me to never be afraid.
My auntie, John's husband rung the next day and told me he had been shot in a home invasion. I had been part of his Will, but about a month later I'd found out that the large fortune he'd had had mysteriously disappeared.

To top it all off, my sister went missing last year and left me utterly drained. She's still missing presumed dead.
I have a guardian angel. I'm sure of it. I'm sure she works for someone other than God. Cos whoever is running the show up there sure as hell doesn't like me.
Through it all I've never cried. I've never been angry, I guess its all predestination.
I'm not religious. I undertook Roman and Greek history in my final two years at High School. I'm more inclined to believe in mulitple Gods rather than just one. Like Janus, who sits beside the door and makes sure evil spirits don't enter your home. The english word Janitor arises from it. Or maybe like Hades, the Greek God of the underworld. And Mars the Roman/Greek? God of war.
Either way im shattered.
I'm talking to my second best friend at the moment. She got me into writing my thoughts down in here. She's a beautiful, independant young lady who will go far in life if she stops fucking around and starts concentrating. You're so beautiful, you're so clever, talented and adorable. I know that other people will read this thats why I put it on here. Love is such a strong word, and I could never put anyone through something like that. But I do love you. You've been a great person to know. You will always be a great person.. And no this isnt a suicide note or anything, I'm just merely ranting now. 
People think my life is a tragic sob story for those who know it, and well you're wrong. It's made me who I am today. A sick, twisted but well hung individual. (slightly to the left ;) ) 
In spite of it all, I will go on. I will outlive a lot of people, but I know there are so many others who are worse off than me. But it will never make me want to truly contribute to the hungry and the needy.
I will remain a selfish prat. However, one day things might change.
Fuck knows when, cos I sure don't.
That's enough for now.
Maybe I'll write in here again... maybe I won't... but you know most of my 22 years on the planet now... and yet most of you who read this will never know me, nor even care."

"event","After a 27 hour labour a fat, strangely clean baby was born on the 29 April 1982.
The nurse took me in her arms, almost got to the scales to weigh me, but didn't quite make it, as my first response to being born was to shit on the first human to touch me.

I become the fourth in the family, with my sister; Susannh (susan) born four years later, two older brothers, Richard and Andrew, and an older sister; Michelle made up my family.

On the 16th of September 1985 my Grandfather died, and we went to his funeral. On the 17 we left Madrid and travelled home to Pamplona. At 5.15pm a truck driver crossed the median strip and hit a Ford travelling in the opposite direction crushing the two front seat occupants into a 12cm space. The third occupant a 3 year old boy had folded up in the back seat, and survived with a scratch on his chin. I don't remember any part of the crash bar the screams of my parents following in the car behind.

Life went on and later my sister was born, she had been somewhat disliked by someone upstairs and had been given cerebral palsey at birth. Its a brain defect, she could talk but not walk, was so pretty but hated because she was different.

June 6 1993 I will forever remember as d-day, not because of Gallipoli but because my sister now seven had called me into her room, I thought nothing of it and being stupid we started playfighting. Half way through she stopped and hugged me and said I love you. Tell mum and dad I'll see them soon. 

I'll end now. I need a cigarette.
I'll come back soon and finish it off Brad."

"event","My best friend died today, I'm utterly hopelessly destroyed.

Two days ago, Bradley Johnson contracted meningitis as a result of sharing his girlfriend's coffee.
She's a carrier of the virus, but doesn't actually have it.
What has confused the doctors is that they have been together for three years, have obviously kissed and slept with each other - why would he contract it now?? Two days, he felt sick, had a rash, went to the doctor, was rushed to hospital, slipped into a coma within hours and then lost his fight with God.

I told him a while back about this site and he said it would be a wise thing to add my somewhat small yet incredibly large autobiography in here... so in memorium I'll attempt to tell what only a select few know."

If I could be her lover, For ever and a day,
And she my faithful sweetheart, 
Until her hair turns grey,
We would be so happy, When either's lips were numb,
They would not smile in heaven,
Til the other's kiss had come."

"event","My apologies if I turn out to be a crap speller, or just plain bad at grammar. This is a new thing for me so really making a go of it is not something too high on my list.
Spent the day at work today, customers are dying off as the company I work for Auto Truck Centre has been sold by the owner, and as a result is closing down, and being taken over by a Construction and Truck company called Titan Plant Services... They import all the Volvo trucks and diggers and other happy horseshit into New Zealand.
They decided not to hire me as they want to run a skeleton crew - having the bare minimum of staff to run the show, its their own undoing as rotorua is a huge forestry area, and they're gonna need all the staff they can get.

Havent been home for very long, managed to sit down and watch The Simpsons, 7pm, 7 days a week, kinda disappointed in TVNZ, the feel that repeating the real original shows is a good thing - as a result its reduced the viewers nationwide, but I'm sure its a conspiracy. - Hell everything these days is a conspiracy.

Well that should do it for the first go - it should give you an idea on what to expect in the future from me, a bunch of whining text.

Night."

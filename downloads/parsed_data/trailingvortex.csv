However, he agreed that my jerky tasted better, so we used that to make a sea around it. So that people could taste the meat without destroying the work of art.

But our combined effort was beaten by a pie. :(

In other news, it's the time of year again: the ants are anting. Big fat queens (some of them having already rubbed their wings off against a handy surface) with that slightly dishevelled and satisfied just-been-fucked look crawling all over the place looking for a home. Picked up a few off the pavement and helped them into some bushes, but can't help them all. I like seeing ants in their natural state.

"event","So, yesterday Germany rather sound paddled england 4 - 1 in the World Cup. Not too surprising, I suppose.

I spent the afternoon on the bus from London, so I asked one of the conductors how the game had gone when I got off. When I heard the news, I was fighting to suppress a grin all the way home. Some woman in England colours mistook my strangled rictus for a bitter grimace, and confided to me how sad it was and that she was proud of them that they had gotten that far. I faked sympathy and solidarity quite well, I think, mainly out of fear of being publicly strangled to death by a stranger with an England scarf.

Do you want to know WHY I was happy? I don't particularly care whether Germany win or lose anything, but I do know that the English are the worst winners in the world - nothing sportsmanlike or gentlemanly about the way they comport themselves in case of victory. If England had beaten Germany in a World Cup match, I would have never heard an end to the gloating. They still sing and dance about a World cup QUALIFIER match they won against Germany 10 years ago. They still sing about their sole World Cup Victory in 1966. If I were them, I wouldn't even mention it out of embarrassment that it last happened 44 bloody years ago. Don't they realise how pathetic it looks from the outside?

And England fans have songs centred around their old 'nemesis', Germany, such as ""Two World Wars and One World Cup"" and ""Ten Bombers"". Germany fans do not have such songs for England. Because they don't care about England.
There is no dignity in a one-sided rivalry.

All things being equal, I wouldn't mind England doing well. It would be nice if everyone got their fair share of victories. And whoever wins, the world will not be a worse or better place. It's just a game. But the English are such awful winners that I much prefer their little souls crushed into a more civilised shape."

"event","Ha! Made you think that the government agents had come and taken me away! But they did not! 

Anyway, is it not odd what things strike you most remarkably about a person?

Take my housemate/landlord Neil. He is terrified of spiders. Utterly horrified and petrified. And he doesn't much like animals either (pretty much disqualifying him from being English :P). But he never kills spiders, nor does he ask me to kill them for him. He always goes out of his way to trap them and throws them out into the garden, rather than stomping on them or even flushing them down the loo.

Just the other day I heard a scream, and I ran down the stairs to find him standing over a mug covering something. I slipped a card under it and picked it up to find the biggest spider I have EVER seen in this country; not just in terms of legspan, but in sheer solid weight. It was huge and shiny and strong, and had enormous fangs that were clearly visible. Even I, who love the things, was a little cowed. He asked me to please take it outside. 

This I actually find deeply admirable. It is telling that even raw terror and duress will not submerge his moral sentiments towards the object of his antipathy. When the zombie apocalypse comes, I shall be glad to have such a chap on my side.

What I find less admirable is that he refused to let me keep it as a pet. I would have fed it so well so it would never have been tempted to eat him! Doesn't he see that? :P"

"event","There has been much excitement in the last week or so about some high-up in dear old Mother Church claiming that gays had a tendency towards paedophilia (not to be confused with haemophilia, which incidentally does not mean being aroused by the sight of blood, or Philadelphia, whose founding ethos did not centre on brothers touching each other inappropriately) and everything I have read has centred on how angry people are and how offended and how outraged and other such emotive nonsense. I haven't read any actual critical analysis of the hypothesis the dear bishop put forward. So I've throught about it for a while, and here's my own hypothesis.

Gay men are attracted primarily (though varyingly) to masculine features - this is what, by definition, makes them gay. This is a tremendously obvious and qausi-tautological statement. I feel almost stupid writing it down. Masculine features are size, height, heavy bone structure, muscles, deep voices, et.c. These are all tremendously opposite to typically childlike features.

Straight men are attracted to feminine features. Women look much like children, except for <i>usually</i> being somewhat larger, and for having breasts and larger arses. There are other visual cues, but they are rather subtle. This is why men have evolved the (slightly unfortunate) instinctive tendency to check out breasts and behinds - it's often the only way a man can be SURE that he is dealing with a sexually mature young female, rather than a child, especially if she is very small.

Fortunately, most male brains have sufficiently finely tuned pattern recognition to hone in on the precisely correct set of features, but others' brains seem to get it wrooooooooong and they end up finding themselves attracted to children. 

If one's sexual pattern recognition locks onto male features, however, I don't think it would be too much of a non sequitur to suggest that he is less likely to be aroused by children.
I may be mistaken, but I'd be willing to bet money on the results if someone were to do a study.

So, the solution to paedophilic churchmen may well be to preferentially recruit homesexual men into the clergy. Not only for the reason above, but also because they could have a sexual outlet in each other, rather than taking out their frustrations on innocent choirboys.

So, it's a 5 Mb game with no graphics beyond coloured ascii text. That's fine. But do you know what it does? First of all, it generates a world. And I mean a world, not the typical 10-mile-at-most across 'worlds' of most computer games. Hideously large. With multiple levels, and complex geology, flora and weather systems. For some FIVE MINUTES, my computer slows to a CRAWL as this tiny application uses pretty much all of the machine's processing power. THEN, it spends another three or so minutes beating the crap out of my machine by simulating a thousand years of erosion and historical development and conflict of civilisations.

And what for?

At the end of it, I'm supposed to choose some tiny, village-sized area of this gigantic world, and send a bunch of seven fantasy dwarves there to establish a trading and crafting outpost. Most of the rest of the world will henceforth have no relevance whatsoever.

"event","So, when I returned from China, I bought a bunch of cigarettes for someone who had specifically requested them. While I was at it, I also bought a bunch of mini cigars, because I could.

I have managed to give most of them away to smokers, but I quickly decided a few weeks ago that I had never been physically addicted to anything yet, and I wondered what the process actually involved. 

Consequently, I have now systematically smoked some fifteen of these things over the last three weeks or so. Observations:

- I am unable to smoke these things normally, as the taste of tobacco is so unpleasant. consequently, I fill my lungs to the brim, and hold my breath for a while. This produces very intense highs (to the point, almost, of temporary paralysis) as well as minimising the time the vile stuff actually stays in my mouth. 

- The nicotine high is intense but tremendously short-lived, the peak lasting only a minute or so. Its short-term nature is particularly annoying considering the vile smoke one had to inhale to get it.

- The high produced has very slightly dropped off over the past two weeks, or perhaps so I imagine. 

- Interesting physiological effects are a clamminess of the extremities and dampening of libido.

- No signs of addiction or even mild craving yet. I look at them and try to imagine desiring them, and can hardly even summon a feeling of intensity equal to the constant mild hunger I feel when presented with any kind of edible biomass. The Lancet medical journal famously reported that nicotine was supposed to be more addictive than heroin, and I begin to wonder whether trying the latter might actually be quite safe.

- I AM, however, becoming accustomed to the taste more.

Would anyone be interested in my last (mostly full) tin? I am so bored of the stuff. I find getting drunk similarly unexciting. Why do people bother with these most popular of drugs?

Hmmm...how does He feel, I wonder, that His birthday and deathday have both been usurped by a fat old saint and an artistically limited rabbit respectively?

"event","I had an intriguing dream, recently. The first I can recall having of its kind.

In it, I was in conversation with a friend of mine, Dario Domizioli. Some of you know him. We were discussing stuff, and we can up with an explanation for the triggering of certain quantum mechanical events that often appear to have no immediate causes and are described as things that have a probability of happening in a certain period of time, whereas the reverse of these events seem to be specifically triggered.

For example, electron capture by protons seems to be an event 'triggered' by the impact of an electron and a proton, but decay of neutrons into protons and electrons seems to be a spontaneous statistical event. This seemed unsatisfactory, so we surmised that there was a parallel (mirror) universe, where a neutron was triggered to decay if a proton captured an electron in this universe, and vice versa.

When I woke up, I thought of the alternative idea that perhaps instead each particle created in the big bang (each of which Physicists believe must have been created with its respective antiparticle) was somehow entangled with its respective antiparticle at its formation, so perhaps all the missing antimatter is out there somewhere, doing an entangled mirror dance with all the matter we can see, and in some crazy antigalaxy out there, exactly the opposite happens of what happens in ours. :D

Actually, this is almost certainly all bullshit, but I am happy to have had such a dream. If only if I could figure out how to trigger more.

I spent several days exploring Beijing, mostly by myself as they were working. It's big. Gigantic. Some 13 million inhabitants. There are no rules of the road, though everyone seems to compensate by driving quite slowly. People spit everywhere. The monuments are magnificent. Toilet rolls have no hole in the middle. As  <lj user=""jackdante""> pointed out, everyone is trying to sell you something, and you have to haggle for almost everything that is not food, and many things that are. And some things that are food are not recognisable as such. Like writhing half-dead scorpions onna stick.

Fortunately, I did not encounter squat toilets until ten days in. But when I did, it was a filthy squat toilet in a moving, shaking train to Shanghai. Baptism by fire. Or poo as the case may be. Was put in mind of THAT SCENE from Slumdog Millionaire. 

Anyway, Beijing. Wear dark trousers. Prepare for your boogers to turn black. Enjoy the lovely dirt-cheap food. One of the most delightful moments of my trip, sadly, pathetically, was when I realised I could magnanimously pay for a sumptuous dinner for myself and some five companions without breaking the bank. This is not to say that food is cheap in real terms - that would be misleading. The vast majority of Beijingers earn very little, so in reality it is just about affordable. But Westerners earning well in Beijing or coming in with foreign currency are simply very, very rich within that environment. It is an important distinction to make.

Nevertheless, while you're there, enjoy your relative wealth. Treat your friends to a stomach-bursting meal for 15 quid. Ride the highly modern and extensive underground for 20p. Take a cab across the entire city for a fiver. Buy the Three Musketeers for less than a quarter the price you would here. And smokers among you, you have just passed through the Pearly Gates. Just remember, if you can, that your wealth is based on the poverty of others.

Many thanks to Marie for documenting this tragic story of hubris and betrayal.

And we watched the extended version of Kingdom of Heaven. You know, the three-hour version with all the PLOT put back in. And now it makes SENSE. And now it's a GOOD film. Even Marie, who saw the cinema release and HATED it then, quite liked it this time round. I plan to force it on all my friends. And we ate pizza and drank cider and showed each other stuff on youtube before it got time to go home so I could go to bed. Definitely going to go bother them again."

Neil brought back homemade cider from Somerset. It doesn't taste particularly alcoholic (cider is often perilous that way), but it does taste dangerous. Specifically, it doesn't taste sweet at all, which means that all the sugar has been metabolised into SOMETHING ELSE.

I had one glass and I am going to watch myself for about half an hour before trying another, in case I get hallucinations or something."

"event","Yes, a good Christmas. On the evening of Christmas Day I met up with Dario and went to <lj user=""daydreamweaver""> and <lj user=""mrwilson"">'s place. We ate too much, and I missed most of a dire Dr. Who Christmas special thanks to a small child repeatedly flinging himself at me. Then the small child was incarcerated in his room, and we played board/card-games 'til late (Stars Are Right and High Society).

Sunday morning, we went bouldering. Dario is definitely far better than I; the man has good technique. Although he still won't stop whingeing about his lack of reach.

In the afternoon, we all went to see Sherlock Holmes, wherein our friend Dan Grey appeared to be in a starring role as the bad guy...and then we went and had dinner at some French Bistro thing in Cabot Circus - they did two main courses for one deals for cinema-goers, and the Duck Confit was divine.

At the end of the week, I fly to Spain!"

In the morning I went climbing for the first time in ages. Dario has far surpassed me (HA! NOT FOR LONG!), and my arms now hurt. 

Then there was the Aikido Christmas party, so we all descended on Brinkhurst Sensei's house, feasted on large amounts of delicious curry prepared by Richo-san (Steve), watched funny Rammstein videos, drove ourselves mad over little metal puzzles, drank, set fire to and inhaled absinthe, played a crazy charades-like board game adjudicated by Sensei's 10 year old daughter Ellie (which my team won) and then when it started snowing some of us went outside and had a snowball fight! For the last thing, my tactics were brutally underhanded, as I tended not to throw my balls but rather snuck up behind people and shoved them down their clothes. Because wars are not best won by attrition but rather by vicious and daring surgical strikes.

When I got home at about 1 AM, I flung a snowball at my housemate as he sat at his computer in the living room (to quote him verbatim: ""Hey, Ludwig, how was yoFUCK!!!!""), then fled cackling into my room and barricaded the door to prevent retaliation."

"event","It rained in England this weekend. To those among you who are of the foreign persuasion, this may seem like a bit of cliche, but when people say 'It rains all the time in England', what they actually means is '<i>drizzles</i>'. Yes, it does indeed drizzle for about half the year in this country, but this weekend, it RAINED. 

According to the Environment Agency, the level of concentrated rain that fell in Cumbria is an event expected to happen only once in a thousand years, and is the greatest since records began.

Fortunately, Bristol was more mildly affected. Nevertheless:

Anyway, pumpkins. I can't find the adapter for the charger for my camera, so I will have post pictures of them later. They are, however, good pumpkins.

"event","My crazy sister took a Monday off, and so we went off into the wilds of the Andean highlands for three days over the weekend. In her tiny toy four wheel drive (actually a very practical vehicle), we drove over the worst roads I had ever encountered. Adding further potholes could have only made the ride more even. For long stretches, water and traffic had created even created waves in the dirt surface perpendicular the the road, so it was like driving over endless little speedbumps. In defence of my spine, I put my seat at a forty-five degree angle for most of the journey. 

Still, as dreadful as the roads were, the landscape was beautiful. We were driving around the Quilotoa loop, a vague ring of roads that connects several quite remote mountain villages and takes one to almost 4 kilometres altitude. It's named after <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilotoa"">Quilotoa</A> volcano, a quasi-extinct beast with a beautiful lake in its crater, which we stopped to visit on the first day. We climbed all the half-kilometre down to the sulphurous lake, and after we had finished poking around my crazy sister took a donkey ride back up. I refused to take a donkey, claiming that I should get some exercise as I had been sitting in a car all day, and I doggedly followed her and the guide up on foot. Almost halfway up, I couldn't keep up any more, but testosteronic pride had possessed me so I continued to refuse the donkey still on offer. I finally made it to the top after many rest stops, some half and hour after my sister, trembling and wet through.

We stopped at various villages along the way, sometimes buying snacks. Local snacks include such healthy delicacies as beans. :( Yum. Beans. In a little bag. As if they were sweets. Just in case those were too healthy, of course, the soft drinks you can buy with them taste poisonously artificial. Fortunately, I'd brought along some Jamon bellota from Spain, and we ate it sitting in the mountain grass above the treeline. 

There are dogs everywhere, all the same size (about as big as you can safely tuck under one arm) with varying degrees of cuteness. Even more no-one's-watching-so-let's-take-one-home were the ubiquitous little black pigs. Come to think of it, all the livestock was rather bijou, just like the humans, as if the thin mountain air didn't let creatures grow very big.

At the village of <A href=""http://www.mip.berkeley.edu/tigua/"">Tigua</A>, we bought some of their famous hide paintings, and at 18:00 of the first evening we ended up at the <A href=""http://www.blacksheepinn.com/TheInn.htm"">Black Sheep inn</A>. My sister had lived in Ecuador for 5 years, and had always wanted to stay there, but had never before found a victim to give her an excuse, as she put it. Frankly, this was the kind of abuse I could learn to live with."

"event","<A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quito"">Quito</A> has the best preserved historic centre of any town in South America. It was designated the first UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Site, along with the historic centre of Krakow, Poland, in 1978. It's as pretty as you might imagine, with some incredible Baroque churches. I spent my first few days wandering around and sightseeing. 

Being some 25 kilometres from the Equator, but at 2,800m, Quito's climate is eternal spring. Sunny, but not hot. It never rains in the morning, but sometimes in the afternoon. The day always lasts 12 hours. My crazy sister, who's lived there 5 years, tells me that it drives you nuts after a while: seasons allow one to gauge the passage of time, but when the weather never changes, you lose track. Has a season passed? A year passed? Two years? Me, I'll take a bit of temporal disorientation over English winters any day.

However, this being the Equator but at altitude, the sun is brutally radioactive around midday. There's a reason EVERYONE wears hats around here - It's on the equator, and the radiation is some 40 %  stronger than at sea level. I, however, refuse to wear hats - in England there is a correlation between hat-wearing people and people I want to smack for reasons other than their hat wearing - so I'd spend the hours around midday in restaurants or cybercafes. You can't throw a rock in Quito centre without caving in a flat-screen.

Speaking of hats, this is the country where the <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_hat"">Panama hat</A> comes from. Not Panama. I bought one at the airport for my housemate. $31. The more expensive ones cost $500, but I'm not that fond of him. :)"

"event","Hi! I'm Ludwig Kayser. You may remember me from 2007 posts such as Help! I've Fallen and the Ice Weasels are Gaining. A one month loss of internet connectivity left me with a backlog of posts and, eventually, a total lack of will to catch up with posting.

Anyway...what's happened over the last 'few' months? Lots, but I can't be bothered to mention it all. Apparently, I'm now a 3rd Kyu. The grading was horrible. I asked to re-do it, but Sensei won't let me. Oh well...2nd Kyu next. 

Oh, and I went to Quito, Ecuador, to visit my crazy sister Uta. Technically, she's my half-sister, but she HATES being called that. I need the ""half"" to explain to people why we don't look much alike except for blue eyes and dimples - people kept on assuming we were a mated pair.

Anyway, my crazy sister works as a lawyer/administrator/warrior for Quiport (Quito airport) - although she should be spending her time organising the transfer to the newly built airport on the edge of town, she mostly fights airlines who don't want to pay their airport fees.

So, after a 12 hour flight during which I killed time by amusing the six-year old girl sitting next to me by spinning coins and making faces (at one point she felt compelled to show me her underwear - why can't I have that effect on older specimens?), I was met at the airport by my crazy sister, who used her corrupt airport powers to speed me through customs. Thus began my South American adventure. More later."

"event","Earlier this year the BBC (I think) had this big national vote-in competition to find out who was the greatest Briton of all time. I can't remember who won, but that's because the whole thing repelled me somewhat because many people had voted for vacuous celebrities.

However, my visit to London reminded of Admiral Nelson, who, in the 1800s, would have won the competition hands down. This man was already and considered a hero even before the battle of Trafalgar, famous for his ability to inspire loyalty in his colleagues and his men, infamous for repeatedly disobeying the orders of his superiors and achieving amazing victories thereby, notable for often leading boarding actions on enemy ships, which is something that high-ranking military officers did not normally do. There was almost no-one in the country who didn't speak of him in awe and adoration. By the end, he had lost an eye and an arm; he would introduce himself ""I am Admiral Nelson, and this is my fin.""

THEN he fought the battle of Trafalgar. After signalling to his fleet the now famous phrase ""England Expects Every Man Will Do His Duty"", he abandoned conventional tactics, ordered his ships to stream straight towards the enemy in two lances, cutting the numerically superior joint French and Spanish fleet in three, but the British fleet being raked by vicious cannonfire all the way and unable to return fire. In close fighting, and the Spanish/French fleet discombobulated by the move and unable to coordinate properly, the British fleet tore the enemy fleet to pieces, and from then on Britannia unquestionably did rule the waves. Nelson was mortally wounded in the heaviest close fighting between the flagships, and died just after the battle was won; the perfect death for a hero. 

What could the British do? They named one of London's grandest squares after his battle, carved a statue of Nelson and raised him (in that square) up to Heaven on a pillar so massive and tall, you can barely see the man from the ground. 

""Rawk"", as they say..."

"event","Well, I have ridden the iron snake back from London! 

My passport renewal at the German embassy was very quick and painless and they say they'll send it me in 6 to 8 weeks. I suspect I'll actually receive it in about 2 weeks. :)

Celia (Spanish girl I know in London) has a seven-year-old daughter called Andrea, whom I had never met before. A clever young lady, fluent in both (admittedly Laaandon) English and (Andaluz - she says ""pa ti"" instead of ""para ti"", for example) Spanish. I'm not very good at talking to children - I never know what approach to take - so I tend to treat them exactly like (slightly dense) adults. With her, at least, it worked very well.

On Saturday evening, she made me watch all her Tom and Jerry cartoons. Not that I minded. I remembered quite a few of them from my youth, and they were still lots of fun. She also got me to watch her favourite film ever, <i>Pocahontas</i>, which I now regret having missed when it came out; it was genuinely good - visually a work of art even - and not as dreadfully schmalzy as I had feared.

To return the favour I then went and bought <i>My Neighbour Totoro</i>, <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i> and <i>Princess Mononoke</i>, the last being one of my three favourite films (next to <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> and <i>The Seven Samurai</i>) for her. No child should grow up and not have been exposed to the works of Miyazaki.

We watched <i>Princess Mononoke</i> and it occurred to me a little too late that a film featuring swearing, leprosy, prostitutes, profuse dismemberment and decapitation, a very high bodycount, horrid tentacle demons and cthulhoid gods of life and death and a social commentary that is very much shades of grey, might not necessarily be appropriate for a seven-year old. But it turns out that children are quite resilient about death, horror and that sort of thing. From what I could tell from her commentary, she was following the plot very well. Afterwards, she said she loved it and it was very beautiful.

My work here is done.


I'm quite grateful that so many of my friends are having children; I should be able to learn much by experimenting on their offspring before I generate my own.

Still, any advice lest I break one?"

Martin came, but only for a short while, and not to join in, as he was busy for most of the evening. He brought along his two little girls, who ran around on the mats, orbiting us in circles for minutes on end as we stretched. Very cute. I wish I could still have tremendous fun just running in circles...

After I went to bed last night, I got a phone call from Steve-sama asking whether I'd like to come to the Yudansha (blackskirt) practices! I said yes.

Turns out that it comes from Haydn's String Quartet in C and is called the Emperor's Hymn. I suppose it had to come from somewhere. The original is very melodious. 

The fact that the two standard melodies played at weddings are those of Wagner (not dreadfully fond of jews) and Mendlessohn (jew) tickles me still. I'm easily amused.

Still, I know own a soldering iron, as well as the fluxed solder to go with it. <lj user=guru_bob> will be jealous. ^_^

Soldering reminded me of days of yore in Libya with my father when we used to sneak across the road from the Bab-el-Bahar hotel to hack the lead lining out of the roofing of demolished buildings. We'd then melt it down to make fun things like...fake coins...and...er...doorstops. Which we also used as shot-puts. And near Christmas, at Silvester-time,  we'd pour molten lead into buckets of water and the strange and sinuous resulting shapes were supposed to foretell one's future.

Inhaling lead fumes is on the list of things that have probably contributed to making me as stupid as I am today, along with falling over my bike straight onto my head (I still have a barely visible scar on my forehead, but no magic powers), and oxygen deprivation due to sleeping under the covers for several years after seeing Aliens; I wasn't afraid of the big ones (no more than lions and tigers and bear, oh my!), but the facehuggers horrified me because I had read quite a few natural history books and that sort of parasitism is quite pervasive in the real world.

"event","One of our Australian Yudansha (blackskirts) is spending a protracted period in Japan, and made some observations. You may find these amusing, and perhaps familiar if you've lived in Japan for a while, as one or two of you have.

-----------------------
Stuff I've discovered from using Japanese in Japan...

1. It actually works! It's pretty surreal to be communicating in a second language. And its awesome fun.

2. Katakana in actually extremely useful. Much more useful than hiragana. All you can ever read in hiragana is ""desu"" and ""arigato gozaimasu"". Katakana you can use for building names, reading restraunt menus and writing your own damn name and OOSUTARARIA on your postcards so they make it back home.

3. Its quite alarming hearing the zaiten-sushi waitress count your plates ""yon-mae""... and you're thinking, wait, did she just say ""That'll be 40,000 yen?! Oh... right... 4 flat things.""

4. No-one ever says ""O genki desuka?"" Actually, the only thing you ever here in the full polite form really is ""Domo Arigato Gozaimasu.""

5. Once you learn the following 3 phrases ""Onegai shimasu"" ""Sumimasen"" and ""Arigato gozaimasu"" you can understand two-thirds of what is being said in Japan. You will still have no idea what is going on.

6. During O-Bon, this changes, and all anyone says in ""O-Bon ne?"" 
If you're gaijin, everyone will attempt to explain O-Bon to you, just in case you are totally brain dead and haven't heard the previous 20,000 explanations of O-Bon. I am so happy that O-Bon is over.

7. No matter how well you say them, Japanese people will not understand the following phrases..... ""No fish."" ""I'm a vegetarian."" ""Please don't put an egg on it, or, god forbid, any mayonaiise."" and ""I don't drink alcohol.""

8. Speaking any Japanese at all makes you instantly friends with all of Japan.

9. If you look at all asian, everyone will assume you speak fluent Japanese. No matter how many times you tell them ""I'm American, I don't understand."" You're Japanese friends will also introduce you as ""not Japanese"".
Example: 1.This is Jess, she works with Larry. This is Daniel, he's a new teacher from Australia. This is Mai. She's NOT Japanese.
              2.  Really? Turns to Mai and says in Japanese You're not Japanese? 
              Mai. I'm American. I don't understand. 

10. ""Nomihoudai"" means all you can drink. It usually costs about 3500 yen and lasts for around 3 or 4 hours. Usually izakayas will also provide a companion ""Tabehoudai"" (all you can eat).
""Nomu biiru.... yottsu!""
""KAMPAI!"""

"event","Having played Bioshock quite a bit now, I have now developed automatic reactions to certain stimuli in normal life. This has happened with other games in the past: with GTA the urge is to leap into empty cars and drive off with them, most first person shooters make me hug walls and scope out corners of rooms I enter for snipers, and Black & White inculcated in me the need to make cryptic but undeniably offensive gestures at people who annoy me. 

But thanks to Bioshock, whenever I now see little girls in the street I feel the need to shoot their fathers, stroke their little heads, then head straight to a vending machine. 

I think that's a good indication of how very WEIRD and WRONG this game is."

"event","I had a dream last night that I remember quite well, which is unusual. I sitting in a large bed with <lj user=guru_bob> and Paul Torrington (who is now teaching Physics to expat brats in Shanghai), and we were all eating from plates of rice. Then we were approached by a rather interesting young chinese lady, chaperoned by an elder sister. After exchanging a few phrases of English and very rudimentary Mandarin, she introduced herself as ""Poet"" and when I asked her what that was in Chinese, she immediately gave me a two-syllable response beginning with ""n"" that somehow made a lot of sense at the time. She carefully and disapprovingly scraped the rice from the edges of my plate to the centre, as I had made a bit of a mess, and then she and I went across the river. I suppose I should stop there for decency's sake. >_>

I've had far more interesting dreams in my time (I've kung-fu fought-mushrooms in suits under Bath abbey, for example) but I so rarely remember them that I think I should record them somewhere when I do. It's odd how effortlessly narrative dreaming is; you writer types might do well to practice lucid dreaming! No more writer's block, although the reviewers might suspect you may have been on drugs...

Aiki was fun last night. It is quite unsettling to train with beginners, as they don't know how they're ""supposed"" to act and react, and you end up being reminded that you're not actually very good at techniques you thought you had got the grip of. This is certainly a good thing.

One thing I'll say about <lj user=aprogressivist> - he may weigh as much as an anaemic chicken, but he has a pin like a vice!"

No one cared what others had to think 
They walked happily down the street
with There nikes tied to there feet
Each step was a skip
And each jump was a flip
 Laughing so hard you thought you would die
Being so loved you thought you could fly
 Thier hearts were so happy how could you ever  sink
Oh in the days when the grass was PINK!

"event","~ TIBETAN PERSONALITY TEST ~

          Take your time with this test and you will be amazed. I did
           this last year when this came around and a spiritual wish I
           made did happen - in fact all year long.



           The Dalai Lama suggests you read it to see if it works for
you.
           Very Interesting.



           Just 4 questions and the answers will surprise you.



           Be honest and do not cheat by looking up the answers. The
mind
           is like a parachute, it works best when it is opened. This is
           fun to do, but you have to follow the instructions very
           closely. Do not cheat.















         MAKE A WISH BEFORE BEGINNING THE TEST!


























A warning! Answer the questions as you go along. There are only
   4 questions and if you see them all before finishing, you will
     not have honest results.







  Go down slowly, and complete each exercise as you scroll down.

       Don't look ahead. Get pencil and paper to write your answers as
         you go along.

           You will need it at the end. This is an honest questionnaire
           which will tell you a lot about your true self. Give an
answer
           for each item. The first thing that comes to mind is usually
           your best answer. Remember - no one sees this but you.


























(1) Put the following  5 animals in the order of your
           preference:  Cow, Tiger, Sheep, Horse, Pig



































(2) Write one word that describes each one of the following:
     Dog, Cat, Rat, Coffee, Sea.

"event","Deep in your heart was an ember of longing 
kept warm by the flame of desire
a dream held in secret i yearned to hold openly
Fanned by my hope into fire
It burned to such heat i could touch it no more 
So i put it away and then closed up the door
Forever extinguishing all that would keep it alieve 
 But the dream never died 
 The lord has done this for me, he has looked on me kindly
He has heard all my cries
He has given me back what i laid at his feet
It must be god, when the dream never dies
Isnt it just just like the lord to invite me 
To put all my dreams in his hands
forever releasing the grip that once held them
 Forever surrendering my plans?
And then he asks me to know in my heart whats not seen with my eyes 
So the dream never dies,

I not only love the hope that is in this song, but also the challenge to ""put all my dreams in his hands"" and ""forever surrender my plans."" 

""love is patient"" (1cor,13:4 )

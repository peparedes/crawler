Been having a lazy afternoon with Gwen in the pool.
We grabbed a float, crawled on and snuggled up and talked most of the afternoon.
Did a little dozing too *chuckles* resting up to start a new Monday.
But sometimes lazy afternoons are what is needed.
hmmm
Already dreaming about next Friday.
*chuckles*

It's good to see Gwen so happy about the baby.
And I'm glad she has been feeling okay so far.
I worry about her and the little one.

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me
Honey, that's no lie

As time goes by,
You will get to know me
A little more better
Girl that's the way love goes
And I know you're afraid
To let your feelings show
And I understand
But girl it's time to let go
I deserve a try honey
Just once
Give me chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey he's nothing like me
Darling why can't you see

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry

No way, no how
I'll make you cry"

Laying around in bed with my wife in my arms.
*GRINS*

Last night after eating our meal that we cooked outside on the firepit we just stretched out in our ""Cocoon bed"" as we call it *chuckles* and cuddled the night away.
The thing I have enjoyed the most about our honeymoon here is having the time to just totally relax and spend time together.
Laying back and enjoying the beauty of this place.
Also spent some time watching her and learning every little mannerism.
Listening to her and learning her hopes and dreams.
I shared with her what my hopes and dreams were too.
It's been nice to have the time to do that.
Know I need to make the time to do that more.

Tonight we will leave here and move on to a luxary villa where we will be close to one of the beautiful beaches here."

She might want to know what to take with her.
*GRINS*
I have been working on it today.
I came across this place that was talking about unusual Romantic honeymoon places.
Seems in Africa they have camps on game preserves where really surprising romantic rooms and cabins are set up for honeymooners. The camp site is surrounded by fencing so people won't get eat up by some of the larger wildlife. LOL LOL
But you still get to enjoy the romantic wilderness and jungles around. And hearing all the WILD sounds around us. *chuckles*
You can enjoy the romantic rooms at night and in the mornings.
Then during the day whenever you want we can go on photo shoot safaris to see the larger animals.

That's right.
I'm taking my sweetie to the WILD SIDE!!!!
*laughs*
We will zap over that night and I think Gwen you will be blown away by the room we have for our wedding night.
Then to end our honeymoon I am taking her to one of the luxury hotels on a beach there.
Now go pack away Brown Eyes!
*GRINS*

The way you make me feel inside You complete me girl, that's why 
Something about you makes me feel 
Baby my heart wants to reveal
 I'm down on my knees, I'm asking you So these three words
 I wanna hear from you

Yes I will, take your hand and walk with you 
Yes I will, so these three words I promise to 
Yes I will, give you everything you need

Yes I will, baby I promise to 
Yes I will, give you everything you need 
And someday start a family with you 
Oh yes I will 
This is no ordinary love 
And I can never have enough
 Of all the things you've given to me
 My heart , my soul , my everything
 Every night I thank you lord(I thank you lord)
For giving me the strength to love her more And more each day
 I promise her 
As long as I hear those three words

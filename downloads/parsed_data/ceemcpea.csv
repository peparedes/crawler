-on break i ran into kara and this amy chick who is pretty goddamn obnoxious and screams ""YOU LOVE HIM"" after i was done talking to my friend Matthew. it was annoying. i might want to punch her out one day.
-went to science and skipped the last half hour because it was a lecture on how to quote things. thanks, i learned that in gr 6.
-more visiting of darryl. in fact, today was just darryl day basically. and i also read, and then pretended to read as i stared at people.

aiight, so work. something always happens at work. example:

guy at work, mid 20's, sorta sketchy, approaches: ""hey...uh... i didn't get your name yet....""

me: *looks down at obvious nametag, looks at guy(who is creepy)*   ""yah, i'm christine.""


this wasn't nearly as good as the time someone thought i had children, here is what happened:


*guy, early 40's with children approaches, asks some question about something, i answer him and play with his 2 little girls.*

guy: ""aw they seem to really get along with you. how many do you have?""

me: ""um...NONE?!?!?!""

apparently, i seem to have had children. this distresses me like you wouldn't believe. it was almost as frightening as the time a man who looked like he'd just walked out of the lions tavern(cracked out, motorcycle-y and fucking old) asked me to marry him and when i said no, asked if we could hang out instead.

"event","hm yah last week ended up sucking so bad. so so so bad. but hey what am i going to do about it now? nothin. on the plus side, i miraculously got into my cottage sans id and sans cover charge. it was like a beam of light shining down from heaven that landed on jaime kyle and becky rockwell( two people i normally dont associate with much) when they beckoned for julia gee and i to join them in the vip line. i jumped at the opportunity and also made it in without so much as a question as to whether i had a stamp or if i was 19 or if i was even a vip. oh what a glorious miracle! unfortunately, my cottage sucks..that was information that couldve been passed onto me before i entered."

"event","its been a while since i updated, i guess i am due. well i work with crazy ass scottish ladies who are apparently falling in love with me and my youth. they call home while at work to tell their family members about me. im a little creeped out. or a lot. sometimes they like to talk about their ""womanly"" problems with me. cut to me puking. ugh i dont even want to write about this anymore, its making me ill.

in other news, ive had a weird week. i got kicked out of rum jungle on saturday...possibly because i was incredibly drunk/i puked...on the patio....yah i would have kicked me out too. i dont really even remember being there. i wonder if i had fun. i went to schoolboy party on sunday....where i was older than a lot of people and not drunk...that made it really not very fun, though it was in an excellent location. i think it was a record, apparently it wasnt broken up until 12:30- 1. thats pretty good, considering every other schoolboy ive been too has been done at like 1130. 

monday's been the best day so far this week. im thinking no other day will really compare:
-worked all day( which sucked but im getting a huge paycheck on friday)
-went to see sleeper and left immediately after as to avoid the kids who were staying for silverstein
-got high with gee mich and kate in port
-went to jailhouse, sang along with the guys who were doing the open mic night and managed not to trip out much.
-randomly visited by a drunk when i got home from port and went for a walk.
-had an amazing sleep due to burn out.
oh monday. how i loved thee.

then the rest of the week's been bad. ive been working like a mothafucka, i had a funeral to go to today, and my brother's moved out. so i miss him. which is weird.
alright, this was long. the end."

i wish there was an elective i could take next year for detective work, or possibly microsoft paint.i bet i would get a 90 on those.i dont actually know what im doing next year.but that i am not on academic probation...and i DO know that i have a job!yes, i'm un-unemployed ...or...employed as most call it. yes, sears hired me. i work in the childrens department. visit me. thanks. i am working with grown women who i will likely have nothing in common with. help me.

"event","so. gee and i have started an experiment. we started it monday at noon. it was to see whether we could stay awake for 72 hours, and if we did, what would happen to us? well. i am now entering hour 38. i am going crazy. seriously. this could be the dumbest thing we have ever attempted to do. i am ready to drop to the floor and sleep for a few days but i can't because i will fail. darryl has made me promise that i won't drive anymore and i don't think that i will. i have started to lose my balance. i have also started to get huge highs and lows...the lows are bad. i almost started crying today because i didnt want to go to the y and again, because darryl wasnt at work yesterday. then there was the whole chilli fiasco. i wont even get started on that. the highs are pretty funny though. i was laughing my head off all day (when i wasnt nearly crying) and everything i said and everything julia said resulted in us becoming hysterical. i miss that kind of crazy. it was great. now i am turning more towards bitter/terrible crazy. if someone were to try to piss me off, id likely rip their head right off. i am not like that normally, ive just become so irritable and sleep deprived that ive turned into a crazy old lady. im starting to hope that julia falls asleep so that i can fall asleep too. i wonder if there are any permanent damages that could result from this? oh please help me.the end."

<P>ooo i did make some progress today: i went to a study group with steph kal and mich. i am proud.i listened. and wrote things down. and didn't really know any of the random mulitple choice questions the ta asked...but at least i left my house and went to it.</P>

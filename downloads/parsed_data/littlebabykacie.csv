Me and lindsey rode around for literally an hour or so..lost in CLIMAX HIGHPOINT hahah. we were on our way to see her mom, got lost, so we turned around..saw an exit for the zoo and decided to go torwards that, turned back around realizing we didnt have any time, so we turned around and took a lovely tour of climax highpoint and it turned out we went in a large circle. it was fun.<br /><br />i don't feel good right now..for multiple reasons.<br />i'm ready for christmas!<br />and...<br /><br /><br /><br /><font color=""#00ffff"" size=""5"">I love Lindsey Truesdale</font></p>"

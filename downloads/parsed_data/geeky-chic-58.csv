ugh!!  i can never go to bed in enough time to get to my class on time and it bothers me.  like right now.  and the class is so big that i know i'll have issues finding a seat again.  but i do like the class...i just won't be able to see to take notes!!  since this is an issue with me, i started reading the textbook (which is actually kind of interesting thank god) and i do have the exam review sheet with me as well.  i'm thinking i'll start doing that if i can't make it to class on time.  see how i do.  because isn't it almost the same????  well...probably not.  but it's not like i'm not learning anything in that time...i will be!!  just from my text book instead..."

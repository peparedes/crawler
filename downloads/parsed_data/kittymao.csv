I did get a picture of Wicket.

<img src=http://mars.walagata.com/w/kittymao/wicket.jpg></img>

Two days ago, he was in the house (ssh!) and rudy and I were watching for strays and Wicket saw a bird on the lawn and accidentally smacked his head into the glass door. doofball.
Strays, you ask?
Why yes.

*animal rights people may not want to hear this...*

We did not find out about them until we had purchased the house. Apparently, the woman who used to live here fed ALL the neighborhood cats, including two fixed feral cats who are a part of some program (their ears are clipped for recognition). So our first night in the house was dismally shattered by the sounds of cats begging for food. 

So, to keep our lawn poop-free, our gutters hairball-free and the whole house cat-free, save for Wicket, we have gone and decided that the only way to keep the cats away was to stop setting out food and scare them at every chance we got- with loud noises, chasing them and other drastic measures. We don't mean to kill or hurt them. We just want them to GO AWAY.

* okay, I'm done, all you animal people.*

Okay. Is there anything else?
Oh. I'm home alone again today. Man, this sucks.
As always. I should do something creative.

We got our house too. yaay! My creative bug is being fulfilled bu painting massive creatures on the bare walls before I paint them over. My b-i-l photographed a gorgeous horse ( full size!) that I painted in his mother's living room. He, on the other hand, painted boobs and penises. har! I alos paintd an easter rabbit and Barney in her room, in protest to the purple she chose for her walls. It's called Romanesque Grape, but I think it should be called Purple Cotton Candy Diabetic Coma. All we could say as we painted was ""Damn. This is REALLY purple.""

So, monday I woke up and decided to go to the city.
And I went. 
I saw jay and julian and Ollie, and caught up on what I missed in the past year. Apparently jay is looking into getting married, which makes me happy and sad for him- he never could find the perfect girl (being his friend for four years, I saw them come and go with much drama), but now I hope he hasn't made the wrong decision. Julian I didn't chat much with, but I felt the best connection to him ( he came from just the next town south of here!) And I really should chat him up next time. Ollie is ollie- quiet, subdued witha good hint of sarcasm. 
the whole reason I went was to pick up my maquette and stopmotion puppet- I'd show you pictures ( the puppet photographs VERY WELL)but I lost the usb cable to the camera. I already ordered one so it should be here any day now. And be sure I'll show you pics. I was worried they'd get thrown away considering I hand't stopped by in a year. So I went- and lo-and behold- just two days earlier Jay almost gave them away. Good thing he didn't or I may have... cried or something.

Anyway, I reworked my portfolio- I will have one just for character designs, and one for puppets/dolls. So That means two portfolios. Which is cool with me. I can focus on individual works, for portfolios. I realize I do need to tighten up my skills, as they can only get better, so I need to keep on the up and up with that.

uhn. Still no sign of even an Inkling of that art doll. It will come, I think I'm just a little scared of it, it'll be one of the hardest one's I've done to date. But when it's done, I hope it will be a piece for my portfolio. Sorry jono, it's taking longer than I expected.

Hm, oh. I got this book called Weird US, and it's got all sorts of local legends from around the country. In order to get me jumpstarted back into drawing, Rudy said that for each one I read I should draw an atc. I've read quite a few, but haven't finished the first ATC. Maybe That's what I'll do today."

"event","It's happened before. It may yet happen again.
From here on in, I'll be using this as a Nervousness page. to remind myself of projects I'm working on, and things I need to get tone in terms of Art. Cause I need a kick in the pants real rough-like.
So-

what do I have?

I do need to do that bird for Jono. I've been lazy about that. I guess it's cause I'm a little confused, but this morning as I laid in bed, I started coming up with some good ideas and I think I'll try them out.

I've also got a trio of Geishas to draw. Very easy, on 5x7. I don't remmeber who it's for right off the top of my head, but yes, those too need to get done. 

Oh and some decos for my yahoogroups. Ak! I love working in decos but making them is becoming a drag.

was there something else? I'll have to check later."

"event","as planned, saw Dawn of the Dead last night. Really, a very good, scary movie. It was very nice, GREAT music choices. I loved how they were sniping off the famous people lookalikes. Oh- the MAKEUP... *drool*. I like how they kept some of the original elements. I like how they took a seperate storyline- rather than consumerism they went with surviving. And the cameos were a riot. I picked up Savini right off the bat, and Max Headroom, but the Black guy from the original took a few seconds... Who was Andy? I know him from somewhere. He looks like a skanky Ted Nugent. Not to say that Ted Nugent's hot... cause God knows he isnt. But.. I'm sure you know what I mean anyway.

Had a snippet of a zombie dream that woke me out of sleep. I was draming along and Poop! A zombie woman, superclose with her flesh all scaling and her bloody, mouth agape... gaak.

So- I'm at Rudy's house. With a towel on my head. Don't be surprised- I wear a towel on my head quite often. At least, when I'm at the Machine. I got out of the shower about 20 mins. ago and keep the towel on so I don't drip wethair water all over the place. I wait a bit before I blowdry my hair.

Uhm. Had a mango fer breakfast, I have a burrito waiting for me in the fridge. I was supposed to eat it during the movie, but I just got sucked in. You know how it goes.

What else? I don't know. Hmm.

"event","Gonna catch the train to Rudy's today. Oo. I like the train. There's something about it. It's so polite and proper and nice and civil-quiet. Not like the City trains I usually catch which are full of urine-smelling bums and loonies and disgruntled commuters. I'm not worried about leaving my stuff unattended on the Gilroy train. 
Heey, my mummy just brought me apple-juice. TWO DIFFERENT KINDS! How cool is that? I lubs my mum. Now I can take one on the train... I also want to have some extra cash to get a bagel when I get on- they're so chewy and soft- steamed bagels rock.

Uhm- Class last night was interesting. I'm doing so well on the one project, he's given me another to try out. How cool, huh? Ee! Well maybe- Now that I think about it, maybe I'm behind and he wants me to do more work?! Ak! Am I great or Terrible?! 

see. I told you I think too much.
*shrugs* 

I'm supposed to see Dawn of the Dead tonight. The New one. I hear it's good. So I'm excited. I still kick myself for not seeing it opening night. I also want to see Hellboy. Sigh! The makeup looks AWESOME! *drool*

Well, I should get to shoving off. My mum said we were gonna go to Costco, and I'm excited to get some (okay... a LOT!) of tasty healthy stuff. I am probably not going to write at all this weekend. With Rudy, not like last week. We're gonna look for apartmants in the Cruz- and maybe hang out down there too.

"event","I wanted to puke this morning. I pondered not even going to school. But I sucked it up jumped on the train and I actually feel a little bit better- thanks to the NectarFizz. Yum. I gots me some cheez-its sitting next to me and I really am pondering lunch ASAP. That burger from Jasmine's was fat rockin'...I may want one again.

But I kinda need to hold off on spending- I got my last $20 in my pocket from my school loans for expenses and school isn't even over yet. I mean, I am working but- well... I when thrugh this whole toalk yesterday so I'm not gonna rehash. It just sucks. plain and simple.

I need to make a fiery print,( that's like... three bucks.) and go to Britex. I don't want to spend more than ten, but I think it's gonna push it. Oo, notions... rock. So Today's kind of a busy day- not just yet though. After Lunch. 

Lunch. rawr. 
Just so you know- food is a very important thing to me. I'm not a blimp or anything- I'm particularly active... I just love sating hunger pangs. 
So is my music and my Showers.
Oo, I had THE BEST SHOWER last night. The water was nice and hot and I was cold and it was just... ah.
I bet I sound like a superdork.
Well, I don't care. It's what I like so- nyaah.

Monday night's class was so inspirational- I want to animate so badly and make puppets and get paid for it and I'm so excited to get a real job doing work and... ee!

Hm. I should get to going. I mean- I don't want to go, but I don't want to sit in front of the computer and be such a nerd when all my friends are chatting and hanging about. Nyark.

"event","slept till 11. didn't want to wake up, but Rudy called and we talked a little bit. He was on break at work, and was eager to talk cause I didn't get to see him this weekend. 
Which totally sucks. 
But I'm gonna take the Train to see him Thursday. It'll be the second time I'll ever have been on the train... I liked it SOOO much the first time. Only problem is-it's $12 bucks to get there and I REALLY need to save my cash until my Park check comes. Which is at the end of the month. And I get paid monthly. It's such a crock. I can't wait to quit.

Well, that's not entirely true. If I got paid better, and the place was open all the time, then I'd love working there. But $7 an hour for 6 hours, one day on the weekend... let's face it folks, it's a total crock and I can't handle it. I'm lucky my mum gives me trainfare for school- otherwise I couldn't hack it at ALL.

But I love the animals. The ckickens and the ponies- even that bastard of a goose has a soft spot in my heart. Oh!
Next weekend I get to work with animals- not at work, but at school, for the animal-drawing day. And I'll get paid a model's wage, which is $13 an hour, for like... 8 hours of work! That makes me SO happy. It's nearly twice my wage at a FULL-TIME day, doing EXACTLY what I normally do... if not easier! Ye-ayr! rock.

yea. Uhm. was there something else?
I had a weird dream but can't recall it.
Not like the night before where I had a great dream, and can't rememeber it. You know... you just wake up with the residual feeling of the dream and just FEEL if it's good or bad. Or weird, as in my case.

I've got a juicy soft mango waiting for me at the table, so I'm gonna go have breakfast. Yea. At noon. I love it.

I figured I'd write now, cause I don't know if I can write when I get home- it'll be late and I'm stupid-tired. The eye burning and the arm fatigue and the lot of it.

I turned in my negs today. I didn't get to see them, but I'll see them wednestday and I hope they rock. I also got my clay and pixillation projects from that retarded imac upstairs. Not to say that macs suck. I'm on one now (so pardon the spelling!)and they're nice. But that one upstairs just has some MAJOR issues and I needed to draw files off to even freaking render them. 

Oh, and class was cancelled today- pop culture. Which means I won't be able to figger out how that misfits report went. Caca. But at least I got some time for a real lunch. I'm temped to get a burger at Jasmine's- but  who knows. Blarg.

"event","they put down oreo today. I said goodbye to him. Well- I didn't say anything to him, really. And I shouldn't have expected him to snuggle and snuffle me- though I did want him to. But, you know... that's oreo. He doesn't really like anyone. excuse me... he didn't really like anyone.

*sigh*

I have to find my porfolio clips. I wonder where they are. Should I just take the tape and digitize it? I don't really want to do that- that would take forever... but I don't know if I can do it elseways. Hm. Well, I'll defenitely take the tape, and I'll try and hunt down the clips- if I don't find them, then so be it.

I wonder how my report washed over. I don't think I did so great on the test, but here's to hoping the reoprt rocked fat ass. I did it on the Misfits, dontchaknow. Makes me want to have grown up in the 70's- be Punk and everything.

Cause, let's face it- I'm no punk. I'm barely metal. I guess- I just AM. 
Which is fine by me. In High School, your music dictated your lifestyle. 
In college... it's just kind of... whatever. Though the meaning for self expression in Art College is strong- it's just... you're not here to star in a fashion show ( well, unless you're a fashion major but that's a WHOLE OTHER can of worms...)you're here to learn...

I felt there was something else I wanted to say, but I don't really recall. Blagh. That's the way it goes.

"event","got called in to work. I was gonna go to the flea market, but I felt so guilty- to think that while I'd be less than a mile from work, enjoying myself, they'd be struggling to make ends meet. It's okay though, work wasn't all that bad.

A sad note though- they're going to have to put Oreo down. His liver is failing and he's been peeing blood and chunks as of late. So- either Monday or Wednesday, he's gonna go to the big green pasture in the sky. 
He deserves it. 
Not to die.
But to be free.
He's twenyt-two, pretty old for a pony, but was the physical picture of health, despite his stabbing about five years ago. Mentally, he's a little out of it, but wouldn't you be if you'd been living behind bars for 17 years?

Spent some time with Ruby too. The more I see and hold her, the more I adore her. I need to get me a chicken.

Uhm. Yea. I have some homework to do. Negative animation. Not hard, just tedious. Veeeeeeeeeeery tiny pictures. I can hear my wrist screaming now.

I also whipped up a couple of wallpapers for Santharia. I liek them, but haven't gotten any comments on them yet. I hope they're a smash. ya.

"event","I can't see when it hurts.
I can't breathe without hurting.
I can't see while I'm breathing.

It steals your breath and it holds you down,
It takes your life and gives a crown.

Nay not, say it again.

And last night, for the briefest moment, I felt the world beyond these four fucked up walls, padding torn to shreds and stained with a thousand self-inflicted genocides.  I felt it.  These walls no longer contain me, they are but rust encrusted cellophane, and I have been beyond them.""
""They were right,"" he answered calmly, ""you <I>are</i> insane.""
I smiled, content, reading the secret jealousy in his faux-concerned face."

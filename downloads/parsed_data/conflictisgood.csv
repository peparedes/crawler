um, what?

Steve was the head of production on one of our new series.  He and I were cracking each other up via email last week.  I sent him 2 emails and left a voicemail yesterday afternoon.  I wondered this morning why he hadn't responded.

I'm just staring at the screen now.  Maybe if I hit ""update"" this will go away."

"event","one of my guilty pleasures is a daily check of my ""gold box"" on Amazon.
if you're not a regular Amazonian, perhaps you are unaware of this little nugget of joy.

each day, Amazon places 10 discounted items in your gold box.  you can choose to buy one or pass on all of them.  over the last few years, I've probably purchased about 5 gold box items, but I check it almost daily.

presumably, your gold box items are selected by Amazon based on your ""preferences"" (some ephemeral notion that Amazon develops based on your past searches and purchases).  as a general rule, the items in my gold box are CDs, books, DVDs and the occasional power tool.

today, the 10th item in my gold box was a fucking badminton shuttlecock.  WTF?  who the hell goes to Amazon to buy shuttlecocks?  and, more importantly, who the hell thought I'd want one (even at a deep discount)?

damn."

"event","<P>last night, around 9pm, my friend L (who lives down the street with R) called. ordinarily, L's phone conversations commence with the requisite pleasantries (how are you? what are you guys doing?). this time, with a hint of depression in her voice, she asked ""what do you know about possum babies?""</P>
<P>um, nothing. why?</P>
<P>her dog had cornered one in their yard and she felt it was critically injured, if not already dead, and she didn't know what to do. R was distraught. I said I'd be right over.</P>
<P>now, if you know me, you know I'm the biggest softy for all things animal. I prefer animals over people. G once asked me to describe my idea of a perfect day (after she had described her perfect day of lounging around reading a book). within the first 30 seconds of my ""perfect day"" description, I was rescuing hawk babies (at the time she posed the question, we had a neighborhood hawk who at been floating around in the updraft over our house, so I imagined what would happen if he/she had babies in need of rescue. it sounded like something that would make me happy).</P>
<P>anyway, I went over to help. I arrived to find R &amp; L standing in their back gate. They silently directed me in and pointed to a small, gray, fuzzy thing next to the fence. I asked for a flashlight. R went into the house and returned with a flashlight. I knelt down next to the fence and shined the light upon the victim, a baby possum, eyes open. L pointed to a box that they had already prepared with towels. ""Is it dead?"" I hesitated, not wanting to respond. ""...no, it's still alive."" Both R &amp; L sighed.</P>
<P>I could tell it was still breathing. I took one of the towels and started to touch the baby, who was still warm. I wrapped the baby in the towel, talking to it the entire time (""I know baby. It'll be okay. Don't worry. I'll help you.""). I placed the baby in the box and closed it. L asked ""What are you going to do?"" I'm not sure. ""Are you going to bring it back to life?"" she asked, trying to smile. I grinned and said it'd be okay.</P>
<P>On the short drive home, I was trying to figure out what to do, trying to think of the fastest way to put the baby out of its misery. I pulled into the driveway and took the box out of the car. G emerged from the house. I told her to go back in. She immediately knew what was happening and asked to stay with me. I erupted into tears and demanded that she go back in.</P>
<P>I went to the end of the driveway, looking for a dark place to be alone. I opened the box. No movement. I was a little relieved, thinking that nature had done the job for me. I reached into the box and picked up the swaddled possum baby...it was still warm....and still breathing. It opened its eyes and looked at me.</P>
<P>With one of the small towels, I examined the baby. Covered in dog slobber. One small scrape, but no blood. I felt for broken bones. Nothing. And no sudden movements from the baby. I kept expecting it to cringe or hiss if I touched something that was broken. Still warm. Wait...still warm?</P>
<P>I thought back a year ago to one of my cats being attacked by neighborhood dogs. Even though she was moving around afterward (obviously in pain), she was stone cold. The vet said that internal bleeding reduces body temp.</P>
<P>Warm baby = less likelihood of internal injury. Still bawling, I set the baby down on the driveway so that I could wipe away tears. The second I did so, the baby scooted off under my car!!! I immediately started squealing with glee! ""You've been playing possum!!!"" After a few minutes of possum herding and round up, I finally caught the baby again. Still warm. No unusual breathing (not rapid, not shallow). Still no reaction during the ""broken bone"" exam.</P>
<P>I wrapped the baby up and placed it back in the box. I decided to set it free in a vacant lot behind a church at the end of our street (the church never maintains their property, so it's really bushy and overgrown...a perfect place for a possum to live). I ran into the house to explain to G what happened. She walked down to the church with me. We opened the box and I removed the baby again. I checked it out one more time. Still warm. Still no reaction to my poking and prodding. I set it down on the ground. Slowly, the baby walked off into the vacant lot, into the weeds and bushes.</P>
<P>I ran home and called L. She sounded relieved.</P>
<P>I hope the possum baby is okay. I assume that since it wandered into R &amp; L's yard that it's old enough to find food for itself.</P>
<P>I hope I did the right thing. </P>"

"event","For the last two days, I've been exchanging emails with my best friend from elementary school.  I'd only spoken to her once since the seventh grade (when I moved).  I recently found out she was teaching at a nearby private school.  Sent an email to her at the school and a flurry of communication ensued.  We've discovered that, despite not seeing each other for a couple of decades, we have several friends in common and we get our hair cut at the same salon.

Today, I received a random email from a guy who went to law school with me.  Hadn't heard from him in 13 years.  Out of nowhere he emails to say hello.

An hour ago, a friend from high school called to tell me that another of our friends died this morning.  39 years old.  Had 3 kids, one of which was 10 months old.  She was putting gas in her car when she suddenly felt ill.  She called her husband (a guy I used to work with at Six Flags in the 80's).  She finished pumping the gas, got back in her car and started to drive home, still talking to her husband.  About 2 blocks from home, she told her husband that she was suddenly dizzy and couldn't see.  She wrecked her car.  The coroner is certain that the wreck didn't kill her.  They're trying to determine if it was a stroke or heart attack.  39."

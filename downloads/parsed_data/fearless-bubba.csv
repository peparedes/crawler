Mine."">Type your cut contents here.</lj-cut><br /><br /><br /> 144 weeks ago I last was on live journal and updated. April 10th, 2006. Nearly 3 years ago. Wow. Time has gone so fast.<br /><br />I remember when LJ&nbsp;was popular. It's now been shunned by myspace, facebook, and blogspot. It's a sad, sad world. Whatever happen to the good ole days? Seriously.<br /><br />Time goes too fast. I mean, I was 17 years old when I last posted. I am now nearly 21. It's crazy crazy crazy. <br /><br />I think we should bring back the LJ!!!!!<br /><br />I waste my time...<br /><br />no one will ever read this :(<br /><br /><br />Ps: I seen Gran Turismo tonight. amazing movie. I love.love.love Clint Eastwood, he is an amazing actor. Being so far in age, he still nails his roles. Go see it if you haven't already, Its a 5 star movie to me anyway,."

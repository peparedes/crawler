Mark Hamil is 61. Luke Skywalker is only two years younger than Obi Wan Kenobi was when <i>Star Wars</i> came out.

Ralph Macchio is 51. This means the Karate Kid is now the same age Mr. Miyagi was when the movie came out.
 
Lisa Whechel is 49.  This means one of the <i>Facts of Life</i> girls is only two years younger than one of the <i>Golden Girls</i> was when it premiered.
 
Alex Winter is 47. Kenau Reeves is 48. Bill and Ted are only four years younger than Rufus was when <i>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</i> came out.
 
Whil Weaton is 40. Wesley Crusher is older than every crew member of The Enterprise except for Picard was when <i>Star Trek the Next Generation</i> premiered.

Mark-Paul Gosselaar is 39.  Zach Morris is the same age Mr. Belding was when <i>Saved by the Bell</i> premiered.
 
The present in Back to the Future (1985) is now almost as far in the past as 1955 was when that movie came out."

I received a piece of mail today from a group calling itself Americans for Limited Government purporting to be a ""Vote History Audit"" listting me and all of my neighbors and whether or not we voted in the 2004 and 2008 elections, along with a threat to send out a similar report in 2012.

Excuse me, a ""vote history audit""?  WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TO PRESUME TO SIT IN JUDGEMENT OF MY DECISIONS WHETHER OR NOT TO VOTE!?!?!

And to make matters worse, you fuck ups didn't even get the information right.  You report me as not having voted in 2004.  I most certainly did vote in 2004.  AT THE ADDRESS I WAS LIVING AT THAT YEAR.  So not only are you self righteous pricks being creepy stalkers, but you've also slandered me in front of all of my neighbors by telling lies about me.

<TABLE ALIGN=""CENTER"" BGCOLOR=""#C0C0C0"" WIDTH=""75%""><TR><TD>It was obvious to the chaplain now that he was not particularly well suited to his work, and he often speculated whether he might not be happier serving in some other branch of the service, as a private in the infantry or field artillery, perhaps, or even as a paratrooper.  He had no real friends.  Before metting Yossarian, there was no one in the group with whom he felt at ease, and he was hardly at ease with Yossarian, whose frequent rash and insubordinate outbusts kept him almost constantly on edge and in an ambiguuous state of enjoyable trepidation.  The chaplain felt safe when he was at the officers' club with Yossarian and Dunbar, and even with just Nately and McWatt.  When he sat with them he had no need to sit with anyone else; his problem of where to sit was solved, and he was protected against the undesired company of all those fellow officers who invariably welcomed him with excessive cordiality when he approached and waited uncomfortably for him to go away.  He made so many people uneasy.  Everyone was always very friendly toward him, and no one was ever very nice; everyone spoke to him, and no one ever said anything.</TD></TR></TABLE>"

"event","People who know me well are probably aware that one of my biggest character flaws is that I'm extremly cynical and alienated.  It just seems to me that the older I get, the more it seems that there is nothing truly noble or virtuous in this world; everything that seems to be is just a facade and believing in anyone or anything just leads to eventual betrayal when their true nature is finally revealed.

It's a lesson that was underscored for me yet again this weekend, as one of the few things I still had any faith in turned out to be built upon horrors that even I couldn't have imagined.  I have, since I was a little kid, been a follower of Penn State football.  My dad graduated from the University and as I was growing up, some of my most cherished memories involve weekend trips to Penn State games.  As I grew up, I eventually went to the university myself.  I'm a season ticket holder and do my best to make it to two or three games a year.  I actually (quite foolishly as it turned out), believed all that ""Success with Honor"" crap.  That this was one of the few major programs that still believed that winning doesn't mean anything if you don't win the right way, and that at the end of the day, character matters more points.

And then this Friday that all came crumbling down:

<A HREF=""http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2011/11/5/2540022/sandusky-charged-in-child-molestation-case-curley-and-senior-admin"">Sandusky Charged In Child Molestation Case, Curley And Senior Admin Charged With Perjury</A>

For more than a decade, a sexual predator was using the program to lure children so that he could rape them, first as an assitant coach and then through a children's charity.  The university knew of this and covered the whole thing up.  And aside from those legally responsible for this is a larger group of people who seem to have done the minimum legally required and then washed their hands of it, when basic morality would suggest they had a duty to do far more to stop this.

And while the biggest tragedy here is certainly the children who were victimized, on a smaller level I'm incredibly angry that these people had to destroy something I cared deeply about.  To take something that was great and make it just like everything else in this crappy world.

And once again I feel another corner of idealism roughly round off.  I grow a little more suspicious, a little more bitter, and a little more angry, and I'm sure it will continue until there's nothing left.  ""To steel the heart against itself ... is a stern task of soul: - No matter, - it is taught."""

<table align=""CENTER"" bgcolor=""#C0C0C0"" width=""75%""><tr><td><b>In a Parish</B>

Were I not frail and half broken inside,
I wouldn't be thinking of them, who are, like me, half broken inside.
I would not climb the cemetery hill by the church
To get rid of my self pity.
Crazy Sophies,
Michaels who lost every battle,
Self-destructive Agathas
Lie under crosses with their dates of birth and death.  And who
Is going to express them?  Their mumblings, weepings, hopes, tears of humiliation?
In hospital muck and the smell of urine,
With their weak and contorted limbs,
And eternity close by.  Improper.  Indecent.
Like a dollhouse crushed by wheels, like
An elephant trampling a beetle, an ocean drowning an island.
Our stupidity and childishness do nothing to fit us
For this variety of last things.
They had no time to grasp anything of their individual lives,
Any <i>principium individuationis</i>.
Nor do I grasp it, yet what can I do?
Enclosed all my life in a nutshell,
Trying in vain to become something
Completely different from what I was.

Thus we go down into the earth, my fellow parishioners,
With the hope that the trumpet of judgment will call us by our names.
Instead of eternity, greenness and the movement of clouds.
They rise then, thousands of Sophies, Michaels, Matthews,
Marias, Agathas, Bartholomews.
So at last they know why
And for what reason?

--Czeslaw Milosz</TD></TR></TABLE>"

Whoever made the trailer did a terrible job at capturing the movie, because it ended up being a far better movie than even the original.  While there's certainly still humor in it, the tone as a whole was far more serious and the major characters have developed in a way that's unusual to see in franchise animation films.

I'm looking forward to the next one, especially give that the second one was apparently the first in a planned five story arc."

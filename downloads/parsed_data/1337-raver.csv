"event","today officially sucked.  i was over in concord today, picking up sarah's birthday gift, when i got a phone call from a friend of mine that works at a car dealership out there, telling me to swing by later.  i told him i was in the area, so he said to meet him at the dealership and we'd go grab some lunch.

well, we went to lunch and got back.  he had to get back to work, so i headed off to where i had parked.  on my way to my car, two guys approached me and, seeing me smoking, asked if i had a couple of extra smokes.  i said yeah, and reached into my pocket, when i looked up, one of them had pulled a knife on me and told me to give him all my money too.  i handed it over to him and they booked it out of there.  i halued over to my car and called the cops, had to wait about 20 minutes for them to show up, then gave them a report.  they didn't seem very optimistic, but said they would call me if anything turned up.

this had to have been the worst day of my life..."

"event","well, it's been a while, so i should probably update.

i'm still working at Trader Joe's, and things are going ok there.  i'm eligible for benefits there now, and it's gonna cost me a whopping (note sarcasm) $47 a month for medical, dental, and vision combined.  good times.

sarah and i are still together, and things are even better than ever with the addition of my new cell phone, that comes with unlimited minutes to her phone  ^.^  w00t w00t!

ummm, not sure what else is going on, so that's about it for now......

OH!  If any of you  want my new cell #, message me and i'll send it to you."

"event","Well, it's been a while, so I figured I was long overdue for an update.

I re-met a lovely little lady back in August named Sarah, and she means more to me than anything.  It's amazing how well she and I click together, and I've never had more in common with anyone else in my life.  I feel like my good friend Kenny, having found my twin ^.^  And though we've hit some rough spots in the past week, we've worked through them, over them, and past them.  They've also allowed us to open up more to each other, and that's not a bad thing now, is it? <3

I lost my job at BevMo back in July due to a technicality, spent some time on unemployment, and now I work for Trader Joe's, making more per hour as a crew person there than I was as a manager at BevMo.  Good times.

My art is constantly improving, especially with the additions of Adobe's Photoshop, Image Ready, and Illustrator, courtesy of another good friend, Griff.  Most of all, my art site has really picked up, having broken 1,000 pageviews in just over a year.  That means alot to me, showing that people at least find my art interesting.  You can see it for yourself here:  http://t3hgauness.deviantart.com

Anyways, off to do other things."

"event","man, where do i start?

well, for the first time in a long time, i'm happy, and I have a very special little lady named Sarah to thank for it.  ^.^  who'd have guessed that i would meet the love of my life 2 years before i realized it?  i know that a long time ago i said that i hate going to bed with someone on my mind, but i take that back, cause now i can't get enough of it.  she's the diving force in my life now.  i get up every morning, looking forward to talking to her into the wee hours that night.  even though we're far apart, even though this is all new, i'm full of hope and confidence for our future.  everything she tells me, every word she speaks or types, just makes me love her even more.  every time i see her name or face, i can't help but smile.  everytime i remember her, my heart fills up more.  i can't even express to her how much i love her, but i know that one day i will be able to.

i love you Sarah, with my heart, my soul, and every essence of my being, and i always will.  never forget that my precious kitten ^.^"

"event","yeah.  it's gonna be one of THOSE entries.

i suppose i should start at the beginning though.

a few months back, a certain someone led me to believe that there was hope of rekindling our relationship.  it took alot of self-restraint to not run out a get a loan so i could move, but i fought back those urges.  nonetheless, this had become a driving force in my life.  so when i learned that one of my best friends was getting married, i saw this as an opportunity for some rekindling.

well, the wedding went fine enough.  we were close, and i couldn't help but flirt with her, but got little reciprocation back.  after the wedding we went to the club.  that was fun, until she showed me a text she had sent to her friend that had just visited her.  the text was a pic of my friend and his new wife during their first dance with the caption ""this could be us someday"".  yeah, that one hurt alot.  we left pretty quick after that and she took me back to my other friends apartment, where i made the stupid mistake of asking ""would you be terribly upset if I kissed you"".  her response was ""probably"".  that was it for that night.

the next day she started text messaging me, telling me she did want to kiss me, but that my smoking bothers her.  we bantered back and forth and i told her that i'd give anything to be with her, if not forever than at least for one night.  she said that she couldn't do that, that my ""friendship"" meant too much to ruin with meaningless sex.  yeah, that made me feel good, having sex with me referred to as ""meaningless"".  she said she's trying to get herself temple worthy so she can be married in the mormon temple, somewhere i can't.  somewhere i won't.

so it breaks down to her talking about ""rekindling"" and ""giving us a try again"" being nothing more than lies.  fabrications.  complete fiction.

so i reach a turning point in my life.  i'm done.  done with having my emotions played with.  having my heart toyed with like a puppet.  i want someone who wants to be with me, not just use me for my emotions.  so now a five year period of my life finally comes to an end.  i've known that i needed to move on, but now i'm finally ready to."

"event","Well, it's been a while, so I figured I might as well post, as well as vent some steam.

I'm still at BevMo, didn't get my sales license, and I can't even re-apply until january, 2007, and even then I might not get it.  So I'm still working at BevMo, and things have gotten slightly better.  I'm in charge of the beer department at my store and my manager got me into the BevMo Beer Ambassadors (a group of employees that taste and rate beers).  But the biggest thing happened shortly after the holidays when my manager told me that he wanted to make me a head clerk.  He said the only thing holding me back was my temper, and that I needed to work on it.  So I started working on it, but he went and hired somebody else, someone who's never worked for the company before.  He told me the reason he didn't promote me was because he ""couldn't take a chance"", but apparently he could take a chance with someone he's never worked with before.  Grr, very irksome.

So yeah, some good things though.  Kat and I had a little conversation, in which she said that if I get back to Utah, we could possibly give ""us"" a try again.  And I've gotta tell you, that was one of the happiest days of my life.  Having a chance to be back with the one person that I was truly happy with....it's more than I can describe.  I mean, this is the girl that I've been pinning over for damn near 5 years now, mentally kicking myself in the ass over and over again for what I did.  This is the girl that I would have given anything to be with again, and now I've been given the opportunity!  God, if only I could get back out there, but I need to save money first, and to do that, I need a better paying job.  The dealership would be perfect, because I could cave money no problem, but that's 9 months away, and I need something now.  Hmm, maybe I should start playing the lottery.  Or try to get on a game show.  WHouldn't that be nice.

Ah well, I'm getting tired and I've got work tomorrow.  Another day in paradise.....or is it more like purgatory?"

"event","""So.

Here I sit, at my computer, wondering why I still deal with all of this shit.  Why I deal with all of the stupid chat rooms, full of idiot spammerz who feel it is their duty to annoy the fuck out of me and my friends.....oh well, nothing I can do about that.

Chantel.  Chantel won't talk to me.  I haven't even talked to her in about two weeks now.  I'm worried.  Worried if she maybe got hurt somehow.  But more than that, I'm worried that she found someone else.  Or that she just grew tired of me.  I shouldn't be worried though.  It's not like this is anything new.  I should be used to rejection by now.  Because no matter what I do, someone elsewill come along who's better than me in every way imagineable.

I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.  Should have figured that God was just testing me again.  Testing me for whatever he has planned for me.

Someone told me, last October at a Lord of the Rings Halloween party that I had gone to as Strider, that God had a plan for me.  That I would face many hardships in my life.  But that they were to prepare me for what his plan was.  In all honesty, I think I've faced enough.  I've been uprooted from the places where I have been most comfortable twice.  I have had my heart broken numerous times by one person, the person I thought I was going to be with forever.  I've lost jobs, friends, my entire life.  But I doubt that any of it has made me stronger.

I don't know what my life has in store for me, but I'm gonna face it with my middle finger forward and a cigarette between my lips.

Fuck you world, and everything you can throw at me.""




I wrote that on October 6, 2003, back when I was on Xanga, and didn't really use it.  I read that after finding my link on someone else's site, and I got to thinking, ""what's happened in the pas two years?""

Well, first and foremost, I haven't spoken to Chantel since then, so no real change there.  Secondly, I met another girl online shortly there after, and just after that, I ended up moving back to Utah.  What an experience that was.  Living with one of my oldest and closest friends, I thought it would be awesome, but I was wrong.  Like so many other people in my life, he too screwed me over.  I laster there only about 5 months.  And it was a rollercoaster ride the entire time.  Good times, followed by bad times.  I stabbed one of my friends in the back, leaving her to follow some other girl (but you know i love you Coca).  I fell in and out of love so many times out there.  I was unstable.  Constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown with no one to stabalize me.  My roommate and friend was either getting drunk or fucking his girlfriend.  The same holds true for one of my other friends, minus the fucking, cause he's just.....weird.  The only people that cared about me while I was out there were Griff and Dani.

Griff.  He'll be my best friend till the day I die.  When I was engaged to Holly (for the brief time that it was), I'd asked him to be my best man.  And I'll do it again too.  Because I know that he'll always look out for me.

Dani.  My surrogate little sister.  The one that, if she'd let me, I'd date, no questions asked, because she needs a good guy to treat her right.  It hurts me always seeing her date these assholes that treat her with no respect.  But, as she says, ""incest is not best"", so nothing I can do about that.

Love.  Time to cover this subject.  In these past two years, I need to mention all the girls that I've wished I could've been with:
-Angie
-Jamie
-Raven
-Dani
-Kat
-Amber
-Caroline

Damn.  That's alot for only two years.  And I'd like to point out that I have no chance with any of them.  Ah well, nothing to do about that.

Work.  In two years, these are the jobs I've held:
-McDonalds
-Convergys (AOL)
-Teleperformance (Sprint)
-Target
-Q4 Marketing
-Antioch Toyota
-Beverages & More

7 jobs in two years.  That's just sad.

So here's where I sit now.  Single, working a dead-end job, with no good outlooks on either front.  So I'm still facing forward, with my middle finger up and a cigarette between my lips.

"event","yeah, some more emo shit again.  sitting at home last night, and i remembered that i needed to plug my cell phone in.  so i plug it in and turn it on to let it charge.  i always have it on while i'm asleep, in case someone needs to get a hold of me (not text me at 3 am claiming to be a sex god.  i hate you kenny) anyways, i turn it on and it beeps at me like mad.  got the final three updates from the sharks game, a picture mail from kat, and a voice mail from her as well.  well, the pic, i couldn't really make it out.  all i had to go on was the caption, ""wish you were here"".  so i called her.  turns out she had gone to area last night, and sent me a pic from the club.  yeah, i do wish i was there.  for several reasons.  a few of which aren't healthy.  then she started talking about him, and i felt that little monster start to wake up inside me.  i had to go.  told her i was falling alseep.  but the truth is, my mind wouldn't let me sleep for almost an hour.  my mind kept working, not giving me any peace.  all i wanted was to go to sleep, but it keep asking ""why can't i let her go?"" over and over again.  and i know why i can't, but i also know why i should, which is why i find myself in a delicate conundrum:  i find myself chasing something i shouldn't, for a reason i shouldn't.  i can't be what she wants.  she wants someone that can take her to the temple.  but that'll never be me.  never.....and that the thing that kills me.  no matter how much i wish i could be, i can't.  i doubt that even if i was able to do the things she wanted to do and be the person she wanted, that she would take me back.  i guess....i'll always be ""just a friend"" now.  but there's things that i've needed to say for a while now, so here goes.

Kat Roberts (cause you'll always be a Roberts' to me), I love you.  Always have, and I probably always will.  If I could, I'd go back, change everything I did that pushed us apart.  But I can't.  I did what I did, and nothing can undo that now.  These are things that I have to live with.  And if the only way I can be close to you is simply ""as a friend"", then I guess there's nothing I can do about that."

"event","Ok, time for some late night rantings induced my Mountain Dew: Pitch Black II:

I have recently joined deviantart.com, and earlier tonight, i clicked over to the mainpage and this is what I saw:

http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/23901573/

Now, in my caffiene-enduced insanity, I felt the urge to verbally abuse this guy to no end.  Seeing as someone had already gotten the ball rolling, I decided to roll with it.  This is how it breaks down:

cobainsriff (some random person) - why did u post this on an art website
exorcismofevil (the artist) - why not?
t3hgauness (me) - because this isn't art. this is some pathetic person, living in his parents basement, and who has no sense of self worth, living out childish fantasies that most of us outgrew when we were 12.  so, in closing.... *insert image of alien giving a person an analprobe*

The simple reason of why that should not be on DA is this:  IT'S NOT FUCKING ART!  It is some fucking loser with one WAAAAAY over-active imagination trying to be cool in front of people, when he's really making an ass out of himself.  I've done stupid shit before, but I've never actually asked for people to OPENLY FUCKING CRITIQUE IT!

His response to me was simply, ""whatever asshole, eat shit"".  The fact that this person exists is further evidence of my theory that stupid people should be shot, at least once.  Once in the groin, to remove any hope of them ever pro-creating.  And if, after that, they make a stupid comment, that's when you put a lug between the eyes.

If anyone should run across this person on the street, pump some lead into his twig and giggle-berries for me, ok?"

"event","""i am a success doomed to the life of a failure""

that term popped into my head the other day, and i can't seem to get it out.  i understand it, it makes sense to me, and there seems to be nothing that i can do about it, not now at least.

i look at it from several different angles.

#1:  I'm an artist.  a fairly decent artist, i think.  some people enjoy my art.  but it's never going to get me anywhere.  it'll never be my job, it won't earn me millions of dollars.  it's just something i do.  i'm successful at it, but i've failed at turning it into a career.

#2:  I'm a car salesman by trade.  i made a decent amount of money in the 8 short months that i've sold cars.  but now i'm not selling them.  i was successful at selling cars, but failed to keep my job.

Those are the two ways that i wish to relay right now, for the one that i've failed at the most, i've bitched about too many times lately."

i keep asking if anyone's heard of the movie ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", then say that that's gonna be me in 18 years.

hey, it could happen, right?  with girls saying to me, ""if i didn't have a bf, i'd be all over you"" or ""you should come/move out here and i'll take care of that ~.^""

i dunno, these are things that i've heard before.  anyone remember holly?  lord knows i do.  the scar on my right wrist makes sure that i'll never forget her.  and it's twin on the left makes sure i'll never forget the only other girl that i've ever loved (and been with, sorry Amber, you don't count on this one ^.^;;).  so...yeah.....i just felt like ranting tonight.  got sick of ranting to myself at night while i'm trying to fall asleep.  maybe i'll actually get some sleep tonight.  then again, thoughts of the girl that says move, the one that says sorry, and the one that says no just might haunt me again tonight.....

"event","Well, it's been a while, so I might as well update since i've got the chance.

So I've got a part time job now, working at Beverages & More, and it sucks big fat floppy donkey dick.  My last paycheck was a whole $114.  Quite far from the $3200 I last made at Toyota, but it's money for now.

Been drawing alot lately, but I've been slowing down cause I'm running out of pages in my sketchbook, and don't have money to buy another one.

I learned today that one of my oldest friends online is jealous of me.  Turns out that it's about Amber.  Me, Amber, and Zine (that's the only name I know him as)  have been friends online for almost 2 years.  We were members of the H&H and the KKC, and even created the 1337 M4f!4 together.  We were best friends.  Then I went and had to get these feelings for Amber, big mistake on my part, cause nothings going to come of that.  So today I find out that Zine feels the same way about her.  That hit me like a ton of bricks, cause I'm always telling him how much I like her.  I can't begin to believe how he felt all those times.  Actually, I can, cause it's happened to me before.

There was this girl I liked named Jenna.  Everyone knew I liked her.  EVERYONE.  Every time I asked her out, she always said no, that she didn't want a boyfriend.  Then it turns out that she liked my best friend, Kenny.  And he, in turn, liked her.  So that put me in a delicate position.  Wether or not I should make eeyone miserable, or just keep it to myself.  Well, I decided to give them my blessing and spent the next 6 months in my self created hell while they pranced around me, singing songs of how happy they were.  I wanted to die.  It's not the same situation here, because Amber already has a boyfriend.  So it's Zine and myself, and probably others, sitting in our own hells.  Watching.  Waiting.  Hoping.  But knowing that there's little, if any, chance.

But it's made all the worse when I started telling him how I felt.  I didn't know how he felt, and he never made it known.  It ended up being Amber who told me.  I feel bad about this.  Bad about everything I ever told him.  Bad for everything I've ever said.  All around, feeling shitty.

I don't know why he should be jealous.  There really isn't anything between Amber and myself, except the things that go on online.  We simply friends.  That's all.  No matter how much I wish that there was more to it, I'm happy with where we're at right now.

So, Zine.  Don't feel too bad about it.  You and I are in the same boat after all."

"event","CAUTION!  Emo-like venting and bitching ahead!  Read at your own risk!



So there's been one fact that I've had in the back of my brain for a long time, and it's this:  Every single one of my female friends has been with more girls than i have.

This pisses me off.  I can understand all my guy friends, but the fact that girls get more girls than I do just really irks me.  This was first brought to my attention when one of my ex's told me that she was ""experimenting"" for a while.  That hit me hard.  The fact that I dated this girl for 6 months (before I fucked it up) and only got to a little fondling, suddenly went promiscuous on me.  That's when I really started to feel that it had to be something wrong with me.  We dated for so long, went through so much shit together.....and then she just dropped me and started going around.....god, it still hurts thinking about it.  But, yeah.  It carried on when I found out my surrogate little sister told me that she was bi.  That dropped more bombs.  Now my lil'sis got more girls than I did!  And here I was, about 19 at the time, still struggling along.  I couldn't understand what the fuck was wrong with me.  I know that it wasn't......wrong, but it still bothered me.

On and on it went.  Every female friend I made has been with at least 2 or 3 girls.  And here I am now, 21 years old and still carrying my V-Card.  Girls I meet nowadays say I'm cute, and that it's nothing to be ashamed of, but when a certain friend of mine text messages me in the middle of the night proclaiming that he is a ""sex god"", that has a tendency to hurt.  And it's not like he doesn't know that he's doing it, fucking bastard.....

I even fucked up once.  I dated a girl for a while.  She seemed cool and all, but there was one problem.  She kept grabbing other guy's butts.  I know it seems stupid, but this really got to me, and I eventually broke it off with her.  Took almost a year to find out that she wanted to take my virginity, but by the time i found out, she was already engaged.  So chalk that one up to my idiocy.

So here I am.  No hopes looming on the horizon.  No prospects out there even.  All I have is the cold inside me that keep telling me that I'm going to be in this situation for a loooooooooong time."

ice

bringing pain

Some more of my art is posted online.  I did another guest strip for Griff's comic.  It can be read here:  http://home.earthlink.net/%7Eonegai/saris/current.html .  I also did a rendition for Daniel ""San"" Renard.  That can be viewed here:  http://www.micro-blue.net/san/AK_ally_san.jpg .  I also did a pic for my friend Kir, a new pic for Amber with our characters Arke, Rowan, and their daughter Ramea.  I've also got a new pic of Sage aka Cocaine for her as well.  It's one that I'm quite proud of ^_^.  But, yeah.  Other than that, I've been addicted to MVP Baseball 2005 for PS2.  The Oakland A's are 23 - 0 with me playing as them.  So..........um.......yeah, i'm a dork.  Still waiting to hear back from the DMV about my sales license, so in the meantime, I applied at Suncoast, and I might get a job there as a manager, so that would be nice to tide me over in the meantime.  That about wraps it up from my end, although I did write a new poem that i'll probablly post up here today or tomorrow, but file that under ""shit to come""."

"event","well, i'm doing another guest strip for my buddy's web comic.  it'll be posted tomorrow at http://home.earthlink.net/~onegai/saris . It'll be the second Solid Ground strip posted online, so yay.  I've been busy lately, getting the comic done, doing a commission for my friend Kiroki, and another picture for Daniel Renard, http://www.micro-blue.net/san .  I've got another pic that I need to draw for my friend Jessie, then I think that's it, unless Griff needs more web comics.  I'm thinking about charging for pics now, since doing them for free is eating away at my art supplies, and since I only use prismacolors, it's costing me a chunk of change.  I'm still taking commissions.  If anyone wants one, e-mail me @ xvx_trust_xvx@yahoo.com, or message me on Y!M @ xvx_trust_xvx.  Still waiting to hear from the DMV about my sales license.  So I've been watching TV, playing video games, and drawing in my spare time, which is why I'm taking commissions."

why

why must i live my

why must i struggle
endlessly for that certain
feeling that always eludes
me.  everytime i find it
it turns out to be false
a fake, a fraud. it taunts
me from afar.  always out

"event","well, i'm back from my sabbatical in utah, where i had a blast.  friday was crazy, i got in, got my rental car, checked into my hotel and changed.  then i called dave, went and saw him, then watched a movie at his place.  then i called dani.  went to her place and hung out for a couple of hours.  then i moved onto seeing kenny and his fiance, watched a couple of movies there, then went back to my apartment and crashed out.  saturday came along, with promises of seeing the people i wanted to see the most.  it started off with kat in the morning.  we hung out, grabbed some lunch, browsed the toyota dealership there, did some shopping, then i let her go on her way to get ready for the club that night.  then it was off to griff's.  he and justing had gotten back that day, so he and i went and hit up beans & brews until chase got there.  then we hit up rock creek pizza for dinner.  then it was off to justin's until i went to get kat.  we went to the club and waited for the other guys to arrive.  and waited.....and waited.....and waited. when they finally showed up, it turned out kenny had brought one of his fiance's friends, who was under 18, and had to take them back home.  so griff, justin, chase, kat and i made our way into the bar for some beers.  kat had to leave around 12:30, so i walked her to the door.  i didn't want her to leave, but nothing can be done about that now.  the guys and i decided to call it a night.  chase to justin home and griff and i went to hit up belgian waffle.  sunday rolled around.  i went down to church to see everyone there, then it was off to the cafe for brunch.  went down to barnes & noble afterwards to catch up on some manga until griff woke up.  hooked up with him and we went to nicklecade for some ddr.  then it was off to dani's again to pick her up, then off to dinner at freaky dee's.  we dropped dani off back at her place, then it was a quick beer stop until it was off to justin's again for what was supposed to be a drunken halo tournament.  it didn't happen.  griff and russ had to leave to go help one of bree's, griff's girlfriend, friends, who was having trouble with her car.  around 2 am, me, justin, chase, and kenny decided to call it a night.  i called up griff and met him at the walmart that bree works at, then it was off to belgian waffle again.  back to griff's house to burn a quick cd and it was off to bed.  monday rolled around and i was already depressed that i had to leave that day.  called up griff and we went to get bree for some lunch.  then it was off to belgian waffle yet again.  we ate pretty quick because i had to leave for the airport.  one quick flight later, and i was back where i don't belong.  that pretty much wraps it up.  kinda glossed over some details, but oh well.  the thing that sticks in my mind the most is the teasing that kat did to me.  i'm probably thinking too much into it, or maybe i've just got my wires crossed"

I took a moment and looked through the replyies that I've gotten.  from all 2 people that have replied to any of my posts, and I wasn't able to get this phrase out of my mind.  I'm not sure wheter I believe it or not, but it makes sense to me.  Makes me remember times when I was happy.  And I mean TRULY happy.  Last time I can remember was damn near 4 years ago.  I think.  Not sure how long it's been since I messed things up, but I believe it was that long ago.  God, how easy it would've been to stop things then.  If I had done what she wanted, I wouldn't be smoking right now.  But I fucked up.  She told me that she didn't want me to do it for her, but all she had to do was tell me to quit, and I would have.  I gave her many chances, every time she brought it up, to be exact, but she always told me the same thing.  Still holds true to this day, if she told me that's what i had to do.  Not sure if we'd still be together, but I like to think that it might've helped.  My heart still goes back to her.  I've tried, time and again, to pull away from her, but I just can't.  She'll always hold that special place inside me.  First love's have a tendency to do that.  alright.  i'm tired.  i'm going to bed.  maybe more tomorrow, if i wake up........"

Andy groaned as he stirred the sugar and creamer into his coffee as Griff munched his cheese fries.  It had become a new tradition of their's to go to Dee's, a local restaurant, after the club closed.  Andy set his spoon down and took a sip of the battery acid that Dee's passed off as coffee, then shook his head again.

""No man.  Not just any girl.  I'm telling you, she was-""

""The most beautiful girl in the world,"" Griff interrupted as he dipped his cheese fries in ranch dressing.  ""I know dude, you've told me a million times that you saw her.  Well, what're you gonna do about her?  I mean, you said she was gone when you looked back.""

Andy took another sip and shook his head yet again.  ""I don't know what to do.  I didn't get her name, number.  Hell, I didn't even get to talk to her.""  He smirked a bit as he looked at Griff, ""But I do know that I want to see her again.  So, it looks like I'll still be joining you at the club.""

""Griff smiled as he stirred his own coffee and nodded.  ""I'm glad to hear that.  You really need to get out more often, live a little.  Y'know, life isn't all computers, video games, and anime.""

Andy laughed a bit, ""Yeah, I know I know.  That's why I'm gonna keep going, alright?""  He paused and looked at his watch.  ""Well, it's 3 am.  I'd better get home and get some sleep.  Heh, gotta rest up for the club tomorrow.""

""Rest up for what?  All you ever do is sit there and smoke!""  It was Griff's turn to laugh as he and Andy stood up and he grabbed their bill.  He smiled and patted Andy on the back.  ""Anyways, dude, I'm gonna go see Kassie on her break, then hit the hay myself.  Pick you up tomorrow at 8?""

Andy agreed and they took their seperate ways.  That night, with visions of his mystery girl on his mind, Andy fell asleep smiling for the first time in a long time."

Andy sighed heavily as he slumped down in his chair a bit more.  He lit the cigarette that was hanging between his lips as the club's techno music pounded in his ears.  He wasn't big on this scene.  The clubs, dancing, glowsticks.  The only reason he let his buddy, Griff, drag him along was so he could listen to the music.

He had never been popular, even amongst his friends.  He was always a follower instead of a leader, which is why he allowed himself to be dragged along to the club every Friday and Saturday.  He sighed again as he took a drag off his cigarette as his eyes scanned the dark club.

He was beginning to lose himself in his thoughts again when he felt someone watching him.  He turned to find the cource, and nearly dropped his smoke when he did.

Standing across the club from him was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.  She had shoulder length brown hair and was looking at him with the brightest, mos dazzling pair of green eyes he had ever seen.  She shyly smiled as their eyes locked and waved at him as he felt his face go bright red.  He raised his hand, and was about to wave back, when someone suddenly slammed into him.

""What's up dude?""  Griff shouted of Crystal Method's 'Busy Child' as sweat streamed down the sides of his face.  ""Why's your face all red?""

Andy stared at him in disbelief for a moment, then quickly turned back to the girl, only to discover that she was gone.  Enraged, he turned back to Griff and proceeded to punch him repeatedly in the shoulder.

""Ow, ow, OW!"" exclaimed Griff as he pulled away from Andy and began rubbing his now sore shoulder.  ""What the fuck was that for?""

***

What the fuck?  What just happened?  Who are these strange characters?  Will Andy ever see that girl again?  Will Griff's shoulder ever be the same?  To be honest, I'm not sure.  Like I said, it's a work in progess.  More to come, I pormise."

"event","This is an oooooooooooooooooold short story that I wrote when I was obsessed with Mobile Suit Gundam.  Hope you enjoy:


Sleep wasn't easy to come by, so when an opportunity for a quick snooze offered itself, I gratefully obliged.  Even if it was inside my mobile suit, like this time.  My name's Zen.  Zen Deikun.

Holding steady in a low orbit around Luna, I was currently engrosed in a very light sleep in my mobile suit's cockpit.  I hadn't picked up any radar signatures other than the Friend Or Foe ID tags being transmitted by the ships patrolling the area surrounding the Luna IV supply colony.  I dimmed the lights in the cockpit, idled the nuclear-core engine, and diverted power from the vernier rockets on my MS's back to the life support system.  I removed my pilot's helmet and relaxed in the command chair, my eyes slowly sliding closed as i drifted into a gentle nap.  Dreaming, much like sleep, was a rare occurence.  But when the powers of the sandman did reach me, it was always the same.

Megumi Rei.  The girl I had known ever since onto the Juno colony with my father in A.C. 296.  She was my next door neighbor, but in all reality, she was more like a younger sister to me.  Whenever I found my way to dreamland, it was always her face that I saw.

A sudden alarm jolted me from my sleep.  Even in the darkness of the cockpit, I knew where everything was.  I reached out and flipped the lights back on inside the command core and punched up the tactical screens that gave me a 360-degree, panoramic view of the area surrounding my mobile suit.  I re-adjusted the power flow and ignited the MS's nuclear-core engine.  Pulling my helmet back on, I gazed at the tac screens.

After a few seconds of scanning, I spotted it.  A squad of enemy mobile suits at a distance of 7500 kilometers, but closing fast on Luna IV.

""It's about damn time,"" I muttered, and initiated a burn.  With my vernier rockets glowing, I streaked through space on an intercept course with the enemy mobile suits.  The appearance of my mobile suit in flight had earned it the nickname of ""The Dark Comet"", but I had another name for it.

""Ok partner,"" I said to the instrument panel.  ""It's time for these lemmings to witness Tiberian's power.""

Like a bat out of hell, i charged the enemy mobile suits in the GXVX-001, aka, the Gundam Tiberian.

I reached uner my Gundam's buster shield and grabbed a hold of the modified beam saber stored there.  Once the actuator mechanism in the palm of my Gundam's hand touched an identical plate on the beam saber, a bluish particle beam, 10 meters in length, erupted from the hilt.

In a matter of 5 seconds, I closed the distance between myself and the lead SM.  And in another 2 seconds, I was headed for the second MS as the lead one mushroomed in a brilliant explosion.

The entire battle took less than 5 minutes.  In that time, a squad of 12 mobile suits was decimated.  I returned to orbit around Luna and watched as a Core Fighter was launched from Luna IV.  I smiled to myself as I realized the pilot's identity due to the black comet insignia on the underbelly of the Core Fighter.

""No worries, Megumi,"" I said softly.  ""I took care of them all.""  I smiled again and switched off the cabin lights so I could resume my oh-so-rudely interrupted nap.


** Alright, I know it's crap, but I thought it was pretty good at the time.  I'd appreciate any feedback on it, good or bad. **"

I wish I could, but it'll never happen, so I count myself lucky that I was able to see her this one time.  I will see her again, hopefully, next month, but it won't be in the same.....scenario, i suppose you could say.  No matter how hard I wish it will be.  I only hope i get to play with someone while i'm down there, but I doubt i will.  Ah well.  Nothing I can really do about it now, except continue to wish and hope and dream that, one day, i'd be lucky enough to call her mine.  But there's no use crying about it.  Still, it would be nice....."

"event","So there's this new manga that's been hitting the shelves, called Boys:Be.  When I first saw it on the shelf, I thought 'Pfft, just another shoujo manga...', but one day I was particularyly bored at Barnes & Noble (which is very hard to do, since most people don't just hang around B&N unless they're bored) and decided to read it.  Anyways, after reading it, I found myself at the register getting my change from the cashier and walking out with volume 1.  Today, I picked up volume 2 and find myself waiting for volume 3 already.  The premise of the series is interesting.  No real main characters, story line, or plot movement.  It's simply the stories of young men and women as they find love for the first time.  No, it's not THAT kind of love.  The real stuff.  Every story is different characters and different situations.  The great thing about it is that almost every story seems like it could happen.  Makes me wish life was like a manga.  Sometimes, their situations seem to easy, sometimes, it takes either the guy or the girl a little longer to realize what's going on.  So, yeah, sometimes, i wish things went as smoothly as that, because every episode ends in a good way.  But, alas, real life isn't a manga.  Although Real Life IS a web comic, but that's another story."

"event","Goddamnit.  Just when I think I can't get any dumber, I go and prove myself wrong.  Here I am, sitting here online, just minding my own business, when I decide to check out some pics from the club I used to frequent back in good old SLC.  So I'm clicking through them, and who do I see in a couple of them?  The girl that I had an ENORMOUS cruch on.  The same girl that ended up hooking up with one of my good friends at my going away party.  Yeah, my life sucks.  Every time I try to pull myself out of depression, I go and do something like this.  Christmas was a disaster.  New Year's isn't shaping up to be much better.  Y'know, just once, I'd like to have some company of the opposite sex on either of those days.  Then again, some female company would be welcome any day...................*sigh* I just don't know what to do anymore.  All I want to do is go back to Utah.  Nothing seems right out here.  I don't know anybody, I don't do anything.  I miss my friends, my hangouts.......everything.  Kenny, Griff, Dave, Dani....everybody.  I miss going to the club.  I miss meeting new people and having them already know who I am.  If that makes me sound like an egomaniac, then oh well.  I don't care.  I don't care what happens anymore.  Sure, I might have a good job, I might be making good money, but what do I have to show for it?  The only thing I've ever really wanted was that one special someone.  Money never mattered.  Cars, clothes, job, nothing mattered.  All I wanted was her....but I never found her.  To this day, that's all I want.  I could be homeless, penniless, and on the verge of death and starvation, but if I had her, I would still have a smile on my face.  Oh well, nothing I can do about it now.  I have to KNOW girls before I can start dating them."

"event","Well, I'm a genius.  I've been feeling miserable for quite a while now, and what do I decide to do about it?  Look at my ex's on line profile.  Granted, we haven't been together for over 3 years now, but she was the first girl I ever really loved.  So me, being me, decide to look at her profile, and what do I see?  A picture of her with her husband.  Talk about salt in the wound.  Even though I know it isn't her fault, it doesn't change the fact that it hurts.  4 1/2 years of her toying with my emotions, and I still can't bring myself to hate her.  I wan't to, but I know I can't.  No matter how hard I try, I'll never be able to forget her, the scar on my wrist proves that much.  All I had ever wanted, after the last time we broke up, was closure.  She constantly told me ""I don't know"" or ""Not right now"".  For 3 years she played with me, played with my emotions.  I wouldn't hear from her for months at a time, then she would suddenly want to hang out.  Just when I forget about her, just when the pain fades, she brings it back to me.  I spent too much time and effort on her, only to be denied at every turn.  But now, I think I've finally become numb."

"event","Well, the car sales business is looking good.  I'm selling cars and making some good money, and that's all that really matters.  Or is it?  Let me ask something.  You ever have that feeling, that one person that is the last thing on your mind when you fall asleep and the first thing on your mind when you wake up?  Ever had that feeling?  I hate it.  I have it now.  I've had it for a while now.  There's one person that I can't stop thinking about, and there's nothing I can do about it.  I'm not sure that even if there was, I would.  It's a complex situation that involves alot of thinking, and thinking makes my head hurt, so I try not to do it that often.  Still, I wish something would happen, because right now, things are looking up.....looking down."

"event","Well, today is Easter.  Whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo.  Another boring day for me.  Went over to my Grandma's house and saw her, and my Aunt, her husband, and my two cousins.  Could have done without my Aunt and her family, but there's nothing I could have done about it.  Now, I'm sitting here, talking to one of my online firends about how I wish the girls that I talk to online were closer to my age, and that the ones that are lived closer to me.  But it doesn't work that way for me.  Like Holly......I don't want that ever again.  Which is why I'm wary of online relationships now.  Not just because of that, but also because of my friend Chase and his experience with Nat, but that's another story.  I just keep hoping that the one girl would come along that likes me for who I am.  I suppose that's what everyone wants though.  Then there was that whole Angie fiasco.  Ever since I had met her, I had a crush on her, but because of Jon, I couldn't do anything.  Because of that one rule, that she doesn't date customers, I couldn't do anything.  Then, all of a sudden, she has a boyfriend.  One of her regular customers, I might add.  Then they break up, right before I have to move.  Then, the night before I left, she could be seen kissing my buddy Neff at my going away bash.  That hurt.  The worst thing about it is that she didn't even know I liked her.  No, the worst thing was when Neff came to me and apologized because he didn't know.  That was hard.  But now, here I am, wishing that one of these days I meet a girl that I can connect with, at least for a little while."

"event","So I've been working pretty damn often as of late and as tomorrow (or rather today technically) brings my only day off this week after many nights of busting headwait out, I realize that this lots-o'-work thing isn't bothering me so much recently. This makes me happy. In fact, a great abundance of things have been rolling off me like water drops and I'm content to leave them behind.

For instance, Meme will be making the move on Saturday and I therefore need to have all of my things packed up and stationed out of the way before she gets there. So I spent a couple hours here and there sorting through my lifelong collection of belongings (because I am quite the notorious pack rat). Tomorrow, I plan on completing the task. But I digress. My point is that even as I stumbled across a myriad of mementos that before would have meant a stab of pain, this time ... well, this time, it was as easy as setting aside an old pair of underwear. Kind of comfy, kind of ugly now, but you know ... you had your moments with them. You just have to face the facts: they're aren't of any use to you anymore.

Like my analogy? I did.

Anyhow.

I kept a couple things for posterity, like the Lilo & Stitch coloring book from Brian with the crumpled and satirical ""I Love You"" coloring job he did on one of the pages. I found a copy of Page 573 folded and placed in between pages as well, which made me smile in an, ""Oh yeah"" sort of way. I set aside the pictures that Sammy gave me, framed from my sophomore prom when I was with Jack. Things like that. These will be put aside so as not to lose that past entirely. However, they won't be very prevalent in my life anymore.

They aren't my life anymore.

In fact, nothing much remains of high-school at all ... and I'm fine with this, if only because I've done my mourning (and god knows I've done my mourning). Now it's time to move on.

Josh is moving on. Jessi, Krissy, Taylor, Rebecca, Jacqueline, et cetera. These are the people I want to be with now. These are the people that want to be with me now. There is such a difference between them and a world such as Pine View that dominated me so easily.

I have never been so immediately comfortable with someone as I am with Josh. I have never been so sure of my security with someone as I am with Josh. I have never been so readily able to toss all doubts to the wind as I am with Josh.

It's been over two months and we haven't even told each other that we love one another yet. Now this may seem contradictory to what I'm saying but ... it isn't. In fact, it only strengthens my confidence. He doesn't have to say anything. I just ... <i>know</i> these things.

Oh, hush, Lyndsay.

I have no more motivation to write. What I want now is to change into warm, snuggly pajamas and crawl in bed with Josh. He <b>has</b> to keep me warm. It's pretty much due to me since he keeps his room like the damned icebox.

Heh. I wouldn't have it any other way though."

Not one of the best nights I've ever had but definitely not the worst. I guess I can't be too disappointed. What else should I expect for being paid as much as I am at the tender age of nineteen?

Things improved today remarkably as Josh and I spent the entire day out and about the town, having lunch together and spending the majority of our time shopping with holiday gift certificates, et cetera. We've still got Best Buy shopping to do on top of that. And he's currently finishing up a gourmet dinner that he has spent about five hours in the kitchen preparing. ... It should be scrumptious indeed.

I've spent a good portion of this night browsing the computer components I want and purchasing those that I feel comfortable enough with while sipping on well poured Parrot Bay and Sprites. I'm six drinks down with plenty to go before dinner is even finished. Huzzah. Anyhow, computer! My case, cathode light and motherboard should be on their way very soon. I've simply to consult Kevin on my final decision for a processor and then we'll continue with the entire process. It will be beautiful ... with a beautiful bloo light.

"event","First of all: if anyone received a phone call from me within the past 72 hours, it was not me. In fact, my service has been temporarily canceled due to the fact that Hollywood 20 decided to just randomly hand my phone out to a ""young, Hispanic male"" without any proof that he was the real owner <i>after</i> I called and spoke with them twice, including the manager on duty, informing them when I would be there to pick it up (and it was not to be on the same day).

Ha! So after the dumb fuck was stupid enough to call the house twice (drawing Josh's wrath), a 'harassing phone call' report was made and consequently a case number issued involving the theft of my phone. Thank you, Officer Worthington. 

The Sheriffs' office should have obtained the video tape of the phone being given to this ""young, Hispanic male"" who has come to be known as 'Michael' to us (because that's how he answered my phone) and all I can hope to do at this point is perhaps coerce Hollywood 20 into paying for a new phone, since they are quite liable at this point. Especially since, if worse comes to worse, I will be forced to pay all fees for 'breaking contract' with T-Mobile if I have not received my phone back or bought a new phone to replace it by January 28th.

So no cell phone for a while, bloody immature bastard.

Josh and Jessi left about a half an hour ago to go do their Christmas at their father's house. I'm wide awake because a spastic kitten decided to rile up Aden, resulting in Aden chomping on her head for awhile. It's kind of hard to sleep through the yowls and whines of hyperactive animals when they're in the same room as you. Nevertheless, I feel quite fine and I think it's actually somewhat attributable to my new Zen alarm clock, which is muy wonderfulo. I suggest it to everyone if you have excessive sums of money laying about ... and who doesn't?

So! I think I shall go shower myself, get dressed and piddle about town for a while until it's time for work. Fun, non? Yes."

However, he called while I was in the midst of running an hour wait on board and asked if I wouldn't mind mayhaps having dinner with him when I was through. Of course, I was all for this. However, I didn't know when I would be cut. So around 8:30 PM, he started the walk to Outback from the house. Come 9:00 PM, when I was finally cut at work, I talked to Jessi for a little while before going outside around 9:15 PM to wait for him. It was odd that it should take him some 45 minutes to walk from the house to Outback but I figured he had just taken some extra time before leaving or mayhaps he was just being leisurely. Within a couple of minutes, I saw him approaching from a distance with what I assumed to be a book in his hands. Yet the closer he got, the more oddly shaped the book seemed to be ... until I realized as he waved at me that it was a rose wrapped up.

... Swoon.

We ate dinner together until I had to go back on board to close the restaurant. All part of sending Brin home. Ha. Then when I was done for a second time, I found him in Wal-Mart where he was purchasing his present for Jessi.

He missed me a lot. He voiced as much repeatedly. I missed him a whole lot too. ... Sigh. It's almost ridiculously delightful to have him back.

We chatted for some time until Taylor and Krissy came home, at which point the conversation digressed into his good-byes and my teasing, violent, ""FINE, BYE!""s in return ... until he said the most sincere and yet off-handed 'I miss you' I have ever heard and I couldn't help but utter a cliche, ""Aw, I miss you too!"" before hanging up.

I had a nightmare last night involving a lady ghost, her death, Josh's death and the final test of my affections involving his ghost, a pair of scissors, stabbing Josh in the back with them ... and I couldn't do it. Even with the menacing threat of a supernatural death hovering behind me, even with the knowledge that this was not truly Josh before me but only his apparition, I couldn't do it.

I woke up crying.

Josh is the one to make me smile right now! Every morning that I wake up with cramps and a backache, Josh is the one to sit at the foot of his bed, tapping away at his keyboard with his big, goofy headphones on (so as not to wake me). Then he looks at me, grins and says, ""Good morning!"" and I grunt a reply and roll over. He's the one to plant a kiss on me. He's the one to tickle my feet and piss me off because I'm grumpy anyhow ... and then I burrow under the covers and smile.

He won't let me get out of the car if it's cold outside. He inflated my tires for me, leaving me bundled up in my car with the heater on and a blanket wrapped around me.

If I mention I'm hungry, he'll immediately ask me what I want and prepare it for me.

If I'm moody, he'll do everything in his power to cheer me up ... and it usually works.

And even if I'm having the worst night at work, just seeing him in that kitchen makes me beam a smile.

He's ... so immeasurably wonderful that I almost feel as though I'm going to explode trying to put him in definable terms.

... If only he wouldn't keep his bedroom so damned cold though!

I bought him the Happy Tree Friends DVDs. He was giddy ... to watch cute animals slaughter each other in various ways over and over and over ... Mm, graphic carnage fun.

Secret Santa when Jessi and Josh and Taylor are back from Tally. I've already bought my Secret Santa present however I also want to get something for Jessi. I'll have to leave it anonymously on her bed though since the whole point of this Secret Santa deal was to avoid the guilt of not being able to purchase presents for everyone in the house. HA! Take that, Jessi! PRESENT FOR YOU. ... Since I already bought one for Krissy and Josh anyhow ...

The Christmas party was last night at Tulie's. Oh, it was a blast. Lots of karaoke, mingling, and scratch-off tickets. Jessi and I sang The Sign by Ace of Base (hell yeah) and Doug, Chris and I rocked-the-fuck out of Lump. Granted, that was after two shots of tequila, a vodka and cranberry and my mostest favoritest: Parrot Bay and Sprite. But, yes, we still rocked-the-fuck out of it. Doug won the scratch-off tree and so I helped him with a shitload of Bingo tickets. To show his gratitude, he let me keep a three-dollah winnah. Uh huh, uh huh.

See, now I'm just babbling. I want to see Josh again before he leaves but they left a while ago to say good-bye to their father before getting on the road with the promise that they'd be back soon ... and they are not back yet ... and I have to start getting ready for work soon! Sigh!

Oh well. I'll find a way.

Waterballoons, sheet, net, over the net, splash, fun.

Mm, Josh threw Jessi and I in the pool and then snatched away all semblance of victory we could have managed by then jumping in the pool himself, thereby stealing our chance to push him. It was cold. He dumped a bucket of ice water on me immediately thereafter. It was colder.

While on the phone with Meme to wish her a happy birthday as well, Josh ushered me inside where a quaint little birthday cake was waiting. Josh's immediate and in-law family members then serenaded me with a beautiful and totally impersonal version of Happy Birthday. It was touching. When goaded about who had the idea to purchase me a little birthday cake, Josh confessed that it was Tom. ... It made me cry, I was so appreciative.

Mm, Josh, Jessi and I saw Love Actually. ... That too made me cry.

I received a birthday card from Jessi and a birthday card from the dynamic duo of Krissy and Taylor. Upon arriving home from the movie theater, there were suddenly presents propped up on one of the bar stools beneath my newly restrung birthday banner. Taylor bought me a Care Bear Prayer Bear (or something of the sort). He made a point of mentioning that it was funny due to my religious tendencies. Silly boy. Jessi and Krissy gave me a box wrapped in PINK wrapping paper (curse them) and then two layers of packing tape which took me nearly twenty minutes to finally strip off only to discover a piece of paper within the box which said they were taking me on a $100 shopping spree (which will be this Thursday on our day off).

... Le sigh. I cried again. A lot more. ... Part of that was in the poorly lit hallway to Josh's room where the others couldn't see me as I quietly whispered how blessed I was to have all of them and Josh simply held me.

... Le sigh.

I was supposed to be taking a three day vacation to Tallahasse on the 5th, 6th, and 7th (Friday thru Sunday), however Tom has issued a <i>mandatory</i> meeting that neither Jessi nor I can get out of. So now I have to call Bob and inform him that my visit is going to have to wait <i>another</i> month until Josh's drill weekend in January. Hopefully, this will not be an inconvenience. Oh, but let me just tell you: I was royally pissed when I discovered that Jessi and I couldn't go up to Tallahassee. We had requested the weekend off and everything.

... Le sigh!

Nevertheless, Thursday will be said shopping spree with Jessi and Krissy. Then Jessi and I will escort Josh to Tampa where JR will then take him off our hands and up to Tallahasee. Jessi and I will then treat ourselves to a showing of Gothika, which I wanted to see on my birthday but which Josh did not want to see. Huzzah.

Ooh, and Josh M. and Carmen bought me some purty lingerie (which I paraded around the house over my clothes, declaring, ""JOSH! THEY BOUGHT US <i>BOTH</I> A BIRTHDAY PRESENT!"") as a joke and then this very cool game called Scene It? which is simply a blast. ... Oh, and a can of silly string to the face but that was sort of a one-time thing. ... Bastards. ::grins::

My mommy bought me this gorgeous leather jacket (that I discovered ran her a couple hundred).

I am happy.

I invited everyone to Livingston's on Friday. Josh and I played pool for a while, then Taylor showed, then Jessi and Krissy. I had all food and drinks put on the table tab (with devious intentions of paying it all myself at the end of the night as a treat for us all). So some six shots, five mixed drinks, and innumerable beers later, by the time there were closing at 2:00 AM, we had run up at $113.00 and some odd change tab. I scurried up to the counter and managed to pay it off before anyone noticed. I was elated to be able to treat everyone. <i>Elated</i> that we were all out together for one night. ... Also elated that the cocktail waitress decided not to card any of us.

... But I've noticed that this is the benefit to being with a group of people who are 24, 24, 24, and 21. ... I sure as hell don't think I look 21 but ... whatever! If <i>you</i> think I do...

Which was made even more amusing by the fact that they had my ID up at the counter. Haha. Oh, good times. Good Parrot Bay and Sprite times later ...

Let's see. What else?

Oh yes. There is talk of Taylor and Krissy moving out and having their own place by February 1st. As such, there has been discussion as to who would be taking their place in the house. The immediate thought is me, of course, but then questions arise about whether or not this would be a good idea since Josh and I are now dating. Well, I discussed this with Josh today over dinner and despite a couple taboo apprehensions, we're both confident that it would be feasible since we'd have separate rooms. Any and all problems we discussed were easily surmountable in the scheme of things. ... So within a couple months, I might be relocated into my happy commune. Huzzah times TWO.

But enough for now. I want to go curl up with Josh and fall asleep. I've had a long, drawn out day off and now it is time to slumber."

Josh nixed breakfast Thanksgiving morning for a couple of reasons, all of which were in my own interest. (A) I hadn't gone to sleep until 6:00 AM and he wanted to let me sleep in. (B) We would be eating at 1:00 PM anyhow and he wanted me to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner without being stuffed already. That was all well and good and I know he'd be willing to cook breakfast for me nearly any time I should ask (bless his heart), so I took it in stride.

I woke up sometime around 11:30 AM with the impression that we had to be over at Tom's house ASAP (which we did). Nevertheless, we were fashionably late but still on time for dinner to be served at 1:00 PM. There was a buffet set up in the dining room with the sliders leading to the patio open. A long white table was set up next to the pool with fall-themed table centers and all the table fixin's. It was very lovely.

After dinner, people relaxed for a while, milling about here and there. I helped Josh fill up the waterballoons for the muchly anticipated waterballoon volleyball and then the fun could begin. ... Waterballoon volleyball is a BLAST. The net was set up as usual but instead of a volleyball, there are two teams of four equipped with a sheet. Everyone grabs a corner, slides the intimidatingly large waterballoon onto the center and then heaves it over the net .......

November 26th of 2001:

"" . . .

For now, we'll just concentrate on me and ignore those other factors that can get under my skin. For now, we take a deep breath (though we're not all that flustered) and realize that tomorrow is my seventeenth birthday, another step toward what is considered lawful womanhood - as if that really means much at all. Seventeen years old and thatmuch closer to graduation and a new life, a new life that Jack can't seem to get a grasp on yet...

He's still dwelling on the ruins of his friendships from high school and, quite honestly, I both pity and detest him for it at the same time. I couldn't, of course, truly despise him in real sense but I get so agitated when he starts on a spiel about how all of his friends have stabbed him in the back. He seems to think that he's the only to have ever been subjected to such a situation. And, oh, I love him to death, but he drives me to tears every time when I try and convince him otherwise or when I try and justify anything to make him feel the least bit better. It's like kicking a damned dead horse! So what am I supposed to do? Nod and say, ""You're right, Jack. Everyone hates/hated you,""? NO!""

We were on our way to his mothers Sunday afternoon, to have a little social time with her so he could get caught up since he hadn't seen her in a while. While driving, he began on that tangent again and when I tried to counter his arguments, we somehow wound up on the topic of changing one's self. I believe it had something to do with how he had been getting better (because when asked by me what I had ever changed about him, he stated that I helped him appreciate his friends more) but had been relapsing into that angry, bitter state of thinking recently. He was adamant that it was too hard to changes one's self and I responded by saying that I knew just as well as he did how hard it was. In fact, he was the one that encouraged me to changes the things about me that I didn't like: the mind games, the neverending cycle of depression, the too-thick walls built against people...

So here we are in the car, ""arguing"" over this when he says something to the effect of it being impossible for someone to change themselves after all. And, oh my, the tears that he triggered with that statement - because he had been the one to give me the courage to attempt such a feat and he had been the one that held me everytime I broke down and urged me to keep going and now he was the one telling me that it would never actually work and I was the one left with hollow words from the man I love.

It's understandable that I was so upset, correct? Well, before we could get to his mother's house, he pulled into a small dirt parking lot next to a park of some sort in order to right things. He convinced me that what he had said just a few minutes ago was nothing more than words said out of anger, bitterness, simple strength of emotion. Yes, convinced me. Convinced me easily because I can't bear to think that everything I've been striving for within myself was founded upon those devastatingly hollow words from the man I love. They can't be hollow or else I'm left to believe that I'm forever the manipulative, emotionless, walled-off girl that I have been in the past. I know that can't be the case because Jack broke through those walls and I broke through his - so it has to be possible for people to change, right?

...Right...

Enough of this. Too many good things on the way to get weighed down by heavy emotions. ...Good things...

- Lyndsay""

... I remember that incident <i>so</i> clearly too. I had been entertaining myself with a color-by-number picture in the Monsters Inc. coloring book he had bought me.

You want to know something funny? At some point in the deterioration of my relationship with Jack, he cited my 'immaturity' as a flaw that drove him away, including specifically my penchant for such activities as coloring. ... Now why, pray tell, if this was such a bother to him did he seem so delighted to buy me coloring books? ... Huh. Hehe.

Let's see. What else? Post-birthday perhaps?

But that's mostly my mother's fault. So maybe she's the one intent upon destroying me. She certainly doesn't listen when I try and push her for another appointment with the psychiatrist.

I'm sorry, this isn't going to be organized in any sense of the word. This will actually be quite the opposite. I'm angry. I'm venting. I'm annoyed. I'm so damn alone because I can't even turn to Jack anymore.

I tried. I came home from school, I called him. I vented... He... couldn't cheer me up. Well, didn't seem to me like he made much of an effort in the first place. He tells me now that it's because it gets harder and harder every time. Even if he made an effort, however, I would still feel better than when I hang up with him after that - because then I just feel worse, 'cause (guess what) I feel like I'm losing my boyfriend.

I quote:
""how should i feel though... every day, something horrible happens to you, do you know how much energy it takes to cheer someone up... it is really hard... and every day I go through the same things... i know it's hard, but I can only help so much""

With my luck, he'll read this and get upset with me for posting what he said. At this point, I don't care anymore. I'm angry with everyone. Everyone! Well, maybe not Sam... or Jay... or the people who truly make a sit-down effort to cheer me up when they know I'm upset. People who still try. Thank you to them.

But yes, I am royally pissed off (and wounded, but we'll ignore that for now because the anger carries more fuel with it) at the fact that Jack can't even muster the energy to make an effort toward me anymore.

""it just seems like i am not doing anything since every time you revert to being unhappy again... i don't know how to make you feel better, i want to so badly... i just wish i could wipe away your troubles""

So he doesn't even try anymore. I get silence on the phone instead. I hang up with him feeling worse than I did when I first called. That's not good.

Bad thoughts have started to creep inside my mind. Like 'break up' thoughts, though I would never propose the idea. I know he wouldn't right now either... but maybe he's having the same thoughts. [Please make note that we broke up very, <i>very</i> shortly hereafter. Say, within a week or so?] And the only way I would find out was to bring it up, but I don't want to put him into a panic. I just want to know where we stand right now because if breaking up is a remote possibility in my mind, then something is not right.

He's just so far away (and NO! I don't mean the distance!)...

Grrrrrrrrrrr. GRRRRRRRRRRr. GRrrrrrrrrrr...

If I were a man, I'd be slamming my fist into a wall right now.

Since I'm female (and me), I'm going to growl instead. Right. Way to go, Lyndsay.

. . .

What the hell am I doing wrong?

I love Jack. But why does it feel like I'm losing him steadily? I would ignore everything else - my mother, school, everything... only if I could repair things with Jack. Funny how he's still my number one priority.

. . .""

Attached to this entry were the notes:

'Note to self: Remind Jack that you damned well do know how much energy it takes to cheer someone up since he's not exactly Mr. Sunshine all the time either. Perhaps he forgot that. It would be best to refresh his memory.

LET US CONTINUE TO 2002!!!!!

November 27th of 2002:

""8:00 AM on this Wednesday morning, my birthday, and I am crying. I have no reason to be crying really. I mean, on one hand, the realization that I'm going to be spending half of my birthday alone in this house is kind of depressing but ... it's not all that unlike any other day, right? Brian and Josh have left to take Robin to work and then continue on their way to help Brian's father close down the shop, a half day of work. Brian should have been leaving for Ohio today but that fell through last night - the trip he was looking forward to so much has now been cancelled. He said the other day that he almost wouldn't mind simply because he had been planning on taking a roadtrip up to Ohio when he had the money anyhow but he also said last night that all twenty-something of his cousins would be there which is a rare occurance and he would have liked to see them. I don't blame him - when you have an actual family, it's nice to spend time with them if given the opportunity.

In the meantime, now he won't have the anxiety over my allegiance to him while he's out of town. He's not going anywhere and neither am I. My home is still within him. And I get my boyfriend for part of my birthday. I think I'll get to see Megan, Brinson, Paul and Shane tonight too to see Harry Potter. To see Brinson and Paul will be a nice treat. A very nice treat.

So what is this nauseating depression that hangs over me? As I said before, I have no reason to feel this way. To be totally honest, it seems things are looking up on every front imaginable for the time being... I mean, I've found some place to live. The car will be signed over to me shortly. Brian is back to his old self to some degree. My job is pretty much as enjoyable as it has always been (if one ignores the incapacitating cramps I've been suffering the past two days).

Brian and Robin made me cry the other day with their birthday presents to me. They brought out a pumpkin pie with an 18 candle in it. I don't think I could even begin to express how much that meant to me. Brian wrote me a love-letter (::drool::), gave me two coloring books and a new box of crayons and a bottle of the perfume I've borrowed from my mother too many times to count. He was proud that he took notice when I perused the aisles for it at Wal-Mart one time. I was too. Robin bought me some beautiful clothes that Brian helped her select and an absolutely beautiful locket that matched. The ring Brian gave me the other day as an early birthday present (simply because I ... had been persistently begging him in a way and he was impatient to give me something) is just as beautiful - it's the perfect style of ring too. He knows me well. Ironically, however, it only fits on my left hand, on the ring finger. ""So does this mean we're engaged, Brian?!"" "" ... What?!"" Hehe! I love that boy. I love these people as ... family. I am so grateful to them for everything they have done to me. I wish I could show it somehow...

Where am I going to be living? Well, my mother caught me off-guard the other day (though I did expect something of this sort to come around eventually) when she offered to narrow our relationship down to a strictly tenant/landlord exchange as far as the house was concerned. I pay $75 a month, including utilities (which is ... absurdly wonderful) and have full access to the house just as if I live there normally. She said I was free to come and go as I please, et cetera. The only thing that is absolutely required of me is that I clean my room and the garage A.S.A.P., which I think is more than reasonable. I've got dirty clothes strewn all over that wing of the house to the point where the floor is totally obscured. Nevermind the dirty glasses and dishes laying around. She's right - no landlord would let me live like that in their house. Besides, I've been looking for an excuse to totally empty my room out and give it a thorough cleaning. When we first moved in, I barely unpacked. I hung some things on the wall and found those few objects I marked as necessities. Everything else in my room as of current has been accumulated since that year ago. Anyhow, I've never gotten around to fully unpacking because I always figured I'd be leaving soon, which would mean packing it all up again. Besides, I was rarely ever home. I imagine I'll be spending a bit more time at the house now seeing as how this has resolved some of the issues between my mother and I and there will be less tension. I'm apprehensive about how long this tenuous peace will last but I figure that this tenant/landlord relationship will at least buy me some time to save money if nothing else. It's just an enormous burden lifted from my shoulders.

She's also researching with the insurance company if I can remain on her insurance policy with the car when I'm 18 without her being responsible should an accident occur. She doesn't want a lien put on the house if I screw up but she also doesn't want me to have to pay the whopper of a first insurance payment for my own policy. So if I can remain on hers without becoming a threat to her property, she'll let me stay for a while. I think until I'm 21 is how it works. I don't know.

There are so many things I want to do now that I'm 18. Ironically, this age means nothing more to me than the fact that I can now complete legal transactions and sign contracts on my own, without an ""adult"". So I want a membership to the local movie store and I want a cell phone if that's financially feasible any time in the future and I want a credit card so that I can charge one little thing a month and build up some credit, et cetera. HOWEVER, unfortunately for me, I can not complete the first without having completed the last because I found out last night, much to my dismay, that a membership to any movie store requires a credit card which is very alarming. Not everyone has a credit card, ok? That's not very fair to those ordinary, good folk who just want to rent a movie, you know? I just want to rent some movies! I don't think a $3.95 movie is worth having a collection agency sent after me if I have late fees. It would just be genuinely idiotic to steal a movie from the movie store and suffer the consequences that would ensue rather than pay the late fees and get it over with. I know people still try but ... idiots.

It's too bad I'm not tired in the least. I snuggled up with Brian at 12:30 AM and went to sleep when he did. Yet I woke up at 3:30 AM (which was alright simply because I could handle consciousness for another three minutes to mentally celebrate my birthday for a split-second - yay, 3:33 AM), 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM. ... Again at 7:40 AM because that is when Robin woke Brian and Josh up. I can safely assume I'm going to try and sleep sometime in the interim between now and when Brian returns from his quasi-work day, simply because I've always said that sleep passes time by a lot faster than consciousness does.

Unfortunately, I have to worry about the fact that I told Taylor and Josh I would take care of the pets today and part of that responsibility is taking Aden out in the late morning/early afternoon hours. That's not going to happen since Brian has his car and I'm stuck here. I won't be able to take Aden out until around 3:00 PM. I feel bad though so I'll most likely compensate by letting him run around out in the front yard for a while - let him have his doggy fun. I have to stop by again in the evening/early nighttime hours to give Aden-puppy a scoop of food and to fill Cassie's bowl. I adore those animals. They're both so sweet even if Cassie is only docile because she's absolutely petrified of anything that moves, including her own back feet. ... Heh. It's true.

So I'm probably going to resort to playing Diablo for a while... or attempt that sleep thing just to get it out of the way. I don't know right now. We'll see.

... Happy birthday to me ...

[[ Lyndsay ""

Oh, oh, yes. Yes, I am so <i>cheerful</i>, aren't I?

Well, that's one good thing about revisiting the past: it shows the progress one has made with all the more vividness. Yay, me.

Time to go cuddle up to a sleeping Josh, a sleeping Josh who's birthday present to me was to pay my application fee for MCC and he could not have gotten me anything better. ... A sleeping Josh who is going to be waking me up in three hours in order to serve me the breakfast that he cooked. ... Boy, oh, boy. Please take note of the grin plastered to my face.

... That was fun now, wasn't it? Come again soon for more good 'ole stories from the Bin of Lyndsay's Past Despair, WOE!"

Carmen's here at the house. Josh M. will be gone for about fifteen days so while Taylor and Krissy are back up in Tally, she'll set up camp in Taylor's room. Josh is at school. Today is one of this eleven or so hour spans. Le sigh. I haven't had a chance to see him let alone speak to him all day. So I'm waiting and waiting and waiting...

There was a charity event off University Parkway yesterday. It was a Venice Outback event at first until we made the connection that it would be far more logical for the University store to staff the event than for us to send our people all the way up there since they would be seeing the benefits of increased business <i>anyhow</i>. They had a hard time gathering an appropriate amount of servers and kitchen guys so we managed to scrape together three servers and ... pretty much the entire kitchen staff. Well, lo and behold, I was scheduled to close yesterday when Krissy idly mentioned that Tom had called and explained to her that the University kids were going to leave the event early to get to <i>work</i> and they would therefore have three servers to cater to a group of 200 people. ... ... ... I begged her to divide up my section and let me go up there. Josh was working the event. She wouldn't consent at first. Nevertheless, I was persistent and persuasive and she made a call to Tom and sent me on my way.

Oh, it was such a breeze.

We were done by 8:30 PM or so. Tom, Bill, Cheyanne, Lilly, Josh M., Josh and I went out to Don Pablo's up on Fruitville afterward. Lots of margaritas, appetizers and conversation. It was such a blast. ... Except for when Josh slapped me in the eye with a tortilla. ... Yeah, that kind of sucked. ::shakes a fist menacingly::

Anyhow.

By the time we were all ready to head our separate ways, it was only 10:00 PM. Josh and I watched three of his Western Civ. videos (much to my delight), had another batch of margaritas and then wandered to his room where I finished up a couple papers for Krissy and Outback and then cuddled with him briefly before headin' home.

... Yeeeeeeah, life is good.

Puppy and kitty action is also good. ... Except when kitty is SATAN and uses my back as something to CLIMB for <i>painful recreation</i>.

A fairly productive day already for the hour and a half that I've been awake. I succeeded in getting some cleaning done before Susie's at the house later this afternoon. She'll be finishing up whatever's left and doing the nitty gritty tasks that my mother and I are both too lazy to complete.

Speaking of my mother, she's out of town yet again. I've not a clue the duration of this trip but that's fine by me. As much as I love having my mother around, I also love having the house to myself. ... Especially with the fantastico system we have.

Mm, loud music and big floors to dance around.

I'm just waiting for Krissy to e-mail me a couple things from the Outback office so I can finish them up and get them to the restaurant. Tom's doing payroll right now so she doesn't have access to the computer but I am a patient creature.

I'm patient enough to wait until 4:00 PM or shortly thereafter when Josh should be home. ... ::giggle:: ... 

Ooh, and there's a ""family"" meeting tonight, called by Taylor. ""To put everyone on the same page,"" he said in explanation. I'm not entirely sure what this meeting will deal with but it will probably be for the best. Good luck to the five of us. The dynamics of the house are a bit askew now that Taylor and Krissy are paired, Josh and I are paired and Jessi is experiencing her recent depression. But communication is good and I'm not the least bit concerned by this little gathering. With these people, I understand that they're mature enough to handle these situations with minimal melodrama and more productive patterns of behavior.

... I love them.

Well, on that note, I'm going to check my e-mail now, venture into the living room to harass Taylor while he plays on the X-Box and then perhaps indulge myself in some backgammon.

Let's start from the beginning.

Monday night, I was headwait. Josh came into the restaurant to give someone their car back. I think he had Taylor's. Nevertheless, he stuck around until I was finished (seeing as how I would be taking him home). While Krissy and I had to-go cups of Wallaby Darned to sip on, Taylor and Josh sat up at the bar and helped themselves to the tap. So in the span of time it took me to do the cash drops, run the 200s, Communications, and enter the night's labor costs, Josh apparently downed two and a half beers.

... God bless the little light-weight. He's so cute.

We snuggled up in bed upon arriving home in order to watch a couple episodes of Sealab 2021. He was a mite frisky and then excessively apologetic when it wasn't entirely reciprocated. ... Of course, we were then up until 3:00 AM horsing around in bed, laughing, discussing the most absurd things. I had told him earlier in the night that I would be going home at some point so that I could wake up fairly early on Tuesday and get some cleaning done for my mother. ... By 3:00 AM, I was content to curl up against his side and drift to sleep (with the understanding that if he should wake me up at any point, I would be going home - teehee).

At 11:30 AM on Monday, we were awake. After a couple minutes of laying contentedly beside him, we finally managed to roll me out of bed and send me on my way. I accomplished a few things at home, dressed for the day and then came back here, to the house. I took film from Michigan, Halloween and the ball to be developed, picked up some chicken while I was at Wal-Mart and then stopped by Outback to talk to Krissy for a couple minutes and get a book out of Jessi's car that I wanted to return to Barnes & Noble. I checked that the receipt was in the book still and then left for Sarasota.

By the time I was at Barnes & Noble (including twenty minutes of being stuck in traffic on 41), the receipt had MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED. Deciding that I should make the best of my trip anyhow, I found the receipt for a CD I had not yet opened and resolved myself to returning that instead. ... Except the receipt for <i>that</i> BLEW AWAY as I was stepping out of my car. ... So shoot me in the head. Neither Best Buy nor Barnes & Noble would allow me to return my merchandise so fuckthemtoo.

Even <b>better</b> though: while in Barnes & Noble, I had sat down for a second to check my checking account balance. Unfortunately, I left my wallet on a little table when I left. I had realized my mistake by the time I made it to my car so I ran back. My wallet was where I had left it but all of my money was ... GONE. Sigh. I used the last $4.72 in my checking account to fill my empty gas tank and took my defeated derriere back to Venice.

My mother gave me $60.00 out of her savings account to pay for the pictures and to pick up a couple other things from Wal-Mart for Josh's cooking. As if things could not get any better, I paid for the pictures, found myself a shopping cart and parked in the produce section to sort through the film when I discovered that I had DOUBLE EXPOSED the roll of film from the ball, thereby <i>ruining</i> all of the pictures that everyone was counting on me to have (since we couldn't find Jessi's digital camera that night). Yeah! That's just what I needed! Within minutes, I was in the spice aisle, crying over the phone to Josh who kept telling me to 'come home'. So I finished gathering what I needed and <i>did</i>.

Tom was here when I arrived. He had brought Josh his birthday present (a new bike). After a couple minutes of idle conversation and watching Riley and Aden interact, he invited us to dinner with him, which we accepted. ... Let me tell you, it sure is fun having dinner with your boyfriend and best friend's father ... who is also your BOSS. ::twitch:: ... Actually, it was a lot of fun.

I could only drink half of a margarita (because they were ridiculously strong) but Josh and his father finished the pitcher off by themselves. Needless to say, by the time Josh and I made it home, he was el drunko. It was fun-o. He accomplished zero cooking for the rest of the gang but I did have him in bed rather quickly and both of us were asleep by 10:30 PM or so.

He left for school before I was entirely awake this morning. I'll be at work before he's done with school but I'm sure he'll stop into the restaurant ... which might just be slightly awkward. This will be the second night I get to work with Brian since everything went down. In fact, tonight is the night he asked me to return his shirt to him, the one that I borrowed the night everything began to happen between he and I. So I should probably go home in a couple minutes, dig through laundry until I find the shirt, get it washed, dried and ready to go. ... Sigh.

I'm headwait again (yay for at least two shifts a week) and then I suggested Jessi and I go bike-riding tonight. It's been a while and the weather is progressing beautifully toward that fall feeling. Mm... Yes."

"event","I just got back from Tallahassee about an hour ago. I had laid down in Josh's bed to take a little nap before work at 4:00 PM but sleep did not come. Apparently it came enough on the car ride down. After an astounding three and a half hours of sleep, Jessi, Josh and I woke our groggy asses up at 5:00 AM and shuffled to the car to get back to Venice in time for Josh to be at work ... at 11:30 AM. But it was yet another fun-filled Tallahassee jubilee.

Jessi and I worked an event on Thursday night and then left straight for Tallahassee. We were finally out of Tampa around 10:30 PM after nearly an hour of sitting in traffic. It seems there are a couple dumb fucks out there who rubberneck a bit too much at one accident and thereby cause another accident within a couple hundred feet. Ha ha! GOOD JOB, IDIOTS. ... Teehee. We were in bed in Tally by 3:00 AM, including time to piddle around Wal-Mart in some random town and time for Jessi to be pulled over on I-10 for doing a hellacious <i>82</i> mph. ... GASP. IT WAS TOO FAST. ... ... ... Ironically enough, she was pulled over within 200 feet of the exit we wanted too. Hehehe.

Josh, Krissy and Taylor came up the next morning. They were in town sometime around noon. We did a couple things here and there. Josh, Jessi and I went and saw Elf. ... Yep. No comment there. We had to be home for Josh's birthday dinner though. So we ate dinner with the family and he was absolutely giddy to be able to introduce me as his <i>girlfriend</i> ... you know, even though I've met most of them on many occasions already. I am best friends with his sister, after all. Mm, dinner was a lot of fun. The young ones were stuck doing the dishes while the five of us went out and shot pool until midnight.

Heh, Torey took it upon herself to announce to Josh, ""You know, I've always thought your tastes in girlfriends was poo before."" I nearly died. Josh just smiled and said, ""Who says it isn't still?"" He's so much fun. It's about damned time we're together ... damn it.

Mm... Saturday, we gathered to have our hair done (the girls, that is ... but the guys were there) by Laura, Josh and Jessi's cousin. I was apprehensive to have anything done to my hair before the ball but she did such a <i>phenomenal</i> job matching a hairstyle to my dress. There will be pictures eventually. Phenomenal. Josh looked ... so overwhelmingly sexy in his Marine uniform. I never thought I'd go for a guy in uniform but ... oh god. I wanted to jump him. There will be pictures of that too. ... The uniform, that is. Not me jumping him. ... No. Anyhow.

At the Marine Corps Birthday Ball, he was once again giddy to be able to introduce me as ""my Lyndsay"". He was joyous to have pictures taken with me. He even DANCED with me. GASP. Yes, Josh DANCED ... willingly! He doted upon me. Krissy said he was staring at me while the speakers were up. He kept telling me how beautiful I was, how perfect I was, how ... everything. I don't know. It was ... just so fairy tale-ish ... to be walking around in a gorgeous dress with <i>numerous</i> people approaching me and complimenting the way I looked, with Josh escorting me around like the pure gentleman that he is ... and in full uniform at that.

There were after-parties but after some maneuvering around town, Josh and I decided to call it a night ... well, sort of. We returned home and dressed down for a stroll around the neighborhood. It was around 1:30 AM at this point. Jessi was out with some of the marines she knew. Taylor and Krissy had gone home. We were essentially alone for a while. So we walked and everything was perfect as usual with him swinging me up in his arms and carrying me for small stretches or kneeling down to give me piggy back rides for no reason whatsoever. I adore him. I adore him. I adore him.

I am beginning to fall in love again. I have wanted this with him for some time now and it's all falling into place.

Sunday, we went shopping with his family so that he could spend his birthday money on a couple of things he's been wanting for a while. We broke free for a couple minutes and then returned. Jessi was out with Fawn and we were to meet the two of them for a movie later but that didn't pan out quite right. So after meandering around the mall for a while, walking hand in hand and talking of many things, we headed over to Pockets Pool and played pool for two hours. Returned home. Horsed around on the couch and watched Adult Swim before it was time for all of us to go to bed. ... In all actuality, I didn't let him go to sleep until some time past 1:00 AM. I just kept scooting back out to the living room where he was sleeping on the couch and then kneeling beside him to lay my head on his chest. I wanted so badly to be back here in Venice where I could curl up and fall asleep with him.

Le sigh.

... I don't want to go to work. I want to be here when he's home from school. Unfortunately, I'm headwait ... so that won't be happening.

... Ooh, and Halloween was a blast too. I should have pictures of that eventually as well. Hrm. Yeah.

I'm missing things. I don't care. I've prattled way too much.

Like always."

It's nearly 6:00 AM. Jessi and I went to Wal-Mart after work and bought two bikes: one for myself and one for Krissy as a present from Jessi for helping her out today. Jessi had bought herself one two days prior. So now the three of us have semi-matching bikes (only made 'semi' by the fact that Jessi's color scheme is the same as ours but inverted) and we're all very giddy about going on bike rides together. Jessi, Krissy, Josh and I went from the commune to my house and back again. Jessi and I weren't ready to call it quits just yet though so I took on her all the back roads down to Manasota Beach, then up to 776 and back to the commune. I drove it before I went home just to see how long it was. Jessi and I biked eight miles this morning technically. She and I plan on going biking every night now, even if only for fifteen minutes or so. It was just so relaxing and <i>healthy</i> at the same time.

Mm.

I had a rather poor night at work. It would have been much better had the ten top that they were saving two of my tables for not accidentally walked with the wrong credit card slip and therefore gipped me of the entire tip amount. ... So in all actuality, my highest bill for the night (for a good portion of the ten people, mind you) actually <i>cost</i> me money after I had to tip out for it. Poo on that. However, I was absolutely rockin' in the kitchen and in my service otherwise. It was noted by Krissy. I was proud. There are definitely some nights when I actually believe them when they say I'm one of the best servers there. Otherwise, I feel inadequate. Oh well!

I have the day off tomorrow. Hooooray. I think I'll head over to the commune when I wake up and go for another bike ride by myself. (Yes, I am really this giddy over having a bicycle again. It's so much fun!) Then I think I'll try and get some cleaning done around here, maybe do a couple loads of laundry. Jessi and Taylor are both working floor shifts. Blah. Oh well. I can harass Josh for endless hours.

Teehee. Brian dumped a trash can outside accidentally. I was the only one around to witness him cursing at the world and kicking boxes around. I merely laughed, shook my head at him and swept it up. He gave me that special smile and thanked me. I nearly peed myself. It was all very exciting.

I was excited, damn it.

Too bad Taylor's stressing Krissy out so much. Le sigh. All's well that end's well though, right? ... Mm, Vegas in a month. How dramatic.

SLEEP TIME. It's that time of the day where you cuddle your adorable yellow cat and usurp your mother's bed for uber-comfort. ... Well, c'mon now, git goin'."

"event","I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that for the first time in my short life, I genuinely <i>love</i> said life. I mean I really am having a good time of things. I'm content with my job, my social life, my romantic life, my academic life and my future opportunities. All of them are ever evolving and always progressing. This makes me happy. Nothing is stagnant. Nothing is falling behind.

I'm blessed to be eighteen and making as much money as I do, especially when taking into consideration the amount of work I do. It's averaging out to $12.00 an hour or more and we're not even in season yet ... and I'm not including headwait hours which appear on my paycheck. I adore the people I work with (most of them anyhow). My manager is one of my best friends. I'm slowly but surely taking on more resposibility in the workplace and coming to be viewed as a figure of leadership. ... Teehee. Kind of. I just ... love Outback. I do.

I'll be enrolled in MCC by next semester. Money is going to be tight but student loans are definitely feasible. I'll finally be able to get the education that I've been <i>craving</i>. I genuinely miss learning and being in a student-oriented environment will allow me to meet new people, which is never a bad thing.

The friend I have now are unfaltering in their loyalty. I am so inexplicably grateful to have Jessi, Josh, Taylor, Krissy, Rebecca, Jacque and Nathan, et cetera. Too many to name. They're all just so ... good at heart. I was aware of how awesome they are compared to previous friendships but especially knowing the things that I do now (and became aware of in the past week or so), they're just ... I don't know. I'm actually bursting with gratitude every time they're there for me. I'm actually overjoyed when something good happens to them (ie the approaching wedding) and I'm seriously broken-hearted when any of them are hurt. I love them with everything I have. 

I'm not exaggerating when I say they give me faith in the world.

I went out with Brian the other night and had a great time. I was helping him buss a table of mine tonight when he asked when we'd go shoot pool together again. He immediately added that he had Saturday, Sunday and Monday off work. I laughed. I blushed. I told him I'd check my schedule ... and that was the first thing I did when I made it back to the kitchen. I'm cocktailing Friday and he's a mid-shift, so we settled on that night to go out again.

The thing about all of my recent romantic possibilities is that they've all had at least one flaw that has made me think twice. With Tommy, he reminded me of Brian <i>way</i> too much to be comfortable. They were the good qualities of Brian but they were unsettling to me nevertheless. I couldn't bring myself to even see him a second time because of it. With Kevin, I loved to spend time with him, I enjoyed his artistic nature, his playful side, his academic drive, et cetera, but his drug habits were a serious warning sign to me. I become paranoid of drug use in potential boyfriends.

With this Brian, I was worried about his lack of ambition. I used to think I'd never care about such things but as time has progressed, I've come to consider it more and more. With Brian, I love how quiet and withdrawn he is with most people and then the feeling that swells up in me when I make him smile or ... even ... <i>laugh</i>. His smile is fantastic to me. It's like I <b>earned</b> it. It's genuine. It feels reserved for me. I like that I can warm him up to serious conversation, that I can watch him unfolding and opening up to me. I like that he can knock the cue ball off the table eleven times in one night and not be embarassed. I like that he can make a joke of it with me. I like his eyelashes even, damn it. Then there was the perpetual reminder that he doesn't ever want to go to college and, at first, I thought this was a bad thing. But listening to him since then, I realize that he does have aim with his life. There are things he wants to do. There are things he's very passionate about. There are things that fill him with the fire to move forward in life. Just because he doesn't want to get his education doesn't mean he's going to be stupid about things. I enjoy thinking that there might be some potential with him and because I know one thing he hates more than anything is being lead on, I have purposely avoided any potential teasing moments. When we were saying goodnight the other day, I made a point of getting in my car before there was that awkward 'do we kiss?' moment.

I don't know. That doesn't seem very substantial but it is.

I'm babbling like always.

I'm increasingly proud of myself for the amount of responsibility I've been taking from everything from my romantic life to my financial standing. There are bills in my name posted on the cork board across from my bed and I can actually breathe easy when I look at them because I know it's entirely within my ability to pay them off, build up credit and establish good habits for myself. I <i>won't</i> ruin my future like my mother allowed herself to do. I will work for what I need and what I <i>want</i>.

On an unrelated note, Erik ... well, just Erik. Le sigh. He should be coming in January. I was looking up air fares for him tonight since I seem to have a knack for finding good deals. He has his heart set on being here in January and part of me really, really wants him to come down ... but at the same time, part of me is protective of both he and I and I don't want to have to subject us to that pain yet again. The 'Hi, we're still in love but I'm realistic about not being together and therefore I'm going to push you away to an extent and you're going to get angry and attached and it's going to be hell on both of us, ok?' pain. I don't know whether to admire him for holding out on the possibility of us getting back together or to slap him upside the head for not moving on with his life. To tell you the truth, I've been outwardly leaning more toward the verbal slaps upside the head.

Bah. I'm done with this for now. This is far more outpouring than I've done in a while.

I'm going to go play with my new toys now. Meow.

...Up again, down again, out of your head.
When she's beside you, you're really not so dead.
Up again, down again, out of your head.
When she's beside you, you're always at your best..."

"event","So everyone at Outback knows about the wedding now.

We went over to his friend Scott's house for a while then headed up to Livingston's to play pool until they closed. I would have taken him to V.I.P. after that but I was pretty sure they'd card him. So we went back to his house, sat in the garage and talked until 3:00 AM. Then I spent another hour and a half talking to Jessi in her room before we both decided it was time for bed.

Friday night was another night of celebrating at V.I.P.. I just need to get the film in my camera developed to see if the group picture came out. Some drunk guy was trying to take the picture and kept zooming instead of ... well, taking the damned picture.

Mm, Saturday night was interesting. I went over to Brian's and played Halo with the boys for a while. It was actually very entertaining ... because I didn't lose EVERY time. So. That was neat. Yep. ... Then I spent a long time distracting Josh from his paper and harassing him mercilessly.

What am I doing tonight? ... I don't even know anymore. Yikes.

I'm babbling.

OH WELL."

I made plans with Kevin to go play pool when he was done with work. So I was back at Outback at 10:00. We met up with Mike and played pool up at Livingston's until ... like ... 12:30 AM. Hooray for Ladies' Night. I am free. I am most definitely free.

Myers. Meghan's throwing sobriety to the wind as I type this, preparing for the tedium of 'moving day'. I'm sleep-deprived (what else is new?) and about ready for this day to be over already. That's not to say that it's particularly unpleasant or anything. In truth, it's completely blank as of yet. ... Or is it that I'm completely blank as of yet?

Post-nervous breakdown syndrome. Three cheers for having your manager/good friend send you home for the night because you can't stop crying for NO REASON WHATSOEVER. I stumbled through the door at 5:30 PM or so only to have my mother shove a Zanax or two down my throat because I <i>still</i> couldn't stop. ... And then I went back to work at 8:30 PM for headwait! ... Which was a sham since I was training Jessi anyhow and ... well, this being her last night of training, she did it all by herself. I merely kicked back with a little radio/tape player and <u>House of Leaves</u>.

Unfortunately, apparently all higher forms of being <b>hate</b> me.

You see, the radio was too loaded with static to be even close to tolerable and when I finally decided to make the trip to my car to find a tape substitute, what should be the only tape I could find?

""Since it makes you happy...""

While I did entertain the thought of slamming my head in the car door repeatedly, I instead sucked it up, made up some self-disillusionment about 'testing my resolve' or some such nonsense, and marched back into the office with tape in hand.

""I like this music!"" was what Jessi had to say.
""Yeah, well, this is a tape Brian made for me.""
""... Oh.""

So I was curled up in the corner of a dimmed office, hugging my most precious book and whimpering. I felt hideously stupid until Jessi finally said something along the lines of this: sometimes, you just have to listen to music that reminds you of <i>him</i> so that you can just let it out.

Which is true.

I am not a masochist. I am a human.

... All of that aside (and what a tangent that was), it's time to be headin' down to Ft. Myers. I don't want to keep Meghan and the cats waiting for too long.

"event","Tuesday's going to be a go for Tommy and I. When Jessi and I stopped by Outback yesterday in order for me to get some soup to go, Meghan strutted into the kitchen with a grin plastered from ear to ear. I couldn't help myself. In the middle of a group of people who had not a clue what was going on, we both started dying of laughter. ""Alright, you win! Shut up!"" Meghan has succeeded in 'hooking' Tommy and I up as was her plan all along ... or so she says.

I'm afeared of Tuesday. I explained my anxieties to Jessi last night while perched at one of the high-top tables at V.I.P.. I was tired after a long day: a hair appointment at 9:30 AM, some down time and then Jessi and I were out and about at Sarasota Square (where I spent all together too much money again), then downtown at Hollywood 20 for the 7:45 PM showing of <u>Once Upon a Time in Mexico</u> ... which just made me so happy. A couple hours spent here (at the house) with Jacqueline and then we headed over to the V.I.P.. A gaggle of 'frat boys' was present, exciting Jessi to the prospect of having people 'our age' around Venice. Like I said, I was tired and anxious over several different subjects ... so I wasn't much company when two of them, Chad and Rick, decided to come mack on us. In fact, I think I was downright unpleasant. It made me smile on the inside. Chad scoffed, ""Are you wearing black on your nails?"" ... ""Actually, it's <i>blue</i>."" ... So there.

But now I've had another lengthy night of sleep (probably too lengthy) and I'm blessed with a bowl of Kellog's Red Berry ... cereal stuff ... which is just heavenly. My uterus is a raging creation of it's own but I can live with this.

Erik's pissed off at me. Le sigh. So it goes. S'what I get for being honest with people, I guess. He even said he would have rather had me lie to him. What's up with that?

Mm, but I get to headwait for the next three days! I'm going with Josh to MCC on Monday to finally get this done with and then I can look forward to classes come next semester. Yeehaw.

I took up my place upon an air mattress and Jessi took the throne of her bed. Conversation left the comfort of light-heartedness and adopted the heavy air of serious matters, of past love and present agony. As we do, we related stories. One to the other. We matched up experiences.

I told her of the time I missed school (right before I finally missed it for good) and fearing the confrontation to be held with my mother over another truancy, I fled to your house. You and Jesse had been awake for most of the night. I had to knock on your bedroom window to rouse you. We sat on the loveseat by the kitchen. I cried. Dusty was there. I took him for a walk in the rain. I was wearing one of your shirts and one of your ties. I felt better.

Trying to finish such a simplistic story made me quietly sink into those vast, rooted memories. Hey, ow.

I don't know why I'm putting this here when I could feasibly speak this to you privately or by some other means. I think it has something to do with the fact that I am happy presently, that I would even venture to say I'm content in many ways ... and I post as much on a fairly daily basis.

Granted, I brushed him off at first as 'just another pretty boy'. I steretyped him and I'm a bit disappointed in myself for having done such.

"event","Nothing much happening just been chillin' and working didn't get out of work on time but its cool got to work with Jodi and amanada. Jodi is the bomb, love working with her and having good conversations. But the inventory sucked after everyone but Jodi and Amanda left. Hopefully have plans this weekend to do something if not its cool and if we do something great. Glad our buildings pipes haven't frozen yet (knock on wood) getting up to paint in the morning sucks especially when you don't get a good nights sleep two nights in a row, but one was my fault. but the money will be nice once i get it and be able to have some extra money next week to spend and do some fun things can't wait for school to start back up or wait just for people to come back up here missing people I didn't expect to miss and not knowing how I feel about people right now a little confussed to say the least but I hope I will figure things out before I make to many stupid decisions and either hurt myself or someone else.... not good but hey you know I am only human and it sucks but I make a lot of mistakes. But usually dont think too much about them but not the case lately."

"event","Well, over all things are okay but just have a lot on my mind lately and it sucks sorry if you catch the bitchy side of me of a day, it's probably not you. It may apply to one or two... wait lets just say a hand full of people. But then agian I don't know why for some of them. It sucks cause i have feelings for two people but I know it won't happen so why try??? Even though I don't do anything and know I don't have a chance it still kinda hurts sometimes well. only usually when i feel lonely been trying to keep busy to keep my mind off things but that only works so long then i get tired and try to head to bed and lay awake in bed thinking about it most of the night. Anyone got sleeping pills??? Cause i could use them but anyways enough on that. Hopefully i can get a lot of hours in on paint crew and i'll get to work with Alyssa and Chris more cause Love working with them they make me smile. Well I am going to head out and chill with some friends maybe who knows we will see where the car takes me."

"event","Well today i got to paint and shit with cory andy and jill had a blast. Had a visitor and that  was fun too getting him to get red and keep coming back for more. Then had movie night with jill and watched chicago and listen to the heater pipes make weird noises like they were going to explode. Fun times let me tell you. Also got to see my girl Karina today my other half is back so that means i won't miss behave anymore. Well, not stupidly miss behave. Can't say that it will compeletly stop me but it will make me think alittle bit more before acting on impulse. Oh yeah can't for get Racheals comment to the last posting love her so much god if i weren't gay I would probably give her some to relieve some sexual tention that we are both having lol know that i am there for you sweetie"

"event","Hey getting redy to head to bed sore as hell from skiing and working but hey the money will be good. once i get it :) Things are a little better but life would be grand if ......... yeah don't think i'll put that there if you wanna know go ahead and ask me if I feel you should know or are loved enough by me you'll find out ;) but then again why would i do something like that not like i am nice or anything. Gotta love talking to people on the phone and then getting hung up on... oh wait nope not hung up on but oh wait gotta go click, gotta love not waiting for a response but then again all gay guys sucks at life starting to think girls would be a better choice only if they lacked the box thing lol but hey I will find someone for me at some point in my life before i get too old a hope at least.  Yeah for Racheal.... she knows a cute gay boy haven't seen a picture yet but her taste in men isn't bad except for one (and you know who Racheal) lol no names need to be said but I am off to bed now I know its early but I am getting to old for this shit."

"event","Yeah so I have come to the conclusion that life sucks and it keeps getting worse. Work sucks, only if I could get more hours a different boss make that bosses they both suck right now. Lets be nice to my face and say he didn't mean to give me that few hours but the schedule prove other wise. I guess he should learn that if you are going to lie try whiting out the little (*) on the sides of the days before you tell me a bunch of shit. Fucking asshole, and the dumb bitch that is just like oh it sucks but i have 50 hours look, yah shut up bitch i felt like saying, you got those hours cause your a manager but you don't do that much. I could do your job with my eyes closed, no lie either. SO yeah that is the work thing and then there's just my life in general that sucks right now. I wish that i could just stop time and go back and do so many things differently in life and maybe it would be ten times easier right now. Why does it have to be so complicated and make you feel like you are scum of the earth. Well wait maybe it is things that i do that cause that so guess i am the cause of that feeling. Life would be  freakin' grand if you could just go day to day and do whatever you wanted to do and not have to think about it ever again. Guess i kinda do that anyways and think i am not going to have problems with the things that i do but lately I guess i have more of a heart than usually and it kinda sucks. I hate being and feeling so vonerable. I hate opening up to people and usually don't do it but guess what shit i've fucked up again. Big fuckin' deal story of my life. Alls I can say is that.... wait ..... not going to say that. bad thoughts oh so much to tell but oh so not wanting to sound like an ass; but yet still feeling like one. I guess the up beat to life right now is that i passed all my classes even though i shouldn't have. How I get passing grades with never going to class and either half assing the work or doing it really late is a wonder to me. Guess i must be doing something kinda right in life could have fooled me. Went home had a great dinner with the mum and colored her hair for her, ( the gay things I do for her... Wait i am so who cares) just a little side note. Grabbed a whole bunch of laundry and brought it back to school. Also died again on the highway starting to think that I either need to change things in my life or death is coming soon. Between falling asleep at the wheel and waking up before hitting the gaurd rail and then tonight with the freakin' white out on the highway couldn't see 3 feet in front of the car and people not know how to drive and what speeds to during weather like. Oh man enough on the subject. Man i am feeling like i want a beer or a stiff drink right now. But wait need to lose some weight and get a better body so should stay away for that. OH yeah and those that were pleasured enough to see my last rendition that i was shit face know every emotion or feeling that I have comes out of me when I am that trashed. Kinda feel weird about that still to some people but gotta get over it sometime. Don't for get my chair lift rides hungover and good times with blocker making fun of me. Damn why I do things like that to myself I wonder. Well I am going to stop venting for a bit because I am going to try and lay down now so i can go skiing in the morning and maybe relieve some stress and not feel so shitty about life. prob won't happen but its a thought at least gotta have hopes in life or what the point in living???? Answer that one for me and we'll be good"

"event","After not being able to sleep decided to get up and check away messages; checked Heathers and found this decided that i had some free time and figured that I would give it a shoot. Talked to Colleen and she gave me my screen name cause i am so tired right now I can't think so just really going to randomly type today. After all this is what it is for. I am bored watching the re-runs of the Real World New Orleans but hey Danny is cute so its not that bad. Car didn't start yesterday hoping it is just the battery. Went to the 313 the other night with my AE ""hag"" and ""Twink""; for the most part I had fun hope it wasn't too much for the ""Twink"" and the ""hag"". She was a little hurt that no one hit on her and that all the guys she thought were hot were gay. But the ""Twink"" and I enjoyed looking at all the cuties there. Even though he got hit on by a guy named Dan and wanted nothing to do with him and He didn't know how to take a hint. Ended up leaving. The ride home was okay talked about his thoughts and what he was thinking and feeling dropped him off and then took the Hag home jamming to the music in the car. I am so glad that we went and even though i was out of my comfort zone it was good to get out and have a little bit of fun. Oh almost for got about the AE outing for Kel's going away party. We had a blast at the Outback in concord, I bet they were glad to get rid of us. after all we had to things from the restaurant to remember the trip. Kel hows that menu with all our info on the back and what's in that drink again :) Well I guess i should try and head off to bed seeing how I have to work in the morning but only if I can get my car to start or get a new battery and see if that works."

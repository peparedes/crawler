The life and times of Justin Wiese are doing better then they have in a while.

I've got a a new girl, and i couldn't be happier. She's really just what i want.
I got laid off, but i'm looking for a new job. Money ain't a thing.
My band is playing more shows. That's killer.

"event","i'm honestly not sure if my current girlfriend wants to be with me or not. Its a terrible feeling, and i don't want to feel this way, but the constant hints that she could be interested in another are overwhelming. The constant hints that she doesn't want me, and doesn't want me there with her everyday, are overwhelming.
She's always insulting me, and not in the normal comical way. She fights deep and really tries to hurt me. There is a motive behind this, but i just don't understand what. Doesn't she see how much i love her and need her? Why does she put me through this?
And why also does she constantly bring up other guys and how cool they are and how much she wants to hang out with them, but then will completely snub me when i want to hang out? Its frustrating.
What if everyone else was right about this? All my friends, my family and even my heart warned me that this wasn't a good idea. I feel completely hopeless and i want to crawl up in a ball and die."

"event","Why is it that Christmas this year was planned to be the best ever, but as of right now, i'm holy confused, frustrated and just uneasy about everything thats going on? I'm back with Brittany after a month of talking about it, and i do love her, and i do miss her, and i know i should believe her when she says the same, but i'm still uneasy about it. My friends back home aren't very happy we're back together, and i worry about it sometimes too. I hope its for real, it's gotta be for real. She did some terrible things to me, and part of me hasn't entirely forgave her, but when i look at her face when she's cuddled up next to me on the bed, its hard for me to think of anything  but her. I'm scared of falling head over heels in love again if i still have uncertainties, because as completely backwards that sounds, i think it might happen to me. 

On a related note, girls in Dayton started hitting on me after i got back with Brittany. Which is lame. Don't get me wrong, i love my brittany to death, and i don't want to be with anyone else, but where were these girls when i was lieing alone in my apartment for 2 months? I could have at least used some comfort.

I can't wait for Christmas to be over so i can finally buy stuff for myself. And i'm not being selfish, i'm just saying, money has been going towards presents instead of food lately. lame. I've got a huge list of records i need to buy, and when i say need, i mean NEED. 

Grr, i'm so frustrated with myself and i inability to forget about things. i remember to much, and maybe thats hindering my relationships with everyone i know. i need a fucking hug, homey."

Disgusting critter, it must
We should have known better then to trust
This disease infested ball of lust and carnation
Piece of garbage with wings and she has the guts to sing
Get the bird, catch her shoot her, I dont care
Get the bird, bring her down to the ground from out the air
Gotta tear her apart, let me at her first
Sink her to the level of the rest of us that inherit the earth

What's she thinking? does she really believe
That shes above the creatures that work the dirt and the streets
See her up in the tree, looking down at you and me
Like she's chosen over those who walk around on two feet
The bird, the melodys she play
The music she make, rubbing our faces in the feces of the daybreak
Trying to remind us, its time to awake
Antaganizing and instigating my hate
The chirps, I turn them into screams
My feathered friends end will justity the means
Disturbed, I'll grab her by her beak
And swing her in circles untill she's too dizzy to speak

Well I'll shake her from her branch, tear apart her nest
Break her skinny legs and fry her eggs up for breakfast
(she's a snake that can fly) she's just food for the fleas
She thinks she's better then me just because she's free?

Got some Nick Cave today, plus some Mastodon, Wu Tang, Jesus Lizard, and Black Keys. Listened to the Black Album (that's Jay-Z, bitches) quite a bit today.  I also got an advanced copy of the new Pig Destroyer; shit fuckin' slays babies.
I can't wait to go to Chicago this fall, it'll be such a good time. I just want to walk around the city while it snows and buy lots of records and see some shows with this one cute friend of mine. It'll be a good time. 
I'm ordering a denim sherpa jacket cause i'm a fuckin trendy bastard. 
I need some new jeans. Give me some money, i'm blowing it all. 
I also need some new shoes. Goddammit.
And i really need to pick up the new Mastodon cd and the Murder City Devils DVD. And the new Converge drops next week. Fuck.
Will someone buy all of this shit for me? I'm in a fuckin' rut, bitches. I need Christmas to cum early this year.

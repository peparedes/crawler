"event","Ok!! So its about time for an update, its been way too long. I got a new job at Tim Hortons and it is going great!! I worked today from seven am to three and now I an kinda tired, I worked 7-3 yesterday too. I've got tomorrow off though, so thats good. I am typing this entry on my new laptop which is incredibly exciting. I got it for christmas from my mother. I am suposed to hang out with my boyfriend today but he hasnt called me yet since he called me at 5 something to tell me he was working late. So now I'm playing with my new laptop and I got the Internet working!! I've got some kinda complicated boy issues. Last Friday I did a kinda stupid thing and gave my number to a guy at bowling...yes while I was bowling on the legue with my boyfriend and his aunt and uncle. I was pissed off at him and acting rashly. Then on Sat (while my boyfriend was at a family christmas party which I was not invited to) I went to this guys house, Gary is his name, and hung out till like 3am. It was me, Stacey, Gary, his friend Bill, and Gary's awsome dad Gary Sr. SO... it was so much fun and I would love to be friends with Gary still but that is totally not going to happen and me and Joel stay together. Mine and Joels relationship is more important to me then that. Also, I think that Gary kinda was hoping to not be just friends, so it would be wrong to continue talking to him and lead him on. Ok, so now I have to tell Gary I can not be his friend and still see him and his dad every fri! What am I going to say to him?"

"event","Ok, so I haven't writen for a while, but the job search is going great. I'm hoping for Potbellies or better. The problem is, I can't be hired in as a manager, I have to start out as a crew member, a grunt. But I'll be making nearly as much as I am now and should totally have more hours. Also, I'm getting all sorts of info from the schools job placement office so thats neat. Anyway, I gotta get ready for class! Ta!"

"event","Ok, so I'm glad that its all over, and I'm so done talking about the election. I just have to say that I'm sad that Bush won, and that proposal two passed. I still am not sure if proposal one is good or bad, but whatever. And, finally, I am very happy that my city's proposal 3 passed, effectivly giving more money to the police and fire departments without more taxes (which means the money has to come from somewhere, and cuts will probably happen in the recreation department where I currently work)...but eventually I'll be  a cop, so it's a good thing."

"event","So, yesterday kinda sucked as far as being halloweeny, we were gonna watch scary movies, but we didn't. Playing with Anna and David was a lot of fun though. (They're my boyfriend's aunt and uncle's foster kids.) Well, Anna is in the process of being adopted by them and David is a brand new foster kid. She's 13 and he's 9 and they're tons of fun. Combine them with Aaron and Rob from church and it was a little crazey in that house. But then Anna and Dave went to bed and it was just the older ""kids"" and Tim and Melinda. Me and Joel watched crossing jordan on tv (which I never used to like, but Melinda watches it all the time and it's actually pretty good.) While everyone else hung out around the dining room table. Then we were supposed to leave, and I was glad because they were all talking politics and moral values in the dining room. So I was ready to go... Ready to go... Ready to go... But we weren't going... And I finally couldn't help myself any more and I had to contribute my opinion. Of course I was up against a group of religious zealots, and besides, most people who have opinions about the 'hot' issues are never going to change their minds no matter who argues with them. I just pisses me off that people can be so pig headed. OK... Abourtion... I think it's totally obvious that sometimes it sould be allowed, in certain circumstances it is totally acceptable. They don't, it's 'murder', blah blah blah. It wouldn't bother me so much if they weren't so hypocritical about it, Anna was sexually molested before she went into foster care. If she was raped and she conceived a child, I do believe 100% that she should be allowed to choose and abortion. There is absolutely NO reason to force her to go through with having a baby after something that traumatic. I also believe that Tim would agree in that situation. But, and here's the hypocritical, he would never be in a position to be a cop, because if he ever had to take a child molester into custody, he would kill him and not lose any sleep over it. THAT is hypocritical. and in makes me angry. And I'm not even gonna get started on their views of homosexuals, but the next time that topic comes up, you can bet I'm gonna say something."

"event","So, tomorrow's halloween! I think halloween is a great holiday. This year my sister and I did not carve pumpkins. We were supposed to go and get pumpkins the night that me and Jackie fought, but the fighting kind of put the kabosh on that plan. And now, with her broken thumb, mom says Jackie can't even clean out a pumpkin and I have never liked the cleaning out part of the pumpkin carving process (mom always has to take over and finish mine). So...no pumpkins this year. I did, however, make it to a haunted house this year, for the first time since I was, like, twelve or something. And I have to admit, as absolutely terrified as a always have been of haunted houses, this one was kind of a downer. I mean, I got scared, well more like startled, when the guys came out of nowhere. (and I have kind of a personal problem with Michael Myers, who was there, at the entrance AND exit! That was truly terrifying) But besides that, it wasn't nearly as scary as I expected. I don't know if the house wasn't as good, or if I just grew up too much, which totally would suck! I don't want to be too old to get scared! Scary stuff is the best part of halloween. And on top of that, I think that I am going to be stuck going to my boyfriend's aunt and uncles halloween party after church on sunday night!
Anyway, I'm on a break from my stupid job right now, and although noone will notice if I stay at home for half the day, I told my partner that I'd be back at noon do he can go at noon. If we are both gone, we will probably get caught. So now I need to find someting to eat before it's time to go back.
Ta!"

"event","Ok, so are all fifteen year olds insane, or is it just my little sister. I'm looking for a missing shit of mine yesterday and it's nowhere in the house. So I make sure to look everywhere before I go to look in my sister's room. I tell her that I'm going in her room to look and see if maybe mom put my shirt in her clothes on accident, our mom does that a lot. I'm pretty sure that I'll find the shirt in my sister's drawer because this particular shirt is always in her room. I think that she takes it deliberately, it's not moms mistake at all. Anyway, my sis stands in her doorway while I look though her clothes basket. They were clean clothes so I was carefull not to unfold them or anything. She was totally ok with me looking there. Then I go to look in her dresser and she just explodes. She started yelling and screaming at me to get out of her room and mocking me when I try to calm her down. She tells me she doesn't have my fucking shirt and she's not letting me look in her fucking drawers and to get the fuck out of her room. She got so mad about it that she tryed to physically force me out of the room, which, when she is full of adrenline and I am now, she is fully capable of doing, so I wraped my arm around her and took her into the hallway with me. I was still trying to calm her down and tell her she was overreacting about a stupid shirt, and she slammed me across the face. After geting kicked in the stomach, hit in the face a few more times, and having my head bashed into the wall when I was on the defensive and went down beneath her wieght, I fought back a little bit. I felt so bad about it afterward because she's my sister and I love her. Having a good relationship with her, espicallly later in life is important to me. It also really hurts my feellings that she would physically attack me the way that she did. now I'm in physical and emotional pain, all over a stupid shirt, which, by the end of it all, I didn't even care about any more! Well now my sister has a broken thumb, her fault not mine, and I've got a big lump on my head and scraches all over my body, (I was wearing only my bra when all this went down since I had planned to put on the missing shirt!) and possibly a destroyed relationship with my only sistetr!
Now that I've gotten this all written out, I want to change my mood to gloomy and dissapointed."

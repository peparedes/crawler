"event","for the first time in seven months i drove home listening to 'light up my room' on repeat.
if you question what i would do
to get over and be with you
lift you up over everything..
to light up my room

went to see mystic river tonight with jim, pat, mike and tim. very good movie. after we went to a diner in rvc.. i called mike jim in the diner. he was fooling around with the knife and whatnot so when he almost stabbed himself i was like, ""ji-!"" didn't say the m part though. he was like, you almost called me jim! nice slip! but the others were just laughing and started a new conversation, otherwise it would have been very awkward.  talk about freudian slips from the past.

oh yeah and i got a parking ticket for being on the GC streets after 2 am. great.

no matter how long its been since i heard jim play for me.. i still hear his voice over bnl's in that song. listening to it made me think of when we were at his going away bbq and he played it in front of everyone.  i wish i would have stopped him.  i have never felt more obvious in my life.

i want him to play it for me.. just one more time.  thats all i want. 
just one
more
time.
is that so much to ask?"

"event","i had a really weird dream last night. this kid from my french class was in it, and we like made out or something because i was praying..?? i don't know. and it was like, college, and dorms, but they were situated differently. quite odd. then i woke up. and fell back asleep, and the dream continued. it was like me, my brother and someone else and we had like 20 billion packs of cigarettes and we kept showing them off and like the different tastes or something. then we were in this big hall, and then this person starts playing ""light up my room"" coming from the back of the room, but i knew it was an oldie, and i was like, so that wasn't even jims song, he stole it.. and because of the song i ran out of the room and there was jim sitting on the stairwell smoking cigarettes in the shadows. i jumped over him and down the steps... and my alarm went off. :( what an odd dream.
i'm watching dawsons creek... why? i don't know. it reminds me of middle school times.. haha. i remember my brother singing the theme song in a high falsetto.. so funny.  i'm like, aw i remember watching this with my family and being so excited for the next episodes.  
yay i can't wait to go home!! 4 days :) and then 19 days... and then i'll never have to leave my city again. unless mike kidnaps me and takes me to france. lol.

i don't feel <i>real</i>
its hard to explain actually. how does one not feel real?  
well i don't feel like i'm really here. i don't feel like my thoughts are my own, and my vision is very weird. its not that i'm dizzy, but almost like i'm looking behind someone elses eyes, or like trying to walk through the city or something with a camera in front of your face. but it has more of a surreal quality to it.  i always feel like i'm about to fall down, but not because i'm dizzy, but because i feel like my legs are stilts or fake or something.  i always feel dirty, even right after my shower. the dirty feeling never goes away, except in the shower for about 5 minutes.  the water is so scalding hot i look like a lobster. but i feel its the only way to feel clean.. otherwise i just feel dirty. and i hate this dirty feeling. 
i've been so distracted lately. for instance, i just stared at my can of tomato soup for a long time. at least 6 songs. i was never able to estimate how much time has passed.. ever. 
DON'T YOU GET IT? ITS ALWAYS DARKER IN MY EYES...

hmm.. haven't updated in a VERY long time.
after december 19th, miami will no longer be my home.  i know i hate it here, i look around and loathe everything around me.  but i can't help get the feeling that i won't really be happy anywhere.
i don't want to grow up. i want to stay in high school.  i don't want to have to provide for myself in a few years. i don't want to have to work.
i'm afraid of fucking up.  i'm afraid of being poor.  i'm afraid of being unhappy.

i guess i need to be happy to begin wtih though.

i'm so jealous of all my friends that like their colleges.  its probably just because no one went to fucking ohio though.  i feel like i should stay just so i can say, you know what, i can do this. i told you i could and i did. but i'd probably end up having a mental breakdown if i had to stay here in the land of katie keoghs.
i've been feeling so down lately.  i haven't and still can't articulate my feelings well.  
i hate how my parents tell me to ""suck it up"" if somethings wrong.  i'm just waiting for my hand to become obsolete, to blow something in my knee or to have a mental breakdown and then i can be like , ha. i fucking told you so.
ah. i hate people. i hate how i didn't really have any friends back home, even though i thought i did.  i don't think i'm going to really tell anyone i'm coming home.. because its not like they will care anyway.

hmm.. okay so. i finally met william. took long enough. shit. fun times as usual with twin. 
i guess it was.. last night. me and mike had a big convo on college and relationship-y stuff. it was a really bad and a makemewanttocry conversation, but i think we finally got somewhere.  which is nice.
i guess basically what it comes down to is.. i want to marry him. i don't care if its ""we're too young"" ""we haven't being going out that long"" blah whatever. because i know. i want to fall asleep and wake up next to him everyday for the rest of my life. which is nice to know. we talk about what our house is going to look like and what are wedding is going to be like [no people. just me him and a priest-type dude] and its.. wonderful.  but at college we're going to see other people. just to make sure. to see if we're really right for one another.  i figured that was best.. and even though hes afraid [and i am too] i think it will be okay.
i spent most of last night thinking about jim. and about how.. even though i still love him [i can never really stop loving him] i don't want to be with him. i guess i never really wanted to be with him after a certain point, but i just wanted closure. it ended on such a bad note.  bitter e-mails were sent back and forth, and in a way i'm glad my brother wiped my computer downstairs because now i can't revisit the shit that makes me ache all over.  i suppose i'll just never really get closure on that. i said in the reply to his e-mail the night he left.. i just wanted to clear things up about me and you.. but somehow i don't really think there is a ""me and you"" anymore. and its true. i can't help but think about winter.. and when this all started. and then i wonder if i had chosen jim how things would have been. but in this moment, right now, and many times when i think about it, i made the right choice. i didn't make the right choices afterwards.. but mikey is it for me.
what a boring post this is. just a bunch of rambling from the mind of kate.. i can't even put down what i mean. and it never makes sense.
i'm so scared of college. i'm so scared that i won't do well in my classes and that no one will like me. i'm afraid of everything changing. my parents selling this house soon.. not being in high school anymore.. and i'm finally afraid. it only took until 8 days before i leave for me to finally feel it fully.. but yeah. i'm scared.
its so scary that me leaving is in single digits now. i remember when i was counting down during the school year and it was like 200. now its 8.

i asked him if he could at least do the song for me on tape when he comes down to visit.. and he said maybe. he'll ""do what he can"". i said, but you promised. and he said, i know i promised.. i'll try.
hes forgotten so many things. it just makes me so sad how things changed. you don't love someone and then forget their birthday two months later. i think he was just trying so hard to get over the whole kaitlyn thing. thats how it all happened. he never really meant any of the things he said. i mean, he thought he meant them, but it was just him subconsciously trying to get over kaitlyn. and it sucks that he has a piece of me.. that i'll never get back, and i never really had him. not really.
i miss the sound of his voice, his laughter, his sighs in between sentences. i miss our phone calls that went on for hours..

spent the night at home.. again. but it was by choice. i am utterly exhausted. speaking of udders, i saw 'son in law' on tv last night. such an odd/very bad movie. this afternoon i went to jc penneys for dorm shopping. so scary!! i got sheets, towels, blankets, and mattress pads. it was a shock to actually be doing it, and i am so tired i hated doing it but i felt accomplished like i actually did something for once. 
i've been so tired as of late.  i feel like i have mono again. my throat hurts.
i'm gonna go watch some more tv because.. yes. thats all i do. yep."

-- ah the song that defines everything going through my heart right now is by simple plan. 
tonight was okay. got pedicures with em and kristin.. hung out with ben and mike as well. did a bunch of nothing-ness crap and so forth. mike called me after i dropped ben and mike off, and i had no idea who it was. i was like, hello? he said hello? i said hello? again, he said hello? again, and then another hello? from me. another hello? from him. so me thinking it was a wrong number of sorts, i said, ""who is this?"" and he was like mike. i still had no idea. haha. i thought it was the other mike. so i was like, whos phone is this and he says his uncles so THEN i knew it was lep. i think i made him feel bad, but whatever. i really don't feel like talking to him or responding to his messages. he asked if i had gotten them and i said i had. whatever i just didn't feel like responding to them.
jimmy was online tonight. i wasn't home to talk to him though :( he IMed me said hey doll and finished the song on my away message. i was hoping he sent me an e-mail or something.. but i can't really expect that of him. i guess we're past that when i expected a text message.. i expected a phone call. then it all just... stopped. i used to depend on those. i remember being on the phone with him for four hours. it was the night that scott sloane died and the same night that i got an in school suspension for smoking. i remember just telling him so many things i never told anyone else.. and he was so.. there. so comforting. so understanding. as always i guess. 
stop this. stop it now. because its only going to lead to bad bad things."

"event","i wonder if he ever thinks of me the way i think of him...
tonight was okay. i was going to go to the beach this morning, but when i initially woke up [at 10 am to the sound of my phone ringing..] i was very.. upset. mike called; i feel bad because i didn't really want to talk to him. its 10 in the morning, and he wakes me up and thinks its okay. i mean, i guess it usually would have been okay, but after last night with the reliving shit [as i always do] and this whole FREAKING like 4 or 5 months of fucking reliving shit i just don't want to deal with him. hes gone, and i feel bad that i don't really miss him. i miss someone else..
which is funny because he probably doesn't ever even give me a second thought.. a fleeting moment in which he misses me. why would he? after all that he[we] went through.. or i guess in his mind what i <i>put</i> him through. he can be such a dick to me and to other people, yet i still have this... yearning for him. for his arms to be around me just once more. how pathetic am i. I HATE THIS FEELING. all i want.. is to not think of him. god i feel like i'm back in jaketimes. except jim was long gone by then. i feel so pathetic.useless.stupid.hopeless and a fucking WASTE of space. 
i look back at how things got started.. and it just kills me that i was such an idiot. that i acted on what <i>other</i> people wanted me to do.. what other people thought was right. not what i wanted. something heather said while this was going on rings true now.. but i didn't see it then. i didn't see what my heart really wanted then. all i was worried about was hurting people and getting others mad at me for hurting them. when i didn't even think about what i wanted. what i FUCKING wanted. and now i'm stuck here.. always thinking. and its times like these that i regret that i quit smoking. and quit drinking.. wow how i miss those 11 pm screwdrivers. 
god why can't i just ignore it[him] and get on with my life. so many things that i keep revisiting break my heart. ha he said he'd never leave.. and he did. he said he'd be there for me.. and he wasn't. he said he'd play that song.. the song that makes my soul ache.. for me. he didn't. i guess it might be just him trying to.. get away. 'bury his feelings' as he put it. but if he did that, he'd still have the memory. and he wouldn't forget something that i thought was so special but apparently it wasn't cause he opens it and is like, ""wha..?"" so great. here i am, again. feeling for someone more than he feels for me.
""torn and tattered

funny how familiar it feels.
My soul is aching for
a breath of happiness.
The rain won't stop.
Why do I always feel like SHIT on the really nice days?

Thoughts of you ruin my chances.
Can't I get through a day without breaking down?
My emotions are running low.
All I feel is emptied sadness.
I don't care anymore.
Apathy is a virtue I hold dear.

"event","so the past two days [i think] have been interesting. yesterday was my stay-up-for-more-than-40 hours day. i went to oz with candice and heather. very very fun. danced a lot, had scary guys dance with me until i turned around and was like, uh, no. me and heather were standing by the bar and i was like, man i love black guys. right then two black guys came over and started dancing with us. haha when they left heather said, ""man i love hot guys"" :::looks around::: didn't work though :(
around 3:30ish we left and went to this 24 hour bagel place with a few of candices friends. then.. on to hottub de rieba. or something. it was good fun, even though i was mad tired. so i fell asleep around 6, woke up at 3ish and i'm still extremely tired.
talked to jake this afternoon.. he just got back from being away and he didn't IM me to finish the convo.. oh how sad. oh well. said some weirdish things i guess. not really.. but whatever.
jake (6:10:35 PM): are u involved with a male species
silly boy. he makes me laugh. oh wait.. he made me cry too.. haha how quickly one forgets.
i was at the beach yesterday morning and i got burned. quite badly too. its entertaining for me at least, i have like two white spots on the sides of my stomach because i guess the sun only hit the part that was sticking out.. my gut. lol
boo i'm very tired. and all sneezy."

i'm supposed to go to oz tonight, but i don't know if i'll be up to it. this vise grip on me isn't loosening..
why are my thoughts lately always about jimmy? what is is about him? unfinished business i guess is the best answer i can think of. its like in 'the big chill'.. except they were in college. my mom always said, high school boyfriends are nice, but find the man you're gonna marry in college because after that its all the guys girls rejected. shes such a weirdo sometimes i swear.
i miss my parents actually. its scary being home alone.. especially reading the only book that succeeds in frightening me so much.
i have nothing of interest to say.. i think i'll go to the beach. wait for candice to be at national and walk it. or something. we'll see.

"event","today was .. uneventful as usual. and its only 6:15. oh well.  
i woke up early, thankfully. maybe i can fall asleep before 5 am for once.
yesterday i went to the movies with kristin. we stopped at target before hand [i got shoes for $8 and a pink polka dot bathing suit] and jimmy called me. just returning my call, blah blah. i tried to sound happy for his sake, but he knew. oh god i could tell. he says hes going to find time to call me sometime this week and whatever. i miss him. i want to visit him so badly but i'm afraid he won't want me to come up by myself. anyway. pirates of the carribean.. good movie. only because i want to have johnny depp's and orlando bloom's babies. johnny depp + eyeliner = drool. 
i started It again. i don't know why. i was writing my favorite song lyrics on a purse of mine, and then i thought of my favorite quotes from books so i got my favs.. i think i sat for fully 20 minutes outside with It on my lap, debating whether or not to start it again. i don't think i'm ready to read it again, but here i am. reading it. oh well. i love that book.. its the book that got me through 8th grade semi-happy[andalive] so i ought to pay it homage every year or so.
every time i pass my piano i see the pieces staring up at me begging to be played. i see the dust settling on the key guard-y thingy. whatever its called. but i just can't bring myself to disgrace such a beautiful instrument. i can't bring myself to touch those keys that used to bring me such solace.. [if thats even the word i'm looking for. my natural working thesaurus has apparently taken a vacation] i see 'lullabye' sitting there on the rack, and all i think about is that [painfully obvious tear choked] voice mail jimmy left me once. and how it finally erased itself ironically on the night of his going away barbeque. i think about how i played it for him once and he sang along. 
i can't even attempt to touch my guitar anymore.. not after he played 'light my room' and 'hazey eyes', albeit badly since its a lefty guitar.. i just feel like i'm ruining whatever fragile threads that are still tying me to him, wanting to break.
i feel so empty.. <i>so alone</i>.
don't really feel like doing anything right now.. anymore. whatever.
its funny how we, or at least i, revert to the activities that engulfed my life eighth grade.. end of soph, all of junior year.. and senior year. god nearly my entire high school career was wasted to the fucking grips of something unknown and only seen as lines on peoples faces. i make no sense."

"event","so i'm sitting here watching the mtv true life thing about long beach high school.. and i'm trying to think about why exactly four years ago i decided that long beach high school wasn't right for me. watching this show, my answers that i have been repeating for four years seem trivial. i miss the public school aura. i miss having boys in my school. 
as the prom part came up, the dj said, ""long beach are you ready??"" and i was thinking.. thats me. that should be me. i'm long beach, not sacred heart. those were my friends on national tv. keyword being were. but since i was a bitch i cut ties and went to a fucking catholic school where everyone was a clone. [almost everyone..] 
i am extremely jealous of my brother for having gone to lbhs. for deliberately not putting chaminade as his first choice and therefore being sent to lbhis by my parents. so jealous that he had friends in his own town, and not a half hour away. that he went to school with his girlfriend. that he had such a blast in high school.. and i went to a catholic school a half hour away. a half hour away from my beach.
and now.. i'm going to ohio.  it fits so perfectly with my decision four years ago but i think only i can see it. which is good.
i should have gone to trinity.. no. <b>long beach high school.</b>
i should have kept ties here in long beach.
i should have picked a cheaper school...
i should have done so many things. so many things that stay here in my mind.. cluttering it. so much shit happened. why did the last two years of high school suck so hard for me, but rocked for my brother? why do my parents always think i'm like him? they always act like i'm dumb [or fat..] and that i don't know how to handle anything. they have no idea who i am.. at all. during orientation i was freaking out.. but thats just me. thats who i am. thats what i do to get things under control. and my dad makes some dickass remark about ""failing out too"" what the HELL. i am NOT MY BROTHER IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. i actually want to do something wtih my life. i dont' give a shit what other people think of me. i don't do shit just because someone tells me to. i wont' fucking mess up in college the way he did.

theeennn going to visit jimmy this weekend. :-D i'm driving up there sadly.. maybe i'll make hudson take his car, because i want to go see jimmy again and i don't want my car making the trip like 4 times.
wow i just remembered this dream i had. i had like a new cadillac, it had the new sedan grille but it was an suv. ozzy osbourne was there, and there was this creepy house we were in. there were baked beans like boiling, but they weren't over a fire.  it was like my moms birthday or something. but with the car, i was trying to study or decide to study for like physical science. when i go to get out, kate cronin and her family come around, and her brother starts to play with the steering wheel and i had to yell at him. he was really tall and didn't look like himself at all, even though i've only seen him a few times.

i was washing my face in the upstairs bathroom and the window was open. i could hear the surf crashing against the sand.. and i heard little kids screaming with delight. oh i would give anything for those summer days at the beach where we played silly games in and out of the water.
it is amazingly hot right now. even my basement is warm. yuck.
going to...
- call christina, find out if pool party is still on
- call twin, see if she wants a ride
- gas up car
ahh.. and then, i'm coming home early to read harry potter. i feel really sick and i don't want to go out tonight.. boo."

"event","jims leaving tomorrow. why is this so hard? maybe i was just looking for a reason to cry. i doubt thats it.
i feel so .. alone. things we used to do, he barely remembered. he accused me of false feelings.. what about him? i haven't forgotten a single thing.. and he breaks my heart by wondering aloud why this one part of the present is significant?  i guess i deserve it since i broke his heart.
i wrote him an e-mail. i texted him telling him to read his e-mail. probably still with liz. a stupid soph gets preference over me?  he couldn't even put time aside for the only thing i wanted.. the only thing i requested of him in so long. i feel so hurt.  and here i sit.. in silence for a change.. wondering why he couldn't do one little thing that would have taken 5 minutes for me.. for the girl whom he would play for anytime. but five minutes.. five minutes out of an entire night .. he couldn't. instead he plays in front of everyone.. leaving me to cry in the bathroom.  i guess i'm just shocked that he didn't know that the song would have that effect on me. 
i guess 'always' isn't as long as i thought.."

"event","ahh been feeling a bit weird lately. tonight was ""senior night"" what a gay bag event.  watching the yearbook video only reaffirmed my choice at not participating in things such as red and gold.  had a fun time at applebees with posse minus kat plus michelle patty and kristin.  twin was missed.  went home.. yeah.
rob called me.  that made me feel really good.  he just wanted to thank me for the card.. i felt so random because he wasn't even home and his brother was just like, uhh no hes at the doctors. oh well.   so yay for friends that you used to stalk in freshman year.. what? no..
i've been stalking that barenaked ladies song lately. too bad its only on a tape..
too much thinking for me.  i think i should make some changes... and i think i know where to start. too bad it'll be hard...
ahh saturday is graduation. awesome.  i already feel like i'm rid of the school.. too bad i have to go back tomorrow.. and the day after.. and the day after... YUCK. but yays i'm not going to the liturgy. oh my god this entries are SO boring. why do i keep doing it.
in any case. 
i'm going to borrow a video camera [or get my own] so i can get all my friends .. cause i have that many... and bring it to college. i want to get jimmy singing ""light up my room"" on tape. and then i can just have everyone being friendly and such.. i have to get jimmy before he leaves for upstate tho.. for everyone else i have until just about til i leave..
anyway. gonna go watch TV again.. and yeah. 
<b>if you question what i would do.. to get over and be with you. lift you up over.. everything.. to light up my room...</b>"

pj's house was fun.  i like mikes friends a lot more than i like my own haha. it was so chill just sitting by the fire the entire night, even tho it was fucking FREEZING. way to go kate.. just bring scrubs. great. lol.  had a [finally] real conversation with kevin. so many times we just hung out and it was like, hey whats up, yeah cool music.  but we actually had a really great conversation at like 3 in the morning.  so chill, even though he was mad drunk and he kept repeating himself.  it was so great to just kind of like get to know him better, because hes just such an awesome guy. finalllyy have a surfing instructor. haha.
i went in the water! mistake. really cold. haha and i went in in my underwear.. ah pat got a free show for that one. lol. 
anyway. still insanely tired. gotta go drop off my film... and wait for my prom yay.

mike sends me a text message saying ""i'm free this weekend!"" okay.. do you want a chew toy or a dog biscuit? i thought you were going to be gone, so i made plans. its so stupid because he like doesn't talk to me all day yesterday, when i send him messages and he doesn't respond. great. whatever. found out something interesting concerning him today.. oh and i probably have people mad at me now.. well not mad but because they think i lied.. haha which i kinda did. its not like i lied, i just didn't tell them. selective telling i guess.  but whatever. i don't have the energy nor the patience to deal with them.
aggghhh. saturday i believe i'm hanging out with heather.. and NOT mike. muhaha. i'm evil.

Lost in

Lost... in

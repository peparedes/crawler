"event","OK so come to find out that this bitch (I use that term not in the generic, any female sense but a true, rotten, worthless stupid excuse for a ""woman"") at work quit, and she blamed her demise soley on me.  I was ""mean"" to her when she asked me questions, and I always seemed aggravated with her, she told the boss.  And I was, justifiably so, she is by far one of the most irritating people I have ever encountered.  Slow and stupid, constant questions and problems and questions and comments and questions, questions, questions. But my replies were never outwardly hateful.  I was not her friend, and the only conversations we ever shared were the ones she butted in on.  But my replies to her incessant questions were adequate and decently toned, especially considering how deep rooted my distaste with her is/was/will ever be.  I never swore or raised my voice.  OK so maybe I did have a slight attitude with her, but if the woman understood how deep my disdain for her was she would be grateful for the courtesy she received, no matter how minimal.  It burns me to the core to know that this bitch went tattling, not only about my supposed rudeness but the fact that I was ""constantly talking about dope.""  Again, let me state that I never intentionally talked to this woman.  She tried (unsuccessfully, usually) to chime in, laughing at every comment and adding commentary where she could fit it in.  Yes, me and my FRIENDS (everyone in the room, except her) have made more than one reference to dope while on the clock.  It bothered Pookie that we could casually use dope, without it destroying our entire lives.  Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention that she was a ""recovering"" crack addict who was busted by the police selling crack OUT OF THE OFFICE six years ago.  Out of THIS office, that we work in now.  She convinced the bosses that she had rehabilitated herself and was in need of a part time job. You think she would come in, meek and humble, thankful for ever second chance, right? Like that would be enough to satisfy her.  But noooo she has to go telling on me, like she is trying to dismantle my happy little empire with her whining and bitching about her ""problems"" with me.  Well, Debbie, it did not work.  I am untouchable, as least as this job goes.  And you are on your merry little crack head way.  I hope the next time you light up the rocks explodes in your face.  I would love to watch the flesh burn up and fall off your skull. FUCK YOU!"

"event","OK so this unknown mute they found on the beach of England is breaking my heart.  Has anyone seen the pictures of him?  He looks like he has seen the face of death, and maybe he has.  I get the impression that he can speak, he is not autistic or otherwise mentally handicapped, but something so horrible, so tragic, has happened it has rendered him unable to speak. I hope they can find his family or friends soon.  He looks so terrified, I am scared for, and with, him.  I hate the news, sometimes, because occasionally a story comes along like this one and gets me all worked up. (I was a wreck during the whole Terri Schiavo ordeal) I wish I could pray.  I would definitely pray for him."

"event","I really hate this place.  I answer phones for business who are closed, in office meetings, or who otherwise just don't want to fuck with their obnoxious, needy customers.  I basically get paid to argue with people ALL DAY LONG.  They need people who I can't reach, they want things I cannot give them, like phone numbers of people with the company.  They are upset that they had to wait five minutes before reaching me, and they get only more perturbed that the person who finally picked up the phone is NOT who they were wanting to reach.  The ones that are not upset are so stupid it is surreal.  They don't know their phone numbers and struggle trying to spell their names.  I tell them that I will page someone to call them back, and they often times have to be reminded that one must hang up the phone before someone can RETURN
their call.
But I also love my job.  I can get to sit on my lazy ass all day long, never having to clean, straighten, or stock.  I can come to work in my pajamas with tangled dirty hair. There have been a few occasions I have shown up with no shoes on my feet.  My bosses are benign enough, and usually buy whatever excuse I come up with for a sorry work performance.  I have gotten away with behavior I know I could never excuse in any other work environment, like showing up hours late, having friends visit me and disrupt the entire office while we are working.  I have been busted smoking pot in the office, and there was one occasion when I showed up for my shift with seven shots of tequila coursing through my veins.  For the most part, I love my co-workers, and we have a blast most nights teasing and making jokes at the expense of our mentally challenged callers.  I have met many new friends here, and I am usually saddened when they move on to better paying, legitimate jobs.
  I have been here six and a half years, so I guess I might as well stay.  I get so frustrated sometimes, I would like to gouge my eyes out or set the building on fire, just so I could escape.  But I appreciate the mindlessness of it, really, how simple and laid back it can be.  I guess I am here, until I either suck it up and go back to school, or marry a rich doctor.  I don't see either happening anytime soon.  Now, back to work..."

"event","So I guess me and the boyfriend have finally finished the latest battle of wills.  I am so sick of fighting, but I am notoriously bull-headed when it comes to admitting I was wrong.  In fact, I very rarely if ever feel that I am wrong.  But eventually it becomes apparent that I can either be right, or I can be happy and give a little.  I just don't ever want to be a push over, you know?  Like I have been fucked over in one way or another my whole life, but I have never been one to just roll over and take it.  Every time I am provoked, not matter how minor the issue, I am ready to fight to the death until my point is taken.  I should use this determination for more positive ventures than fighting and screaming until my throat is sore and my voice is cracking.  The louder I scream, the less people hear..."

No matter what you do, no matter who tells you anything, you totally and most definantly need to understand that nothing and when I say nothing I mean nothing is <font color=""#cc99ff"">IMPOSSIBLE<font color=""#ff9900""> yeah so I may not be like all old and stuff, and like supah wise, but yea... from a teenage point of view, i totally realize that all the things people say ya know...the <font color=""#cc99ff"">NEGATIVE<font color=""#ff00ff""> <font color=""#ccffff"">stuff... mean absolutely nothing. Think about it someone tell's you that you can't make it... so it makes you either...think that they aren't worth it or that they are right... so you either try harder or get all like super depressed.... well, either way something about u changed.. and ne thing in that sitch is definantly possible... iono.. jus think about it.. anything can happen... no one ever said it would be like super <font color=""#cc99ff"">POSITIVE<font color=""#ff9900""> <font color=""#ff0000"">but definantly know that yea, anything is possible.. so what ever you do never give up because maybe none of that stuff should be bad and you should definantly make something of your self.. i definantly will, <font color=""#cc99ff"">LIFE'S A GAME...

I'm going to their birthday party this weekend and I think I don't know what to think. I'm too excited about it but my friend is even more excited because Andre is her boyfriend so she's like flippen out. OH but best believe there was a crapload of drama before that. Like I used to like Andre and my friend never thought nothing of him because she had liked this other boy who liked me... so let's call the other boy ""boy C"" so anywayz she liked boy C and I liked Andre... then boy C started flirting w/ me and I didn't tell her i jus turned him down because I was going to stay loyal to friendship first and boys second. Anywayz, so then I guess he started flirting w/ other people while she didn't really try n get w/ him and so i turned him down his brother flirts w/ me and cj waited too long&nbsp;and now he's gotta girlfriend. Anywayz she started chatting&nbsp;w/ the boy i liked and i felt odd because I started liking him on and off so anywayz to sum it up they go together. and well, i'm cool w/ it but unfortuanantly i'm flirting w/ a freshman, who's family is jus the hottest trio of boys... They are all so fucking cute i'm mad at my self and I feel like a maj. rapist... but uh Mwah... until then, thats so far the story of my job!</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Okay so I started off the wonderful new years at my friend andrea's house and i think that was the best yet. At first i thought this was the shittiest new years ever, but the more i thought about it it was 70% from total lack of sleep 10% of having a crush and 10% of jealousy and 10% of hate for the flirtee. But anywayz it was the best one ever! and I learned something new, jus cuz you have a crush on someone and they don't like you get over it! Life goes on, anywayz, wen i get some sleep it will seem completely silly!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=6>New Years Resolutions</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff>This year im going to start a pattern, hopefully that I'll keep for the future. I will write 10 meaningful possible new years resolution's down and then view them everyday and after awhile throughout the year i will mark off if i break them and see what i accomplished by the end of the year. Better focus, better start! LET'S READ THEM RESOLUTIONS</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>1<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>My first resolution is to work on my anger. To be calm cool and collective in any situation. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>2<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Don't take things too personally. Because what i have to realize is that everything is not related exactly to me but could even be funny.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>3<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Don't obsess over boys. I don't need to be obsessive over boys as much as i was last year, if they like me go ahead, if they don't don't stress.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>4<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Focus on school subjects. Concentrate on school before games, play, and fun.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>5<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Don't eat sweets outside of party's or events. If it is jus because u want some tasty sweet and not a serving in a meal at an event then u don't need it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>6<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Be yourself, no matter what otherpeople say being urself doesn't mean shape into what everyone else wants you to be.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>7<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Make friends and keep the old ones. Meet someone and don't come on too strong, be nice and cool.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>8<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Control anger. Work on anger and how we can prevent from overreacting all the time. Relax find methods that work.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>9<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Clean a very deep clean every month. Clean the house to the fullest at least once a month, so it helps work on organization and will to clean up every once in a while.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33 size=7>10<FONT color=#ffccff size=3>Lose at least 30 pds. As cliche as it sounds it is important to be 30 pds lighter by next year to be in weight range.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ffff>These are my new years resolutions, I hope you make yours and stick to them ... I &lt;3 YOU ALL MWAH!</FONT></P>"

Dear Mom,
I went to a party,
And remembered what you said.
You told me not to drink, Mom
So I had a sprite instead.

I felt proud of myself,
The way you said I would,
That I didn't drink and drive,
Though some friends said I should.

I made a healthy choice,
And your advice to me was right,
The party finally ended,
And the kids drove out of sight.

I got into my car,
Sure to get home in one piece,
I never knew what was coming, Mom
Something I expected least.

Now I'm lying on the pavement,
And I hear the policeman say,
The kid that caused this wreck was drunk,
Mom, his voice seems far away.

My own blood's all around me,
As I try hard not to cry.
I can hear the paramedic say,
This girl is going to die.

I'm sure the guy had no idea,
While he was flying high,
Because he chose to drink and drive,
Now I would have to die.

So why do people do it, Mom
Knowing that it ruins lives?
And now the pain is cutting me,
Like a hundred stabbing knives.

Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom
Tell daddy to be brave,
And when I go to heaven,
Put Daddy's Girl on my grave.

Someone should have taught him,
That it's wrong to drink and drive.
Maybe if his parents had,
I'd still be alive.

My breath is getting shorter, Mom
I'm getting really scared.
These are my final moments,
And I'm so unprepared.

I wish that you could hold me Mom,
As I lie here and die.


MADD IS HOPING TO GET 5,000 SIGNATURES ON THIS,
THEN PASS IT ON TO PRESIDENT BUSH. PLEASE SIGN.

"event","Heres some info you guys may want to know about us girls!!

1. There is no such thing as holding hands and hugging too much. It makes a girl feel like you really care.

2. Girls want those HOT moments just as much as you guys do. But they also want to feel like you can have a good talk. Even things out. && You'll be rewarded.

3. Girls will always love getting flowers. Especially for no reason.

4. Saying something sweet will maybe get you out of trouble. Doing something sweet will ALWAYS get you out of trouble.

5. Always tell the truth. Girls find out everything.

6. Stuffed animals are just something to hug when you aren't around. No matter what we say we are secretly hugging them wishing it was you instead. End of story.

7. We love being wrestled with and tickled. No matter how much we scream or beg you to stop. Just dont kill us laughing. Know when to stop.

8. If a girl starts asking questions and sounding suspicious shes not accusing. Shes worried. So try and be kind with your answers. She only cares

9. We will always think we are too fat, too short, to tall, to ugly, or something else. Its nature. It never hurts to compliment us everyonce in a while. Even if we're denying it, We're smiling estatic on the inside.

10. Never tell your guy friends about you and your girls personal information. And if you apt to. Make sure they NEVER find out. Girls are a lot more personal than guys. So speak wisely if you chose to at all."

"event","Alright AlrightAlrgith.. I am now using my livejournal as a ""teen article"" I'm bored and so I'm creating the ""TEEN ZENE HOW TO GUIDE"" That way you know what's going on in my lame life OR NOT and you get to comment on it... If you've ever seen How To Lose a guy in 10 dayz... its like that... well the article is...! I think this is sumthin fun to read.. Anywayz here is the first article 
10 ways to cheat on your man
Everyone has that special someone that they like... then ... they meet another.... and another... and another.. Now you have more than one man that you truly adore... You can't let one go so how do you do it... you cheat.
STEP 1: DON'T LET THEM MEET
The worst thing you could ever do is have them meet someway some how... If they go to the same school the genious thing to do is not to date either one of them. If they are related that is the stupidest (yes i know its not a word) most dumbass thing you could do.. SO DON'T DO IT.. basically don't make it a stupid mixup where they can meet cuz thats ur worst case situation
STEP 2:DON'T MENTION THE OTHER MAN
Seriously dude... pretend that they don't exist... while dating boy 1 do not on any case mention that you know a boy 2 because boy 2 could some way some how (outta your control) know or be cool or completely despise boy 1.
STEP 3: DON'T GET ATTACHED
don't get attached to either boy... because... one way or another if they DO find out then you will get DEEPLY hurt by both of them so DO NOT GET ATTACHED
STEP 4: DON'T LET THEM GET ATTACHED
They will find out and may become extrememe on any circumstance make sure they will have as much want to cheat on you as you are cheating on them... to be plain and simple... make them not want you as much as you want them.. because believe me it is going to be H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS and thats like the worst.
STEP 5: NEVER SCHEDULE ANYTHING
You should not schedule anything because they will wonder why you gotta schedule them in yo life.. Just say hey i got some things i gotta do let me hit you back at blah blah time.. but remember they shouldn't be that attached to you anywayz so it shuldn't b that hard at this point.
STEP 6: MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OVER ANY PROBLEMS
If you are getting over past relationships friendships or family issues... now is NOT the time for you to be dating OR cheating at the least... take some time off.. because you are going to be too into what you are doing to satisfy yourself... you don't wanna screw anything up.
STEP 7: TELL SOMEONE
Make sure you tell someone you COMPLETELY trust NOT to tell on anything because BELIEVE me it comes in handy.. get a friend or a few friends who can keep the secret and can help you follow thru on certain plots
STEP 8: INVITE HIM SOMEWHERE
Make sure he thinks he's the only one ur w/ take him out in tha public...Take your someone that knows about it... so that he thinks he's really the only one and your friends should kinda push that along so that it seems like you guys are the only 2 ur friends know about.
STEP 9: MAKE SURE YOUR FRIENDS DON'T SCREW IT UP
Have a conversation with your friends the night before and tlk about AND ONLY about the one guy you guys are hanging out w/ tomorrow so that you and your friends are convinced that even HE is the only one... understand... thats how things need to go because one INCLUDING YOU might accidently say the wrong thing and screw up the whole cheating process.
STEP 10: WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH PHYSICAL/EMOTIONAL CONTACT
Physical contact good... Emotional contact kewl... but when sex, or kissing becomes involved you MUST be careful of how they react. because wen stuf like that happens tha boy might be a little sensitive... a little more than you think... so you shouldn't make too much physical contact that might affect him emotionally and make him wish he had you more..
Thats pretty much all you need to stick by... If things are working without then congrats to you... I am so proud of you .. but for those who aren't doing good on cheating here are ways you could improve that!"

After we get out of therapy
For tha tests we had to take
For tha millions hours of homework
And making study guides
For tha thousands of wasted paper
That were thrown away last night
It is now time to relax
And take of all our shoes (as if we didn't already)
And run around in bikini's
And maybe even shower too!(I do everyday)
It is now summer time
In which there's no more tests
Summer camps, meeting cute guys
And we're always at our best
No more urly morning wake ups
No more 7-8 hour school days
Then going to practices or games after
To win ourselves an out of school day
I make this oath as a Mercy student
To say I WILL TAKE NO MORE
Because the school year is finally over 
And O-H Y-E-S I've thrown my books out tha door (not really im just sellin them next yr)
Oh yes, I'm a mercy girl
I follow every rule (yea right)
And now I get to see 
All tha cute guys that weren't at our school (the boys that were there were ewww)
Here is our oath to Mercy
How much we adore our school
Because at the end of finals
OH YES MERCY THEN RULES!"

"event","marcie if no one could explain it in such words as u have done; IF ANYBODY IS STUPID ENUFF TO NOT REALIZE THAT THIS IS AN EVERY YEAR EVENT AT MERCY THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT GOES ON AT THAT SCHOOL XCEPT OUR PSYCHOTIC FRIENDLINESS AND OUR PSYCHOPATHIC HELLOS AND OUR PSYCHOPATHETIC (THATS RIGHT.....PSYCHOPATHETIC) EXCUSE TO BE ""AWAKE"" IN THE MORNING. Anywayz here is Marcie's way of explaining our serious and exact Mercy sched.
TO ALL TAHT CARE:
We salute you stressed out high school students throughout your entire high school career. As you sit in your lonely cubical in the library, doped up on starbucks & aderol at least five times a week, you think to yourself, am I ever going to need to know this stuff in life? The distractions are tempting and you have already diagnosed yourself with ADD, along with advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage. I'm sure by now you know exactly what everyone is doing because you check your buddy list 800 times a night. The weekend is just days away, and your prozac prescription will be in tomorrow. So crack open an ice cold Bud Light the first day of summer break, because for most of us, this up-coming vacation will be spent in rehab.
-MARCIE (u rock my sox)"

60 things you shouldn't say to a guy during sex

1. I've smoked fatter joints than that. 

2. Ahh, it's cute. 

3. Who circumcised you? 

4. Why don't we just cuddle? 

5. You know they have surgery to fix that. 

6. It's more fun to look at. 

7. Make it dance. 

8. You know, there's a tower in Italy like that. 

9. Can I paint a smiley face on that? 

10. It looks like a night crawler. 

11. Wow, and your feet are so big. 

12. My last boyfriend was 4'' bigger.
 
13. It's ok, we'll work around it. 

14. Is this a mild or a spicy Slim Jim? 

15. Eww, there's an inch worm on your thigh. 

16. Will it squeak if I squeeze it? 

17. Oh no, a flash headache. 

18. (giggle and point)

21. Let me go get my tweezers. 

22. How sweet, you brought incense. 

23. This explains your car. 

24. You must be a growing boy. 

25. Maybe if we water it, it'll grow. 

26. Thanks, I needed a toothpick. 

27. Are you one of those pygmies? 

28. Have you ever thought of working in a sideshow?

35. What do you call this? 

36. But it still works, right? 

37. Damn, I hate baby-sitting. 

38. It looks so unused. 

39. Do you take steroids? 

40. I hear excessive masturbation shrinks it. 

41. Maybe it looks better in natural light. 

42. Why don't we skip right to the cigarettes?

51. Were you neutered? 

52. It's a good thing you have so many other talents. 

53. Does it come with an air pump? 

54. So this is why you're supposed to judge people on personality. 

55. Where are the puppet strings? 

56. Your big gun is more like a BB gun. 

57. Look, it fits my Barbie clothes.

"event","Okay as much as I love MY eminem... i love this song.. and well, guess what if any song I wanna have ""fun"" (per say) off of this is one of them.
[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go
Doing, doing, doing

I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go
Doing, doing, doing

The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to that new nelly jam, I
Think someones at the door
But I don't think I'm gonna answer
Police saying ""freeze""
Doing, doing, doing
What do you mean freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not till I'm finish peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer
I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee, pee, pee
Yes, I make r&b, I sing song it go
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd
If I offend I'm sorry, please, please forgive
For I am Triumph, the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I sing, you will love it

[Chorus]

Jessica Simpson, looks oh so temptin'
Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that
Everytime I see that show on MTV my pee pee goes
Doing, doing, doing

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they're getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my pop corn
Police saying ""freeze""
Doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put away my zip-reciept
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm pee wee herman, this movies PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh cuz that is a puppet on my hand

[Chorus]

Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee pee go
Doing, doing, doing

The way she moves she dances like a go-go
In that video she sings get out your poles, so
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze""
Doing, doing, doing
What do you mean freeze?
My computers would be seized and my keys to my ranch
I just baked cookies Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee, pee
On the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast, I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

[Chorus]

So Gwen Stefani, will you pee pee on me please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
Cuz the way you move it, you make my pee pee go
Doing, doing, doing

Fuck is wrong with you? (ha!)

(sum parts gotta be blanked out bcuz its too ewwwww to ya know ""have fun"" to."

"event","So wow... we watched Othello in English class and I just want to point out how that movie is like the most homo-erotic thing on the planet. Iago and Rodrigo kept touching each other and hugging and whenever they talked, their lips were about an inch apart. Plus they were all whispering seductively. I know that Malena knows what I'm talking about. See, I mention it to her and she doesn't really believe me, but two seconds after I say something Rodrigo goes and starts hugging Iago. That was a funny moment. The whole English class was pretty funny. Am I the only one who noticed this? If not, pay attention next time."

It was so gay because it was hard to get everyone's signatures. Plus I like to write page long messages so it limits the number of people I can write to. Now I can write really long things for everyone that matters. Except Malena. That bitch told me that I wasn't allowed to take up a page because it was a ""waste of space."" That hurt. I hope you're happy Malena. I'M JUST GOING TO SIGN MY NAME!!!!! So there."

"event","Once again, so much just sucks because everyone is falling apart. The six pack? Who knows. I think Malena is just blowing things out of proportion. Britanni gets an attitude sometimes but Malena doesn't pick fights with her. Let me tell you who picks the fights: Malena. Like on Friday. Her and Nicole were fighting and she ""left the six pack."" But today she can't even remember what she was bitching about. I cannot even count the times when Malena just has an attitude with me, Nicole, Janet or whoever. I don't even take her seriously because it happens so often and then she acts like it wasn't a big deal. Like if we stay mad at her for bitching at us it's our fault. Well, Nicole was still mad this morning and it's YOUR fault. If whatever happened on Friday wasn't important enough for you to even remember, then you shouldn't have made such a big deal about it in the first place. We deal with your attitude. Deal with hers."

I talked to him on the phone last night because we are supposedly friends. I mean, it was a funny conversation, but something wasn't there. That's how I knew that we could never actually be friends. He was funny, but I just didn't give a shit. He's my co-worker now. So there's a certain level of closeness that I feel to him, but it's nothing more than Isaiah or Kevin or any other of my co-workers. So yeah... cheers to what could have been."

"event","So I come home yesterday and my sister informs me that my mom is canceling my cell phone. I was like... ""Ummm... alright."" I guess she doesn't want to pay for it and she won't let me pay for it because it's a waste of money. Oh well. So I brought it to school for one last whatever. 

Speaking of cell phones. Britany Eaves got the funniest idea on the bus. She freakin called Tyler and left a message somewhere along the lines of, ""You fucking bastard what you did to johanna was bullshit you better call me back on this number or else you're dead. etc etc."" You guys know the drill. It was freakin hilarious. What was funnier is that she forgot to leave her number so she called him back and left another message saying, ""Hey fuckhead, by the way my number is... go fuck yourself."" Hahahaha. I'm going to tell him that I wasn't there and that I had no idea what's going on. 

Speaking of Tyler, he texts me yesterday and tells me that my mom left him an interesting voicemail. <i>Dear God</i> I don't even want to know. Except I do. Really badly. He said he was going to call me tonight. I hope she didn't embarass me to badly. 

I also want to give a shoutout to all my friends that helped me on Tuesday. I don't think you guys realized how every little thing you said/did brought a smile to my face and made me feel better. Some of you weren't even trying. I mean, I still like Tyler and I'm not exactly over him, but I'm okay. I know I will be okay and I like that feeling. As long as I got bitches like you, I don't need anyone else. I hope that if you are ever in a situation like me that I could comfort you guys as much as you did for me. 

Alicia: all your helpful suggestions. ""Well if he thinks you two are going to slow, then there is an obvious solution. Just go to him at work and straight-up flash him. It would be very professional and it'll definitely bring him back."" haha always helping me be the good employee.
Nicole: your random ass hugs
Margie: noticing that something was wrong
Malena: ""Well at least we can rule out another chick because you're way too hott."" haha. 
Britanni: All your logic. You made him seem so stupid haha. 
Alesia: just everything. 
Raisa: hahahaha, in ES when you were all like, ""This same thing happened on Alias..."" haha I was like ""wtf only you would say something like that."" and it made me laugh."

"event","Wow, last night was really random. Bad kinda random. Tyler asks me where he thinks we are going. So I tell him or whatever and then he says that he isn't sure where this is going and that he doesn't want to see me anymore. He says that we are taking things ""excruciatingly slow."" I was kinda like, ""Ummm... wtf."" I know what everyone is going to say, but I didn't really get that vibe from him. But who knows? Apparently I was completely clueless and didn't pick up on how platonic we were, so I wouldn't really know what he meant, would I? He said that we seemed more like people who He says that he still wants to be friends and talk to me (which is all we were, I suppose). I'm not really sure how I feel about that. I told him to call me in a few days. I don't really know. He also said that, everything about me is 16. There would be a reason for that. I am 16 and he knew that beforehand. He sure didn't mind it before. It was all just so... random. I mean, I guess we were taking thinkgs slow, but I didn't find it ""excruciating."" I kinda laughed to myself a little bit tho. See, I told Matt about me and Tyler a few days ago and he said, ""You gotta be kidding me. I mean, in all honesty, Tyler is not a very mature person. Actually, I think you are more mature than he is."" Those words were echoing in my mind while Tyler was giving me his explanation or whatever. I kinda laughed at the irony of it all. What were the chances of <i>him</i> being the less mature one? Still tho, I kinda have this sinking feeling in my chest because I liked him alot and even though we weren't together very long, I still took it seriously. I guess I know what he thinks of me now."

I was shopping with my mom and Tyler was there so I talked to him and it was good times.  Kevin got me in trouble because I supposedly talk to Tyler at work so much. He just told me that he would hate to be in a situation where ""I didn't get as many hours because I distracted other employees on the job."" I just kinda nodded. I mean, he wasn't being a jerk, but the situation was funny because I could tell he was teasing me. I wasn't even about to bring up how Kevin spends alot of time at the service desk talking to his girlfriend. Eh, I'm not sorry. 

Britanni, Margie, Nicole and I totally cured diabetes yesterday. We walked a whole 1.5 miles. Britanni saw a former ""love"" (a.k.a. assault victim). Margie was the only one to talk to him. Haha, we didn't get to see if he still had a unibrow."

But yeah, I don't think that my mom liked that the three of us (Elizabeth, her and I) left the party for 2 hours. I can't even remember why we left, but we ended up getting gas, going to BJs and getting chinese food. About an hour after we came home, the three of us went to pick up the pizza from wegmans. So yeah, I'm carrying the pizza and one thing and then another happen and half of the pizza ended up on the floor. Raisa and I just sat there and started laughing at the irony of it all. I was like, ""Are you freakin kidding me?"" It was a total Vala moment. We call my manager Jose over so he can clean it up, while Raisa and I try to make it look like we just happened to eat a few pieces. No such luck. So I call my mom and she's like, ""You dropped the pizza? You...dropped...the...pizza? HOW THE FUCK DID YOU DROP THE PIZZA?!"" Haha it was kinda funny. She told us to get home with what we had. We ended up getting another pizza and now there's way to much pizza. I'm going to be eating it for a long time. Other thing of the evening: making cookies and then my mom hid them behind the couch when my brother came inside. Haha. Watching the OC. Basketball game. Just good times.

I talked to both Sarah and Kristin today. I was hoping to get some perspective on the Aimee situation. I'm going to talk to her tomorrow. I'm not sure how she's going to react. She's unpredictable lately. So I have to think about what I'm going to say and (more importantly) how I'm going to say it. If it was any of my other friends, I would just sit back and let her get over it. But Aimee doesn't get over things. She doesn't think of solutions, only the problems.

"event","My brother's birthday party is on Saturday. 11 little versions of my brother. I've met some of his friends. They're okay, but when you get them all together, I'm sure they are going to be quite annoying. So I invited Raisa to come over and keep me from going insane. I realized afterwards that they are all going to hit on her, but oh well. We aren't going to chaperone them anyways. We'll just hang out and eat party food. Maybe watch some dvds. It's given me something to look forward too. 

Why do all my friends fall apart at the same time? It's like all life operates under this cycle of ups and downs. But the weird thing is that all the ups and all the downs seem to take place at the same time. Some people are easier to help then others. The strong ones are the easiest. They just need someone to be there and lean on. Maybe a laugh or distraction. 

The other ones are so much harder because they wait until everything... I mean everything... falls apart before they break. So then instead of a single problem, issue after issue prevents them from being happy again. They just want someone to solve everything for them. It's too much. If they don't know why they stay up all night crying, it's really hard for me to tell them why. Also, one problem creates another problem. So all I can do is help them deal with the little secondary problems because the real problems are just too big for someone else to solve. There comes a point where they have to help themselves. I noticed that with certain friends, they just make excuse after excuse of why they can't get something done. These excuses have solutions that are so simple that sometimes I get frustrated because they seem lazy at times. 

Alright I guess I'm done venting."

I got a zero on this earth science homework. It was pretty stupid because I worked for a long time doing it. I let Raisa copy like 3 of the questions during class and Ms. V caught her.

I almost started getting an attitude with Ms. V when she wanted me to read off my one answer.

The woman is like 90, so it's pretty serious. My mom told Alicia's sister that she was going to pick her up and take them both to the hospital. While Alicia was waiting for my mom, she just sat in her chair, wrung her hands and said, ""I gotta get to the hospital."" I had no idea how to help her.

After work, I called Alicia at the hospital. She said that her grandma is not going to last the night. I felt really terrible because she spent alot of time with her. She would spend the night at her house all the time. I told her that my phone would be on all night. She called me at 2:30 this morning to say that she died.

We did discover this really amazing vintage shop on park ave. and now we are gonna go there ever time I see her. 

Wed night- Evan had one of his gay friends over, so I asked mom is Tyler could come over. Her exact words were: ""I don't care."" It was so weird. She's so unpredictable sometimes, but I'm not complaining. Him and I actually got to chill for a decent period of time. 

Thurs- I can't remember. I guess it was nothing amazing. 

Yesterday- The whole fam went to Mrs. Esteban's house cause she had presents from Spain for us. She gave me an update on Miguel. Supposedly he's not doing so well in school. haha.

I kinda get why he doesn't want people to know. Here's an example. I was working with Ben and Meaghan (who's dating this 17 year old in dairy) and Ben just started teasin her:

Ben: ""So are you and Rob doing anything tonight?""
Meaghan: ""No that requires money which we have none.""
Ben: ""So you two are gonna take a shower? You know, make whoppee.""
Meaghan: ""Are you done yet?""

Britanni sang while Nessa, Nikki and I were her ""band"" with air instruments. I swear that we were one of the best acts. I'm not too bad at guitar as long as I'm not actually playing one. It just felt so natural to rock like that. It was way more natural for Britanni though. She was all scream-singing and working the ""crowd."" She's good at it. My little rocker.

I hung out with Tyler last night. He did the best thing ever. He told me that he had a present for me, so we went out to his car and he hands me fucking Godiva chocolate. I'm like, ""Oh shoot."" He wasn't sure if I liked chocolate, but he bought it anyways because all girls like chocolate. Good move. Anyone that knows me would know how I get with food.

When I got home, Evan was telling me about this episode of Malcom in the Middle where they ate 50 peeps. I'm like, ""You couldn't do that."" He's like, ""Yes I can."" So we walked down to Wegmans and bought the peeps. We walked back, and he's been shoving them down ever since. At first, he shoved a whole row in his mouth. It was really barbaric. After about 8, he said it was the worst idea he's ever had. So now he's on 29. This should be interesting.


[EDIT] He made it to 35 peeps in one sitting. I win. [/EDIT]"

"event","Tyler wanted to take me out after work tonight. So all I had to do was ask my mom. Well, first she gets into a fight with my brother about Kearney. So that put her in a bad mood. Then her and I had a fight about me hanging out with Mary Rose and the movies with Raisa. She's so psyco sometimes. I wasn't even about to ask her after that. Then after she had calmed down I was going to ask her then. She was watching 20/20 and then the reporter goes, ""And now we have a special report on the dangers of teenage dating."" I was like, ""Fuck, this is great timing."" I kinda laughed at the irony. My brother did too. I mean, you don't get better/worse timing than that.

I'm looking forward to the movies tomorrow.

Except the twist was that all of the women had to get like 10 men tested before they found the daddy. So that was funny in and of itself. Then my mom says the funniest thing I have ever heard. She just goes, ""All these people need to realize that life is not all about pussy."" I swear to God. I couldn't believe that she said pussy. 

Then today, Raisa, Margie and I were walking up the stairs with Malena behind us. There was this middle-schooler that was trying to get around Raisa, so Malena says, 

""Raisa, someone is trying to get around you.""
""What about a Jew?""

I'm in lab right now and as usual, I got extra time. My group is just so smart. I wish I had something to write about.

Let's see... work. Kevin is finally going to get me a step stool. I was helping him with displays yesterday and he kept laughing at me because I couldn't reach anything. I wouldn't ask him for help that much because that's not how I am, so he would just watch me struggle. Every once in awhile, he would be like ""Jump Jump!!"" or ""C'mon you can reach it."" It was kinda funny. My short stature is causing me difficulties. I also brought in a cd to listen to because if I have to watch Kevin sing along to ""Drop It Like It's Hott"" one more time I might go crazy. Granted, it's hilarious, but still. I brought in this ska/offspring mix and he didn't like it. He told me that he hoped my cd broke because it was giving him a headache. Good times."

"event","I'm happy but I'm not sure why. It seems like everything that I work for is coming together. Good times. I always feel so gay talking about my feelings especially when they are happy ones (no pun intended). But it's how I feel and I want the people in my life to know how fucking awesome they are. 

<center>Things That Make Me Happy Lately In No Order:

1. Tutor Quisar every Thursday. He's so bright and even though he's in 5th grade I could see us becoming friends. 

2. Helping Samantha with her homework because we end up cracking up.

3. How Alicia is probably the least selfish person in the world. She just does shit for people (myself including). It sucks that her mom thinks she is the most self-centered person, but she's not.

4. The New Nicole. I know it doesn't have anything to do with me, but I like seeing my friends happy. Like her new haircut, car, nosering and age just suit her. 

5. Britanni and Margie. Enough said. 

6. How Raisa keeps me amused in Earth Science with stories of her mother, busdriver and other stupid people in her life. 

7. My new conditioner hahaha. 

8. Malena and her dancing. It's so funny. Also, I like that she finally tells me shit. For example, I actually know about the Tony-drama. Yay me. 

9. That I don't feel like a complete loser for canceling the big orders. Haha, everytime they tell the story I start laughing. 

10. How Isaiah was one of those dot-com-start-up millionares but then his company crashed. I think that is the funniest thing in the world. Actually, just work in general. I know I write about it all the time but that's because it's good times. Michelle is working to get me a raise and Mike D. used me in some presentation because I'm such a good worker and Kevin finds me amusing because I'm always damaging merchandise. Also, even though Bob is leaving, he introduced me to his replacement as a ""Superstar"" (Let's just remember that he's gay so words like superstar are acceptable). In general it is positive times.

11. How my mom thought Ecko was a Chinese word and she asked Sing what it meant and he just looked at her. 

12. Sarah.

13. That my brother is going to Kearney next year so he's going to be on my bus. </center>"

Nicole got a car. It was so funny. Here's how it went:
<center>Her (as a key falls out of her card): ""Aww you got me a key to the van.""
Her mom: ""Yeah sure...okay.""</center>

haha she's such a blonde. It was so funny when she realized that she got her own car. She and everyone else just screamed and ran outside. It was like a fuckin stampede. Nicole didn't drive it though. I think she was nervous. 

We watched Fear Dot Com (which kinda made me nausous at certain parts. Britanni was cracking up at everything. ""OMG THIS IS THE PART WHERE SHE GETS BRUTALLY MURDERED HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.""), Dodgeball and DRC. Lauren was like reading the whole movie to us. I felt so stupid though because I laughed at a bunch of parts that no one else thought were funny in both Dodgeball and DRC. I guess that's just the way I am.   
 
Britney came over to my house for like a half hour while I changed out of my party clothes. Her and my brother got along QUITE well, hint hint hint. It was too freakin cute. He's offically going to Kearney now, so he's going to be on my bus every morning. This should be interesting. 

I got my permit. Big freakin deal. It doesn't even mean anything to me. I was kinda glad that I got it over with. Now I can legally drive with people who are over 21. Isn't that special? 

I found out that Mike (helping hands guy) is an 18 year old junior. hahahahahahaha, what a catch. I wonder what it feels like to spend more time in highschool than you have to."

Two of my co-workers bought condoms in my line. That was definitely weird. Like, I don't even know their last names. Anyways, back to Valentine's Day, Brennen has asked to be my Valentine.

I'm looking forward to my APs regardless. Sometimes I wonder if I always think about my future because I don't want to deal with the present. What's to deal with though? Sometimes I wish I had more in my life and not just alot of the same thing. Honestly, getting good grades has kinda lost it's effect on me. I look at a 96 and think ""Yep... whatever."" I know that's not fair on myself because I really make sure that I know everything all the time and I make sure that I do all my work.

No one does that... my parents don't know anything about me and i see them maybe an hour a week as we pass each other in the kitchen... and everyone else seems either not to care one way or the other or are scared to get onto me for some reason. He's not and i love him for it. 

P.S. I started throwin fulls on the floor today... granted i cant twist all the way.. but at least I was not scared to try. :)"

"event","went to sewanee this weekend to see michelle..
i swear that place is hogwarts (yes ive read harry potter) 
its one big castel with passages you could wind around in forever
the best part was the hidden spiral staircases and the dining hall was seriously EXACTLY like the one in HP.
really really long wooden tables with lights overhead.
its soooo pretty. its like ur in a different world up there. 
the people in the honor society have robes they can walk around in.
ive decided that i want to go to a school like that. Maybe not sewanee but something like it.
somewhere small where it feels magical to be. you think im kidding but its awesome. i want to go somewhere ridiculusly old.. maybe in the northeast where not everything is all new. i like the old feeling. yea this weekend was fun"

"event","THE FINAL INSPECTION 
 
The soldier stood and faced God, 
Which must always come to pass. 
He hoped his shoes were shining, 
Just as brightly as his brass. 

""Step forward now, you soldier, 
How shall I deal with you? 
Have you always turned the other cheek? 
To My Church have you been true?"" 

The soldier squared his shoulders and said, 
""No, Lord, I guess I ain't. 
Because those of us who carry guns, 
Can't always be a saint. 

I've had to work most Sundays, 
And at times my talk was tough. 
And sometimes I've been violent, 
Because the world is awfully rough. 

But, I never took a penny, 
That wasn't mine to keep... 
Though I worked a lot of overtime, 
When the bills got just too steep. 

And I never passed a cry for help, 
Though at times I shook with fear. 
And sometimes, God, forgive me, 
I've wept unmanly tears. 

I know I don't deserve a place, 
Among the people here. 
They never wanted me around, 
Except to calm their fears.  

If you've a place for me here, Lord, 
It needn't be so grand. 
I never expected or had too much, 
But if you don't, I'll understand."" 

There was a silence all around the throne, 
Where the saints had often trod. 
As the soldier waited quietly, 
For the judgment of his God. 

""Step forward now, you soldier, 
You've borne your burdens well. 
Walk peacefully on Heaven's streets, 
You've done your time in Hell."""

"event","You know those days that start out pretty good but one thing ruins it. Yea.. that was today.
This guy i work with is in a coma.. right when we were starting to become friends.
It all started about 3 weeks ago when he ripped his achilles at a softball game.. when he couldnt serve anymore bc he was on crutches he came to work with me.  
He ended up getting some STUPID doctor that put his foot in a cast and said to ""let it heal"" ... umm no that doesnt work
My dad and I TOLD him he needed to go to a specialist.. but he couldnt afford it.. no medical insurance
So he finally goes in for surgery this past wednesday at COOPER GREEN! are you kidding me? they didnt even use sterile tools so when he got home he went to sleep and didnt wake up.. now hes in a coma!
I hate stupid people.. how the FUCK did those IDIOTS become doctors?!?!"

I don't live that far away so ill be coming up here pretty often.. my name is edward by the way."" As if that wasnt enough.. i got off at 930 and was sittin by the bar tryin to find something to do and this 25 year old guy came over and was like hey how old are you? When i told him i was 16 he was like damn WE were hopin you were 18/19. Then one of his friends that was 21 came and sat by me and was like hey im brad. What are you doing after work? We talked for a few minutes because im not very good at bein mean and tellin people to fuck off so he ended up gettin my number. What else can you say besides yes when someone asks you if they can get ur number? No would be kinda weird.

It was sooo cold though. Anyways today michelle and i got up and layed out by her pool and swam for a few hours bc her dad FINALLY heated up the pool after we have been begging him for forever. haha oh yea for some reason i felt like doing a back flip off the diving board but the problem is im used to doing it on the ground so i didnt jump back far enough and almost smashed my face into the diving board... lol that was kinda scary. Oh something else i found out this weekend... on easter my cousins were making fun of me because i got stuck making the salad and called me a good sald tosser. Didn't see anything wrong with that but they kept looking at each other and laughin so i figured it meant something other than literal.. so yesterday i asked sean what it was and yea you dont wanna know. Seriosly.. wtf?!?! So i texted messaged my cousin to tell him that i figured out what they were laughin at me about and he thought that was hilarius."

Just because teenagers are supposed to be drama queens depressed and angry at the world doesnt mean we HAVE to fit that stereotype. Seriously.. since when are most of the people in here the ""norm"" anyways.. ib isnt exactly what the average everyday teen strives for. So why fit the profile of that pissed off sullen and dramatic ""average"" teen? I guess this is the last time ill write in this because Im just realizing how overly depressing people make their lives out to be. I mean my life isnt exactly picturesque.. but no ones is... so why bitch about it? if we all just get that everyones life is just as bad in one way or another as everyone elses then whose ""good"" life are we comparing ours to."

Basically what michelle and i found out is that we are suspended from ""allstars"" until June 4 but we can still go down to the gym to tumble as much as we want to (except during practice hours).. doesn't sound that bad right? wrong! also.. we can't try out with everyone else which means for the third year i will have to join in late and at all competitions everyone's parents have to go with them. Plus, now that the younger girl's moms know we are ""bad"" they are gonna spy on us and tell on us for every little thing. i swear moms of the younger girls are so fucking annoying!!! they told chad that we were DRUNK when we WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE to being drunk and that they saw michelle fall down the hallway! wtf?!? i was with her the whole time and she DID NOT fall! the different squads need to stay at different hotels when were out of town because this is so ridiculus! the worse part was chad was like out of all the people involved you dissapoint me the most becasue i KNOW u know better than this. I hate how people think that having a drink makes you the antichrist.. ITS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL! so now we are left to question whether we are gonna go back to cowboys or go to ace.. cowboys is what we are used to and we arent guaranteed to be on the same squad if we go to ace but i dunno. oh yea that reminds me chad was like by the way yall have to tell ur parents because otherwise it looks bad on me...i dunno what im gonna do with that one. so anyways after that we went over to dannys but by that time we werent really in the partyin mood so we stayed for a while and then went back to my house to watch the notebook.. omg that movie is soooo good! last night was the second time for me to watch it but i still cried anyways."

Friday was interesting to say the least... i rode there with britany and emily and lets just say i found out a lot.. lol. That night michelle got there around midnight and showed up with one of those luggage carts which we ended up pushing each other down the hallway as fast as we could until i almost ran her into the wall and she screamed sooo loud that the security guard came up and told us we had to go back to our room. A few minutes later sean came up and we had the biggest pillow fight in history.. lol we broke a lamp and needless to say our room was destroyed. lol the next day michelle and i got left and almost had to hitch hike to get to the world congress center but we ended up takin the subway. (whether that was the better choice we still dont know) well we got lost and ended up having to follow a family that was going to the circus. That night we did pretty good and were 7th out of 11. Yesterday we had to take the subway again and somehow managed to get lost a second time. Luckily there were some guys who were going to the same place we were so we followed them.lol im kinda glad we got lost though becasue they carried our bags all the way from the subway to where our team was meeting. Last night we did better and moved up one place to 6th which im pretty happy about. Five teams were able to beat us but at the same time we were able to beat 5 teams. its better than dead last which is what cowboys got last year and from what i hear it wasnt fun. haha two more weeks and i get to do it all over again.."

Oh yea that reminds me that em wont be in this competition thanks to her parents but its all good.. i dont think it really bothers her anymore.

"event","OMG ITS FINALLY OVER!!!! lol at practice today i found out just how desperate my ex boyfriend has become since we broke up and i don't think i have ever been happier.. not because hes gotten desperate but what he did this time has turned me off to him forever! ok so for the background.. we broke up on thanksgiving and his next gf was a freshman (hes 18.. hmm..?) anyways she ended up cheating on him.. which is absolutely hilarius on his part because you would think she would be like SCORE im dating an 18 yr old! lol. next he went on to this 20 yr old chunky girl from georgia (if you didnt know she was 20 you would think she was 12.. ask ashley)anyways while i was at danny's last night my squad was having senior night out which is just where the squad eats dinner together or watches a movie or something. Well they went, and im guessing she rode with him because after everything was over they went back to the gym to get her car but somehow ended up having sex in his car. ok.. NASTY! like seriously what the fuck!?!?! before i found out about last night no matter how hard i tried i always had the thought of us maybe getting back together in the back of my head but now i would not touch him with a ten foot pole!! YES!!! i can finally move on with life!!! haha and the funny thing is that i found out all of this through one of his best friends who came up to me and told me today.. she was like yea when he told me he was acting all pimp... lol but once he knew that everyone on the squad was talkin about it he was so embarrassed. I was thinking that maybe i should feel sorry for him because no one likes him anymore but then im like wait... he dragged me through hell and im sure he wasnt feeling sry for me while he was screwin that girl last night! oh how times have changed..."

"event","Well last night was interesting to say the least. Ashley went to practice at cowboys with me and then we headed over to danny's. lol she finally got to meet all the people from my squad that i have been talkin about for the past few months. Anyways, somehow the party that i supposedly organized turned into me not knowing half the people there but the night was fun anyways. Ashley and i left the party a couple of times bc we were having more fun driving and racing through the met parking lot (where ashley almost ran into me.. haha)Then we went and got john mark but i dont think he had much fun. Prolly the most random thing that happened was several of the people at the party decided to play strip tunk (from what i hear its kinda like strip poker)but while its not like i havent played it before ... i was not about to play it last night.. if you were there you would know why. haha anyways after the party chris ashley and i went back to her house and watched napolean dinamite.. did you know there is a wedding scene after the credits? ashley and i didnt but chris did lol. Chris left after that and i ended up spending the night there."

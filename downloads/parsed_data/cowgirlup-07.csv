"event","Thought this might brighten your day!

 


I'll be happy when... 

We convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another. Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, when we are able to go on a nice vacation or when we retire. The truth is there's no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when? Your life will always be filled with challenges. 

It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway. Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time with . and remember that time waits for no one. 

  
So, stop waiting . 
Until your car or home is paid off. 
Until you get a new car or home. 
Until your kids leave the house. 
Until you go back to school. 
Until you finish school. 
Until you lose 10 lbs. 
Until you gain 10 lbs. 
Until you get married. 
Until you get a divorce. 
Until you have kids. 
Until you retire. 
Until summer.. 
Until spring. 
Until winter. 
Until fall. 
Until you die. 

There is no better time than right now to be happy. Happiness is a journey, not a destination. So work like you don't need money, love like you've never been hurt, and, dance like no one's watching.


If you want to brighten someone's day, pass this on to someone special. 




I just did!"

"event","Life is awesome! I just thought i'd say that. Everything is going well... although my mother thinks I need counseling, something that has come up since yesterday afternoon when I got home from horse camp... and because i was so crabby and have been crabby, from lack of sleep and exhaustion... oh and dehydration... i've been really grumpy... so she thinks that I need counseling! However summer continues to be fantabulous. I love the weather... spending all day with my horse if I feel like it. Swim team! It's awesome. I hope everyone else is having as awesome of a summer as I am. Boys by the way... are no longer stupid i've gotten over that!"

"event","So a lot has happened lately and I think it's for the better! I've spent a lot of time just away from the world. Away from the influence of other people and what they want me to be. It's been good! I can really say I feel like i'm back on track. I'm sending a prayer out to everyone of you hoping that you're summer's going well and you're as content as I am. 

However content I am at the moment though is also being intruded upon by the fact that right now I am COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY OVERWHELMED WITH EVERYTHING!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! I'm going to die! Well not really, but anyways... I'm going to horse camp tomorrow and I was planning on packing after dinner and riding and I had it all planned out and then i got a call at 6:10 from the family I babysit for asking what time I was coming up and then I just got home at 10:15 and that whole four hours I was going to spend packing is now toast, and then I've gotta get up and go to church tomorrow and then go out to brunch with my grandparents afterwards, and church starts at nine so there's not very much that I can do before church, unless i get up ober early and i don't think i want to do that, since i'm going to be doing that at camp... so then brunch is going to last... well for a long time and then we have to go to Big R to get shavings for our horse stalls, because well it's just retarded... they're not going to provide us with shavings for our stalls, so we have to get them ourselves. So that's in East Wenatchee then we have to come home, and by that time i'll be lucky if it's not later than two o'clock, then we have to come home, hitch up the truck and trailer and I have to pack, the time in which i should be double-checking everything and relaxing I'm going to be going crazy and frantic trying to put everything together. Like I said I think I'm going to die!

Also I need some help everyone I got an email today from Nathan and it went something along this: ""The whole why thing never is easy is it? All the feelings are still there, after however long its been they don't want to go away. That and for some reason i cant quite pin down i want you to feel good about everything in your life, this part doesnt make a lot of sense to me so i dont know if it will to you either."" I need help guys I don't know what to think about this and what to do... I just need some imput... guys and girls... I don't understand and well I need help.. please!???! 

Hope everybody's summer's going great, hope that i'll see you all soon... Seth feel better soon!!!"

"event","So guys i'm afraid that I made a mistake. Actually i've made a lot of mistakes. Like with my grades. THey are horrible right know. But the mistake that I am talking about is with Nathan. I told myself that we couldn't get back together. Even though it's what my heart wanted, my head didn't and as a result I may have lost one of the best things that ever happened to me. Even though we didn't have a lot in common, and we got in disputes over a lot. I still loved him a lot. And i think that's what mattered. However when i let my head take over and pushed the feelings out of my heart. I got rid of the chance of anything ever happening again. Know when I see him with other girls. I try to let my head convince my heart that I don't care. But truth be told, I do care, I care more than anything in the world. And the problem is I think I still love him. I thought that I still loved him in a brotherly way. But truth be told. I don't know. Right know, no one take offense to this, I don't see a girl that's right for him. So i guess i'm lingering between loving him loving him and loving him as a brother. Some days i'm fine with it, most days i'm not. I don't know what to do, or were to go. Life is so confusing right know. 

Oh and everybody if you wouldn't mind. Please pray for my dad, he broke his collarbone and is having a hard time sitting still. And pray for patience for my mom and everyone in my family! Thanks guys."

"event","So over the past few weeks I have gone through a lot of drama so to speak. There was that whole thing with Zack and us going to prom and the fact that he liked me as a little bit more than a friend, and well now honestly I haven't talked to him in about two weeks and i'm kind of scared to talk to him again, sad as it seems. 

Then there's this whole thing with Seth and everything that happened their and i finally realized why I ""liked"" him and it was because when Nathan and I broke up I have gone through a time that's really lacking in the guy department like when you're dating someone their the person you tell a lot of your problems and just general information to in your life and I just missed that with guys and not necesarily just a confidant but just someone that you can talk to that's a guy. So I called Seth and talked to him about this and that was when I found out that he already had guessed half of it which was interesting. So I explained the other half of it to him. 

Then going back to this whole thing with Nathan two thursday's ago Nathan was going to talk to me about us getting back together, but before he was going to call we were both signed onto messenger and he sounded angry and i was already angry with him for basically everything under the sun and i said something that made him angry and caused him to change his mind on the whole thing and now he's dating Eanna. This pisses me off to no end. And I'm positive it's because i look at him in a brotherly way and the fact that he's more like a brother and that I love him as a brother, and the fact that i know him so well makes me realize that Eanna is not the right person for him. And she has a lot of things about her that he will not like when he get's to know her more. But I can't tell him this because he needs to figure it out on his own. And you know what if they work those issues out then more power to them because Nathan and I could never work our issues out. But I just don't think that their right for each other which frustrates me that their together.

Youth Group last night was really good, it makes me really sad that I didn't get to stay the whole time But I got to see Katelin and Kjersti. And I drove Kjersti home and she kept trying to confuse the people at Wendy's and at EZ's because we pulled in both drive-thrus and then she was going to moon an old guy in a Subaru but she didn't because her pants wouldn't come down and she fell over when she tried. And then she rolled down her window and hung her head out the window and waved whenever we passed a car. A semi driver honked quite a bit for her. And then shortly after that her mom drove by us. It was ABSOLUTELY hilarious. I don't think that i've laughed that hard in a long long time. 

I'm just hoping that the next few days and weeks will prove to be healing for me in all that i've gone through over the past month the lows and the few highs. 

A blessing from God: I got a new horse. His name is Robbie and he's a 16H registered Paint. He's so pretty and he's absolutely adorable, and friendly and a joy to ride. Yesterday though, because of the rain I hadn't had him out in like let's see 4 days and he bucked we we're doing long trotting because it builds stamina and muscle and it's good for them. And the goof ball started bucking and bucking and bucked like 5 times. I couldn't believe it. Then I had to get off and re-adjust my saddle and he reared on me and slipped over a little hill that was about 3 ft. tall. He was a total spaz. Then when he got the top off his enenrgy he was fine. So that's about all for now. Talk to you all soon!!!!!!!"

"event","SO I am really happy right know about pretty much everything. I'm getting a new horse, and i'm trying to get over Nathan, which is going okay I think but i'm not really sure. So i'm just kind of letting things happen as they happen, however certain people continue to annoy me and whenever i'm near Nathan and i so much as glance in there direction, this person will glare at me like it's her territory and i should buz off. But you know what she is 100% wrong and it pisses me off to think that she acts that way. It's so frustrating. 
I'm really excited about tomorrow because Charissa and I are going to Youth Group and we might go and we might not, but if we don't go we'll still go and hang out with Katelin, which will be loads and loads of fun, I like Katelin, she's cool. Then hmm. let's see what else is going on in life. Life is i guess pretty good. I'm really excited about this horse thing and the whole thing with Nathan has gotten a lot better, or so it seems. 
FAREWELL 7TH HEAVEN!!!!!
I'm so sad, family nights aren't the same any more, Monday nights were family nights, and every since i can remember, my family has sat down on Monday nights and spent that hour together watching 7TH HEAVEN. Know it will still be on, but it's reruns, It was really exciting though last night, I was so happy that Rose and Simon didn't get married and it was so exciting that Matt and Sara, And Lucy and Kevn, are having twins, and the fact that Mary and Carlos are back together and THEY are having twins as well. So i'm just really excited about that whole ending, but it's really frustrating, becuase Sandy walked in and Simon we need to talk, and then it ended, FOREVER!!! AHHH! Then after that Mom and I watch Everwood. And that was really good, but the series is almost ending, just for the year though, and this whole thing with Brite and Hannah has really gotten intense, and they showed a preview to something that is going to happen and something happens to Brite, and I don't know what it is because, well the episode hasn't happened yet but I can't wait to find out. I love Monday nights. *Sigh* Life is good! Thank You God!"

"event","So yeah I just found out that Vanessa thinks that I wrote that post on hers and so what if I did, I know coloring isn't a crime and its not flirting and i don't care what it is it's the intentions behind the coloring and i'm not stupid. She's been flirting with him a lot even when we were dating, he knows it to, but he says to not let it worry me because nothing is going to happen. and then there's this whole thing going on with us that's completely messing me up. My life is just crazy. I don't get why everything has to come at once and Vanessa if you read this you had NO RIGHT WHAT so ever to say what you did. That completely pissed me off."

"event","Life sucks you know I don't understand why everything in life has to be so complicated. Boys and life in general. It just frustrates me because i don't get why people do mean things to other people that are going through hard things and I don't understand why other girls flirt with your ex-boyfriend when you just broke up like three weeks ago and it's obvious that they still care about each other a lot! Then why they don't seem to care and just keep on doing it. I just don't get it. People just don't care about these things."

The peculiarity of the weather aside, it seems a new year has somehow come upon us again.  I didn't make much of Christmas before, nor have I made much of the new year.  It doesn't really matter, I don't think.  I used to remark on what year it 'would' be in my world if time were still flowing there.  It isn't, of course, so it's still 1889 there and it always will be until I return.  

If I am to make any resolutions for the new year, as is customary, I suppose I shall simply resolve to keep my same resolutions.  I didn't make them--not all of them, at least--at the new year, but that doesn't make them any less serious.  I shall, as ever, stand against my father and his organisation and their intentions--both here in the City and in my own city of London.  

I see no need at all to resolve to have Riff returned to me because that really is quite inevitable.  He will be returned to me.  I need make no resolution in that regard at all.

Or perhaps I should make an altogether new resolution.

I resolve that I shall bring to an end this war between my father and myself.  I have vowed before that I won't rest until the earth itself is baptised in either his blood or mine.  Perhaps I should resolve to keep that vow.  After all, I came quite close to it here in the City once before.  I know I shall be able to see to that once again.

Now, as to the weather: I certainly have seen summer weather in winter (and winter weather in summer).  It always puts me in mind of a time when a Prof. Wordsworth fell back into the City, quite badly wounded, and I was the one who had to hurry through a blizzard to him.  I suppose I think of it because of seeing him thereafter as the weather warmed again over the course of that week.  This is to say nothing, of course, of the other times it has snowed and thawed here overnight.  There were rumours of floods near the Cathedral on a few occasions and I do hope everyone has been minding the sheets of ice that were falling from the roof of the opera house.  That certainly has been a problem before.  They really can be quite dangerous when they fall.

I suppose I ought to try and enjoy the warmer weather.  I don't mind the cold, you know.  But it still seems a shame to squander milder weather when one is given it.  If nothing else, it is a way of sneering at the 'deities'.  We can enjoy one of their curses for a change, since it's a mild curse--if one can consider it a curse at all.  That is an ongoing debate, I know, but if it is a curse, it is better than some we've had of late.  Decembers sometimes rivals October for curses.  I think we've had the better ones this year.

I never did properly thank you for the Christmas dinner I so surprisingly found in the opera house kitchens on Christmas Day.  Please let me thank you for it now.  You have, it seems, quite the uncanny ability to know everything that goes on in the opera house and to better the whole of the place by what you know.

I think perhaps I will at least take a walk--in Xanadu again, perhaps, or out in the streets.  It is a holiday of sorts, after all.  And the weather is favourable for it.

There have, I suppose, been happier Christmases.  

Certainly, I've seen no small number of them--both here and in my own world.  And, yes, there have been happier ones than this in both places.  I'm not sure if there have been worse, though there have been more dangerous ones.  An outbreak of 'egg nog' hardly seems so bad as some ordeals that have come at Christmastime--there have been years in which Christmas has rivaled Hallowe'en, but not for some years now.  

But a lack of curses does not necessarily imply a pleasant Christmas itself.  I suppose Mr Stark's holiday celebration was as pleasant as anything that's come about at this time of year.  I should like to thank him for hosting that celebration.  It was quite splendid.

Or perhaps it's that I simply miss Christmas in my own world and all that goes with Christmas in my own world.  It was near to this time some years ago that I last found myself in my own world--not that it was at all near to Christmas in my world when I left the City.  I suppose I'll never be entirely comfortable with the idea that I can be here, and moving along day by day, and yet I can go back to precisely where I was before. It's like I've set a bookmark in my life, and I can return--or be returned to it, rather. And then I remember none of it once I'm back in my own world, so I could say that none of it matters at all--save that it does.  

I won't be having a Christmas dinner here this year, certainly.  I've not had time nor do I think I'm particularly in the mood for such.  Perhaps that's in keeping with the mood and nature of things at large.

Still, I suppose it should be said:

Happy Christmas.

<strike>I would wish as much to Merry if she were here or if I were in London--  
And Riff, I know, would say as much to me if--</strike>

Little as I like to say it, perhaps next year more than a few things can be put properly to rights.  

I shall take this bit of spare time for myself, then. I still have things to do--here and there.

I am terribly sorry to bother you, even like this.  I hope you'll excuse me, Father.  I've got quite good with these devices and I thought I'd send you another message because, well, it rather seems customary now when we come here and I can't find you that I do send you such a message.

I see that we've come to this town again, though I don't know where you are at the moment. I'm sure you're...attending to whatever business you have here.  I realise this must certainly relate to your work at the hospitals, since it does seem like this town is an asylum for the mad.  It's quite sad, the things that must have happened to these people.  

But, I only ask where you are because it has got quite dark and late now and I've not heard from anyone where you might be or when you might return.

Of course, I am still in the theatre where we always stay when we come here.  And I'll wait here for you, unless I should hear that you would have me do otherwise. I know you don't like for me to wander about, even in the gardens at home. So I'll wait here for you, as I should.

I do wish you might tell me why we're always coming to this town.  And why you've so often thought to bring me but not to bring Riff.  It's very troublesome without him, as I'm sure you know.  So why is it that we're forever visiting this town?  And why can't Riff come with us?  And why?--

I'm sorry.  I know it isn't my place to ask these things.  But it's all very queer, Father.

And you've never explained a bit to me and...

I'm sorry, Father.  I've spoken out of place again.

I should have known this curse will come upon us sooner or later this month: mistletoe growing from every corner and doorway.  I can hardly think of a better sign of the season in the City than this.  Truly, it is splendid.  And one must, of course, observe the custom of the mistletoe.  And the City shall, indeed, enforce that custom.

Yes, laugh at it for the moment, if you like, but it's never as amusing as one might expect.  It's tiresome and it's frustrating and I'm quite sure the Network will be full of apologies tomorrow.  But there's no stopping it, of course, as there's no stopping any of the curses--neither the growth of the plant itself nor the compulsions that come with it.  It's a wonder we're not all strangled or poisoned by the stuff by the end of the day.  And it is quite poisonous, you know.

It's sprouting from the ceiling and from the side of my desk at the moment.  I can fairly watch it growing.  I almost think I can hear it.  And, of course, it's in every archway and on every lintel and hanging from every lamppost.  So there's no avoiding it and its effects.  The City has seen to that very handily.

One could, in theory, avoid this curse, if one tried--if one were to keep indoors or avoid the mistletoe itself or others.  Of course, one could find a plant growing from one's hat, as has happened to me before, which can undo all of one's efforts.  

But I almost wonder if it's quite worth the effort.

I don't care.  I've things to which I must attend.  I've endured this curse and all the curses of this City long enough to begin to cease to care about any of them.  I'm going out anyway.

I will thank you not to try and throw me again.

This is utterly ridiculous.  Hurling these creatures--I suppose they're birds, since that's what everyone seems to be calling them--at pigs--which are about as bizarre--in towers made of little more than crates and boxes by means of catapults.  And all for the sake of what?  All I've noticed is that if one meets with success, one is rewarded with something of a halo of stars overhead.  As though such a thing is to be so sought after.

This whole ordeal is absurd.

And, meanwhile, the rest of us are trying to dodge these collapsing towers and these creatures of all sorts as they all come raining down from overhead.  One might give due consideration to the rest of us.  I know that halo of stars must so overwhelm you with desire, but do give the rest of us a thought before you crush us all.

I've never in the whole of my time in this City seen anything so absurd.

It seems so simple I almost wonder why I didn't think of it sooner.  But it came to me last night, just as I was about to fall asleep, almost like a vision.  It seems strange that I would have forgotten something like this, since the whole series of events seems so strange.

Granted, I shall need to plan further as to how to implement all of this, but to have something like this with me, certainly it's bound to be useful.  

And it would seem that I made it before, but that I somehow lost what I had made.

Still, I think I can recall well enough how one has to make this particular mixture.  Acorns, nightshade juice, a little heat to blend the two together, a place for it to dry again, and the rhyme together with the magic wand--

--except that I feel quite sure that I've never actually had a magic wand before.  

Nor do I think that I would be especially quick to use such a thing, even if I had one.  Nor am I particularly inclined to recite 'spells' over strange mixtures of herbs to induce some kind of magic in them.

And yet, that seems to have been precisely what I did.  And with nothing less than a 'magic wand'.  

It's a concoction designed to put one to sleep--whoever might ingest the concoction, of course, or come into close contact with it, which almost certainly has something to do with the fact that it involves nightshade, which is boiled and mixed with acorns, which apparently dilutes the strength of the nightshade, though that's a mixture I've yet to come across since.  There are several substances that can create such a state, and I shouldn't be too surprised to find nightshade in some of them, though it seems an odd choice for such a mixture.  But that's of no matter.  Of course I did have to make it that time before, since Merry and Riff--and perhaps Oscar, though I'm not sure, and little do I care--were put at peril.  And it seems that there was a monstrous beast involved--something like a lion or a leopard, though black and terrible.  So of course I set about to create this mixture, even thought he threat to them was not in the City, but at home.  I'm quite sure it was my father and that mad doctor who were involved, somehow.  Or someone from his nightmarish machinery of an organisation.  Only they would do such a thing.  At least I'd got word of it in the City.  

Foolish as it might sound, I meant to try and keep this mixture with me so I could carry it with me out of the City shortly thereafter.  And it was no easy task to make, either, since there was some risk of my falling asleep in the process of making it.

But it seems it was a risk I was willing to take--and twice over: first to make this substance and then to keep it with me in the hopes of returning home again very soon thereafter.

I'm quite sure I didn't dream this, somehow.  It's not as though I'm remembering a dream.  I'm simply remembering something that happened, though I can't recall when or where, nor especially much of why.

It surely wasn't the time that I sneaked into my father's secret rooms with Crehador's help.  I would have thought I might have used this mixture then, but I'm quite sure I didn't.  I know what I did then, and it was not this.

But a magic spell?  It's nothing less than that in my memory--I think it was even called that, and I didn't object.  Magic spells are absolute nonsense, so far as I and my world are concerned.  They're smoke and mirrors and piano wire.  But that is precisely what this was not, even if it was called the same, and I was quite certain it would work.  <strike>Was it during that time with Megumi when--That's surely the closest I can think that this can come--There's no sense to it at all--</strike>

If I were to create more of this same mixture and carry it with me now--I need to think further this time, further than I did the time before.  The risk in this procedure is still significant.  But to have a concoction like this with me, certainly I could use it against my enemies when I come upon them in whatever hole they've hidden themselves.  It could serve me well when I need to rescue Riff.  If I need must drug anyone set to watch him, that mad doctor, his assistant, or even my father, I certainly will.  I know I could myself fall into a death-like sleep, but there are any number of substances that can send one into such a state.

And I am certainly not afraid of those.  

Nor, do I think, I am afraid of magic.  In my world, it simply doesn't exist.  But perhaps the trick of it is that it's to be done in the City and carried out again.

I shall need three good-sized acorns.  Nightshade juice, I think I can find.

And surely there's a magic wand or two to be found in this City.

I have found no sign of you, though several doctors spoke of having seen you.  You do not appear to be at large in the City nor on the Network.  You are not running an errand on my behalf and you are not to be found in the house.  You have not departed for London--a situation, I could almost forgive, this City being what it is.  Nor have there been any particularly difficult curses of late which might account for some separation.  Nor are you being treated by the staff of the hospital, which could also account for your absence.

You are therefore behaving in a very poor way for someone in my service--especially you.

If I didn't know any better, I might begin to suspect some things.

I shall give you until midnight tonight to return.  You would be wise to return immediately.

<blockquote>The gardens have been brought indoors. This is the best that anyone can manage to say as they come into the cathedral on this summer morning.

Indeed, the gardens must have been destroyed, utterly ravaged for the sake of these roses in their prime, these irises, these white hydrangea like mounds of snow. The altar fairly groans under the offering of heaped flowers: cherry blossoms, apple blossoms, white roses, white lilies, white tulips--every flower and its marvelous name. Arched doorways are draped in garlands woven out of wisteria and lily of the valley. Pale columns, already twined in soft clouds of lilies or roses or pomegranates or cherubs (they're more or less Corinthian columns, but no one dares point that out in so many words) are draped again in long garlands and ribbons. Every arch, every point, every vault, every niche, every corner has seemingly sprouted flowers overnight. White marble, white ivory, white stone now glistens with green leaves and white flowers. Saints and angels of other times and other places wear crowns of flowers, bear wreaths in their hands, carry garlands of their own. And, touched with gold as gold will touch a garden on a summer morning, their halos and crowns and robes glitter bright with candles--needless candles for all the sunlight pouring through a thousand windows, and each one bright as thought set not with glass but with a dozen kinds of jewels, stacked sapphire and ruby over rose quartz and emerald, scattering fragments to turn white violets to red or blue. The gardens must be utterly destroyed in this kind of maniac sacrifice. There must be none left--

--save for one patch of flowers which, one must feel certain, were set aside to be carried by the one for which the entire cathedral attends: white roses and white lilies, wrapped in white ribbons, it must be.

The obligations of City and curse cannot be entirely undone, but the details, the agreements and payments have been made in such ways and in such complex cascades of sacrifice upon sacrifice that, although the weather is fine, the obligation is for a curse. And, hence, it should be little wonder than it is to the call of elfin trumpets and bells of strange and alien metals that this wedding should commence.

But, perhaps these elfin trumpets, these goblin offerings are not so strange. They are strangers, visitors for the day, but they have filled huge haliotis shells with pearls and laid them at the door to the church, they brought her emeralds for her to set to flash among the tresses of her long fair hair, they brought her threaded sapphires for her cloak: all this the princes of fable (who knew they would not have her) did and the elves and the gnomes of myth. For this was of the country from which she came, and so it was good. And partly she still lived, and partly she was one with long-ago and with those sacred tales that nurses tell, when all their children are good, and evening has come, and the fire is burning well, and the soft pat-pat of the snow-flakes on the pane is like the furtive tread of fearful things in old, enchanted woods.

The last darkness of the cathedral is lifted now, as the heavy doors are opened by unseen hands, and the brightness and the coolness of the day spills in and draws to it all the scents of the hyacinths and narcissus waiting before, draping languidly on caught clouds of silk or damask, lining the path to the altar--and with them the scent of one small monkshood flower.

She had only just stepped into the cathedral, white and ivory against still more white and ivory. Save for her hair: such a striking shade, golden, bright, shining, that impossible color that seems to vanish save in its own shine, and impossible to name, falling about her pale shoulders in tendrils and curls and waves. Her face, pale, like a rose petal itself, but marked with bright blue eyes--and their brightness shines even through the fog of her veil.

Her dress was white and it whispered, such soft fabric, and delicately striped in ivory and white--stripes just subtle enough to shimmer and vanish as she moved, so that anyone looking would find himself staring to see if he had seen what he had thought he'd seen. But, of course, he had. And, of course, that was far from the only thing a man would see about her. The clutch of roses, white but for the palest of pale pinks there at the calyx, pinned at the top of the bodice of her dress, and the angle of the stripes as the fabric was cut around the shape of her (so small, so delicate, more the shape of a bird than of a woman). The shape of her dress, how she rose through it, the drapes and folds and gathers of that same faintly striped fabric tossed all around behind her--as though perhaps she were a goddess, gathering up all her trailing glories and gown about her, an excess, an embarrassment of riches, pinned up and around her and draped to trail behind her, lace and silk and satin. The other clutch of roses, the with same palest of pale pinks at their base, pinned to her hair--and those pins doing nothing to keep it from tumbling around her shoulders as it pleased, and never mind it. What good it did was to keep up the veil that hung before her face and trailed behind her, like morning mist, like faintest clouds, like the finest breath of snow, yards upon yards upon yards of gossamer for the sake of gossamer, trailing longer than the train of her gown, spilling cataracts of itself nearly to the doors of the cathedral itself. Her veil might as well have been made of the flights of birds and her dress might as well have been made of those same swans' wings or feathers for the way it fit about her and behind her and around her, white and falling from her hips, with its myriad of pleats and tucks and folds and gathers so that it resembled nothing so much as the closed wings of a thousand white birds, gathered up and sleeping; or like the careful turret-building of mother-of-pearl to be found in a broken-open shell, stacked in chamber on chamber and row on row; white, like she was rising out of a fountain of water. The only darkness to her was the shadow of her hair and the shadow of her veil.

So, take these soft stripes that may not be stripes at all. Take this most delicate of lace. Take these palest of roses. Now, if you are a fairy princess, as you so seem, call the birds to fit them to you.

But despite the fragility of her--porcelain, rose petals, ivory, moonlight, dawn, and pearls--she was brave, and she was bold, with a voice that surprised everyone, and a spirit that stopped at nothing--a familiarity in that, hauntingly, as she, ghost-like in her veils, would walk the path two others had wanted in differing directions and she would arrive where both had wanted, despite those differences.

And here, now, as the eyes, the windows of a thousand faces turned to her, she would seek out only one pair belonging to the one shadow, the one darkness in the grandness of the cathedral before her, the one place where the scent of hemlock and hellebore and monkshood and belladonna could be found.</blockquote>

I have, in my time here in the City, seen some rather remarkably bizarre curses.  And, of course, one's definition of 'bizarre' can vary more than a little in such a place as this, and these 'bizarre' curses can, likewise, range from the nonsensical to the disturbing.  I have seen monstrous creatures, snow in summer, floods of gelatin--though I suppose this wasn't properly a curse, the City submerged underwater, the City transported to a sailing ship, the City transformed entirely to something out of the <u>Arabian Nights</u>, the Fountain spraying beer and the pipes of the City likewise filled with the stuff, and cake raining down from the sky.  And, in point of fact, as another example of a bizarre curse, I was a woman for the duration of the weekend--externally, of course.  I was still very much myself, all the same.

But in all my time here in the City, I had yet to see a curse such as this one today.

I had not hoped for toast and bread for breakfast, but it would appear that this is what I am to eat.  In fact, the butter and jam also seem to be made of bread.  And when I tried to take my tea, it <u>too</u> transformed into something more at purl than proper tea.  And I know Riff prepared <u>tea</u> for me.  But this makes it something like <u>liquid</u> bread.  It is distinctly disgusting.  Riff, I believe I will be foregoing my usual afternoon tea for the day, unfortunately.  You'll have to make it up to me tomorrow.

In fact, most everything seems to be transforming to bread the moment it's prepared.  The cats are eating bread today because there's nothing else to give them.  The cafe is full of nothing but bread.  The cakes are bread, the scones are bread, and the tea is bread, the coffee is bread.  Indeed, even the milk and sugar are bread.  It's nothing but bread.  I suppose the only thing that isn't turning to bread is bread itself, but I almost think the idea of bread transforming into bread is a little too mad for the City.

I suppose I ought to be grateful that I'm not turning into bread, that the buildings are not turning into bread, and that there are no flocks of suddenly ravenous birds circling the City.  This could be far worse than it is, I admit.  As it is, it's simply absurd.  It has yet to cross over into something truly horrifying or outrageous.  As it is, I think I can endure for the day.  And I shall be glad that the water coming from the pipes is not bread--save until one wishes to drink it.  It's not as though we've all been given a distinctly twisted version of King Midas's touch.  Really, I suppose it could be far worse, or far more appalling.  We can still eat and we won't turn ourselves or others to bread by accident.  We're just obliged to eat nothing but bread for a day and a night.  I can endure the specificity of this curse, I suppose, however infuriating it might be.

But may I remind the 'deities' that man does not live on bread alone?

<font size=-2>[Blink--and there's chaos for a moment, dark and light, a ceiling, a glimpse of fingers and a face. It takes a little while, but soon the image becomes clear: a young girl looking into a mirror on a dressing table and holding up her Network device to show herself to herself. She seems delicate and slightly built, wearing a man's white shirt unbuttoned at the throat, with her dark hair falling around her shoulders.  And some people may notice and recognize this girl's catlike green-gold-green eyes--familiar, if one knows them. But she has a peculiar air about her movements: like an actor in costume, playing the part of a woman--playing it well, so far as the face and figure goes, but not so well in certain gestures.  There's something not quite right, something slightly off. She studies herself in the mirror and in the Network device a moment before she speaks:]</font>

Well, it's been some time since the last time I was obliged to endure this particular curse.

<font size=-2>[So, truth be told, 'she' is not a she at all but a 'he'. He tugs at the skirt of his dress a little awkwardly.]</font>

Yes, I am still Cain Hargreaves, but much altered.

<font size=-2>[A rueful laugh.  It's rather charming.  If one will notice, all his gestures and mannerisms and expressions are the same, but transposed onto this different shape]</font>

Perhaps I ought to be glad I'm not a cat again, although I'm not quite certain that this is all that much better.

I won't deny it was as much a shock this time as the times before.  I'm only really accustomed to waking as a cat, not as a lady.  But I've had something of an easier time of it this morning.  

Although I'm never quite sure if I ought to wear a lady's things or my own.  I'd rather wear my own, so that I won't have to keep such things around in case of curses like this.  But Merry was delighted once to dress me up while I was a countess instead of an earl--although I'm not even sure if I should call myself 'countess' or not.  I am, after all, still very much myself, even in this different shape.  I won't be calling myself by a different name.

<font size=-2>[He looks at his face--both strange and familiar--in the mirror for a moment longer.  His expression darkens.]</font>

It would rather complete the illusion, though.  And I have wondered some, in the past, how my life would have been different if I'd been born as my father's daughter instead of his son.  I find myself wondering these things in particular during curses like this.  But I've never had such reason to consider these things before this particular revisitation of this curse.  

<font size=-2>[A pause.]</font>

But perhaps I ought not to dwell on such things.

<font size=-2>[He draws nearer to the mirror, gathers his hair away from his face, holds it behind his neck, out of the way, and examines his face more closely: rather remarkably like it was before, so far as these things go. Maybe the lips are a little rosier, the angles a little softer, but, really, not so different at all.  He and his usual self could so easily be twins.  Or, perhaps, he sees in his own face something of a lady he knew a very long time ago.  But the gravity and stillness in his gestures is soon broken: he gives a bit of a half smile and looks aside a moment, then back to the mirror, fluttering lashes, playing the coquette. It's all a game. He draws back and addresses the camera again:]</font>

Still, given such thoughts, I wanted to make a record of myself while I'm in this shape. It's a curiosity, really, and rather fascinating. So, yes, while I know the Network has been full of people shrieking over one curse or another today and the streets are filled with chaos as they so often are on such weekends, I'll simply put this entry alongside them, however calm it might seem.

Of course I was concerned, you know, when I first woke this morning. I could practically feel that I wasn't the right shape just with the way I felt in lying in bed. It was clear something was wrong--though I didn't yet know how wrong. Yes, I've quite got over my shock since. After all, I've better things to do than fret over yet another curse.  This is mild, so far as curses go.  I can speak as I please, I can move as I please.  I'm simply in another shape, and not a difficult or displeasing shape in the least.  And, really, it will be done with tonight or tomorrow night.

Cain Hargreaves, the Earl of Hargreaves still despite the inopportune return of his father both from the apparent cold hands of death and to the City, returned to his rooms in the Opera Abandoned and the City's Network late in the afternoon and in something of a foul mood.  

Not only had the City forced him through the customary and unpleasant ordeals of the week of Hallowe'en, from which he was still recovering, but the remains of those ordeals were affecting the whole of his household.  It seemed that his valet, the loyal Mr Riffael Raffit (known to the family as 'Riff'), was yet unwell from the injuries he had sustained during the attacks he had endured during that same week--attacks, it must be said, of which Lord Hargreaves himself was in no small part responsible.  For even as his own servant had transformed into a monstrous beast, so too did he himself transform into another and similar beast--his servant's form bespoke the wilds of hill and mountain while his own was that of creatures of society and of night.  Perhaps it is as the novelists say it is and those men who transform by moonlight into wolves and those creatures more akin to bats and who hunger for the blood of others must forever be at war.  Indeed, such a war was very much to be seen in the gilded and velvet-draped halls of the Opera Abandoned that week preceding Hallowe'en as Cain Hargreaves, vampire, battled against Riffael Raffit, werewolf.  And, in so doing, the fangs of the former most certainly did more than a little damage to the latter.  And Lord Hargreaves was more than a little unsettled at the damage that he himself had done to one so loyal to him, despite the fact that they were both quite mad from a curse.

However, of greater concern now was the fact that these wounds did not seem to be healing with sufficient speed to suit Lord Hargreaves (although, had those wounds healed instantaneously, that still would not have been quite fast enough to suit him).  Indeed, although it suited Lord Hargreaves quite well to brood over these events and his role in them, it was far worse to see that these wounds refused to heal and seemed to be draining the life and health out of his servant.  

Compounded with this, of course, was Riff's (as he was known to the family) own stubborn devotion to the duties of the household.  Lord Hargreaves found him quite unexpectedly out of bed and preparing the morning meal recently and doing while clearly under a great strain.  Lord Hargreaves was more than a little upset over such a discovery, though Riff responded as was common for him and insisted that his master spend no such time worrying over him.  It should come as no surprise that this insistence was ignored.  Indeed, Lord Hargreaves devoted greater time to such concern for his servant, especially in light of the fact that Riff had more than a little knowledge of medicine and should have been able to see to his wounds and well-being in a better manner than attempting to prepare cooked eggs for breakfast with only one functional arm.  Perhaps it was this sense of recklessness or disregard for his own health that frustrated and angered his master further.  It has been said that they two have a greater understanding of one another than is immediately apparent.  

Still, these recent events have taken their toll on the young master of the Hargreaves house, and so it should be little wonder than the minor frustrations of the cafe, errands, and the City's own streets should have put him in something of a foul mood upon his return to his rooms.

He was glad, at least, that he had not been somehow prevented from establishing his usual checks, guards, and screens around his Network entry, even if he was obliged to write the entire piece as something of a narration.

'How very tedious,' he remarked, and it was quite so.  But, very often, the curses of the day are tedious.  It could be said, indeed, that this is their nature: if they were not horrific or utterly nonsensical, they were tedious.  Most tedious to him, of course, were such curses as prevented him from speaking or writing as he pleased.  He would much prefer to spend another day as a cat than be forced to speak only in letters, in the form of a novel, or something like those dashing figures of imagined pirates.

So poor was his mood that he was far from even beginning to suggest a bonfire for the evening, despite the holiday and its tradition in his own world.  In past years, he'd made certain to organise or at least attend such a bonfire and sometimes with a Guy of his own, though his particular Guy was modeled after a person with whom he was intimately acquainted and who had, unfortunately and has so been noted, recently come back into the City.  

Still, it seemed a pity not to have a bonfire on the occasion, even if he was in no mood to hope for a bonfire.  It would perhaps have proven a welcome distraction from the troubles that so often plagued him.  And he could not but think of his sister, Merryweather, now safely returned to London, and how she had so enjoyed the bonfires and celebrations of years past in the City.  But perhaps it was best all around: Merry (as she was known to him) was safely returned to London (as he so dearly hoped he would also be in the near future, such a project was one less thing with which to concern himself, and he could and perhaps should devote more of his time and effort to the care of his own household and servant.  Indeed, it would hardly do to have Riff suffer any further, and if he must make this clear then he must make this clear, and better to do so with no celebrations or distractions to trouble him.  He had far too much to do himself, in regards to his father, his father's followers, and now with an ill servant.  No, this was far better, foul mood and all.

At the very least, he hoped, this month of November would be less trying than the previous month had been.

I suppose everyone's had enough of the City's smoke, mirrors, and piano wire to satisfy them for a little while.  And, really, that's what it all was, even if it was the City or the 'deities' behind it all, and pulling on those wires.  Perhaps they were a bit more invisible than the usual sorts of wires and perhaps the smoke was a bit thicker than one might have expected, but, like all the curses, it was nothing more than a trick.

I've been to any number of houses or places that were ostensibly 'haunted' by one creature or another--demons, ghosts, even vampires.  In every instance, these 'creatures' were all too human.  Honestly, Riff can vouch for it: I've even been known to wander in a cemetery or two in the dark of night.  I daresay it's almost my element.  I suppose that's why there's very little in my world that truly unnerves me and why even curses like yesterday's seem more like a conjurour's tricks than something of which to be really afraid.  

I've seen these sorts of things before.  And, yes, they can be startling at times--I won't deny that--but once one has seen these things done a few times, the wires start to appear.  Even in the case of curses, once one knows it is a curse, that's rather the same as seeing the spare dove hidden in a magician's sleeve or the mirrors used to deceive a willing but gullible audience.  I'll take yesterday's curse as a kind of entertainment for us all.  And I did find it a very good show.  So bravo for that, City.

I actually did manage to join in a duet on a piano that seemed to be playing by itself.  We made quite a good pair, this 'haunted' piano and I.  I thought we sounded quiet good.  Perhaps I should imagine that my partner was the ghost of a despairing young lady, since that was the sound of it.  It would make a for a good story.

Really, there's something somehow beautiful and melancholy about those sorts of abandoned houses, though.  They're in such rags, but they seem to suggest such former grandeur.  Some of the ones I passed by yesterday seemed so much like the houses of acquaintances I knew in London, but as though they'd long abandoned these same houses and left them to the weather and to time.  Perhaps it's morbid of me, but I do almost like seeing them, somehow.  It's rather like being reminded of one's own death, in a way.  It can push one forward.  

Besides that, I've almost missed seeing fog like that since I've been here.  It's not all that often that one sees it here.  It felt rather more like home than it has in ages to me.

Perhaps I'm speaking too soon, but this October hasn't seemed nearly so horrific as some in the past.  Perhaps we will escape this one more or less unscathed.

It seems I do this most every time that one of them appears or reappears in the City: I hear of the arrival, I send out a warning, and then I retreat into whatever sort of guarded place I can find.  I keep off the Network and I do nothing more than waste my time.

For instance, this past weekend, the sun did not rise.  Now, I have seen the sun fail to rise on several occasions in the City--there have been festivals and parties as a part of it and there have been ordeals like this most recent curse.  

In fact, I think I've seen that very curse that struck this past weekend before at least once.  But it's worth remarking on: there were any number of people throwing fire or electricity from their fingertips or bringing tables and chairs to life or lifting massive objects or flying without wings and then having to pay a penance for whatever it was that they'd done above their normal capabilities.  I'm quite sure I've seen that set of circumstances before, though I hope no one had to break his fingers in exchange for some supernatural ability.  I heard, during the earlier instance of this curse, that someone had to do just that.  

But that's hardly my point.  The very sun failed to rise, which says something about this place or those who claim to be in charge of its keeping, and I couldn't quite seem to make mention of it.  I know it was rather hard to miss that detail, that we were in the dark for two days, and the Network was full enough of remarks on it.  But if I grow too accustomed to how peculiar this place is, I wonder what that might really mean.  Perhaps I have finally gone mad when I don't think two days of uninterrupted darkness are worth mentioning, not when I have other concerns to occupy my mind.

It's rather pathetic of me to warn you away from someone and his accomplices and to vow that I'll stand against him, only to hide myself away again.  It's what I do with curses, of course.  But I don't think it works quite so well in this other instance.  

And shall I blame the City or myself?

I have errands to attend to and the cafe will want my seeing to it as well.

I did not think that I should need to make such a warning again so soon.  In fact, I never hoped that I should have to make one again at all.  But it seems that I must.

My father, Alexis Hargreaves, has come back into the City.

I suppose a number of you have already heard about my father to no end. You should know already that he's a madman and a monster and bent on the destruction of the world--or at least the use of the world to his own ends.  He rules over a secret society hidden in the shadows of London that was once dedicated to medicine and science though he now uses it for inhumane experiments and black magic.  He mixes superstition and knowledge and creates monsters from it. You've no idea the depths of his madness.

I hesitate to list the things that he has done in our world.  When I was a child, he faked his own death, perhaps to torment me, or perhaps just to set his plans in motion, and vanished for years. He reappeared when I was visiting the Butterfly Mansion--the Cromwell's house, and they're distant relatives of the Hargreaves family as well, though the connection isn't the clearest to me, but I feel certain it follows through Lord Cromwell himself. The murders at that house were my father's doing, though he never dirtied his hands.  

That's his way: he will conduct this orchestra of destruction, he will guide his marionettes around the stage, but he will forever keep himself in shadows.  He will forever be behind these deaths, these monstrosities, this anguish, but he will never deign to touch it himself.  He has done this over and over, though I've begun to connect the different horrors with which he is connected--the fires, the murders, the mysterious happenings, they all lead to him.

Do I need to list the things he's done even in the City, the times he was here before?  He poisoned any number of people with a very rare poison spread on doorknobs and keys.  He murdered more than a few people, he threatened those I know, he's captured and tormented people I've known, he kidnapped Riff at least twice and myself three times, and he was nearly the end of us.  

Now my father still seeks to kill me--or, if not me, then those around me. He lives to cause me anguish and pain. And he is bent on destroying the world, or at least bringing it to its knees in worship of him. I have declared war between us. He will never harm another person I know again.

He is dangerous--how can I make it any more clear?  He's beyond dangerous.

I warn you particularly now because I know that he's found me here in the City.  He has spoken to some of my acquaintances and I'm perhaps the foolish one for thinking I could remain quiet and unnoticed and thereby protect those I know as well.  It seems I cannot.  

Do not speak to him.  He will try to use you and it may cost you your very lives.  He can kill you in a thousand ways and never be caught for it.  He's nothing short of the devil himself.  

He has made himself known enough on the Network that he should be recognizable to most anyone.  And, if you know me, he should be easy to recognize him if you see him.  We resemble one another; it seems I am my father's son.

Accuse me of dramatics if you like, but unless you're quite certain you can stand against him, keep away from him.  <strike>I should never have dared to live as I have been living--I've put so many people in danger now--I should have kept them out of my shadow--</strike>  I will stand against him here as I swore I would in London.  He is new to the City yet and unfamiliar with it.  He will lack the connections he had in London and he has only that mad doctor I've warned you about before and that doctor's assistant to aid him--though he will try to rebuild those connections.  We have a moment now in which we can prepare to stand against him and we may yet win.  I will kill him here and condemn him to this place.

So I ask you, if you value your life, do not speak to him and do not speak to him of me.  This is my war with him and I will not have him draw in anyone else nor the City at large into either this war or his schemes.

Riff, he's come back.  He's back in the City.  Riff, where are you?  I need you here.

It isn't a curse, Riff, so don't ask me if it is.  He's well and truly here, not some phantom I'm seeing because of a curse, nor one of those visitors as he was before.  He's here because the 'deities' have dragged him into this place the same as they did you and I.  He's here, Riff.  He's well and truly here and the things he'll do now that he's--

He cannot be allowed to take one step.  He <u>cannot</u>.  He will not move, he will not breathe.  I will have him bleed enough to dye every street in the City red.  I'll kill him here, I'll condemn him to this place.  I nearly had him before, with a poison needle and everything, and him in that prison until he was tossed to his own freedom by those same 'deities'.  Crehador, the useless creature--he's not here to help this time.  And neither is Megumi, though I couldn't drag her through that filth again, nor would I want to.  No, this will need a new plan with new means.

He was here before, but ages ago.  I know you don't recall, but I do.  And now no one even knows of him anymore, Riff, besides you and I, and that doctor and his assistant.  Perhaps He-Who-Kills recalls him--he's the only one still here, I think.  He was just as monstrous here as he ever was in London, and perhaps worse when he could turn the curses to his benefit.  He gave me new marks in the time he was here before, Riff.  Do you understand?

He's already found his way to the Network and he already knows more than one would wish about the City.  He'll find that doctor again.  And who knows who else.  And that doctor knows of Rosella, to say nothing of anyone and everyone else I've crossed paths with here in the City.  How do we warn her?  How do we warn the whole of the City that a madman and a monster, worse than any they've ever reckoned with, is even now among them?  We could scarcely hold that doctor at bay, and now he has his 'leader' before him again.

Hide everything, Riff.  Screen everything on the Network.  We'll lock every door to the opera house again.  I'll send a message to Rosella and see if I can't somehow warn her and shield her as well.  And then there's everyone else--but how can I warn everyone else in the City without making myself known?  I need some better means.  If he doesn't know much of us, we can, perhaps, have time enough to make a plan.  Because we must have a plan if we're to stand against him, even in this place.  I don't want to wait for him to strike before we try to do something to stand against him.  I won't have him do as he pleases here, the way he always tried to do in London.

Riff, where are you?

Princess Rosella, 

if you've a moment today and you are not so terribly cursed, I should very much like to speak to you.  It is a matter of some gravity and seriousness.

"event","I think there need be nothing more said about the curse yesterday besides the painfully obvious observation that October has well and truly now come to the City.

The first two days weren't so objectionable--inasmuch as the onslaught of visitors is neither entirely enjoyable nor entirely wretched.  There are worse curses, as we have all seen.  It's more exhausting than anything to have to endure those tourists, though.  And, as I recall, it used to only happen for one day at a time.  To have to spread over two days is really almost more trying.  One would like to think it would make each day less trying, but it seems that it's simply two days that are just as exhausting.

Of course we had some peace in between that curse and the one yesterday.  That's hardly to last here.

I won't begin to speculate on the precise nature or meaning of the curse yesterday.  It didn't strike me, and for that I'm glad.  But I will say that I saw quite enough of it on the Network for my taste--and in the streets.  And I will say that it is very much in the mode of October in the City.  <strike>It may have been a curse, but I could name the poisons and compounds of poisons that would draw up the same symptoms--The bleeding, the vomiting, the spasms, the pains, it all corellates to one or another--Strychnine, or belladonna, or aconite or some new mixture of several touched with purer elements--</strike>  Still, it was a striking curse, I think--between people bleeding from their eyes and their mouths or perhaps their ears, or those who were so suddenly and violently ill, or those wandering about in delirium--it was something to see.  

And does it make matters easier or harder to know that it was only a curse?  It never seems to, though we tell one another that it does.

For those who have wondered why some of us view October with some concern, there is a perfect example for you.  We're never to have a peaceful October, I feel certain.  And it spoils a perfectly fine month.

Things will only get darker from here.

"event","I should have expected as much.  No sooner do we chase a peculiar lady who called herself the 'Mother Monster' and her apparent nemesis by the name of 'Captain Space' out of the City, but it seems that the tourists are back again today.  

It almost never fails, you know.  We endure some catastrophe in the City and, shortly thereafter, we are inundated with visitors.  It's almost as though it's some sort of necessary process to restore balance in the City.  I'm told that the Animal Trinity had recently concluded their work in the City when I arrived and, very shortly thereafter, I had my first such encounter with these sorts of tourists and visitors.

This time, I think I shall do as I so often said I would: I will keep to myself, well inside, away from the windows and the Network, and I tried as best I could to properly recover from this last week and all its madness.  These sorts of days are always very pleasant ones to stay indoors reading--even things read a dozen times over or more.  I shall, however, keep a close watch for Merry.  I haven't much hope or wish for anyone else from my world to pay me a call.  And I needn't watch for Riff this time, which is a mercy unto itself.

Although, there are yet others who seem to come into the City on days like this whom I should still like to see, even if I may not quite hope for it as I did with Riff and now with Merry so long ago and so often.  

So I think I shall engage in a little foolishness and put myself out on the Network and let myself be seen at the windows.  I feel quite certain that the usual clutch of girls is yet there, ready to scream up at me.  Maybe this time I'll toss a letter to them, or a flower or a handkerchief.  I think they'd be delighted at that.  

It's quite time I tried something a little different in all this madness.  And I've seen all of this more times that I think many have.  As I said, I wasn't here in the City for a week before it happened to me for the first time.

And, yes, exciting as it always is at first, I know I'll be quite exhausted after a few moments of it.  But these tourists certainly won't mind or care.  They really can be rather like insects in the way they can find their way into anywhere or anything.  

So I think I shall be a fool today and show my face after all.  But at least I'm quite aware of my own foolishness.  And perhaps there's something clever in that.

Welcome to the City, I suppose.

Though why anyone would visit the City, I shall never understand.

<font size=""-2"">[Blink, blink, flicker, flicker, swerve, swing, fumble, fumble--a view of red curtains, a chandelier, a floor in marble in a black and white check pattern, a pair of black shoes...there, now things are settling, and the device is brought up and around properly.  And, in front of the lens is a long, gilded mirror, before which Cain is standing, holding up the device so that it can see him and he can see it, all at once.  He appears to be in the fitting room of a clothing shop--albeit a somewhat unusual shop if the black and crystal chandelier overhead and the red velvet curtains all around him are any indication.  

And Cain is examining himself rather critically, stepping nearer to the mirror, farther away, turning to one side and the other...  And he is dressed in a <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/1003/icarus_suraki/mantle.jpg"">somewhat unusual jacket</a> over his usual shirt and tie and trousers.  His hat rests on a gilt chair behind him, along with his usual jacket and waistcoat.

Toying with one of the lapels of this new coat, at last, he speaks:]</font>

It's not quite my usual style, but I do rather like it.  You see, the mantle of it actually buttons into the lapels--<font size=""-2"">[he slides two fingers in between the mantle and the buttons on the lapel to prove it]</font>--which is rather interesting.  

<font size=""-2"">[He turns from side to side a bit again.]</font>

It looks a bit like my greatcoat, really, though it's smaller and more at the weight of one of my ordinary jackets.  Which means I may be able to get more use of it than I do my greatcoat. 

<font size=""-2"">[Casting a glance at his Network device--because, yes, he really is speaking to it and to the Network at large.  Because, honestly, there's no harm in showing off a little.]</font>

And, yes, I do know that it's black and that we've all just recovered from a view of the City in which everything was black or white or grey, but I've no objections to wearing black, even now.  It's to my taste.  And it rather suits my temperament.

Autumn really is creeping up on us now.  It wouldn't be a bad idea at all to have a few new things in one's wardrobe.  One often does have a few new things made for the new season where I come from.

Perhaps I will take this.

<font size=""-2"">[Click, blink.  And the feed goes dark.  But only for a moment.  An instant later, the Network device is swirled back around and up again, and there is Cain standing before the same mirror, though now dressed <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/1003/icarus_suraki/red_waistcoat.jpg"">somewhat differently</a> and looking more uncertain about this particular ensemble...

Regarding himself critically once again, he speaks to the Network--of course:]</font>

I must say that I was rather disappointed in this after I actually saw what it was because--I'm not sure if you can tell--the red waistcoat is sewn into the rest of it.  Or, rather, the whole thing is a waistcoat, and not separate pieces at all.  I had hoped it was a jacked and a waistcoat, but, no, it seems to be just a long waistcoat with a sort of false second waistcoat in the centre.

It makes me think of those stuffy paintings of ages past--of Marie Antoinette and her trailing entourage, especially.  It seems all the gentlemen in those paintings are wearing waistcoats that look more like proper jackets with their sleeves cut out.  I'm not so certain I like being reminded of them.

But it is a bit dashing too, I suppose.  I've met a few pirates in my time here and they seemed to wear things rather like this.

Now, what's rather curious about it is that it has a jacket to be worn over it--

<font size=""-2"">[He swings the device across to show two jackets hanging from gold hooks on the wall beside the mirror:]</font>

--rather like this--

<font size=""-2"">[And one is granted a closer view of <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/1003/icarus_suraki/short_jacketred.jpg"">this jacket</a>]</font>

--but I'm not at all certain that I could wear such a thing.  I've not yet tried it with the jacket for that very reason.  Though I am really being encouraged to do so.

<font size=""-2"">[He turns the camera back to himself]</font>

It's original, I shall say that much.  Especially with the jacket.  

And for those who have remarked to me that I wear entirely too much black, there's more than enough red here to satisfy most anyone, I should think.

Most anyone who's remarked that I wear too much black, at least.

And he seems to have been put into another <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/1003/icarus_suraki/buckle.jpg"">unusual jacket</a>.  He is not showing it off for himself.  But he is regarding it.  And toying with the buckles.]</font>

This one really isn't my style at all, but the young lady here in the shop rather insisted that I try it on.  The red waistcoat was mostly her idea as well, if you'd really like to know.

<font size=""-2"">[He looks down at it, regarding it.]</font>

It's clever, I suppose, the way it buckles across the front instead of buttoning.  

<font size=""-2"">[That's all he has to say, though]</font>

I've been told before I ought to dress in a way that's more 'modern'.  I suppose this rather covers that demand ideally.

Although it may be too modern.

I can't imagine I'd wear this very often at all, no matter how splendid anyone in this shop keeps telling me I look.  Riff would wonder about the buckles endlessly, I feel sure.  And that's not even beginning to address--

<font size=""-2"">[He lifts the wrist of the hand not holding the Network device.]</font>

--these, I don't know, I suppose they're ruffles.  I'm not at all certain about that.  If they were ordinary cuffs, I might not mind so much.  But these, clever as they might be, are not quite so appealing.

<font size=""-2"">[A small sigh, and he runs that same free hand through his hair.]</font>

Perhaps I'm being a little too vain.  I saw that jacket with the mantle in the window and I was rather taken by it.  The young ladies in the shop seem to have leapt on me with everything else.  I think I've indulged them, and my vanity, quite enough.  And I shall very likely not be taking this jacket with me.

<font size=""-2"">[He looks down and behind the device still in his hand as though to turn it off--but a last thought crosses his mind and he leans up again to speak to himself in the mirror:]</font>

"event","I've never seen anything like this at all.  Everything looks like a photograph--like a moving photograph or a film.  Nothing seems at all real, somehow.  It's almost like being in a fog, something that draws the colour out of everything.  But it's a thousand times worse than that.  It's almost difficult to describe--in a strange way, it seems a little like being blind or like I can't see properly.  Everything's gone to grey.  What a strange thing to have happen, to lose the colour in everything.  It's like it's all washed out, like paint or ink.

It's not a curse, obviously.  It's another invasion.  But what a bizarrely peaceful invasion by comparison--the very fact that I can watch the grey City from a window and say that proves it.  We're not running for shelter or arming ourselves--I don't think we'll need to make the opera house into a fortress again; not right away, at least.  Perhaps we should be arming ourselves and looking for shelter.  The 'Stewards' and the harpies and all the rest of the invaders we've come up against seemed set on our destruction, one way or another.  But this creature has just drained the City of colour--I say 'just' but it's hardly that mild--and seems content to rail at us for having 'stolen' her 'act', whatever that means, so long as she can claim the colour for herself.  I saw her roar by when I went out to have a look at the City today.  She doesn't seem concerned with us, exactly, even if she is angry with us for some reason.  She really only seems concerned with taking the colour out of things.  I won't begin to speculate as to how she managed it.

The 'deities' seem concerned enough too, turning up on the Network as they have, not that they've done anything.  And no surprise there, I suppose.  At least they're still here this time, which is something.  And sometimes when they're put out over these invasions or ordeals, they'll let slip some advice on what to do.  Since we're already this far into this mess, that may be our best chance.

Perhaps we should have crushed that egg when we first saw it over the Carousel--if we could have.  One has to wonder, given the creature that came out of it, if we could have managed that.  But maybe that was her weakest moment.

I suppose we'll have to see about setting things to rights, as usual.  I don't feel pity or sympathy for this City and its 'deities' and I don't take any enjoyment at the thought of having to rescue this place yet again.  

But if I'm to be trapped here, I should much prefer to have a little colour than none at all.  I'll take my pleasures where I can find them, even in a prison like this.  Even a prisoner can sometimes look up at the blue sky.

I don't care if it's a curse, I look stupid and I look insane, neither of which I should like to look like at all.  And I am not going out today at all.  Mild curse or not, this is so <i>stupid</i>.  I won't be seen like this.  I just won't.  I don't care that nothing else or worse is going on today.  I don't <i>care</i>.  I look like a fool, Riff.  An absolute fool.

Can you imagine what I'll look like when I'm dressed?  I'll look completely idiotic.  I'll look like...like some overly dramatic fop who dyed his hair purple for a lark and for the attention.  I'm disgusted and I'm appalled.  I won't be seen.

<font size=-2>((Another exasperated growl of a sigh.))</font>

It's not coming out, Riff!  My hair is <i>purple.</i>  That time it was turned orange it started to wash out soon enough.  I don't care if you don't remember that.  I certainly do.  But that was a prank, that wasn't a curse.  I'm not putting up with this for the whole day, Riff.  I won't look like a madman.  This is just so insulting.

One would have thought that someone on the Network would have made a mention of this happening sooner.  Or perhaps there would have been some sign in the water itself.  But, no, of course there wasn't.  There was no sign in either regard.  So of course I step out of the bath this morning with nothing less than purple hair.  

<font size=-2>((Picking up in intensity again...))</font>

I'm so absolutely sick of being kept indoors by one curse or another.  I'm absolutely sick of it.  Either I'm trapped indoors or I'm kept indoors or I'm obliged to keep indoors.  Mild curse or hideous one, I'm forever being shut up in here by one thing or another.  I'm so tired of being kept in.

<font size=-2>((Time for some sarcasm...))</font>

Yes, I do hope this is keeping that hideous Carousel spinning well for all my discomfort.  It's the only thing in this City that seems to have no difficulty with the curses.  And it and the Clock are the only things that have any good come of them at all.  One must certainly hope they're doing well while one is changed into the wrong shape, tossed about the City, made to suffer and bleed, or changed into strange colours.

Riff, why won't it wash out again?  I won't have purple hair, Riff.  I just won't!

"event","I always find after a curse like the one we endured yesterday that I look back at anything and everything I said on the Network and what I can recall saying in person, and I think I sound like an absolute madman.

Some, I'm sure, can quite understand, even now, what I was saying yesterday, in between the snatches of lines of poetry themselves.  But, when I look at it, I sound as though I've absolutely lost my wits.  Of course, at the time, it made perfect sense to me.  I knew exactly what I wanted to saw, how to say it, what it all meant, and how to understand it when it was said to me.  In fact, I thought I not only sounded sensible, but that I sounded rather good--if one can sound like that, I mean, by using all the right small-talk and everything.  One can sound like that, of course, since I certainly did in my own time and place.  And I've caught on to enough of the same sorts of things in the City, I should hope.  <strike>Though not to that degree, I hope--  Riff always did say my way of speaking was a little blunt and a little coarse--</strike>

And perhaps that's the real key the whole of it: to me, as I am now, everything I said and did yesterday seems as nonsensical as the things one does or says in a dream.  These things all make sense at the time while one is dreaming, but they make very little sense at all after one wakes up.

I suppose it's too much to hope for that the City might, actually, be a dream itself, after all.  After this long, I should have liked to have woken up.  I know of any number of people who've dreamed their way into the City, though I wasn't one.  I walked in, ages ago, and I walked out again, and then I walked in yet again, and I was quite awake all three times.

By my count, I walked back into the City a thousand days ago.  That was when I last saw London and first saw the City again.  I don't think I've lost my count in all that time--it's a bit like a prisoner marking the days of his sentence in scratches on the wall, and I have heard that I'm not the first or the only person here to keep such a count, though I've not used such a way.  So I've now spent a thousand days here, in the ways that I've chosen and in the ways that the City has chosen for me.  

By now--quite certainly by now--I ought not to think anything of it all, the curses and the City and all its trouble and speaking like a madman for a day.  I've spoken like an actor, like a poet, like a Frenchman, like a pirate in a storybook, like a sultan of the Orient, like a cat, like a crow, and now like something I'm not quite sure how to name.  At least I didn't have sense enough to know I couldn't speak as I pleased.  Merry always knew that I hated those curses most of all, when I was forced to speak nonsense or French and had no choice in the matter.  At least I was utterly lost to this curse as one is lost to a dream.  It all did make sense at the time.

No, perhaps one never quite grows completely accustomed to it all.

Still, I should like to thank everyone who came to the Turnabout Cafe yesterday and last night for the poetry reading--or 'happening', rather, as I think I insisted on it being called.  It was rather surprisingly successful for a thing announced on posters and handbills.  And, for all that the poetry and everything else that went on was, well, quite modern, I think it was all rather fascinating.  And I can think of worst things to have done while I was so cursed.

<font size=-2>[ooc: If I counted right--and I hope I did--it has been 1,000 days since Cain last saw London.  Not since he first arrived, but just since he last saw London (when he went home for a fortnight).  That's a long time, you know.  And a lot of curses.  Here's to another thousand~]</font>"

<font size=""-2"">[And of the most accidental sort, I'm afraid, since, after all the initial flickers and blinks of the camera, there doesn't seem to be a lot happening...  In full view is Cain, sitting in front of his larger Network device at his desk (and the view is almost certainly from this device's perspective), with the rest of his room at the opera house in the dimness behind him.  He sits before the device, looking almost bored, his chin in his hand, idly sifting through the Network...

...but something catches his interest, and he sits up a little, blinking out of his Network-induced stupor.  He appears to be reading something, casually and curiously at first...  But as he goes on, he leans in closer and closer and closer to the screen (and the camera).  A slow smile steals across his face, he glances of his shoulder to make certain his door is shut--yes, very much so.

He reads on, and his might as well be a mirror for what he's reading: his smile persists, one hand moves to cover his mouth, he glaces aside from time to time and then resumes reading.

After a long moment, he laughs, sharply and briefly, and leans back in his chair...and then leans back into whatever it is he's reading.

This goes on for no small amount of time, these patterns of furtive reading and amusement and fascination, perhaps changing only in those moments when his eyes narrow and his smile twists or he rolls his eyes in what seems to be outright disbelief and laughter.  

He is silent for a very long time, then, with his hands steepled in front of his mouth, absolutely rapt in whatever it is he's reading (one can make a guess).  He has, it seems reached the end of it, whereupon he drops back from his previously huddled vantage and drapes himself across his chair again, and declares with all the jaded and disappointed airs of the decadent aristocrat:]</font>

"event","My dear City,

So it's all letters, and only to be letters today, is it?

I've endured this once before, you know, and this is no strain on me whatsoever. In fact, I ought to welcome the rest of you to the ways in which things usually went in my world. It was all letters, and only letters, for anything and everything. So if the idea that curses are designed to make us miserable is true, I'm afraid the 'deities' have had better luck with some of the other curses.

And yet, at the same time, it reminds me of home, which makes me slightly melancholy. I had a friend who was ill and wrote to me nearly every day--and more when his spendthrift brother came back. He died, though that wasn't entirely unexpected. Oddly, his brother followed him shortly thereafter in a carriage accident. That's the way of the world, I suppose.

Not that that's a remarkable story.  It's only remarkable in the details: you see, the sickly brother was said to have finally taken his own life when poison was found in his cup.  But, knowing him as I did, I quite doubt that that would have been his own doing.  How more strange, then, that his elder brother, the one who died in the carriage accident, should have been heard to have been shouting that he had been poisoned even as his carriage tumbled from the road.

Now that, I suppose, really is the way of the world.

Really, I've been here for so long, I think I've been quite spoiled by the Network and electric lights and the conveniences and modernity of the City and so on. Much as I like letters and miss the mail, I almost fear that the Network may have quite ruined me for letters at home.

At least I can enjoy it for the day. As I said, it's no strain on me.

And there's no limit set by weight or the length of the paper today, which is even better--no need to call on anyone to try and frank a letter through, nor a pence to pay for the postage, nor any call to cross one's own writing.  I don't object in the least.

Hoping you are as well as one can be in a City so regularly beset by curses.

Yours sincerely,
Lord Cain Hargreaves

There is a moment of quiet before a voice begins--Cain's voice, though with a propriety about his tone and style that seems a little unusual for him, a little more formal than he often is:))</font>

My grandfather--that is to say, my father's father, and the earl before either him or me--was very fond of this next particular piece of music.  So fond, in fact, that it was played at his deathbed and his funeral, albeit on violin alone.  I've heard it a few times since then, and it will, I think, always remind me of his death and of that day, and of my uncle Neil.

The piece is 'Zigeunerweisen' or 'Gypsy Airs', Opus twenty, written by Spanish composer and virtuoso Pablo de Sarasate in 1878 for violin and orchestra.  'Zigeuner' means 'Gypsy' in German and the piece is inspired by the musical themes of the Gypsy people and folk dances of the eastern reaches of Europe, suggesting songs from a foreign land and and people who are free and live in harmony with the land and the sky, a tribe who love their freedom.  But, this is also why they suffer jealousy and persecution from others.  Some critics have argued that this work was created as a sort of flashy showpiece designed to demonstrate Sarasate's virtuosity and exemplary technique.  However, the appeal of this piece seems to go far beyond the mere technical skill required to play it and into the ideas and dreams we ordinary people carry about the wild freedom of the Gypsy people--which perhaps explains some of why my grandfather was so fond of it.

Here, then, is 'Zigeunerweisen'...

Namely, it would be one of Lord Cain C. Hargreaves (almost certainly immediately recognizable to his acquaintances) in the rather distinctly passionate embrace of an unfamiliar but handsome and fair-haired young man.  Not that Cain looks at all thrilled with the ordeal, given the expression on what can be seen of his face, and the way he seems to be trying to extricate himself from the embrace, and how he keeps trying to grab for his Network device (the one recording the whole scene, naturally).  To be more specific, it appears the two are engaged in a very long kiss...

And it persists.

Look, this has now gone on at least twice as long as it should have and shows few signs of stopping.  

Cain is still fighting--perhaps for air now, it really must be said.  And it is at this point, mercifully, that the other gentleman does release him (perhaps more slowly than would really be desirable, given the circumstances) and, with a less-embarrassed smile than one would hope, takes his leave and vanishes from the view of the Network device.  And, in so departing thereby also leaving Cain with the Network device still suspended in his hand and looking more than a little disheveled and put-out (his tie and collar are both a bit undone, to say nothing of his hair).

With the device still fixed on him, he stands there in the street for a moment to collect himself, as pedestrians pass him by and a few similar scenes go on in the distance with different couples and different victories.

There's little more that he can do at this point, really, besides give an exasperated sigh and turn back to the Network device (still recording) in his hand.  He turns away again as he turns it off, driving the image back into the dark with a flicker and a blink and--]</font>

Kassandra can't have gotten on Cain's device, nor Noir, and Cain generally says something before now if he's in such as a shape as would purr.

<i>There--he's stepped out of the room at last.  

Really, it pulls terribly when he goes too far, and then I have to trot along to catch up with him or he has to trot back to me and pick me up again.  But he's not very far at all, but far enough that he can't hear me...if I mind myself. And it's not pulling especially badly at the moment either, so.

That means, as per our agreement, he and I, that I've got this contraption to myself, at last. 

At least he recognized me when he woke up this morning and called me by name this time.  It has been a while since we last spoke, he and I, but it does him some credit to recognize me as he did.  It's a shame that there seem to be so few others like myself today.  It's just pandemonium out there today.  Well, little wonder, given the place.  It is the City.  We've seen enough days like this before.  He'll keep to himself, complain about the curses, and probably pine over one thing or another until the curse ends.  He's perfectly impossible during curses, really.  He does try to keep up something of a brave face, but he's really impossible.  If you want proof, you need only ask Riff.  I ought to try and talk a little sense into him.  He might listen to me.  It's just becoming tiresome to have him lock himself up every time there's a curse.  It is the nature of the place and he ought to have grown accustomed to it all by now.

Or, perhaps I ought to speak to Riff, if I can.  If I can't talk sense into him, Riff certainly can.

He does try, though, you know.  He really does try.  The day after a curse, he always tries to straighten himself out again and undo any damage done on the Network.  It doesn't usually work, but he can hardly be expected to do otherwise.  I suppose I sympathise.  I'm quite wont to try and keep myself in decent shape, despite all the damage done to me over the years--and not so many years, at that.

I've told him before, with the curses and without the obligations of society, he really does become something of a hermit.  It's absolutely dreadful.  I never knew him to keep to himself to horribly much at home.  

Well, he is so lacking--</i>

"event","I woke up this morning, cold.  And no surprise at that.  So it's snowing in midsummer again.

Even if it snows every summer, it is still something to remark upon.  And, somehow, every time it's snowed in the summer, something strange or remarkable has come with it.  There have been curses and plays and unexpected returns and sudden departures and unwanted gifts and any number of things that always seem to come with this annual change in the weather.  And it is annual.  So far as I'm concerned, it's only a matter of <u>when</u> it happens more than if it will happen.

Anyway, I don't mind it in the slightest, not after the heat of summer for weeks upon weeks.  I prefer cold weather; it suits me more.

But I think it's bound to be a full snowstorm soon.  It always gets worse when it snows in the summer here--and yes, I know how perfectly mad that sounds.  But every other summer snowfall, as I recall, have become absolute snowstorms at their peak.  I've never seen snow fall that thick and hard before.

I do like it, in the strange way. It reminds me of the winter, when the opera house is dim even at noon and the snow shadows all the windows. It's quiet and feels all day like evening.  It seems more 'abandoned' than ever here. The first time I woke to it, that first year I was here, it was positively astonishing. I thought I'd wandered somewhere else, somewhere out of the City--perhaps even home--but it was only the City itself playing tricks again. And going out in it was a welcome change from summer's heat.  How could I not go out?  Albeit with one hand on my hat, since I know there's more than a few people who'd like to take it off with a snowball. The City is just so instantly transformed in a summer snow like this. Should we count this as a curse yet or not? I can't be certain. If it turns colder and harsher, as I'm sure it will, I suppose we'll call it a curse. People are acting more like it's a celebration for the moment, rushing out into the snow.

The light stays in the sky as late as it would if the weather were hot, which makes the whole snowy scene somewhat eerie. The angles of the light are like a summer evening, and yet it looks like the dead of winter. It's disconcerting. The seasons are inverted. Still, the City looks like a wonder, and Xanadu especially. Some of the flowers seem preserved in glass the way the ice has coated them. Trees are in full leaf, but covered in snow--and some of those branches are breaking under the weight of it. And every last bloom on the cherry tree seems to have been crystalised. I wonder how many more branches will break and how many blooms will wither before the heat of summer returns. And when all this snow does melt, what a flood we'll have to endure--and ice sliding from the roofs again.

For now, though, Riff, where's my topcoat?  It's in my closet somewhere.  We put it away for the summer, foolishly.  I should have expected to need it yet.  And, if you've not found it already, there's a coat for you here as well.  I mean to take one walk in the weather, at least.

By tomorrow, perhaps by tonight, we'll see this become a proper storm.  I can almost promise it.  If we are to go out in it, today is the day to do it.  It is a curse, and it doesn't feel malevolent yet, but I'm all but certain the winds will howl very soon.  The stories always say it's a dark and stormy night, but perhaps the snow is more frightening--something quiet and soft and white can turn on one.

Unlike a few days ago, when taking tea was quite impossible, I think I will want for tea after, Riff.  And tomorrow, too, if the snowstorm I suspect does arrive.  I think then I shall live on nothing but tea.

We'll see what the weather does tomorrow.

"event","If anyone has spoken to Riff on the Network yet today, I think it should be plain to you the sort of state of my household today.  We are not, as it were, completely grounded.

Nor is much of the rest of the City, for that matter.  I can guess that from both the Network and from a glance outside.  There's any number of things and people floating about.  Some really are going quite high.  I don't think it'll be a pleasant matter for them when midnight comes.

Perhaps the strangest part of it all--aside from the obvious, of course--has been the sight of massive--I'm not even certain what to call them--globules, I suppose, of water drifting along in the air.  I suppose they've floated up from the sea or from one of the lakes and are now drifting on the wind.  I've heard tell there are even fish in a few of them.  Rosella, I hope Ellington has kept himself well below the surface, in case there's water rising up from his pond as well.

For my part, it looks as though the ceiling is enough to stop me.  I've been up here for the better part of the day, in one room or another.  I've found that I can pull myself along by corners and doorways, but if one swims through the air a bit, I've also found that one can move along a little rather than just hang in the air.  I've not gone too far afield in the opera house yet, but it might be rather exciting to drift around some of the real heights of the opera house--up around the chandeliers, for instance.  Though I don't think I shall be going outside--I've already mentioned seeing a few people going up quite high and I don't think I'd like to join them.

Although, I suppose if one had some kind of a tether, one could tie it to something secure, float to the end of one's tether, and then draw oneself back down to safety again.  I wonder if that might work--or, rather, I wonder if I'd even dare to try it.  It would be a way of flying out in the sky, so long as the rope didn't break.

For the moment, though, I'm quite indoors.  Some of the furniture seems to have accompanied me up here as well, which is fortunate, I suppose.  At the moment, a chair and a table have both come up to join me--and I managed to reach my Network device, too, obviously.  I've fairly wrapped myself around the chair to keep myself in, though perhaps that's a foolish thing to do.  If the chair takes to floating about, I will have to go with it.  I'm all right for now.  

I almost think I should have suspected something was going on last night when I kept dreaming of both falling and flying.  I'm quite sure I was already floating above my bed by then.  It was more of a shock upon waking, and I won't say anything about trying to dress this morning--it was managed, but not without difficulty.

Really, this whole things seems like it ought to be pleasant, though the difficulties of it are far greater than one might imagine.

But, perhaps it's a bit like being a cloud, all this drifting about on the wind.

Riff, I'm not sure that afternoon tea on the ceiling is entirely appropriate--to say nothing of the difficulty that might come in trying to make it.  

Perhaps we ought to forgo it for today.

I've no cause to feel lonely in the least--not with both Riff and Merry in the City with me at last.  It's what I wanted for weeks and months, when I really was feeling alone and had every reason to feel alone.  

But, of course, for reasons unknown, I'd rather feel as though I'm alone today, when I certainly am not, than when I actually was nearer on to being alone.

It's a foolish thing to feel as though one is alone in a city.  Indeed, one is about as far from being truly alone in a city as one can be.  This is why everyone flees to the countryside from time to time: to be alone, and to have the peace and quiet that comes with being alone.

Yes, I do know that one can feel quite alone upon arriving in a city by oneself.  I certainly felt as though I was alone at first when I first came into the City.  But, it wasn't as though it was abandoned.  Indeed, from that moment on, I was surrounded by others--both friend and foe--and I think I have yet to be truly alone since.  One really can't afford to be alone in the City, not when the Clock's perpetual ticking is bound to catch up with one sooner or later.  There's a price for being alone in the City.  One can hardly afford to be alone at all.

So why--indeed, how--one should ever feel lonely in this place is quite beyond me.  And yet, I do still feel it, no matter how ridiculous it all is.  

I wonder about my uncle Neil sometimes--and all my other aunts and uncles, even as vicious as they are.  And I wonder about my acquaintances from London, too, of course, and my household, and the people who know my name.  I sometimes wonder about all the gossiping ladies at this party or that ball--they knew my name, even if I didn't care to know theirs.  But I do think of them, and their gentlemen callers, and all of their acquaintances.  No, I wasn't fond of Society all the time, but it was something and carried along more than a few people to speak to, and I find myself thinking of them.  Everyone I've met, in one circumstance or another, I find myself thinking of them of late.  Even that suspicious medium and perhaps even Oscar might cross my mind from time to time.  And I've met any number of people here in the City over my time here, but so many of them have come and gone again.  If they have returned to the City, as often as not, they don't recall anything of it, so it's as if we never met at all.  So I suppose I wonder about them as well.  And all those who have died--like the Lady Lailis from so many years ago.  I've met scores of people, spoken with dozens and perhaps even hundreds, laid eyes on perhaps thousands both here and in London.  

And, yes, as <u>ever</u>, I've Riff and Merry by my side, as they should be, as we should be.  The very thing I wanted while all else was going on I now have.

It's not as though I'm reminiscing about these things, it's as though I'm wanting for these people, somehow--as though I should like for them to be here.

I shouldn't want for acquaintances or companionship.  And yet, still, I do.

The worst of it is that I end the day wanting tea after not having managed to have even a cup of it after all of that.  All of that tea in front of me all day, enough that I ought to be quite sick of it, and I only managed to take a drop of it, and all I want is for a proper cup of it.

At least I did manage to have a little tea--that's more than Alice ever did. And, no, you needn't laugh at my knowing that, really. My sister is rather fond of the book. But, really, who wouldn't be intrigued by a children's book that seems to be full of madness? I believe I told this same story the last time this curse came around, but I knew a young woman who was almost obsessed with that same book. The guest rooms in her father's house were each called after a character, and one of her dearest friends was named Alice. Although, really, this young lady was more of the Queen of Hearts than anything. It is a shame what happened in that house, but Alice, I think, did well for herself after. Alice does go home at the end of the story, of course.

Anyway, the City's tea isn't too wretched, though Riff's is infinitely better.  And I've had a cup of proper tea now, the kind Riff makes, and am feeling much more like myself--the intervening day has helped my mood a bit too, I think.  There's often a calm at the start of each month, and I certainly don't object to it.

Although, as I think about it, the last time that curse visited the City, I was obliged to wear a peculiar hat--indeed, I was obliged to wear an entire outfit that I thought was ridiculous.  At least I was spared that ordeal this time.

And all of that, of course, is to say nothing of what I've endured today.  I have been struck, pummeled, and punched for the better part of the day.  Riff, I shall be bruised all over if you don't tend to these wounds.  I shall need something cold for them to draw the swelling out and I think I'll still be bruised come tomorrow.  And I'm going to be keeping indoors yet again for the rest of the day, if I can.

I'd call it a curse, save that the 'deities' seem to have been about on the Network more than they usually are and they've threatened a punishment for all of us.  Anyway, given everything else that's been on the Network of late, how can one not see such a connection?  

First we hear that someone has not only burst into the offices of the 'deities' but he has also launched an attack at them and had that attack meet with what can only be called success.  Yes, I find it as difficult to believe as I suppose everyone else does, that someone could actually manage to do such a thing--that someone would even try such a thing.  But it seems to have come to pass--and it seems we're all to know this better by the punishment they send down.

Riff, I really will bruise if you don't tend to these wounds.

Greetings from camp, I suppose.  At least I'm given the liberty of writing you a letter to tell you something about this place.  I must say, I'm rather surprised.  I suppose they've decided, as old as I am, it would do them little good to stop me.  At least--and it is at the very least--I'm among the eldest here, under the leaders, which affords me a little freedom.

Uncle Neil, we really must discuss my being here at all.  Rather, we must discuss your having sent me here.  This is hardly the sort of situation I should like to find myself--indeed, it's hardly the sort of situation I should be in at all.

This is not at all my idea of a 'pleasant summer', you know, no matter how you might have described it.  A 'pleasant summer', so far as I'm concerned, would let me enjoy both the weather and the sights in town, not out here in the countryside where nothing ever happens.  You made any number of excuses to me about getting fresh air and exercise, but I believe I managed to get plenty of both in nearly every summer before you had me sent away here.  A 'pleasant summer' certainly wouldn't involve my being made to walk around in the woods in the heat for hours on end.  I will very happily wander any number of woods and forests and fields, as you know, but I would much prefer to do so at my own leisure and in my own choosing.  I don't see at all how being made to walk around on this trail or that path is somehow improving to the summer.  

Nor do I especially see what good rowing boats, putting up tents, wasting an afternoon trying to catch fish, or carving useless things out of wood could do for the sake of a 'pleasant summer'.  Really, there's not a bit here that seems at all 'pleasant', save for the fact that every day that passes is one day less that I shall have to remain here.  

If this was to be 'pleasant', I think the only one finding it pleasant at all it must be you.  Perhaps this was your plan all along.  And here I've fallen into it headlong.

I'm not sure if this is better or worse than those boarding schools you're forever threatening me with.

I believe we're to be marched about again this afternoon and set to building shelters in the woods out of saplings and pine branches, as though we're lost in the wilderness.  Of all the many and numerous varieties of shelters I've been in this summer, I do think I like houses best and I shall look forward to living in one again, as a civilized human being.

And I think we're supposed to go out wandering in the dark tonight as well to set up traps in the woods--for moles, I think.  And I learned yesterday how to catch a mouse with a jar of water covered by a slip of slit paper and baited with a little food hanging from a string.  Won't the maids be delighted by that when I bring that trick home?

You know, Uncle Neil, I wouldn't be surprised if we're to stay in those same shelters tonight to watch over the traps.  

If I do manage to catch a mole, I shall be certain to send you the pelt as a trophy.  I think it would put every collection of pads and brushes on every club and parlour wall to absolute shame.

Looking forward to hearing from you very soon--

Your nephew,
Cain

Cain's face almost in profile, the back of his shirt and waistcoat, and a glimpse of his hip can be seen from this angle.  His room in the opera house is before him and before the camera, but he doesn't seem to be paying attention to it.

"event","Is it really so much to ask that one might be left alone for a moment or two?  Not only that, is it really so much to ask that one might be left alone for a moment or two by such people as seem to be completely out of their minds?

I realise that this is rather a large request for the City, given how many people do seem to be completely out of their minds.  But I think there are more of them than usual today--obviously, it's a curse, given how many have so suddenly appeared.

At least they seem to be mostly harmless, even if they are persistent and bizarre.  I think I've honestly seen madmen with more subtlety than this.  I'd say that they were dancing, but it seems almost like they're marionettes under the control of a very strange puppet-master.

And, yes, of course, the irony of that entire observation is not lost of me, especially since I know I am just as likely to be cursed myself in the next day or two.

I do wish that they'd stop pretending to creep up on me.  I really can see them quite easily.  It's not very effective, if they're trying to be crafty.  It's rather like a bit of very bad acting or something out of a pantomime.

At least we had a few days of what passes for peace and quiet here after that week of apparent wandering from place to place.

Did anyone see a familiar world last week?  I know someone asked something similar on the Network in the midst of all of it, but I have to ask it myself as well.  I almost shouldn't be surprised, but we only visited a handful of places, and I didn't see anything that was at all familiar to me.  

After a week keep either indoors or quite busy, I've more than a few things to attend to.  For one thing, there is the cafe, as ever.  I'm sure it's more than a little worse for wear after a weekend of those tourists.  And this is to say nothing of my own errands.  

I'd keep myself indoors again to avoid these very peculiar people--I'm not sure at all how to describe what seems to be wrong with them--but I've too much to do and I'm tired of being kept indoors.

Riff, I'm going out for a while.  I'll be back later this evening.

"event","After such a week as we've just had, and now it seems that the tourists are back again today.

And this time, I actually did as I so often said I would: I kept to myself, well inside, away from the windows and the Network, and I tried as best I could to properly recover from this last week and all its madness.  These sorts of days are always very pleasant ones to stay indoors reading--even things read a dozen times over or more.

After all, I think most everyone I should have once hoped to see here again are here with me now--Merry and Riff are both here and are not soon to leave my side, I know.  I've no need to watch for them this time.

And yet, I realised quite soon after that there are yet others who seem to come into the City on days like this whom I should still like to see, even if I may not quite hope for it as I did with Riff and Merry so long ago and so often.  

So I think I shall engage in a little foolishness and put myself out on the Network and let myself be seen at the windows.  I feel quite certain that the usual clutch of girls is yet there, ready to scream up at me.  Maybe this time I'll toss a letter to them, or a handkerchief.  I think they'd be delighted bt that.  

It's quite time I tried something a little different in all this madness.  And I've seen all of this more times that I think many have.  I wasn't here in the City for a week before it happened to me for the first time.

And, yes, exciting as it always is at first, I know I'll be quite exhausted after a few moments of it.  But these tourists certainly won't mind or care.  They really can be rather like insects in the way they can find their way into anywhere or anything.  

So I think I shall be a fool today and show my face after all.  But at least I'm quite aware of my own foolishness.  And perhaps there's something clever in that.

Welcome to the City, I suppose.

"event","Another day, and more, and worse.

I had thought, at first, that perhaps we were only enduring another curse--albeit, one that transformed the boundaries and lands outside the City rather than the City and its environs as a whole.  Yes, I know there's never been a curse quite like that--perhaps a few similar to that, but nothing quite like that--and yet, that was what I assumed it to be when it all first began at the start of the week.

I suppose that was all quite shattered when the message from the 'deities' came through--and from the 'Stewards' alike, it would seem.  I don't know if anyone remembers them at all, besides me.  They offered us a chance to go home before, but it wasn't at all as we had hoped.  I think that fairly well shattered our trust of them.

So what are the 'deities' doing in dealing with them?  And in making promises that we could even go home?--if we play by their rules, of course, collecting 'items' for their sake.  And ridiculous items, so far.  Stone eggs hardly seem the sort of thing one should collect if the City is adrift and anchorless.

It does prove that this is very much not a curse, even if it may seem rather like one.

What is it we're supposed to collect for them today?  I hardly believe their promises, but if we play by these rules and do as they've asked, we might at least restore things to something like normal--as we did when those harpies attacked, when the Clock stopped ticking, and even when the 'Stewards' appeared the first time.  It doesn't mean I have to keep with the spirit of the ordeal.  I don't want to do all this, but I'd rather the City's usual madness than this.

And here I'm prattling on as though there's nothing going on at all.  I suppose I like some ordinary things in the midst of madness like this.

Merry, keep indoors until this is over--and I do mean <u>all</u> of it, not only the chaos and monstrosities that seem to be roaming about today.  <strike>After all, those same creatures tried to kidnap you when they were here before--</strike>  You'll be safe in the opera house.  And you can always call for me or for He-Who-Kills or for anyone else in the opera house or even for Rosella if something should happen.  Wait for me there and keep yourself protected.

Riff, you and I shall be going out.  If we're to collect things for the 'deities', I should like a little help.

I wonder--the City seems surrounded by the revived bodies of the dead today.  Isn't that rather something that mad doctor would be thrilled by?  That is rather one of his favourite pastimes, to mock the will of God and defile the bodies of the dead by forcing them to stand and move again.  

Well, I've never said the City was any better than him.  I think I ought to destroy a few of these creatures, if only because it still sustains my opinion of the whole affair: leave the dead to death.

Riff, let's go.

<font size=-2>[The image snaps out of oblivion and darkness, but there's not much to see: just light and shadow, alternating, a little darkness, a little light, things too near to the lens to really make sense, possibly a passing shirt collar, an ear going by, the same glimpses repeating a few times.  And while there isn't much to see, but there's a lot to hear: more shuffling, ruffling, sliding, moving sounds than one might know what to do with.  It's as though someone has the camera very near to his face, but is moving all the while, and doing...<i>something</i>.

Perhaps this video is entirely accidental.  Yes, yes it must be.  After all, when that left ear goes past again (after the whole of the left side of the face), one can see that it is wearing a small jet earring.  For those who know it, it may be quite recognizable.  After all, Cain wears such an earring.  And, given these brief glimpses, it seems the person (one must assume it to be a person) in such close quarters with the Network device has the same dark hair and pale skin that Cain does.  And he isn't inclined to make accidental video posts (or video posts at all).  Certainly not doing anything quite like this...

Yes, it's most certainly Cain, as can be seen when he pulls back from the Network device fully to regard it a moment, blinking green-gold-green cat-like eyes at it.  He considers the device carefully for a little while...only to lean back in to it again and--what <i>is</i> he doing?  From what one can see from the camera's view, it seems that he's rubbing the sides of his face, his jaw, and his temples all along the corners and edges of the Network device.  Over and over and over again.  And looking (as best one can see) quite content as he does this.

And this continues for no little while until, as accidentally as the recording was begun in the first place, it is ended: he, very fortunately, managed to hit the ""end"" button in all of this.  And, with that, the video drops away into darkness again with a snap--]</font>

Rosella--

My darling, I think we should be more than secure here, and well-hidden.  I've spent the whole of the morning watching every road in and out of this city and I've seen no one who seems as though they've been sent in pursuit of us.  And you may think it dangerous, but I even made mention of having heard rumours of our escape to a few people, to test the waters and to see if they knew of us, even in rumour.  But no one knew a thing.  Indeed, even if they did, I think none of them would have said anything.  The ladies especially--every lady I've yet spoken to is so fairly obsessed with propriety she's just tedious to speak to. None are so naive as country girls would be and none are so worldly as town girls would be.  They're all so bright and clear, they're fairly saints, but they're not the same as the girls who've just come out. They <u>know</u> their own purity and intend to keep hold of it. It's equal parts peculiar and infuriating.  You shall either be in good company, my darling, or you shall have to mind yourself very carefully.

But, still, we are utterly unknown here, just as we wanted.  We have not been pursued--not by anyone and not for anything.  The only ones who know of us are ourselves, and we can keep these things secret for as long as we like.

We shall have to be patient if we mean to marry here, even as unknowns.  I've money enough to obtain a license from the vicar.  That would keep our being here and our intentions more secret than having the banns published and trying to endure that.  It's almost a pity we fled here instead of Gretna Green--we could be married already if we had, but we would have almost certainly been caught, and perhaps even before we made it so far as that.  Better this way, I think.

Such are the choices we have had to make, again and again and again.  If we do mean to stay together, we have had to make them.  It's as though the world means to test us.  So much as fallen on us since we first met--my father reappearing out of nowhere after having been thought dead for so long, and all the horrors of the things he's done trailing along after him, his attempts to pry us apart--but they won't work.  Not now and not ever.  I will stand against him.  The title is mine, the fortune is mine, the name is mine, even if he has returned.  I am still the Earl of Hargreaves.  It is all mine by rights and I will use that to stand up against him.

And yet I'm still in hiding like this, sheltering in tiny rooms in a theatre.  Yes, no one will look for us here, but it does seem rather desperate.  If we ever find ourselves truly desperate, my Uncle Neil may yet be on my side.  I can write to him still and he may send us help.

I'm scheming too much again, aren't I?  I ought to be happy that we made our escape as we did and that we were not pursued.  And you, you were still willing to come with me when I asked you, despite what it means for you and your reputation.  That's what comes of associating with utter rogues like me: your reputation is ruined.  But I hope that you're happy, despite it all.  

We've nothing--nothing but one another.  And that will sustain us.  

It really is safe to be out in this city.  Come out this afternoon.  I know you were never very fond of London, being such a city of stone.  But there's a wonder of a park here, and forests all around.  Come and walk with me this afternoon.  No one will know who we are and we can at least play at being happy for a little while.

I will be home to you soon.

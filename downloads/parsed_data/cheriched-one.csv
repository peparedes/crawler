"event","Funny how you might think that you know someone really well but then they go back and stab you right in the back. Hurts don't it? It's worse when you actually liked that person too. Any kind of like. I don't have time to write about it now, but I will later. Until then... Keep guessing what or who my entry will be about.

Warnings:
Monday April 4 to Saturday April 9, DON'T MESS WITH ME.
Don't IM me and then be silent.
Don't e-mail me for a while.
I'm in a bad mood."

"event","He placed those diamond tears in her eyes
And said lady don't you scream
Don't ask and I tell no lies
For this is just a dream

I was talking to Kyle yesterday. He broke up with me. Said he couldn't handle my feelings and problems. He got mad at me for telling him how I felt. I needed to tell him though. He was hurting me. He didn't even know. I don't need him though. I hope he can see that too. It's not that I mean to hurt him. It's just that I can't be with him. He's like a ghost. I never hear from him. I don't know why I was stupid enough to stay with him even though he was hurting me in ways beyond repair. I wanted to cry. I still do. I just wish that it didn't hurt so much. I miss him, but I know he's not thinking about me. I'm just another problem in his book. 

How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad
With intentions good
Was all he ever had
But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long and I've
Given him all that I could
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Giving up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with something once so good?

How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goobye?

Is this the end
Are you sure
How should you know if you've never been here before
It's so hard 
To just let go
When this is the one and only love I've ever known.

How do you find the words to say
To say goodbye
When your heart don't have the heart to say
To say goodbye?"

"event","You know what. I really don't care anymore. If you don't like me then that is your problem. If you have a problem with me then that's your problem. Especially when it comes to my life and my friends. NO ONE is going to exploit my friends to the whole AO_World because of some damn grudge that you have on them. I DON'T CARE. You don't have to like the people that I hang out with. Stop acting like you are all ""high"" and ""mighty"". I hope someone just smacks you and tells you how they really think of you. You need to stop butting into my life. I don't get all up in your sauce so stay out of mine. You have a problem with my girls then you say what you gotta say to them and stop hiding behind your damn LJ ranting on and on about it. You need to stop acting as if I am a baby. I can take care of myself. I've been doing it for a long time. I don't need no one to be hanging off my damn back watching everything I do. I can chill with ANYONE that I want to. I DON'T need your approval. If you don't like it then shove it up your fucking ass and bounce on it. I don't care. Bitch and complain all you want. You gotta go behind people's backs and call them a bitch in your LJ right? You ain't man enough to say that shit to my face? Far as I'm concerned,  I am not talking to you anymore. That only makes you the bitch. I don't care what you do with your life because I know that I am not stupid enough to make the retarded mistakes that you do. I know what I want in my life and you sure as hell ain't in my plans."

"event","Hmm. My life is in shreads as usual, but who cares? ^_^ Obviously no one. Anyway, I am torn between fueds and fights and ranting and raving and it's driving me INSANE. People just don't know how to pick up their damn phone and call a therapist. Don't come to me with your problems because I don't want to hear them. I have problems of my own. I don't know why you people constantly come to me ""Mia"" this ""Mia"" that. It's ANNYOING. I don't want to hear or see it. If you think I'm being a bitch then so be it. I don't care. Complain all you want, I DON'T CARE. It's people like you that drive all the sane people into insanity. Why do you think a lot of people are getting murdered now? It's funny how you can meet someone and never see signs of him/her being CRAZY or DERRANGED(sp?). But anyway, you never know that person is crazy and everything until you start seeing signs of it MONTHS later. You people should watch that. I had to learn the hard way. Besides... you don't even know if I am one of those people. Anyway. Enjoy!"

That really pisses me off. Not only is he desperate... he probably has a disease. You never know what I might find down there. But anyway... I was getting to another point. I just had the misfortune of forgetting what it was. I always wonder what makes someone dislike another person who they do not know. I have yet to find an answer, so I guess I will be searching for a pretty long time.</STRONG></FONT>"

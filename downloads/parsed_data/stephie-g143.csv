Well, im stuck at home right now in Arizona watching every music video that ever existed in this world. I still wish i could go back to Germany. There is this guy who wants to get with me but he always cheats with his girlfriends and im with Geoffrey. I haven't written in here in a long time. How is everybody??? My summer really sucks. I have to go to Maryland next month to go to my fathers wedding. Then im going to pennsylvania to go see Alayna. When I get back it'll be like a week till school starts again.I'll be in the 9th grade finally. Well, nothin much goin on.Peace out."

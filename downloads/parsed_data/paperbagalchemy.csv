<li>This started as an inside joke during period six lunch.  A paperbag containing pumpkin pie from <lj user=""zarephathcs"">'s basic food class was picked up by Z, who began to use it as a puppet.  <lj user=""full_mental""> and <lj user=""zarephathcs""> declared that it should become a Fullmetal Alchemist puppet.   After debate, a Scar puppet was created.  

<li>  We decided to create short skits out of this using a digital camera provided by <lj user=""zarephathcs"">.  

FAQs

<b>Why do you guys laugh so much in the videos?</b>
I'd like to see you try to do it with a straight face.

<b>You don't sound like (Voice Actor Name Here)!  You suck!</b>
These are our own interpretations, sorry. We're ARTISTS and SPAZZY FANGIRLS Ed's sake. Only one guy is brave enough to voice act with us. 

<b>Who's In The Group?   Who does What?</b>
Meg (<lj user=""zarephathcs"">): Director, Camera <s>nazi</s> woman, Staff Writer, <s>Only non-mustanger and only reason anything ever gets done </s>
Lia (<lj user=""full_mental"">):  Voice of Edward Erlic and Winry Rockbell, Staff Writer, Production Hostess, Puppet Maker, <s>Possesor the muse in a cage (tm) and an overdose of spazz</s>
<a href=""http://AketA.deviantart.com"">Becca</a>:  Voice of Misc Fangirls, Puppet Maker, Staff Writer
<a href=""http://GraniteClaws.deviantart.com"">Shroom</a>: Voice of Alphonse Elric and Riza Hawkeye, Staff Writer 
<a href=""http://www.fictionpress.com/~lifeismycliche"">Tara</a>: Voice of Misc Fangirls, Puppet Maker
<a href=""http://inf3rn0-br33z3.deviantart.com/"">Z</a>: Voice of Scar, Gluttony and Kimblee, Staff Writer, Puppet Maker
 <a href=""http://supermega-me.deviantart.com"">Alex</a>: Voice of Roy Mustang
Erin (<lj user=""stumpthegreat"">): Voice of Armstrong's Sparkles
 <a href=""http://ashleyweirdo.deviantart.com/"">Ash</a>: Voice of Havoc and Misc Others, Puppet Maker
Kori: Voice of Envy and Cain

<b>Camera...nazi?!</b>
Meg has to yell at everyone to shut up on set constantly and not to abuse the puppets.  And she gets pissed easily while filming, mostly because everyone seems to BS a lot more than they should be. 

<B>Where do you film?</b>
We generally film at <lj user=""full_mental"">'s house, but we occasionally film in our local high school.

<b>How many ARE there of you?!?</b>
Um...*counts on fingers* Eleven... and thats all at this present time.

<B>Where do you write the skits?</b>
The term 'staff writer' is used losely, as Paperbag Alchemy is mostly an improv group.  'Staff Writer' refers to people who come up with ideas for skits.  Normally these ideas like, ""What would happen if...?"" or ""Hey!  Let's do a skit about..."".  Nothing is scripted before hand.  If anything, our actors breifly discuss what to do a moment or two before filming.

<b>Where do you get your ideas? </b>
If its not full_mental's muse-in-a-cage (tm) then they normally end up coming from way too much sugar, caffine and our own very twisted fangirl minds.

<b>When will there be updates?</b>
We generally film about one month's worth of footage in one day and then space out the videos over the course of the month.  Usually 1-2 videos are posted.  There is no specific day that videos are posted, but we generally try to go for once a week.  (Depending on the month and circumstances, it may be more or less.)  We adverstise new videos at <lj comm=""fm_alchemist"">.  You can also add us to your livejournal friends list.  It will feed right into your livejournal and you'll have the most up-to-date videos at your finger tips.

<b>When do you break?</b>
Usually we take breaks during holidays or when there is something extremely important going on, like finals for classes.  

<b>I be confused X...@!</b>
Umm...sorry about that.  In the future there'll proably be better sound quality, lighting and more zoomed in on the puppets, so that might help. We were also thinking of posting a script of what we're saying in each episode as well.  (Although this is quite, er...tentative.)


If you have any comments, we'd love to hear em!
If you have any complaints, we'll probably ignore them! (Or use em in our next production.)


<b>NOTE:</b> So far, we admit to stealing crack from various people. And we will steal more.  Well, perhaps not steal.  We'd like to think of it as 'borrowing and adapting it to our own needs.' Okay.  Just think of it as the highest compliment we can give you. We always credit.  If you don't understand the references, we suggest you click these credited links.

<li>We're back, temporarily.  We'd like to apologise for the total lack of updates the past few months, life kind of came at us.  Al's voice actress got a boyfriend, a few of us went to comicon, our camera nazi became entirely devoted to western comic books and we had finals.  We DON'T know how often our updates will be, but we'll try to post at least one video a month.  As for this month's update schedule, we only have one other video at the moment, so expect that in two weeks.
<li>Comicon was really fun, thanks for asking.  We didn't have a table, we just walked around.  
<li>HUGE apologies to those expecting us at AnimeNEXT.  We were going until we found out tables were no longer available.  We're SO SORRY.

AnimeNEXT is begining to look iffy, although we're still working on details.  Our main issue is transportation.  We'll keep you updated.  The following of the PBA Cast and Crew will be there: Camera Nazi, Fangirl/Al's Understudy, Al's VA, Roy's VA, Archer and Envy's VA.  We're unsure who else will be going, but that's the tentative list.  We PROMISE to keep you guys in the swing of things!

We're also having technical issues with our cameras right now, so videos may not go up as fast as we planned.  We're REALLY sorry about this guys.

Also, please wish a Happy Birthday to Al's voice actress <a href=""http://graniteclaws.deviantart.com"">Shroom</a>!  She's turning 16.

"event","Personal production notes for the weekend.  Ignore.  Available for cast and crew, and an idea of what you'll be seeing in the next month or so.

-Valentine's Day:  The fangirl from the last episode, rather upset, goes to find Archer.  She convinces him that he is Cupid, and that he must make Roy and Ed fall in love with each other.  Sillyness ensues.
-Chuck Norris: Armstrong vs. Chuck Norris.  No more can be said.
-Cooking Contest:  Ed just sucks, Winry does fairly well, but ends up using MACHINE oil instead of cooking oil and Sheska reads her book the entire time, drops her book in the batter etc.  Then while they're trying to judge, Al wanders in, freaks out about their suckyness and bakes a pie.  Then it ends up that even people like Roy and Armstrong can cook better than Ed, Winry and Sheska.
-Winry is Arrested for Manslaughter:  Ed and Winry are in Winry's workship.  Ed gets Winry into a rant, she wrenches him, and then is arrested for manslaughter.
-Group Therapy:  After the infamous yaoi episode, the puppets go to therapy.  Amongst this things that happen is Kimbly freaks out and hugs Al's leg like a teddy bear and refuses to let go.
-Ed, Roy, and Al Read Fanfic: Another shameless poking fun at of Mary Sues, Yaoi, and OT3s

Still taking comissions.

<b>Art</b>
Today we were supposed to get together at Lia's and film the Valetine's Day special we had come up with, along with some other skits.  However, be as our home town got covered in about 15 inches of snow, we're not filming today.  Luckily, we did have some other things in store.

We assume that most of you know that we're going to be at AnimeNEXT, selling some of our own art and goodies.   We're also going to be selling <b>Paperbag Alchemy posters and custom paperbag puppets!</b>  Although we can't reveal everything, we did want to make up for our lack of videos by posting some of the poster art!  

All of the art is drawn by <lj user=""rubin_pezz""> with flat colours by <lj user=""zarephathcs"">.  The shading itself is noted at the bottom of each piece.  They're not complete yet (We've gotta add in the PBA logo of course!), but it should give you an idea of what to expect.

There's been a few minor changes, as Becca had to sub in for Al's voice actress.  We also have been working on lighting, thanks to a great theatre light that Lia found in her basement.

<b>Announcements!</b>
First and foremosst!  We're considering going to Wizard World Philly Comicon and AnimeNEXT this year.  We're unsure which one we'll be bringing our paperbags to.  Also, we're unsure if we should get a table or not, so we need YOUR HELP in deciding.  PLEASE respond to the question in your LJ comments or respond to the poll <a href=""http://aketa.deviantart.com/journal/poll/114841/"">here</a>.  THANK YOU.  <i>Note: Should we get a table, we will be selling cast and crew artwork/comics (because Meg writes a comic).  We may also do custom paperbag puppets.  This is all tentative.</i>

Second of all, there's a good chance that this journal may become friends-only for copyright reasons.  We suggest adding us.  You'll get a direct feed into your LJ too, so everyone wins!

Finally, we have <b>an update schedule!</b>  New videos, when properly cut, will most likely appear on Sunday.  If not, raws will be posted on Mondays.  This will go throughout the month of January.

<b>Videos!</b>
Roy takes some time to reflect on the previous year and talk with his office staff: <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=au3F4kZc2f0"">here</a>

We sincerly apologize for the footage today people.  We were supposed to have everything cut by today, but due to a lot of technical errors, we decided just to post the raws.  Eventually we will have the films cut together, but as Lia just aquired Flash player, you'll need to give us some time to figure it out.

If you plan to shoplift, let us know.

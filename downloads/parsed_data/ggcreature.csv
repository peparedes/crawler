Last night I had a dream where I had some kind of brown spotted terrier and I named it Dougal (""Doogie"") and it was super cute.  I think it was supposed to be a Jack Russell. 

Anyway now the seed has been planted AND I already have a name picked out AND I went to the Santa Cruz SPCA website (the place we got Beezy) and look at the cute dog they have!  Tell me he wouldn't make a cute Dougal:

I also want to quit my job, because now that I have my own dog it kind of sucks to deal with other people's dogs all day, in the same way that nobody likes other people's kids.  The reason I started working at daycares is that I needed my doggie ""fix"", but having one dog - and certainly TWO - kind of solves that problem.  Now I'm just a poop-scooping vomit-cleaning floor-mopping burnout :("

Secondly, I just googled ""Marley & Me animal rights"".
What.  The fuck.  Nearly all the reviews are like ""omg the movie is so great it is a delight to dog lovers everywhere!""  Even crazy old PETA supports the movie, having convinced the movie people to change the script (Marley is adopted instead of bought from a puppy mill).  Still, there are so many things wrong with this movie, and from what I hear the book is way worse.  
Positive reinforcement is still pretty unfamiliar to a lot of dog owners, and it would have been so easy to use the movie as a way to teach dog-friendly training.  Instead they chose to glamorize choke chain strangulation.  There is nothing cute or funny about the way this dog's behavioral issues are dealt with.
Every time a movie like this comes out, dogs are adopted on impulse and abandoned.  After 101 dalmations came out, shelters saw a huge increase in dalmations, which are especially susceptible to defects from poor breeding practices.  Beverly Hills Chihuahua: more chihuahuas in shelters.  You can bet the puppy mills were working hard to crank out enough lab puppies in time for Christmas.

P.S. Try googling ""puppies for sale"" sometime.  A lot of commercial breeders use the internet to sell puppies, copying text and pictures from legitimate, responsible breeders to make their operation seem reputable.  This is especially unfortunate as so many people are complete fucking idiots who don't know any better.

GUYS, SERIOUSLY, I GOT A PUPPY!

We got Beezy (shelter name Kate) today, and she is so much cuter than the pictures I had seen.  She's small - around 11 pounds, 5 months old, and in all honesty probably the cutest puppy I've ever seen.  She was put in a drop-box (what is she, a library book?) with her litter at a tiny 8 weeks and has lived in the shelter this whole time.  She's super super hyperactive, like A.D.D. even for a puppy, but she's also really well behaved.  She's crate trained, a little bit potty-trained, and has only played with approved toys - no chewing of electrical cords, cell phones, or shoes so far.  

Bragging about my kid:
I gave her dinner tonight one piece at a time, and each piece she either did Sit, Stand, or Down for me.  Did I mention she's only 5 months old and never had any training?

So basically I can't stop smiling and I love her and Kevin loves her and she is going to have a blast playing with all the daycare dogs!

Last weekend Lisa and Ernie and I went to eat at Dick's Last Resort in Old Town.  There was a big group of people there being pretty rowdy, considering they were in the 40 year range.  I'd say the majority were smoking, which is gross.  There was a lady wearing an entire flag outfit including the sequined hat, which was grosser.  There was some slutty old bitch wearing pants that were a combination of jeans and sweatpants, which was grossest of all.  So all in all they were pretty rednecky - can you guess yet who they were?  I didn't put it together, and then I noticed they were putting these stickers all over that said SDMM.  Now did you guess?  It took me a few more minutes to get it:
They were minute men.
For insight into why I immediately hated them, rewind to a few weeks earlier.  I was on the train and there was a magazine on the seat next to me.  I flipped through it and found this article spotlighting an illegal immigrant.  It was basically the same story you've heard a hundred times about the hardworking dude who went to great lengths to come work in the US.  Call me a tree hugging, head-in-the-clouds liberal, but that's quite an effort.  What the fuck have I done to be here?  I just am.  I sure as hell didn't walk through a desert for 3 days without water, or even ride a bus for several days.  And let's face it, I bring nothing to the table.  Like many of us, I slack off at work (if I deign to even get a job) and then bitch about not getting a raise.  I'm fairly sure the same thing goes for the fucking minute men.  Why do they have any more right to be here than someone whose great great grandparents didn't immigrate before some arbitrary cut-off point?  
Oh, and I don't believe that ""supporting our troops"" is a good enough excuse.  That does not make you a capital-A (cue music) American.  If you haven't really truly paid the price, get out.  If this is such a great country, you should have to earn the right to be here.  And if that were to happen, I wonder who would come out ahead; Sally Mae Flaghat, or the guy who runs the taco shop?"

"event","ok, FUCK. OPRAH.  seriously.  she is a horrible woman and i hate her and all that she stands for.  
today she brought in 3 sons who had turned their father in for armed robbery.  i guess the dad used to be an upstanding citizen, but then he had an affair and robbed like 5 banks with an unloaded gun.  so these 3 grown men made a decision that affected their father, a grown man.  i don't have a problem with that.  what i do have a problem with is that oprah has spent 2 days making everyone in the nation wallow in the supposed misery the father has put his sons through.  they are whining and bitching about how they are sad and confused and don't understand how their father could have done such a thing and lied to them and boo hoo hoo.  the father has apologized a lot and is willing to pay for his actions, but according to oprah AND the guest psychologist she flew in to help her deride him, his apology was ""empty"", and he ""just doesn't get it"".  they want the sons to really think about their feelings and how their fathers actions made them feel and what this means to them... bullshit like that.  
if you are a grownup you make decisions and you stand by them.  that's what this father did.  he robbed banks, and he pled guilty and went to jail.  the sons did too.  they turned their dad in to the police.  and they need to move on.  what possible use would it be to get all huffy and offended like the dad took a gun into their own personal houses and said ""hand over your wife and kids""?  if anything, they should feel guilty for sending their dad to jail.  but somehow HE put THEM in this horrible position where they had to make this monumental decision and gol-ding-it he is just scewing up their perfect lives!  what possible good does it do to have oprah's pet psychologist not only validate them in this, but actually suggest that the 3 sons get together and have a good cry?  She literally told them that a good solution would be to cry together.  am i just too masculine for my own good?  is it that crazy for me to be thinking ""so what""?
at one point the dad was saying that yes, he would turn his father in if his father were a pedophile, murderer, rapist... at which point oprah interrupts with ""or bank robber?"".  that is exactly oprah's problem (one of them?).  she lumps 60 year old men who rob banks with unloaded guns because they were too old to get a job with murderers and pedophiles.  i mean, killing children, taking money - it's practically the same thing!  to her there is no possible way for a person to make some really bad choices and yet NOT be an evil person.  bank robber = bad guy.  it is absolute.  and her fucking brainwashed audience applauds in absolute agreement.  oprah could -and probably would- say something like ""your husband sneezed too loudly, so you erupted in a fit of sobbing and forced him out of the house with a kitchen knife... you go girl!"" and the audience would cheer.  not a single person would say ""hey... isn't that a tad harsh?  she sounds a little moody to me.""  cause fuck, man, it's OPRAH!  
the glaring contradiction, of course, is that i should have turned off the tv instead of watching it all and then writing up a blog bitching about how oprah offends me.  but i like the background noise when i'm working.

"event","ok let's see... i made friends with a cute girl in my italian class.  well... myspace friends... but soon... soon she will be my friend.  and by soon i mean class tomorrow.  i will tell her my best jokes, or better yet, not tell her any jokes. i got ""friend requested"", so i was checking out her profile, studying up on useful data for when i woo her tomorrow, and i saw that she likes the color orange.  
which reminded me: remember punky brewster?  i only remember 3 of the episodes, the first that came to mind being the one where punky falls hard for this hunky older boy - i remember him being indeed very hunky - and learns that his favorite color is orange.  she immediately begins dressing herself entirely in exclusively orange clothing.  This is essentially what i was thinking of doing.  i am not well.  eventually punky comes to terms with the fact that the hunky boy is too old for her, it would never work.  i can only conjecture as to whether or not this will apply in my situation, as this girl is just a tad younger than me, but also has a boyfriend.  
the second episode of punky brewster that i thought of is actually the first one, cause i thought of it months ago.  it is the one where punky and friends are playing hide and go seek.  one kid, i think it was the little black girl, becomes trapped in an attempt to hide in an old fridge.  she almost dies somehow (runs out of air, probably), but is fortunately rescued by punky's adoptive father.  a couple of months ago i was walking down n. chorro and i happened upon an old fridge, door wide open.  ""hey, i should get in there"" i thought.  and then i thought of punky.  i kept walking, had i not... who knows...  to this day i wonder what horrible fate might have befallen me.
i actually had a little help from geny bringing this last one to mind.  but it all came rushing back.  remember the one where punky's illiterate friend is babysitting her (punky's?) little brother?  the brother drinks liquid bleach or drano or something, and gets all poisoned and sick.  the friend calls poison control, but as she is illiterate she is unable to read the offending bottle (induce vomiting, etc).  i remember that episode being pretty darn intense.  i was so angry with that girl for not being able to read.  it is not her fault i guess.  we should blame the school systems perhaps?  i am not sure about the moral of that one.  
so, if you remember any more punky brewster episodes, tell me about them and we can be all ""oh MAN!  i remember that one!  that was awesome!  and punky's dog did that one thing... oh MAN!""
also, if you went around with a bandana on your leg like punky, i want to know about that, too.  i thought that was the coolest thing ever.  punky was a fucking fashionable little girl.
ps we can also talk about saved by the bell.  i'm flexible."

(please note that it is ""chipper"".  i'm chipper!)
i tickled kevin, but in a good way, so as not to get yelled at and then we wrassled and i won and he was like ""ow that is my arm, get off me you crazy terrorizing she-beast!  i can't believe you are so powerful!  and wise, also wise!""  ok maybe not all of that happened.  he wouldn't dare call me a she-beast.
there was this headline-y blurb on msn when i was checking my hotmail.  you know how they have the ""msn today"" bullshit with like ""10 ways to better eating habits""?  the headline was something like ""1 in 6 teenagers are bipolar"" and the article was saying that clearly all young people are either bipolar or have a.d.d., citing ""mood swings"" as evidence.  hey msn team, ever hear of hormones?  people have them, they are pretty rampant in adolescents.  there is, like, estrogen and testosterone battling for supremacy and all that stuff.  it's not uncommon.  i remember getting all pissed off at my mom for asking me how my day was, and you know what?  i settled down and grew out of it.  and sometimes, i don't feel like studying.  sometimes i would rather run around outside, and that makes it hard to focus.  but not every hyper kid has a disorder.  maybe, just maybe, it is not necessary for the entire population to be on drugs.  (ps i know that bi-bolarity or bi-polarism or whatever is due to hormone imbalances and shit.  just saying that maybe hormones don't have a ""normal"" balance 100% of the time.)
i promise i am still in a good mood.  i just wanted to rant, happily, about retarded drug-pushing grownups."

shouted enthusiastically at a girl about plywood and concrete (she started it!)
told jokes about mozart
performed my version of stand up comedy (""and what's the deal with lampshades?!?"")
followed a girl, repeatedly interrupting her conversations to inform her we have 2 classes together
made mating calls
thrown newspapers
laughed obnoxiously
and much, much more.

i am also becoming a huge linguistics nerd.  i am thinking about doing my senior project on pronouns.  i followed a guy today who talking in spanish on his cell phone.  i analyzed communicative strategies.  
this is getting way too confessional.  i should clarify that i wasn't chasing him through stairwells or anything, i swear.  i was just walking real real close.

the answer is NOT AS HARD AS YOU THINK
sometimes i marvel at the feats i manage.
speaking of which, i only attend classes 2 days per week.  i'm pretty much rad.  but i still contend that i am earning my education, because all of my classes are filled with retarded weinerly children and smarmy know-it-all globetrotters.
hey, it's a lot to put up with!
i mean it, you know those people that are always like going on religious missions to 3rd world countries, all befriending indigenous peoples so they can eventually gain their trust and BAM! CONVERTED TO THE GOSPEL!  yeah, those people.
wouldn't it suck to hang out with those people?
now imagine that there are several concentrated in one area, say, a classroom, for 2 hours at a time several times a week.  in the spirit of education, they tend to feel a need to share their wealth of wisdom with everybody... BARF!  now imagine that they are doing it in broken spanish with an extremely forced-sounding accent.

"event","i am a criminal. 
at approximately half past one today, i entered the el corral bookstore.  i proceeded to the art section to peruse the art supplies.  as i was looking at some packages of metal sheets, i phoned a friend to ask advice on brass vs. aluminum.  i lost reception.  i then wandered into the pen and pencil section and began browsing the merchandise.  the friend called me back, and we continued talking.  i became distracted and absently slipped the orange sharpie i had been holding into my pocket.  still on the phone, i left the bookstore and began walking home.  i reached the edge of campus, about where the stadium is, and i remember being vaguely aware of a golf cart in the road behind me.  suddenly, the golf cart screeches to a halt (i like to imagine that it is with tires squealing, rubber burning, and plenty of smoke) and two guys jump out.  ""miss!""  one of them shouts.  ""miss! may i speak with you for a second!?!""  
i am still unaware as to what the fuck is going on.
the guy in charge is steve from the bookstore.  i know him from having volunteered there briefly in the backpack tent.  he clearly does not remember this.
""do you have something you want to tell me?"" he asks.
""uhhh.... no.""
""did you not just take a pen from inside the store back there?"" 
(waaaaay back there, like blocks away)
the realization hits.  AAAHHH!!!
i start apologizing frantically, explaining that i was on the phone at the time and didn't realize what i was doing, etc.  meanwhile, i am digging around in my jacket pocket for this stupid orange sharpie.  it takes me forever, but i finally dig it out, hand it to steve with another apology.  
i figure that is the end of it.
i figure wrong.
steve wants to take me to his office to talk things over.  he asks me if i am going to a final.
i say yes.  i am lying.  it occurs to me that i have no idea what time it is, and that given my luck it is probably like 2:23 or some other odd time to have a final.  so i blurt out that my final is at 3, then too late i discover that it only 2:07.  i start stammering about how my final is at 3 but that i really really have to study right that minute.
steve points out that 3 is an odd time to have a final.
he lets me go, but i have to make an appointment to go to his office and ""talk about what happened"".  he starts telling me how to find his office.  ""i know where it is"", i interject ""i volunteered for you"" 
steve is unfazed.  he confiscates my id card and i agree to show up after my imaginary final. 
i go home and freak out for a while.

when i return to campus, i am much more collected.  i get to his office and peek inside.  he is nowhere to be seen.  i wander down the hall to have one of the office ladies tell him i'm there.  eerily, he appears right behind me.  this guy is like a phantom.  he is everywhere.  
he sends me into his office then goes off to do something secretive and intimidating.  there is a small closet where the surveillance cameras are set up, and while i can't see inside, i can see a student employee sitting inside watching the monitors.  some lady walks in and sits at one of the desks.  i think to myself ""sucks for you, lady.  steve is gonna be in here any minute now to kick you out so we can have this stupid meeting"".  steve comes back.  there are still 2 other people in the room.  he shuts the door and starts telling me about his firm policy on privacy.  i am trying to be polite and cooperative, but i can't help but widen my eyes and make an incredulous gesture toward the 2 extra visitors.  
""those are my immediate staff"" he tells me. ""they can stay"".  what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
anyways, he tells me that they have me on camera putting a pen into my pocket and then leaving, and that it would hold up in court.  i again tell him that the theft was unintentional.  i can tell he doesnt believe me, and because cameras can't capture human intentions, there is nothing to disprove the evidence or corroborate my story.  
now, i know there is no way that anyone is sending me to court, arresting me, or pressing charges over one orange sharpie.  but steve goes through some 30 minutes of intimidatory tactics anyways, walking me through all the courses of action that can be taken.  blah blah blah.  Course of Action C is the applicable Course in my circumstance.  Course of Action C is ""civil reparations"" which is basically blackmail.  it states that if i pay the bookstore for ""damages"" incurred by my taking a pen out of the store, plus a state fine, then they will not involve the cops, permanent records, etc.  sounds like blackmail to me.  
the minimum state fine as per ca statute 490.5 is in this case no less than $50, no more than $500.

i'd like to take time at this point to remind you that i took 
A SHARPIE.
ON ACCIDENT.
what. the. fuck.

"event","You know the whole Apu stereotype of the Indian guy working behind the counter at 7-11?  Well, Geny and I pull up to our friendly neighborhood 7-11 last night to get some hot chocolate.  Who is behind the counter?  An Indian guy.  The bad part of me immediately goes ""thank you, come again!"", and the good part of me laughs for a second and then goes ""come on, man.  that is messed up"" and then lectures the bad part on stereotyping.
We go to get our hot chocolate.  Geny pushes the button marked ""Ghiradelli hot cocoa"", but the hot chocolate that comes out looks funny.  Geny tastes it, and it is real watery.  So she turns to the Indian guy and says something along the lines of ""hey, your hot chocolate needs more chocolate!""  
The guy comes over to survey the situation, and informs us in broken English that: 
A) We are pushing the button wrong; don't push it so hard, and
B) the button corresponds not to hot chocolate, but to coffee.
Neither of these are true, and we wholeheartedly deny both allegations.  
My take on the situation is that the guy thinks ""Ghiradelli"" is the English word for coffe, or perhaps a type of coffee, ignoring the words ""hot cocoa"".
Anyways, we got Slurpees."

"event","i was walking down one of the hallways at school today, when i passed by a case full of awards and ribbons and such trappings.  i didn't get a good look at everything, but this image was burned into my retinas of a small-ish wooden plaque that read ""3rd place cheddar cheese"".
my school won 3rd place in cheddar cheese!  i have never really had any sort of penchant for school pride, but i am actually pretty pleased.  WAY TO GO, CAL POLY!  WAY TO GO, CHEDDAR CHEESE!
i think it would be a good idea at job interviews to declare solemnly that my alma mater holds the prestigious ""3rd place cheddar cheese"" title."

"event","i am thinking about asking the 'rents for a station wagon for christmas. an old shitty one.
a) i can't think of anything else.  and i don't want to try.  i don't really need anything.
b) it sounds really fun to say ""i got a station wagon for christmas"".  ""what did you get for christmas?"" ""a station wagon.""
c) apparently i dig shitty ol' station wagons. i am not sure why. the realization is still settling in.

anyways, step one: get bachelor's degree
step two: get station wagon
step three: learn to drive station wagon.

(steps four through death:  mindless job as a cog in the corporate machine. *.  look forward to biz. cas. fri., happy hour, drinking to forget.  meet husband; marriage ensues.  health insurance.  2.5 kids, soccer practice, orthodontal bills, replace carpeting, etc.  send kids to college. take up knitting.  die.)

*also 401K but I have no idea what it is or where to place it chronologically."

"event","1) I like rocks.  I like thinking about rocks, and about how they are formed.  I like looking at rocks.  I like books about rocks.  Rocks are just neat.  Vote yes on rocks!

2) My ride home, otherwise known as Boyfriend, wants to leave tuesday morning.  ""OK"" I said, as I generally have no qualms about skipping school.  But, that was before I found out I have TWO tests on tuesday, for the same teacher.  Doctor Fagan, conveniently and immaturely abbreviated to Dr. Fag., was being all bureaucratic about it when I asked if it would maybe be ok if he rescheduled the test, or if I retook it at a later date, or if i took it early.  All spouting shit about how his tests are scheduled exactly 6 business days apart, about how Department Rules are pretty clear on The Issue, about how technically it would involve special permission from the Department Chair and <a href= ""http://www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Class-attendance.htm""> this</a>, and all manner of retarculousness.  Allow me to sum up:
   a.  i was frustrated
   b.  i might be taking 2 tests tomorrow
   c.  is it at all ironic that i haven't started preparing for these tests?

3) In other school-related news, the crisp scent of senior projects is in the air.  I keep hearing people casually mention that they are developing a flight simulator, or (something I couldn't understand involving photons) or building fucking particle accelerators and whatnot.  My friend that is, in all niceness, basically a retard, is doing something involving this machine that calculates the light-sensitivity and responsiveness of algae.(???)
Me?  I think I am writing a children's book.  A multilingual children's book.  I plan to start going around casually mentioning my ""book deal"" that is in the works, getting all haughty about ""my book I'm working on"", dropping hints about meetings with editors and publishers and publicists and the like.  I think to up ""my credibility as a serious author"", I should start trying to keep my intense dislike of children ""on the d-l"".  Children's book vs particle accelerator.  Think about it.

4) I was home last night waiting for Kevin to call, as planned.  And he did, as planned.  Then he mentioned we had been invited to a cocktail party.  NOT PLANNED!  The next hour and a half was an awkward flurry of activity.  I think most girls take 1-2 hours to get ready for that sort of thing, but I think most girls own dresses and don't have to get all frantic about it.  I frantically called roommate #1, asked to borrow a dress, and then frantically tried on* like 7 dresses that didnt work: didn't fit, didn't match my shoes, etc.  So then I called roommate #2, in whom I hadn't much faith because she is kind of a tomboy.  But, turns out she has the. most awesome. dress. ever.  Daaaaaamn it was sexy.  So I called Kevin back to tell him that yes, i finally found a dress I could work, frantically showered, did my hair into some mom-style 'do, tried to put on some makeup, improvised a shoe repair, borrowed some sparkly earrings,etc.  So there you go.  I got all girlied up, and we went to a cocktail party.  It was very much like a 6-th grade dance.  There were a bunch of sorority-type girls in little black dresses dancing to Hanson (I swear to god they were dancing to Hanson).  I showed up <a href = ""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v20/Ghoztzer0/Nov19006.jpg"">pimp-style</a> with about a half-dozen young, uncomfortable-looking boys in slacks and skate shoes and gasp! button-up shirts!  Tucked in!  And nobody was ""mixing"".  As in there was a definite 6-th grade-esque boy/girl dichotomy.  I was disappointed.  Usually when I hang out with said group of boys it is a total sausage-fest.  So I expected at least one of them to at least try to get laid.  It is my theory that girls in cocktail dresses are an especially easy lay.  Think about it.  They are going to be feeling a lot sexier than if they were wearing jeans.
* Trying on dresses is so horrible!  Have you ever tried it?  So many straps and slippery layers of cloth and zippers and it is hard to even tell what is the top.  I swear there were a couple that I just had to hold up like ""wha???"" and sit there and just THINK and THINK and APPLY LOGIC before I could even begin to try to put it on.  Man, I tried stuff on that may not have even been an actual dress.  I do not know.


Ok, this has gone on quite long enough!  (Something a dad would say, even though I have never heard a dad say it.)"

"event","So, I hopped online yesterday and ordered some generic brand printer ink, at a tiny fraction of what Epson would have liked me to pay them.
Don't you think buying things online is kind of nerve-wracking?  I do.  I am used to getting fucked over/swindled, and unfamiliar websites make me nervous.
But when I got home today, around 3 o clock, MY INK WAS HERE!
I am amazed at the quality of customer service!  The responsiveness was astounding, and i only paid like $3 or $4 for shipping.
I am not shilling for inkgrabber dot com or anything...
It's just that inkgrabber dot com has renewed my faith in humanity."

"event","Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is my last update from down under.  I know that I haven't been quite steady in my update... the computers here sometimes don't have internet or not able to hold this site.  But anyways.

Thank you to everyone who has supported me, thru prayers, emails or financially.  Without you, this trip would have been impossible.  

This trip has been everything into one.  I feel like I've known everyone here for years, but yet I just got here and now its time to go.  God has done some amazing things, mostly in the background.  As far as I know, no one has come to Christ directly because of us.  There hasn't been massive amounts of decisions here or revival or anything dramatic.  But, as is the aussie way, seeds were planted, relationships were made, and the love of God was shown thru loving and caring about one another.  We don't have anything tangible, like a church or a massive programs started, to show for our 2 months.  But we do have a church filled with people that were praying over us and saying how our visit here was a blessing.  And we have 100 new friends that will span over 10000 miles.  This trip has been worth every penny, every effort.  God was here in Australia with us.  He was here before we got here and he will be here long after we leave.  And thru his grace, he decided to use Kelly and I.  We weren't ""needed,"" but in God's plan, we were used.  And for that, I am blessed.  

Thank you once again for everything everyone is done for us."

Everyone is getting over their sickness.  Which is a good thing.  I just had a cold, but kelly had the flu.  Nasty stuff.  But everyone is getting better and life is good.

A program called Youth Alpha is starting up in the church this Sunday.  Its basically a program for youth that explains the basics of christianity, like who God is, why Christ had to die on the cross and things like that.  Its EXTREMELY important, a lot of kids will be hearing this for the first time.  And its a combined effort from local churches, interdenomination in the area.  So please keep this ministry in your prayers.

Hope everyone has a good week.  I believe Locust Grove just finished a VBS *yay VBS!* so I hope that went well.  

Ta for now!"

Hope everyone is having a lovely monday.  I know I am.  

Special shout out to the best popaw in the world.  He's turning 75 sunday.  Yes, he's an old man.  But I love him and miss him dearly.  So... happy birthday popaw!

Kelly is sick with the flu.  She went to the doctors yesterday and they put her on something.  So hopefully she'll get better quickly.  I'm supposed to be staying with her this week, but the entire house is sick.  So I'm staying with sharon for a couple of days till the germs go away.  

School break is over!  Let the business begin!  Can't wait for that.  Althought I had a very busy weekend.

Saturday, Willam Aerts took me to the footie.  Australia football is like a wierd hybrid of soccor and american football.   I'm still inclined to the american version...hee hee hee.  It was nice and rainy and cold.  So that made pleasent viewing.  Luckily, we were under an awning.

Then.... the highlight of the day.... We saw michael w smith!!!  We got pretty good seats and all.  And he sung a lot of his old favorite.  But I think the most exciting part was that we got to hear another southern accent.  Strangely enough, I missed that.  

Oh well.  Please pray for kelly to get better.  Its no fun being sick 10000 miles away from your own bed.  

Have a great day!"

Today was a gorgeous day today.  Lots of sunshine and I think it got up to 20 degrees C.  So that made me smile.  The porters (debbie, tim and beth... the family I am staying with next week.  Kelly is there now) took us up to Healsville to an animal sanctuary.  So I finally saw a kangaroo in australia.  And all the other aussie creatures.  I have to say... aussie has the weirdest creatures imaginable.  But it was great fun.  I petted everything from kangaroos to koalas.  

Tomorrow is the second of our holiday programs at church.  This is for primary school kids and the theme is ice age.  Last week, we made snow men, snow flakes, icicles, and other snow items.  Tomorrow, we are making a winter wonderland and going on a search for the abominable snowman (who will be played by martin, our pastor... who will then share the stories).  The theme is based around the individuality of snowflakes and how God made them all special.  Great fun.  I look forward to that.  

This Saturday should be interesting.  A few guys from the church are taking kelly and I to a football game, aussie style.  Willam Aerts, one of the guys we are staying with, might be the biggest fan imaginable of the team we're going to go see (go richmond!).  And he's more excited about taking us than we are.  He and Judy (his wife) have a daughter around our age (17) and she is going with us as well.  Should be great fun.  Then... what I'm really really really excited about is.... We're going to go see Michael W. Smith in concert!!!!!!!  He's touring australia and he's in Melbourne and a group from the church is going.  He's always been one of my favorite.  And to see him in concert in Australia is just too fun.  I can't wait.  

Wow... this was a long entry.... I'm getting better at this journaling thing.... Yay me!

Have a great day!"

Yes, I know I'm in a foreign country and all.  But I can still celebrate.  We did have a fourth of July party.  Of course, aussies just want any excuse to get together and grill a hamburger.  But it made kelly and I feel more at home.  And taboo might be up there as the best board game ever.  Everyone should go out and buy it just because.

And... thats all I got.  Have a great day!"

Its holiday time for the land down under.  And most of the church activities are cancelled due to holidays.  So Kelly and I have had an opportunity to see the country side and some of the touristy sites.  Very fun.  Saw the ""penguin parade.""  Basically, the little penguins come up from the beach to their nests at sunset.  Very cute.

I gave my testimony at church today.  It went really well.  Very exciting.  I was nice and nervous.  But it did go well.  Yay that!

Can you believe I've already been here a month?  Time has just gone so quickly.  I leave in about 30 days.  So strange.  It seems I only got here last week.

Hope everyone is having a great day/week/summer.  Later!"

"event","Hello again!  Only four days between updates.  Not doing terrible.

Hope everyone is happy and healthy and enjoying the heat (its supposed to get down to 4 degrees cel. tonight.... brrrrr).  

I'm with my new family now, the Readers.  There is Mark and Helen, and their two children, Nick (age 8) and Russ (age 6).  Living with boys is interesting... I'm learning all about the superheros (spiderman is all over the room) and whatnot.  I'm staying in one of the boys room.  I find it funny that my makeup bag and hairdryer leaning up against a bad guy from... something.  At the end of these two weeks I might get them all straight.

We went into the schools again today.  The elementary age kids have the opportunity to have christian religious education (with lots of paperwork and parental signitures and whatnot...).  But most of these kids have no earthly idea who God is or what he's about or anything.  And today we were talking about the characteristics of what we wanted in a friend.  And then Martin (the pastor at Pakenham Baptist, where I'm working) explained that God was all these characteristics and more and he wants to be your best friend.  The look in those kids eyes just amazed me.  Its amazing how we take for granted how much knowledge we've been raised with and know about God.  

So thats my story for today.  Have a great week.  And until next time!"

I switch houses tomorrow (We rotate every two weeks).  I was just getting attached too.

"event","Sorry!  I'm terrible.  No update in 10 days.  Bad me.

Life is still good here.  We're still wonderfully involved all the time.  So far we've been involved with 2 different youth groups, 2 seniors groups, nursing home, speaking in schools, young adults bible study, sunday school for kids, craft group, a playgroup, and a fellowship group.  Very busy.  We are really having a good time getting to know everyone and building relationships and whatnot.

Kelly and I also went into Melbourne yesterday and were tourists (tuesday is our day off).  The city is beautiful.  Lots of gardens and old buildings and it was great.

And we're living with a two year old at the moment.  And kelly and emma (the two year old) are playing ""ring around the rosy"" in the living room.  Very cute.

Well, I will try to be better in updating.  Have a good day!"

So far, we've participated in the 3rd-6th grade program, the high school program, the young adults bible study and sunday morning worship.  This church is a very very active church and are constantly growing.  Its a joy to be around them.  

For the W.O.W. group (the 3rd-6th), we had messy night.  To make a long story short, we ended up covered in oats, egg, custard, pudding, jello, sprinkles, ice cream, rice, popcorn, sprinkles, and all sorts of other nasty things... But it was fun had by all.

But everything is going well.  Having a blast.  Its really cold here at times, which is strange.  But still having fun.  Hope everything is well in the states for everyone!

"event","Well ladies and gentlemen, its offical.... I""M IN AUSTRALIA!!!!!

We just got to our host family house about an hour ago (its 8:01 p.m. on Wednesday, June 1st here).  We've spent the last couple of days in Sydney being oriented.  So yeah...

Oh my goodness.  Sydney is the most beautiful city I ever seen in my life.  The opera house and harbor and buildings and everything just make this city fabulous.  

The plane ride however, was not so fab.... 14 hours is just too too long to be in a plane....  However, quanta's is the nicest airline that I've ever been on.  So it made it more barable.

There are 24 students in all over Australia.  All of them are fabulous.  And kelly is even better in person than over the internet.  Life is good.

God is going to do amazing things here.  And that is even more exciting than all the opera houses in the world.  

But I'm barely keeping my eyes open right now... So bye!"

great 21st birthday, it was so nice having friends here.  it was the textbook 21st birthday (except for the pete part.)  it was painful when everyone left.

i love asheville,
i love unca,
i love my classes,
but it feels so fruitless.  something is missing.

i dont know.  i wish i had closer friends here.

But are there hidden depths beneath that surface?  Who knows?  When the woman in Pret gives me too much change, I tell her so.  When she gives me the right amount, I pop the coppers in the little metal charity tin that they hide underneath the chocolate bars.  I cry at a good film, send my mum a card on Mothering Sunday and enjoy suprising Lucy.  Underneath my cynical roving eye, I'm a sloppy, slushy romantic at heart.

If I return home early from work I give my tube Travelcard to a friendly smackhead so he can continue to pump cheap drugs into his damaged veins.  I work long hours and feel guilty about earning so much money.  I'd like to do some good in the world and I'd very much like to pack it all in and spend some time travelling on the east coast of Australia.

it all started last night when i went to work.  i was exhausted and i held it all in
when i was leaving work i made it to the staircase before i started crying
i came home and took a pain killer and felt ok
went to sleep
woke up this morning in pain
started crying over something stupid
took another pain killer
was ok
only got out of bed for lunch
stayed in bed the rest of the day
tried to call in sick to work
but the manager guilted me into coming for a few hours
i hung up the phone
started crying again

its not even the pain.  yes, it hurts. yes my jaw is really stiff and i can't really open my mouth.  and i can't eat.

but its more that i feel exhausted.  like i've been dragged along the sidewalk.  like i will start crying if someone looks at me the wrong way. because i'm just that tired.  and pathetic.  and i dont want to get out of bed.  because i dont feel up for facing the world.  because if i get crap from a guest about the new menu, chances are, i will start crying. at the table.  in their soup.

and the most upsetting thing for some reason, is that noone understands.  i didn't know it was going to be liek this.  i thought i'd be up and running in two days.  i didn't know i would be so emotional and feel so incredibly drained when i haven't done anything to begin with.  that i would WAKE UP feeling drained.  morgan says its the pain killers. and she would know.  anyways i feel like a baby, i feel like i'm overexaggerating, but how can i be overexaggerating when i'm crying, right?

anyways, i have to get out of bed because i have to go to work."

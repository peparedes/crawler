"event","Sexiquette: Not just a cool word I made up. 

Tonight we are gonna be talking about the do's and don'ts of those first few times you have sex with a new partner, or having sex with a partner that is not someone you know super well. You may like whips and chains, but sometimes its not a good idea to bust those out till the fourth or fifth time. (With all kink its a good idea to have a chat while everyone is fully clothed and aware...but hey). Also we are gonna talk more about those first few dates, going along with the sexiquette, dating etiquette. There are some things you shouldn't say or do till later. You know what I mean. If you don't, def tune in, I'll let you know. Emily will let you know. Melissa will let you know, but politely. 

Tonight call in and tell us what you think: Is being honest about sex a good or bad thing in terms of the big question ""How was it?"" Lets face it, every time is not earth shattering and or James Bond rock'n. Sometimes it just plain sucks. Do you tell your partner the truth or be gentle for whatever reason? Let us know.

ALSO:

Please be aware that Earth Day at C of C is on April 21st, tabling outside maybank and events throughout the day. There will also be a concert held by C of C radio on the night of the 20th. Free stuff and food on both counts, so please join us and show love for your mother...mother earth!"

"event","So in the classic model of wayne's world, we as people just walking about pass other people and several 'shawing' moments a day occur. If you don't have these moments, check your pluse. The world is full of attractive people, but what do they do to make themselves so tempting ? 

This week's show topic is what we do to attract others. The way we dress to the way we behave or drop hints about ourselves in conversation are all attempts to gain the attention of someone, or cause them to be attracted to you in some manner or another. What are some things that work and what are some things that definetly do not. Also we will discuss first date Do's and Don'ts. After all, just because you got a seat at the table doesn't mean you are gonna win a whole lot of anything if you don't play your cards right. 

This week's call in is going to be corny but fun. The winner will get two tickets to the music farm. Welcome to the dating game, describe the first date you would take me on.... You can reach us at the station through AIM or Call us up. To listen to the program, go to www.cofcradio.com. Our phone number is on that site and the AIM sn is cofcradio. We hope to hear from you!

Also in the upcoming weeks we will be having our very own sex quiz bowl. We are looking for a guy to challenge either Melissa or I (being Lauren) to Emily's fierce question selection. Drop us a line at any of the above mentioned methods or e-mail us at cofcsextalk@gmail.com, you could also comment on this journal...if you wanted to get really wild and crazy that is. :)"

"event","We had a really interesting show tonight. There was alot about pratices of different cultures. Some of which were kinda scarey to me, but others were interesting. I got a little into some of my animal kingdom things. IT seems odd to me to seperate humans out from the animals, but I suppose that is sort of what we were implying when we talked about animal sex pratices. 

If anyone had anything to add on the topics shared, we would love to hear from you. I'm very sorry to the callers that tried to reach us. We are still apparently having telephone issues, but as i was leaving the station the radio guy was already hard at work fixing it. 

Thank you once again for listening. Let us know if you need any info about the things that we share on air!"

"event","Sex talk show time! Today we are going to be talking about different approaches on being single. We seem to be kind of focusing in this area, which had been our plan, but we'll try to spice it up with advice on approaches to single sex... be that a friend with benefits or maybe a bit more about sex for one person. We also want to talk about what parts of the human body are sexy besides the bottom and the breasts. Surely other parts of the body do it for us, so we figure something else does it for you. After all, we all do it, we all love to do it..and you know you do it too! Hurrah for Mel Brooks. All of our features will still be in place and we'll have another guy taking the Shifty Guy Test. Let us know if you'd like to be our shifty guy by e-mailing us at cofcsextalk@gmail.com

In anycase, it was sad to hear that the Capes show was canceled, but we'll keep you posted on future music outings in our area. 

This weeks call in, which hopefully we'll have the phones back on line, is what is a most uncommon aware of someone else's body you have had a thing for? 

Get in touch with us by phone or aim while on the air."

"event","Hey guys!

Thanks so much for listening this semester and for all the helpful comments and phone calls!  We had a great show tonight; we talked about birth control methods, expecially the birth control pill.  What a great way to wrap up the semester.

The STI of the week was herpes.  Fun, fun, fun for all.  Check out some more information about it here:  http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/stdherp.htm

The sexual slang word of the week was ""seventy-seven.""  Most of you will know this as the spoon position or the cuddling position.  Basically, it's where a couple is spooning, with the guy behind the girl, and the guy enters the girl from behind in this position.  Here's a link:  www.sexual-health-resource.org/sex_positions.htm#urgent

"event","Time for the last sex talk show of the semester. Its sad because really we just were able to get started. Anyway...this thursday's topic is birth control. We are gonna talk about a bunch of methods, but we are gonna spend some extra time talking about the pill and the male latex condom because these seem to be the two most commonly used methods. 

We are also going to talk about the pill for emergency contraceptive because it is an option that is still little used despite that fact that it can be effective and help prevent unwanted pregnancies. 

Emily will be playing a great selection of music for us tonight, good for soothing your test and paper weary ears. 

Don't miss the sexually transmitted illness of the week or the sexual position of the week. 

This weeks call ins are going to be: 

A way to include putting on a condom as a sexy part of foreplay...

And what birth control method do you prefer and why ? Some people like to hear how methods work out for other couples and may not know much about them...you'd be helping others learn from your experiences. 


Tune in tonight at 10pm till 12am at www.cofcradio.com 
You can send comments and request to the aim screen name or the phone number on the cofc radio web site. 

See ya ~.^"

"event","Happy soon to be Turkey Day everyone! Don't miss the parade...they normally have musical scenes in them from current boardway productions. Very cool. And everyone loves the Snoopy balloon. 

In any case, we won't be having the show this Thursday in light of the break, However the thursday after that we will be featuring the topic of Birth Control. While this may sound kinda boring and a no duh topic, i can promise you, there are alot of methods out there. More then likely a few that even the most sex savvy person has yet to hear of. There are alot of questions about the pill even, what it can mean to miss a pill, etc...
I bet guys have some questions they may have been too afraid to ask....their girlfriends. ( But not Emily and I...hint, hint.)

Emily And I have decided this is a topic on which there is alot of information and it might be helpful for you if we sorted through it and presented some of the good stuff. 

If you have any questions in particular you would like answered, feel free to post them in the comments and we will find out the answer for you. 

Till next thursday..."

"event","Wow.  That was an extremely successful show!  Thanks to everyone who called in and sent us helpful tips, tricks, and requests!  Interacting with the audience definitely makes the show more fun for Lauren and I, and I hope it makes the show more fun for you guys, too!

So, enough with the exclamation points.  Tonight's show was on the Kama Sutra--always a fun topic.  Okay, so maybe the Kama Sutra does deserve a few more exclamation points (!!!!!)  Here's a basic rundown of some of the things that we covered during the show, and our set list for the night.

          --Bjork:  Possibly Maybe
          
6.  The fun parts of the Kama Sutra,  the Kama Sutra's steps of foreplay, a discussion on impatience, and some quick information on tantric sex
7.  Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) of the week:  chlamydia.  It's gross.  Be safe.  Get tested.
8.  The third set of music:  more indie pop
          --The Capital:  Round Again

"event","I went looking for the position I gave out on the air last week but was unable to find the particular picture. 
So here is a verbal run down, no laughing! Think of the nuns...

Butterfly:
You need to find a coffee table or higher bed. This can also work with a bed low to the ground if the guy kneels. The girl should lay on her back and tilt her pevlis up, resting her legs near the guys shoulders, but not over, as the guy is still gonna wanna be between the ladies legs. The tilting is easier if the guy places his hands under the woman's but to help maintain the postion. The idea is to stimulate the G spot. 

Also a nice free site i found http://www.sexualpositionsfree.com/index.html The person that makes this site is also selling a book. Looks informative."

"event","Wow!  We just finished our first show.  We had some serious technical problems which made the first part of the show difficult, but the WONDERFUL technician came in to fix things for us.  Many thanks to him for making the show do-able.  This week's show was on sexual harassment.  We mostly focused on a new California law that has broadened the definition of sexual harassment so that co-workers who feel that an in-office relationship is creating a ""hostile work environment"" can take legal action.  Read more about the article here:  http://www.proskauer.com/news_publications/newsletters/California/2005_09_21

I think my favorite part of this show is going to be the Sexual Position of the Week.  This week's position is The Butterfly.  See more here:  http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/now-news/harass2.html

Anyway, thanks to all of our listeners for tuning in!  Extra thanks to those of you who called in!  We'll talk to you all again next week.

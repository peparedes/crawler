"event","As of March 20th, 2006, I am a happy camper. Through what most seem to call ""talent"" and the ever present Lady Luck, Awful Waffle has overcome great odds to accomplish our greatest feat to date. After completely missing the entry for The Break contest, being given 150 tickets a week before the show, only to sell 50, having our set time pushed back a half hour, which cut our crowd in half and basically knowing that we had no chance to compete with a band that was already established (with ex-members of The Youth Ahead) and another band whose parents can afford to give their kid's band ""job security"" and send them to meet fall out boy on TRL; Awful Waffle, by a magnificent stroke of karma (PRYDE was disqualified), will be playing the BAMBOOZLE festival. For those of you who don't read cheech's LJ, this means that we will be, in essence, opening for the likes of AFI, Lifetime and Method Man at Giants Stadium on May 7th.  I want everyone that reads this to go; I want everyone that reads this to tell everyone they know to go.

And just in case there was any doubt in your mind...I'm excited...very excited.

P.S. - Expect the Yet-To-Be-Titled Awful Waffle EP soon."

"event","It hasn't hit me until now. Jake's leaving for college tomorrow I believe, and I'm gonna miss him so much. hopefully I'll be able to see him during some breaks or something. The closer I get to sunday the greater I feel the strain of leaving home. Even when I went to visit the college last sunday it still didn't feel real to me. Is this how the majority felt at graduation? I'm having (with the exception of a few events) the best goddamned summer of my life. And it's all about to end. I can only pray that next summer will be half as good as this one. I guess most people will be back, I can't imagine where else anyone would go for summer. But it's not like, hey summer's over, see ya tomorrow in school. It's like ""Hey, summer's over...see you next summer"". I'm not going to see some of you for a year, and that kills me. Even though I'm sure I'll stay in touch with each and everyone of you, I just don't know, I feel like I'm going to cry. As crazy and as mushy as this sounds, I'm going to miss this place. It'll be here when I get back, but will it ever really be the same?

And something that I'm going to bring up to awful waffle before I leave, but I'm gonna let you all know too:

I know I just met these kids in may, but in the time I've gotten to know them, I've grown to love them all as if we were all brothers. I would take a bullet for any one of them, that is how much they mean to me. They've helped me through some pretty hard times, and they probably don't even know it. 

Jensen, my summer would not have been complete without you. Your lust for life is inspiring. And by lust for life I mean lust for weed and womens. I dunno if I would've been able to make it through this summer without you man, you have made me smile when I thought there was no smile left in me. 

Cheech, you're asian, that is all...Haha, but seriously man. You are a huge reason why awful waffle is what it is. And above all the band stuff, you've been a great friend through everything. I had the security of knowing that if there was anything I needed to know, you were only a phone call away. 

Stiffie, you're aura if innocence was immediatly shattered the first day I met you. Your ability to refresh jokes that would otherwise be dead has continued to amaze and astound me to this day. Somehow a joke I've heard a million times from a million people will sound as funny as the first day I heard it coming from you, I can't explain it really man, but you're just so fucking amazing. 

Rob, I got to meet you at the world inferno show, but I never really got to know you until awful waffle. You are a fantastic tromboner...trombonist...tromboneer...? You're subtle enthusiasm for everything has continuously won me over from day one. You are one of the most level headed, down to earth people I could ever want to meet. You and liz are a fantastic couple and I wish you many years of happiness and babies.

Hons, you are the person I know I can turn to for a hug and a smile. You're the kind of person that makes other people feel great about themselves, and just being your friend these last couple of months has had a huge impact on me. I know that when I feel like I'm the worst human being on the planet, you're always there with the high five, and such. Also, you're a determined person, and i've seen that side of you and I can only encourage it. In the near future when it comes to merch and business matters I know I can count on you to get the fire under some asses to get things moving. You are the man hons.

Burry, you are the most talented bassist I have ever had the priveledge of playing with. You are intelligent, a little left of center and one of the funniest goddamned human beings I will ever meet. I can affectionatly call you the devil on awful waffle's shoulder. When we said ""nah we don't want to jeopardize our chances of winning cbgb by playing pee on you"" you were the one that pushed and pushed for it, and it turned out to be a decision we will never regret or forget. Many of our stage antics can be attributed to a burry brain hurricane. Also you took me to see my first divinity show, so I lovingly hand my divinity virginity to you. 

Shane, I know we met real late in the game, and have yet to really get to know each other (because you neeeeever shut up, haha), but it feels like you've been with us from the very start. You've become an awesome friend and an irreplaceable member of the awful waffle family. I can proudly say that I'm you're bandmate and more importantly your friend.

You all have made a huge impact on my life. I would not be the person I am today if it weren't for you guys. You've influenced me in ways I could have never even imagined, and together we've accomplished so much in such a short amount of time. I mean, we're playing with streetlight manifesto in october. When I Saw them, december 10th, 2004 at the stone pony I said to myself, man I would give anything to play with those guys. And now it's happening, do any of you understand how huge that is? I would give up everything short of family, friends and college to stay here and write music and play shows with you guys forever. And I'm going to try my fucking hardest to make this work because, I love you guys, and I love what we do, and mother fucker, I love peein on bitches!

VIVA LA AWFUL WAFFLE!

AWFUL WAFFLE IS PLAYING CBGB'S IN NY! how fucking sweet is that? some noname local band from nowhere NJ is playing their second show at the venue where the likes of the ramones and the talking heads started. FUCKING BIZARRE! Anyway, if you wanna go, I'm the wrong person to contact, but I can direct you to the nearest informed awful waffle member. By the way folks, this is a battle of the bands, the winner gets to perform at the warped tour! That's right, no typo there, fucking warped tour! My mind is blown, that's for sure. so if you can come and support us and it'll be great, or I'll break your fucking legs =0) have a wonderful day"

"event","Yeah so, last night was our xmas party.......holy shiiit. I really....really......REALLY hate tequila. You would too if you had to chug a lot of it. Fighting Cock is not good either, shit is strong. Yuck was nice, altough it was really strong. Date was hot, altough she had to leave early, which made me sad, but its ok, i had a good time regardless. Actually, almost everyones date was pretty hot. Proud of my brothers and their good tastes. (Still like mine though) Yeah, around 12 my pledge class was mostly passing out, we started drinkin wayyyy too early. But the good news is, i do have 3 nice new bottles of liquor. Yay for me. That will be nice for my trip home. Speaking of, i really cant wait to ger back. Spend some quality time in FL. Yesssssssss. Good stuff. Alright, im tired, and i need to study for these stupid exams."

"event","Yeah, so im a brother now. 8 Weeks later, and the last week being the worst, im finally a brother. Getting those letters on my chest was one of the best feeling ever, right there close to winning my first football game after like a year of losses. I think sororities should have to go through hard times so that they could feel the same pride. Oh so, on to the bad news. Im failing math. And i dont think i can get at least a 70 on the exam in order to get a C which i need to take the next course. Soooooo  im going to do 1 out of 2 late drops i get for my college career. Which means i take the class over again next semester. Good job dumbass. So, i think im going to switch majors next year too to business cause i suck at this math stuff. But something to look forward to is the xmas party this saturday. Gunna be EXTREMELY crazy, wow. I <3 xmas. Ho Hos to all."

"event","Yeah, so, this white stuff.....is it normal? Its like falling from the sky, wait, is the sky falling????? SHIT. Oh, wait. Nevermind, thats just snow. So is this suppose to happen? I mean, like is this normal? Oh, it is. Hmmmm. FUCK THAT, snow sucks, i just want to go back to florida and go to the beach. Ok, im done with that now. Its really one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen, to look out your window and see a light snow falling. The trees frosted, the ground turned into a snowball playground. Im sippin on some hot cocoa, doin hw and overall feeling pretty good. But i just wish i had a lady friend to be with, to enjoy the first snow of the year with. But thats ok, not something i would have counted on. Christmas is coming close, i need to buy presents. And with the coming of Xmas comes exams. My first one is next friday....havent been to that class since the second class of the year.....so it should prove to be interesting at least. Hope everyone is healthy, live it up"

"event","Well, my pledge trip was hella good, too many stupid drunken stories to even begin trying to tell...ok ok, except soap pissed on the floor and someones sweater in his sleep, and passed back out in his own piss, then the next day th kid put his sweater on in a half sleep, after we told him that someone pissed on it.....we practice good hygeine. Oh, and on the way back, i got lost in the bronx for like an hour, yeah that was barrels of fun. I cant wait to go back, broken down neighborhood with caddys and shit, just dont make sense. I still dont have my computer up and running, so im way behind on school and shit, my cuz just hooked me up with a laptop, so i usin that. I love being home, as much fun as college is, it just dont compare to being home, sleepin in youre own room, eatin good food, and being around family and youre best freinds. Im not going back, ive decided. David, you can take my place up at tech, Ill go to CC. Doin HW on turkey day sucks the big one, but food is awesome. The weather down here is awesome too, being able to go to the beach at 1 in the morning and just sitting there enjoying the breeze. Fuck Virginia and the 35 degree weather. Ok, food time, enjoy everyone......"

"event","Yeah, so, this morning, my computer starts makin funny noises (not funny haha) so i restart it. And the damn thing wont come back on, says im missing my kernel file. This is bad (in case you dont know) and i spent a greater part of the day trying to fix it, with no results. And wouldnt you know it, the timing on this was perfect. Tomorrow (well ok, really today since its 6:30 in the morning) i have a geology test (which i hadnt studied for yet and hadnt been to the class in 2 weeks) and i had to finsh a program cause im not going to be here all weekend since im leaving at 2:20 to go on my pledge trip. So, this really does come at a wonderful time. Piece of fucking shit. Im in the computer lab right now, with one other person whos sleeping on the floor (dont ask) and this comepletely sucks. Ok, just had to vent some frustration, i know you guys *really* care.....

On a lighter note, im going to be drunk starting at about....oooo...2:30 until sunday night. Yay. Lets hope i dont do something stupid....and if i do, lets hope i cant remember it...."

"event","Yeah, thats right, we beat Miami, the #2 ranked team in tha nation (was). We didnt beat WVU, but, hey, who even remembers that. The riots were fun, till the started bustin out with the riot gear, dogs, and tear gas. That wasnt as fun. Went to the house for a little post game.... that was hot. All in all, it was a pretty good night, coulda been better, but definately wasnt bad.

On a side note, i wonder where the hell were goin on our pledge trip next weekend...?

On a side side note, MIAMI SUCKS!"

"event","Yeah, so, last night is the best time ive had since ive been here. The halloween party was the shit. Being doorman definatley has its perks. Aside from the three liquor stations (screwdrivers, jungle juice, and rum and coke) there were 2 kegs and 200+ people in an apt. Which was fine until the cops came, scared everyone inside, and shortly after cut the power to our apt, which was interesting. My big bro def hooked me up by letting me stay in his room in the apt. Good times. Good times. Cant wait for next year.....yeah

P.S. - I love the costumes the chicks wore....wow
P.S.S. - Except for that one chick who dressed up as an old lady.....who does that, i mean, come on"

"event","wow... it's been so long that I don't recognize how livejournal is set up nowadays!  I have to admit... I have fallen into the Myspace trap. My soul is gone and my body numb.... but yet, possess such a small piece of mind.  So far.

Went to the Eric Himan concert lastnight.  Eric was awesome... but Levi Kreis was annoying.  Levi can sing and play the piano... but he has such pussy music.  It's true.  And he's kinda gross looking... and then he ended up hookin' up with someone I know (who isn't the healthiest... but hell, that's the chance you take when you have one night stands, huh?)... so I'm completely turned off by Levi.  I ended up gettin' pissed at David and Jake cuz they were being obnoxious when Eric started playing... and expected me to leave after the second song.  How retarded is that?  So I told them to leave and I would catch a cab home.  Which was expensive... but the cab driver was caucasion.. and rather gorgeous, and pretty damn funny.

I recently went to see Pretty Girls Make Graves... they were at the Crystal Ballroom mid February... and they ROCKED.  I'm just excited that their new album comes out April 11th.  Elan Vital is the title of the new PGMG album... The songs they played from it in concert were amazingly good.  And the new band member is quite talented, I'd say.  Not only is the new album coming out soon... they're coming back to Portland to tour on April 26th.  How awesome is that?!?  I just hope I'm able to see them... I mean I WILL see them again, but I'll probably be working early the next morning.

Speaking of work, it's going rather nicely.  But as work can get, it's being stressful.  Stressful only because it's long hours and i work 40+.  I also have some decisions to make as of late.  I have to decide if I'm going to continue living with Kelli or move back in with my mom.  I think I'm going to move back in with my mom-- I need to get some things paid off and taken care of and then I have to decide how I'm going to motivate myself, to get me back in school.  God knows I don't want to be doing stupid shit all my life.  I want to grow up in the sense of having a career and then basing everything else off of my career and free time.  I think that sort of commitment to myself needs to be made a priority.  Soon.  Or now.

Lena was in town yesterday... kind of driving through, but I got to spend a little time with here, which was nice.  We went to lunch and then got some gelato.  Yum!  Gelato!  Then she watched me waste some money on shoes.  The shoes were cute though. But I need to start savin' my money again.  Lame


Anyway, time to be productive!  (haha, yeah right!!!)"

"event","Well, i went out to beer bust last night.  Which was a bust in itself.  I was greeted by some random cute guy as soon as I came through the door (highlight of my night).  This guy just jumped on my face and convinced me that I have ""flawless skin"" (he's probably just some rice queen) and wanted me to know that it was my first compliment of the night.  Ha.  It was my only. I was on my fourth beer and realized that it was making me sick.  I'm not sure if I'm just not able to drink anymore or what... a few drinks are usually fine, but anything more and then they start to hurt my stomach.  My body's probably just pissed off that I'm getting all these empty calories and wants to devour something wholesome.  Speaking of wholesome, I kind of ran into scott.  Well, I didn't run into him, more like ran away from.

Scott showed up at the bar.  Which was awkward in general... I avoided eye contact, hell I wasn't completely sure it was him or not.  Scott ended up talking to this one guy that I'm not too fond of (he's an old superficial guy that likes younger guys... and he just creeps me out.  completely.) and I had to duck and run.  It was perfect, Scott was distracted by Older Nasty Guy.
(((Scott is someone I met a few months ago... and totally played my ass [so I think, anyway].  He pulled all these cute moves the night we met.  He also told everyone he was straight earlier that night.  Anyway, we met blah blah blah and we had some really weird nerdy conversations [that he provoked] and some serious ones... which kinda made me like him.  I don't know, a cute guy who's a nerd on the inside is a weakness of mine.  ha!  So he and I haven't spoke much since.  Just an explaination as to why things were awkward for me to see him out.)))
So I drug David to a different bar because I don't like feeling uncomfortable.  We hopped over to scandals to see if we could get in one game of pool real quick. As I got my drink and turned around... Scott was standing right behind me!  hahhahahahaha.  What did I do?  I said excuse me, with my head hung down, and scampered off (ok, i just moved out of the way, but it felt more like a scamper).  I said absolutely nothing to him, looked his direction a few times (which he noticed).  So I just turned into a chicken shit and never said hi or anything.  It annoyed me to the point of having to be such a passive idiot, and having to call him later.  Sure enough, I did and we talked.  But I didn't feel as bad as he tried to make me feel for not saying anything to him.  The bastard could have said hi.  You'd think if you ended up following someone, you'd at least have the balls to say hi.  But all in all, it was him.  we said hi.  and the lame ass night was over.  thank god.


I think one of the reasons why I never said anything to scott is because Corey was in the back of my mind.  Not like I couldn't stop thinking of him with hearts and loads of bullshit, but just contimplating.  I like Corey a lot... and I'm starting to feel as though I'm trying to sabotage things.  Looking for an easy way out.  Like a defense mechanism... get out before you get hurt type of thing.  I have much more important things to worry about... I should concintrate on those.  Like now, I'm fuckin hungry.  Must eat."

"event","Well shit... things have been decent in my world.  not the best, but could be a hell of a lot worse.  I feel as though my job is slowly sucking my enthusiasm away... but something that's been keepin me sane while there, is the crew I usually work with in the morning.  Great people... and times, indeed.

Social life lately?  Well, I don't think anything interesting has been goin on... pretty much the same shit.  Go out about once a week, I figure that's my only real connection to the gay world.  Have been contimplating if I really need one or not.  Although, if I sever ties... will I be able to meet someone?  Tough question.  I tend to be fairly sick after going out, mostly just coughin up phlegm for days.  An attractive trait, I know.

Don't really have a love life... been kind of wanting one though.  I've probably hurt someone's feelings, I've had my feelings hurt, and a fling here or there.... as of late.  I did meet someone Saturday night, and I do like him.  He's cute and nice (so far), but I don't think I should look too far into it because I feel pessimism slowly makin it's way into my mind... I've also noticed that I've become a little naive lately.  Whats up with that?



I'm starting to think that inside, I'm REALLY missing my good friends.  Like Lena, Erica, and Audrey.  And Rick as well.  I don't know, those four people have had such a great impact on me, and now that none of them are really near nor do I talk to often enough, I feel myself kind of changing.  And not in a way that I really like.  Kind of losing my grounded-ness and who I am.  It almost feels like I've slipped into a boring/stagnant homosexual/party-esque realm of irresponsibility.  Not that I've become some loser who doesn't take care of his bills and is a TOTAL wreck.  And maybe that's why I've been wanting a relationship.. perhaps there's this small chemical imbalance that's causin my fuckered mind to think that a relationship will patch things up?  Who knows why I'm actually thinking about all this, maybe I'm just discontent with what my future looks like at the moment, it would be a realistic analysis.  In my mind at least *happy asian smile*

Ok, this is far from my original intent (LJ Posting wise)


oh well, just an update, heh

"event","So... there's a group of ""Prominent Ecologists"" that want to move African wildlife to North America.  Such as cheetahs, lions, and elephants.  I'm not sure how I feel about this.. seriously.  It's a good idea to try and save endangered species... but hasn't transplanting wildlife been disastrous?  Either a waste of time cuz the wildlife cant survive or end up running rampant?

""Critics also point to calamitous relocations of foreign species in Australia. Rabbits brought from Europe swarmed across parts of the Outback, and noxious cane toads brought from South America to control bugs in sugar cane fields killed native wildlife.""

I would imagine that Lena would love the rabbit part.  Millions of bunnies hopping everywhere.

Just an interesting thing to think about



On to my life.

Starting the new job has been fun and stressful all at the same time.  I'm working 9 shifts this week with only one full day off.  It's kind of crazy...  especially having to be AT work by 630am and sometimes leaving at 11pm.  Rinse and Repeat.  Something I like about this new job is that it's more relaxed, sure I'm still waiting tables like my last job, but when I'm there at 6am and it turns into 12pm .... I hardly notice.  I mean that's a 6 hour shift... which is nice for a restaurant gig.  And then I have the whole day to do whatever I want (assuming I don't have a dinner shift)... of course I'm pretty fuckin pooped when 10pm rolls around, which is nice because it makes the repeat process so much easier.  One bad thing about this new job is that I still need to find parking.  I've been parking in the area that used to be used for this new apartment complex, but I think they're trying to change it to 2hour parking 8am-6pm.  I could always take the parking area by the water front.... but then there's about a 3/4 mile of walking.  I don't have a locker at work, nor really want one.  The long walk at 530am would be tedious... especially if it's raining.  Maybe I should give in and buy that $60 a month parking garage pass?  Eh... we'll see.

I still haven't packed all my shit up for moving.  It's already the 18th.  I need to get my ass moving.  Just need to get that fucking house key from Karina... that little turd is being such a procrastinator.  heh.


Alright, time to pack some of the little things."

"event","well shit... it's been awhile.  A friend actually reminded me of livejournal.  I don't really think that a whole lot has happened... other than the season changing and causing all sorts of fun chaos. To act like I update this thing on a monthly basis, I'll start here-

I got the call today.  The call I've been waiting for... for about a week.  The Hilton called and told me that my orientation is Friday.  SHWEEE!  I get to quit TGI Fridays!  SUPA SHWEEE! . . .. . . . . . Uhmm... I work Friday.  No good.  So we scheduled for Thursday the 4th.  I'll probably be working that day, but I'm sure I can pass it off to shift craving under worked co-worker.  I'm excited... I'm hoping I'll make 2x as much money there, hourly wage AND tip wise.  Not to mention that there wont be white trash (well, trash of all colors, shapes and sizes) at almost every table.  It's a bit nerve wracking though.

In a few weeks I'll be moving again.  Yep...AGAIN.  Erica is being shipped to Ohio for grad school.  Lame, but good.. would much rather have her stay here and play with me (heh), but careers are supposedly more important!  ;-)  I'm going to be moving to Salmon Creek.  I'm not real happy about Salmon Creek, but the apartment is going to be slightly nicer than my already nice place now.  There's going to be TWO pools and it's a gated community... I like Kelly and all, but she isn't going to be an Erica.  But I think Kelly and I will get along just fine.  Blah.  ramble.  Blah.

the garbage concert is on the 8th.  awesome!  my first time seeing them since i was a fan in 95.  about fuckin time.  seriously.  so erica and i will be in seattle thursday evening and leave saturday morning.  it kind of sucks that we're leaving on saturday cuz i have thursday through sunday off.... but she works saturday and sunday.  so whateva!

(it's hard to think with ""Africa"" by Toto playing on my computer-- i just wanna pick up a pencil [the one that got out my hickies] and sing into it like a microphone)

oh ha... if anyone wants to know how to remove hickeys.  i know how.  it's so crazy.. mine were gone in like 6 hours.  and they were purple!  crazy shit.

*how to remove a hickey*

1. Ice- take an ice cube and rub the hickeys in a circular, massaging motion for about 5-10 minutes.  or until you have that painful numbness (hopefully before necrosis sets in)

2. Dry the area well.

3.  (the odd part) Eraser - that a pencil and use the eraser... push into the middle of the hickey and turn it like you'r unlocking your car door. and just do it around the area, starting in the middle and move out. do that for some time.  it might hurt, but your slutty ass needs to deal.  you fucking snatchy slut whore.  

4.  check out the damage and repeat if necessary.


i cheated and went tanning after doing it. (hey!  i had work the next morning!!)




anyway, on to importnat news.

my friend shawn.  one of my partying buddies.  he's in deep shit.  well his last day was on sunday.  so he and a few other people went out..long story short.  lindsay rolled her car over.  when everyone went to see what was wrong.. shawn hit someone car door (bending it backwards) and while trying to avoid it, he swirved and his a friend.  pedestrian style.  broke her leg in 4 places and was in surgery all day the next day.  not only did he hit a car and a pedestrian, he did a hit and run.  dropped off his passenger and took off and now he's gone.

i just hope he's okay... but when he's caught, or turns himself in.  he's in deep shit.  we're talking DUI.  Hit and Run. Damage of someones car.  and crippling jody.  shawn is not exactly a big guy.... nor masculine by ANY means.  depending on what he's charged with... if he goes to jail/prison.. he's gonna break.   and that'll be sad.

blah.


okay, time for bed.  maybe i'll update when i see garbage.  that would be something to blab about!"

and now, i have something similar.  it's what, a month.  i'm sick again?  what the fuck.  but this time it's just strictly throat activity.  it's possible i caught the bug that's goin around... although everyone had horror stories of everything else, but mine is just throat problems.  it's kind of scarey because i actually lost my voice 100% this morning before work.  i couldn't even whisper words... it freaked me out so much...   was kind of comical how i almost attemped calling in at work.  but things got alightly better.. voice.. well, what was left of my voice, came back... and it sucks when your job requires you to talk. a lot.  i had to whisper to all my tables from begining to end.  oh man, i'm being such a whiner!

anyway, i can't wait til sunday.... hopefully i'll have most of my stuff packed by then so i can get all moved.  it'll be fun.  and i can't wait to get out of this shit hole of an apartment."

lost my cell phone last week

*present*
someone found my phone and turned it in.. hell they even called Tmobile and left contact info.  how nice is that?  so.. i finally picked it up today.  as if that wasn't enough... i bought a brand new phone. HA.  it's great though... the new phone is 100x better than my old one.  except it doesn't have bluetooth/IR/and a crazy vibrating function.  but i got hooked up and it's all good.

Erica and I are approved for the aprtment in fisher's landing (they're SO nice).. i'm excited.  we should be movin in around february 20th.  the apartment has a courtyard view AND there's a fairly large tree in the courtyard, meaning, in summer it'll keep our apartment cool but let us have a good amount of natural light.. and not blinding light.  yay.

I don't know if there's something specific going on, or if it's just the accumulation of all the little things goin on.  first theres the whole no roomate situation-- meaning i have a shit load of cleaning to do without the other resident here.  then if there's anythign they're going to charge us for at the end... i don't wanna pay for it myself.  and then the last bills that need to be split.  and it's not liek she lives in the area... she doesnt live on the continental US.  and of course the lease is up at the end of february... meaning i need a place by a week into february (just so i can get my shit moved) blah.. i'm ranting.

erica and i will be roomates, which is nice cuz it takes some stress off my shoulders cuz i'll be paying a hell of a lot less a month.

we went looking at soem places today.   i pretty much have my mind set on where we'll be movin... the apartment is gorgeous.  it's kind of funny cuz we've already talked about ""things""... like... no sex on HER furniture ( if ANY furniture is broken into by man sex, it must be cleaned-- like deep cleaned.  heh), no porn hangin out in the shared quarters (does that mean i can leave my nipple clamps, cock rings, gallon of lube on the kitchen counter... like i do at my place?), and that we will try to have an italian them in the living room.  well, she said italian, but it seems more like a color theme (italian [art] colors-- creams, browns, maybe reds and insanely gay fat chef's).

i'm curious as to how things will work, but i'll save money and it might be fun."

"event","so i spent a few hours lastnight movin some shit into the apartment and do some organizing as well as some home improvement stuff... i.e. putting in shelf liner (cutting it is such a bitch sometimes), organizing glasses/plate ware etc/ and whatever.  i brought my dog with me.  she was so excited.  to bad she isn't going to live with me... right off the bat.  i ended up goin home at 415 ish.  i was so tired... but i got some shit done.  which is great.

i spent today with erica.  we started off by goin to viet food.  yum!  it was odd that we were on a waiting list.  sunday morning?  weird.  then we ventured to all the random asian markets-- looking for non-food items.  we found some cool stuff.  headed off to world market/23rd right after that... and well, bought some more.  BUT i forced us to go to Zucari.  I swear, that store is always having sales and shit.  Erica ended up spending like 7 bucks on some really cool shit.  i think 5 items.  a total steal on her part.  i ended up buying these large glass star hanging candle lanterns.  i figures i'll put them in the window.  they just require one votive each.  there's a red one, dark purple, and a dark blue one.  they're very perty.  after all this shopping and exploring, we headed to alison/norlan's and played ""fact or crap"".... their 4month old kitten is so cute. it has A.D.D. and looks cross-eyed (i don't think it's eyes are messed up, just the color of her fur on her face).

then we had indian food.  yum!!


just got home... i'm pretty pooped...


tomorrow after work, erica and i are going to do some light shopping and help move some of my shit to my apartment.   we'll see how much gets done.  *passes out*"

I decided that for right now.... Lucky wont be joining me.  I would love to have my dog of 10 years come with me.  but there's too many factors at the moment that are keeping me from bringing her.  Makes me feel shitty, I mean.. she IS like my daughter.  I've had Lucky for half my life... will be sad to come home and not have her fat ass waggin and lookin all dippy and excited for no real reason.  :(

i finally got a hold of nonnie.. and talked about seein the aprtment (oh shit, i have to be there by 11 tomorrow.  grrrr).... and i'm still waitin on the lady to get my  application aproved.  i'm excited... who knows i'f i'm aproved, but i REALLY want this.  nonnie and i will be okay living with eachother.  at least it'd be better than my current situation.  blah blah blah

i just got back from firdays.  had a bunch of drinks with Liz, Lauren, Audrey, Mike, Boby and whoever and the hell was there.  oh yeah, Jessi-- cute cuy i went to skills center with in high school was there.  i still think he's cute.  and could rock his socks off if he wanted. hehe.. *slaps hand* ""bad jonny!""

Had a few drinks, got to sail, it was a beautiful day, and when dusk rolled around... the sky was pastel blue and purple... then the Full moon was skimming the clouds.  was way awesome.... and i figured out why people dream of sappy retarded things like ""sailing into the sunset"".... cuz i did that today.  of course not with a romantic other, but it was one of the coolest things to experience.  i got competive a couple times-- with other people sailing.  of course they had motorboats.. but we caugt some awesome wind and kicked their asses!  I got the hang of sailing rather quickly... probably why it didn't feel  like 4 hours.  We went from i205 to (just a little past)i5... of course we didn't just go in a straight line, we stopped by the floating market and dinked around a little.  anyway, it was awesome.

Work wasn't bad, i had one of my favorite Regulars today.  He's such a cool guy.  Everytime he comes in, I get him a bread stick and a water (right when he gets seated)-- he usually has low blood-sugar...  and he customizes a salad... so basically when he comes in, i'm right behind him and tell him what he wants to eat.  A couple of my regulars haven't been so regular lately...  maybe i scared them off.  heh.  There's these 3 hot guys that come in all the time.. 2x a week.

"event","ok, this post will be bitching-free.


So... friday.  what a crazy fuckin day.  (ok, i have to vent about something at the end.  sorry for the false hope)  My day started off at work.. blah blah blah.  Then I had a couple hours til my next shift.  I ended up going to the washugal river with Erica, Alison, and Summer (Paul and Nolen didn't make it).  The current was soooo strong that we couldn't even walk.  we tried.  and i would end up crackin up cuz erica would fall and the current would drag her away.   then summer lost her sandle... so me... the ""guy"" went to resue it... i fuckin got it, but the damn thing would catch onto the water current and prevent me from swimming.  swimming like that with one available arm is hard as all hell.  then i headed back to work... after gettin some nice sun and watchin some of the hottest white trash boys Washugal/Camas could produce.  got back to work.... and made zero money.

when i was gettin ready to leave... my (favorite) aunts and uncles from California showed up.  [[[WHAT THE FUCK?]]]  i sat down with them for awhile... it was great.  we all talked... they were all here for my cousin's wedding.  we made a deal.... i will find out if i can get paid vacation at work... and when.  and my aunts will fly me down to CA.  how awesome is that?  free housing, free ticket, free food.  and i'm sure they'd let me borrow their car.  hahahahaha.  i love wealthy aunts and uncles.  except for the fact that i rarely see/talk to them.

At the end of the night... i got a few drinks with Summer, Bri, and Jessica...  it was great.  I went to school with jessica... we were fairly close.  and then she dissapeared (went through some hard times with family).. got serious with her BF... dropped out of school.  Anyway, she's doin good now.  on the right track.  and she's still with her BF... correction-- fiance.  was a good way to end the night.


so... the family drama:
my cousins weddign was saturday.  my bro and i never got invited.  i don't give a fuck.  but my brother was pretty hurt by it.  i see why... but i don't think it's worth all that loathing.  anyway... my aunts were comin into our work on friday night to see us.. and to see if we were going to the wedding.  we rejected the idea.  and it turns out that our cousin is a fuckin pussy and has to lie about not inviting us... apparently he told everyone that he sent one and it must have gotten lost.  riiiiiight!  and then hsi brother (who was also visiting) said that my mom's invitation said to (my mom's name) and family.  ok, if that was true... then i see why everyone is all confused.

the thing is.. saturday morning, my mom came over after one of their get togethers before the wedding (she had to work in the afternoon).  my borther isn't very levelheaded.  so he started yelling at my mom over absolutely nothing.  was weird, i hate how he is.  but my mom told me that the invitation she received stated that it was for my mom, my aunt, and my uncle. just them, all in one invite.  sooo that was irritating.  anyway... we hate them.  and hope they rot in hell.  the end."

"event","ok, so i'm on a roll.  seriously.  i got stood up this morning.  sure, it's someone who's expendable.  but still.  i don't like being stood up or being made to feel inadequate.  not like i don't make MYSELF feel that way, but damn people all to hell.  all the confused ones, all the interested ones, all the flakey ones.  so on and so forth.

then i did absolutely nothing all day.  which is so much worse after that blip (being stood up).


but lena called and it was all sorts of fun.


oh yeah, and was being pressured into becoming an escort by some extremely hot guy.  i mean, i'd do him... on the house. hahah literally?  that would be fun...mmmmm. (so, if two hoes fuck... on a house [for arguement sake].. who pays who?"")

so, i'm curious as what tomorrow holds for me.  *looks up in the air yelling* WHAT NEXT!?  CHLAMYDIA?????!!!


*checks really quick*

whew!  just the normal milky discharge... almost had me worried!!  (ha, i'm kidding.  shut up.)


PS.  thanks for everyone trying to cheer me up.  you're all awesome. you're all thuper-thars!"

"event","i don't even know how to start this entry.  i know it's been awhile.  and so many things to ramble about.  but i feel... i dunno.... crushed.  a sudden slap of dissapointment... or depression.  or something.  i feel like crying and falling to pieces.  ok, falling to pieces is way too dramatic as to how i feel.  but my eyes did get watery and i felt like puking and ballin my watery eyes out.


today was soooo perfect.  went to work.  had a good day AT work... made good money.  then went on my casual date with chris to happy hour (no, just two friends.  nothing romantic.  he's straight.  and might know i'm into guys.. might not.  saving for future update.)... and i was starving.  ordered a lot of cheap happy hour food.  devoured it.  and felt GREAT.  not too full and not hungry.  was perfect.  although I did eat a lot...  but that's me.

went home.  then had my date with erica.  (haha, two dates in one day... and with people i've come to love) we went to the mall.  we ACTUALLY bought stuff this time.  when we go 'shopping' we usually end up empty handed.  but today was a success.  bath and body works was having an uber sale.  bought a bar of soap (to wash my piercings-- since body wash is awkward to use)... but it was something.  THEN we went back to my house and made some greek food.  soooooo good.  then made dessert!  it was so good.  ps. lime sherbet is the best. well, not as good as orange. 

anyway.. we ended the night with bridget jones.  how fuckin fantastic is that?  seriously...she just left.  oh say, 15 minutes ago.  me, on cloud nine, decides to hop online and check email....

KEVIN(!!!!!!)

decides to respond to my email i sent.. oh, about a month ago.  i was glad to see his addy in my mail box.  i shoulda left it unread.  just to make my day oh so much more perfect.  but i decided to read it.  i just don't fucking know what to think/say

i 

just

don't

know

!


basically it said that he's moving to portland this month (a little earlier than planned), but the thing that got to me most... is that he said he's giving up on the gay thing.  he wants to be 'normal', he doesn't want to risk his family or future, and that sex is over rated.  i don't know... i mean.  when we were dating.  i fell... correction--  i face planted the fuckin concrete for him... or well... just, i dunno... crushed, ok.. i'm trying to make myself feel better.  lets make it easy and honest on me.  i developed real feelings for him rather quickly and genuinely.  and from what i remember.  i wasn't the only one.  things didn't move too fast.  sure the feelings came quick, but it wasn't like we were getting married.  and then BOOM!  he cut me off because of his fuckin family, friends, and (psuedo/pretentious) future career (what they MIGHT think and how his 'bridges' might get burnt).  well, i was somewhat okay with it.  i mean, i knew he had shit he needed to work out.  i was crushed, but you know.  people have issues they need to sort through... i wished i could be there and help him.  but it seemed out of place.  anyway... he's going to be 'normal', moved away (of course only 10 minutes away instead of down the street)... and i don't know.  he also told me he has a girlfriend.  was a shock, but with the rest of the email, it wasn't that much of a shock.

anyway, i just had to ask if i ... WE should continue a friendship.  i understand with our 'past' that it would cause complications... but we still had a blast hangin out.  i really would like to keep him as a friend... but i dunno.  not like we've been actin like friends lately.  the whole no communication thing could be a problem.  

maybe i'm delusional?  seriously.  i could have sworn that there was some really awesome chemistry between us (friendship and especially more).  but IF things REALLY were that great.  how can you just excuse yourself from them.  completely.  i  just don't know.


i guess i haven't gotten over him."

"event","ok, i'm not sure if i already rambled about this before.  but i was just thinkin about the other day when i was training Megan. Megan and I were talking to one of our tables... and we were laughing... and then I snorted soooo fuckin hard.  it was loud as all shit and it hurt like a bitch too.  omg so amusing.  especially while everyone was cracking up, i got pissed and looked at megan-- ""SHUT UP!"" and walked away.  *sigh*  so funny.

anyway, onto newer embarrassing stuff.

Today I ended up being an hour early to work.  it was sooo fucked up.  I guess i was lookin at the minute hand on my watch, only.  thought I was gonna be late... fuckin broke the sound barrier (yeah, that was me, guys) just to get to work.  Realized i'm a complete puts.  SOOO... since i had FOREVER til my shift started... I ran to taco bell. holy shit.  that was the most foul breakfast I have EVER had.  two 7layer burritos and a cheese quesadilla (sp?).  the only thing wrong with 7layer burritos is that it's uhmm.. layered-- after you eat the rice and nice textured shit, you have this HUGE ball of lard: refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, and ""red sauce"".   i dunno, the texture of that was nasty.  not good for breakfast.  or at all.  I hate taco bell, i swear, it always leaves your stomach feeling like it's having problems digesting.  which it probably is.  damn, i'm hungry.

Work was real slow.  i got home and wanted to nap.  but noooo i couldn't.  the only time i wanted to nap and had the chance in soooo long.  i couldn't.   it's like havin an erection problem.  bah.  

anyway, I'm outta ultra soy milk.  must go get some.  and maybe dinner.


PS. possibly had the healthiest lunch ever today.  Balance gold bar, a glass of ultra soy, and daily vitamins.  *laughs* yeah, that'll never happen again."

"event","a few days ago erica and i were out and about in downtown portland.  we had our eyes set on a couple of things.... we ended up getting chased by some insane hobo, eating at Typhoon (yum), and going home empty handed.  which was all in all, fun.  we decided to have dessert.. ended up at winco and ran into Amber.  ha.  like 8 times.  so we had some yummy turn overs (rasperberry/apple ones) and ice cream.  sooo good.  we nearly shit out pants cuz tillamook ice cream went back on sale (2.98)... and nearly shit eachothers pants cuz our favorite flavors were the only two that were sold out! 

blah blah blah.

today a friend and I went to watch Shrek 2.  that was great.

well, friday lena will be home.  yay.  can't image what will happen.  but it'll be great.


time for bed, yo."

"event","so.. i made som yummy Pad Se Ew today... and had to resist the urge to make more.. and more...  and thank god i didn't.  but next time, i need more broccoli and tofu.  maybe chicken too.  yuuuum!

so i ran into Ashlee at winco yesterday.  it was so nice to see her.  i didn't realize how much i missed her til we talked for awhile.  next to the bulk food and the seasonal shit.  so i promised to call her.  so i will...  i feel special cuz i had to remember her number.  and uhm... i still do.  odd.  anyway,...


oooh, something embarrassing for me, but hilarious in general--  I was training megan today... and at one of my tables (a couple of 'regulars' i have).. we were talking and gettin their order.  and i laughed.. and ended up snorting really hard (the kind that hurt a little)... and the four of us start busting up.  of course after 10 seconds of laughing, i stop and yell ""SHUT UP!""  and walk away.  very amusing.  eh, apparently i 'made' megan's day.  whatever."

speaking of which... was i the only one in love with ""Mr. Funktastic"" off of bulletproof monk?  he was hot."

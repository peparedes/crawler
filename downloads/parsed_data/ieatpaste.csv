You don't just create compelling stories, you see them as clearly as a movie in your mind.

i went out with gianna for about a year and 3 weeks, but i had to end it because i am losing my mind. not because of her necessarily. just things and life in general. i dont know where to go. what to do. how to do it when i find out. who i am. or who i want to be. i know this isnt gramatically correct, but if you dont like it then fuck you. life is gay.

on a whole other note i spent the last two hours researching presidential candidates. i like hilary, barrack, edwards, and biden. i made up my mind. biden is too unknown. he doesn't have the popularity to make it, even thought he seems like one of the best candidates. hilary is a good candidate also but she is a women and stupid people might not vote for her because of it. barrack was good, but he is black which could also potentially scare away voters. and then there is edwards. he seems really good. i like his view on healthcare, iraq and the enviroment. he is going to be my vote in the primaries. only 7 months away. democrats really need to take it this time. so no fucking around guys. we got congress. now lets get the big seat.

desiree is in town and we have been hanging out like every day. its been fun, and i miss her a whole bunch. her presence is giving me many mixed feelings. she is now married and what not, but we left on such good terms that i kinda feel like it was never over. i love her and always will, but even though i am in a relationship with gianna, who i really like, i am still really sad that desiree is someone else's. i guess i will always have that jealous, possessive, what if? feeling about her. i am just going to enjoy hanging out with her while she is here and hope she iis happy with mike.

"event","Stars is a great band. I love thelyrics.

try as he might he's unable to speak 
he grabs her by the hair, he strokes her on the cheek 
the bed is unmade like everything is 
dark little heaven at the top of the stairs 
take me like that, ruin it all 
then build it again by the light in the hall 
he drops to his knees says please my love, please 
i'll kill who you hate, take off that dress, you won't freeze 

one more night, that was a good one 
one more night, i dreamed it was a good one 
one more, one more night, that was a good one 
one more night, the end should be a good one 
a good one 

he starts with her back cause that's what he sees 
when she's breaking his heart she still fucks like a tease 
release to the sky, look him straight in the eye 
and tell him that now, that you wish he would die 
you'll never touch him again so get what you can 
leaving him empty just because he's a man 
so good when it ends, they'll never be friends 
one more night, that's all they can spend 

one more night, that was a good one 
one more night, i dreamed it was a good one 
one more, one more night, that was a good one 
one more night, the end should be a good one 
a good one"

finally ive been thinking a lot about james. i hate that two-faced son of a bitch. that back-stabbing, pathological-lying, self centered, asshole. i would like nothing more than to kick him in the face until my leg and foot are covered in what used to be his skull. you are probably the lowest-form of life on this planet and i would rather castrate myself with a rusty nail then even consider the posibility that you may not be as much of an asshole as i think you are. and you owe me 20 dollars."

"event","Sometimes i think this cycle never ends
We slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb again
And it seems by the time that i have figured what it's worth
The squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse.

Sometimes it seems that i don't have the skills to recollect
The twists and turns of plots that took us from lovers to friends
I'm thinking i should take that volume back up off the shelf
And crack it's weary spine and read to help remind myself

But if i move my place in line i'll lose.
And I have waited, the anticipation's got me glued.

I am waiting for something to wrong
I am waiting for familiar resolve
I am waiting for another repeat
Another diet fed by crippling defeat
And i am waiting for that sense of relief
I am waiting for you to flee the scene
As if you held in your hand the smoking gun
And on the floor lay the one you said you loved.

And it's strange
They are basically the same
So i don't ask names anymore."

"event","last night kate dropped the proverbial axe. it wasnt a clean kill though. it took a few swings. she has a lot of shit she needs to work ot and the last thing she needs is me piling more on top. i completely understand, even though it felt like she shat on my heart. she wants to ""take a break"" while she works things out, then we can see how things are going. i know from experence that ""taking a break"" is breaking up. usually a girl says she wants to take a break when she A wants to have sex with someone else, or B wants to break up with you gently. both ways suck. i would rather like a clean break up, like a quick stab in the heart, than a long drawn out torture like break up. i do believe everything kate said though. she legitimately thinks we are taking a break. i know better. i know she still likes me though, because she is the first girl whoever broke up with me then had me spoon her."

"event","man. life blows. ive been with kate for i guess 5 months now and i like her a whole lot. this relationship has been the best one ive ever had. shes great and i want nothing more than to please her, but lately i have been in a chaotic job situation in the last 2 months ive had three jobs. all the jobs have been on different hours. so my internal clock has been fucked and i havent been able to hang out with her that much. it makes me really upset. she tells me that she understands and that it doesnt upset her but i know it would piss me off so i figure that she is mad even if she doesnt know it. sometimes there will be things that i want to say to her or tell her but i cant. i know ll probably just upset her or fuck something up. i dont want to fuck this all up like i do with everything else. if i believed in god now would be a time for me to pray. but ultimately i am alone so i have to dig trough this shit solo.

my new job is delivering newspapers. i deliver to retail outlets and newspaper boxes. i needed a larger vehicle for the weekends to fit the papers in. my parents made me get rid of the camaro. for a long time the only thing i liked about my life was my car. i know it sounds weird but i felt like everything else was shit and there was nothing i could do about it but i knew that i always had one good thing. now its gone. my parents made me get a van. a 2006 chevy express. it also came with a nice 500 dolaar a month car payment. 200 dollars more a month than the camaro. i almost cried. i tried to psych myself up about the van but now i hate it and when i look at it i want to scream. i hate my parents right now.

my dad is an asshole who has no sense of reality and i want to move out but i have no money. i need my parents right now and all i want to do is to get as far away from them as possible."

So long!
We wish you well. 
You told us how you weren't afraid to die. 
Well so long. 
Don't cry. 
Or feel too down. 
Not all martyrs see divinity. 
But at least you tried. 

Standing above the crowd 
he had a voice that was strong and loud. 

Ranting and pointing his finger 
at everything but his heart. 

No way
to recall 
what it was that you had said to me, 
like I care at alll. 
But he was so loud. 
You sure could yell. 
You took a stand on every little thing 
and soo loud. 

You, could be, the one, who saves, me from, my own, existence.

Standing above the crowd, 
he had a voice that was strong and loud 
and I swallowed his facade cuz I'm so eager to identify 
with someone above the ground, 
someone who seemed to feel the same, 
someone prepared to lead the way, 
with someone who would die for me. 

Will you? 
Will you now? 
Would you die for me? 
Don't you fuckin' lie. 

You've claimed all this time 
that you would die for me. 
Why then are you so surprised 
when hear your own eulogy? 

Coome down. 
Get off your fuckin cross. 

We need the fuckin space 
to nail the next fool martyr! 

To ascend you must die!
You must be crucified 
for your sins and your lies! 
Goodbye!

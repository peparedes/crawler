My grad party is on the 18th of this month i cant wait until its passed because then i am going to New York....I am sooo excited, I get to leave everything and get away from it all. I have been working so much latley which is good because i have money but the shitty thing is that i spent $155.00 on a damn ticket that i got. But being out of school is good there is almost zero drama around me and that is how i like it. People just suck sometimes and its good that i can just ignore the world almost anytime i feel like it. The weather is awesome too, its sooo hott! I love it sweating.....jumping in the pool and sweating again haha. But yea that is about it .....life is almost care free at this point and im lovin it!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

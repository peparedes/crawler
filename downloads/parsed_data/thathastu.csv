As great as I am with tunes (which is not saying much at all), I'm no good with lyrics (identifying them nor remembering them). Get to the point woman, you might say. Allright allright...I'm getting to it.

I was just humming the song in my head, and the lyrics came out thusly:

We don't need no education,
We don't need no birth-control...
{la la laa la, la la laa laa}
{la la laa laa, la la laa laaa..}

and I thought...wait a minute. Something is wrong here; and seriously. Birth-control? I understand that these people harboured antiestablishmentarian thoughts. Weren't they the enlightened people? People who could think for themselves? People who could make a choice? So what's with the birth-control?

Yes...my mind raced before my memory synapses fired, looped back, and said ""we don't need no thought-control""...my mind wound down just as quickly.

I'm linking here the photos from <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/sundrymatter/UdupiKarnataka2009?feat=directlink"">Udupi</a> and <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/sundrymatter/SringeriIndia2009?feat=directlink"">Shringeri</a>. 

The Udupi photos don't have any captions. None of them move me much, and the things that did move me (the Udupi Krishnan) wasn't available for photographing (where it is not the law, as a policy, I don't photograph the principal deities in Hindu temples). So I'll leave them to speak for themselves. There are a few that could use notes, I'll add them when I get around to it.

The photos from Shringeri however, in my opinion, are the best ones from this trip; even though they don't do justice to the vistas of the temple, the mutt, the view of the night sky from the bridge, or the bliss. The Vidyashankara temple tower is supposed to be an engineering marvel, but I don't know the details, and I'll enlighten you when I'm enlightened myself. Most of my photos are from a place situated about half a kilometer upstream from where the temple is situated. The elephant antics were a welcome bonus. :)

Well, that's the end of my trip to the ghats. Putting that lid was simple enough! Enjoy!"

"event","I had written <a href=""http://thathastu.livejournal.com/25774.html"">a scorching review</a> of Ayn Rand when I was only halfway through Fountainhead. My perception was inevitably skewed because I hadn't finished reading the book. I feel compelled to write this entry in response to some comments I received(offline) back then. 

I finished the book late last year and found that much like running, the first half of the book was the more difficult half.

Full of melodrama, I still find Dominique's character and her histrionics puzzling, but my indignation tapered significantly towards the end of the book. Everyone else (including Roark) seems more real to me. Using fewer words than Rand, let me try to sum up her message -- <i>man is the source of all creativity, and it takes a formidable amount of integrity to be oneself</i>. But things simply said rarely have the same import as a gripping narration embellished with dramatic descriptions and conversations, and so while one may think that what I've said is cliched, he/she may feel enlightened after reading Rand's book. And that, I think, is where Rand's mastery lies.

I still stand by all my comments in the earlier post but, with a generous dose of detachment, I believe now that one can read the book to completion and gain a new perspective on people (themselves included)."

"event","I'd like to pick up where I left off in my last post. 

We were done with our temple sightings by early afternoon on the 31st and were looking for things to do. Our next big destination on this trip was going to be Udupi, which is a few hours south on the coast.

But did I not promise a party? Our definition of a party turned out to be a sunset on the beach! I really wanted to catch sight of the setting sun, considering how it is such a rare event where I live. So we headed to Marvanthe Beach about an hour before sunset. It is situated about 50 kilometres southwest of Kollur on NH 17. The journey reminded me very much of hwy 101 (for those who have been to California and Oregon), minus the cliffs. It was surprisingly clean, and free of certain smells that usually come with city beaches in India. Those intimately familiar with Marina Beach in Madras or Chowpati in Bombay (there are no beaches in bangalore, but Bangaloreans -- think Ulsoor) surely know what I mean. ;) 

I started dabbling with photography somewhat seriously late last year and decided that a tripod will do me good as I have really shaky hands. Sunsets and silhouettes are my current favourite subjects. So I setup shop on the beach, and started clicking away. The resultant album is <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/sundrymatter/MaravantheBeachIndia2008?feat=directlink"">here</a>. 

Personally, I think most pictures are not worth a second look; but I've uploaded them for the record as a checkpoint.

"event","A hello, and a happy new year to my (ir)regular readers.

For those who have been looking at this space with nothing anew for a while, the dearth of anything interesting to share on this blog has kept me from posting. I've thought about a ton of things though, but some topics were more personal than this blog could handle, and others just not personal enough. 

I've finally hit upon that just-personally-right topic, so here I am. 

For those who know what I did in the past holidays, you guessed right...it's a travelog (travel-blog? trablog? tlog?). For those who don't know, I went home to India last December, and went on a tour of the western ghats in Karnataka. This was my first time in the ghats, and I loved it. It was mostly a temple tour, and I present here some pictures from one of our various pitstops.

My Mama, mami, and I set out in the evening on 30th Dec from Bangalore to Kollur. It was an overnight journey through most of the ghat section and the journey itself was quite an experience. We had the last seats in a ""not-completely-insulated-from-the-outside"" bus, which is typically how most Indian buses (and trains, unless ACed) are. Though the ghats are very close to the equator, it does get chilly. The roads being what they were, it ended up being a 10 hr roller coaster ride. As a result of both, I was awoken many times. I'd take a peek through the curtained windows and find that the sky was pitch black, studded with millions of sparkly stars. I caught sight of the big dipper many a time. It was a sight to behold. 

My last napping session ended shortly before dawn, by which time we were so deep into the ghats that one could see only mountains and valleys all around. The sun peeked out from behind some mountains, and we quietly exchanged greetings. The road was unusually rough for me to take any decent pictures and so I didn't try. I just soaked in the crimson red colours of dawn with my eyes till it was too bright for me to do so. You'll find that a lot in the albums. Entire evenings will be missing because I didn't want to be chained to the camera.

Around 6 30 in the morning we reached Kollur, and we set out to look for a decent place to shower before heading out to the Mookambika temple. It was December in India, and it does get cold (though not as cold as here in Oregon) -- but we had a cold water bath (because that's all there was!). It was chilly but awesome still. A hot cuppa chai (and the best ever through the whole trip) later, we set out to pay our obeisance to the Goddess.

It was a small, beautiful temple, built in what I thought was a Kerala style. The temple was unusually crowded for a weekday and I was surprised at that. It turns out that end of December is the time when millions of people flock to an Ayappan temple in Sabarimalai in Kerala. I'll research and write about that another day. Anyway, back to the point...these pilgrims stop at any temple they can find along their way. And Kollur is definitely in the way. As a result, we waited in line for about half an hour before we were able to get into the inner sanctum. There are many legends related to the origins of the temple, and you can read them in the wiki entry <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kollur"">here</a>. It was much hurried for me to register much about the inner sanctum, but I remember distinctly a silver plated snake on the rear wall of the temple. Mookambika sets out on a temple tour twice every day, and we were witness to her morning perambulations. The photos speak for themselves here. I don't have more detail to add to it. At a later (leisure) date, I'll perhaps write more about it.

Among other reasons, I was here in Kollur because I was curious about Adi Shankara. I <a href=""http://thathastu.livejournal.com/18323.html"">believe in Advaita</a> in its most basic form, and this trip was partly an effort to learn more about the person. So right after the temple, we endeavoured to set out to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodachadri"">Kodachadri hills</a>, where there is (yes you guessed right!) another more ancient temple. There is also a shrine of Adi Shankara on the mountaintop (though we didn't go there).

The journey to the hills is where the reality of the western ghats hit me. A friend had once contrasted the western ghats with the US forests, and surmised that though thick, the forests in the US are somewhat tourist friendly, as there are many markers along the trails. I think he was right for, as we were driving to the hilltop, I was able to see nothing but thick forests *everywhere*. If one were to waver from the well-trodden paths, I'm not sure if they'll ever make it back to the right track. That said, I found it amazing that Adi Shankara had almost 1200 years ago travelled the entire length and breadth of India on foot, not to mention the numerous unsung and unheard-of trekkers.

We went atop the mountain on a nearly-unmotorable path, spent some time communing with nature; and turned back. That's pretty much all we had time for at Kollur; and we headed out late in the afternoon. Where to, you may ask. I'll save it for the next post, with a teaser -- we had had our dose of religion for the day, it was now time for some party. ;)

I've put up pictures from Kollur here. I hope you enjoy it!

Fall 2003. My friend G2 and I were at Football practice at the UT stadium (no silly, we were just watching and cheering on.). This was our (at least mine) first brush with this game. We didn't know a thing other than the funny outfit (and a rather funny looking ball). 

To our rescue came Arturo. He sat there on the bleachers with us, and taught us the basic basics of American Football. In return, Arturo was curious about the dot on our foreheads. I personally wear it because...well I think I look pretty in it (so do a few others) and my dad never fails to point out the lack of a point if he ever catches me without it. G2 explained that there are others that believe that they protect one of their energy points (or some such thing) by wearing the bindi.

"event","I found out that Ayn Rand *didn't have* any kids. No...I did not find out by accident. I was halfway through <i>The Fountainhead</i>, and I couldn't continue reading it anymore without seriously affecting my work life.

Some day, I hope to go back and finish it (just like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance...let's see...how long has it been now...6 yrs?). It just became too heavy to be consumed at that point in time.

Yes...at some point during the course of the book I began to wonder...what did she think about kids...and what were her experiences with them. And the burning question -- did she have any? It has been nagging me for the last 4 months now. And I just found out -- none. Interesting. Something inside me feels vindicated. I can't place my finger on why. I do have some guesses:

1) I guess kids can be irrational and needing attention?
2) Something about her philosophy doesn't go well with kids?
3) There's too much adult content in her books?
4) A case of too much objectivity spoils the kids?

I'm in awe of her decision to stick to what she didn't want to do in life.

Mental note: I need to find something that I'll not feel like burning down halfway through."

How am I going to celebrate...I'm thinking about doing what we used to do a lot when we were really young (due to the incessant power cuts AKA load shedding) -- a candle light dinner. 

Inspired by my music guru's family -- who have moonlight, candle light dinners pretty much everyday!

I hope your celebrations are just as fun!

<b>Update:</b> In addition to the aromatic candle light chipotle-leftovers dinner (which was great!), the lights are all also low power now - save one in the closet. There are even these ""natural light"" low power fluorescent lights available these days...and they fit right into my floor lamp, and feel almost like the Edison bulbs too! Woo hoo!!!!

'Twas rather funny celebrating this year...as my roomie was not aware of it and went around switching on every light in our apartment; while I went right behind her and switched off every light that was turned on! And thus balance was achieved. The dinner was quite comedic, if not romantic. ;)"

"event","So I've thought about this, and often. What I'm about to say may gel well with some, and not with others. My sincere apologies to both. Oh...and the disclaimer -- I'm no psychologist, just trying to sort things out in my head.

As humans with some amount of non-volatile memory, we remember things that happened in the past. Some things we tend to remember more than others. They are mostly due to 

a) emotional reactions they caused in us (such as the DSP class that really sucked, or the breathtaking evergreens on I-84), and 

b) others are simply due to the fact that we go back and revisit them every day (like the math multiplication tables we learn in primary school till they are etched in our minds. Wake me up from a deep slumber, and I'll still be able to tell you that 4x2 is 42.). 

My opinion is that most events in our lives evoke some kind of an emotional response. The more intense the response, greater is the tendency to remember it. My theory is that most naturally occurring memories are due to case a) above. Whether it is permanent or not is what is determined by case b).

Now what has all this memory talk got to do with moving on?

Say you had a great positive experience, and it was the best you've had. Now the mind naturally tends to compare every other similar experience with that single best one. It's easily possible that the others are in some way not as good as that single one. And so though these experiences may all be positive, they may still leave a void -- they're not as good. You tend to pine for that good experience again, but you don't get it, and feel frustrated. So positive memory turned negative here.

The second case is the slightly more difficult one to handle. Say you've had a negative experience. The mind works in strange ways (believe me!). It tends to remember that negative experience, and the associated emotion *every single time* something negative happens. Eventually this can sap one's present life.

In either of the above cases, b) above is what is in play. It works to strengthen the memory of that event -- with time there are perhaps even additions and deletions. The memory is vivid, as if it just happened yesterday. The associated emotion is almost a pavlovian conditioning, I think. The event may not have any significance in present day life, but it may still evoke the same response today as it did 3 or 26 years ago. That's what makes me think that it's akin to pavlovian conditioning. This tendency I'd like to think as ""living in the past"" -- negating all events happening in the present, and pining for/moping over things past. Moving on fails to happen.

I'd like to experience the present -- smell the roses and tulips, sing like no man's business, design the best darn network controller there is; make a hot cup of tea, stand in the porch, and watch Spring bloom in front of my eyes. Don't know... may be even dance in the disco downtown. Above all, live today for today's sake.

The past has had its run. I've learned from it. I'm still learning from it.  But please go away. Do not disturb my present day. Denial it is not, an acknowledgment of a great time gone by, a requiem to a really sad day. But please go your way, do not take away my today. And who knows...may be something even better than ever before will come my way!

I don't know about y'all, but I want to move on. And hey (sloowllyy...you know -- everyday)...I am! :)"

I ran into <a href=""http://www.etsy.com"">Etsy</a> recently. It's an online marketplace [quote]<i>to buy and sell all things handmade</i>[/quote].
From their website, their mission is<br />
<blockquote><i>
to enable people to make a living making things, and to reconnect makers with buyers.
</i></blockquote>
I am a great fan of handmade art and craft. Since it is handmade, each piece is perhaps one of its kind. With the mass production of craft (the stuff in target, walmart, ikea, etc), I think individual styles are diminishing. I know quite a few people who are artistically inclined, but left to pursue other careers because of the lack of financial backing and security in art.

"event","It has been a while since I caught up with Tamizh movies (I refuse to acknowledge that month long affair with Prasanna - quite <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808892/"">Kanda NaaL Mudhal</a>, in this entry).

<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034053/"">Mozhi</a> was a great way to break the hiatus. I had a hunch that it was going to be an interesting one when <i>Duet Movies</i> appeared in the opening credits. And my gut wasn't let down. The jokes were simply hilarious, and some still leave me uncontrollably giggling to myself (Or did I catch that from someone I know.).

I've always been a fan of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Raj"">Prakash Raj</a> (who happens to own <i>Duet Movies</i>.), and I was constantly reminded of why. In a land where melodrama and formula are the order; his movies are zara hatke - casual, natural, and oh yes...different. I'm not sure if any of the movies he produced became box office hits. Suthanthira would be a great source for more grub on this guy.

In the second viewing of a pretty decent online rendition (available <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6452932942465933812&q=mozhi&total=167&start=0&num=10&so=0&type=search&plindex=0"">here</a>) (sorry, no subtitles), mom figured out that the lyrics were by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vairamuthu"">Vairamuthu</a>. For those who don't know...he's the Javed Akhtar of contemporary Tamizh movies. For those who don't know Javed either...how about likening him to J.R.R. Tolkein. Would such a comparison be appropriate, I wonder. Their lyrics are simple, appropriate, and somehow profound. 

Allow me to present this song from the movie. I understood a good part of the song when I heard it for the first time. And that makes me quite proud of myself (yes...my Tamizh is improving. My teachers have been very patient with me. But in the same vein, wither goes my English...I know nought of.). Much talk. I must get back on topic. Aah yes. The song. Somebody still needs to translate all of it for me. But here it is.

I want to talk about recycling. What can I say, except that I've always wanted to recycle, but I used to be very lazy about it. A recycling center 15 miles away from home motivated me enough to separate out trash into what could be recycled and what could not...but not enough to make me want to drive to the recycling center, it being just a little too far away. The result...recyclable material would stay with me for a few months, and then end up in the local trash can.

Times have changed since. I now actively separate trash from recyclables, and put them out separately. And now that I live in a community with local recycling (literally 100 feet away from home, yippee!), the last mile problem is finally gone.

Why recycle, you may ask. Although excessive trash makes a great subject for art (check out <a some of href=""http://www.chrisjordan.com/"">Chris Jordan</a>'s amazing works.)...we'll eventually run out of space to put it on earth. I'm not sure I fancy the idea of living on big piles of garbage, not to mention the effects it has on other parts of the ecosystem.

I've been <a href=""http://thathastu.livejournal.com/10844.html"">patient</a>. And patience does pay. With green currency. No, really.

A bunch of us from work drove out to the Oregon Coast last week to hike up the <a href=""http://www.oregon.com/hiking/neahkahnie_mountain.cfm"">Neahkahnie Mountain</a> trail, just south of the <a href=""http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_195.php"">Oswald West State Park</a>. It was after work, and we hoped to catch the sun setting over the Pacific from atop the Neahkahnie mountain.

A good hour and half drive later (which was in itself awesome!), we came to a dirt road. That was a first for me. My car groaned and moaned through all through the half mile drive, but we made it to the trail head without too much trouble otherwise.

Covered in dense foliage, quite unlike my hike in Texas <a href=""http://splogs.livejournal.com/29420.html"">earlier this year</a>, this hike looked very promising. The air smelled fresh, and we were raring to go! Five minutes into the hike though, and i was huffing and puffing like a dragon. Luckily, no fire though. My fellow hikers ahead of me made it seem deceptively simple. A good forty five minutes later, i was almost at the summit. Just when i thought i had made it, i was in for another surprise...a 100 feet ""rock climb"" up the mountain. This was positively scary. I'm writing this post, and so you know i'm still alive. :)

Fog settling over the mountain pulled the curtains on what i'm sure would've been a brilliant sunset. But looking down at the beach sitting atop the mountain...it was peaceful. And that was good too.

In what seemed like no time, it was time to head home. Still woozy from the climb and the vista, my mind lingered. i promised the mountain that i'd come back again, and stay longer. Do you want to go with me?"

<li> I want to go skydiving one of these days, before certain elderly people arrive and tell me how exciting and dangerous it is. I know it is...that's why I want to do it. Oh, them, and Hillsboro weather. (is it 8 yet?)</li>
<li> The world is too full of interesting things. So full that to give a fair amount of time to everything, I should technically be doing, well...nothing! And since I like to be fair...you now know what I do. (Didn't I tell you...paradoxi. Refer to item 2 above.)</li>
<li> I'm beginning to like software engineering a lot. The theory of programming, programming languages, human languages, software design, compilers, distributed systems, distributed programming. And how can I leave it out - computer architecture (it's not really software...but oh well.). All right...I don't know much about any of these things. But I want to learn. And I love collecting books. If you're planning to give away a good book in the above areas, send me a message. Now!</li>
<li> I'd like to contribute to a small open-source project. As usual...everything sounds interesting, so suggestions are welcome. I've never done one before, so small is the keyword. One bite at a time.</li>
<li> I'd like to consider myself as being lucky. Why you ask. Because, in my short life (and it is short I assure u - 4'11"" short! No...we're not going to talk about sideways.), I've met some of the most amazing folk. And lucky precisely because of the shortness - I look up to them. ;)</li>
<li> Oh and oh...Linus Torvalds lives within 10 miles from me. :D. Is it eight already? We're on 9 now. Well...time to go! There's tons more. Maybe I'll write a book - ""A gazillion billion random somethings"", compiled by yours truly (with contributions from a gazillion others; and if you contributed, this space within the parentheses could be yours!!).</li>
</ol><lj user=""splogs""> took away more than half the people I'd have tagged, so I am now having to come up with some people in a wider audience. Okay people...(such as) <lj user=""ittiam""> (thanks for sparing him, <lj user=""splogs"">!), <a href=""http://surelyimjoking.blogspot.com"">divide_by_zero</a>, <lj user=""bloggeranon"">, <lj user=""yawhatever"">, <lj user=""sunson"">, <a href=""http://no-blogic.blogspot.com/"">no-blogic</a>, <lj user=""floopilot"">, it's time for you to go and write something random about yourselves. And that's about all the list I have."

Way back when, a friend of mine asked me (for strictly non-evangelical purposes) - <cite><i>Do you believe in god?</i></cite> (Yeah, this is one of those posts...)
</p>

<p>
This question got me thinking, and thinking some more. After many months of thinking, something hit me so hard that I was affected. For the rest of my life. I'm now comfortable sharing with everybody what it is that hit me.
</p>

<p>
So <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara"">Adi Shankara</a> about a thousand years ago propounded a theory called <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta"">Advaita</a></i>. This is a Sanskrit word meaning non-dual (a = not, dvi = two; in Sanskrit). In its most basic terms, what this theory states is that the paramAtma (the supreme) and the jeevAtma (the living) are essentially one and the same. To me this reads as that the all encompassing spirit is present in everything, including the living.
</p>

<p>
And then there are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin"">Charles Darwin</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel"">Gregor Mendel</a> who came up with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"">theory of evolution</a>. Among other things, one of its hypotheses is that all living beings had a common ancestor.
</p>

<p>
That sultry night in Fall 2001, it felt like somebody turned on a light inside of me. So if the above two theories are right...it means that all living beings must have some part of paramAtma inside of them. Essentially, you and I are one and the same; though we look, dress, talk, feel, and think differently. The tree is a part of me, as I am a part of it.
</p>

<p>
It didn't answer my question of whether there's a master controller somewhere, but for some definition of paramAtma, we are all essentially one. You are I, and I am you. Life changed for me that day in the way I related to people, animals, plants, the sky, and everything else.
</p>

<p>
I just found a way to tell everybody. And so here it is.

To quote Robert Frost would perhaps be appropriate now.

Four women - that's four people, all with perhaps some skill that they can put to good use, and you know - support themselves. And what are they forced to do - make babies. I'm appalled at the rather sorry state of affairs.

And then the baby, against all odds. That's the will of life - which will not bow down to anything. Happy, and cannot help but pray that she has a good life."

"event","As the weather gods would have it, a thunderstorm was ordained in Denver, CO. the day I was supposed to leave for India. And as United Airways would have it, I was delayed in Dallas, TX for a longer duration than my stopover in Chicago before my next flight. The result - a quite unexpected day long stopover at Chicago, and some stunning <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/meensenator/ChicagoMarch2007"">colours</a> in an otherwise quite colourless setting. The patinated lion in front of the <a href=""http://www.artic.edu/"">Arts Institute</a> was indeed as stunning as it looks in the photos. Do forgive the resolution, as the photos were taken on a one-time-use-only camera, and the resultant photos scanned. :)

Folks, I'm not sure if you'd have heard this piece of advice before. But for what it's worth, here it is. In matters of long distance air travel (and I mean across-the-ocean kind of distances), fewer the stopovers, the better. Unless of course, you're in absolutely no hurry to get to the destination. My flight was delayed at every stopover, and took quite unexpected turns (literally!), before I set foot in Mumbai. And in the hustle-bustle of retrieving my luggage, I didn't quite realize that I was home!

Does she retrieve her luggage at Mumbai? Find out about that surprise phone call thathastu gets at the Mumbai Airport in the next entry...

PS: I realize that maintaining a blog is perhaps one of the most difficult things to do, given the forces of nature - like procrastination. <a href=""http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/2002/06/19/blogging-is-a-seductive-idea/"">This</a> insight by a fellow blogger, and a nudge from a friend was what finally got me going."

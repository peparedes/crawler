"event","This friday sucked. I went to school and we had some gay day where we had to lead around little kids to thier classroom, and i had the bratty third graders. At recess there were like 15 kids running after me and jumping on me, the this lil' fucker came up to me and hit me in the balls. I was soo pissed. I started coughing up bile for some reason, and felt nausious for the rest of the day. Then I sent the lil fucker to the office, and he was crying. HAHAHAHAH! he fuckin deserved it the lil' bitch. Then i went skating, and ronan called to c if i wanted to go to the movies. I was like uhhh... ok. Then i went to roanns and tim picked us up, and we went to the movies. Then they got into this kids expedition, and off roaded and hotboxed it. Ronan and i decided not to go cuz it was stupid. That was the wrong decision. I sat around and played snake. gayness. god. Then vanessa walked over and asked if i wanted to go c a movie with her, and i made another stupid choice and said no. I'm a fuckin idiot, somebody hit me. The rest of the night we sat around, until i heard this kid say that christina passed out. I was like holy fuck! I called ann, and ran over towards stephanies, and found out anne was already there. It was sooo sad. Poor girls. That is sum tough shit. When I saw christina i almost cried, and I dont even no her. It was soo horrible. She is just a pretty, innocent girl, she didnt deserve all that shit. Its bullshit. all of it. Ronan and I sat arond doing nothing, except for me calling ann every two seconds, worried 4 her. Then tim called and told me he was street racing. god. So many oppurtunities that i passed up. Im a fuckin idiot. After that, ronans dad came, and he i guess never asked his parents if i could spend the night, so i had to get dropped off at my house with no parents home. Actually, that was kinda chill. I h8 parents. Fuck. My spring break betta b betta. O ya, tomorrow i think i'm chillin wit alissa! god i wanna cut off her nose and fuck her. Shes a hooootttieeee but she has a gigantic nose. FUCK!"

"event","Today was just an average day. I woke   up at 7:00 but i never actually woke up. First perioud was soo sick alex is the funniest fuckin guy ever he is soo hilarious. we just make jokes and laugh through the whole period while everyone looks at us like we're on crack/cocaine. funness. I compliimented taraneh on her cleavage, because she has big tits but there too far apart and i always make fun of her for it. I was chillin with her way back and i layed on her chest and my head fit between her tits. 
(you all now how big my head is) lol. She is wearing bras that are too small now so it squeezes them closer. the other periods sucked including 6th. we watched a video on he gr8 wall of china. Who the fuck cares its a wall! i hav walls in my house! geez. I  fell asleep about 10 or 11 times. PE sucked cuz my knee is like broken and my stupid teacher made me run. I talked to ann 2. She wants a pic. if i giv her 1 she owes me soooooooooooo much. i think i'll giv her 1 tho since she is my best friend. I luv u guyz."

I still hav to write a poem 43 writing about dreams. I'm going to make it all religious and cheezy so the teacher likes it. These tactics work well because it is hard for a religious woman to mark a paper with anything less than a B that contains the name Jesus in it. Last night I talked to Ann 4 a really long time and She still doenst believe me that she is just as pretty as vanessa and alot cooler. But she is! I luv ya ann!

And and steph r soo chill and yet most of ther friends r gay. O ya and anne... Just because youve made out once doesnt mean anything at all guys dont lose any attraction whatsover due to inexperience. Guys dont care. Your a giver thats good. Guys just want anything. All that matters is that your willing to do shit.

Today we had a meeting for torrey and I said something to marisa and the bitch, Ms. Delaney (note: she is a lesbian... no joke! a real live lesbo!) sent me to the office. She made some mean assed comment about how she wishes I grew up. I wanted to tell the fat assed bitch that she should grow up and stop with her detention happy sprees. Shit."

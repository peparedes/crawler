"event","The publisher finally revealed the cover they have designed for my book. I am non-plussed. I told them I wasn't impressed by it, and that I really didn't like it. They basically told me to (shut up and) write and not fuss about the cover design, because they ""know what their doing."" They also said that Barnes and Noble was impressed by the cover and are considering running a promotion of their own on the book when it releases in February.

This is their cover design:

<a href=""http://www.intrepidmag.com""><b>Intrepid Magazine,</b></a> though in it's infancy, is doing well. Still striving to increase subscriptions. Getting some phenomenal writers! Last month's coup was <b>Walter Cruttenden</b> of the Binary research institute. I saw him on a Discovery Channel documentary, <i>2012: Scientific or Superstitious?</i> I contacted him and he send me a fascinating article on Ancient Cosmology for last month's issue.

I just interviewed former Governor of Minnesota, Arne Carlson for this current issue. If all goes well, it will be out by the weekend. Not having a staff, sucks. LOL!

If you haven't seen the mag, go download the free preview issue at the website - it's 74 pages of Politics, Science, UFOs, Unexplained Phenomena and Conspiracies from phenomenal writers all around the world. That;'s one thing my stint with TAPS and the Ghost Hunters gave me... incredible networking.

<img src=""http://stonybrookfilmfestival.com/fest06/images/blind.jpg"" alt="""" />
 
Little-known actor <strong>Chris Pine</strong> has been chosen to play the young Captain Kirk in the new Star Trek movie.
Pine had to turn down a role opposite George Clooney in the film <em>White Jazz</em> in order to play Kirk because of a clash of filming schedules.

Lord of the Rings actor <strong>Karl Urban</strong> will play Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, the Starship Enterprise's medical officer.

<img src=""http://www.fanzone50.com/KarlUrban/KU_1.jpg"" alt="""" />

The film, which chronicles the early days of the Enterprise crew, will be released in the US on 25 December 2008. The movie will show the crew meeting at the Starfleet Academy and embarking on their first mission.

The Paramount Pictures film is expected to begin shooting in November.

Urban's character, Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, was responsible for several of Star Trek's famous phrases including: <em>""He's dead, Jim.""
</em>
New Zealand-born Karl Urban played Eomer in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He also co-starred in The Bourne Supremacy.

The new Trek film, directed by Lost creator JJ Abrams, is Star Trek's 11th big screen outing. The most recent Trek film, <em>Star Trek: Nemesis,</em> was released in 2003.

Some fun news, reposted from the MRF & MNRF listerves.... <i>
(for those of you at Fest, but not on either of those news forums)</i>

I have been asked if I would like to come out and promote my book,
<a href=""http://www.tamohare.com""><font size=""2""><i><b>""The Rollicking Adventures of Tam O'Hare,""</i></b></a> by doing a little stage
show. So, on <b>SCOTTISH WEEKEND - August 25/26,</b> and <b>IRISH WEEKEND -
September 8/9,</b> I - and a cast of thousands - will be performing three
to four shows daily at the Children's Realm Stage.

Adding to the fun for me, are the PEOPLE WHO WILL BE JOINING ME on
stage... <b>John Neitz, Luis Rosa, Dave Potter, Don Preston, Abby & Bryn
Roberts...</b> and a bunch of other people, as of yet uncommitted
tentatively or otherwise.

There will be readings from the book, and reenacted scenes from the
story - including a little swordplay. So if you have some time, and are
inbetween grided shows, or just wandering by at the right moment, stop
and watch for a few minutes. <b>It'll be fun to see you all.</b>

Thanks again to Danielle.

Cheers!
~Scotty

p.s. If you haven't seen the book, yet, and are interested, just take
a peek...

"event","A thread of questions on which I'd like you all to ponder and give comment, if you'd like...<br><br><b>Does the inability to apply the <i>""Scientific Method""</i> to a thing, negate it's existence?</b> Since God(s) (of any faith) is unquantifiable by current science, does that make that god/goddess mere fantasy... or does it simply mean that thing is simply unquantifiable by current scintific method? Is science and the application of scientific method the only meter by which a thing exsts?<br><br>For example, 1000 years ago, oxygen was an ""unproveable"" (hell, ""undefineable"") quantity. Since the science of that day could not apply the scientific methods of its limited scope, did that mean that oxygen was a thing of fantasy? Or was it merely a thing that was, at that time, undefineable and unquantifiable?<br><br>Has Science, elevated itself above Religion, taking on the role of ""The New Religion?"" Is Science the great usurper of Religion?<br><br>Does lack of quantifiable evidence prove that the unquantifiable element is fantasy?<br><br>What are your thoughts...?"

This little quiz was sent to me by a friend... it is written and targeted, obviously, at and for women, but it works...
ENJOY! (be wary of the request for your e-mail... could lead to tons of spam. I used a fake e-mail)...


<b>You are totally over your ex</b>

Your relationship with your ex was meaningful and you learned a lot from him or her, but you've already taken the steps necessary in moving on with your life. You may have mourned for a long time, and you may have been guilty of some not-so-smart post break-up behavior, but you are now ready to get past your old relationship hang-ups and look forward to new possibilities. Maybe it was a new potential partner that made the transition a little quicker for you or maybe you have decided to enrich your life by putting your energy and emotions into something more productive and fulfilling. Whatever your reason for being able to move on, you now feel confident in your decision to never persue that lying sack of shit ever again. Your tend to harbor little to no ill feelings, beyond the norm, and your faith in the possibility of a better, more fulfilling, honest relationship has been restored. You can look back on your relationship objectively, now that you have fully removed yourself from that horrid, life sucking little box, and look forward to life either as happily single or sharing new adventures with someone more honest and complimentary.

Last week, I completed the redesign of my basement, converting it into my very own 15th century-styled Tudor pub. I still have some furnishings I'd like to acquire, as well as the wood floors, but for now, it makes me feel really happy just sitting down there.

I really want to thank my friends for helping me put this room together. <lj user=""warrior_poet05""> most of all.

And, of course, <lj user=""fyery_fly""> was in there troweling the plaster and rollering paint on the walls, as well as helping in all the details. What a great time and a fun project!!

So... how about a little help <i><b>naming</i></b> my pub!! 
Anyone have any ideas...?

"event","...what a woman means when she says she <b><i>""can't find any good men.""</i></b>

<b>Fuck that nonsense. There are tons of good men out there.</b>

I have so many friends around me - not to mention drawing on my own experiences and past escapades - who are seeking ""something better"" than what they have or what they've had.

So, in my reactionary lack of understanding, I have complied a short Top Ten list of what it seems women are actually seeking when they say <i><b>""good men""</i></b>.....

10) must not live in mom's basement (i.e.: must have his own place or place with sane roomies)
9) must have sane family and friends.
8) baggage free - lack of idiosyncratic behaviors (unlike most women seeking said male).
7) must not be needy (fuck... no comment).
6) must not have extra-cirricular friends, hobbies, sports or interests.
5) must not have a past of whoring or sleeping around (no comment).
4) must be a virgin (or damn near close) .... but with experience.
3) must be okay with her <i>*need to be independent*</i>, but emotionally and physically available when SHE needs him.
2) financial stabilty (unlike most women seeking said male).
1) must have six pack and be able to model in a Calvin Klein undies ad.


Feel free to slap me up a bit, or add to the list...."

"event","The first five people to respond to this post will get some form of art, by me.
It will be about, or tailored to, those five lucky ""victims.""

This offer does have some restrictions and limitations:
- I make no guarantees that you will agree with what I perceive as art and/or quality.
- What I create will be just for you.
- It'll be done before 30 days have passed.

You have no clue what it's gonna be. It may be story. It may be poetry. I may draw or paint or photograph something. I may bake you something. Who knows? Not you, that's for sure! I reserve the right to do something extremely strange.

The catch? Oh, the catch is that you have to put this in your journal as well!

Or not. I don't mind if you don't post to your journal.

Also- although the first 5 are guarenteed art, others are welcome to post a request for art. I may or may not get to it."

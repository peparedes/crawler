this is my last public post in a long time. i edited my journal and if you were taken off there was a good reason behind it. so if you would like to be added, and this apply's to anyone, COMMENT HERE. if you comment on another post i probably won't add you cause you obviously do not take enought time now to read my journal, why whould you later?

"event","<P>The humans awoke refreshed and more ready to confront the darkness under the mountain than immediately after facing the salamanders.&nbsp; The strange power of the gypsy is ever near at hand . . . from Edgerton did five of us sleep, and six now stood under the mountain:&nbsp; Neanthyl, Avera, Ravensong, Ogdell, Caela and myself.

The journey back to the hellish scene of our battle with salamanders was uneventful, as was the long walk across the lava.&nbsp; Perhaps a quarter of a mile on we came to an arch, carved intricately as a demonic visage, its mouth open and swathed in blue light.&nbsp; Ravensong heard laughter all about us.&nbsp; I scanned the aperture for treachery, then we moved through the strange veil to see what awaited.

The chamber beyond was polished and black like obsidian, or perhaps onyx.&nbsp; My own eyes do not shine so deeply as this place!&nbsp; The tunnel was as if carved by some dwarven god, perfectly curved arch and clean of anything that might implicate a real dungeon, such as droppings or dust.&nbsp; Several hundred feet down this marvel, a scarlet velvet curtain crossed our path.&nbsp; I moved to edge it aside <EM>ever</EM> so slightly, and the infernal thing parted in the middle and just opened itself up.&nbsp; Thirty feet beyond was a throne of obsidian, upon which was seated a female of <EM>immense </EM>beauty.&nbsp; Her long hair was pale, but more lending to blonde than my own; she had wings of delicate feathers, and her eyes were wells of blackness.&nbsp; She held a sword of glowing, fiery red.

She kindly invited us in, and smiled warmly at me as I greeted her in turn.&nbsp; As she spoke she smiled all around, that winning smile flashing all around . . . and Neanthyl lowered his bow.&nbsp; My prodding and Raven's more forceful tones did not spur a reaction.&nbsp; And Avera began introducing us.&nbsp; And Ravensong fell silent.&nbsp; I did not quite need the warning of magic from Ogdell to see our danger, so I shot the woman Erin with an arrow, and two of my companions attacked me in turn!

As Ravensong attempted to thwart my shot, which landed well in the woman, Avera's blade bit deep into my flesh - that woman <EM>can </EM>swing a blade!&nbsp; Fire burst from my upper arm as I realized the peril I was in.&nbsp; I dropped my bow, rolled out of range, and sprang up to slice again at this misaligned angel.&nbsp; My companions turned upon each other as chaos ensued.&nbsp; I spied several Ogdells shooting a powerful bolt at Erin, but then Avera was upon me, ripping my ribs open with that powerful bastard sword . . . the tears of pain as my breath was all but torn from me!&nbsp; Is this what it is to die, at the sword of a friend?&nbsp; I weaved my way through my pain, failing to land another blow upon this fair villainess as I desperately sought to avoid Avera's blade of rebuke.&nbsp; As I turned towards mine enemy I realized I had miscalculated, as Avera's sword slid in and a gout of blood shot from my mouth in reflex . . . </P>"

"event","This isn't the first time we have been plumbing the depths of the mountain near Tindale when a number of us awoke from a sound sleep in the Caer Falken Inn.&nbsp; It is the first time that I was so awakened by a pot of cold water, however.
As happened the day I earned Shadowslicer from the gnomes, only a few of us were taken from that quest to hear another tale from Cattalinia.&nbsp; For whatever reason, be it the stars, the gods, or her own gypsy purpose, she wished to weave another tale for us.&nbsp; This time, it was of the hunters of Edgerton, who were being slain by a ferocious beast.
It wasn't long before we were in an alpine village, recovering from the gut-wrenching sensation of being hurled across the world by that woman's strange and awesome power.&nbsp; It is by sheer force of will that I don't void myself whenever it happens.
Raven was adamant that we not separate the party (and in wild places I am much more comfortable when we follow her lead, since I don't trust my judgment terribly away from the cities), so we headed to the local pub first to seek out the hunters.&nbsp; If they cannot hunt, where else would they be?&nbsp; And there was a room full of men as large as Marren (who was not among our number for this tale), though less polished than our paladin.&nbsp; They all drank from <EM>horns,</EM> of all things, and I feared that ale would be my only choice to get to know these fellows.&nbsp; There was wine, however, and we ordered drinks to suit our tastes.&nbsp; The glass was somewhat dirty, but the wine mulled and spiced heartily against the chill of the day.&nbsp; All those in the inn made us feel welcome.
We asked about this beast, that, as the barkeep told it, ""rips the very trees from the ground and devours men whole.""&nbsp; The hunters were, however, out hunting, due to drink only in the evening; we sought out the magistrate Ysgil, to whom they had turned for succor.&nbsp; He was milking his yaks, but took time for us.
In the warmth of his house, we asked again about the beast.&nbsp; We were offered cheese and ale (of course) while we warmed ourselves by his fire.&nbsp; We learned that the creature was huge and grey, with teeth and claws powerful enough to rip down anything in its way and happy to devour men alive.&nbsp; Ysgil also acknowledged having no men to spare for their cause, so I offered our services.&nbsp; He indicated that it seemed to live in the pines to the east of the village.
Ysgil offered sturdier clothing to ward off the bitter cold of the high mountains, which none of us turned away.
We soon headed into the frigid wood.&nbsp; The only tracks our ranger Neanthyl first found were of woodland animals and humans.&nbsp; I did not like how visible we were, dark clothing against the white ground.&nbsp; A tracker I am not, but I know a thing or two of stealth.&nbsp; My own complexion would have blended in to the surroundings, were I willing to expose myself to swift death at the mercy of the elements.
Before long we found a lone cabin in the wilderness, and debated whether a witch were within, as Ysgil had mentioned one that lived in the woods and made infusions.&nbsp; We knocked upon the door.&nbsp; It opened to reveal a vile, stinking man whose manners were <EM>almost</EM>&nbsp;as offensive as his odor.&nbsp; Clearly not a witch, he offered no aid on that count.&nbsp; As for the beast, it had eaten four of his men, and&nbsp;he pointed us in the right direction.&nbsp; His manner was as offensive as his odor, and I was glad when we were far from him.
We continued northeast from the cabin and the land leveled out somewhat.&nbsp; Neanthyl and Caela discovered strange tracks . . . Neanthyl some unusual deer prints, and Caela that of a barefoot human.&nbsp; We determined that the human tracks were more likely odd, so we followed them.
The tracks led to a tree and no further, vanishing.&nbsp; Lost in a snowstorm?&nbsp; No, it had not snowed.&nbsp; I spotted another oak, fallen in the snow, about eighty feet beyond it.&nbsp; Raven had ascended the first tree, and followed my gaze, drawing her bow as she did so.&nbsp; It seemed further investigation would be our only chance for another clue.&nbsp; We found the tree was split asunder, with bootprints and signs of struggle.&nbsp; Clearly the place where this tale actually had begun.&nbsp; We were starting to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and if we assumed that the tracks went <EM>into</EM>&nbsp;the tree, then the droplets of hardened sap made more sense about the battlefield.&nbsp; I was starting to suspect those offensive hunters to be liars and brutes when we heard a crash, and ran to meet the very creature of their nightmares:&nbsp; big, gray, hairless, six-eyed, large black teeth.
The way it bellowed made it seem like it was angry at something other than us . . . but it was <EM>us </EM>that it attacked, with first blood on Avera.&nbsp; There was no time to puzzle out this riddle of the gray render, as Caela marked it.&nbsp; We nicked and battered it while it used its full strength upon our only human companion, Avera.&nbsp; What had those hunters done?
We finally fought the beast to ground, trying even as we did to find a way to stop the fight, for we all felt we were missing something.
At that moment did a unicorn appear among us, and heal the beast so its wounds would not kill it.&nbsp; Both Caela and I tried to speak to it in the language of the wood, assuring it we had no choice, when the unicorn was shot at by arrows.
We turned as one to see the hunters that sought to slay this magnificent beast.&nbsp; It all made sense now.&nbsp; Protector and protected.&nbsp; Hatred of humans.&nbsp; Stench.&nbsp; Death.
I&nbsp;thought I was wise to lay aside blade for bow.&nbsp; There was no reason to get in Ravensong's way.&nbsp; I know her to be a barbarian, a grugach, to have a background and knowledge completely unlike my own.&nbsp; I did not know what true fury she has held within her for all the time we have traveled together.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was at first&nbsp;pleased that I did not impede her savagery by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.&nbsp; I am in awe of the beauty and fury she has within her.
Her first blow tore open a hunter's chest.&nbsp; The fates dealt her a blow; the sword that retaliated flashed with magic as it did its worst.&nbsp; I think the flash as it hit harmed her more than the steel itself.
In disgust I tossed my bow aside.&nbsp; This was no way to fight, whilst they were in among the foe!&nbsp; Shadowslicer in hand, I danced to her aid.&nbsp; The foe was dropping quickly, but I managed to sever life's blood from the pig that threatened Ravensong.&nbsp; The final cur tried to flee, but Raven dropped his worthless carcass with barely a shrug of her great blade.
Shockingly, no sooner were they vanquished then she herself near collapsed under the weight of her wounds, as her battle-rage which had sustained her deserted her frail frame.
Even as we worried about getting her to warmth were we back in the Inn by the fire.&nbsp; Why it never harms my stomach on the way home I cannot say, but we and all the ill-gotten gains of the hunters were there.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we were safe, warm, and wealthy."

"event","So the portcullis door was solidly down, and the only way out, it seemed, was down a pit.  I simply <i>adore</i> choices such as these.

	Marren was able to move the altar stone, but it was sturdy enough that the ropes of Neanthyl and myself could be anchored to it.  The pit had no walls to speak of, spreading out beneath us, so climbing was not an option.  I didn't like the idea of anyone going down without armor, so I suggested we all focus on lowering Marren, then each could follow in turn.  The stalwart paladin warned of evil below, but what could be done?  That portcullis was not to be lifted!  Wisely, he armored himself further in his faith 'ere he descended.

	No sooner had we lowered his gleaming form to the chamber below was he beset by foes.  Raven nimbly skipped down the rope so that he would not be without allies, and each of us in turn descended, lastly Avera, who brought the rope behind her as it gave way from the altar, causing her a rather hard landing.  Below, we were fast surrounded by a dozen doglike creatures, breathing fire.  We quickly got to work.

	The fight was vicious.  The flames and teeth were unkind, and Avera fell in battle.  I managed to trick one onto my blade, but was forced to focus more on preserving my own skin than perforating that of my enemies.  The blades of Ravensong and Marren led the way in dropping our enemies; Marren was then able to infuse Avera with enough holy energy to reawaken.  More healings came from Marren, who seems to have an unlimited supply of scrolls . . . he deals death, and then grants life moments later.

	Our path was irrelevant; both tunnels looped back past pools of lava to rejoin at the juncture of a larger passage.  This one led to a bridge over a veritable <i>lake</i> of lava.  I was still quite wounded, so I maintained an inconspicuous watch, and saw several red and black reptilians gliding on the lava towards us.  Gliding on molten rock.

	Some of us took to our bows against this foe - Neanthyl and I often share strategies, as we approach battle in similar ways.  I will have to learn more about that silent fellow.  At this time, though, our arrows softened foes who fought with the heat of their flesh as much as with weapons.  I remained hidden and shooting, though Neanthyl and Avera moved to close along with the others.  I could ill afford another wounding!

	The salamanders all fell, but more wounds <i>were</i> taken.  Our last healings were spent, and we agreed that the party must rest, or all would be lost.  We retreated to the spot where the pit let us out.  There was an alcove nearby which we made into a camp for the night (if night it were . . . so hard to tell underground).  I envy the humans their need for sleep . . . they seemed to truly enjoy it."

"event","I can't say I understand the motivations of Cattalinia, but four of us awoke in our beds at the Caer Falken Inn when we thought we were about to face battle . . . 

Marren, Ravensong, Avera and myself found ourselves wandering down to break our fast, as befuddled as we could possibly be.  Raven in particular seemed more tense about this obvious show of magical power (though I expect this of her; she's never taken to spellcraft), though Marren also seemed quite distraught.  Maddy had no answers for us, though Ferghus mentioned in passing (and I should have been expecting it) that the gypsy had plans for a morning tale.

Her only answer to my inquiries was that the stars were not aligned for that particular fight.  In its place, she sent us to the gnomish town of Goldwarren, or rather, the town that had been built to replace it since they had been driven from their homes.  Our hosts offered to reward us for ridding them of Ginats (as they called it) and its pet by providing us with better weaponry.  Despite more misgivings from Ravensong, we were blessed by their priest of Tor (the god that, apparently, had sent word ahead that we would be arriving) and delved into the recently-evacuated underground town.

It took very little time to find the troll (which is what Ginats was) and its pet otyugh (a well-deserved label) and slay them both.  We were barely through congratulating ourselves when screams called us from without; a hill giant had decided that gnomes aboveground were gnomes worth stomping.  That one took a bit more effort, as its hide was tough and the tree it swung did not hit lightly.  As I did before, I hung back and shot my bow - Avera, after being pummeled, took up the same tack.  Only Marren and Raven closed for long with the monster, but we did bring it down.

The gnomes allowed us what the giant carried - a fair amount of gold and gems - and gave us weaponry as well.  Ravensong received a greatsword called Limbhacker; Marren a longsword named The Sunstone, and I was given a rapier known as Shadowslicer.  Avera hadn't produced a weapon for the gnomes to inspect; she received a Ring of Prowess to aid in her fighting.  They also presented us with gold and pyrite necklaces that marked us Gnomefriend.  All went dark after that . . ."

"event","We've clearly moved from kobold territory into goblin warrens.  These tunnels don't seem any safer for the goblins than they are for us, however; a number of them were dead around three large, flaming worms (thoqqua, Ogdell tells me) that seared Ogdell and Raven both as the paladin led in the slaying.  Goblins aplenty sought to down us, but fell easily.  Ravensong found in her scouting another acidic blob; this one splits when it's struck and of course it burns with every strike.

I'm beginning to miss to kobolds."

"event","No secret entrances into the mountain were found, so we again went into the mine Jacob had abandoned.  This time, however, we did not descend that lift into the lower levels.  We considered it, but found it trapped by the little buggers.  Since there were tunnels we had not explored, we determined to find areas where we might be less expected.

We had a wonderful opportunity to set up an ambush, for we heard a band of kobolds and quickly hid ourselves - all but Marren, who stood his ground and defiantly announced his presence.  Had things gone my way, they would have rushed past us to strike him down, and we would have denied them the chance.  However, my companions are quite martial and impatient, so although we did kill each and every one of them, the desire for stealth was ignored.

I do not understand those who rush headlong into battle when just a small amount of finesse will save much spilling of friendly blood."

"event","Quite a merry band it is that I lead into danger this day.

<b>Caela,</b> mistress of the greenwood.  With an eagle her constant companion, this half-elf is skilled in both the mystical and practical aspects of the wilderness.  Her wisdom is fast showing itself to be vital to our success, and I take her words seriously.

<b>Neanthyl,</b> so solitary and quiet he makes <i>me</i> seem noticeable in contrast.  His elven eye is sharper still than Caela's when tracking prey, and fine with a bow as well.  His skills are as important as my own to keep us all from ambush.

In contrast to Neanthyl is <b>Marren,</b> human paladin of Solaris.  Though he <i>seems</i> somewhat tempered by his recent fall and atonement, his heavy armor, strong voice and fearless demeanor make him a lodestone for evil.  His joy in vanquishing enemies might only be matched by that of

<b>Ravensong,</b> savage beauty of a wild elf tribe.  I do not understand her unbound ways that seem to revel in fury, but I find her exoticism somewhat alluring.  She stands two hands over my height, a giant of our people, and wields her greatsword with impunity.  Marren and she have developed a rivalry measured in the bodies of our enemies, one which has attracted

<b>Avera</b> to the game.  This human warrior has tricks I never imagined, and is whirling death despite having neither boundless rage nor divine favor.

Somewhat different is <b>Ogdell,</b> a wizard whose vocabulary is far greater than his spellcraft as yet.  I have kept the tensions betwixt he and Raven, which were not the lighthearted jabs she shares with the paladin, to a minimum.  His large words frustrate her and his magic terrifies her.  In truth, I know that in time, Ogdell may be the one who holds <i>all</i> our lives in the balance.

Despite my fond approbations of my colleagues, we all but ran, tail-between-legs, when last we faced the kobolds in the mines above Tindale.  Their numbers are endless and our resources were low.  Now we return to face the ""unspeakable evil"" which it is Marren's quest to destroy, traveling through a wilderness infested with malice (on half-day this trip alone we have faced dire wolverines and a pack of ghouls, whom the rangers agree are only the tip of the iceberg).  I now have a bow, Ogdell has learned to harm as well as inflict naps, and our paladin is restored.

I pray it is enough."

"event","Where to begin...well I was drunk last night, big surprise, and I felt the need to call like everyone I know, even people I don't talk to or don't like. To make a long story short I called this senior in my public speaking class. Her mom answered and being the the fag I am, I said I was another kid. Now, I didn't say this to get him in trouble or be a dick or anything, I felt that it was just a good idea at the time I guess, and this wasn't even a prank call, I just felt like talking. Anyway, today in class this girl gets up in front of everyone and decides to anounce it and that I said I was Marcel, who's a fucking beast and now wants to kick my ass, I almost want him to, i need to feel pain right now. So he gets all in my face and I'm still hung over and feeling sick with my head down on the desk and get this, then Christina Waldbauer who I cannot fucking stand starts running her mouth about how like if i call her she'll call the cops or something? I never called her and I never will, I hate her (which I said  to her when she threatened this by the way). Then, Mrs. Turner promptly starts yelling at me and saying how that if I harrass people she'll get involved and tell the police and administration or something, I don't know what the fuck any of these people were talking about and before I knew it the entire class was yelling at me. GOD, I wanted to cut so bad and punch someone or something. I snapped, I dunno what happened but I lost it, I haven't felt overly depressed in like a year and I've only cut once in a year and 1/2 but all day long I thought about killing myself and cutting, not that I would kill myself and I didn't have anything to cut with. I don't know what happened, if it was because of that whole phone thing or what, but I lost it, the rest of the day I was trying to hold back tears and trying to resist hurting myself. Like when I got home I sat on my bed and thought about all kinds of shit, and what bothered me most is that I have nothing going for me. I thought and thought, and came up with nothing. I suck at sports, I'm not strong or hot, my closest friend, like somebody who actually doesn't mind hanging out with me outside of school is a senior, nobody my age can stand me or wants to hang out with me unless it's a party or show. I'm so fucking pathetic... I'm ""smart"" but I don't apply myself in school so my grades are shit, like it's a waste, I'd rather give my brain to a kid who trys hard but has a disability, I don't deserve it. The one and only thing I could think of is that I'm good at history, but who cares? History is a pointless subject anyway. Like all the time I'll do something stupid or ""funny"" and kids will laugh ""Wills you're crazy!"". But now I get it. I'm not funny, they laugh because I'm pathetic, it's like laughing at a clown, I'm just a joke. They're laughing AT me, not with me. The truth it, I wouldn't mind it if I died tomorrow, I don't think I want to, but I wouldn't be that pissed, I'm a burden on everyone from my parents and brother to teachers and ""friends"". I don't hate myself, not at all. If I was somebody else and knew me, I wouldn't hate me, I'd just think I was a pain in the ass. I'm dissapointed with me. Like, if I could only start over like at 2nd grade, when I moved to Mendham, I'd do everything so differently. I'm so tired of being Wills the druggie, I hate the person I am, the person I've become. I hate drugs and alcohol, it's how I escape and I think ""I'm Wills the druggie and to be the person, to be normal and fit the part, I have to use drugs."" Of course I don't think this concieously, but ugh, I dunno. Why am I even writing this shit down, I never read it, nobody else does, hell, nobody else fucking cares or gets it. I guess what I'm trying to say is everyone would be better if i was gone, maybe I'll run away? Whatever, I need some  time to think about this shit and  self mutilate, bye.

"event","It's been a while, and as usual nothing has happened so it doesn't fucking matter, not much does... I've spent the last 2 hours playing on partypoker.com kicking major ass, but then I lost the connection and now I'm too lazy to log back in. I'm no longer talking to Lizzie,it all dawned on me yesterday how fake she is an d how hard she is to deal with. I don't feel so good, I hope I'm not sick... my little cousin was sick and was around her so ya. Oh ya I went to St.Louis for grandma's 75th, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Of course, she was a bitch as usual and all but I chilled with Jenna most of the time and went thrift shopping and shit and it gave us time to talk. I never knew how cool she was lol, my mom always talks about her and Jeff and how I should get strait A's like them and shit. Jeffs gunna be a brain surgen or some shit like that, and Jenna wants to be an art teacher. Well ya so I was talking to Jenna about shit and it turns out shes pretty badass lol, not as preppy and perfect as I thought. I had alot of fun just talking about random shit with her and telling stories, I dunno, for some reason it was funny talking to my cousin about drugs and what-not when I've knwon her my whole life.

     I'm getting decent grades, hoorah for me! I have a C+ in math, which is RyDyKuLoUs considering how much I suck at it, and I'm getting B's and A's in the rest of my classes except drivers ed. God, that class is such a drag, Attonito is the worst teacher ever, he simply doesn't know the information, and he gets MAD when we correct him, everything he says is totally opposite from the manual! The worst part is that he looks like a frog and has these huge bulging nipples that you can see through his nasty spandex clothes. So anywho, I joinged the track team...HOLY FUCK DUDE, I was like dead after the fucking warm ups. I thought I was gunna puke and got really dizzy, i dunno why I let Jamie talk me into joining it. After practice I worked out with him, bad idea. I'm so fucking weak man, I could only bench the bar but, in my defense, its one big fucking bar haha. I did some other shit too that I don't remember but ok that was thursday, now it's saturday and I'm still mad sore. It was pretty sweet though, afterward we got food and shit and hung out a while. I did a speech on Aqua Teen Hunger Force in public speaking and we watched a few minutes of it, everyone in the class was so confused and horrified lol, especially Ms. Turner, dude if you could've see her face! 

    The parade is today and as usuallllllll dad wants to go to that stupid party,and I'm gunna chill with Ariel this weekend, so brilliant me thought up a plan. I'm gunna see if Ariel wants to chill today after the parade, that way I won't have to go to the after party! I'm so smart! Have you ever had like an itch in your ear but it's not because of wax, just because god hates you? Ya, I have that right now and it's driving me to the fucking brink!!! Wow, I'm so ADD right now. I'm gunna go shower.

"event","Wow, my life is boring. It's been three days and nothing worth writing about has happened. Well actually no, I beat San Andreas which is friggin sweet, and Lizzie is coming over tomorow. I need to get a hobby, I haven't played guitar at all in the last couple of weeks, drugs and alcohol are take up all of my time. This senior went to rehab for coce this week,COCE IS SO GAY!!! I almost think I should, but then again hell no, rehab's a joke. I guess the best thing is to talk to my friends, which at the moment is a short fucking list. I went to both of my doctors today, all they did is bitch at me but hahaha, I had my hood up and little did they know that I was listening to my Ipod, and with the hood up they couldn't see the head-phones, I'm so cool. Oh nice, adult swim is on!! (everyday but friday at 11:00 PM, ch. 47)

      I dunno, I'm so depressed and like theres nobody I can talk to about it, like NOBODY and it fucking sucks. God the truth is I wanna do drugs more so that I have friends again, as stupid and cliche as it sounds. When I stopped smoking and wasn't alowed to go out, I grew apart from them. I miss them, they were my first REAL friends... I dunno, everyday it gets worse and I don't wanna start cutting again, it's a pain in the ass having to wear long sleeves all the fucking time even when it's hot. Whatever, I'm out.

"event","Today was awesome/horrible. I say this because I have no fucking clue. I slept through every morning class as usual, but I also slept through every afternoon class which isn't. I got plenty of sleep but I was still dragging all day. God, I need drugs or SOMETHING! I'm just so bored of life and everything, I don't mean I'm suicidal, I'm just generally bored. I lost $15 to Colin in poker, but made it back, I owe him $5 now, will I ever fucking learn? Probably not. I may get a job at the Mendham bakery after school a couple of days a week, depending if I Jamie still wants to do Spring track. I need to do one or the other, I do nothing after school except get drunk/sleep/play video games/masturbate/talk on the phone or any combination of them... I really need to get a life. Maybe I'll play hockey or practice satanic worship...on second thought that's way too creepy for me, showering with guys after practice *shudder* lol just kidding.

       I'll prolly chill with Cav or Lizzie later this week, or maybe play poker with Jamie, I'd like that a lot. I've been playing a lot of cards lately both at school/home and online and despite my ass whooping today, I don't do too bad considering I've been diagnosed with addictive personalities. I can't wait to be 35 slightly balding, addicted to heroin and booze, living on the street begging for money to fufill my gambling and drug/alky habbits. I wonder if I'll ever get married... 

       Seriously though, I need to get a fucking hobby (besides drugs and alcohol) Maybe I'll start a band. We would suck but it would give me something to do, it works for Chaffee right? hahaha  But for now I guess I'll have to continue my current hobby of  and yelling at my mom about random thing such as the color of my hair when I'm plastered. I really should stop drinking considering it runs in like 95% of the people on my dad's side. I was a little messed up in Public Speaking today, so fucking fun. Ms. Turner looked at me as if I did the exorcist head spin! BLAH, I dunno, now I'm rambling, I'm gunna go get drunk now. :)

"event","Today was my bday, it was pretty good. I was woken up at noon by the phone ringing...it was Lizzie. We talked for like an hour about shit and she told me some stuff that was going on in her family. Rachael is the one who said I hooked up with Megan, and I guess it was understandable why she would get pissed if her best friend told her I cheated on her...so I forgave Lizzie. We're not together, we're ""on a break"" I guess. As for Rachael, I'm not going to talk to her for a longggggggggggggg fucking time. That's so dick of her to do...like wow, and what's WORSE is that she denied it when I asked her if she said that. W/e, one less person I have to deal with, I've decided that THERE'S TOO MANY HUMANS!!! Oh, I've also decided that masturbation is a waste of my, although not precious still pretty important, time. I think I'm gunna stop until further notice. Anyway, Colleen and Justin came over around 5:00 and gave me 2 cd's for my birthday, one of them I had already but it's all good. My mom made her homemade chocolate cake with iceing, fucking delicious! I didn't eat dinner, and now that I think about it, all I've eaten today was a few pretzels and a piece of cake. I really need to gain some weight.. I weigh like 105 lbs and have like no meat on me. I look like one of those holocaust survivers. God, I'm going to hell for that one. 
       
        Argh, I'm so ADD tonight. At 8:00 Cav, Ben, Dave, Kayla, and Lia along with Colleen, my mom, Ryan, Me, and Justin went bowling at Pastime. Yeah I know, gay, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Cav was blazed and was pissing my brother off, it was pretty funny. Cav and I kept pressing that ""ball stuck"" buttons and the guy was all confused when there were no balls there (haha, no balls there...get it? wow I'm gay) I can't believe I'm fucking 16. I got like $300 today, so all in all, today was a good day lol. Yay, Adult Swim is on!!!! Holy shiznite, I love The Venture Brothers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Channel 47 at 11:00, check it out, all the cool kids are. I didn't drink at all today, wow, and you say I have ""a problem"". Did you know that a long time ago, if you swore, depending on the severity of the word, they believed you killed baby angels. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK! God I'm suck a fag, I'm gunna go to bed before I say anything else stupid.

"event","Well it's February 6th, my birthday!!!! AND I FEEL....like shit.I wanna get drunk. Kaylas party was fun, all I did was keep ben company after he puked eveyrwhere and stand outside next to the fire smoking cigs. God, I'm such a sketchball fag. Oh, and I walked in of Greg and Cristine fucking, not a pretty sight. Forte and some other kids were smoking and I wanted to so bad. Like at that moment with the whole Lizzie thing, me cutting again, and having to watch Cait and Gabe making out all night, I just exploded. I wanted to cut but couldn't find anything...and I wanted to get high but nobody had any weed left, I was so pissed. I think I'm going to start doing drugs again, more then on ocasion. Shit's bad right now and I'm tired of tryting to hide my feelings and my cuts. TEENAGERDOM SUCKS! I'm watching the most fucc\ked up animae right now, some talking blue robot and some girl with scuzzy purple hair, I dunno. I found out that Lizzies in the hospital, I feel like a cock now. There's something wrong with her heart, it could be serious. I thought about what to do all night, Cait noticed I was sad and talked to me for a while...and it actually helped, she was really sweet. I miss her...is that wrong? AHHHH somebody help me, I'm losing my fucking mind!

"event","Last night Jamie and Megan picked my up to go to a show at obsessions at like 8:00. We ate peanuts and did shots of rum in my driveway, which was very refreshing after a shitty week of school. The show wasn't  gay as I thought it would be, The first band sucked ass but Edgels band was fucking crazy as usual. After their set jamie and megan told me they were leaving, and being that they were my ride, I had to go too. Instead of taking me home, they invited me to get some food, since i had an hour and 1/2 till my mom got home, which was really nice. We drove to the mo-town diner and met up with some girls that megan knew  and later john and another girl came. It was great, I haven't that much fun in a long fucking time. 

    Today lizzie was bitching at my saying that like i was making out with megan or something?? I don't know, i really dont give a fuck if she thinks that, so I bitched her out and basically dumped her...and I feel surprisingly relieved. Tonight I'm going to kayla's party which should be fun, I'm almost positive that she likes me so maybe we'll hook up or at least get fucked up, either is good haha. I dunno, I really needed this weekend cuz I've been so depressed lately and the worst part is I don't know why. Maybe because of Lizzie? i started feeling really depressed like the week I met her...coinkydink? who knows. Aren't girlfriends supposed to make you happy? Rachael said something interesting to me the other day. She said "" It's not Lizzie you want, it's a girlfriend"". That sounds logical...maybe it WAS the fact that I had a girlfriend and not just a fuck buddy, (cough, cough, cait, cough)and it makes a lot of sense to me right now. I dunno, w/e. we'll see what happens.

<b>I think just being moody made me act all upset and stupid crap. I realy can't explain it, but Nikki said it pretty clear in a post below this one.</b>

<b>So lately, all I have been focusing on is my job and getting as many hours as I can, because my rent is $375 a month, and I got to pay my phone bill on top of that also; I know I can afford it, but I need to save my tips for food, toiletries, etc..This time, I'm going to be prepared when I move, unlike the LAST time, when I kind of got thrown into the whole thing, and I got screwed over in the end. That won't happen again.</b>

<b>Also, I think I'm going to focus on my weight thing. Being 160 is not something I want to be anymore...I know I have a lot of muscle, but I want to have a firm tummy.</b>

Anywho, I dont feel good and I have no life. my best friend's 21st is Thursday. Im going to go drink my sorrows away because I cant stand my Bf. he is tearing me apart and Im tired of it. 

Blah, enough of my rambling...heres a new poem I wrote not to long ago:


<b>Feelings</b>

<b>too many thoughts going through my mind
are you really the one for me, or was i just being blind...
by lust; you had me for months
i dont know if this is working for me..</b>

<b>do you even give a damn about how i feel
or is flaking some sort of new deal?
saying one thing to me, then doing a fucking other?
im not going to deal with this bullshit any longer.</b>

<b>im sick and tired of being the ""good girlfriend""
im going to rebel sooner or later if shit doesnt
come to an end.</b>

<b>you better see how it effects me in one way or another
because if you dont change your ways, im going to go find me 
another lover.</b>

<b>so take this little poem into consideration
because if you dont, our relationship will be a 
total obliteration.</b>

And Of COURSE, it is to my bf.

I miss you guys who are on here...<3"

you all need to get lives and try to at least unglue yourselves from the PC.

it seems like every single one of us is trying to live a life that is unreal...and don't try to say that isnt true becaue that would be a lie.

why be friends with someone you know you will never meet...or at least met once?

It makes no sense to me now....


I guess the only people I actually like to keep in contact with on here are the ones that I have known since I was 15....you know who you are.

the others...well if you have a life outside this three diminsonial box, then so be it. I love you too because you dont rest your lives around fucking ignorant people on a computer.

Nowhere to go, Nowhere to hide...
Massichistic feelings start to appear inside...
My mind is racing with fear of rejection
Heart over soul is like the feelings of tension...I get when your presence is near
But only when I see you, I start yo lose my fear...of pain that I could sense in the air
Whenever you walked passed me and just stared.

How do I go about his.
Why can't you just see.
My heart is racing for you, like a crackhead on speed.
My life is a waste, I don't know why...
I feel the way I do inside
But all I know is I'm going to try...
To have you in my arms for just one night...
To hold you there and never let go,
And tell you everything that you want to know


Nobody.

Nobody knows.
Nobody cares.
Mixed up emotions turn from smoldering
to flare.
My head's gone mad
The fibers are unraveled and
My heart is fluttering so bad.
Killing me inside..slowly.
Nobody knows.
Nobody cares.
Killer instincts...twisted thoughts
Suicidal tendancies..no memories lost.
Murderous...scandalous...FUCKED UP
Individual.
Nobody knows.
Nobody cares."

[Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring"

[Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from

[Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like mates to soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type, I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So whats required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

[Chorus]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO!

[50 cent]
Em introduced us, ""50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?

Here's a poem I dug up from the depths of my computer..i forgot i had it..i remember i wrote this when i was faded:

Nobody.

Nobody knows.
Nobody cares.
Mixed up emotions turn from smoldering
to flare.
My head's gone mad
The fibers are unraveled and
My heart is fluttering so bad.
Killing me inside..slowly.
Nobody knows.
Nobody cares.
Killer instincts...twisted thoughts
Suicidal tendancies..no memories lost.
Murderous...scandalous...FUCKED UP
Individual.
Nobody knows.
Nobody cares.

Don't ever fucking question that (6x) 

Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights, 
to place you dangerously close to that sun, 
enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore 
and recognize the cause of what's done is done, 
more than enough to put my name behind my ideals, 
and neglect my logic twice daily. 
enough to keep me looking for my lucy in the sky with gems, 
when I remember how you used to call me baby, 
enough to look in my mirror with detest for every tear you shed regardless of 
why you wept, 
enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth of the ocean i swam 
till i ran out of breath. 

I love you, don't ever fucking question that, 
that's why we'll probably never get along.

I love you, I love you (faded) 
never, don't ever fucking question that, don't ever fucking question that. 
riding the public transit, 
I study the blank stares to answer my questions of how and why I got so many 
grey hairs. I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord, 
and I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord. 
single file lines, to give her a pound one at a time but when i faced her- 
I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine, 
I awoke from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me to 
submission and I still walk with my religion. 
I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror, 
worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer. 
hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin, 
gassing' me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within, 
for every eclipse that stares at me from the other side of a paper cup of 
espresso- 
I light a match beneath a kettle, 
and for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program 
to seek success, i bleed my ethics out a slow drip. 
I used to know a man who met a woman, dont remember where, 
big beautiful eyes and light brown hair, 
she was from the burbs, he was from the south side of the city, 
this was back when Franklin avenue was still pretty. 
two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town- 
we all know how people like to get down. 
here we go, aquarius, pisces, 
feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul. 
bush shoved the cane without the glove numbed the pain. 
the magic from up above what it does for the brain, 

make the love, paint the picture, write the song, the player met a virgin 
made a virgo named him sean. 
make the love, paint the picture, write the song, the player met a virgin 
made a virgo named him sean. 
make the love, paint the picture and write that song till the break of dawn. 

I love you- don't ever fucking question that, that's why we'll probably never 
get along. if I was better at finding the right words to say, I wouldn't need 
to write these mother-fucking songs.(2X) 
I love you (make the love, paint the picture, and write that song [in faded 
background]). I love you.. I love you.."

Ah ha, Houston, Texas (This is the way we ball)
Ah ha (This is the way we ball)
(This is the way we ball)

[Chorus]
And we like to floss, all my diamonds gloss
I represent the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty South
(This is the way we ball)
And we ridin blades, Jags and Escalades
We third coast boys but we always gettin paid
(This is the way we ball)
And we like to floss, all my diamonds gloss
I represent the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty South
(This is the way we ball)
And we ridin blades, Jags and Escalades
We third coast boys but we always gettin paid
(This is the way we ball)

[Verse One]
I'm Lil' Flip, I'm back on the scene, freestyle king
Brand new piece, same byzentine
I'm still sippin lean, I'm still watchin ""Scream""
I love wearin platinum, but my favorite color's green
I'm hoppin out Ferraris, my house is three stories
I'm still independent cause Jive couldn't afford me
The meetings were boring, for real I was snoring
The VP was fine, yeah she made me kinda horny
But that's another story, let's get back to the topic
Right now me and Hump negotiatin to buy the Rockets
We might buy the Comets - name it, I done it
If you see it and want it, buy it, own it
This is for my homies, Pat and DJ Screw
R.I.P. dawg cause I really miss you
Boy I'ma stay true, until the day I fall
East coast and West coast, this is how we ball

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I'm thinkin - designer clothes and fashion shows
I'm thinkin - all my albums goin platinum and gold
I'm thinkin - Jaguars and a Bentley Rolls
I'm thinkin - bein rich before I'm 24
I'm feelin - wood grain all in my tinted truck
I'm fillin - all my teeth up with princess cuts
I'm fillin - jugs up, no mo empty cups
I'm feelin - like I'm worth 10 million bucks
And I know - I wear a watch, yo it was made from a game
And I know - my rims chop like the blades on a plane
And I know - yo baby mama still givin me brain
And I know - that ain't platinum, that's a silvery chain
And I make - nothin but hits when I step in the booth
And I make - rainbows from the sun reflect on my tooth
And I make - DVD's light up in my coupe
I think I feel I know I make money, how bout you?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I'm swangin, about to rip the kizzerp, sippin on my syzzerp
If you buy first from me then you just bought a dizzert
Swangas on my whizzeel, platinum in my grizzeel
Me and Doby D stay blowin on some kizzeel
I'm higher than a hizzeel, mind on a mizzell
Southside of H-town show me how you fizzeel
Now you see we ball, now you see we rich
I represent the legendary Screwed Up Click
I wreck I-45, I wreck 2 Screw tapes
I'm 3 wheelin, poppin trunk, goin down Fuqua
So move out of my way cause I'm ridin double R
MJ right behind me in a Lexus bubble car


Man, I love this song."

"event","My Week has been nothing but boring..except I think I may be getting back with my baby..

Hurray!

I came to the conclusion that I'm disgusted a some people for moving too fast..is it cause of me being pissed, or are you just that stupid?

In my eyes, I think people under the age of 21 shouldn't have kids because they are too dumbfounded for their own good as it is...it should be illegal.

I miss Ricky..I haven't talked to him or Jamie in awhile...well, since like yeaterday, but it feels like forever. *sigh* I hate the internet, but the damn thing keeps drawing me into it...YOU EVIL BEAST! 

I miss talking to Coveted, but I don't want to feel week like all the other girls he fucked over...oh well, there all a bunch of dumbasses anyways..I was just lucky that I never showed him anything freaky on cam or anything like that...I'm one of the smart ones. I just have to say that he was a awesome person to talk to when I needed to talk. Thanks for that much..but for all the shit you said about me...I don't know wht to think. I know I said shit too, but there are limits, and those lines were crossed. I am NOT anyone's groupie...I don't care if I have a big forehead and I don't care what others think of me phisically..If I'm ugly to you, then that's fine, but I think I am beautiful in my own eyes and that's alot to say comming out of my mouth. I just wish other people saw me for my inner self, and not what is on the outside.

Anyways, enough of my rambling..I'm out.

Peace."

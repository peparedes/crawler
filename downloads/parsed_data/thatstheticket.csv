"event","well so i just read some critiques on the movie Harry Potter 4. the people saw a private screening of it in London.

major negative points
1- they dont show the qudditch world cup game...the first 200 or so pages in the book is condensed into 10 or 15 minutes of the movie
2- ludo bagman is not in the movie
3- veela are not mentioned...leprachauns play tiny tiny tiny role
4- winky is not in the movie
5- DOBBY is not in the movie (yeah i know what youre thinking.) Neville Longbottom is the one that gives Harry the gillyweed instead of Dobby
6- the tagline on previews ""everything is going to change"" is not even a part of the movie
7- the movie strays from the book so incredibly much
8- no dursleys 
9- ron plays significantly smaller role

major positive points
1- Dan Rads acting has improved greatly and there isnt a single facial expression that is not believable
2- Emma Watson is beautiful and outshines everyone in the movie for her acting
3- Ralf Fiennes (Voldemort) is awesomely terrifying
4- Patrick Doyle (composer) makes John Williams scores seem boring 
5- the special effects are top notch

one critic said that as a movie..HP4 receives no less that a 144 out of 10. but a miserable 4 out of 10 if you are foolish enough to compare it to the book.


well you know i am excited. poor dobby."

hall day was today, i should have been a pirate. god, i hate hindsight.

tommy was hook and brad was peter pan. ryan s. was rufio. kaleena and catty were the crocidiles that saved the day! whoo hoo!!
there was a brilliant display at lunch. to make a short story shorter...everyone yelled for hook. so hook came out of the lunch line and dueled with peter pan. then rufio came to save pan and got killed in a swordfight with hook. then hook got eaten by the crocs. all in front of 1st lunch onlookers.
and there was a wonderful re-enactment after school


last home game is tonight. last performance as a drum major ever. hmm i would be sad if mr ralls were director. i would be very sad. but since mr nettles is director, i really dont care. and not caring is equally as sad, i think.

The Race

I can still remember that bleak day in December.
There was a sort of wintry-warmness that filled the air.
Then suddenly, out of nowhere, that horrible phone call came, 
and all we could do was stare.
My grandfather ran to the phone so quickly you would think it was a race. 
On the other line, a woman spoke sweetly and the muscles tensed up in his face.
He threw down the receiver with anger in his eyes.
He knew where we had to go, the hospital he despised.
We rushed to the car, speeded fown the road. 
When we reached the hospital, we ran as fast as our legs would carry us.
Grandpa spoke to a woman and tears streamed down his cheeks.
I knew what was wrong and my legs collapsed over my feet.
I was on my knees and began to pray.
I prayed it wasn't true, and prayed to re-do the day.
Grandpa lost his wife and sorrow stuck his face,
he knew he had lost that race.
It's a race against time when someone dies.
Your body feels weak, and your heart cries.
I can still remember that bleak day in Decemeber.
My heart cried.


--- so i thought it was pretty good! although my grandma died in July so i don't know what that whole December thing was about. kinda weird.

Loneliness

I saw loneliness clearly.
She was feeble and frustrated.
She turned and begged me to stay with her.
I saw her hollow eyes and pale face.
I heard her pleading for company,
And I felt sorry for her.

----i like the last line...dunno why. keep in mind i was in 9th grade.

I'll put more up tomorrow or something.

today has been a not-so-good day

Instant Star is really good. it comes on Noggin. if you watched So Weird on Disney you would recognize the main character. she was the blonde girl that was only on their for a couple of seasons. she took the place of the brunette girl. and they would have her sing on the show a lot and stuff....well she sings all the time on Instant Star and she is pretty amazing now actually. she has red hair now and it looks freakin awesome. but the show is really dramatic and makes me cry every time i watch it. 

still no suicidal thoughts but today was a really bad day and i just wish he would come home."

so i guess now i just have the true knowledge that i dont fit in with that group anymore. i guess i should have known.
closure is good i guess

But all is well mostly:

i miss ryan of course but i am holding up fine. no suicidal thoughts as of yet.

Friday the marching band went to Emerald Point and it was GREAT!!! well mostly...except for the part when i spent 15-20 minutes by myself waiting for someone to walk by that i could hang out with. that part sucked...but other than that it was AWESOME!!!

so many painful wedgies...

Mr. Marks has a hilarious sock tan-line...and he was wearing a very cool shirt. 

I was told to take Tinky(the band's mascot...a stuffed animal) to the water park..and so i did and was yelled at for not feeding him. 

no band until tuesday. sweet."

KILLING DUMBLEDORE?!?!?! WHO IS STUPID ENOUGH TO KILL OFF DUMBLEDORE!!!
J.K. Rowling you are losing your touch I say. I wonder if she knows how
many children are going to be truly messed up in the head after finding
out Dumbledore dies. Now the book is just going to be too scary.<br>
<br>
AND HARRY ISN'T GOING BACK TO HOGWARTS?!?!? ...well we know he
will..cause no one would want to read the last book if he didn't. <br>
<br>
okay i have a theory. So Snape killed Dumbledore. And if you've read
the book you probably think Snape is an evil ass right now...(and if
you haven't read the book you shouldn't have read below that line up
there anyway...) HOWEVER...Dumbledore assigned Snape a task at the end
of the 5th book i think. might have been in the 6th, i get them
confused. but the point is, we never really found out what that task
was. When Snape approached Dumbledore...Dumbledore was defenseless. He
had no wand and he was on top of the Astronomy tower and he was
cornered. As Snape approached him, Dumbledore said, ""Severus..please..""
......NOW--- that could have meant ""Severus..please..no.. DONT KILL
ME.""&nbsp; orrrrrr....""Severus...please...finish out the task i have
given you. kill me now. sacrifice me so that harry can go on alone and
kill Voldemort himself as he was destined to do. because if you ask me
he is being a real wimp right now and needs to stop crying to me and he
needs to go try to destroy him on his own. I am an old man and i am
just too damn tired...so kill me.""<br>
Now even though the book said that Snape had ""a look of revulsion and
hatred in the harsh lines of his face...""&nbsp;&nbsp; that COULD mean
hatred for Dumbledore...or hatred for himself for killing the man that
trusted him enough to let him teach at his school. HOWEVER...(i am
sorry i am rambling..) that theory sort of doesn't completely
work...cause Dumbledore told Harry in the 6th book that murder is
something way too horrible for words...so then i guess he wouldnt ask
Snape to commit murder if he felt that way..<br>
<br>
WHEW!!<br>
<br>
okay i am done i think that was more of a rant to try to make myself
understand what i was thinking. i doubt anyone even read it. oh well.<br>
buh bye<br>
<br>
OH YEAH!! And Snape being the Half-Blood Prince....total shocker. i thought it was Voldemort the whole time!<br>

i went. i am glad to be home so that i can see my friends and
especially Ryan, but i am sad because montreat just makes me feel
important to the world for some reason. i love it.
<br>

i am going to have a very long entry because it is going to include

PLEASE DO READ IT!!! AND COMMENT!! :)

<br>
Sunday:
<br>
-my packet said that we were leaving from ""the lower parking lot at
8:00"". so naturally my mom and i assumed that meant the lower parking
lot of Quaker Memorial because that's the church i went with. but there
was no one there at 7:50 when we got there. so we freaked out. we went
to the gas station so i could use the phone and call beccie....no
answer. we freaked out even more. then we went back up to the church
and by then it was 8:05 or so and we saw a van in the LOWER PARKING
LOT....whew..i guess we were supposed to BE THERE at 8:00 :)
<br>
-registered. found out i wasnt in Drama but Beccie was. it was sad.
<br>
-first worship service. our pastor/minister/preacher was SCOTTISH!! how
awesome. his accent was really cool and i think he is in his 50s but
even so..what a hunk. but that must have still been the accent.... but
seriously...his name is John Bell and he is just one of those few
people in the world that seem to have an inner light and inner peace
within themselves and they are just so close to God it is amazing to
everyone surrounding them. and he preached barefoot...like Jesus...cool
:)
<br>
-he taught us the ""Amen"" song that he wrote. because he is amazing and
writes songs. but he taught it to us part by part. like soprano, alto,
etc. and as he was teaching us..he sang it and conducted it but he
moved his hands as is he was placing each note on a musical staff. he
leaned to the side sometimes and if our notes were wrong he wavered his
hands. it was wonderful. he is brilliant.
<br>
-saw Sam, Jonathan, Myra, and Laurel whom i met two years ago. they are from Tennessee and very awesome.
-Mixer...YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! star trekkin'

<br>
<br>
Monday:
<br>
8:00-Drama. me and katie/catty snuck in. we did this walking around
game where we couldn't bump into anyone. it wasn't drama, it
was...recess. but i liked it :) beccie hated it and never went back.
luckily katie/catty went with me.
<br>

<lj-cut text=""Probably the most important occurance of my life..."">
<br>
<br>
It was our last one and so we were taking communion again. Bell made
some brilliant quote about how if you are looking for Jesus, you can
find him here at the table. so people started taking communion and this
guy walks up onto the stage and talks to bell and then bell looks
astonished and bewildered and he takes the guy's head in his hands and
starts like blessing him or something. so then i started crying. by

then time i had to get up for communion i was shaking TERRIBLY. when i
was walking down the aisle i felt like i could puke at any
second...literally. i could have, but i didnt. the guy gave me the
bread and looked really concerned because i looked TERRIBLE and
definitely wasnt breathing normally. but i unsteadily dipped it into
the wine (grape juice) and stuffed it in my mouth. i felt like puking.
i walked back to the pew..still bawling and shaking...and i sat down.
then i saw another boy go up onto the stage. i asked beccie what he was
doing and she said that she guessed he was being blessed or
something...after i heard that i KNEW that i needed to be up there. so
i stood up and stepped on people's feet while getting out of the
pew...i pushed through people coming back from communion and stepped on
more feet....still bawling and almost regurgitating. i went up the
steps and walked up to Bell. he came over to me slightly and bent his
head down to say whatever i needed to say. but i didn't have anything
to say. nothing. so i said ""i dont know. i just..cant stop..crying..""
and he looked past me because obviously i was UNBEARABLE TO LOOK AT
;)...and he said in his Scottish accent...""okay. well..do you love
Jesus?"" :::nod::: ""Do you want to be his disciple?"" :::nod:::
""okay..well that's all the matters then."" he took my head in his hands
and said stuff. who knows what it was but it sounded
fabulous...especially with all of my sniffling to enhance it.
when he finished he gave me a hug and i snotted on him...and then he
took my hands and i squeezed them and said ""thank you."" more bawling
followed.
Helen told me that it took guts to go up there but i think that i
wouldnt have had any guts left if i hadnt. they would have been on the
floor.
so yes i just shared a very very very very personal experience with
whoever wants to read this but for some reason i want to. i want
everyone to know. afterward i left a message on ryans cell telling him
about it and then i called my mom. i was STILL crying...
:) </lj-cut>
<br>
Thank you John Bell
<br><br>
<br>
-me and beccie hung out with jonathan. he told me that he thought i went up on stage to profess my love for john bell. wrong.
<br>
-it rained really hard so we went to take shelter in the huckleberry.
sam arrived drenched and gave me the mayonnaise that i have ALWAYS
wanted. thanks so much for that sam. beccie, liz, hunter, tyler, and i
played egyptian rat screw and didnt finish cause we had to leave.
<br>
-Finale concert. i wanted to find john bell so i could thank him again.
so i asked the director of the conference where he was and he said he
hadnt gotten there yet. so when he got there i went up to him and he
saw me and smiled a little and i said ""i just wanted to thank you for
earlier today"" and he said ""oh, well you are welcome.."" then i hugged
him and released and said ""i am going to start crying again..."" and he
said ""well you know, i was crying up there as well. it is a very
emotional thing. thank you for coming up there."" then he grabed my
hands and i said ""no thank you"" and we parted.
<br>
-concert. wahoo.
<br>
-after the concert i found bell again and waited for a free moment for
him. when he saw me come up again he chuckled and said ""hello"" and he
smiled a smile of recognition which was cool. i said ""one more thank
you"" and he said ""oh..okay."" ::hug:: then i said ""i'll never forget
you"" and he said ""oohh i'll never forget you either."" i said ""thank
you"" and we grabbed hands and he said ""goodbye"" and i said ""bye"" and he
smiled. YAY!!! i made a Scottish friend. and he really did touch my
life. more than he will probably ever know. and it is making me cry
writing about this so... the end.
<br>
oh but i had a tattoo on my arm that was a heart with a bell in it and
then it said john. i hope he didnt see it. actually no i hope he did.
it's funny. <br>
-me beccie and katie/catty got invited to a party at some house near
the convocation hall. i didnt think we were going but then sam and
company invited us as well so we went. there was dancing..which i did
not do. but there was also benedict who is 15 and a glorious singer and
just cool in general so we hung out with him.
""I am really hungry! Did I eat dinner??....yes..ok...good. i did.""
<br>
-we sang phantom together.<br>
-time to leave so we walked halfway back with Sam and Company + Andrew
who is very tall. but we had to part ways so we said our goodbyes and i
was picky about hugs. sorry. i dont like back pats..it just makes it
seem like the person doesnt want to be hugging you. -some guy from Sam
and Company asked for my phone number. i said no. he then tried to
escort me but i declined. until we went down a very steep hill, then i
gladly used him for a railing. but after then i steered clear. i guess
i used him?? :(
<br>
-then me, beccie, katie/catty, and briana ran back to the house cause we were late
<br>
-we did our Skit where we made fun of things that happened over the
week. such as the household obsession with john bell. actually more of
the CAMP's obsession. we bought his sermons and keynotes. and a CD of
his songs.
<br>
-they loved the skit.
<br>
-bed

<br>
<br>
Saturday:
<br>
-we left. and i asked tyler to get my cereal. and it was in the stow
thingy under his feet and he couldnt get to it so david turned around
and helped him and yelled at me really angrily saying i didnt need
cereal and cussed which he shouldnt do and his face turned red and i
pulled my pillow up in front of my face and he said ""oh great shes
gonna cry again"" which i guess he was referring to the only other time
i cried..at worship on friday.
but i did cry. cause it was scary.
<br>
<br>
HOME.

<br>
<br>
I am going to put a quote from Bell's sermons or keynotes on here each
time i update. they are quotes that particularly stuck out as deep or
important to us and we wrote them down as he was speaking. should have
gotten his autograph...you know he is quote famous in Scotland.
<br>
<br>
anyway, the quotes will be the Subject..so you have already seen my quote for today."

<br>
<br>
it is weird being back home. i really love montreat. i am so glad that
i went. i am glad to be home so that i can see my friends and
especially Ryan, but i am sad because montreat just makes me feel
important to the world for some reason. i love it.
<br>
<br>
i am going to have a very long entry because it is going to include
many details from the entire week. bear with me...or dont read it. BUT
PLEASE DO READ IT!!! AND COMMENT!! :)
<br>
<br>
Sunday:
<br>
-my packet said that we were leaving from ""the lower parking lot at
8:00"". so naturally my mom and i assumed that meant the lower parking
lot of Quaker Memorial because that's the church i went with. but there
was no one there at 7:50 when we got there. so we freaked out. we went
to the gas station so i could use the phone and call beccie....no
answer. we freaked out even more. then we went back up to the church
and by then it was 8:05 or so and we saw a van in the LOWER PARKING
LOT....whew..i guess we were supposed to BE THERE at 8:00 :)
<br>
-registered. found out i wasnt in Drama but Beccie was. it was sad.
<br>
-first worship service. our pastor/minister/preacher was SCOTTISH!! how
awesome. his accent was really cool and i think he is in his 50s but
even so..what a hunk. but that must have still been the accent.... but
seriously...his name is John Bell and he is just one of those few
people in the world that seem to have an inner light and inner peace
within themselves and they are just so close to God it is amazing to
everyone surrounding them. and he preached barefoot...like Jesus...cool
:)
<br>
-he taught us the ""Amen"" song that he wrote. because he is amazing and
writes songs. but he taught it to us part by part. like soprano, alto,
etc. and as he was teaching us..he sang it and conducted it but he
moved his hands as is he was placing each note on a musical staff. he
leaned to the side sometimes and if our notes were wrong he wavered his
hands. it was wonderful. he is brilliant.
<br>
-saw Sam, Jonathan, Myra, and Laurel whom i met two years ago. they are from Tennessee and very awesome.
-Mixer...YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! star trekkin'

<br>
<br>
Monday:
<br>
8:00-Drama. me and katie/catty snuck in. we did this walking around
game where we couldn't bump into anyone. it wasn't drama, it
was...recess. but i liked it :) beccie hated it and never went back.
luckily katie/catty went with me.

<br>
its been a while hasnt it

<br>
<br>
well school is over, ryan graduated, i am senior<br>
<br>
everyone is excited about being a senior, i think it sucks. it is a year full of college  and scholarship applications. boo.

<br>
<br>
last sunday i went to ocean isle with ryan and his family. they dont do
nearly as much as my family does, but i still had fun. the one night we
went out to eat wasnt very good. the food was okay. but i had my mind
set on crab legs. darn. <br>
<br>
but since that night was <font size=""5"">THURSDAY, June 16th</font>...which was me and ryans<font style=""text-decoration: underline;"" size=""6""> 6 MONTH ANNIVERSARY!!!!</font>....<font size=""3""> we went to the Pavilion in Myrtle Beach which is like an amusement park. i got some dip n dots...happy anniversary to me : )<br>
<br>
plus it was definitely a happy anniversary considering that me and
ryans bedrooms were connected by a bathroom...and we had our own
bedrooms. yippy skippy there was definitely a lot of sneakage and we
went a week with very minimal sleep. 

<br>
<br>
MAJOR EDIT: being able to wake up in the morning with him beside me was the greatest feeling in the world. he is so special to me and i wouldnt trade our relationship for anything. i screw up so much in our relationship and yet he sticks by me. i dont deserve him, and i tell him that all of the time. he just says he knows...he says i deserve better. there is no better. he doesnt know how amazing he is. and he deserves the best in the world...i just wish that i could be better sometimes. he deserves so much more and he doesnt even realize it. god, i am so lucky. <br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

"event","I PASSED MY HISTORY SOL!!! i will love david ashwell forever too, because he passed on the good news to me. HALLELUJAH!!!! (sp?) i didn't get advanced or anything like that but I DONT CARE!!!!!!! in fact, i only passed by 54 points :)
Ashley Coles got a perfect score
David Ashwell only missed one
dang

me and amanda did our POW interview on sunday. we were there for nearly two hours. it went very very very well :) HOOWAH! i am so glad we got it over with...now we just have to write the report :(

my sister is married now. she got married on Saturday to Nick King and now she is Wendy King...a mixture of two fast-food restaurants. Wendy's and Burger King. lord knows i am the only person who would think of that..
the wedding was nice. i cried. i also forgot to give her back her bouquet at the end... :( she got it eventually though!!

congrats to Ryan Tenny for playing the piano at my sister's wedding and being amazing at it

cool Gas-Guy talked to us during Chem 2 today. he played with fire :)

Mr Woodford tricked us the other day. he said he would be leaving soon to go to Rome for a few weeks and that he wanted us to come with him. and the cost was very cheap and we didnt need any bags. so we were like uhhhh...and turns out we are watching a powerpoint on Rome. so clever

did i mention that i passed my history SOL? i am so happy. mrs gibson gave me a sheet of paper that said my score and stuff..and i taped it in my locker :)
we are watching Schindler's List tomorrow. cool :)

i am happy.

except for the part about how i am worried to death right now.
i called ryans house and his brother picked up and said ryan couldnt come to the phone so i was like ""okay well tell him stephanie called"" and he was like ""ok sure""
so then like 10-15 minutes later, the phone rings and the caller id says tenny. so i was like ""hello"" all perky-like thinking it was ryan...but then the voice was like ""stephanie? this is deb tenny, ryan's mom how are you?"" i was like ""uhh well im doing good. how are you"" and she said ""oh im fine. ryan isn't feeling well at all right now. we just took his temperature and he has a fever of 102 so he is in bed right now. i dont think he will be at school tomorrow.""   ...""ok""...
""yes, well like i said he isnt feeling well and he just asked me to call you back for him. why dont you try back tomorrow, hopefully he will be feeling better.""...""ok thank you""...::hangs up:::
:::pulls hair out in the agony of worrying that my boyfriend is dying::

see if he had called back and said he was sick and couldnt talk but that he wanted just to tell me that he wasnt dying..that would have been cool
but since his mom had to call FOR him, it seems like it's something bad.

i dont know..im just venting"

"event","OMG. i hate it how people are saying the History SOL was easy. i was crying and shaking i thought it was so hard. not to mention i couldn't concentrate at all because brad and justin were just carrying on a very casual conversation after they finished...which was very soon after they started.

i got 5 right. that's a lot less than 34 -- which is passing.
so cool guys, i may have to take Gibson's exam. AWESOME! it's an old APUSH Exam...complete with DBQ and two essays. if i can't pass the SOL, how the heck could i pass that?

so my sister gets married on Saturday. you'd think i would be excited. i'm not. cause i am nervous. i have to fix her trane! and i have to sing at the reception for karaoke. i am only nervous cause ryan will be there but still...blllaaahhh.


and me and amanda are interviewing David Harker the Vietnam POW for history on sunday. this is going to be such a stressful weekend. I CANT WAIT!!

my mom told me i might not go to school tomorrow cause she might need my help preparing. but i am going anyways. cause i chose to. i am such a loser for CHOOSING to go to school. but i want to see the English commercials :)"

"event","ok so i haven't talked about my classes in a while so i guess i will do that..

-creative writing is boring and if you are planning on taking it, be warned of its boringess 
-latin is the same as above, only woodford is slightly more complex than zuidema. my teachers have weird names.
-chem 2 is awesome when i understand it. and it is fun when i understand it.. as most things are. but right now i don'tl, so..to hell with chem 2. but not mrs. cornelison cause she is really nice.
-math is just easy. the end.
-AP History sucks. not taking the AP Exam is the smartest decision i have ever made in my life. but taking the class was the dumbest.
-English. damn it damn it damn it. i hate english right now. i wouldn't hate it so much if mrs. llewellyn were teaching but we have freaking Patrick and she looks like a mongoose!! i don't like her. she assigns way too much work. it just all piles on top of each other. we did poetry a long time ago, like last 6 weeks and we still haven't had the test on it. so now we are doing a research paper...which is due wednesday  by the way and I haven't started...so i don't know when the heck that stupid test is going to be. we haven't had one on Modernism either. she is stupid. i like llewellyn so much better. 
-Band. stupid Baghdad. 
-SODA. stupid 6th graders. they all want to be black.

my cat is being a huge snob lately. she keeps peeing on the clean towels in the laundry room  whenever she wants something. but she jumps up on the shelf and lays on the towels and just pees on them. so then we go to grab towels to take a shower and, i dont know if this happens to anyone else in my family, but about 5 times now i have gotten out of the shower. grabbed my towel and started using it. then when i dry my face off, i smell cat pee. and then i get grossed out because well..who wants to use a towel covered in cat pee? so now i have to smell my towels before using them.
she is such a snob. and she keep clawing at my laundry basket and jumping on top of my canopy. she is annoying the crap out of me.

ERGGHHH!!! florida. I HATE FLORIDA. Ryan is going to college in Florida and he leaves August 12th or 13th. damn it.

my favorite cuss word is damn by the way. i told my mom that once. 

last weekend i went to Baltimore with my mom to see my cousin perform in her cheerleading competition. i was so happy. i walked into the room and saw cheerleaders on the stage and i just couldn't contain my excitement, it made me really really happy. it was like Bring It On :) :)

so my mom got a rough draft of the Variety Show CD and it sounds really really good. normally i hate listening to myself sing but i don't mind so much this time. 

i think i am getting fatter. which sucks because prom is soon and i have to be able to fit into a dress that i tried on months ago. it won't get here until May 4th so there won't be any time to shop for another one.

what a long entry. 
i hate florida.

second of all --  MY ENTRY TO MOVIEMISTAKES.COM GOT ACCEPTED!! i enter them all the time and they never get accepted!!!!!! i entered it for Saw and YAAYYY!!

 Continuity: When Dr. Gordon is in the parking garage, he stops walking momentarily, and there is a flash of light behind him. We later learn that this flash is actually from Adam's camera. But when Adam is telling his story of following Dr. Gordon, a picture comes onto the screen of the doctor in the garage, but it is a close up of the front of his face. However, earlier in the movie, the flash came from behind him. Adam could not have taken a picture of Dr. Gordon's face from behind him.

don't believe me that it's actually on the website?!?!  
i'll prove it!!!

"event","tennis match tomorrow
woot woot
i don't really care if we have it or not.

I WISH TOMORROW WAS FRIDAY!! all of my teachers are assigning so much work right before spring break. i wish they would just assign it OVER spring break...but you know they have other work planned for that ...

so this WAS going to be my Spring Break:
-Saturday -- work
-Sunday -- absolutely nothing
-Monday -- same as above, and then my doctors appointment where i get my HEPATITIS B SHOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :( i am scared
-Tuesday -- nothing
-Wednesday -- nothing, until 8, and then ryan
-Thursday -- ryan
-Friday -- ryan
-Saturday -- work, ryan
-Sunday -- nothing

but NOW it might be this:
Saturday - Monday -- same as above
Tuesday -- drive up to New York
Wednesday-- see Wicked
Thursday-- drive back
Friday-- ryan
Saturday - Sunday -- same as above

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!!! Wicked or Ryan, Wicked or Ryan. if you really think about it, if i go to New York i can still spend time with Ryan, just not as much. but still some..
if i DONT go..i dont get to see Wicked at all and i get to see Ryan for 2 more days.

DAMN...i am torn"

"event","seems to me a trend lately so i will do this too

My life lately seems to me going so well, but then again so badly --
 
+ getting to spend an average of about 2 and a half hours a day with Ryan
- having to be away from him for 21 and a half hours a day
+ i got into symphonic band
- according to mr ralls, it is likely that i will be 3rd out of 4 chairs
+ CASEY MADE DRUM MAJOR!!
- lots of people think i rigged tryouts
+ the cast party was fun
- the cast party was a little TOO fun
+ tennis is fun
- i am in exhibition AGAIN
+ i have great friends
- sometimes they are just so rude
+ mrs llewellyn was so incredibly impressed with my VS performances that she bought me the Les Mis book, a box of sprees, and she gave me a card with a really thoughtful note written on it
-  ....it's kinda weird.
+ i got to play with lauren today in tennis
- we had to stop after 5 games :(
+ i am falling very deeply in love with my boyfriend
- he leaves for Florida on Saturday, and may even possibly go to college there in 4 months :(
+ THE VARIETY SHOW WAS GREAT!!
- it's over now, and i really miss dancing
+ Mr. Ralls is back
- he is even more uncooperative than i remembered


There are more but the only minuses that really bother me right now are the ones involving ryan...
but i swear to myself and all of you that my journals will never be as sappy as Heather Bryan's. I PROMISE!!!

but i love you Heather :)"

the variety show was everyone's best night for everything. though i liked last week's Les Mis better. but oh well. phantom was my best one ever.

Cast Party was full of drunken-ness. enough said.

everyone was quite laughable. especially hannah. and amy. 
 
today was a day of sorrows and regret...followed by happiness and love

the end :)"

"event","well i haven't updated in quite a while. I HAVE BEEN UBER BUSY

tues-rehearsal
wed-rehearsal
thurs-show
fri-show
sat-show

oh and can't forget those SAT's. the writing part was easy but the math and reading stumped a few times. especially the reading, which is odd. and i am sure i will be taking them next year.

so me and beth cooper were in the multi-purpose room tonight before the show and we were talking about what a huge jerk ryan is. because he said that he probably wouldn't make it to any of the shows because he had to work on weekends. and i knew he was off saturday (tonight) and so she said ""so the one night he is off, he has a birthday party instead of coming to watch you?"" and i was like ""you know..good point. what a jerk""
 so then when i was changing in the bathroom, she runs in and says ""hey stephanie, guess who is here"" and i was like ""oh god. dont tell me"" because it makes me nervous when i know who is here. i'd rather just not know and perform to the black emptiness.
 but then she said ""i was in the lobby and i looked outside and saw ryan there and he brought everyone from his party""
...damn. sorry about calling you a jerk.

WOOT WOOT the show was great. les mis was pretty good except the stupid GATE!!!! fix it fix it fix it. phantom was good but not as good as last night. 
a lot of my family was there.

HOORAY FOR RYAN!! what a guy

sleep tomorrow :)"

"event","Thanks to everyone who showed to the party, I hope it was to everyones standards. (Except Troys cause he showed up late, again...)  A nice showing of people. 25.  Thanks to the few who donated. 4. 

I was expecting a bit more from people last night.  I understand that I shouldn't expect it due to the fact that I was hosting, but as I said it is quite expensive to host such a party, and all of you know that.  

Here are the numbers.  Total spent: $300.  My money I was willing to front as my own: $100.  I was expecting around 20 people at the party. 20 people, $200 = 10 Dollars a person.  Simple and cheap. We had more than 20 people making it even easier for people who might be in a situation.  (how much is cover at clubs, events, movies, or concerts nowadays?)

This is a party I like to do and have fun doing.  The clean up alone is a pain in the ass but the show was worth it.  And I hope people think of the Fourth as a tradition and understand that I want to keep it that way with a certain quality.

p.s. And thanks to the people who brought food and drink."

Gospel of Judas back in spotlight after 20 centuries
Swiss foundation seeks to shed light on controversial Christian text named after apostle said to have betrayed Jesus.
By Patrick Baert - GENEVA About 2,000 years after the Gospel according to Judas sowed discord among early Christians, a Swiss foundation says it is translating for the first time the controversial text named after the apostle said to have betrayed Jesus Christ.

The 62-page papyrus manuscript of the text was uncovered in Egypt during the 1950s or 1960s, but its owners did not fully comprehend its significance until recently, according to the Maecenas Foundation in Basel.

The manuscript written in the ancient dialect of Egypt's Coptic Christian community will be translated into English, French and German in about a year, the foundation specialising in antique culture said on Tuesday.

""We have just received the results of carbon dating: the text is older than we thought and dates back to a period between the beginning of the third and fourth centuries,"" foundation director Mario Jean Roberty said.

The existence of a Gospel of Judas, which was originally written in Greek, was outlined by a bishop, Saint Irenee, when he denounced the text as heretical during the second century.

""It's the only clear source that allows us to know that such a Gospel did exist,"" Roberty explained.

The foundation declined to say what account Judas is said to give in his alleged gospel.

According to Christian tradition, Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus Christ by helping the Romans to find him before he was crucified.

""We do not want to reveal the exceptional side of what we have,"" Roberty said.

The author of the text is unknown.

""No one can clearly state that Judas wrote it himself,"" Roberty said, while pointing out that the other gospels were probably not written by their supposed authors either.

The four recognised gospels of the New Testament describe the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and are said to record his teachings from the eyes of four of his disciples, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

The Roman Catholic Church limited the recognised gospels to the four in 325, under the guidance of the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine.

Thirty other texts - some of which have been uncovered - were sidelined because ""they were difficult to reconcile with what Constantine wanted as a political doctrine,"" according to Roberty.

The foundation's director said the Judas Iscariot text called into question some of the political principles of Christian doctrine.

It could also to some extent rehabilitate Judas, whose name has often come to symbolise the accusation of deicide - God-killing - levelled by some Christian teachings against the Jewish people, he added.

After the manuscript is restored, the text is due to be translated and analysed by a team of specialists in Coptic history led by a former professor at the University of Geneva, Rudolf Kasser.

Jean-Daniel Kaestli, an expert on gospels who has seen the manuscript, said the discovery was ""very interesting"", although the papyrus was in a bad state.

He added that it was not going to lead to a revolutionary change in the vision of the Bible, although it could shed some new light on parts of Christianity's holy text.

The Maecenas Foundation, which aims to protect archaeological relics found in poor countries, hopes to organise exhibitions around the manuscript and to produce a documentary on the process of unravelling the text.

The full launch is due in Easter 2006. </lj-cut>

Hmmm... Seems to be more than a coincidence that this amazing news about judas seems to just happen to come out just in time for easter.  Its just like when the main actor and actress get married just before the movie release. (Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt before ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and what is this with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn??!!??) Then break up.  It was to add on to the hype and excitement.  Gives them more money.  Huh?  Weird.. could the christians have decided to make the ""release date"" around Easter for such a reason?"

This movie is a tribute to when actors <i>really</i> get into their part.  Christian Bale weighed 120 pounds.  I didn't even recognize that he was the same actor that played Batman.  The movie is set in LA, but it took me the movie and a documentary to figure that out. The costuming was fit for the movie, still, the skinny suit was sooo unbelievable (I'm still going of on how skinny he was). The plot is rather thick because it has a style relative to Memento, Fight Club, and 12 Monkeys. The photography blended the special effects seamlessly.  I didn't know there was effects until I saw the documentary. The director has directed some TV episodes from 'The shield' and 'The Wire'. A great beginning to his career.

Grade B+


My Movie of the week: 'The Woodsman'."

"event","Bewitched:

It seems that Hollywood still winds the meat grinder and produces remakes and spin offs of 'popular' TV shows, books, and older movies. But I have to admit, sometimes, they are not all that bad.  Nicole Kidman did a smashing job. Will Ferrell did a decent job acting, but of course, there is always 'Will Ferell' in any character he plays. There wasn't much in the costuming. It seemed they wore the same thing throughout the entire movie, very 'hollywood' clothes. The plot was a normal romance with a secret.  The photography and special effects were amusing and well blended. Directing... well, look up Nora Ephron.  She has done: 'You've Got Mail', 'Sleepless in Seattle' and she wrote 'When Harry Met Sally'. If you enjoyed those movies you will see the same direction in this one. Love through all odds.

Grade: C+

The Woodsman:

Oh No!  Not another Kevin Bacon movie!  Quite the opposite. I was stunned where this movie went.  It tickles upon a taboo subject and takes you on a ride. Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, and Mos Def are the known. Bacon and Sedgwick's character fit well and Mos Def didn't rap. The Costumes were linked well with the area and characters. The plot is somewhat loose and keeps you trying to sort it out. There was not much on the side of special effects, but the photography was so good you might think twice on whether it was an effect or just really good camera angles. Nicole Kassell doesn't have much behind her in directing. For what there is, there is a lot to look forward to.

Grade A-"

It continued overheating alot; but after the 100th run trying to get back home (restarting and watching the heat bar and shutting it off when it reached ""h"" and starting over and over and over...) it started working normally. I was soooo happy to see it idleing at 800rpms (instead of going back and forth from 1500 to 2000 back to 1500 and then 2000...)and temp meter not rocketing to ""H"" every 30 seconds of driving.

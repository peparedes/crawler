"event","So, life has been same ole same ole for me in Pville.  Still subbing.  Still searching for a full time job.  Still not having much luck.  I am a bit tempted at times to apply for jobs out of this area and take them if I can...but I really don't want to leave my Eddie!  I also don't want to sub again next year. I just really really really hope something pops up in this area that I can at least have a chance at!  Along with job searching, I've been looking for a summer job as well.  Eddie is doing an internship in Madison again this summer at the same engineering company.  I would like to stay in Pville again, but wouldn't really like to babysit/nanny again - at least not for 1 certain pain in the neck kid!  Who knows what will turn up for me.

I've been having fun a few weekends a month and every Tuesday night with a new set of friends.  I met 6 new friends through Eddie since 5 of them are ee's whom he has classes with.  They are a very fun group, although a few enjoy alcohol a little too often if you ask me!  One of them grew up only 35 minutes from me in Viroqua!  He is a country boy too (although he has yet to experience milking a cow....so he's not a full blown country boy, but I'll change that!), so we have lots in common.  He is very fun to be with and can always make me laugh!  Although, he is one who likes to drink and randomly get high - which isn't too cool in my book.  I have to be honest, I have a little crush on him and am pretty sure he has one on me too.  So, we do our friendly flirting and all is well!  Eddie isn't concerned and has no reason to be, it's all harmless!

I suppose there isn't too much else that I can catch up on.  I'm certainly glad that spring has sprung and am ready for green grass and leaves on the trees and shorts and sandals!"

I have spent all of my weekends with Eddie keeping busy either visiting his parents or my parents or in Madison.  I miss him lots during the week, but thankfully we are only an hour apart and can visit on the weekends.  I will be so happy when school starts and we are together daily and will be even happier when we don't have to live apart in the summers!

As I type this I am wondering if anyone is even going to read it.  It seems those that are in livejournal whom I know kind of neglected it like I did.....but now I'm back for an update.

I am still searching for a teaching position for the fall near Pville.  When I search for jobs across the state there seems to be a large lack of openings in this part of the state!  If I were willing to move I could get a job, but I don't want to move.  I will probably end up subbing and will hopefully get into more schools since I will be able to get in at the beginning of the school year.  I don't mind subbing, but some schools don't pay very well...

Otherwise all is well in my world.  I have fun with Pville friends during the week and enjoy weekends with Eddie :)"

I will really miss the little ones and their hugs and smiles :)  I wish I could just stay with them instead of moving on to fourth grade, but I most go on!  The fourth grade teacher seems very nice and fun and I also think she will expect a lot of me.  I've heard that she's such an amazing teacher and it's almost intimidating to me!  But, I know I will learn a lot from her.  I am a little nervous about jumping from kindergarten to fourth grade because their developmental levels are so different and behavior management is my biggest worry.  Some of those kids are bigger than me!  
I wish I could post a picture of my kinderteners on here, but I don't think I should....if you know me you'll probably get to see the pictures or I'll email them to you :)
Well, I'd better get back to Eddie and get some supper ready:)  Here I come fourth grade!"

I began student teaching on September 1 at Iowa-Grant with kindergarteners.  There are 16 kids and they are a great group.  For the most part they listen well, except for a few who like to challenge me!  They like to be at school get along well with each other. My cooperating teacher is so great.  She is so helpful with everything in the classroom.  I'm glad that I have such a great role model to work with :)  I am excited to be planning more of the lessons and taking over more of the teaching time.  I need to be thinking about some fillers to do in case the children are done with projects early.  How can I manage the whole room if my teacher is gone?  It is very helpful for her to have someone else in the room watching kids at the other end of the room.  I think I need to be more aware of everything that is happening in the classroom and think of ways to keep them all under control at opposite ends of the room.
I do like working with kindergarten students and I enjoy what we teach, I enjoy it much more than I though I would.  It's not so bad having to tie kids' shoes every day and tell them everything they should be doing.  They are so young that they like coming to school, they love their teacher and are eager to learn -it's great!  I'm anxious for the step up to fourth grade in November - what a change that will be in subject matter!  
My life is goign very well right now and I'm happy:)  I stay pretty busy when I get home at 5 or so everyday, but it's nice.  Eddie is super busy studying and doing homework and making circuits and such on his circuit board - and then trying to explain to me what it all means.....smile and nod, smile and nod!  I hope that he does well in his classes this semester.  I try to do what I can around the apartment - washing dishes, picking up, doing things for him so he has more time to study.  Of course, I also try to pull him away at times to go for a walk in the evenings or for a picnic, like we did yesterday.
I suppose, I should head back to the apartment and cook up some supper.  I need to collect some leaves along the way for the kids!"

I do love this cooler weather we are having.  It is so comfortable to be outside.  I wish I had more things to do outside like I would at home so I could be outside for more than an hour playing frisbee golf.  

I am planning a visit to SPF Friday afternoon.  I hope that everyone is there and they aren't too busy for me ;)  It will be nice to see everyone again because I really miss working there.

I am at work right now.  We are having an extended break this morning.  A treat of rootbeer floats was brought in for a coworker's birthday.  He turns 21 on Saturday. 

I hope this weekend isn't too stressful.  My Grandma and Uncle are coming up for my Dad's birthday - on Saturday.  This is the Grandma that has a major problem with Eddie and I living together.  Hopefully she doesn't bring it up.....because she won't change my mind about anything.  Mom, as usual, will be crabby because the mother-in-law is up.

For the past 4 weeks I have been student teaching with two and three year olds and it has been an experience.  Tomorrow is my last day.  I am happy that it is over because I'm not much into teaching the little ones.  The material isn't very appealing to me I guess.  But, I will miss the little ones.  They are so cute and can always put a smile on your face :)  I'll have to stop in once and a while after work to say hi.  

I got an email from a friend that makes me want to give him a visit, but he's a ways away.  I'll have to send him a card or something.... I miss friends from work too.

Eddie and I are all moved in to our apartment.  There are still a few odds and ends we need to take care of and purchase, but it's really nice.  There is a lot of space and I like it!  Our parents met this weekend which was neat.  We all went to my home at the farm and took a tour and had lunch.  It was a fun time. I started my early childhood student teaching this morning.  There were 3 new girls and two of them cried almost all morning.  I felt so bad, but they will adjust.  It went well, the rest of the week I am in charge of story time and will have more and more responsibilities the longer I am there.  It will be ok...
Work is going well.  Like I said before the poeple I work with are fun and nice.  I am used to getting up at the crack of dawn now.  
I sure do miss working at SPF.  I miss my friends the most of all and miss being out in the sun....all I have right now is a slight farmers tan.  I will try my best to visit but it may be a while!

"event","Hi All,
I went home to the farm this weekend and brought Eddie with me.  I stopped at SPF to pick my orphans and hydrangeas Todd set out for me - thanks so much!

Saturday afternoon we went to a demolition derby in Gays Mills because my brother had a car in it.  I had my video camera ready this time and was sure to push the record button (had a slight brain lapse with that during the last derby!).  He got to make one hit and then couldn't get his car started again, so he was counted out.  He doesn't seem  to have much luck with that car...last time he did the same thing, only this time something was messed up with his fuel pump...

Sunday morning and afternoon was absolutely beautiful with not a cloud in the sky for quite a while.  Eddie and I were outside by 9 AM helping Mom plant her flowers.  She planted lots and lots of petunias in hanging baskets that are scattered about the yard. Eddie dug holes for the hydrangeas...Todd will have to tell me how to keep them trimmed down and all... Then Eddie and I weeded and planted all of the orphans and then watered them.  It took us quite a while!  I sure hope the little guys make it since they are so small.  I forgot what some of them were so I will be surprised when they bloom :)

Went to a graduation party for Amber on Sunday afternoon which was nice and then headed back to Platteville. 

Working on campus has been going well, it's very laid back - at least the crew I'm on is.  The people I work with are very fun and keep my entertained.  It's tough waking up at 5:40 AM though!!  Eddie and I will move into our apartment on June 4 and our parents will come and help us and will meet for the first time :)  Hopefully his parents can visit the farm on Sunday of that weekend.

I guess I will be going with Eddie to his house this weekend, it will be nice to see his parents again.  I will be helping his Mom plant some flowers and will bring some moon flower seeds for her to plant (Todd, how well will the seeds grow?  I planted a bunch a my house too) Eddie and his Dad will be doing some fishing.  It should be a nice weekend:)

Well, that's a quick recap, just keeping busy here in Platteville.  Buhbye!"

I have a ""final"" tonight that consists of handing in our take home final at a potluck picnic for our class :)  It should be enjoyable and will be one of the last times everyone in our classes will be together to hang out since almost all of us will be student teaching in the fall.  Tuesday from 3-5 I have a final, but am not worried because it will be pretty easy.  Then I have nothing to do the rest of the week but read a little and cook supper and lunch for Eddie!
I have to go shoe shopping this weekend because I have to have leather shoes for work, tennis shoes are not acceptable...I will miss wearing flip flops all day long!
I hope that Mother's Day went well for everyone.  I called home and talked to my mother for over an hour!  She was telling me about my Grandma being really upset that Eddie and I will be living together.  I am not very happy with the negative attitude she has when it comes to other people making different decisions than she would.  She is a lovely lady, but can try to be controlling and always frowns upon change.  I think she just needs a reality check, she's not quite ""in with the times.""  Oh well, she may be unhappy, but I am excited about it!
I am glad this semester is over!  It seemed like one big rut to me.  I didn't have much homework to do, I didn't get to be in classrooms and I just don't feel like I accomplished much!  I hope this summer will be a pleasant change of pace for me:)

He is working on yet ANOTHER derby car...he just got rid of one so I think he thought that meant it was ok to get another to replace it :)  I helped Dad milk cows that night and I fed the 12 baby calves and cleaned up calf pee and wet straw...worked out my muscles ;)  Matt and I talked from 10:30 to 1 AM that night!  I am so glad we get along so well - we never fight AT ALL!  Yay for maturity!!
Saturday I headed to the bank for some dinero - we all need more dinero!  Later that afternoon I made a visit to my friend's house.  She just had a baby a month ago and I wanted to see it.  She has a little girl and she is just the cutest thing!  I held her a lot and oohed and aaahed over her sweetness and tininess!  It was nice to talk to my friend as well.  I babysat that night at 8 for the little boy I've watched since he was 3 and now he is 10.  He is such a talker and he thinks he knows everything!  He confessed the name of his ""girlfriend""  It was so cute!!  Those fifth grade romances are adorable :)  We watched a movie, did dishes and then played Monopoly from 10:30 to 2 AM!  He just didn't want to stop playing!  He ended up ""whooping me"" as he calls it by about 5 thousand dollars!  I was impressed at his banker and money skills :) I went home after that and hit the hay at about quarter to 3!  I think he was sad for me to leave b/c I hadn't babysat him in months and months.  We do correspond by letter once in a while.  It's fun writing to a fifth grader:)  They are very interesting kids!  Of course, all kids are interesting ;)
Sunday was yard work day.  There was a boxelder tree that had falled down last year in our backyard and we finally got around to cutting it apart this spring!  Matt, Mom, and I got it all taken care of and I sprayed all of the thistles in our yard and pulled up tall stalks of dead weeds.  Mom and I have discussed planting shady plants under our trees and she is going to order some.  It should look nice. OUr yard  looks beautiful this spring.  There are only about 15 dandelions blooming in the whole thing!  Our grass is so thick and lush and looks so nice when it is freshly cut:)  I really enjoy just walking around our farm and marveling at it's valley beauty!  There is no place better than home and that valley:) I then made ""lunch"" consisting of hamburgers and mac n cheese.  Finally I left for Pville at 6.  It was a long eventful weekend and I loved every minute of it!  I love my family!"

We did lots of fun activities outdoors like simulating wolf/deer survival - some people were wolves and the rest deer and we had to run from one end of the area to the other collecting ""lives"" while trying to avoid the wolves by either stepping into safe zones or ""freezing""  I succeeded 8 years in a row!  It was really fun and I am excited to teach my students and eventual children about the wonders of nature and how to understand and care for it!  
I was disappointed by the attitudes of some of my classmates who thought the whole experience was ""pointless"";  I am afraid they are just not outdoor people (who could live that way?!) and will not make very exciting teachers!

On my drive to class this morning I saw nearly 20 school buses...then got stuck between two buses that were unloading!  UWP is hosting an FFA thingy where high schools send some of their FFA members here to participate in judging contests of crops, seeds, plants, cheese, milk, animals, etc.  So, yea, there are like 500 or so high school students on campus today!  It's funny how they are so easy to pick out of a crowd, not only b/c they are sporting their school apparel and not carrying bookbags, but just b/c of how naive and young they look!  Plus, all of the high school boys are throwing snowballs at their friends.  How amusing!  I can't believe it was only four years ago that I was in their shoes, yet it seems like much longer than that and I feel I have matured unbelievably.  Crazy what graduating from high school and going to college will do to a young person like myself!
Yay for Spring Break beginning tomorrow!  Although I am not heading to Florida like some of my friends, I am still happy for it to be here.

"event","Hi to anyone from SPF who reads this.  I miss you all very much and would like to hear from you ;) ;)
I keep worrying about finding a job in Platteville this summer....I know nothing will be as fun as SPF, but I hope I can find something I enjoy and that involves being outdoors.  Maybe I should just mow lawns all summer or garden for people or something.....hehe, I don't think I'd make as much money as I need doing that though.  Anyway, if you haven't checked out my livejournal yet, the username is 'karibeaner'

Take care!  Write soon!  Love ya!"

"event","Just finished lunch with my Eddie.  Ate an overpriced plate of tortellini with alfredo sauce, breadsticks, and yogurt.  Right now I'm feeling pretty good, but was better this morning when the sun was shining.  
My younger brother is coming to visit me tonight.  I usually call him my little brother, but the difference of about 7 inches doesn't qualify him as little :)  I hope I can keep him entertained!  I'm sure he will enjoy hanging out with Eddie and his roommates while having a little to drink.
Oh, Eddie helped me make scotcharoos last night, I haven't had any yet, but I hope they are good!  This morning in made something called ""Heavenly Fruit Salad.""  It calls for a large box of instant vanilla pudding, 1 1/2 cups milk and a small container of cool whip.  First mix the milk and pudding mix, cool 10 mins, fold in cool whip.  Next, add a large, drained, can of fruit cocktail, but up 2 bananas and add a cup or so of marshmallows. Fold everything together and viola!  I really do enjoy cooking and baking, mostly baking because I like the sweet stuff.  Since I bought myself some cookbooks, I've been experimenting more often and finding recipes I like, so far so good!
This afternoon I planned on working some more on my ""School as Community"" paper, but do not have the ambition right now.  We'll see what I feel like after playing some Internet games ;)
Tata for now, I hope someone is reading this stuff, if not, I guess I am improving my typing skills, eh?!"

"event","I am in a very good mood today, although it is pretty chilly outside, the sun is still shining!
I actually woke up at a decently early time of 7:45.  Then I went to the middle school and observed two fifth grade classes and had lunch with friends and Eddie.  
Now I am in the library procrastinating....should be writing a lesson plan that is due on Thursday and need to begin a five page paper.
I do admit that I am a bit tired right now though, a nap would be nice, but the night time is for sleeping, so I'll have to wait!"

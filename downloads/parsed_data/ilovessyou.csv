"event","<p>Ah, it's been a long time since my last ramble. so yeah I'm here again. I'm gonna tell you about the things that happened to me for the past few days. Bear with it. It's my journal, after all XDDDD <br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""woohoo""><br /><strong><u>SUNDAY STORIES</u></strong> <br /><br />Anyway when I went to mass last Sunday (Sundays are so -_- so many things happening in just one day) I wore normal clothes (means they look boy-ish again) and yeah we went go greenhills because my daddy wants to eat there. We ate in Little Asia again, so delicious! It's the best Asian restaurant I had known. I ate so many my belt can burst anytime. haha so yeah my brother went inside Promenade because I guess his girlfriend was there T_T so poor me left all alone again. But I shall not worry because my Susu babe is with me :D Duhh XD ipod is my savior! Most especially it carries videos! Omg i so love it, i named it Xiah &lt;333 haha yeah weird me ipod has a name! So anyway I was watching Love in the ice when suddenly this cute omfg Chinese boy was right infront of me. oh yes, i got distracted (I'm sorry Susu babe DD: ) because he was CUTE. yeah he smiled at the person on his left and waved his hand and then walked and i realized...HE'S GAY. DDDD: <br />so SAD. cute chinese boy, but he's gay D: he's...a waste XD so yeah I went back to dongbang. ^_^ <br /><br /><strong><u>GRADUATION GIFT</u></strong> <br /><br />Yesterday, my tita called my mom if she wants to go out and mommy said yes. Was about to go with her cause my bestfriend asked me if we could go out. Oh how I miss her T_T we were loud always..always laughing until we cry haha and she wanted to have a joyride with me, yeahhh with her NEW WHEELS omg that's so fine her own car its SO BIGTIME. I wish I have mine too D: but she cancelled it because her brother is such a party pooper T_T so yeah i stayed home again, waiting for mom's gifts 8DDD <br /><br />And then mom came... <br /><br />She brought out the ""gifts"". It was all food! I was like ""Mom do you really want me to be fat?"" And she's like ""It's okay, you'll get stressed when you enter college"" T________T I still don't want to go to college because it means less time for dongbang! DDDD: So yeah after that she took out an angpao (chinese envelope, its red and used to put money for gifts) and then she said it was from my tita its my grad gift! I grabbed it and immediately opened it. <br /><br /><br />drumroll...... <br /><br /><br />DANG IT'S 6000 PESOS. HOMG HOMG. I MEAN THAT'S A LOT. ONE THING WAS CLEAR IN MY MIND...THIS CALLS FOR DONG BANG MERCHANDISE!!!!!! MUAHAHAHA I HAVE MONEY FOR T CONCERT DVD!!!!!

I can't watch dongbang in our school tv! Dang i remember our lunch fangirling moments. It is..ILLEGAL. we just plug in our laptops, we have our own jack for tv and voila!

"event","<p>Title: LOST<br />Length: Oneshot<br />Rating: PG<br />Genre: Romance/ fluff<br />Pairings: Yoosu/Jaeho<br />Summary: Sometimes, lost things are replaced by way better ones.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Yoochun creeped his way to their bedroom when he saw Junsu crying at the corner. Tears fell from the beautiful eyes of the tenor. He embraced his legs and rested his chin on his knees. Junsu wasn't making too much noise while crying, but you will realize that he's crying because he shrugged his beautiful shoulders. Unfortunately, Yoochun didn't succeed in his creeping.&nbsp;<br /><br />""Ow."" Yoochun bumped to one of the tables right after entering the room. Well, the creaking of the door didn't help him too. </p><p>Junsu saw Yoochun coming and he didn't want to let Yoochun see him like that, wasted and all. The tenor wiped his tears with the back of his palms, and plastered a fake smile in less than a second. Yoochun always thought his lover was really beautiful when smiling, gorgeous when giving a cold killer pose, and sexy when dancing. But at that time when he saw Junsu crying, it broke his heart but at the same time he seized the moment--Junsu was really beautiful even when crying. How the tears ran down the tenor's flawless cheeks, how his eyes close when a trickle of tear manages to get out, how his nose turns red, how he breathes through his mouth. </p><p>""Junsu ah.."" Yoochun crawled his way to Junsu and settled beside him at the corner. </p><p>""Hi."" With his fake smile, Yoochun frowned and held his lover's hand.</p><p>""Why are you crying? I hate to see you that way.."" Yoochun cupped the tenor's cheeks and pressed a soft kiss.</p><p>""Chunnie..I hate to say it but i have to..."" </p><p>""Tell me, or else i'll cry too.."" tears began to form in Yoochun's eyes. </p><p>""You know that earrings you gave me in our 12th monthsary? I.....it's lost.."" And in less than a second that Junsu plastered a fake smile, in less than a second that tears bursted from his eyes once again. </p><p>""Su ah..."" Yoochun closed eyes, opened them and looked straight at Junsu's eyes.</p><p>""I know you're hurt because you lost it, but i just want you to know that it hurts me more to see you cry."" Yoochun kissed the back of Junsu's hand and hugged him tight.</p><p>""Chunnie..I'm sorry."" Sobs were heard all over the room. </p><p>""Don't say sorry Susu ah."" And Yoochun caressed the back of his lover. His chin rested at the other's nape, and he nuzzled his nose and he can smell a sweet scent. </p><p>""Su ah..What shampoo did you use? I like this smell."" Yoochun grinned and continued nuzzling his nose into his lover's nape. </p><p>Junsu giggled and pushed Yoochun, breaking the hug. </p><p>""You're so dorky."" And he laughed, covered his mouth with his petite hands.</p><p>""Let's go to bed, we have an early schedule tomorrow."" Junsu stood from his place and began to undress, removing his shirt first.</p><p>""Can't we go to bed later? Can we just....15 minutes Su?..Please.."" Yoochun immediately stood up and ran to his lover, hugging him from the back and kissing Junsu's nape, down to his smooth shoulders.</p><p>""No Chunnie. It's late."" Junsu removed Yoochun's arms in his waist.</p><p>""Please...just 15 minutes.."" Yoochun pleaded and continued on seducing his lover, grinding his body and kissing him passionately. It sent shivers down Junsu's spine. He could say yes, he wanted to feel Yoochun, wanted him to make love, wanted Yoochun to fill him. But it wasn't just the right time, he just cried for dear life. He didn't want to have a hazy sex after crying. It ruins the mood. </p><p>""No Park Yoochun."" Yoochun pouted, those red lips that Junsu cannot resist. But Junsu did resist, besides it's 3 in the morning. Yoochun accepted his defeat and slipped in his blue pyjamas.</p><p>""Sleep tight Chunnie."" Junsu whispered to his lover, and closed his eyes.</p><p>Yoochun faced the opposite, looking at their desk lamp, rolled his eyes and sighed. </p><p>~o~</p><p>Junsu woke up disoriented. The sun was blinding him, and the sheets were tangled in his legs making it hard for him to move. He faced the other side, and was about to say ""Goodmorning Chunnie"" but he frowned, finding a pillow next to him.He scratched his head, and slowly slipped out of his sheets. He found a note in his mirror, a neon post-it carrying the words: Breakfast is ready. Went to the gym.</p><p>Is Yoochun really mad? Why'd he leave him all alone? He never do that, he would always make sure to be the one to greet Junsu first. Even if a headache is bugging him, he'll make sure he'll be there for Junsu. Yoochun had promise to give him morning kisses and lovely hugs. But today is the day that he failed.</p><p>Junsu walked to his bathroom to take a hot shower, to relax his aching muscles from their dance rehearsals, to relax his mind from thinking thoughts..that Yoochun would leave him someday after their days of glory. He shook his head and tried to erase those thoughts, and thought maybe he was just going too far. </p><p>He dressed up in one of his favorite clothes, and made his way to the dining hall expecting a nice breakfast. There he saw his hyungs and Changmin feasting over the supposedly nice breakfast for him. </p><p>""Hyung!!!"" he shouted at the top of his lungs and ran to save his bread hanging from Changmin's mouth. He swatted Yunho's hand reaching for the perfectly sliced ham. Jaejoong wiped his mouth, leaving no marks of the food. </p><p>""How can you eat this?! It's for me! Yoochun made it for me!"" </p><p>Jaejoong covered his mouth with his one hand and pointed the other at Changmin.</p><p>""It's his fault Junsu. He said we should eat it."" And Changmin's eyes popped like a popcorn would when heated.</p><p>""Me?! I just suggested it! But you followed me! I didn't force you!"" Changmin raised his voice.</p><p>""Ya!"" And Yunho hit Changmin's head, real hard.</p><p>""Why are you raising your voice?! That's Jaejoong you're talking to! Where is the thing respect I taught you?"" Yunho's eyebrows twitched.</p><p>Changmin stared at his foot, scratched his head and whispered a cuss. Lucky Yunho didn't hear it, or else he would've been reprimanded twice.</p><p>""I--I'm sorry Junsu..It's also my fault, I didn't stop them instead I joined. I'm sorry."" </p><p>Junsu frowned, but he couldn't take it when all of them looked like they lost 20 million, it's gonna be New Year in a few hours anyway. So he forgave them, had a group hug and all that. Jaejoong said sorry again and made a new breakfast in order to make up for the one they ate. </p><p>After a few minutes, their manager called informing them that they wouldn't do anything today but rest since it's holidays and SM had given them their time for new year. The four of them jumped for joy. Junsu shouted for a movie but in a second, he lost his cheerfulness cause he remembered about the earrings that Yoochun had given him, and that it's gonna be new year in a few hours; and also their Anniversary. </p><p>Junsu was having a bad day. Yoochun wasn't beside him when he woke up, and he haven't called since morning. He couldn't bare it any longer, his lover is missing. If anything bad happens to Yoochun, he would blame himself for not doing anything. </p><p>""For goodness sake, where is Yoochun?"" The three were startled when Junsu shouted his question. They guesed it was serious since Junsu called Yoochun his first name and not their pet name. Changmin for some reason, didn't hear his hyung asking a damn question. </p><p>""I don't know. He told me he was going to run an errand for manager hyung--Junsu is your hand shaking?"" Junsu was shaking. His hands moved as if they have a life not controlled by the mind, and body but moves for itself. </p><p>""Yunho--I think you need to calm him down."" Jaejoong's eyes full of concern for the person who makes their group cheerful. </p><p>Junsu was 12 years old then when he came to SM, to debut and become a great singer. But he was also 12 when he saw Yoochun who was now his bandmate and boyfriend; he was 12 when he first peed on his pants and had a slight nervous breakdown after seeing Yoochun. Junsu doesn't know how to stop it, it just happens. It happens when he's getting worked up, pissed or nervous. He'd always shake and utter a few words. </p><p>""Whe--re is Yoochun?"" He continued to shake, worst than a few seconds before.</p><p>""Junsu calm down.."" Yunho patted his back, and whispered some comforting words.<br />Being the leader, Yunho had mastered how to calm Junsu down and to get him back to his cheerful mode. Yunho got Junsu to sleep even though the night was young. Junsu fell asleep, when finally his lover arrived home safe.</p><p>""Yoochun where the hell have you been? Junsu's been--"" And Yunho was cut. He hates it when he's cut, but Yoochun never remembers.</p><p>""What happened? Where's Junsu?!"" And Yoochun grabbed Yunho's shoulders, shaking them mercilessly. </p><p>""You know, I'm not a parent. But kids, please do behave and learn to calm down. And Changminnie, stop eating that. That's Jaejoong's."" Yunho shrugged Yoochun off and swatted Changmin's hand to prevent the cake from being molested by Changmin's tongue. Yunho pointed to the couple's room and shook his head. ""I don't know if he's still sleeping. But you can--"" Yoochun dashed his way to their room, Yunho frowned as he murmured about respect.</p><p>The door swung open, and there Junsu was, lying in their bed sleeping like an angel. Yoochun didn't want to wake him, but he's so careless that Junsu started opening his beautiful eyes. </p><p>""Chunnie!"" and Junsu jumped and gave his lover a tight embrace. It seemed like they didn't see each other for several years. </p><p>""Where have you been...I was so worried.."" He kept on hugging Yoochun so much that Yoochun could've choked. </p><p>""Junsu ah.. I'm sorry."" </p><p>"".....""</p><p>""Happy new year!!!"" Yunho, Jaejoong and Changmin dashed to their room to greet them. It was new year, and Yoochun made it. </p><p>Junsu let go of Yoochun and frowned. ""H--happy new year Chunnie."" </p><p>""Why so cold? I'm back right?.."" And Yoochun leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on his lover's lustlful lips.</p><p>Yoochun slowly smiled and took out a box in his pocket, and opened it. A diamond filled cross earrings hung at his finger. </p><p>""Su...I know you loved that earrings as much as you love me, but it's lost...you can't get it back.

The time is passing so slowly right now, guess that's my life without you. I can't quite walk straight, and I'm thankful I reached home. I lie down, to rest my weak body. I've been lying here for hours, can't get you off my mind. I want to sleep, want to rest my eyes from crying. But every time i close my eyes, i only see you. Your image grows bigger, making me burst in tears again. I just wish that this dream ends. But the truth remains, you're gone. I try to erase the things that happened, but it just keeps coming back. The more i drive the thoughts away, the more it haunts me. Am i still in your heart? There's a thousand words that i can say just to make you come back, come back to my arms. You told me you didn't love me. You never loved me. I don't understand. I don't want to believe. It's been days since i last saw you, since i heard your voice pushing me away. I know you love me. You're lying, i can see it in your eyes. Was there something that I did that you didn't like? Was there something that i didn't do for you? Was there words that i should utter? Am i not complete enough? If there is just a way to get you back.. I will submit to your demands, I will do anything for you.. There's a lot of things that i don't understand..That I don't want to know. You have been the one for me, i want to keep it that way. My heart aches so much, I can't breathe. Life for me is not the same without you. I just want you back, please come back to me. <br /></p><p><br />I see you with girls, flirting and touching. It breaks my heart, and I'm losing my mind. I thought you were forever mine, but i guess it was just my dream. Not yours. I'm so scared. So scared that I won't see you beside me when I wake up. I just want to perish with those good memories that you brought into my life, thank you for those. I want to hold you, I want it to go away..&nbsp;<br /><br />Even though my heart stops beating, just say you love me again and it will beat for you. Only for you..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[Junsu's point of view]</p><p>I lost a friend, a lover. I lost the other half of my heart. I was so used to be with you, and i want to be honest - I lied. Your face is covered with tears that i never wanted to see. Your heart that beats for me is what i long to hear. I never wanted to hurt you this way, I just want you to deserve someone better than me. The hardest thing that i ever did in my whole life was to drive away the only one that i cherished the most. The only one I truly love. It was just two days that I lied to you and my heart wanted to burst the moment i saw you cry. I just wanted to die that day that i lied to you. I loved you more than anything, more than my life. I want to tell you that you always give me a reason to live, and to spend the rest of my life with you. If i only have the chance to bring back the time, I'll hold you tight and tell you how much I love you. In this world, you're the only one i ever need. When your hand brushes mine, when you smile and say that you love me, I just want to scream to the world how much alive I am. </p><p>I just want to bring back that day..You don't know how much i shed tears for that mistake. Sometimes I see you smiling, and you turn to look at my way- I just pretend that I'm happy too. That I never thought of you after that day. But after all the pretending, I would go to a place where no one can find and cry. My heart is breaking every time i see you, that I can never hold you again. That it was goodbye.I would date a girl or two just to ease the pain and try to forget about you. Their kisses meant nothing, their hugs are empty. I do not find love in them, but in you. It's your warmth that I long, your kisses that makes my world spin, your hugs that make me feel warm. Every time i try to make love with them, I just think about you. I suddenly stop, and recall the days when we think of our plans for the future as we made love. You told me that you will not let go, but I did. You're my once in a lifetime, you're the one I love. And even though you won't look at me anymore, I will still love you. </p><p>I want to love you. I want to be loved, just by you.<br /><br />~o~<br /><br />Another day comes, and all you can do is look at him. You just can't forget about him, but he seems that he has forgotten you completely. You try, but you just end up crying. Guess he wasn't for you, that he&nbsp;didn't love you at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />~o~<br /><br />You try to go on with your life, even though it hurts. A friend approached you one day, and said those words that make you weak and fall down on your knees. ""Yoochun ah!! Did you know?....Ju..Junsu ah! He's gone!"" Yes, he's really gone. You breakdown and cry. You will never see him again. He left you with a broken heart, and now he's leaving the real world. You run to his house, and you knock at their door as you call his name. ""Junsu ah! Junsu ah!! Open up! Let's talk!"" There was no one answering your call but the wind blowing. ""Junsu ah!!!"" You knock harder. Tears are flooding your eyes, but you don't seem to bother. Finally someone opens the door. But it wasn't him. It's his mother, who opposed to your relationship a long time ago. ""Yoochun..."" His mother didn't push you away. But instead she hugged you tight. You look at her face, those eyes, lips, curves...similar to his. Her hug, so warm that you felt he was in your arms again.&nbsp;<br /><br />""Yoochun...Junsu...he left us."" His mother was crying in front of you. ""Why? How?..."" You question her and held her hands. ""The reason why i opposed your relationship was because Junsu..He's really sick. I know I was really harsh on you Yoochun and you didn't even know why. I just wanted to protect my son, and your life as well. I don't want him to fall in love with you because I know he will leave someday and I was afraid that you will give him more burden and agony when time comes. I also pity you because I know that you love Junsu and you will cry for him everynight."" Your eyes linger and you don't know what to say.&nbsp; Your love was sick all along and he didn't tell you because he didn't want to see you sad knowing that he will leave someday. ""Yoochun ah..Junsu, my son..He loved you very much. More than his own life that I told him not to leave the house because he's sick but he insisted on seeing you. He didn't care if he would get sick at night just to make sure that you're home safe. He told me to give you this letter, and he said that you should be happy now because he's always with you."" His mother extended her hand giving you the letter that he wrote. You open the letter, and read it with your eyes.<br /><br /><i>Yoochun ah,&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm sorry if i didn't tell you about my condition. I don't want to see you cry, I just want to leave you with good memories. I'm sorry for turning my back on you that day. I really regret that, because everything that I said that day was a lie. You made my life happier than ever, I truly loved you, I loved you since the day you first said my name. I never denied you in front of my friends, I told them everyday how I love you very much. Every time, every second i'm with you gives me a reason to live. I want you to be happy. Wherever I am right now, I am happy too. Because I know for once, you loved me when I was alive. Stop crying, if you will cry i will cry too. Don't&nbsp;be sad, I won't leave you I will always be with you.&nbsp;I love you, and will love you until the next life. Forever. <br /><br />Junsu</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Your tears won't stop falling. But you cry because you know he loves you and that he will still be with you, until the next life. </p>"

Bitch!"" Yoochun screamed as he saw Junsu hugged Jin Bora, manly and intensely. <br />""Hyung, calm down. It's just a cf, that's all. And besides look at his smile it's so fake. Haha"" Changmin pretended as if Junsu did not look like he was serious hugging Jin Bora, his male hormones kicking in. Yoochun was jealous, and everyone knows that you cannot mess with Yoochun. ""Shut up. You're the one who's fake. You know you can never lie in front of me Changmin."" Yoochun's eyes were like daggers in multiple ready to strike Jin Bora anytime. The Anyband Cf was airing for the first time. And instead of greeting Junsu with good reviews, Yoochun's carrying jealousy with him. ""Bitch bitch! Damn bitch i am going to shove your face on the ground!"" Yoochun threw a pillow at the plasma tv. ""Seriously Chunnie, I think you're the bitch right now. Look at your behaviour. Junsu won't like that."" Jaejoong said while stroking Yunho's black hair who's lying in his lap at the moment. ""Ughhh."" Yoochun was too irritated he went to the kitchen to get a glass of cold, heart-calming water. It did help him, but not as much as Junsu could if he just didn't hug her. But what can Junsu do? It's in the script. It's his job. He can't possibly complain, Anyband was just woah for him he couldn't let it pass for just a stupid hug. <em>""Stupid hug? I don't think so! Look at his expression! Uggghhhh!""</em> Yoochun couldn't get his mind off that scene.</p><p>-o-</p><p>""Chunnie where ya going?"" its good that Jaejoong noticed Yoochun who picked up his jacket and keys. Jaejoong was too busy flirting with Yunho to notice him. ""To get what's mine."" Yoochun stormed out of the room. Jaejoong and Yunho sensed that something was definitely wrong . They both get on their feet and grabbed their own jackets and followed Yoochun. Changmin remained in his seat. He never liked to meddle into Yoochun's jealousy issues considering that Yoochun slapped him at the face once for joking that Junsu was cheating on him. Yoochun drove too fast that Jaejoong and Yunho barely saw his rear. <em>""When I'm stressed or Angry I drive really fast""</em> Yoochun once said in an interview.<br />""Yunnie faster!"" Jaejoong buckled up in his seat. ""Joongie, stop shouting. We'll get into an accident if i drive too fast."" Yunnie had his hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. ""Oh my god. We don't want to know what Chunnie will do when he sees Jin Bora."" Jaejoong held his fone trying to call Junsu, but Junsu didn't pick up.</p><p>-o-</p><p>""Hey Chunnie!"" Junsu was extremely happy to see Yoochun storming in his way. ""I'm glad you're here to congra-"" Junsu was cut. Yoochun ignored him and was walking straight to Jin Bora. Junsu managed to pull Yoochun's arm. ""Chunnie what's up? Why are you ignoring me? Are you mad?"" Junsu was clueless. ""Oh Su,congratulations on your new cf! You look intimate with Jin Bora in that hug! It's so cute!"" Yoochun was faking a smile. Junsu knew he was being sarcastic. Worst comes. ""Hi Yoochun! I've been waiting to meet you. I'm Jin Bora."" She was extending her hands for a lovely handshake. Yoochun grabbed her hand,shaked it and threw it. ""Nice to meet you. And just incase you didn't know, I'm Junsu's boyfriend so fuck off. Oh yea one more thing, congratulations on hugging my boyfriend. I know you liked that. Bitch."" WHAPAK. Yoochun slapped Jin Bora's face. And Junsu was just there, his eyes cannot imagine what just happened. Jaejoong and Yunho just arrived in time to see the event. Their mouths forming an ""O"", their feet glued in the ground. Yoochun pulled Junsu's arm and dragged him to the car. ""Jin Bora i'm sorry for what happened. Yoochun's jealousy issues are the worst. We can't control him. Please forgive him."" Yunho stepped up to clean Yoochun's mess. ""Nah, it's okay. Junsu told me that earlier.I was expecting this to happen. I guessed right! Haha. Just go tell Yoochun for all I know, Junsu loves him very much. I envy Junsu. He didn't want to do the scene but the director insisted. It was just an act. Nothing else. Goodluck on the jealousy issues."" she patted Jaejoong and Yunho's shoulders and quickly walked out shouting ""Omg! Park Yoochun just slapped me!""</p><p>Yes, she was a Dong Bang Shin Gi fan. And a Micky Yoochun lover.<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Title:&nbsp;SAME STAR<br />&nbsp;Length: One-shot<br />&nbsp;Author: ilovessyou<br />&nbsp;Rating: PG<br />&nbsp;Genre:&nbsp;Smut/Porn<br />&nbsp;Pairings: Jaeho<br />&nbsp;Summary: Reality is now better than his dreams.<br /><br />Jaejoong was everything Yunho wanted. Yunho would always smile at Jaejoong and Jaejoong would always return the smile. They loved each other, always ready to face everything for love. Joongie?"" Yunho said Jaejoong's lovely name. ""Yes Yunnie?"" Jaejoong looked at Yunho. His dark beautiful eyes. His black raven hair, his bangs falling in his eyes. Those red lips forming to say Yunho's name. Oh God, he loved them. He loved everything about Jaejoong. He even loved Jaejoong's virus, when he catches a cold. ""Joongie, i love you."" Yunho smiled at his boyfriend. ""Yunnie, i love you too. Forever."" Jaejoong smiled back and pulled Yunho into a passionate kiss. Yunho parted with Jaejoong's lips and started trailing kisses down Jaejoongs smooth neck. Jaejoong lifted Yunho's shirt and managed to removed all of it. Jaejoong moaned when he realized Yunho was playing with his nipple ring. ""Aahh Yunho.."" Yunho went back to Jaejoong's lips. Their tongues dancing together, their bodies close. Yunho took Jaejoong's top off and touched his lean muscles. Jaejoong unbuckled his belt and Yunho did too. They weren't wearing any boxers, it was just after their dance performance and they felt akward dancing with boxers on. ""Come a litle closer?"" Jaejoong said in his sweetest voice. They have about an inch space, Yunho can almost breathe in what Jaejoong breathe out. ""Let me know if i'm doing this right."" Yunho's hand found its way to Jaejoong's length stroking it smoothly. ""Let me know if my grip's too tight."" Yunho continued to stroke it. ""Yunho---I want all of you."" Jaejoong's hand held Yunho's neck and pulled Yunho closer. Yunho took all of Jaejoong. Those thrusts were God's gift to Jaejoong, and he treasured every each one of it. The vacuous night steps aside as the two of them make their dreams come true. ""Let me now if this dream's yours too."" Yunho touched Jaejoong's face and kissed his cheek. ""Yunnie, i think we wished on the same star."" Jaejoong looked outside the window and pointed on the brightest star shining. ""It's looking after us."" Jaejoong just wished that what they were is just right, but its normally wrong. Jaejoong hugged Yunho tight and they both slipped under the covers. Jaejoong didn't want to sleep. He just wanted to hold Yunho. </p><p>Jaejoong didn't want to sleep, cause reality is now better than his dreams. </p>"

Yoochun truly loves Junsu, but Junsu never realizes it until one day.<br /><br /><br />""shut up."" Junsu said as he pushes Yoochun away. Junsu was clearly pissed, and he didn't want what's happening.<br />""I'm sorry Su, it's just that she called me and i don't wanna be rude that's why we met."" Yoochun cleared his throat after his explanation. ""Why didn't you tell me? I mean, we're together. You didn't even think of my feelings."" Junsu was fixing his clothes and organizing them to a luggage, signaling that he was leaving the apartment. Yes, he was leaving THEIR apartment. ""But Su, i thought we talked about trust already?"" Yoochun was staring at Junsu almost wanting to take off the clothes that he is packing. ""Don't push it Chunnie.This is different."" Junsu glared at Yoochun and started to pick up his luggages. ""Su, don't walk away."" Yoochun grabbed Junsu's arm and looked into his eyes. Yoochun's eyes were speaking. ""Don't leave me Su, please. I love you, you're the only one for me."" Junsu grabbed Yoochun's hand and threw it. ""I need space."" Junsu picked up his jacket and his keys and hurriedly went out the apartment. He was already in the elevator and Yoochun was just there staring blank where Junsu left him. The elevator doors were nearly closing but Yoochun managed to put his hand inside the small space in between. Yoochun felt that his eyes were watery, but he didn't mind. He started crying. Tears were falling from his eyes. Junsu was shocked when he saw Yoochun crying. He hated it when Yoochun was crying. He just wanted to hug him badly. But he chose not to. ""Su pp-please, let's talk."" he was still crying. ""Chunnie,i said i need space. Now can you please? I'm in a hurry.If you want to talk about our flaws i'm up for that.But for now, leave me alone."" Yoochun didn't know what to do but he let go, the doors closed. No Junsu in sight. He was still crying, but not the usual cry that he has but a cry that sounded dangerous. If nervous breakdown is in your mind, that can be. Yoochun couldn't feel his legs, he couldn't move. it was as if he was apollo, carrying the world that just crashed on him. </p><p>-o-</p><p>Junsu can feel his heart aching, he never wanted to cry. But for some reason, when Yoochun starts to cry he will surely follow. A tear fell from Junsu's eyes and he wiped it immediately. His heart broke. But he has to do this, he has to. He walked out of the elevator, out of the apartment lobby and searched for his car. Junsu had put in his luggages in his car and before driving he thought, let me pull myself together first. He breathed heavily and started his engine. ""Calm down Junsu, calm down."" he said to himself. </p><p>-o-</p><p>Lucky Yoochun didn't have a nervous breakdown. He was sitting on their favorite couch, LA-Z boy. He stared at the other side of the couch and a memory just hit him. He could see Junsu laughing and tickling him like hell. Yoochun never liked being tickled and that's why Junsu would always do it. But instead of getting irritated, he would end up kissing Junsu and smiling. then they would exchange ""I love you's"" kiss passionately. The picture faded and all Yoochun can see was an empty couch, no one to fill the space. A tear fell from Yoochun's eye. ""Su, please come back."" But there was no one inside the room but only him. </p><p>-o-</p><p>""What?!"" Jaejoong shouted at the phone. <br />""Joongie,stop shouting. My ears hurt now."" Yunho said the not-so-sweet way.<br />""I'm sorry Yunnie, are you still okay? I'll be there in 15 minutes. Yunnie what are we going to do?! This is different. I think this fight is the worst."" Jaejoong looked as his watch. It was almost 12 and he needs to go home so that he can cook food for Yunho who's sick at the moment.<br />""I don't know Joongie, maybe we should talk to Junsu later."" Yunho coughed.<br />""No, you're sick. I'll talk to Changmin. He's the best one to turn to. He can handle this. You go rest okay? Bye Yunnie take care."" Joongie signaled to his body guard to get the bags filled with food for Yunho. <br />""Okay, Bye."" Yunho ended the call and tucked himself to bed.</p><p>-o-</p><p>Jaejoong decided to go to Changmin's apartment rather than call him because this was something important. He couldn't possibly let this pass, this is about his bestfriends. He rang the doorbell and Changmin opened the door. ""Hey hyung, i've been expecting you."" Changmin said in a low voice. He's been maturing lately, and yes his cute image disappeared. ""Changmin, Junsu and-"" Jaejoong was cut. ""I know hyung, I'll take care of it. No worries."" Changmin smiled. Jaejoong glared at him. ""Why are you smiling Changmin-ah? This isn't just something to smile about."" Jaejoong folded his arms in his chest. ""Hyung, always remember to think positive. Think of what's going to happen after they kiss and make up."" Changmin smiled again. Jaejoong admired Changmin for his maturity. ""Okay then. Update me alright? I'm going home now, Yunho's still sick."" He patted Changmin's back. ""Sure hyung, tell Yunho hyung to get well soon."" And he lead Jaejoong to the door. ""Sure."" And Jaejoong headed to his car.</p><p>-o-</p><p>Changmin did all his advising. And Junsu was enlightened. ""Thank you for the advice Changmin, this is one of the reasons why I love you."" Junsu managed to smile. ""No worries hyung, just remember that he loves you dearly."" Changmin walked out of the door. After a few minutes, Junsu took his phone out. Inhale, exhale. ""Let's fix this."" Junsu said to himself. He called Yoochun. ""Hello?"" Junsu said.<br />""Su...please come back."" That was all Junsu heard and he felt his heart broke again. 2 days just passed without Yoochun in his arms. And yet he felt that he was dying. ""Chunnie, we need to talk. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Let's get this over with."" Junsu said in a strong voice which is contradicting to what he is feeling. He feels weak and empty. Yoochun was his world, the only reason why he's so successful for the past few years besides his family.</p><p>-o-</p><p>""Chunnie-"" Junsu was just beginning his statement when he found himself in his lover's arms. Junsu was angry, but all these rage were erased from his heart. He just wanted to stay there, in his lover's arms. He wanted to push Yoochun away, but no-Yoochun is his world. How can he do that? ""Chunnie please let go first."" Stop yourself from falling Junsu. That was what he was thinking. Yoochun let go of Junsu and cried. ""Chunnie,i'm really disappointed. How can you not tell me you met her? It breaks my heart everytime I see you with her."" Yoochun was still crying. ""Su, i met her because of business."" ""What business?"" Junsu raised his eyebrow. ""Su you know that you're the only one for me right? You're my world."" Yoochun took out a small box inside his pocket and opened it. ""I met her because I told her not to meet me anymore. I told her that you're the one I love and my future. You're the only one I see. So much that the universe explodes or the oceans dry..I love you. Forever and ever."" Junsu's eyes were about to pop out when he heard Yoochun's explanations. He wanted to spank himself because he never gave a moment for Yoochun who was elucidating 2 days ago. Inside the box were couple rings with their names engraved. YOOCHUN AND JUNSU FOREVER. How can I be so stupid?! It's all about trust. Junsu wanted to scream when he saw the rings. But all he did was cry. Yoochun hugged Junsu tightly. So much that Junsu's body could break. Junsu touched Yoochun's pretty face and said ""Chunnie, I'm sorry. Stop crying. It's my fault. I know that you love me but still I acted that way. You're my world Chunnie. I can never last a day without you."" Yoochun pulled Junsu into a passionate kiss. When their lips parted, Yoochun held Junsu's hands and placed the ring in his finger. ""Su, I love you."" he said in a soft lovely voice. ""I love you too Chunnie. I will never leave you."" And they kissed again. The 4 walls of their room are the only ones who knew what happened that night. There was no choice for the 4 walls but to notice love in action.</p><p>-o-</p><p>""I told you think positive!"" Changmin said in a jolly voice.<br />""Yeah! Thank you Changminnie."" Jaejoong smiled and worked on his beautiful eyes. <br />""Aaaah. Stop it. Don't give me that look. Maybe I should do this, an extra income ne?""Changmin pouted.<br />""Whatever you say Changminnie."" Jaejoong ingnored the pouting Changmin. <br />""Aish. I should get paid! I fixed another problem! Gimme money!"" Changmin extended his hands visible enough for Jaejoong.<br />""Tell Yunho! Huh!"" Jaejoong shouted.<br />""No! He won't give me!"" Changmin shouted back.<br />""Shut up! Here have food instead!"" Jaejoong shoved food into Changmin's mouth.<br />""Aish! Mone--- Wow this is delicious!"" And Changmin began chewing on large pieces of the meat.<br />""Shut up and eat!"" Jaejoong prepared more for Changmin. <br />""Thanks hyung!"" He was grinning.</p><p>Changmin and his food. ""This is love!"" Changmin said and continued eating. </p><p>-END-</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>it's my first time of writing a fic. x_x i'm sorry if it sucks. comments are loved &lt;333<br /></p>"

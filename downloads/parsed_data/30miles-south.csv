"event","So im in bermuda right now, i just got back from the beach.&nbsp; It has been lots of fun, last night especially. We went on this like ""Dont stop the carnival"" cruise thingy, where there was like a live regge band and BBQ buffet, and towards the middle of the night there was a limbo contest.&nbsp; They were picking people from the audience to participate and just my luck, they picked me (i am the worst limboer ever, and i had a skirt on).&nbsp; Sooooo it was me up there with like all of these adults adn then to "" loosen us up"" for the limbo the dancers made us do these weird dance moves and we had to practically hump all the people in front of us in front of like the 150 people or more that went. Anyway, when the limbo came they made this whole bog deal when i went b/c i had on a skirt and i went the opposite way from everyone and all of the guys in the contest had to turn around.&nbsp; SO at the end when they were crowing a limbo king and queen, the guy that picked me found out that i was only in high school ( and the prize was like little bottles of rum) and it was funny because when i said i graduated in 2007 he was like, Oooooooooo.&nbsp; Yea so ill have picutres when i come home, but if u want to see some picks of the thing, and the people i limboed with go to&nbsp; <A href=""http://www.hawkinsisland.com"">www.hawkinsisland.com</A> and click the pictures and go to July 5th.&nbsp; Ok i g2g other people want ot use the comp , byeeee, be home friday."

"event","so yesterday me and kathy decided since we started off the summer by blowing all our cash, we should do the same thing at the end of the summer. So we decided to go out for dinner.  ME, kat m and vin decided to go to Cozymels (mexican food).  When they brought us to our table they put us in this empty room like isolated form the rest of the restaurant. I figureed they must have thought we were troublesome teenagers and wanted to hide us, haha.  After that we went to COld Stone Creamery in the source.  IT was preety good.  Then we went in the mall and walked around for a while. We went in the dollar store there and found the coolest sign ever.  It said ""ITs the BIG one"" It may not seam that funny, but there is the old guy in my block who always says that, and we got a kick out of it.  Well now im gonna go attempt to do my summer assignment, and hopefully tonight we can go bowling. Haa ha, the only reason i m writing this journal is to procrastinate doing my summer asignment."

"event","<P>Soo, Saturday was my block party. I'd have to say it was one of te most interesting ones in a while.&nbsp; There was soo much drama, almost too much for me to handle.&nbsp; Well the morning was all good. We just hung out and had a little fun soaking Kathy with my waterguns. Later that day things got a little bit more interesting.&nbsp; So it turns out that sometime in the afternoon Kristen broke up with Keith because he was cheating on her with some other girl. So Keiths bad behavior led Kristen cousin Erin and her friend to want to have a little talk with him.&nbsp; During this little talk Keith spit at their feet. After he did this Erin's friend poured her beer all over him.</P>

And i&nbsp;got to ride&nbsp;the pony!&nbsp; At about 7 Ilienne and John came over.&nbsp; We just hung out and had somefood.&nbsp; Ohh nad we played hot potato.&nbsp; I didnt think that a game of hot potato could be so fun.&nbsp; It was us three and then like 20 other&nbsp;5 year olds.&nbsp; Well Ilienne got out early on in the game but me and John lasted a long time.&nbsp; Actually i was in the last two.&nbsp; And i won!! but i felt bad because the girl i was against was like 3 so i pretended to loose.&nbsp; But just becuase we lost we got kool tatoos. </P>

<P>Any way to make a long story short. Nicole who keep in mind is 12, got really drunk and started to puke at the corner.&nbsp; Then her mom came down and took her and her sister kathy home to yell at them.&nbsp; Also there were all these other little kids that were drunk too.&nbsp; Then later on , from what i hear, keith punched some girl in the face and made her bleed.&nbsp; That punch caused a huge fight later on in the night.&nbsp; After everyone had left Ann, some girls mom came to talk to keith about when he punched the girl.&nbsp; Well keith, instead of beng a good kid and just&nbsp;listening he hd to say, "" why dont u make me"" to the mom every 5 seconds.&nbsp; With keith being such an idiot his brother brian kept telling him to shut up and this just caused another fight.&nbsp; Well keith and brian were going at it for like 15 min when keith threw a punch at brian right in the jaw.&nbsp; Right before this he threw his stateboard at him.&nbsp; Well after the punch brian went home after attempting to kill his brother but was kicked out by a neighbor.&nbsp; Well i cant really explain any more , but lets just say it was a very interesting day.&nbsp; </P>

"event","Hi!!! So nothing really interesting has happened lately.  But the other day me, kathy, vin , eric , and brian camped out in my backyard.  It was pretty cool, we set up a tent and made a little fire in this pit in my backyard.  It was cool.  Eric and brian left at  like 12 and vin stayed till 2.  Hahah kathy fell asleep at like 12:30 so me and vin were torchering her. Thats what she gets for falling asleep so early.  Other than that things have been pretty dull around here.  OOOoo tuesday all of us were hanging out in my basement when we herd the little kids in my backyard.  We decided to spy on the through my neighbors fence.  Well it turns out they were playing a little game of truth or dare.  I think the girls flashed the guys like 3 times.  And my brother kept mooning people.  Then as we were spying vin decided to go get his camera.  By the time we got back they dissapeared.  They went in the basement, which we were just hanging out in. So we figured in order to get them out of the basement we should blackmail them by pretending we had what they were doing in the back on tape.  ONce we told them me brother was soo upset he ran into the laundry room crying.  THe looks of horror on the other kids faces was priceless.  I wish i had a camera.  Well we got back the basement, and at like 11:30 there was a blackout.  SO we had to find our way out of the basement.  It was kinda cool.  Anyway that night my mom gave me a little lecture on how blackmail is cruel and evil. I think is so typical that the younger kids can me flashing each other in my own backyard and im the one getting in trouble for it."

Once she died her neighbors baught the house and really never did any thig with it.&nbsp; All the kids on my block would always kid around on how we thought it was haunted after the woman died.&nbsp; Anyway, thats all u need to know for backroind info.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soo yesterday Vin noticed that the people that owned the house were finally starting to clean it out.&nbsp; He noticed that on the curb&nbsp; there were boxes and boxes filled with lidless jars.&nbsp; Well with the speculation that the house was haunted we thought that soo many jars was a little strange. Then we started joking around how she might have kept body parts in the jars or something. And Vin, being&nbsp;the idiot he is, said that maybe if we took a picture of the jars that the ghosts of the people would show&nbsp;up in them.&nbsp; To prove to vin that he was loosing it i decided to go over there and take the pix.&nbsp; After i took them we pluged the cmaera into my computer&nbsp;when i noticed something&nbsp;weird in this one&nbsp;jar.&nbsp; It looked like a face.&nbsp; Anyway to shorten it up we took a few more and the face kep showing up.&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds stupid, but i am soo afraid.&nbsp; The first two look like dogs but then the rest have this little girls face in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We negatived the pictures because&nbsp;it was easier to see the faces. </P>

It was pretty weird because originally me, kathy, and vin were talking about crashing it, or just like showing up dressed really weird even though we havent talk to our neighbor whose house it was for like 3 years.  Then next thing you no we get this phone call from  our friend saying that nicole(the party was at her house) said we should come over.  It was really ironic, so we decided to go over.  We didnt really no anyone who was at the party so when we first went in this girl tryed to kick us out. Then she realized that we were friends of nicole and she wouldnt stop apologizing.  She was really drunk too so that made it even funnier.  Every time she would pass us in the house she would say; ""I'm soooo sorry i tried to kick yhou guys out before"" and she said that at least 20 times. I's have to say that she was my favorite drunk person there. I really didnt do much there, me, kathy, and vin made friends with a few other drunk people and just hung out there.  There was this one kid who was smoking a cigar in nicoles backyard and he was looking at me through the window making all of these stupid faces.  Haha, he looked really stupid, but i still have no idea of what he was trying to tell me.  At about 12 we decided to leave.  IT was only when i left i realized how drunk kathy was.  She wsa being soo stupid. After i finally got her to go in her house she went online and kept asking vin to sleepover her house.  I saw the conversation this morning and it was hysterical. WEll it was an interesting new experience and i learned one lesson.  Drunk people are really funny."

   I was looking around my room the other day and i found some old friendship bracelts and i thought, i should make some new ones. SOo yesterday me and my mom went to Michael's and got some of the string you use for the bracelets and i made one. The braclet making stops me from gettting too bored.
   Aside from the boring mornings the nights have been ok.  I usually just hang out with some people on the block. Some nights we wonder arouns Williston Park in search of something interesting to do. One day we actually did find somehting, an new ice cream place. Now we go there a lot, its pretty cool; they have leather couches.
   Tomorrow is the 4th of July, i dont have anything big planned.  I think my parents r gonna do antother fire in my backyard.  Otherwise i probably just hang out with Kathy since everyone else has plans."

Originally Greg and i were going to go to center street to visit some of our old teachers but then Ilienne called me and asked me to go to a show in her friends backyard, so me and my brother never went. But i promised him we would go tomorrow so that should be okay. Anyway the backyard show was ok.  Ilienne, John, and I were very unsociable and didnt really talk to anyone. And then this one kid came up to us to say hi and called us the people that no one was talking to.  I wonder if thats what everyone there was calling us? Ilienne's other friend Jackie's little brother Nolan was annoying us so much.  Haha, he kept throwing beach balls at us. Otherwisw it was pretty boring until the bands came.  When the NSG played there was this really tall weird looking guy with a HUGE orange fro. The way it was bouncing was distracting me to much and i was getting really angry. But the highlight of my night was the trampoline they had in there backyard.  It was soo much fun. I hadnt been on a trampoline in such a long time, i forgot how much fun it was.  After the NSG played the cops came and told us we were too loud.  After another band played they came again and finally told us the music had to stop.  Then her mom kicked everyone out of her backyard. Then we waited in front of Jackie's house for like half and hour to be picked up.

"event","Yesterday was DFP8 (dysfunctional family picnic), it was sooo much fun.&nbsp; Taking Back Sunday was great and so were all of the other bands. The Darkness was the by far the most entertaining.&nbsp; Oh, and one of the guys from Taking Back Sunday passed right in front of me, Ilienne, and John and we didnt even say anything.&nbsp; The festival syle part of it was so much more fun than the part in the stadium.&nbsp; There was lots of crowd surfing and of course pooh bear, haha. I had a great time, lots of fun."

"event","Well it turns out that half of the information i got from nicole was all bullshit. The kids werent as horny as i expected. Some of the stuff she told me seemed unrealistic so i checked with some other kids to see if she was telling the truth, and it turns out she was lying.  They really werent doing stuff that was that bad.  It was just a relativly innocent game of truth or dare. I just dont understand why she would lie about something like that.  She is making her self out to be such a whore.  Well i was freaking out for nothing and now i feel much better.  Those kids, they're not as bad as i thought."

"event","OMG..those dam little kids down the block are horny bastards. They are only in 6th and 7th grade and man..the stuff they r doing in thier own backyards. I new they were very ""comfrotable"" around each other, but what happened tonight is just messed up. 
   Ok so it started when me n kathy saw that all of the little kids were in kristen's jacuzzi.  So of course being the older siblings it was our natural instinct to go n spy on them to see what they were doing.  We decided to go up onto kathy's roof which has a perfect view of the jacuzzi that the little kids were in.  At first they didnt see us n we could see exactly what they were doing, playihhng an innocent game of truth or dare; or so we thought. As the night went on they eventually saw us and tried to make us leave, but we wouldnt let them get rid of us that easy.  So we waited on the roof watching their game.  Then they started to form a blockade so me and kathy couldnt see what they were doing.  We figured all they were doing was kissing or whatever.. nothing big. So after an hour or so we got tired of sitting up there so we left, not suspecting anything. 
  Later after all of the little kids went in me n kathy were sitting on her stoop when nicole came out.  She decided thatshe could tell us what exactily happened behind that boundry the kids were making.  Im not gonna get into detail but lets just say they were doing more than just kissing.  I think i will be scared for life. Even worse for eternity.  I really dont wanna get intodetail but i will never be able to look at them the same way again.  There only 12 yrs old!! hoebags"

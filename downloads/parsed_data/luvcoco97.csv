"event","You are an Idealist.

Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self -- always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.

Idealists are sure that friendly cooperation is the best way for people to achieve their goals. Conflict and confrontation upset them because they seem to put up angry barriers between people. Idealists dream of creating harmonious, even caring personal relations, and they have a unique talent for helping people get along with each other and work together for the good of all. Such interpersonal harmony might be a romantic ideal, but then Idealists are incurable romantics who prefer to focus on what might be, rather than what is. The real, practical world is only a starting place for Idealists; they believe that life is filled with possibilities waiting to be realized, rich with meanings calling out to be understood. This idea of a mystical or spiritual dimension to life, the ""not visible"" or the ""not yet"" that can only be known through intuition or by a leap of faith, is far more important to Idealists than the world of material things.

Highly ethical in their actions, Idealists hold themselves to a strict standard of personal integrity. They must be true to themselves and to others, and they can be quite hard on themselves when they are dishonest, or when they are false or insincere. More often, however, Idealists are the very soul of kindness. Particularly in their personal relationships, Idealists are without question filled with love and good will. They believe in giving of themselves to help others; they cherish a few warm, sensitive friendships; they strive for a special rapport with their children; and in marriage they wish to find a ""soulmate,"" someone with whom they can bond emotionally and spiritually, sharing their deepest feelings and their complex inner worlds.

Idealists are rare, making up between 25 and 30 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers."

"event","Okay, so I succumb to getting an lj, although I have reservations about how diligently I'll post in it.  But I'm going through Wellesley withdrawal, so this seems like the easiest way that I can keep in touch with a lot of people with little to no effort.  I already miss my noodlers a lot, and I hope that I'll be able to talk with them often.

I thought an lj would also be handy to record my job hunting experience.  Honey gave me ""What Color is Your Parachute"" as a graduation present, the best I have ever gotten.  It's a much needed roadmap for me since I'm incredibly lost right now. I'm going through the book, doing some of the exercises, and I thought it would be convenient to record some of the stuff I learn along the way here.

Right now I'm just trying to figure out what I would be good at doing, or what I would enjoy doing.  As my Econ prof said, people spend most of their life at their jobs, so it's in our best interest to love what we are doing.

This is what the Princeton Career search had to say about me (http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/quiz/career_quiz_results.asp):
  
People with blue Interests like job responsibilities and occupations that involve creative, humanistic, thoughtful, and quiet types of activities. Blue Interests include abstracting, theorizing, designing, writing, reflecting, and originating, which often lead to work in editing, teaching, composing, inventing, mediating, clergy, and writing.    
       
People with yellow styles perform their job responsibilities in a manner that is orderly and planned to meet a known schedule. They prefer to work where things get done with a minimum of interpretation and unexpected change. People with a yellow style tend to be orderly, cautious, structured, loyal, systematic, solitary, methodical, and organized, and usually thrive in a research-oriented, predictable, established, controlled, measurable, orderly environment. You will want to choose a work environment or career path in which your style is welcomed and produces results.

The RHETI test tells me that I'm:
Type 2: The Helper. The caring, nurturing type.
Followed closely by
Type 9: The Peacemaker. The easygoing, accommodating type.
 
Hmm, I'm not sure I see the helpfulness of this.  Plus, the computer is giving me a headache.  I think I will go take a break now.  :)"

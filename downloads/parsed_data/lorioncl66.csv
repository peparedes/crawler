"event","so i've pretty much become feed up with my life. no matter how hard i try things just arent making me happy. I should be making better choices with my life but i find myself sitting at home wondering what is the point to the sacrifice i make. I feel like my ""friends"" arent who i thought they are, and my real ""friends"" left me behind to continue their respective lives and i'm left in the dust because i cant follow down the same road they took. So here i sit in front of my computer screen drunk and having to go to work in 3 and a half hours while my ""friends"" are having a good time. dont get me wrong they have every right to have a good time and i in fact envy them but it just feels like as i'm leaving that once again i'm am being left behind. i'm starting to think that i should just do my own thing and forget the whole theory that is a ""friend"" because i will find myself in the same position night in and night out, left behind while everyone else is doing their own thing. in looking at my friends i envy them because they are their own group and even after the days, months and years i have spent hanging out with them i am not a part of that members only club. i dont know but waking up seems like a chore and the only reason i'm doing it is because i cant afford not to. whatever."

"event","so i had today off and i think it was both a blessing and a curse. a blessing because i was given the opportunity to take a test and take a big step in going back to college and moving on with my life. I even got all my laundry done, messed around on my bass, and sat back and reflect. well i didnt take my test and when you reflect on that things dont always seem good. I came to the conclusion that i'm almost 21 years old still not in school, hate my job, and am just not generally satisfied with my life. dont get me wrong i loved sitting at home and not having any thing i needed to attend to but in a way thats not good. also i need to get out of my house something fierce. i cant put up with stupidity anymore and my home is a breeding grounds for it. my job sucks some major ass. i cant stand this guy i work with, he makes me hate people and i dont trust him for shit. i am actually getting better hours and then all of a sudden i have to work late while a person that has been there less gets off before me. shes a fat bitch anyways so i guess i win in the end. venting on lj actually made me feel a little better. I'll take my damn test monday and we will see where it goes. i'm not contempt not being in school and the only upside is i have a job and am not completely wasting my life. anyways my rant is over and i'm off to end this day and start a new one."

I cant join the marines due to have 4 too many concussions and a metal plate in my arm, so there goes my four year plan. and i am just sick and tired of everyone bitching about shit but not fixing it, they are just doing it for attention. also i'm done helping people out fuck them. i'm just done. i will be unreachable for the next month or so. not because i'm leaving i am just chosing to not talk to anybody for a while. i need to figure some shit out and i'm just done dealing with stupid bullshit involving the people around me. my best friends are all marines and now i cant join them and i'm left here with people that just bitch and bitch. so i'm just walking away from it all. I'll get back to you when i get my shit together."

Anyways, i have offcially lost 21 pounds in about a month and only 15 more to go before January 5 and i can offcially DEP into the Marines. and then another 16 to go before March to actually ship off to recruit training. I would be lying if i said i wasnt looking forward to this. and on a different note some crazy black cracked out lady threatened to shoot me and then tried to hit me with the car that she was getting away in. Its kind of a long story but those details are the only important ones. Best part my partner that i was working with was like ""ive been doing this job for 8 years and that is the first time someone threatened to shoot me."" my response was as follows.....""Welcome to Southfield.""

"event","So i recently made a decision to better my life and make the next step and all i have heard since then is ""thats stupid"" ""or what a waste"" in so many words. there has been like 4 people that have supported my decision to do this. I just dont understand its like people dont give a fuck when your there but the minute you make a decision that they dont like all of a sudden they are your best friend or they care the most about you. what the fuck is up with that. if i did the research and talked to people and i made an educated decision, then fuck off. i'm not that kind of person that plunges head first and thinks about the long term effects. i made sure that this will help me in the long run and i'm taking a big step in growing up and getting into my career. its not gunna be easy but nothing in life worth having comes easy. so for those of you that are reading this wondering what the hell i'm talking about here it is........

"event","so i've come to terms that in my line of work you have to not give a shit about other people and what they say. and i think that is why i've been in such a shitty mood for so long. i mean today i helped ruin a kids life because he was 17 and we prosecuted him. and i never felt bad for him. he was crying and the cop cuffed him and i was laughing the entire time. i've had people steal so they could feed their families and i honestly never gave a shit because i really dont care. has the world gone so far downhill that there are few honest people left in it? and its really bad when i cant trust some of the people i work with let alone know. take me back to the good old days before people were stabbing each other in the back just to better themselves. i'm talking about the times when money didnt really matter because i didnt have a need for it. the days where i could count on my friends to be there to hangout. i just have little hope for the future."

Joe is doing real good busting his ass and dealing with Mongo that piece of mexican shit that would rather pet lamps then work but whatever. oh and in other news my trans went on my car so now i need to find a new car because that is a total of 4,000$ of repairs that i need to make on my car so i am saying fuck that and looking to get a brand spanking new car. but the bright side was i drank like a fish last night and didnt get called into work today so i got to sleep off my hangover. well i'm done rambling and venting so Till next time."

"event","Everyone has a crutch. What happens when that crutch finally fails? This is a question i was found asking myself today. The reason being is that I finally said ""no"" to my job about covering someone else's shift. As I thought about it I realized that I'm the crutch that my step-dad uses at work. They all know that if they needed someone to cover a shift or something needs to get done dump it on Bryan. Well that changed today, probably for the worse because my step-dad is pissed because he had to wash dishes. Now the shock wave starts where they have to find someone else to depend on. Its not just at work though, most of my friends or family even, know that when it comes down to it and they needed something done that they can count on me. Every time I have made that sacrifice and done whatever it was that was needed. So today I just snapped and realized that I need a break. The emotional burden was way too much for me to handle. I am normally known for being clutch, cool under pressure and dependable but not anymore. It has gotten me no where but walked all over. I cant be that guy anymore because I have no support to lean on. So now I feel like a failure and am really out of it. what the hell is wrong with me?

"event","ok so a little bit has changed since last time. i am no longer going to albion because of some personal reasons. mainly the school just wasnt for me. i have made the career decision to be a cop or join the FBI or something. i got a job as a dishwasher at bon vie. which is a fancy resturant in summerset mall. it is actually pretty fun. christmas was christmas, i am not a big fan of that holiday. i dont really have that many resoultions. i need to start running more. i can feel myself getting fat even though i only eat about once or twice a day. other than that i have just been the same old bryan. well till next time."

"event","so its been a little bit since my last update. some things have happend. for our last game we won at home. i have been extremly bored now that football doesnt take up 80 percent of my time. i had to meet with the coaches to talk about the season and how i did. the best part was that my o-line coach said i have real talent and that if i work at it i can be a contributer to the team for the next three years. now what makes that great is that he coached for none other than the late great Bo schembecler. yeah so they guy knows what he is talking about. then my head coach said that he was glad that i made albion my choice of colleg and that he is really glad that i am playing for him. which is cool because the guy is a hardass. other than that i will be home on tuesday. so yeah . till next time."

"event","so once again it happend again. i put myself out there with a girl and what happens. i am left alone because she decided that she would rater go out with some guy that she didnt like. wtf. i knew it was going to happen, but i was told it wouldnt, i figured it would be differen this time. it ended the same way as always. i even said that i wouldnt go bowling because i didnt want to ditch her. fuck that. on top of that we lost today to a team that is our biggest rival. by five points. this has been the worst day. the only shred of this day that was good was the fact that i purchased a condom dispenser for my room because i think it would be awesome to have. but no that was overshadowed by the fact that some girl who i really liked wanted to be a bitch and screw me over. damn this is such shit. till next time."

"event","so my roomate dropped out. the game went great yesterday. i put a kid in the hospital. was coming across on a block and a middle linebacker was blocked into me, so i did what was natural, i headbutted the shit out of him and he was knocked out. i dropped my first college pass. i was really nervous and got scared. we won the game and i played a lot more than usual. so now i am sitting in my room alone because i dont have anyone to live with but that is no big deal. anyways i am doing a lot better which is expected because i took out my anger on some unsuspecting kid. well that is all."

"event","so college life is really starting to suck. a few updates are, that i am ready to quit football, i am ready to drop out of collge, and i am not really enjoying myself anymore. football is ok, i work my ass off but really dont get any respect from the team. every girl i go after here ends up liking my roommate or someone else that is not me, after they lead me on to belive that they like me. in other news my roommate got arrested. i dont know what charges were made against him but they cant be good. tomorrow is the last home jv football game and i am pretty nervous because i might actually get to play. i have just been in a down mood lately because i really dont have that many friends here and they are not that good of friends. and the one girl that i really liked ended up not wanting anything to do with me after she acted like she was interested. i got to deal with it and maybe i will take some kids head off tomorrow. that is why i love football all this frustration is going to be taken out on some unsuspecting kid tomorrow. sucks to be him. and sucks to be me at the moment."

"event","So i dont really know anymore. i have been in a good mood for a long time but as it usually goes it must come to an end. i am still enjoying college but it is dificult to go through with no football, no friends that i can really hangout with. i am starting to miss everyone back home. i am still having troubles trying to get a girl which is really nothing new. i feel like even bigger crap for writing all this in here because i shouldnt complain about my problems to anyone that is willing to listen. i dont know maybe once i get back into football i will be better. i will be home friday so maybe that will cheer me up. but until then i will talk to them later. well until next time."

"event","i am not really sure how many people still read this thing but for those that are interested. i got my first concussion yesterday. needless to say it was in football. it was sweet. i got hit and i dont remember a lot of details. but i walked off the field and tried to act tough. then i fell over and the trainers came and helped me to go get checked out. now time for the scary part. while i was being checked out my neck started to hurt really bad. so i told sara (the trainer) and she told me to lay down. well to make a long story short they called the ambulance as a precaution and my neck was just sore from the whiplash. so right now i am just really sore and out of football for a couple of days i think. to those of you that read this thanks and dont worry i am ok. i think"

"event","Ok, yes, getting much frustrated.

For the baby shower, my Aunt Pam gave me a $75 gift card to target (much wootage!).

SO, I went online to get some stuff on Monday (not knowing I'd be delivering Tuesday...), a nursing cover, some lasinoh stuff, and two nursing bras.

I check off that I want standard 3-5 business days shipping, I'm in no rush (well, I wasn't at the time!), so I figure that amount of time is *plenty*.  

April 7 in the morning, I find out that the nursing cover and the lasinoh stuff is in transit--woot!  Much awesome.  But then I see the nursing bras are due to go out...somewhere between May 8 and May 27????

Dwah?    Considering the stuff I ordered was in stock...why is it being sent out so ... LATE?

Well, now apparently the stuff that's already in transit?  It's not due to get here until May 27th.  It's currently in San Francisco.

....Ok, so 3-5 day shipping means a month and a half?  And since when is it going to take a month and a half to get from San Fran to Longview????  I can WALK to San Fran from here *faster* than that!

And the nursing bras still have not been shipped.

So I cancelled them.  I figure I'm better off going to the Three Rivers Mall to the Target *there*, and just buying them in town.  Ugh!"

"event","So this week is going to be promise full of craziness.

Managed to go to the zoo on Saturday and had a great time with Warren (whose favorite is..? Yeah, still the sea lions).  They really seem to be trying to get a lot of the construction done before the summer really hits.  The African predators area is really coming along.  I can't wait to actually see them have lions back there again after so many years of them being absent.  Also getting cheetahs, and hyenas--two of which they never had.  It's just shame their Leopard passed on earlier this year.

What I'm wondering is if they're going to put the Alaskan Tundra back up with the grizzly bear, wolves and other animals---it seems they're putting the african predators right where the Alaskan tundra used to be. o_O  We shall see I suppppooooze.  (Though it's kind of sad, for being known internationally for being the first zoo to breed Asian Elephants, their elephant pen is just looking *sad*...as are the elephants..)

Sunday we got a *ton* of yardwork in the backyard done--edging, mowing, weeding.  Cleaned off the winter-mildew that builds up on the white railing on the porch, too.  We still need to borrow the weed-whacker from my in-laws so we can get the edge of the lawn.  We'll probably do that after the in-laws are in Hawaii.  I still have a lot I want to do in the front yard--including weeding and planting some new bulbs and seeds in some of the blank spots of dirt in the front gardens.  Strawberries are coming in nice, and if you don't want cats peeing or pooing in your garden, white vinegar is a really effective way to keep them out without hurting them (we have...a massive army of strays in Longview...and on top of that we have a lot of owners who just lock their cats out all day..almost all night..).

We *still* do not have our tax return, so I got fed up and went to track it down at the IRS website. It's not due to even be sent out until April 10.  So I'm thinking the weekend of May 18...so I guess that'd be the 16th and the 17th as my birthday's on a Monday..or the following weekend..I'm going to throw a fence-moving-garden-planting-party.  Maybe get the in-law brothers to help Bryan with the fence while the girls rip up the grass, lay down chicken wire (see the cat complaint above), and start planting some rows of seeds.  I'm even contemplating letting Bryan plant a dwarf peach or dwarf apple tree--though I'm not sure *where*.  I'm hoping to get it mostly done in one day, and I should feel a little better or at least be a little more mobile since Leah will be born by then.

Speaking of Leah!  (LL Bean according to <lj user=""leahamazon""> )  Yesterday she started deciding that I might be ready to go into labor.  When Warren was born, around 2 a.m. (and close to ..what..2 days away from the due date?) I started having pretty regular contractions, about ...eeehhh, 30 seconds in length and about ten to fifteen minutes apart.  We waited around til' 5 since they kept going, and then drove to the hospital, were admitted, yadda yadda, the contractions tried to slow and go away after spending most of the day there, so the doctor's just asked us if we wanted to be induced since we were already there.  Not wanting to pay for *two* hospital visits, and Bryan already missing a day of work, yeah, we decided to induce.  Warren was born by midnight.

Now, yesterday morning, around...uuhhh...5:30 a.m.?  I started having 15 second long contractions for an hour, every 3 minutes.  Full on, back achin', breath stealing contractions.  And I'm thinking...""....uhwhat?""  Since she's not due til' the end of this month.  So I call mom, letting her know--hey, these aren't Braxton Hicks contractions, might want to come visit me for the day just in case.  She came up--and thank God she did--and we got all the packing done, last minute stuff in Leah's room done (as early labor contractions for me aren't debilitating, but they certainly make you pause), she unwrapped the new car seat, ate lunch, helped me take care of Warren, and around 1:30 she drove me down to an appointment I already had set for yesterday at 2:30. 

<lj-cut text=""a little TMI doc visit stuff"">
As background, they've been eyeing me like a hawk circling it's prey since I started showing signs of Preclampsia. Had me fill a 24 hour urine sample (Yay, jug-o-pee!) and bring it back yesterday

I get there, turn in my labwork, and after that we head up to visit the nurse...where she checks my blood pressure (it's gone down, yay!), talk about the random contractions (which, at this point in the day, are being rather sporadic in timing), ask about the headaches I was having last week, the vision changes I was starting to notice *with* my glasses on at Saturday night, the swelling, the lumbar pains, the pelvic pains, etc etc etc.  Oddly I had all of the symptoms of preclampsia except no pain up in the right side of my chest and the fact that my blood pressure was down, so the doc let me go home.  

</lj-cut>

They told me not to come into the hospital unless I have regular 45 second contractions every 10 minutes for over an hour--simply because it's my second pregnancy and because we live 45 minutes from the hospital.

So yeah, we stop by walgreens on the way home and mom bought me a pump (yay!  I'm hoping to pump a little before she's born this time so I won't have a repeat of what happened with Warren), and we get....about to Battleground when my husband calls and says ""OH btw, did you get your labs done at the clinic?""

""....labs?  Um, you mean the jug..?""
""No, ah, they asked if you got some bloodwork done while you were there..""
""...you're $#!tt!ng me...""
"" I take that as a no...?""
""CRAP.  No, nobody told me I had more labs to take..""

So I called them while mom turned the car around, and of course I was on hold by the time we got BACK to the clinic as was, so I just went in anyway.  While I'm sitting there, I hear the clerk at the desk talking to the ladies up in OB/GYN and stating ""I can't find any lab orders for Erica Parks.."" ...I almost jumped up and said ""That's it, I quit!"" when she found them being ordered under a nurse instead of my doctor.  Yeah, got two vials of blood drawn, got home, passed out at seven with hubby.

And today?  No contractions.  Nadda blessed thing.  Mom's betting she'll come tomorrow because she's taking the dog in to get spayed at 8 a.m. and that's the day my MIL is hopping a plane to go to Hawaii.  She says that or Friday because she has to teach that day.  My irony would have it happen on Easter after finally going out and getting all the stuff for Warren and planning on having a day of pictures and outdoor fun with him assuming the weather holds up.  At this point, however, I'm beginning to think it won't happen this week at all.  *pokes Leah* Willl you make up your MINNDD?

But yes, on a side note, I've been ordered to 'take it easy.'

Is that even possible with a 2 year old????

----------------

Addendum:  So the lady at the clinic just called and said ""You know, we didn't get your blood drawn yesterday, I just couldn't believe it when you turned in your stuff they didn't take your blood"" 

""OOOOOOOHHHH yes I did.""

""You did? OH, OH thank goodness..""

"event","...that constantly vote for higher property taxes (And I could care less WHAT the tax is for, it's still not coming out of your pocket)

Thank you.

Because of you, it's very likely we're going to go into forclosure because we cannot afford to pay our taxes.

Before, with taxes, we were able to barely scrape by.  As it is we had to move into another county, 45 minutes away from my husband's work in order to be able to afford a home.  

Now our taxes, due to the last measures and levies and other BS pork thrown into such things, that I will likely *never* see the benefit from, and because the treasurer--when all of the properties in the counties around us are going DOWN in value--decided that ours went up in value by THIRTY THOUSAND dollars.  Our taxes have jumped by over $600 this year.

To pay it at half would be nearly as much as our monthly mortgage payment, which we can barely afford.  So instead of trying to do some *basic* fixing of our house, instead *all* of our tax return money is going STRAIGHT BACK into PROPERTY TAXES.  I can't even afford to buy seeds for a garden that might help us reduce grocery costs in the fall.  

Oh, but you might be eligible of government programs, you say?  Even if I wanted to do that, we earn just..*slightly* too much.  By how much?  Probably $100 a month. 

I hope your rent triples.

"event","So I've been noticing that Warren does a little bit of both with his hands.

When he eats, he always holds his utensils with his left hand, when he colors, he uses both hands but predominantly his right hand.  Plays with his cars?  Usually with his right hand.  But there are days where he'll totally switch it up on me and use his left hand dominantly and his right hand will only be a brief afterthought.

Honestly, it doesn't bother me either way.  If he wants to be a Lefty, a Righty, ambidextrious (sp?), as long as he's comfortable with how it's done y'know?

Apparently I'm a rarity in that thought...???  Every time I turn around, somebody (No, nobody who reads this) seems to say ""Well, which hand are you going to train him to use?"" ...

""....dwah?""  Why on earth should I train him to use a certain hand over the other???  I figure when it comes to learning to write, I'll hand him the pencil and just go from there...

I get all sorts of odd looks when I say I'm not going to, I've gotten a few ""That's *weird*"" Comments when I tell them he switches his hands often...

Why on earth is it so weird?  I'm pretty sure we got passed the whole phase of left handed people are from the devil concept a good while ago.  I know that it's a little more difficult for Lefties to find the right sort of school gear (scissors in particular), but I know they're out there.  Why on earth should I force my kid to be a righty?

"event","Ok, so Warren's birthday was fun yesterday--not nearly as overwhelming and crazy as the year before's.  (T'was so nice)  I did cupcakes instead of cake, and the three tots  that were there delved into it with much fervor.  It was also nice that after cake and presents were done, they all three went off to play together, letting the adults have some adult time.

Thought it was funny, Warren's known how to say thank you for a while now, and usually does it at the appropriate times when you give him something.  But I don't think he's quite got the concept that opening a gift is also somebody giving you something, so I'm not surprised that every time I said ""Say thank you"" he'd ignore me. ;P  But the funny thing is that I'd say that, and Royce would run over to me, say ""Thank you!"" and run off again. XD

(Ah, and Sarah? The PJs totally fit, if you were worried at all)

Bry and his dad and brother worked...predominantly on the garage (the door is a bit busted) before and after the party, so I had in-laws and my parents there for a good chunk of the day (I would have gone crazy without mom and MIL there, they saved my bacon!).  

Bad news? My vaccuum died.  I'm not sure if it's capable of being resurrected.  Luckily mom brought her vaccuum over to let me vaccuum before guests arrived, but unluckily it is muddy and dirty outside with a few leftover leaves that I have not gotten rid of on the porch, so everybody trailed in a little bit of stuff.   And...now I have no vaccuum to clean it up. XP

Now, we're trying to recoop from yesterday, Bryan is sore from lifting the garage door up and down all over the place yesterday, and I'm just downright worn out from playing hostess.  Warren's even a bit tired because he had two other boys here to play with, which gave him just excuse to run amuck. ;)

Apparently in my grandma's 'non-injury fall' last night she broke her back.  They're apparently going to put her into a brace and ...um, something along those lines?  Mom said she'd call to update me ...hopefully she'll be ok *wince*

As for the rest of the night?  Seriously considering just...laying here.  For a while at least.  Soooo tired."

Apparently just enough that the kids got the day off from school *glances to her neighbors now emerging to play*

I think I'll be letting Warren out to play in it now that he has his waterproof warm winter stuffs. (Bought it just in time apparently, snowsuits are INSANELY expensive!!  72 dollars for a winter coat and snow pants in size 3T.  Thank goodness it was 50% off, 35 is much more reasonable ;) )

So it looks like they won't let Bryan out, on the news it's showing most of the roads in Clark County are pretty bare.  But of course...just  north of Woodland (where WE are) is alll sorts of snow and issues on I-5.

Just hope he makes it home safe. >_<

(Yes, I know people in more snowy areas are probably laughing at my concern, but when you live in an area that *rarely* gets snow, it's a bit of a concern.)"

"event","Ok, so Jenn, after I was making snarky comments on the trailer, sent me the books.

I'm having...a really hard time reading the first one seriously.  There's soooo many glowering errors that it's driving me mad.  Not gramatically, and in the literary sense, Stephanie Meyer wrote a very good story, and a very good book.

The problem is...I don't think she really did hardly *any* research on the area she based it in.  Granted, she can have her own attitude about the area, as somebody coming from Phoenix to Forks, WA I can understand why the world suddenly seems so glum and grey.  That's not what's bothering me.

<lj-cut text=""Not really a rant, more or less musings..."">
Keep in mind I've only gotten to chapter 11 as of last night.  I'm not even half way through the danged book.

Ok, on the first page she states, flat out, why she chose Forks.  ""It rains on this unconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America.""  -- Describing Forks.  Yes, that's true, and eeeverybody who's ever been there or lives in that area knows that.  But, like the rest of WA it does get a few months of sun in the summer.  So I can't quite follow the time of year.  You get the impression at first that she's coming in near the beginning of the school year, like, mid-fall trimester or something.  But it snows (which it doesn't..do...before Christmas ...), there's a dance, then it's sunny and 60 AFTER the snow time, but all of this seems to only encompass two months.  Then it's rain, damp, rain, damp, cloudy, occasional sun.  I can't follow her timeline!  I guess it's harder because I *live* here and know what kind of weather it is, but I just can't follow the logic of a sunny day one month after snow, probably before Christmas, but then the rain comes back.  We're in a weird..warp hole of ..weather or something.  

At another point, the main character, Bella, is talking to her father and he brings forth regarding her beat up old gas-guzzlin' truck from..somewhere in the 1960's..that gets lousy gas.  And she states ""I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia -- and Tacoma if I have to.""  ....  OK, I can buy stopping in Monte if you've got horrid gas mileage.  It's about 1 1/2 drive on windy two lane road.  But...between Monte and Olympia?  It's 30 minutes, on paved 4 lane highway, no stop lights, 60mph the whole way.  And it's about an hour between Olympia and Tacoma...     But what I also don't get is...why not just take the Tacoma Narrows Bridge and highway 16?  ....do they not cross bodies of water in Arizona?  It's not the main character suggesting it that gets to me, it's that all the locals, who usually KNOW this stuff, seem to pass her logic as ""Oh, ok that makes sense"" instead of a more accurate reaction like ""Um...wow, taking the long route?""

I'll let it slide.  I find it funny.  And I know the author had never been to Forks when she wrote this.

But the part that made me go ""...wait, WHAT?"" aloud when I was reading it last night...was the part about the Bears.

So apparently, these vamps go hunting animals instead of humans.  Aaand Edward (protagonist in the story) and Emmett (his 'brother') go hunting, they pass it off as camping at Goat Rocks near Mt. Rainier.  Well...when Bella asks her father if people go to Goat Rocks to camp often, he looks surprised (which..is accurate..since most of it is closed from public as it's partially on the Yakima Indian Rez, with the exception of the Pacific Crest Trail) and said something along the lines of nobody camping there because there are too many bears.


Bears.  Yes, we have bears in WA, but I don't believe I've ever been anywhere in WA where there were TOO MANY.  And the bears we do have, are the tiny little black and brown bears that generally keep as far away from people as possible.

And...then I find out later...that Emmett prefers Grizzlies.

...........

I laughed.  A lot.  Especially since there are no grizzlies in WA.  Um, unless you count the zoos.  And of course Edward goes on about how they don't hunt the Mountain Lions and Grizzlies passed the point of harming the environment so they only hunt in areas where the predators are ABUNDANT.  ....Um, yeah, they aren't.  To the point where half of the elk herds are starving to death because there are no natural predators killing them off.  They're running OUT of food because there are TOO MANY of them.  

I'm finding this more to be a comedy.  And somehow...I don't think it was meant to be XD

What I *do* know, is that it's set in Forks, WA.  A bit in La Push, here and there in Port Angeles.  Up yonder in the area my husband was raised (and he used to play against Forks High School in football, in much..much rain)

Now, I lived for a year with my parents up in the Gorge, and I saw this view (below) DAILY driving home.

<A HREF=http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=44287812>View Here</a>

So it's mostly filmed in Portland, the Gorge, ....a LOT in the gorge from those scenes, as any water scenes seem to be right on the river.

""Oh gosh! Beacon rock has moved to Forks! ....Waaaiiitasecond...how do you move a monolith...""

I don't have to hear contradicting back to back political commercials running over and over on the tv.  I don't care who they're for, they're all annoying!

No more hiding from door-to-door political peeps, trying to tell me how to vote.

No more political emails, though some are funny, I've gotten way too many as of late.

No more people calling to tell me I should vote for somebody, without breathing to let me interject and tell them stop calling me. My number is UNLISTED for a reason.  BAH.

No more mags from Bry's work telling us who they support and thus who we should vote for.

And yeah, since we can't afford a barber (and I mean in the way of paying extra to deal with a squirming whining moany groany child), I had to do it myself.

So I pull out the electric razor, do a good job so far, but I have just a bit of long hair above his ears in the sideburns area, and a bit at the base of his neck I can't get to with the good ol' remington.

And I have to pull out scissors.  And he squirms, and he wails, and he just doesn't stop moving, hands in the way, screaming like nothing else.

So I have to put the scissors AWAY less I cut him.

And out comes the remington again, only with the shortest attachment.

Suffice to say, I got the spots I needed to get but because he wouldn't hold still, he has a little odd bald spot on the side of his head, and one large one on the back.

From the front, it looks good! The back, sans the bald spot, looks a little chunky, but it doesn't look horrid.

I took pictures.  I will have to upload them to show you the humorous bald spot.

Being pregnant, and having rather strange cravings is normal--especially if you just HEAR mention of such product, and suddenly ... you *want* , you *need* it, and you *MUST HAVE* it.

SO yeah, I begged and pleaded with mine husband, and told him, ""I am going to get a bag of fritos from the store--BUT, you cannot touch them! They are for my cravings!""

See, Bry is a huge fan of fritos, and if I left a bag open somewhere, he'd snatch onto them and devour them within fifteen minutes of Diablo 2 playing.

So I made a bargain, I would buy him a bag for himself, and a bag for me.  And if he finished alll of his and mine were still there, too bad! They're *mine*.

Trojan'd.

So my poor pathetic computer (luckily backed up) is down in Vancouver in the shop for a few days getting de-virused, and possibly reformatted.

Irritating? Yeah.  

I have seven drawings inked that I needs ta color but my hubby's puter does not have any art programs what so ever.

Rawr.

The good news is that they'll be installing the two ram sticks and video card (thanks again Jenn, for those!) so my puter should run a bit more smoothly.  (Its sad cuz I actually am in hopes that they'll reformat it so I'll be able to start from scratch.  It's been a bit boggy for a while)

Mmm..

Right, in other news morning sickness sucks.  But ritz crackers help muchas.

Warren can swim now! (with arm floaties that is)

Low pH in a pool is evil on sensitive skin (and even on regular skin such as hubby's)...also evil on hair.

I'm going to be cleaning house like a mad woman while the puter is in the shop.  And yes, I tried to de-virus it myself before giving up.  McAfee, Norton, Avast, Spybot and Ad-Aware all couldn't get rid of it even when scanning in safe mode.  Avast *pinpointed* the virus, but it wouldn't let me delete it. Go fig.  Plus it kept giving me an annoying background that kept making me go to a website any time I clicked on my desktop...it locked up my task manager, and to top it off, it kept putting up annoying little bubbles in the bottom right corner saying something along the lines of ""Ohnoes! YouarenotprotectedfromSPYWARE!  Your puter is under attack!  Click here to download antivirus software! You must perform a FULL SCAN!"" ...only a little more articulately.

Warren loves cars.  All kinds of cars.  And Puppies. (Buppy)  And he can sing, dance, and climb but still can't jump, at least not yet.

Working on a comic right now, it's a slow process since I'm still trying to practice a bit with my new tablet (did I mention Jenn bought me a tablet?  O_O)  .... um, my pea pods are growing nicely....

I dunno if I want to keep up my doodle journal, cuz I've been really...putting effort into the comic instead of with other arts...even doodles suffer. ;)

........I need to clean out the stove pans again, I hate it when you're cooking something and they emit a burning smell.  They're doing that right now.

Oh, right. Also had a dream last night that I was Ursula's daughter. (from the Little Mermaid).  I think we've been watching too many Disney movies here."

"event","I suddenly understand why mom had no qualms about waking me up at buttcrack early times after I spent the previous night staying up late with friends.

At 3 something this morning Warren decided to wake up and loudly bang on his toys.  Kept me up for a few hours more than I wanted to be up, and woke Bryan up only a mere hour before he had to be at work.

No amount of coaxing by the two of us could get him back to sleep, so we turned our fan on high to drown out the noise and pass out.

It's 8 now, Warren's still asleep. 

I'm going to wake him up. 

I should feel evil/guilty, but my lovely bags under my eyes beg to differ.

"event","So...I didn't really get my huge to-do list done this weekend.

...Ah..Hmmm.  what....*thinks* ...I got the bushes trimmed. *nods*

.....

Crap, laundry counts, even though I hadn't put that on the list...right?

Right, so my brain is very scattered at the moment.  I've been in another drawing lull, too.  Crazy headed me.  It's one of those, I go one month drawing fantastical things, the next month all are BLAH.

Note to self: Stop being a perfectionist.

On a side note, I heard my favorite song today.  Those who know me in person often come to the realization that I like to say cheesecake at random intervals, much like how my brother-in-law randomly spouts Bob Dole or Lopital.

Well, while doing dishes my hubby was watching the Muppet Show with Warren, and Dr. Teeth came on singing this: <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vIxdHDT8tc>Gobble, gobble, cheesecake!</a>

I ran from the kitchen, called Kame on skype, and proceeded to dance to my new theme song.

We also watched the episode with Bernadette Peters the other day.  And ever since I've had this song stuck in my head--they also sang it at Jim Henson's funeral. <A HREF=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IHk44tdaQ>Just one person</a>"

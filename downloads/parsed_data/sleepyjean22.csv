<lj-cut text=""Impression"">Under
the impression of stilted relations,
love and denial and the wooden clap of a paint mixer
sledging the color that burns on inside of your eyelids
in that last moment of passion, 
wrecked with despair and screaming through your grocery list.
Until, strewn in base listless lustlessness, veins pump sluggish ache
on either end of damp sheets and blinking windows,
and polluted prayers break through the sound barrier.
Please, God, not again.</lj-cut>

<b>Suggestions welcome.</b> I orginally had a different idea for the last line involving domesticity, but it didn't pan out. I think as is it's a little anticlimatic, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not for this particular poem.

I ditched helping tech for Country Club because I thought he'd come home today, and now I can't help them tech. I was a little reluctant anyway, and I was only asked yesterday, so I don't feel too horrible about it, but I really hope they find enough help and I feel bad for promising and ducking out on that. Oh well.

Deep breaths. I have 16 days before college, 16 days left with Chester, I am freaking out more than just a little. =[ I want reassurance that everything's gonna be alright, I want Chester with me. I don't want to have to start over. Yuck.

Good news is I got my first postcard from Chester today, it's gorgeous and half in German and I've already read it at least five times. A little sick of waiting though. It's not his fault entirely. I would have liked to have known so I didn't have to wait for him, but I wanted to be home when he came home, that's not obsessive, is it? 

Anyway, knowing a more exact when is a relief at least."

2. I will respond by asking you five questions. I get to pick the questions.
3. You will update your LJ with the answers to the questions.
4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the post.
5. When others asking to be interviewed comment, you will ask them 5 questions.</i>

<lj-cut text=""my answers""><i>1. If you could have a pool full of jello and someone to swim in it with, what flavor would it be and who would be swimming with you?</i> Well, jello doesn't really light my candle, so I'd say Chester just because it'd be fun and I've always been partial to raspberry.
<i>2. Inspired by your icon: Which Disney princess was the luckiest in her fate?</i> Little Mermaid, freedom from her family, her fabulous boy-toy and to eat her people and friends for the rest of her life.
<i>3. You have 10 dollars worth of euro's, an ipod of your favorite music, the same magical water bottle Mika got, and a map. I drop you in Berlin. What's the first thing you do?</i> Sell everything and bum around until I've gotten a job teaching in some provincial dorf and save up enough to send for Chester. That didn't make any sense, but it would still be killer fun.
<i>4. Marry, fuck, or kill: Johnny Depp, Jude Law, Jake Gyllenhaal</i>... I don't understand this exactly, but I'll say: Kill Jake Gyllenhaal (he reminds me of James Murray! GUH-ROOSS!), Fuck Johnny Depp and Marry Jude Law, because he could totally be a lifelong fuck. So hot.
<i>5. You have to have a song stuck in your head for the rest of your life, what is it?</i> Geez, I guess ""Notorious"" by Duran Duran because it's practically stuck in my head all the time anyway.</lj-cut>"

And I want him right now. He's coming home in 3 days, and I'm sick of waiting, and at the same time I know that in college I'm going to have to go for a month or more without seeing him, (I mean, at least I'm going to be able to talk to him) but I don't want to even think about that.

-Transfer to the Red Line
-Take the Red Line to Gallery Place/Chinatown
-Transfer to the Green Line
-Get off at Mt. Vernon Square/7th Street
-Walk south on 7th Street until you see the Warehouse Theater. )

Speaking of which, anyone want to come to <u>The Country Club</u> with me? I was thinking of going Friday night. Chester may or may not come, depending on whether or not he's doing something/has something he'd rather suffer through (no offense, he's just not what I'd call a theatre buff.)

1. a much less junked up computer/system
2. a way to transfer my music to Chester, who has the insane idea that he should just bring his weird transfer-y thing into my house and gather all my music that way. I don't understand computers well enough to consider it a real option, especially since when he first proposed it I thought he meant he was going to lug his whole computer over and set it up in order to get some music files and laughed my arse off at him.

It said it was mailed from Ontario, CA, and it took me a few minutes to sort things out being as I, A. Don't know anyone who lives in California, and B. Thinking it kinda weird that there was an Ontario in California too.

and C., What the fuck is Chester doing mailing me something from Ontario? He's not in Canada!

made plans to help lindsay babysit for her little cousin-ish beings saturday night and possibly ramble about with tina saturday-day.
was going to do something with jen sunday, not sure if that is off,

going shopping for collegethings today with mother. wish me luck, the conversation went something like this:

mom: I'm getting a new food proccessor today, you're coming with to get some college things. what do you need?
me: ...?
mom: like, clothes? anything you can think of that you need?
me: socks.
mom: yes, well. ok.

I get the feeling that it will be a remarkably short trip. Still need to call back room/suitemates and find out who's bringing what, in the phone/microwave/fridge area. There are 7 of them. Fun."

Megan sent me a message in which every sentence ended with an exclamation point and I sent this back, perhaps a little over-the-top, I know, but honestly, it was a crime against humanity:

"event","Graduation Rehearsal today. People are <i>so stupid</i>. Talked for like the first time ever to Jeremy, you know, in German class, who turns out to be very nice and rather shy. He and I are next to each other, as is Dana, which I think kinda speaks about how small our class is.

Gilmore
Grabenstetter
Green

that's a lot of gaps. We don't even fill up the seats in the center, and we're having it in our gym. Whoopee. I'm really not overconcerned about graduation, to tell the truth. It'll be tiny and I think I'll probably cry, already every time I look at Andreas and Leatherwood I start getting misty, because people like Laura and Jen I know I'll keep in contact with, stay friends with, but I don't know what's going to happen with Leatherwood and Andreas, becasue I love them a lot, but we really don't talk outside of classes and seeing each other, which wouldn't happen in college and never really happens during the summer. *deep breath* It's making me cry. EEeeesh.

Spent all the rest of the day with ChesChes. *smile* we're just so... augh, we're so close. We joke a lot, but we can also talk about serious things and he's really sexy when he's not trying to be. When he's trying (which is never) he is indeed laughable. =P but I love him. Saw pictures of him as a little kid today, along with pictures of his dad. He really does look like him. I feel bad that I never got to meet him. *sigh* I love how Chester takes care of me, especially if he thinks I'm upset. College is going to be honest-to-goodness hard, I miss him when I haven't seen him for a day. Ridiculous.

Oh I forgot the part where I nearly didn't graduate. WHEE! Mr. Matey charged me for 2 math books and wouldn't back down, although WHY he'd assign me 2 of the exact same book I don't know and he didn't and it was awful and I cried at him and merideth lent me the $45, which means I now owe her $70, because she covered for me for Cappies Gala which my mom said she'd pay for and didn't and now claims she never promised to pay for. UGH. I feel bad for borrowing so much from Merideth, she's not made of money and why on earth they'd do this I don't know. In any case, it sucked royal ass. And I got yelled at for it at home, because I really don't want them at my graduation anyway and am going out to dinner afterwards with Chester and possibly Jen, but I don't know because she's got a graduation and whatever.

Graduation sucks. I don't care anymore. All I'm worried about at this point is getting through with it, walking across to get that damn piece of paper and making it to the other side. If my family tries to touch me after the ceremony, god help me, I will just walk away, and thats if they're polite. I just want to scream at them. The worst part is that they don't know what they're doing wrong. It's disgusting. I'm sick of it. Done. Done. I remember why I was spending all of my time afterschool until they were asleep out of the house with Chester. I want it back that way. All the time. Gawd. I wish I wish I wish I want I want I want I hate being so dependent on my poor friends. I'm sorry guys, you put up with a lot of shit from me. I love y'all.

Our German film is bitchin, really funny, although I don't think most of that was conveyed... lol, oh well. I jump Leatherwood like 4 times, and the pool scene, and ""Das Boom"" and altogether rather hilarious and fun to make. We finished editing it at 1 am this morning. Egis. And had some bloopers... 

my favorite of which was me filming, with bop-it noises in the backround, panning past portia picking her nose and zora messing with a sword to andreas sitting on the couch, down to his lap where he's messing with the bop-it, and then shaking the camera NO, no no no. Funny. And of course portia and me dancing. Fun stuff. I'm showing it to theatre tomorrow, with any luck.

Tomorrow is Biology project time, which I'm now doing with Andreas. Hm. We don't know what yet... eeeek...

That means not seeing Chester for 2 days straight, longest time EVER yet, well, minus the beginning when I was all like CAAAATONAHOOOOTINROOOOF, and I'm feelin' it. But after that school is over.

Already if we get it immediately there's precious little time to get any of it signed. Goddamn you, Wonka. How many times have we told you? <b>KEEP IT IN THE PANTS!</b>

I'm upset because I wanted so badly to sever all ties to my family through college and now they'll have the connection and andrew upset me even more by making me think about how hard it's going to be to maintain our relationship <i>at all</i> and which IS more important to me now? jesus freakin christ. ='[ revenge or love? closure or a new beginning?

I'm so sick with anxiety. I don't want to get out of bed again for a week. I'm not going to bio. <strike>Maybe not Choir. And we're not doing anything in Math... and then there's just German, which I don't really want to go to...</strike> gaaaah... No, just not Bio."

His coming out was analogous to the death of a fat man. Shooting pains, followed by seizing, clawing girth and the suffocation insulated in his own crippling revulsion. Offensive and lethargic, the initial momentum from chair to knee to sprawled on the panting floor instilled with a halting ignominy. But the eventual stillness was worse, so much worse than the grunting exertion that had preceded it, his weighty problem revealed and stark and no movement left.

He told Carlos first, chest expanding in anticipation. Both hands hovered uncomfortably-- four and a half inches from his midsection. Carlos did not stop chain smoking. Under his murky eyes, the realization crystallizing in him throughout his adulthood was blown casually awry with his cheap cigarette smoke.</lj-cut>"

"event","Totally wasn't going to do this meme until I realized the alternative was to start working/take a shower. Mf;lajdfk. But it's all body parts/weird, I will attempt to be amusing anyway *monkey dance* (funny how that didn't stop being funny in 7th grade, isn't it?)

<lj-cut text=""slow death immersed in laura organs?"">Dear Brain: Most of the time, you and I get along, I like being smarty, except moodswings and the headaches are gonna stop now kthnx.

Dear Epidermis: I got you from my Daddy's pale german side, and I like that you're translucent in winter and barely tanned in summer. I can see all my veins! Oh boy! Oh yeah and you're soft. ;] I do not like the way his looks now, however, so try not to get skin cancer and die mmk?

Dear Eyes: You are all big and blue/green/withyellowringaroundthemiddle and we get along quite nicely. Remind me to get you a fruit basket for being SuperLiscious, and then yank it away cruelly for not being able to see 5 feet in front of yourself. Then maybe throw some bananas back at you for being A.OK with contacts. &hearts;

Dear Eyebrows: F for Attendance. Work on that. A for your nonexistant shape being very light and pretty.

Dear Nose: You are Nascar Nose, enormous and german jewish and squatting in the middle of my face. And ALWAYS stuffed! What's with that? It's SUMMER! Get over yourself, and pull one for the <i>team</i>, ok buddy?

Dear Ears: Eh, I don't notice you that much. But that's good, because my brother has really funny ENORMOUS ears and my sister has freak ears so I guess I'm the lucky one. Good going for being normal.

Dear Hair: I'm getting you cut. Maybe with layers? I really don't know. Because you confuse me. We need to communicate better, cause right now it's like ""huh? you wanted... oh, right, I left it at the cleaners."" But when you're not frizzy and whorish looking, you've got pretty curls and are soft and fine, if a rather normal shade of brown. I'd never dye you tho.

Dear Lips: I like you. &hearts;

Dear Teeth: Unhappy. You're too big and not straight and kinda yellowish and really very unhappy, to be honest.

Dear Tongue: Um. I'll try not to keep biting you sorry?

Dear Neck: I think you're thin and pretty. Stay that way. OOOh and really sensitive yeah that's nice. &hearts;

Dear Shoulders: Eh, you're too big, but I guess that's my rack's fault.

Dear Upper Arms: Hahah I LOVE showing off me mini-muscles here, I will take a picture and display them EVERYWHERE because they're so squashsome. Really only so defined because you babies are fat free, but damn does it look cool. &hearts; &hearts;

Dear Elbows: Eh. You have this weird-bumpy-mole-thing on your right elbow, which got there because I picked a scab, so it's my fault, but otherwise you're ok. You've taken a lot of abuse over the years, thanks for hanging through my Tom-boy phase.

Dear Lower Arms and Wrists: You're tiny. Try not and break, k? Otherwise, tho, I like being able to touch my thumb and ring finger round ya.

Dear Hands: Ick. You're kinda aight, but left hand, work on that middle finger, it's still got a lump of shattered bone from when I broke you. You look pregnant, already. Clean up the act. And being able to grow fingernails would be nice.

Dear Collarbones: I haven't thought about you since I broke you when I was 7 or so. Still together? Good.

Dear Shoulderblades: Who?

Dear Rack: ... Lose some weight. You look ridiculous and out of place on someone who's 5'2"", and as I found out last night, I cannot wear tight clothes/cute clothes that are slightly low or ANYTHING without looking like a whore! I'd like to change that! Been appreciating the roundy-ness lately tho, that's kinda cool. Seriously tho, get off the couch. I never asked for this.

Dear Squeedilyspooch: Don't die. If you are what I think you are I can't live without you.

Dear Belly: Pudge sucks. But I can't really complain about it too much yet, just tone yourself a little, ok? I'll be on the couch.

Dear Hips: WHERE ARE YOU? I'M READY! I like the little bones that stick out, not so much cool with the fact that YOU DON'T EXIST. You make me funny-shaped. *tear*

Dear Arse: GHETTO BOOTY AWARD HOLLA! *standing ovation* Funny how little I appreciated you before I really really wanted to get into the Ghetto bootys' and Dannea taught me how to shake you like a black girl. Hot. &hearts;

Dear Girly Parts: We'll talk later.

Dear Thighs: Eh. I miss it when you didn't touch. But I guess you guys aren't so bad now, only if this whole stretch mark thing keeps going on I'mma gonna take an axe to you. Oh and I like how you look when I'm sitting with my knees up.

Dear Calves: I like the line of muscleage. Could do without the soreness, but I'm guessing that's how I get the line, so I'll deal. &hearts;

Dear Ankles: You're pretty and small. I heart you. &hearts;

Dear Feet: What happened? you used to be so pretty! but I guess getting run over with a car didn't help that much (it's all flaky-scabby. not cool.) I'm disappointed, boys.

Dear Knees: I'm not 10 anymore stop being all knobby and, to quote vlad, ""german"". You still have scars from falling when I was 12! Clean up the act, man. </lj-cut>

Last night was Laura's B-day party! It was really fun, although the beginning was a little awkward/slow, and we all played random theatre games and cranium. I got her a Betta fish named Squibby. I don't care what you say, his name is Squibby.

After everyone left, it was HerMeChesterAndrewm just chillin cause meth had to go home so she could work tomorrow and we played Cranium some and Laura and I played dress up, seeing how incredibly whore-ish I looked in her clothes while she'd put on the SAME OUTFIT and look cute and presentable. Un. Fair. Fuck cleavage. and a little bit of the ass. <b>curves + midgit-tood = whoreish unnaturalness.</b>

Whitney and I were supposed to do our Silent Film today at 4, but I'm not really sure if that's happening, considering she hasn't called like she was supposed to and I got no answer when I called her and yeah. ERGHGHG! Anyway. Jen's Recital at 6:45-ish too.

IN CLOSING, I am Jill's Right Testi-- OOOh, uh, Nipple?"

"event","Senior Shows were ass-y. Ugh. I really wanted more time, But it's over and I'm Not Going To Think About it THEEND.

In happy news--

<b>I HAVE MICKEY MOUSE AND SNOOPY UNDERWEAR!</b> (and bday presents for Jen and MeganD. ;] In one fell swoop. Nothing for LauraM yet, hrm. Have to work on that... hah... hah... o.O)

and,

&hearts; CHESTER &hearts;

In all seriousness, not to drag senior shows out of senior room etc, but I was honestly suprised by TJ's and Tamada's. It was like finger counting of sexual abuses. I lost score. I feel bad for not keeping up and trying harder to be TJ's friend after freshman year.

However, I got this feeling before, But now I REALLY REALLY associate Tiff with that song <i>Hang on Sloopy</i>, y'know? hah. A little terrible.

Merideth's was suprisingly funny and refreshing. People said nice-ish things about me in their good-byes. It wasn't on par with the senior shows of the past is all, and I always thought I'd be doing something totally cool for my senior show, not... well. anyway. I guess it was better that the mood was more low key. LauraM tripped on her chair. My favorite part of her show. XD I love you, Laura.

oooh the happiness of underwear. =]

OOh and I HAVE (with some deliberation) decided not to totally distance myself. Well not legally. And not be too brash. I don't know, but I hope this benevolence lasts a little longer, because the all-consuming rage and destructiveness was even getting on my nerves. I'm going to write a note explaining calmly and kindly why I want to live somewhere else until the end of summer. I'll need proof readers. ;] It'll be better tho."

Jen and I went and got faux-chinese and watched <u>Psycho</u> and guessed the whole plot 20 minutes in but it was still good and Norman Bates was really cute and had a nice butt and then AndrewM came over and RUINED LIFE, because we went over to the Rugby party that was a few houses over,

and I threw Jen in the pool, and then ANDREW POINTED ME OUT TO SOME EVIL JOCK GUY who pushed ME in the pool and then when I was getting out Jen pushed me back in, and then someone let the goddamn attack-water dog in and it scratched me up and drownded me for a good 10 minutes with everyone standing around the pool being like ho-hum and OW.

goddamn owner didn't even apologize or ask me how I was after I finally was able to fight my way out, without anyone pulling the dog off me ever (bigger than I was!) and my watch died. *tear*

me: penis

And I put peanutshells down her shirt, and I made Andrewm drive me to the choir concert which got him pissy because he got pissy because I don't really know why but I'm pretty sure it was my fault and I'm sorry!

We voted for Superlatives, and they were funny, and I wanna get Best Dramatic Actress which my table nominated me for and might if the stupid ho freshman don't vote for bitch morgan en masse. Poo.

On the plus side, thanks to 2 incidents with my right foot and falling down the stairs on cappies night, I'm pretty sure Most Accident Prone Actress is in the bag. ;]

Almost finished a crossword. I love the move <u>Life is Beautiful</u> and the plot hole in <u>Au Revoir Les Enfants</u> bothers me, where in a French, mind you, <i>FRENCH</i> boys boarding school they do not notice that one of the boys is jewish... and therefore would be CIRCUMSIZED. Ridiculous. I'd notice. ;]

Also, Chester. &hearts;

<b>Accepted to VCU Honors Program.</b>

Even more so, Chester's hammock. &hearts;

Oh, and how do you like the sound of Emily Laura <strike>Macklin</strike> *cough* 

Right now these are the ones I like: <b>Tulpe. Weide. Linnet. Blende. Ohnwurzeln</b> (which mean Tulip, Willow, Linnet, Iris and without roots.)"

"event","my last IB today, German, EVERYONE finished after the first 30 minutes of each test (even though it was 2 tests of 1:30 and we weren't allowed to leave until the first hour was up) and on the first test we had a prompt that was an interveiw with Clausi, der Weinachstmann. (Santa Claus, the Christmasman. o.O)

Then we had about 40 minutes between the end of that and the beginning of the next test... so Zora, Dray and I jetted to Wendys (mmm chicken!) and got back 5 minutes late for the test, and one of the prompts was like ""you hear a noise in the kitchen while babysitting, write a story.""

<i>So I was babysitting little Adolph and Benito, and we were playing monopoly. Benito wanted everyone to have the same amount of money, and I tried to explain that that wasn't the way the game worked, but he threw a fit and had his way. Adolph was being difficult too, and only wanted to play Risk. So I went to find Risk, and when I came back with it the boys were gone. I heard a strange screaming in the kitchen, and rushed to find out what it was. When I entered I threw my hands in the air and screamed too. Adolph was standing there with a large knife, covered in blood! And said ""Froehige Halloween!""</i>

Then I hung out and played tekken/crosswords with Andreas and Andrewm, which was bitchin. We went to see <u>Unleashed</u>, which was Jet Li... acting? it was... interesting. I liked it, but I'm not sure if the genre hybrid worked that well, kinda ended up being simplistic on all levels, although a little wrenching. Eh. Morgan Freeman is beast.

I'm excited. So excited. I'm going to go through all my clothes, pack properly, leave a note to take me off their taxes as a dependent and leave my parents house. I'm going to stay with Andreas till graduation and possibly till I turn 18 and can change my name. For the first time, on the fence about whether or not I should change my first name. =/ I'll decide later. I have at least that much time. I'll file for no longer being dependent on my parents. I'm so glad. So, just, relieved, and to leave my parents house as well? It's truly a blessing. I'm really thankful to Andrew, and he was so willing with his house. I mean, my mom will still know where I am, she's in contact with his mom, and she'll probably even see me, and try to talk me out of it, and spin it however she wishes. But I'll be free. Especially later when I move to Jen's house, and she and my dad won't be welcome there.

We only had to drop 2 people from our one-act, so Dannea and I decided that we'd just fill the roles. It's kinda cool, I get to be the uber bitchy gang leader. Total stretch, considering I run my one-act like a nazi anyway. ;] But it'll be fun."

"event","I should be writing my grant for Fiskars. But I decided to pop onto LJ before my team leader showed up for a visit &quot;to help&quot; me and my boss through the AmeriCorps process. I don't know how she will be helpful unless she knows most of the food industry business in Spokane and is willing to hook me up.

But Fiskars got me inspired. The grant says to creatively answer one of the application questions in an &quot;outside of the box manner.&quot; My first thought: stop motion film too?! So I've decided, if I get my boss on board, that I'm going to try and make a stop motion film for this grant that's due by February 2010.

Anyone have advice or opinions on the best programs to use? I was thinking Virtual Dub.

Blah, I wish I had winter break like every other student."

(I participated in church that week, the sermon was a bit black and white. I opted to not &quot;pray for our lost friends&quot; who engage in such activities. Eh.)

"event","The future in-laws came over this week to see the new apartment. Clearly I was nervous, I almost ruined the lovely food I prepared while managing to burn myself on the oven.

It takes knowing my future father in-law to appreciate the banal habits he has, because the first thing he did upon entering was inspect our belonging to make sure Sam didn't nab any of HIS belongings. So, he commandeered three movies and complained, but left behind, two books.

I'm waiting for the fall out though.

The future in-laws are youth pastors for a local church. Their kids could not watch/listen/participate in secular things. They become uncomfortable and combative when I make feminist comments about the Bible.

Situated next to the kitchen table is my ten year collection of Pagan and New Age books. Much to my unease I saw their eyes dart shockedly to the book titles and then politely again to their meal. I am wondering when I will hear about this, and if I will have to hear about it from Sam's older brother, who is thankfully a black sheep of the family in some ways, and therefore open minded.

Hi. I'm you're future daughter in-law and I consider myself Pagan. I could go into the details of whether I'm a Reconstuctionist truly or not, but I have a feeling you can't get past the P-word. I promise I'm not scary though. I hope you like my celebration of the true roots of most holidays.

I suppose while I wait I should come up with some good talking points. I have a feeling my future father in-law and I will butt heads soon..."

"event","So I'm working for a new nonprofit now.<br /><br />This new nonprofit has four well established programs that service low-income women and their children, as well as homeless women. My job is working on a fifth program that is barely a year old; it's a job training program that is a lot like FareStart: <a href=""http://www.farestart.org/"">www.farestart.org/</a>. My program is really small in a lot of ways. I share an office with four other people that is really meant for one person (or two?), and the program itself is a rolling application style that closes when we have eight trainees.<br /><br />I love my job, which is great. When I left my old job at a nonprofit law firm I thought, &quot;I will never find a job that fulfills me that way this one does, nor will I work with people enthusiastic about their work and coworkers.&quot; I guess I should have rethought that since my office is located within a day drop in center for homeless women (well, women in general really). At first it was hard to deal with an all female office, the constant rambles so as to avoid hurting people's feelings, the sheer force of estrogen. I have to say though, everyone here truly <u>cares</u> about everyone else's feelings. It's kind of nice, especially if you're having a crummy day at work.<br /><br />What really jazzes me about my new job is the subject, which is two fold: nourishment and nonprofit management. By nourishment I mean every connotation of the word. The program seeks to help women who have recovered from physical abuse, substance abuse, sudden financial changes, or young women trying to make a new life after bad decisions. We want to nourish seeking the new page in their life, all the things previously underdeveloped in their life. Nourishment for our customers- we have a cafe and a bakery that make AMAZING baked goods and does catering around town. Nourishment never felt so good right, when you get something freshly baked but also help women overcome barriers to employment.<br /><br />Secondly, it's nice to know that the &quot;odd&quot; skills I acquired in college have purpose. I had a few professors who believed in my passions and supported me through the grueling core of undergrad's rote process. The skills and habits I learned from my old boss are in valuable in this new nonprofit, she's my <strong>hero</strong>. Some of the other AC women working here with me want to be doing direct service with the homeless/low-income population, but I'm right at home in front of my computer drafting documents for grant use or marketing pieces. I'm starting to understand where I need to go next with my life.<br /><br />The bonus to my job: our Chef Instructor for the program often brings me things from the kitchen. Today I got a grocery bag full of freshly baked whole wheat rolls and fresh garden grown grapes. I look forward to the days when the trainees make sweets, our truffles and signature cookies are to die for. I also enjoy the food/agriculture/sustainable eating aspect of my job because it's a subject I'm deeply interested in, and have been thinking more and more about going on to higher education for. My only complication is I'm unsure of the programs, and their appeal, at the schools Sam has applied to. I suppose we could live apart for a couple of years? I hear that UVA has good grad programs though...<br /><br />The one darker side to work is the dark side to the population. For example, yesterday I asked one of the women who comes to the drop in center if she could help me as I prepped for a fundraiser this week. Simple task, and she did fine with it, but she has a family history of mental illness. She often talks aloud, or mumbles to herself, about how bad she is or how she would like to just die. On days were she is less moody this isn't as much a problem. How do you deal with that?! I'm not specifically trained in dealing with chemical dependency or mental illness. While I have personal experience in those areas, it's not enough for me to NOT feel uncomfortable listening to people mumble about death or hearing voices. Actually, it's crushing to see these brave women live on the streets and deal with things like schizophrenia or physical disabilities like diabetes. Maybe this is why I still hide in my office more than the other AC women- they are more gutsy getting to know the women of the drop in center. I picked up crocheting so I could hang out front with the women more to get to know them.<br /><br />It'll be interesting to see how the rest of my time at this job goes. I have high hopes!<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","I am a grant writing, email sending, Vista position searching, contingency plan making machine. I have three EOI email drafts waiting to be sent promptly tomorrow morning for various positions, most of which right now (the night is young!) are in Michigan.<br /><br />I got word today from the FFN position that they are waiting until June 2 to announce their choice. I am not at all surprised and had no intention of contacting Erin regarding the choice until that week anyway, but I am apprehensive that such a &quot;hard to make&quot; decision is showing my dark thoughts to be correct: I was up against some very tough competition for this position. My guess is that one of the candidates is an education major or something. Let's face it, a business major may not really hold a flame to that.<br /><br />OMEN is taking their sweet time to notify people. Impatient as always, I emailed the team leader faux asking if the application was really sent, citing their website's lack of the position posting as well. I think I could really like the OMEN job, and Monmouth is a college town so I know finding roommates could be easy. Plus, Sam is looking at Oregon for med school- more on this later.<br /><br />My Mom leaves June 19th for Alaska for the summer. I am happy for her in a bittersweet manner, but also irritated and feel cheated. I wanted to spend time mainly with her, and now she is leaving. No one is sure right now if the move is permanent or not (she claims it is not), but she gave her two weeks notice today. Going back to the motherland to help my grandma who's health has dramatically worsened in the last four to six months. Grandma, Mom, and my sister want me to fly up for a vacation but I can't commit to something like that until I have a job- or some freakin' money! Plane tickets aren't cheap, and moving is outrageously expensive. I am about ready to throw most of my belongings to the donation pile! It would be really fun to visit Baton Rouge and also Alaska- but I know something like that is unlikely.<br /><br />Sam got his MCAT score back yesterday. On Monday I stressed about if he didn't get a good score how I could help him cope and pick up the pieces to try again- clearly I had been mislead by his humble expectations. We checked the website at 2 pm and found that he got a <strong>38, which puts him in the 99.1 percentile!</strong> Needless to say I am very proud of him and excited. With a score like that he will surely get through round one applications easily, and I like to believe he will make it to round two easily too. I'm pretty excited about the whole thing, and if all goes well when I am done with my first year of AC I will move to the city he is in for med school and do another year. I like most all the places he is applying to, and have family either in those states or close by. Virginia sounds strangely appealing to both of us for no known reason, and Oregon Health Sciences too. What will be even more fun is having the &quot;we're moving in together&quot; talk with his parents, who seem to think that is a weird thing for people to do before marriage. The way things have been going I am not too sure it will be before marriage- no telling though, I like surprises. Only time will tell, oh, and one year of us being apart.<br /><br />I am just so ready to have a job lined up. I mean I started looking at jobs in February! By the time I move all my crap to my rents' place this weekend it will be June and I still won't have a job yet. Not going to lie, I am feeling a bit pushed, to the point that I would consider looking at jobs in Spokane just because I know I could land one pretty damn easily here.<br /><br />"

If the job I <strong>am</strong> excited to interview for is not the one you will ultimately contact but then not tell me until the interview begins- I will not be a happy camper. My interview today went ok I guess, oh, except for the part when instead of it being a job about financial stability for families it was about youth engagement.<br /><br />Now, I know we were all in high school once, but I'm not fond of the youth of this country lately. And I'm not sure I want to work with them for a year. People should not settle in life, and I don't want to settle for a job.<br /><br />Also, life needs to get going or something! I keep waiting to hear if Ash is getting into LSU, and what Sam's MCAT scores are. Naturally, everything seems to have to wait until June. Oh joy. Sam's MCAT score really does give me an indicator of what I can expect in the next year and a half or so. I might be looking at living in Nebraska or Virginia, or if we're lucky Loma Linda.<br /><br />I am so tired of this crap right now. Senioritis makes finals really tough right now too.

"event","I could do a &quot;real job&quot; (as many people like to call them) after graduation, instead of AmeriCorp. This is an option I keep on the back burner, but do not favor.

I could do AC in the Seattle area. There are plenty of positions in Seattle itself, and many of the green motivated programs are in Bellingham (not exactly Seattle, but certainly NOT Spokane). There is a volunteer management position in Everett that I am interested in because I think understanding how/why/when/etc people volunteer and get involved in issues is important. The but in that statement is that the job is in Everett. I've heard some unpleasant things about Everett lately, and I have no perspective because I live in Spokane and know hardly nothing about the other side of the state.

I could do AmeriCorp anywhere else in the country, and I do mean anywhere. I've looked at positions in places like Oklahoma and Iowa (Good gracious, talk about the middle of nowhere). I am attracted to a position in Nebraska because it partners with a service dog organization and might expand to create a penial program with dogs who don't cut the test for service animals. We all know I love dogs and miss being around them. The only draw back is a small night life/social scene. Maybe I could start some kickass hobbies like knitting and sewing? Right now I am really drawn to a farmers market initiative in Rochester, NY. I think pushing for more local food sources is becoming more important, plus I appreciate quality produce that national chains can never capture. And since it's Rochester, the night life and social scene would be bountiful.

This is the problem! So many choices, I'm suffering from 31 syndrome. I don't know what to chose and think I could be happy at just about any of the locations.

I'm not sure I feel like Seattle is the city for me, I don't find myself drawn to the lights of the city across the mountains, and I wonder what is turning me off from returning. Any shameless campaigns in Seattle's favor could be helpful. Nothing better than to have someone who knows the area tell me why it's worth giving a second look to.

On top of this I often fight the grinding and flat incomprehension of people who think I am crazy for doing AmeriCorp. I could get a job with a top Northwest company like Boeing or Amazon, or possibly land (maybe this is a bit ambitious) job with a consulting firm as a bottom rung intern. But honestly, I like working for a nonprofit. I love going to work each week, I adore my boss and what our team brings to the local area, and how I feel impassioned by the work we advocate. If I didn't want to get out of Spokane I might even try to get a permanent position where I work. I spend my time reading social entrepreneurship books, and reading about people who are trying to change the cultural norms. People who believe there are universal basic human rights to not be impoverished, to have adequate health care, to lead a fulfilling life, etc and work for years exhaustively doing everything possible to create such realities. Who wants to work behind a desk? I'd rather work for small pay and enjoy my work- get out in the field.... Ideally I would like to one day work for Ashoka. Doing AmeriCorp exposes me to more NP/SE organizations and knowledge.

Now if only I could pick 10 positions to apply for and be committed to each one and its location!"

Who couldn't agree about shitty roommates, I certainly have laughed a lot about the antics Ash's roommates create. I just thought it could be funny to share, plus some day I will look back and say, &quot;Oh! This is why I can't live with other people anymore. I forgot until...&quot;

This process has caused me to take photos of my room. I would like to not live in one room alone, and I feel this is the same room restated/reinvented from previous years, but most of the items are nostalgic inducing items I cannot part with, and so they go back up periodically.

"event","So, apparently I've reached the age when I can't stay up late and get up early. Three weeks ago I was sick for two weeks, then I got better thanks to a Z-pack. And for the past two weeks I've been getting day-long headaches. About three days out of five I get a headache that leaves me looking like a perpetual grimace at work and walking to class. But these headaches are weird because no IBP or Tylenol will help make them go away. They feel like what my head does when I'm sick with a fever and stand up to fast: the brain rattling cerebral pain. My thought? This is my body telling me I can't run on five hours of sleep and no food in the house. Nothing compounds my headaches worse than nothing to make in the fridge.<br /><br />Part of the culprit is my class schedule this year. I have at least three classes where I have to go for participation reasons, but have to teach myself from the book. Blasted teachers. So, when factoring in that &quot;school&quot; expects me to spend 1.5-2 hours of homework for every class hour, find time to eat, work, and sleep- I'm looking at a day that is more than 24 hours long. Ahem. I really have to start cutting corners for classes so I can get sleep. It really hampers me when I can't think because my head is pounding, besides it disturbes me that they last all day. On the good side Dr. Maccarone is helping me research Business Ethics MBAs and will write me a charming letter of recommendation. And I'm starting to be able to control the blush I get every time I talk to Dr. Steverson- seriously, why does the man make me blush all the time? It's awkward.<br /><br /><u>To Do:</u><br /><strike>Solicit Grandma for tuition money</strike><br /><strike>Pay cell phone bill (late)</strike><br />Pay dentist office (late?)<br />Buy groceries<br />Clean room<br />Do laundry<br /><strike>Get money from roomies for Util bill</strike><br />Sign up to be a blind fair housing tester<br />Get sleep<br />Watch Dexter with Sam<br />Buy snow tires<br />Figure out if Sam is coming for Tday<br /><br />"

"event","Being broke is always fun come the time when groceries run short, but I try my best to get inventive. I was talking with someone at school the other day about how there is a perceived notion that poor people eat bad food. And part of this statement is true- case in point all the crap you can buy at Wal-Mart like Doritos, or McD's $1 menu. My housemate, ""Tabitha,"" was disgustedly telling me just last night how she saw a 10 year old girl at Wal-Mart who was so overweight she had a belly hanging over her pants (I can't help but shudder).

Well, my Mom always raised us with healthy food, even if it cost more. She's kind of a hippy nut so she buys organic a lot because she believes in its ethical and health properties. Leaving home and eating ""cafeteria"" food was a rude awakening for me, and after Freshman year I didn't do it anymore. The problem though over the past three years is making healthy, <b>affordable</b>, and tasty food. When I was a kid I experimented in the kitchen all the time, weird stuff came out of my pots and pans. ""Butterscotch"" that was made only of raw eggs, vanilla extract, brown sugar, and butter... I was only 6 when I made that one up.

Nowadays, experimenting in the kitchen is a hell of a lot harder because I don't possess what I would call a well stocked kitchen- I'm sure many of my fellow chef de cuisine can sympathize. I think I have a total of 4 or 5 spices to my name. Also, organic gets expensive. Farmers Markets in Spokane only run so many months of the year still, and there is no Trader Joe's or something similar besides Huckleberry's (don't ask). 

But tonight I tried my hand at making something healthy, filling (very important), and comprised of stuff I had randomly lying around the cupboards. I thought I'd share- though I'm sure this is not a ""new"" food mix.

<u>Oatmeal Stew:</u>
2 cups uncooked oatmeal
2 cups water
4 cups broth
3 large carrots
4 potatoes
""some"" green onions
1/2 cup Almond meal, or around that amount
(optional) meat, like Polish sausage or chicken
(optional) seasoning- I used some basil and Mrs. Dash

So cook the oatmeal with the water and broth. While that is happening roughly chop the vegetables together. Once the oatmeal is cooked, but there is still liquid left, put the veggies in and turn the heat up again to around 7. Keep it at this temperature only long enough to get the the softening processed started, then turn it down to 4 or 5 so as not to burn the bottom. Cook the mixture until the carrots are pretty much soft (it took my stove 30-40 minutes), then add the Almond meal to help thicken it, and throw in the meat and seasoning. Let this cook for another 15 minutes.

I love sour cream so I garnished my stew with sour cream and salt on top. Not to bad for thinking I had ""nothing"" to cook with, plus I feel like I actually eat something healthy.

Many a road, you know

As the days keep turning into night

Well I have been quietly standing in the shade
All of my days
Watch the sky breaking on the promise that we made
All of this rain
And I've been trying to find
What's been in my mind

All of my days
I cried aloud
I shook my hands
What am I doing here
All of these days
For I look around me
And my eyes confound me
And it's just too bright
As the days keep turning into night

Now I see clearly
It's you I'm looking for

"event","Sam and I have been talking back an forth about what our ideal dog is. I like big dogs, mastiffs and other large breeds; he likes medium sized dogs, like the love of his life was his dog, Opi, who was a Cocker Spaniel. I'm not against Spaniels, I just like other dogs better. I was on <a href=""http://www.dogster.com/"">Dogster.com</a> not too long ago looking at Filas that needed adopting- there was a really pretty apricot female in Washington. Alas, I don't have a yard or a landlord who is cool with dogs. But anyway, today Sam and I were taking a break from my homework and I found the ideal dog.

It's a cross between him wanting an English Springer Spaniel- which I'm not opposed to- and me wanting an Australian Shepard. Needless to say, this dog is the best of both of those breeds. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever! They are GORGEOUS. Red haired dogs with coats like a Springer Spaniel, energy like an Australian Shepard, and good family socialization. They are medium sized and live in any climate or location, city or country. They have cute little noses that are flesh colored unlike most dogs. I really like the displayed temperament qualities the dog is said to have. The id photo here doesn't do the breed justice: <a href=""http://www.dogster.com/breeds/nova_scotia_duck_tolling_retriever"">The Troller</a>.

Oh, also, after a big blow up, my dear boyfriend has come to realize his connotation of the word feminist is no longer acceptable- crying changes a man's opinion- and has since become more understanding. A long conversation about feminism, reverse racism, some religion, and the fact saying something doesn't mean your receiver hears <i>that</i> message has created a good shift. He even admitted to the guys at work he's a feminist while arguing (one of my gripes) about Nestle and its third world ethical issues concerning baby formula, none of them cared, but I was pretty cheery about it."

"event","Hurrah! Success is mine in this mini saga of house drama.

Fourth roommate, let's call her Jem as a pun on her name, moved in two weeks ago. That Wednesday Tom Cruise returned from her long hiatus working in Wyoming. The house had been relatively clean and quiet, then <b>BAMB</b> she and her stuff exploded on the scene. The following day we had a house dinner and the inevitable ""house rules and bills"" talk. Despite having lived through my first of these talks I was still apprehensive.

Here is a little background on Jem. She is one of eight children and went to a private boarding school that culminates in the girls becoming nuns- until she transferred to GU to complete her degree. She reminds me of myself somewhat during freshman year. Very sweet girl, lovely decor taste, artistic, studious, no cell phone, religious. Oh, and did I mention she's on a budget to pay for school?

We get the rules, and Tom Cruise mentions how she knows she is most messy and we need only remind her to clean up after herself (cough, I don't see this working well, but ok!), etc. Then we go through who each bill is paid through and stuff. Comcast bill comes up and Tabitha says how much it is per month. Jem then speaks up and says she can't afford cable, nor does she watch tv!! OH gods, my heart stopped and I did a little victory dance in my head. Tabitha and Tom Cruise exchange upset glances, but say they understand as we've been through this- who me? To my annoyance Tabitha and Tom Cruise announce they will corrupt poor Jem and get her hooked on shows like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes."" Excuse me?! No, you will do no such thing to trick her into paying for cable!

As it stands, the four of us split wireless charges, and Tabitha and Tom Cruise pay for cable all by themselves. Victory is sweet. And if I want to watch Dexter or Flight of the Concords, I will head over to the bf's place. I have other good news, but it deserves its own post, which might take awhile since the semester started for me this Tuesday.

Cheers!"

"event","Well, something like two weeks went by and I didn't hear anything from my roommate who originally emailed me to say not paying cable was ""not fair."" What was weird is that the roommate who is here in our house, <u>never</u> said a word to me about the email though she got it. Let's call roommate who sent the email Tom Cruise (Plant Unicorn!), and the one who is so passive she never says anything Tabitha.

Luckily, Tom Cruise's boyfriend stops by to pick up some clothes for her before he goes to WY to see her for a weekend. Her boyfriend and I are friends and have known each other since freshman year. Thankfully he can separate friends and his engagement to Tom Cruise. We talk, and then the conversation invariably turns to the fact our house is in a spot of contention over me not paying for cable. From what he tells me she disliked my reply email very much- but never bothered to email back or call! So, deciding I must be the only adult in the house, I decide to keep communication open. Later that night I <a href=""http://www.slydial.com/"">SlyDial</a> her phone because I don't want to have an actual conversation. I figure a voice mail is damn good enough. I leave a voice mail saying I hope she knows I'm not trying to be a bitch but that money is so tight it's jeopardizing whether I graduate on time, and that some parts of my email were really snarky so she should take it with a grain of salt. I even go so far as to offer letting her pay less for this months Avista bill since she's been gone and I've been the one <b>needing</b> air conditioning upstairs to sleep.

A day later I get a very puzzling text to the effect of, ""Don't worry I understand what you mean. See you when I get home at the end of the month!"" Excuse me? If you understand then you better not give me any more guff about NOT paying for cable! Uh, but I have a sneaking suspicion that come August 29th when our 4th roommate moves in and Tom Cruise is also back that we will have a FOURTH conversation about this dilemma. Funny thing is, my response will never change. They can go suck it."

"event","What exactly qualifies as a ""hostile"" living environment? 

Option A: When one never leaves valuable belongings in accessible areas. Mistrust is rampant within the dwelling.
Option B: When the phrase <b>small claims</b> is used in reference to conflict resolution, as well as sublet.
Option c: When one wants to punch his or her roommate in the ovaries/junk in a fit of rage at the roommate's utter idiocy.
Option D: When there are passive-aggressive alienation tactics to make one person within the dwelling emotionally distressed.

So my two roommates are trying to make me pay for cable, which I never watch. Funny thing is, they  <u>never</u> consulted me before they signed a contract with Comcast. They are trying to tell me that if I won't pay cable they just won't pay the ""difference"" in our Avista bills. I wouldn't exactly mind if they had first talked to me about it, or if I could afford it, or if they paid more for their egregiously larger rooms with walk-in closets. Since we've had three confrontations on this subject now, my house has become a prison of sorts. I work 40+ hours so I'm not here much, but it seems like half the time when I am here I'm walking on egg shells. I have never been more happy that I work with attorneys and law students. What makes it all better is one is in a completely different state, and the one here is so sweet and passive on the surface she says ok then complains to the out of stater. If I really were a violent person this would be call for a punch or two.

After four years I can honestly, without doubt, say that GU is full of stupid people who think they are getting an education by picking the easiest classes and drinking away braincells. One of my roommates is a GU student, and I feel she fits the bill. Clue number one I shouldn't have moved in with her, besides the fact she didn't listen to any of my comments when we were searching places to live. I'm so glad I'm out of this f-ed up school soon. Even being broke without a job is better than being here.

France or Quebec, you look golden from where I am. This is an ongoing saga, as I am still waiting for the ""witty"" reply I am sure my out of state roommate is trying to craft in reply to my email concerning what is ""fair"" when paying bills in a house only half filled with ""adults."""

It is called HR people, (and while I have my own opinions about that department), why didn't you use it to manage the hemorrhage the rift caused?!

This is an angry love sticky note left on your desk from one of your devoted interns. Yes I am irritated, mainly because ACCT can't keep to themselves in assuming because I'm the only one left in the department, that I can do <i>everything</i>. Flattering, maybe, stressful, yes. Whatever happened to cross functionality within a corporation? We are wasting my skills by explaining things you can't seem to take time to train everyone on, yet expect me to find extra time that I don't get paid for to finish your massive work assignments. Ok, sure I'm complaining about this, but our clients and stakeholders deserve quality, not quantity, and this is not what they are getting under current organization. This is why I said while I'm on vacation I'll be working on a self directed project of a case study, including looking over financial papers, Board Member competencies, and whether anyone even knows their ""assigned"" job descriptions- or if those descriptions are even relevant.

At the very least could you exercise some of your authority and explain to our other interns that working 10 to 12 hours a week with intakes is great, but if the organization needs help, that they should necessarily understand the imperative in that statement and act upon assisting in those projects... Because I don't know if anyone else realizes this, but there are some major cliques within the office, and the interns are divided, making it hard for one intern (hint: me) to get other interns (hint: they are in <i>that</i> section of the office) who have worked here less time to work on a different task than what they deem worth their time.

Thanks.

Signed,
Your determinate intern

PS~ Our IS sucks, and our poor IT guy (who is ironically, very cute) works as late as I do most nights. Read some new business innovation magazines and recognize that in many ways our office is in the stone age! It's embarrassing when I try to share documents with people but don't have the capabilities in our office. *shrug* I guess there is always Zola's on Friday to vent off my consternation.

PPS~ Congrats on recognizing that our database system is not properly tailored to our ORG, I am ultimately pleased top management noticed this!"

Born to parents who were themselves children of the youth that emulated the Diggers, her name is a little too ""hippy"" but I'm sure it suits her well. I am overjoyed to go home soon and meet my new baby niece! She's an Aries like me, so now I have someone else in the family to be on my side with all our damn Tauruses. More than anything, I'm just glad that Julia is excited to have a baby sister. Le sigh, if only I didn't have six projects due next week, I would leave today."

Thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll do everything in my ability to enjoy it all and live to the fullest. Constantly I am amazed but always in the refreshing way. It is nice to have someone who shares in giving and taking, and always does something nice. This S.O. exceeds anything I could think to ask for. My boyfriend even bought me a massage for my birthday- holy gods, that's outrageous! Even though April is stressful and overladen with research papers and book reviews, his Flight of the Concords jokes make me smile. Sweet."

Things at work have been great. We just did a fund raiser a couple of Friday mornings ago, and it raised over $20,000! I was so excited by that, not only because I put a lot of work into it, but because I think there is a strategy shift within Center for Justice lately that could be good for the NP long term growth. And, while this isn't exactly exciting, I'm getting a permanent desk at CFJ, which is normally only a privilege for the consistent law interns. The implications for me getting my own spot with Donna in her office means I'm going to be taking over eTapestry. I actually am not too sure if this is a good system for our NP, but I don't have that call (yet?). If I were done with roaming and more school, Spokane might be a fun place to stick around for a while and try my hand at NP structuring. Hmm- then again not!

Semester is going well in school, so that is really good news. In fact today was the first day all of my thousands of dollars for my education paid off. More on this later possibly, but I (arguably) had an epiphany that resulted from an amass of the information from my upper division classes. Gods, right now I wish I had a reliable supply of grants and capital. That's why Ashley is such a great best friend, she listens to me reach an unbearable pitch as I passionately exclaim and think out loud about possibilities, and she balances my ideas with her own that compliment and expand... more later. :) I'm so excited I can barely think fast enough to contain my own thoughts.

Spring break starts this weekend, super needed too! I'm taking the boyfriend to meet the family, which I'm totally looking forward to. He needs to be put through the hoops, and see Everett. We're going to Anacortes and going to play around in the San Juans for part of the weekend, which despite distaste at first, I'm now excited after looking at all the different outdoors stuff we can do on the water or near it. I miss seeing the ocean or the bay very badly, it's one thing the beauty of the Inland Empire can't offer me. During spring break I hope to concrete plans to visit some family friends who live on Cap Cod this summer, and possibly vising Alexandria.

This week, my body as an entire object, is much less spotted than it has been. I had a very serious, and scary, allergic reaction to a sulfa antibiotic a couple of weekends ago. I've never been so miserable in my life, and in retrospect feel a little slighted by the PA who originally inspected my allergic reaction and all body rash. I think if she had fully asked my symptoms and seen the extent to the rash on my body she might have caught the fact sending me home with oral steroids and an antihistamine would not accomplish calming the reaction. It was probably an IgE reaction, especially considering the sensitivity took a week to manifest. No wonder I had a 102 fever for four days and then had to go on IVs! Good grief. So, this is totally vain of me, but I really hope the effects of the rash/allergic reaction are gone before my birthday. That plaid cocktail dress won't look good with faint spots I think. I can't help worrying they will take a long time to fade from my skin, it's been a week now since I stopped taking any kind of steroid or antihistamine and the whole thing is still heat sensitive- as in it becomes more prominent when my body temp raises, which makes for funny looks sometimes in my pilates class. Woot, unknown allergies."

Life is completely unpredictable. Duh, right? I am adverse to changing plans that I had put into works months ago, but I'm starting to think maybe life has other plans, and who am I to disagree.

Thank you G.E. Moore, because people need to consider the meaning of words more than they often do. You are right C.L. Stevenson, if people don't understand the emotive meaning, do they understand anything? Dear, I wish you would consider the force (illocutionary possibly?) of your words and truly be steeped in their meanings. I don't think you are unauthentic, but I worry how those words ripple effect in my life. Pick up some metaethics between your musings on super coils and diseases please.

All else considered: It's fucking cold in Spokane. There's still a foot or more of snow and I don't see <i>ANY</i> signs of spring in sight. Large sigh, I hope the weather is better for my 21st birthday as I am stubbornly wearing a cocktail dress.

"event","Well, it's official, I've enter the phase in my life where some of my friends are now getting married. I ran into my friend, Brett, who is dating my friend, Danielle, and they got engaged over break. On the whole I'm ecstatic for them, though considering their relationship I know many of the friends within our circle think Brett is making a mistake. Oh well, he seems to think it's for him, and he does care a lot for her. I will say though, for this particular couple, they will be needing marriage counseling maybe both before and after the ""I Do""'s.

On a similar couple-y note, I'm excited for Tim to get back from Wales so all four of us can go snowshoeing. He found a trail that leads to an hot springs. I never thought my best friend and I would be dating guys who were best friends with each other, but despite how cheesy that sounds it is very nice.

With the year fast coming to an end (talk to me in a month after spending actual time in my new classes, then I will say the end isn't soon enough in sight) and getting ready to go to France, I've started thinking about how lame senior year at GU seems in an academic sense. For my major there are internships that you can work for credit, but there are no Thesis Guidance classes, and after all the pomp about ""being inspired"" and ""pursuing [my] dreams"" I would like to find a professor and have them be a mentor on a thesis. Nothing grand, but I have some ideas floating around in my head, and it would be nice if I could really really use my undergrad academic resources to their fullest. Since when I come back after doing nearly all my classes required to graduate I will still need two other classes, I figured I'd have some time. More than likely I will still work at Center for Justice, and heaven knows Donna is more of a Mom than a boss in most ways. Anyway, this is future conjecture, and will be dealt much in the future.

"event","I now understand why insomniacs and termed crazy people look so ragged. I have pulled three all nighters in a row this week (IDIOT!). I ran into a nursing friend of mine who utterly stopped in her tracks and asked what the hell I'd been doing to myself. -Not getting term and research papers done while on Thanksgiving Break of course! Self inflicted torture, so I can't really complain. Finals are hell this year for some reason, go figure. I'm also a little pissed right now because I was denied being on the Back-up Crew for the SEARCH in February. I feel shafted, but I will just write some palanca and do break through I guess?

So, the week seems like it will never end from where I stand right now. I have a double date on Friday, the kind where it isn't casual like the previous ones, and I get to dress up all cute. This sounds nice, especially considering I'm house/dog sitting for my boss this weekend, and have a place to retreat to once all the pomp and high heels are off. Truthfully though, I'm too exhausted and confused to really be excited. I'm more excited my boy's Dad is a Zag fan so we can watch games together, which we might do tonight.

It's snowing in Spokane (STILL) and I'm feeling really weird. I've never been in Spokane for a whole year, especially not during the blisteringly cold months. I feel kind of desolate and alone, but I'm thinking once finals are done it will be amazing. Reading tons and snuggling on the couch, cooking, and long walks. Sounds like I turned 30 or something. I think considering how behind I am in some of my classes, that I'm not going to actually read <i>Maigret</i> and just fake it as much as possible for French class. I'm a horrible student- this coming from the girl who wants to go study in Paris to become more fluent!

I miss my Mom oddly strong this week, and Julia too. She is so adorable. I got her to wear a colander on her head while I was home- super funny. And it seems like everyone and their siblings are getting dogs, which makes me sad because I really want to get a dog. Le sigh- grad school probably wouldn't be as easy with one though.

Happy note for the close of my day: I finished my research paper on Artemisia Gentileschi 45 minutes ahead of schedule, which was estimated to terminate at 3 AM!! I'm really happy about that, and I feel 99% certain this paper will blow my professor out of the water, which I know he will enjoy because I think he worries we don't even know what he talks about in class. Now, if only I could reconcile skipping two classes today to get this paper done..."

I laughed so hard. Also, I was keenly aware of the fact I had once dreamed of starting a tee shirt business with some close friends and still possess the first 200-300 tee shirt ideas, but think the friendships with said people have greatly deteriorated. Maybe when I'm done with school it will happen.

This is full week two of school, week three if we include not the full week we started, and I really oddly miss my family. Sign number one I'm itching to get out despite liking the subject matter: starting a count down of how many weeks are left. Holy God I'm losing my youth and time isn't slowing down! Despite some very hurtful name calling from some cousins, there is a part of me that would like to come home and see the people who know me best. -Open mouth insert foot.- I'm going to be quitting my on-campus job soon and get a better one, one through which I can have weekends off and go home to toss my niece around. For anyone in the Seattle area (Sophia that totally means you for sure) who might have a spare 30 minutes to catch up should try and make some hypothetical time to see me. Anyone up for a CHS reunion? I haven't talked to Tim Gravail since I was a senior in high school.

Ramblings aside, I would just like to note out loud, though we all know it, how not ""with it"" previous generations are when it comes to understand the generation I belong to. Because honestly, who uses the words ""boo,"" ""trippin',"" ""Dawg"" mind you this is not spelled d.o.g., or ""bounce""????? If you understand that the Millenials/Gen Y/Echo Gen/Whatever adjective works are quick and like things to be constantly up dated, then one would understand these terms are relatively out dated yes? Not completely, but for the most part. *le sigh* Enjoy: http://web02.gonzaga.edu/cta/Millennials,%20GU%20presentation,%2009.19.06.htm"

1. List seven habits/quirks/facts about yourself.
2. Tag seven people to do the same.
3. Do not tag the person who tagged you or say that you tag whoever wants to do it.


7 THINGS/QUIRKS/HABITS/FACTS
1. I do not like blenders. Odd right? They make me very nervous, no one I work with knows this. And I have one job where I make smoothies all day with blenders! Work is rough man.

2. Little known fact about me. My Mom is still a big hippy, and so when I was born she decided at the last moment she was worried I would be dropped at birth and so decided to give birth to me on our living room floor. I was supposed to be born on her massage table. Hormonal women, go figure.

3. I have a habit of tapping my nose or my lips when I am absent-mindedly thinking. So how it seems to make me feel better. I always get self conscious when I feel people notice it though.

4. I have a habit of being a Tinker Bell, and I tend to be attracted to Peter Pans. If you don't know what I mean, brush up on female commitment issues.

5. Often, as is my bad habit, I think before I speak and end up mistakenly creating awkwardness or offending someone. Recently I have met an amazing person who thinks this is great and funny about me- needless to say I really enjoy their company because of this.

6. TV isn't something I really watch. Yes I live under a rock, but the few shows I see other people watch make me want to leave the country forever.

7. Right now I work full time while going to school full time. I feel as if no one understands how many new dimensions this brings to my life, and as such I feel a little estranged from my peers because of my circumstance.

While listening to Sufjan Stevens <i>Illinoise</i> I decided to look up John Wayne Gacy, then Jeffery Dahmer, and Ed Gein on Wikipedia. Dumb Dumb Dumb!! So now I'm looking at the Daily Puppy to try and cheer myself up. Grrr- I'm all alone and in the apartment, creepy....."

"event","Rest in peace dear Mrs. Grace Paley, we shall miss any further publications penned from your keen observance and interest in the goings on of real lives. There are only so few strong willed people left in this world. She protested the Iraq War at the age of 79 probably just as energetically as she did the Vietnam War (though thankfully this time she wasn't jailed). Especially for those women from the West coast all their life, her books are a good glimpse into the lives of our sisters from the East coast. Alas, another good feminist is gone.

In other commentary. Every time I'm on time for my conferences with my two best friends one of them - who we shall not disgrace and name- is always late! The few weekends I need to or chose to sleep in past our long standing date and time, she somehow decides to get up early and flip me shit for getting some much needed sleep. Tisk tisk. Next time I'm going to set our conference for 12 so you can hear my phone call to wake you up.

And: yay! I'm totally excited for tomorrow when I go to the books store and with gritted teeth buy a book from the bookstore, then head off to the first day of my second job. Even though I'm apprehensive for some good reasons, I think it shall be good people watching time."

Ruffle, stretch, my dear friend
And spread the wings with which
You preen.
Warble and chirp thoughts and hellos.
Tweeter as you teeter on your perch.

I used to have a friend,
But who has long ago left the nest.
Beyond the scraggly branches lay
Rolling lands and better forage.
I used to have a friend
Whom I lost to a better purpose
Of courtship and preening and gift giving.

No longer do I hear that sweet voice
Full of questions and factoids,
Instead in the blue I hear
The mating call of a bird off
To build his own nest.

Ruffle, stretch, my dear friend
For on occasion I see your tail feathers or hear your song
And know it is you who is hopping 
From branch to branch above me.
Warble a hello, so I might smile
About an old friend I used to know."

"event","Where to start? School starts on the 28th and I'm geekishly looking forward to it. (Okay, so I've never been able to remember and separate in my mind the difference between geek and nerd. I think this will be a problem for me one day.) I have been delving into books, because for some reason I can't seem to drag my ass out of the apartment, or when I do it seems to be for funny reasons. With school starting I'm also starting other things, such as: 1) I've got my second job! YES! I am going in tomorrow morning to fill out paper work, get my uniform, and learn my schedule for my crappy (but much wanted) on campus job with Sodhexo *shudder.* 2) With the students returning, this means Adam and I will be in charge of GUMA and getting our fucking lazy martial arts members to come to meetings. Needless to say, I'm fucked and will have to become a bitch about it I think. 3) I will be going to the orientation at the animal shelter on Napa in September, that is once I get the swing of my new schedule and find my little lulls of free time. 4) Starting to talk seriously with AICU about their programs and- well taking the plunge to go the spring of my senior year. With all confidence, I'm still holding my breath about getting accepted in the program. Scary to the millionth degree.

In other news, and this is something I was sworn not to tell my family (my brother is so weird sometimes, honestly) my sister in-law is pregnant again!!!! When I was home for a four day weekend this last weekend she told me, and I'm super excited. My niece and I have already started talking about what it could be like to have a baby brother or sister. I think she's at a good age, being three and all, because I know once she adjusts she will be very excited. This year has been good for my family in general. My sister came down for my brother's wedding and that was really interesting. After 12 years of practically not talking to the family, she is now calling me on a weekly basis, and calls our Mom too. Cool, consider that a battle that I WON when everyone else in the family said Heather was a lost cause. Looks like I was right huh?

Keeping with a happy vibe, I am totally optimistic about things as much as reasonable and prudent. I love my job at the Center for Justice. Today I went to the Torture Protest put on by PJALS with my coworkers, and felt like maybe I was actually being an active citizen in my city. (I cannot believe I am now calling Spokane my own! But it is home now, there is nothing like coming ""home"" to my apartment and shutting out the world.) Through my job at the Center I've been allowed the chance to meet amazing people. Lawyers from CLEDF in PE, local town block executive members, Democracy School grads, and everyone who associates with the Community Building. Other twenty-somethings who aren't utterly despaired and lazy. I've even made contact with the crazy kids who go to Whitworth- :) Shaina is actually very cool. I love the communities I never have time to read, like saucy_dwellings, Post Secret, the New York Times or the WA Post. I have an object obsession with whatisblik.com and wish I had spare cash to make my sparse room more colorful. Enjoying cooking my random style meals like seafood mixed with Indian food burritos, or making up meals. Today I really enjoyed going with Liz to Madeleine's Cafe and Patisserie for this city's best French food. Even though I'm glad this weekend I'm not planning on going out, it's been very fun to have friends and family come over to Joey and visit Ashley and I. Most of all I think I'm loving the tender and languid beginnings of fall in Spokane. I wish I felt a little more safe walking at dusk/night around Spokane because it is one of the most beautiful times to be out under the trees.

Since this is a long ramble and I'm pretty sure most people don't read my LJ- Ash and I have been having an evolving conversation on love/relationships/society. I've just finished up the book <u>Kiss and Run</u> and while it was very pop psychology/culture, I found there to be some good tidbits within the book about women and their commitment phobic tendencies. But as Liz and I were talking today at work, I think one of the main causes for our fear as a gender is that traditional ideas of love and being in a relationship place a women leaving her passions, career, and dream to be with and follow a wo/man she loves. And in this day an age, why wouldn't I be phobic to commit when there is so much at stake? Everyone is afraid of being rejected yes, but if you have the potential to lose your self identity, would you devote yourself to a relationship when the person IS emotionally available and an active member of the relationship, leaving you with the potential to get hurt should it *gasp* work out? Anyway, I think the final verdict no matter what the evidence, is that whatever other people say we will support each other to have our cake and eat it too. To get more idiotic- it's the 21 century, our relationships are fulfilling, balanced, and have space for each person to have their own life/goals/passions, plus the option to have or not have kids, because god knows they are not the end all be all trophy of a successful partnership.... Right, so when I jotted down all my thoughts in my actual journal they were much more articulate and cohesive, less high schoolish. Whatever though, it's late and I'm really tired.

Current books before school starts (hopefully finished soon after the semester begins):
<b>The Circus in Winter</b>- how could I not read this book?
<b>God is Not Great</b>- keeping an open mind
<b>When Heaven and Earth Changed Places</b>- absolutely fabulous novel
<b>The Universe in a Nutshell</b>- I really doubt I will get to finish this before I have to put it aside for finance books and French labs.... :("

"event","I loved books about strong, adventurous, and true women when I was a kid. The other day in Dr. Large's class we went over Joseph Campbell's hero journey, and all the things such a transformation entails. It made me almost want to laugh when the only female figure Dr. Large could come up with who could truly fit into that category was Ripley in Alien. And the question remains, can she fit into that description of being a hero when she is a woman? Women do such different things with their lives, it can't be possible that they might also undergo a journey into the underworld, have to deal with moral dilemma upon return, and transform into a different person than they had begun. I will continue to adore such movies as <i>Little Women</i>, or books such as <u>Caddie Woodlawn</u>.

Summer in Spokane is hot. I wake each morning praying for rain. Those of you who are in the Seattle area and complaining about the heat- can it. It was a 106 here on Friday last week. What's funny is that the heat makes me miss Lexington, VA and Rochester, MI. There's no escaping the weather, my body is learning to forget the cold. When winter rolls around and it snows I will be in for a mild shock I suppose.

I'm reading <u>Rumor of War</u> and listening to a considerable amount of Phil Ochs. Does anyone remember the country used to have a voice once? The day approaches, sooner and sooner, for the Center for Jusice's first annual Dirty Martinis for Clean Water fund raiser. I'm getting nervous that all we need to do to make the event fly won't be done in time. At the same time I'm really proud of everything my two bosses and I have done to make this thing happen. Come fund raiser night on the Saranac Building's rooftop patio I will enjoy seeing Mayor Hession and all the other young professionals rub elbows and network, at one of Spokane's most eco-friendly buildings, or conscious blocks for that matter.

On a more mental note, I keep waiting for something to happen, though I'm not sure what. For some reason it just seems like I'm waiting for someone to say something to me, or I'm going to ask something and get a reply I'd never have guessed to get. I keep having all these crazy dreams. Well, maybe it's just because I'm wondering when my twenties will become something I find worth while. I'm under the impression people who tell you being young is great aren't telling the whole truth, but that's mainly because I'm bitter about slogging my way through college. If I didn't like Gonzaga I'd be irritated at how much it's costing me.

I HATE MICROSOFT AND ALL THAT IT IS. MORE IMPORTANTLY I HATE PROJECT AND PROJECT PROFESSIONAL. I HOPE MY LAST PROFESSOR TAKES A LONG TIME GETTING BETTER FROM BEING SICK FOR REQUIRING US TO DOWNLOAD BOTH IN ONE WEEK DURING FINALS JUST FOR 6 FUCKING CASE STUDIES! NOT ONLY DO STUDENTS DO POORLY WHEN NOT TRAINED HOW TO USE A PROGRAM, BUT THEIR LAPTOPS BECOME VERY UNHAPPY WHEN EXCESS MS OFFICE SHIT IS PUT ON THEM. FUCK YOU GONZAGA, AND ALL YOUR BUREAUCRATIC BULLSHIT AND PANSYNESS.

IF I EVER HAVE TO DIGEST OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AGAIN LIKE THIS I WILL PUNCH SOMEONE'S BABY WHEN NO ONE EXPECTS IT.

End tirade and my almost apoplexy from annoyance and stress. Gack, even good sex, plenty of sleep, chocolate, or sun can fix horrible finals that last a week.

"event","Sunday mornings.

I really like Sundays, as I am lead to believe many people do. Even in hot sunny Spokane I like them. There are generally four devoted activities on any given Sunday for me. Rush through my three DB's on BB and my two tests for class, which usually get me up in the mornings thank god. BFF conference via MSN which is a lovely tradition being slowly killed by the lack of wireless in the apartment. Oh well, I like Empyrean and Michelle always makes my Chia perfectly. A witty look at Post Secret and musing on which topic I will one day send in my secret on. (<b>BTW please send Ash and I your post secret, .pdf anyone? I like the words, but artistically I stubbornly believe that the images speak volumes about secrets as well</b>).

But my most favorite of all activities on Sunday is reading the New York Times Sunday Book review I get in my inbox. I absolutely adore it. On average I would say I spend about three hours reading reviews, adding them to my Amazon wish list, and tumbling down rabbit holes looking into other titles brought up by similar searches. I can't even count how many books get added each week. Sometimes depending on the subject theme of the books featured it's a lot, other themes bore me so I only browse. Sundays sadden me though. There are so many books spewing off the presses and I will never keep up. As one good friend put it wisely to me the other day, I have all the time in the world to read books, BUT AFTER I GRADUATE- though I do have use of his personal library. No fun really.

Currently I am reading three books aside from my class texts.
The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty- old classic, somewhat dry but still amusing.
Genome by Matt Ridley- exceptional book which I am enjoying, especially the paragraph on monogamy.
Earth Spirit Living by Anne Marie Holmes- the author is a friend of the family and so I'm slowly reading chapters when I have a down moment and feel slightly new age inclined.

<u>Books I recommend despite never having read:</u>
The Last of Her Kind by Sigrid Nunez
Not on Our Watch: The Mission to End Genocide in Darfur and Beyond by Don Cheadle
The Atomic Bazaar: The Rise of the Nuclear Poor by William Langewiesche
The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bolano
The Word According to Eve by Cullen Murphy
The Joy of Drinking by Barbara Holland

All of these are on my ""Get Around to It"" list."

"event","""That Was the Worst Christmas Ever!"" is my favorite song. I totally love Sufjan Stevens Songs for Chirstmas album box set. I can't stop listening to it, even though it's chirstmasy music. It soothes my stressed out nerves. Maybe by the end of the week I'll have lost my voice, I keep hoping it happens (Because I've never lost my voice and I think it'd be cool!).

"event","It snowed!! I am so excited it is beyond belief. Forget how hard the Pass will be. Evan and I talked about how he's going to hit me in the face with a snowball, and how I'd white wash him if he ever did. Snow means taking Julia sleding and building a snow man with her, the very first one as a ""big"" girl who is tettering on the terrible twos. Winter means a mental break with plenty of reading and watching movies and listening to new albums.

I'm also really excited to see everyone from the West Side, everyone. And Meg and Tony's baby girl is to be born soon and I'm all jazzed about that and getting her a stuffed animal that is totally cool. There is so much to think right now I just don't know if I will ever survive the next three weeks of school. My God I'm critiquing <u>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</u> academically- what craziness will come next?

Turkey Break was nice, but too short. I'm exhuasted today despite sleeping most of break. Probably I'm all worn out from being dragged from one person's place to the next. All I can say is thank goodness I had Ashley to guard my back! So much deviancy is going on, so few people are actually clued in on how I'm really feeling, it's a wonder I can speak at all. But, as much as I preach and fear it, the truth will set me free. Ash,Jenny, and I all had a lesson in <i>that</i> last night, which wasn't all too fun. Is it possible for someone to be a hypocrite when her numbers are higher than yours?

Anywho, I've got a nap calling me, that or some major slacking journaling in my real journal. Maybe I'll order a couple of Christmas gifts?"

"event","So I gave up some roots, strong from childhood, a long time ago it seems now. But, because I go to a Catholic school, and because I am currently reading the Torah (which I read 10 wrong chapters in today!!!), and my campus is almost visibly devoid of diversity, I felt the need to note a few things.

One, for Tom: Going to a cemetery is not disrespectful if you show reverence to the graves there!!!! How would you like it if no one visited your grave? Wouldn't you be happier if someone you didn't know showed respect by clearing off your tomb stone? Never again will I listen to a ten minute tirade about how horrible it is to seek out cemeteries during October.

Two: Halloween really shouldn't be about the candy or the partying or the costumes. If at all it <i>can</i> be about changing your appearance to be other than one's self. What it should be about is death, nothing too gothic or dark mind you, but a healthy reflection on a natural process in life. For that matter, I suppose Christmas and Easter and Valentine's Day can all be added to such a list of ""Should be About""'s.

Three: I find it sad to note that our dear little MoonFlower Magick's, home grown in Everett, has been plagued horribly in the past three years. It was recently burned, at it's ""new"" location downtown. I don't know the details because the Helard is a crappy paper and didn't archive anything- but I find it hard to understand why it would A) go undocumented by a local paper, and B) not be taken care of by local authorities to catch an arsonist or electric problem. Is it because the store is pagan in religious affiliation and American status quo feel the need to be very Christian, and presumably therefore unfriendly to others? Not many months before this, while I was living in E-Town again the store front was vandalized with a brick through the window. Now I'm sure the owner, Janna, is very nice, but perhaps she has ruffled the feathers of too many people in downtown? I feel badly because I know the store is a sanctuary for many pagan people in the area. Not only that, but they had/have some great books I was looking forward to reading this winter holiday (damn)!!

Well, that is all I can say regarding integrated pagan society for tonight, Stats homework beckons like the devil. I hope everyone is having a pleasant All Hallow's Eve. Don't forget to try and stomp out any ridiculous preconceptions about witches and black cats and bad luck and all the nonsense, because witches are people too and black cats are actually very nice!!"

"event","The thing that makes me sad is that Empyrean is closed down. Now I know of no good local artist venue and amazing tea. I literally think one could orgasm from how great the tea was. They almost made me think coffee and I could be friends again, but alas. Spokane, why must you refuse change for the better?

Tuesday is Halloween! We're going to try and find 1000 Steps and check it out.... Government road is hard to find though. Halloween weekend has been fun.... I met two Swedish guys who were hot hot hot, and I escaped the Cheney police with Ashley wearing no high heels. Life is grand. Je voudrais avoir des choses bien pour le novembre, ensuite ne personne qui est mauvais humour dans le matin.

Oh final term papers how you regal me with your stunning six page beauty of incompleteness. Hope everyone's midterms ect is/did going/go well.

Random fact for the day: Joe Simpson is the most amazing mountaineer England ever produced. Hands down."

it's amazing what billionaires do with scientists when they're bored.

also, this site is good for those of us younin's: <b>http://www.dontvote.org</b>

for those of us who like to speak proper english: <b>http://wordsmith.org/words/today.html</b>

i like them because they can do things by theme, not only randomly chosen words.

this was pretty funny in an interesting way: <b>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/17/AR2006101701298.html?nav=most_emailed</b>

there's strife in the world and people can't even say thank you when i hold the door open in the pouring rain! okay... i'm done.

my happy band lately has been <b>the la's</b> (thankx mars!), so everyone MUST check them out. look up the song <b>liberty ship, doledrum, feelin', way out, or i can't sleep</b>. they're very early nineties, and i dig the sound.


tomorrow is friday, and i'm happy but sad. all of the girls BUT one flaked out on my hike for this weekend, so i had to cancel due to the fact that it would be uneconomical to actually go now. so lame. oh well, next time i'll be more in their face about sticking to the plans they make three weeks in advance. i guess this means i get to meet marks parents this weekend, which is going to be a bit scary. somehow i think that will bring him closer to making me give an affirmed yes or not to seeing him exclusively.

as an aside, i want to go out on the town. probably going to go to a club this weekend, but for sure i want some culture like a nice opera or something. the dead sea scrolls are in seattle. i'm calling my mom to remind her to buy us tickets, or else i'm road tripping to the next place they're on view.

i wonder what would happen if i denied my heart?? or maybe, if i stopped denying it?
have a wonderful day anyone who happens to see this!"

"event","After 16 long hours in Jepson and Lake Arthur I completed my NOLS Wilderness First Aid course. So excited! Now I know the accepted protocol in the backcountry for dislocations, hypothermia, heat illnesses, broken bones, head injury, and other such fun things. NOLS wasn't terribly impressive though, they don't stress being inventive in scrappy situations. Broken femur? I'm not going to a full head to toe damn it! This is all just in time as well because I am doing my FIRST MARIAN TRIP the weekend of the 20th. :) I talked to Dave (RD) about an all-girl outing and he loved it. So 6 girls are letting me be their guide.

We're going to stay in Cle Elum in Reidun's cabin, littered all over the place. Then Saturday morning we're to hike Olallie and eat lunch at the lake. Then because it's only a 2 day weekend we're booking it back to GU that night. Ah, the beginning of a nice habit.

I'm amused that someone I thought would never do an illicit drug has done it more times, since her first, in a month than most people who use it habitually. Still a hypocrite though. Anywho, it seems like a lot of fem folk are having interesting ""dances"" if you will with the men folk. I wish I were more inclined to put my status on facebook as ""complicated"" but it doesn't matter.

Lately I've been doing some side house hunting with Kate and Loren for next year. We're really hoping to get a 7 bed 3 bath place a couple of blocks past Marian. A 9 person house is very large you say? It will be very fun. All kinds of cocktail and dress up parties will be in order. As well I've been shopping around for aid organizations that will allow me to actually accomplish something in Africa. The Peace Corp people really like me, but I'm not sold on their planning style.

It's only been a while (what, a month 'n a half maybe more?) since I got my tattoo, but I'm ready to go back under the needle. I'm thinking about fleshing out my first one some and adding on the little feather I had wanted by my back dimple. Probably I will wait to get my next one until something crazy happens, I find what I'm vaguely looking for, or for when I get back from my trip abroad. So much emphasis on the future, but what is today but a moment from being tomorrow?

After Thought:
Someone noted that 2006 would be a good year for love and marriage. No kidding. I know three people getting engaged, and one person who knows they will announce their engagement in a couple of years and is currently looking at dresses. Wow. It just seems a little overwhelming to me. On the other hand, I only have two hands yet I'm juggling three balls if you will."

Also exciting, Ashley bought me Turquoise Chucks this weekend and I can't wait to wear them to class. They're my first pair of Chucks.

I hate you, your site kills me.
Last time i ever trust you, you mistrust me and my intentions were to never fall hopelees into this, but the way you make me, sometimes it hurts, so dont deny it.
And i never wanted to feel this way,
your flavor, the entire whole way you.

Screwed me over, i watch you, you watch me, i break you, you break the small stuff.

See how you are dying before, you had the chance.
I still live with you, day by mono
Days are going to end, and then
So sometimes I still want you.
I still miss you.

But then i remember I had those days, and nights, I save those memories, Still waiting, i should stop.
I'm sorry, none of it was your fault.
So be happy, just forget
They say a fool forgives and forgets, but the wise will only forgive and never forgets.

I guess im just a nobody again :'(  Oh well, there are tons of other woman to crush on, sucks i wont do anything with them.  Leaving for bootcamp and all, it just wouldnt be right.  So i will keep on flirting, if i wasnt going, i guess i would be going with connie.  She is very cute ;)  Im sure this chick at my work likes me, she has a nice ass. lol. her name is Katie, but her dad is very phycotic so i will stayt away from that sweet ass.  Cant wat to leave for the Marines, And go and get myself killed.  :D  I still say it, why care about something when it has absolutly no meaning to you.  Think about it. Its life.

"event","Well, i was just started senior year at high school.  i was dating kim for a while now and i just loved her to death.  She always talked about wanting a big house and a big barkyard so she can ddecorate and have kids to play in the back.  All that kind of stuff.  I kind of looked at my life and i was like man, i cant provide that for her, my grades are shitty and i never put much effort into school so college was way out of the question.  The one day i saw this army comercial, it said, ""if you were to write a book about your life, would anyone read it?""  i was like hell no, so i decided to join the Marines.  I really wanted to take care of kim and be with her forever.  And if anyone asked if i would die for kim, i think that just proved it. lol.  As of now i am 03 infantry man a.k.a. grunt!  Later i will try to join special forces reconosence.  Oh yea, i wanna die :-D  Now that we are not going out, i think thats the only thing going for me. :/  i thought of it now, why care about something when i hate it so much(life).  As of right now, the happy memories of what me and kim once had are now just a repeating echo casting through out my body.

I want to date her but i dont, just because the fact that i am leaving for bootcamp very soon.  Marines!  I just couldnt hurt her, it would be too wrong.  I have been having these mix feelings about what to do and i know she wants me to date her.  I have been talkign to Adam and Nate, friends of mine and they have kind of been talking with me, like Adam thought it was a great idea at first, then he thought about what everything is happening in my life at the moments.  So now he is telling me he doesnt think its a good idea and i agree with him, and Nate,m well Nate he just listens but he doesnt disagree.  I dont think i want to date anyone for a while.  The pain Kim put me through and the fear of getting hurt again is always running around in my head.  I think i will stay alone for a long time, even tho it feels like it is murdering me on the inside.  Im sorry connie, im sorry everyone that i hurt."

"event","Well, as i said before, she made me so happy for so long, we went out for almost 3 years.  As i said also, so many memories too.  Then all of a sudden she started to change.  Like i mean everything, but i stood by her.  Well, it all started cause of what happen when she was younger.  When she was like 5,6, or 7 she was raped a couple of times by her own father.  Her father is now put away for malestation of the neibors daughter down the road, but kim still feels scared.  i tell her he isnt here anymore to hurt you and that i will always protect you but she still hurts.  That has to be so tramatic on her. ~jumpo back in the future with me~ later she started to cut herself, there was nothing i could to stop her.  She would do it all the fucken time.  Every scar on her arm was like she was putting another scar on my heart.  Just deep gashes everywere.  i hurt so much...ten she just stopped one.  I found out why, she started to do drugs.  the same shit i fallen into.  I felt so crushed cause she knew about my past and she promised me she would never do drugs.  Over this whole time of cutting and doing drus, she started to lye to me alot more.  Over and over again.  Just hurts cause you know she loves you but she has the audasity to lye straight to your face and you know it!  she started drinking too and shit.  It was getting out of control.  She made it semm like her life was going no where when she was the person bringing it to nowhere.  Then one day her mom couldnt handle it anymore, her mom told me that she gives up on kim and i was her only option left.  Once kim found out she kind of freaked.  A couple days later she broke up with me.  Reasons: She was ruining my life and she was a horrable gf and i could find someone better.  I told her i will wait for her and she said the same for me.  Well after a couple weeks i started to ate someone else.  For like a couple days.  She found out and it crushed her i guess.  She finally realized what she was missing.  But she still did the same things.  She talked about wanting me back but didnt want to change for anything, yet i could change in a heartbeat for her.  1 way road right there.  Dont get me wrong, i still love her, just she hurt me so much and i dont think she realizes how much she has.  Maybe one day, some day she will change.  probably when i am not here, sence i am leavinf for bootcamp soon.  I will explain later."

I guess girls started to think i looked cute. :)  Then i met her, my fucken angel to save me, the one who took all the pain away and started to heal me.  Her name, Kimberly Lynn Tello.  She is so god damn beautiful and sweet!!!  We talked for a couple months and i found out she didnt like guys who smoked.  Well i quit!  So i did for her.  She was dating this guy name Jimmy.  He was a nice guy, he just ignored her.  Later he broke it off with her.  WOOT!  i asked her out 2 weeks later.  SHE said yes because i just asked for a little chance.  God, she is so perfect.  Her smell, her looks, her voice, just everything i loved about her.  So many memorys with this girl.  I lost my virginity to this girl and she lost hers to me!  we tried everything together.  You name it, we did it.  we went together for like almost 3 years.  great times.  And i will never regret anyhting ive done with her.  I love her, i always will.

Damn gorgess i tell you!  well, we dated ofr like 3 months, if that and i found out she was cheating on me with a great friend of mine.  Pissed us the fuck off.  so we got into a fight and i ended up beating his ass with a chain in front of the school.  We later apoligized and ended it with liz...bro's before hoe's bitches!!!

"event","I guess i started to do drugs in like 5th grade, like sniffing permy markers.  Not really big but it got me high.  Later on i started smoking weed, like in 6th grade.  I suppose that aint bad either but it is i guess for as young as i was doing it.  This moved me into doing other drugs, like i remember i tried coke and extecy for the first time.  i got so fucked up, i did acid and others.  You name it, most lie i did it.  i felt broken inside, like something was missing.  It seem'd like drugs were my only escape.  I didnt like coke too much, it hurted my nose way too much. lol.  So i didnt do that for too long.  the others i did.  i did herion once.  I knew it wasnt a good idea but i did it anyway, damn friends, talk me into everything.  well, later that night, all fucked up of course, i saw my friend, whom who was also doing herion, the one who got me to do it, like fell to the ground and started to shake violently, like 20 mins later, he died.  first time i saw a person a die, and one who was a great friend.  I dont remember that night too well, but it was a night i wouldnt really forget either.  I think that was the next morning when i wanted to quit drugs, was the hardest damn thing i have done in my entire life.  Remember this kids...withdrawal sucks ass big time!!!  I went into cold sweats and fucking pani attacks, a whole bunch of shit, emotional break downs, i even started to cut myself to take away my pain.   Big mastake, it was just anther drug to feed on.  But i got myself over that quickly, thank god.  I got myself to quit. I felt great but i still have the urge, i think i always will.  i stilled smoke cigerettes.  But oh well, i quit later.  Just read :)

"event","Well, i dont know really were to start, so i guess i will start talking.  I have grown up living kind of a rough life.  I think alot rougher then most, i cant say i dont try to work things out, because i do, i try really hard and sometimes i just can't do it.  When i was little i watch my dad(drink) beat uo my mom for a bit, i was like 6 but i knew what was happening.  She would go cry and then a little while later my dad would apoligize and everything would be better.  Quite fucked up i think but thats my mom for you.  One day i watch my dad choke he with this chain cause she burnt the chicken while bar-b-Q'ing.  Really stupid isnt it.  After a while my mom left my dad.  For the better she thought and it did turn out great i think.  We moved to this crappy asss town called Saginaw.  But i learned so much here and created so many wonderful memories.  
        Later on, i do not quite remember, but somewere along the line my grandpa played this game with me and my twin bro called ""hide the hands"", if you hadnt guessed, he malested me and my bro.  Dont get me wrong, he loved us dearly, just he loved us a little too much, but only when drunk. Alcoholism runs in my family greatly.  
         Even more later on my mom met my stepdad, he is a great guy but bad to upset him.  He has taught me so much and he has alwasy been there, so he will always be counted as my real dad.  Tere is one problem, as i said before, dont piss him off.  When you did, he would beat my ass.  i think i got almost everyday :-p but it made me stronger.  i got hit for stupid things, like not washing a pan or not vacuming good, stuff liek that.  other than all that he was a great guy.  I gove him credit for never hitting my mom.  Thats what i love about him.  not really complaing or wanting empathy or sympathy.  Just wanted to get it all out.  tell you more later..."

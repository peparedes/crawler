"event","so i sold my old computer.&nbsp; that is, 4 or 5 months old.&nbsp; so now i am buying a new one, and i have decided to go with (*gasp*) intel.&nbsp; so here, for those of you who are interested, is my aprox. 800$ (575 w/out case HDD, and PSU) system.&nbsp; 

first, i got a GIGABYTE mobo, and the p31 version.&nbsp; I know they say you should never save on an intel mobo, but i feel really good about this one.&nbsp; it doesnt have the high-drive RAID, which i would never use,&nbsp; and it has ddr2 1066 memory standard.

next, the big upset processor.&nbsp; an intel E6750, 2.66Ghz, 4MB L2, 1333FSB.&nbsp; I cant not buy intel.&nbsp; in the price range i am looking, they just make a better offer.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was this or the 6400+, which is a 3.2 ghz, 2MB L2, 2000 ""hyper transport,"" for about the same price, but the AMD is 125W, and the intel is 65 W.

i am torn on the ram.&nbsp; My two options right now are both 2G, one is ddr2 (800), 4-4-4-12,&nbsp; and the other is ddr2 (1066) at 5-5-5-12.&nbsp; the 1066 is 40$ more, and i dont really think they will be that different after oc'ing.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; but i dont know!

the biggest risk i am taking here is the video card.&nbsp; i decided to buy the cheapest top-tier 8-series.&nbsp; an 8800GTS 320.&nbsp; I have read a lot about these, and they seem like a good choice for my, since i want to do some, but not a lot, of overclocking.


I know everyone looks forward to my computer purchase updates, so i will post again&nbsp; when i have it all set up."

"event","ok, i have a question.&nbsp; i have an fx5750, which is an overclocked 5700, which i got for free, to play around with because the fan had died.&nbsp; so i strapped an AMD factory CPU fan to the heatsink (the CPU's heatsink was messed up) , and powered it on.&nbsp; so far, no problem.&nbsp; only thing is, because it is an msi, them temp control was built in to the fan.&nbsp; so now i have no report on the temperature.&nbsp; So am i risking my system if i overclock the gpu until it melts into a pretty pile of goo?&nbsp; i dont think so, but i wanted to hear it from others."

"event","<p>So i have been working on computers for extra money for a while now.&nbsp; I have been doing preaty well, so far, but i have been killing myself about learning laptop hardware.&nbsp; so my boss wanted me to look at this girl/woman's laptop.&nbsp;She runs his horse farm.&nbsp; Weird, huh?&nbsp; Anyway, so at first i was like, 'no, i dont do laptops,' but then i thought to myself, well, its just the cpu fan, how hard can it be? i have changed hundreds of cpu fans, and i keep in stock a wide range of fans of all shapes/sizes.&nbsp; well, first bad sign was, i needed to look at the manual to figure out how to get the godamn case open.&nbsp; I dont think i have ever used a manual for anything but voltage jumpers in, well, ever.&nbsp; but for this, i couldnt get into the damn case w/ out it.&nbsp;i had to REMOVE THE MONITOR TO GET THE CASE OPEN.&nbsp; Rediculus.&nbsp; and at first, i wanted to blame the oem company for it, but i am sure they are all that retarded.&nbsp; had to take out the ""pci"" cards, too.&nbsp; And!&nbsp; the screws on the case were sunk in to far for a normal screwdriver, which i thought was not a problem, because i have one of those little ones.&nbsp; you know, the ones with the metal grip, that fuck your fingers up if you use them too much?&nbsp; oh, and the decided it was absolutely critical that they GLUE THE SCREWS IN. B a s t a r d s !&nbsp; so now i have blisters on BOTH my pointer fingers.&nbsp; So, then, after i took all of the parts out of the laptop, so i could get to the damn fan, i came upon a new puzzle.&nbsp; the fan is like no fan i have ever seen.&nbsp; its not even really a fan.&nbsp; more like a waterwheel for air.&nbsp; buggerit.&nbsp; it doesnt use the regular airfoil type design, but it actualy pushes the air with a flat blade.&nbsp; rediculus.&nbsp; well, whatever, you learn something new every day, ill have to spend 20$ on a new one... WRONG!&nbsp; now, before i continue this part of the rant, i would like to point out, there is NOTHING fancy about this fan. it is not ""cool 'n quiet"" compatable, it is not software driven, it doesnt even have a heatsink attached to it.&nbsp; its a damn moter with fins.&nbsp; $79....<br /><u>$79. </u>the fan costs more than a GIG OF LAPTOP PC 3200!&nbsp; so now i am trying to figure out what i can rig it with without giving the theiving blighters more money just because their product stopped working.&nbsp; im so pissed off, i am not even going to spell check.&nbsp; oh, and stevi is moving in tomorrow till the end of the year.&nbsp; and my dad got a job in DC.<br />~R</p>"

"event","<p>First off, i thought i would use this since i thought everyone else did, but now i remember why i didnt, because i feel like i am talking to myself.&nbsp; Not that there is anything specifically wrong with talking to one's self...<br /><br />So i mentioned the other day that i have no angst to offer livejournal, and that i felt like i wasnt pulling my weight.&nbsp; So, in honor of my secret&nbsp; ""Xanga"" account (S/N DarkEmeraldyWhore6969), and my incapability to reason, i thought i would air the only angst i have...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am upset with the social and political direction of this country.&nbsp; Not in the terrorist sort of way, either.&nbsp; My reasons just keep stacking up, and i am getting really fed up.&nbsp; First and weighting in at about 75% of why, is the fact that we are letting religion take such a grasp of our government.&nbsp; Now, i have nothing against religion.&nbsp; Well, maybe ""nothing"" is to strong of a word... I would have nothing against religion as an idea, if it didnt have the sort of viral self replicating features that it has, I.E. hell, decipling.&nbsp; But when ""your"" religion gets in the way of my life, then i get irritated.&nbsp; some examples:&nbsp; Restrictions of funding toward stem-cell research, because Jesus.&nbsp; Not just that, but then claiming that you are making a moralistic argument. BULLSHIT! Preventing ""gays"" from getting married, because Jesus.&nbsp; And then claiming that you are trying to ""save the institution of marriage,""&nbsp; when the devorce rate in this country ""under god"" is more than 50%.&nbsp; I bet it would go down if we got rid of the idiotic religious anti-gay sentiment. BULLSHIT!&nbsp; Making churches tax free.&nbsp; Who the hell came up with that anyway?&nbsp; Why should religion, which throws around billions of dollars a year get a break, when other similar bad habits (Drinking, smoking, drugs, gambling...)&nbsp;are either taxed EXTRA, or simply made illegal? BULLSHIT!&nbsp; Jesus fishes.&nbsp; enough said. BULLSHIT!&nbsp; Church cops!&nbsp; BULLSHIT!&nbsp; Anti-abortion rights marches. BULLSHIT!&nbsp; I could go on and on but i am out of things to say about that.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second biggest thing that pisses me off is really two things.&nbsp; The state of healthcare/employment in this country.&nbsp; Here we are, the biggest, richest, most powerful nation on the planet, and better than 15% of our people are uninsured.&nbsp; Insurance can easly cost 500 a month which is about, oh, 40ish% MORE THAN I PAY FOR MY HOUSE! bullshitbullshitbullshit.&nbsp; BULLSHIT!&nbsp; minimum wage here is ridiculous.&nbsp; even the proposed 7.25 is insane.&nbsp; Now, i have always argued that minimum wage should be low enough that people feel like it is worth it to get an education, and get up from rock freaking bottom, but then, look at how hard it is to go to school in this country!&nbsp; Even with need-based scholarship an loans, you are going into stupid amounts of debt.&nbsp; AND a bachelor's degree does by no means mean you are going to be able to get a job that offers insurance.&nbsp; BULLSHIT!&nbsp; especialy in the South East.&nbsp; Unless you work for a church (now, theres an idea.)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, i am pissed about the transportation situation.&nbsp; This is sort of a personality thing, but i am pretty sure that people who drive big cars are stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Will and baseball caps.&nbsp; And the more you drive your big car, the stupider you&nbsp;get.&nbsp;&nbsp; But really.&nbsp; People argue that they want to drive big cars because they are safer, but if everyone drove small cars, everyone would be safer (especially pedestrians, but noone sees them anymore, anyway.)&nbsp; Taxes dont fix the roads fast enough for the damage one by heavy cars, and gas taxes are to low for the capital to fix them.&nbsp; and for you libertarians out there who are reading this, your system is stupid.&nbsp; but that is another argument.&nbsp; an in alabama there is no EPA regulation of car emissions, which i think is silly.<br />That is the end of my rant for now, i will probably add things as my fallow Americans remind me of why i and irritated.<br /><br />~R<br /></p>"

So no more. no more will i fear people, change, and independance.  the longer i wait here in stagnation, the harder it is going to be to get out when i have to. i have been willing to settle for a job that sucks, and all of that for too long.  the only thing that still makes me sad is, like jason says, i am going to miss being made fun of.  but that is just another security issue...  i have friends here, but i havnt made any new ones in 4 YEARS, because i am content... well, no more. have more to say, bu i have to pay mfor my class now...

"event","wow, 2 posts in a day.  if only people read this,  would feel accomplished.

So i had a strange experiance today.  I saw myself from(literaly) all sides.  i know that this seems like it shouldnt be all that strange, but considering recent events, i have been doing alot of self-examination...  It turns out that the way i think i look is not at all the way i really look.  now, dont get me worng, i never thought i was particularly attractive, but i thought i would stand out, one way or another.  But today, out of the corner of my eye, i wondered why i could see that guy in the mirror.  it could have been anybody.  and i know this sounds narcissistic, but i just have always assumed i looked different, not better, just different... it was strange.
  which brings me to something i think about often.  how knowing people changes what they look like to us.  But even more, how what we know (or think we know) changes the way we see ourselves, Physically. but enough of this.

  so clint and lydia are getting married.  i know some of you may think this is strange, but i really am happy for them, because i think they are both really happy.  I will say it now, and i will say it again, good luck to them...  we all need luck.

I am feeling strange tonight. trying to come to terms with some stuff.  sorry if i seem more rambling than usual.

"event","another long day in a long strong of long days(except for last weekend, and then the days were painfully short). i have decided to leave an issue alone.  so it is not that i am ignoring it, it is just that there can be no good come of talking about it.
I have so much thinking going on that it really seems like it is going to make me crazy.  I cant wait to get out of huntsville.  I dont really care where it is i go, but B-ham in convinient, so i will go there... after summer semester, of course.  There are no new people for me to meet here. i have to go to a place where i dont know anyone, and i am absolutly forced to make friends.  I need to find myself. Have though for a long time that i knew who i was, but everthing that had made me think that has changed.  I am no longer the person i was. i am not even myself anymore.  I am lost in a world where nothing is familiar and safe, and the only light is in getting away from everything i know and starting over.  when was the last time that i did anything?  the last choice i made without considering it through the filters of what other people(or atleast what i though other people) thought?  Everthing i do to help myself ends up hurting me, and even the things i do to hurt me dont work right.  I have lost more faith in people than i even knew i had...  UGH.

On a lighter note, i am glad ashley is back with...mmm...that guy(whatever his name is)...   dont let anything come between you and the one you love.  even if that means letting them go for a while.  (boy its hard for me to say that.)

"event","ugh.  i feel like crap. not really in that sick sort of way, either(even tho i am sort of sick{but i take my vitamins, so i dont get worse{hint hint}]).  My brain hurts. i am thinking myself in circles.  it is a new feeing to me.  it really is like i am arguing with myself.  Like, part of me (i think this one is the republican) wants to be pissed off, and hate people, but another part of me (the liberal) wants to say its cool, let things go the way they will and just take this as an opertunity.  each of the 2 have preaty good arguments, and every time the Reds begin to win, the libs just fillibuster 'till i get tired of thinking.  this wouldnt be all that strange, except that it really leads to me not thinking about it, so any reminder really fucks me up, like stops me in my tracks... Makes it Damn hard to work.

Also, it makes my dealings with people difficult.  The way i am used to dealing with this kind of thing is just getting really pissed, throwing things around and drinking 'till i feel better.  but i dont want to do that now.  I dont want to poison the memories... but i digress(is that the right word? i am sure i will hear if  it is not)...  people:  so i have these kind of explosive thoughts, but they all get shouted down by 3 years of happiness, and end up just causing me to not know how to act with people.  Like i dont know what to tell people when they ask how i am doing.  R:how am i doing? what the hell do you mean how am i doing? i have just taken the biggest betrayal POSSIBLE, so many promises broken at once they cant be counted!...D:i am doing well, i am moving foreward and upward and looking foreward to next year (358)...
You see what i mean?

Enough of that. back to making sence.  the grossest thing possible happened today, while i was at work.**warning, if you are easly put off you lunch, DONT READ THIS!** my cat made a hairball on my bedsheets... probably not that gross for other people, but they are my bedsheets, so...

In conclusion(i still write like this is a eng101 paper), today sucked, tomorow will be worse, and i hope those people who were supposed to call me call me at some point.

"event","Well, i figure if i am going to pry in everyone else's journals, i might as well do one of my own.  first off, i would like to apologize for the Hyper Old School name i used, but i want to get away from hexr, and i am not that creative.

Long day today.  didnt sleep much last night, thinking about what thin ice i am on with everything... i am afraid of pissing people off, but i guess i should live for myself now that i dont have a choice.  and i ought to be studying, because i think i am going to fail my phs220 class,(human sexuality) but it is stuff on romantic love and intimate relationships and marriage, and i am anything but in the mood.  And i am really nervous about getting accepted to UAB, because i turned my application in on the absolute deadline... Hell.

you know what sucks?  Claire's guitar is sitting next to my computer.... taunting me.  But she is coming to town this weekend, and that makes me happy.  I miss her, even though i am not allowed to miss her ""like that"" i really enjoy being with her, even if it can only be as friends.  I know, one of you (if you read this) is going to bitch about me being oversentimental, but i am not. i am just trying to tell the truth.  

this should be a fun night.  there is a chance i might actually get to hang out!(whoa!)  Crown is in town, which always leads to interesting things.
Well, since i am already trying to avoid talking about what is on my mind, i am going to stop for now.

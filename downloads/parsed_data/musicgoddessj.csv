"event","oh kay... so... where did I leave off?

ahhh that's right... i left off with telling about my good day turned crappy turned good again... on that subject i have to fucking wait until i go home to have my ipod fixed. uggh... pissed. can i just say im really pissed.

can i just say that my account is majorly overdrawn, by like $118... yea... really not cool... fuckign hotel... did i tell you all why i didnt have a room?

WELL!!!! apparently the third girl in our room decided to take the room for herself with 2 other friends and had my dad pay for it.  yea.  im not happy. i paid extra and so did my father and it pissed me off.

soooo yesterday... my first day of class... gave me a fucking headache. the teachers only speak in italian and broken english.  oye.  but im learning a lot. thats always a good thing. i get out around 1240... and then i go to the api office to use the computers.
and yea, its all good... i should be able to catch email and comments regularly... kind of... lol
last night we went out for a school dinner... it was cool, reletively good food... and a waiter that constantly watched me, winked at me, blew kisses at me... etc... and yea, he wasnt hott or young... caressed my arm and kissed my cheek at the end of the 1 and a half liter bottle of wine 5 of us kind of shared... lets just say the sharing wasnt completely fair... lol
but yea... it was funny then we left the creepy waiter, who wanted to go to the bathroom with me... a little creepy? maybe... and we got some gelato, i got rose and bacio, sooo good, and we met some good ole american homies... they bought me my gelato, how sweet of them! and i was super drunk... lol it was awesomely funny!
and then i saw debra scurto-davis, met her son and husband... and sobered up really quickly...
after that there was an awesome waltz being played in the piazza nearby, which i drunkenly danced to... well not really drunk, but happy.  and a group of italian guys were walking towards us and hugged me with un bacio for my cheek, it was cute.  i really had to pee so we went to mcdonalds and we all peed and then we continued on home... where i called mike and chatted* with him on the way to my flat wiht my mates... and then we went to bed...

today is kidna crappy... its wet and rainy kinda chilly... im hungry and broke, and so theres only one thing i can do... sleep.
perhaps wake up in the morning... go to class... and do it all again... 
so i think thats what i'll do...
bye all... for now... forever... ha who knows...

*going to be a separate post for friends only."

"event","well.
i would have written yesterday, but i decided i was in too much of a bad mood to do so.

OK.
so.

we went to Sienna... kinda boring, but cool in it's small town richfieldy sort of way... but a bit more medieval and italian... lol
i bought a sweet necklace and almost a bathing suit, as i have to anyway, i'm going sailing for three days in the italian riviera :)

and tehn after getting lost with hayden <- kinda talkative... lol, i'll tell you all later... we found where we need to go and went to a family farm where we had a lovely tuscan lunch... wow, it was great! :) we tehn explored the farm and winery and i bought 3 bottles of wine, 1 red and 2 white, all natural, beautiful, 2 were in a box and the other in my bag... soooooooooo... after that we went on an annoying hike to the top of San Gimignamo with teh obnoxious tour leader... oye... and then we had to walk down to the buses afterwards... and Gris and i had to pee, so we paid 1E and entered this little WC, but there was only a porcelein hole in the ground. yea. i did a crabwalk pose to piss in a hole in the ground. it was great... but atleast i didn't get piss on my clothes like poor Gris' skirt... eek... but yea, so then we went home...

needless to say this is an abridged version since i have limited time here... but ah, i'll tell you all my misery in a moment.

i got off the bus and my bag hit the railing of the bus, the wine started leaking thru my bag and i was like, ummmmmmmm... what?  so then i take out the bottle to see what happened and my white wine dumps all over my ipod and sweater, all my orientation materials, and lets just say, i was NOT happy.  my ipod is still drying.  i want to cry.
then i dropped my cell and that smashed around on the road... not cool... but i fixed that, then we went back home and so on with the night... 

i'll write later about my horrible loss of about 40E today.
<3 u all.
esp. mikey."

"event","Wow!
okay... where to begin...
i got into florence yesterday afternoon, settled into my AMAZING apartment, napped, put things away, and so on... then went for dinner at a hotel for orientation to florence, and then went to a serial killer museum!! :D :D :D
so freakin cool!!
but not on the first night... we got lost going back to our apartment and then were scared that some deranged psycho would climb into our apartment and kill us. haha... but no worries, the US has 58% (1290 people) of all serial killers... hahahaha... oh man...

so right now i'm on a computer at a place called internet train where you pay so much to use the computer and internet...
i finally got the unlock code for my phone, so i put in my TIM SIM card and now can use my razr... woot! yay for that!

today we went and looked around florence... amazing! i get student discounts just about everywhere on everything! its awesome.  i'm going to come home with like 3 leather coats with sweet fur attatched... and i totally say i'm from outside toronto canada, only because we all know, no one likes an american.  sad but true.  they give better pricing and better service to non americans.  yup.
i can't wait... i'm totally gonna get everyone a pashmina and a bracelette i think... and yea... good times

i totally signed up to go on a 2 day trip to the islands... aka a boating trip to awesome italian islands! i'm finally going to see the ocean!! :D :D :D
i need a bathing suit... 

aaaaaaaaannnnnnndddddddd tomorrow we're going to san gimignano! and sienna i think is the other place... woo for traveling!
and the wine is soo great here... love it... i love it... 
and just for the record... i kinda miss the states... 
and mike.
i miss him a lot...sigh... 
but yea... 
i'll talk to you all soon!! i need to put more time on my internet card!
love you all soo much!!
<3 kisses from italy! ciao ciao!!"

Your birth on the 9th day of the month adds a tone of idealism and humanitarianism to your nature. 
You become one who can work easily with people because you are broadminded, tolerant and generous. 
You are ever sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and  you are very sympathetic and compassionate. 

Your feelings run deep and you often find yourself in dramatically charged situations. 
This 9 energy always tends to give more that it gets.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

"event","It has been absolutely forever since I've written anything here.  But between student teaching, graduation, moving out of my apartment, and the fact that until recently nothing exciting was happening on the wedding planning front anyway, I guess it's not that big a deal.

Anyway, our date (07.07.07) is on the church calendar at <a href=""http://trinitychurchgso.org""target=""blank"">Trinity</a href> and Daddy called to reserve the <a href=""http://www.kressterrace.com""target=""blank"">Kress Terrace</a href> last week.  I'm so excited!  

My cousin Brian is getting married this weekend.  I think his wedding is going to be really...high society.  More chic than I really want mine to be, and not kid friendly.  Which is fine with me if that's what they want, but it's not really my style.  I do want something really nice, but not so formal and upscale, I think.  We'll see.  I think it'll be good for my parents to go to a wedding like this.  I mean, they've never been to a wedding with a dinner-and-dancing reception after, except Jonathan and Laura's last year, and that wasn't quite right either.  Hmm...what I mean about both Brian and Jonathan's weddings is that they are not quite in sync with what I want for MY celebration.  Jonathan and Laura's wedding was gorgeous and perfect, and I know Kate and Brian's will be too.  They're just not me.  :)

Anyway, I've been to look at dresses twice...I saw several things I liked, but I can't post the pictures here because Matt can't see them before the wedding.  *grin*  I haven't found a dress that I <i>knew</i> was The One, though, like so many women have claimed they did.  I'm not going to try on 300 dresses in search of that epiphany, though.  I've been to David's Bridal twice (and I like their service, if it is a little...pushy...sometimes), but I'd like to try some other places, like Bridal Mart in Burlington (I've heard it's terribly impersonal, but they do carry Alfred Angelo, who I like), the bridal store at Concord Mills (which is where Margo's girls found their dresses), and the dress shop in Yadkinville (highly recommended by my aunt, who found her mother-of-the-groom dress there).  I might also go to Josette's on State Street, just to round out my boutique experience.  And who knows.  There's a great dress shop in Lexington.  Mom and Sandy and I went there when I was shopping for my senior prom dress and I remember that they had some lovely gowns.  That seems like a lifetime ago.  Wow.  So, suffice it to say that there are plenty of options.  I'd like to do a lot of shopping like that this summer so that I know basically what I want by the time I move in the fall.

Next on my to do list are save the dates.  I'd really like to go order them sometime next week, but we'll see.  I'd like to include Matt in the picking out process, so maybe I should wait one more week.  Hmm.  That would be good, too, because his parents would be back from Peru so he could hound them about a tenative guest list and addresses.  *grin*

Also on the list for this summer are interviewing caterers, visiting the Kress at about the right time of day (they have a thing called Friday's at Five with music and dancing on the terrace every Friday in the summer...how convenient, especially since July 7 is a Friday this year...what could be more perfect?), figuring out the types of flowers and maybe talking to a florist in July, and asking the rest of my girls to be bridesmaids.  Yay!

I really am so excited.  I have a great wedding planning notebook from Barnes & Noble and I have so many ideas tucked away in a binder.  There are so many great ways to make this wedding ours.  It's very exciting."

I don't think I want to buy this set, but I do want to do something like this.  I think I can personalize it and make it even better.  :)  

I also saw some little votive candle holders which would be cute, but I bet I can find them cheaper at a wholesale store, dollar store, or online wholesaler.  :)  I'll keep looking.

Matt said I couldn't have 343 of anything at our wedding.  :P  Which is ok, since it's just a math geek joke anyway.  (Briefly, every date that has any significance for us is a 7 or a multiple of 7 (14, 21, 28).  Our wedding date is 07-07-07.  7x7x7, or 7 cubed, is 343.)  HOWEVER, I do plan on having 7 of something in all the centerpieces.  Odd numbers are more pleasing to the eye anyway, so I can enjoy the little joke, indulge my inner romantic, and create pretty centerpieces all at once.  *grin*

I should be lesson planning instead of wedding planning.  I have to admit, as much as I'd rather get married this coming summer, I'm glad I'm not trying to do wedding and lesson plans at the same time.  *whew*  It's going to be hard next year too, but hopefully not in the same ways.  :)  So, back to the Pink Panther and lesson plans.  :)"

"event","We looked at wedding bands in Reed's this weekend!  We both found rings we really like.  :)  The one I like is a 2mm white gold plain band that matches my engagement ring beautifully.  I tried it on and I really like the way it looks.  Yay!  Matt found one that's made of tungsten carbide and has a kind of darker finish and a pattern of celtic knots engraved on the surface.  It's a very good looking ring and I think it suits him well.  We decided to go back in a couple of months and look again and see if he still likes it.  Yay!

A friend of mine who got engaged a month or so after we did and who is getting married two weeks before we are has already bought her wedding dress.  I cannot <i>imagine</i> having my wedding dress already.  I don't trust myself to weigh the same as I do now in eighteen months.  CRAZY!  

There's a bridal show in Greensboro next weekend and one in Winston Salem the weekend after that.  I can't go to either, but hopefully there will be another one later in the spring.  

I am having lots of fun tearing pages out of magazines and printing stuff offline and putting together a notebook of stuff I like.  It's so exciting.  I've been looking at wedding cakes and stuff.  I also found a couple of hairstyles I actually like and think would work.  :)  

To Do in January and February:
-Call Mark Putnam and confirm that we can get married at Trinity on the day that we want and talk to him about what we need to do to make that happen.
-Confirm date with both sets of parents.  (And maybe Matt's best man and my maid of honor, although I think that they'll be fine with it either way.)
-Reserve Kress Terrace for the day we want.
-Ask Steve and Margo and my parents to start compiling a list of people who should get a Save-the-Date this spring/summer.  
-Finish scrapbook to date.  :)
-Start collecting cute kid pictures of both of us for a slideshow (so we have plenty of time to make it nice-looking)."

"event","As a supremely unsuperstitious person, this amuses me.  :)

Anyway, I know I haven't posted here in forever, but honestly there's been nothing to say.  :/  Hopefully that will continue to change.  It's very hard to watch girls who got engaged after me start planning, when I really haven't gotten to enjoy that yet.  BUT we will persevere and all will eventually be well.

Things we have done:

-Mom and I went to a stationery store in Greensboro over Thanksgiving and looked at Save the Dates.  I really want to do this because it is a nice way for my parents to acknowledge us and start the ball rolling.  I am hoping to order them no later than April and send them out no later than June, which is about a year in advance.  Waiting any long seems silly, but I don't want to send them too early, either.  Sending them in May would be OK if they are ready, too.

-Matt and I went back to the same store over Christmas break.  It was a nice couply thing to do...we were both out running errands, so we met for lunch nearby and then walked over to the stationery store.  :)  He liked a lot of the ones that I showed him, I think.  At least, his responses were positive.  :)

-We have started telling people a wedding date, but it's odd because it was chosen almost by default.  I want to discuss it seriously one more time with Matt and with our parents before I put it up here for all the world to see.  Still, it's very exciting to have a date in mind.  :)

-A couple of nights ago I spent a long time online looking at pictures of wedding cakes.  Hehehehe.  That was fun, even if it was just an idea gathering exercise.  :)

So, more updates soon, I hope, as things start happening."

"event","I just wanted to post...I feel like I've abandoned this journal already, and it's only been a month!  Sad.  But between the stresses of school (this semester is awful) and the stresses of family, I really haven't had any energy to put into wedding planning.

Is it normal for the first blush of excitement to wear off so quickly?  I keep telling myself it's because there's been so much controversy.  I think that's a big part of it, too, because I still get distracted by how beautiful my ring is and I still daydream about being Matt's wife.  :)  It's just so stressful to do actual wedding planning, even if it is only idea stuff, that I'm not as into it right now.

Hopefully all that will clear up soon.  I am still just as excited as ever about getting married, even if the planning stresses me out.  ;)  

On an idea-related note, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of using green.  One of the great things about green is that not everything has to be exactly the same color.  As long as none of the greens are too extreme (<b><font color=""#00FF00"">lime</font color>, <font color=""#003300"">hunter</font color></b>, etc), it's ok to blend <b><font color=""#669966"">sage</b></font color> and <b><font color=""#66CC66"">spring</font color></b> and <b><font color=""#006633"">ivy</font color></b> greens into a lovely, lively color scheme.  So I think green (<b><font color=""#669966"">sage</font color></b> for dresses) with white/cream and black accents.  :)"

"event","I've had lots of new ideas today!  I got a catalog from <a href=""http://www.myjeanm.com""target=""blank"">Jean M</a> in the mail this morning, and class was so boring that I looked through the whole thing.  Most of the stuff is way too expensive, no matter what our budget may be, but I loved some of the things I saw. 

<u><b>Favors</u></b>:  CD's of our wedding music, both from the ceremony and the reception.  There are great ways to package them using coordinating colors, and it's a relatively inexpensive option, because Matt and I can burn the CD's ourselves...I'm sure that our friends with CD burners would be glad to help us, and Margo has a great CD label creator.  

<u><b>Cameras</u></b>:  I want to put disposable cameras around the reception room, possibly on every other table or something like that.  I found the appropriate wording for the attendant cards today.  I'll print them up myself, possibly on invitation stock.  They will have the following verse on them:

<p align=center><i>Join in the fun<br>on our special day;<br>capture some memories<br>in your own special way!<br><br>Take a few pictures and<br>then pass it on;<br>leave it on the table<br>when the exposures are all gone!<br><br>We can't wait to see what developed!</i></p align=center>

I also found a really neat <a href=""http://www.myjeanm.com/PunchOut.cfm?strShobaMainwww.myjeanm.com=562185705&intSiteID=575&strURL=http%3A%2F%2Fppe%2Ejeanmessentials%2Ecom%2Fpunchout%2Ecfm%3FAction%3DADD%26ShobaID%3D11305243%26pageID%3D1038%26iCatalogCodeID%3D2700%26iCatID%3D11241""target=""blank"">Photo List Card</a>!  I love this idea, but I'm not sure people would actually do it.  The idea is that they take a picture with one of the cameras, then make a note on the card about the picture they took.  It's a great way to keep track of who took which pictures and what exactly is going on in them, but it might be too confusing.  Obviously, I'm on the fence.  I guess they're not too expensive...I could just order one set of 10 at $5.00 and try it.  :)

<b><u>Table Numbers and Place Cards</b></u>:  If I go with green, I can't think of anything cooler...now, whether or not I can afford it is another thing entirely.  But here goes anyway.  First, we use large magnet boards or cookie sheets (which we could then take home...) and magnetic poetry words (maybe the   <a href=""http://www.magneticpoetry.com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=3025""target=""blank"">Romance Kit</a> or the <a href=""http://www.magneticpoetry.com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=3035""target=""blank"">Love Kit</a>) to display the table cards, <a href=""http://www.myjeanm.com/PunchOut.cfm?strShobaMainwww.myjeanm.com=562185705&intSiteID=575&strURL=http%3A%2F%2Fppe%2Ejeanmessentials%2Ecom%2Fpunchout%2Ecfm%3FAction%3DADD%26ShobaID%3D11305243%26pageID%3D1038%26iCatalogCodeID%3D2700%26iCatID%3D11241""target=""blank"">like this</a>.

Then we use <a href=""http://www.myjeanm.com/PunchOut.cfm?strShobaMainwww.myjeanm.com=562185705&intSiteID=575&strURL=http%3A%2F%2Fppe%2Ejeanmessentials%2Ecom%2Fpunchout%2Ecfm%3FAction%3DADD%26ShobaID%3D11305243%26pageID%3D1038%26iCatalogCodeID%3D2700%26iCatID%3D11241""target=""blank"">white push pins</a> to attach individual place cards to Granny Smith apples, just like in the picture.  At first, I wasn't sure about using fruit, but the more I think about it, the more I like it!  It would be so easy to put together, unique, and possibly affordable.  Maybe Uncle David could get me a couple of cases of apples the week before the wedding.  Hmm.  It's definitely a thought.  *grin*

<b><u>Cake Toppers</b></u>:  There were several nice cake toppers in the Jean M catalog.  I like the idea of using our initials somehow.  These <a href=""http://www.myjeanm.com/PunchOut.cfm?strShobaMainwww.myjeanm.com=562185705&intSiteID=575&strURL=http%3A%2F%2Fppe%2Ejeanmessentials%2Ecom%2Fpunchout%2Ecfm%3FAction%3DADD%26ShobaID%3D11305243%26pageID%3D1038%26iCatalogCodeID%3D2700%26iCatID%3D11241""target=""blank"">wooden letters</a> are nice.  Even though they're not listed on the website, the catalog says there are trays which hold 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 letters.  There are also great <a href=""http://www.myjeanm.com/PunchOut.cfm?strShobaMainwww.myjeanm.com=562185705&intSiteID=575&strURL=http%3A%2F%2Fppe%2Ejeanmessentials%2Ecom%2Fpunchout%2Ecfm%3FAction%3DADD%26ShobaID%3D11305243%26pageID%3D1038%26iCatalogCodeID%3D2700%26iCatID%3D11241""target=""blank"">wooden hearts</a> which fit in the same trays.  We could do ""E *heart* M"" or something like that.  I wish they had green hearts, but black or white would work, or we could paint it green.  There are also several clear acrylic cake toppers which can be engraved with our names, my new monogram, just a simple R, or any number of quotes and sayings.  These may be worth looking into as well.

I think that's enough for now.  :)  I've been adding to this post all afternoon!  *grin*  Leave me messages and let me know what you think!"

First off, <a href=""http://weddingshop.theknot.com/weddingwarehouse/ProductPage.aspx?scId=Wedding%20Cameras&pId=P396&cId=Reception""target=""blank"">cameras</a>.  I think it would be awesome to order some of these to put around on the tables at the reception.  Although there would probably be lots of not-so-good pictures, there would also be lots of ready-made scrapbook pictures and great candid shots.  I like this idea, and I like the green these come in.  I also like their price right now.  Hmm...if the price hasn't changed on Monday, maybe I'll think about ordering some.  

Second, cake toppers.  Now, obviously I don't know yet even who is baking my cake.  Matt's family knows a lady who does cakes...she did Heather's and I seem to remember it being very good.  :)  Yum.  But it might be easist to start with a cake topper and work from there with cake design, etc.  So, there's the <a href=""http://weddingshop.theknot.com/weddingwarehouse/ProductPage.aspx?scId=Cake%20Toppers&pId=P918&cId=Reception""target=blank"">initial cake topper</a>, which would of course be an R.  There's also the <a href=""http://weddingshop.theknot.com/weddingwarehouse/ProductPage.aspx?scId=Cake%20Toppers&pId=P912&cId=Reception""target=""blank"">Oh, no you don't!</a> cake topper, which is funny, but maybe not quite our style.  ;)  I like the initial one, but I think I'll keep looking before I make up my mind.

Third, music.  I don't know yet.

Fourth, flowers.  Scary...;)  But I can do it!!"

But on Monday I have to make arrangements to pay for it or it opens back up to the general public and might get whisked out from under me.  Hmm.  This is good, because it means I have to confirm the date this weekend.  It is intimidating, because it means that I have to talk to my parents very specifically this weekend.  I'm going home for my high school's big rivalry football game, so I guess I'll work it out.  :)

"event","Matt is so great.  :)  He called a bunch of caterers and reception venues this afternoon.  I, on the other hand, took a nap.  :/  I'm really impressed with all the stuff he found out.  :)  I think I might enter some of it in my wedding planner before bed tonight.  We'll see.  It's good to have options.  I talked to Ann today, and she told me to have Gina at the Kress call her if we decide that's where we want to have the reception.  She was so excited for us!  I can't wait to go home and see them and the kids.  :)

I spent awhile this afternoon entering guests into The Knot's guest list organizer.  It's great...once I get everyone's addresses and proper names, etc straightened out, I can print myself a list to use for addressing invitations and stuff.  I think the guest list might be manageable...or I'm forgetting some huge chunk of people we discussed but I didn't write down.  Which is ok, since it's not as though the work I did today is the ultimate and final word.  ;)  It's a good start, though.

Last week I went by a couple of stationers in Chapel Hill.  I think getting invitations engraved or thermographed it ridiculously expensive.  I am leaning strongly toward getting some pretty paper and designing my own.  How fun would that be!  ;)  And it would definitely give Sharon and maybe Kim (if she's interested) something to do to help.  ;)  That's the first thing Sharon mentioned the night I went to show them my ring and gossip.  ;)  Hehehe...yay for pen-and-paper obsessions.  ;)  

Ann made a good point on the phone tonight.  Something she said her brother told her awhile ago, when she was about to marry Bruce.  She said that you don't marry someone because you can live with them, you marry them because you can't live without them.  I can't imagine my life without Matt by my side.  He's a wonderful partner and the love of my life.  :)  

I need contacts for flowers and music.  Ann and I talked about flowers a little tonight, but she and Bruce apparently got married in Canada (which I didn't know!), so I can't really use her florist.  ;)  She said she will talk to her mom, though, and see if she can get any ideas for me.  She also knows another semi-professional photographer.  I am definitely looking forward to asking Frank, but it's so nice to have people sharing contacts with me!  Yay networking.  I could always ask some cousins to play for me.  The Hoyles would be thrilled, I'm sure.  :)  That would be nice.  We'll see...I have some ideas about music, but nothing concrete.  Matt is supposed to be researching DJ's and stuff for the reception, so at least I don't have to worry about that.  *grin*

Wedding planning is so incredibly exciting!  It'd be even better if I could just focus on that, and didn't have school work and house work and bills and stuff to pay attention to.  ;)  Hehehe."

"event","Wedding plans are moving slowly.  We're talking about dates, still.  We'd really like to get married next summer, but there are a few things we need to get taken care of first, so we'll see.  

I called the place where we'd like to have our reception one day this past week.  The lady I talked to was really nice, but she did say that if I wanted to reserve it for one of the dates I asked her about, I needed to do it soon.  Hmm...

I also called Marc Putnam, the pastor at my church in Greensboro.  He was really really nice, as well.  (Not that I expected him to be otherwise.  He's such a great guy!)  He's going to call my parents this week and talk to them, which is good.  

I really want to get this sorted out.  I'm so excited about being engaged, and about wedding planning!  I can't wait to start my life with Matt.  It's the most exciting, wonderful, awesome (and not in the teenager-speak way) thing I've ever done.  Some people, like my parents, think we should wait, but I for one am ready!  :)

This was a hard weekend.  Matt and I both did lots of social stuff, but I think we agree that it would all have been more fun if we had been together.  He went out dancing with his friends in Greenville (something I love to do), and I went to a couple of parties and hung out with mutual high school friends in Chapel Hill.  All of it was great fun, but something was missing.  Oh well.  Hopefully we'll get to see each other soon."

"event","...picking up where I left off...

Although we agreed to start out slowly, I know I realized fairly early on that I loved Matt very much and that we have something special together.  I think Matt was a little more cautious, but it didn't take either one of us too long to realize that this had potential.  ;)

We have weathered a lot of things together, including a two hour distance during the school year, schedules that sometimes don't even give us a chance to say a proper goodnight, much less have a real conversation, and, in the last year, two significant personal losses.  We have supported each other when times are hard, loved a lot, laughed and cried and argued...we have done everything together.  

I don't know when we fell in love, but over the last year or so we have talked more and more about spending forever together.  However, even though we had talked about it more than a little bit, Matt's proposal came as a complete (and wonderful!) surprise to me.  He worked everything out with my wonderful roommate and one of his best friends, Liz, and her boyfriend, Thomas, to whom many thanks are owed.  You guys are awesome!!

Matt came up to Chapel Hill for Labor Day weekend.  When he got here, we ran some errands, including getting groceries to cook pepperoni pizza for dinner.  (My suggestion...apparently I was being subconsciously cooperative and completely oblivious!)  When we got back to my apartment, Liz and Thomas were already back on campus, where they were planning to cook dinner together and watch a movie in Thomas's dorm room...a perfectly normal Friday night activity when Thomas is on duty at 9pm.  I knew they had gone to the video store before they left for campus, so I was surprised to see a DVD and a couple of Liz's textbooks on the kitchen table when Matt and I came in.  They had rented My Best Friend's Wedding (at Matt's request...).  I called Liz, who acted all surprised and disappointed that they'd left their date movie...but since they'd ridden the bus to campus, they ""decided"" not to come back for it and she told me that we could watch it if we wanted to.  (Keep in mind that this was all an elaborate setup.  Matt had asked them to do just what they did, knowing I would call her when I saw the movie there.  They were great.  ;))

So Matt and I made the pizzas (yum!), put in the movie, and collapsed on the couch.  After we finished eating, I laid over with my head in Matt's lap and he started rubbing my shoulders and playing with my hair...a guaranteed way to get me to close my eyes (all part of the plan).  The next thing I knew he had the ring out and he asked me to marry him.  I laughed and almost cried and kissed him and then remembered to say ""YES!""  I was incredibly surprised.  I am usually good at spotting Matt's schemes, but he did a wonderful job on this one.  The whole evening was perfect...it suited us so well.  

We are slowly starting to make plans and gather ideas for our wedding.  We haven't set a date yet, but we're trying to accomplish that by the end of September.  It's a very exciting time, and I know I for one keep having to remind myself to work instead of flipping through bridal magazines or browsing through wedding gowns online.  ;)"

"event","Matt and I met over a pepperoni pizza in the sixth grade (1996).  We became better friends in Spanish class in seventh grade, and in April of 1997 we started dating.  I was 12 and Matt was almost 14.  We survived middle school, a year apart while Matt lived in Wilmington, and more than half of high school together.  We broke up in December of our junior year of high school (2000) and we both dated other people, but we were able to stay good friends.  

Once we started college, we began to talk online more and more often and we started getting really close.  We had dated other people, but by Christmas time we were both single.  We went to see the movie 8Mile on December 18th.  We flirted like crazy and ended up kissing.  We started dating again officially on December 21st, 2002.  :)

"event","It has been a week and a half since Matt proposed.  It's starting to seem real now...less weird and wild and more like the next step in my life.  I'm thrilled.  I have fantastic friends and family who are being wonderfully supportive, too!  

Tomorrow I will update with the story of our engagement and a little about us!  But for now, sleep is calling me.  It was a long and bumpy weekend..."

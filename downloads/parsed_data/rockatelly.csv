"event","So much has been happening. Christmas was pretty great, i got a cell from my baby and a tv from the rents...that was cool. I went to Tennessee for a few days with my cousin and her bf. SO AWESOME! I saw and touched and played with snow.I GOT MY BELLY BUTTON PIERCED!! AHHHHHH...i still can't believe i did it, It was so great. I almost forgot how beautiful it is. I really want to move to North Carolina after i graduate for school(cosmitology...girly i know but its what i like) I'm staying if Johnny won't go because i don't think i could stand leaving him. I love him to much. Johnny went to Canada from the 26th-2nd. Deep down i'm really glad he went because we needed a break from each other for a little bit. It's healthy.....not that i didn't miss him of course!! As of the 28th, we have been together for 1 full year. Wow what a crazy year it has been to. I'm so glad that its a new year time for new things. I want to try to do things differently(please no one say that i can't because it brings me down and then i really can't) anyways i want to try things my way, not anyone elses way. So yeah last night i went to channelside with jamie, amanda, and heather. It was fun. Fireworks and a ball drop and a lot of dancing in the convertible lol. Music, talking, and a night with a girls was definatly great! Happy New Years by the way to everyone. So it was a pretty good break. I'm not ready for school, i know i'm ahead for more hardship and frustration and stress but i guess it has to be done. Alright Johnny comes home really early tomorrow so i'm off to the showers to make myself more perdyful for him! Can't wait! Night all....hope your breaks were great!"

Work has been....ehhhh....ok I cause. I wish I was in the mood that I was in over the summer....all I did was eat sleep work...it was great! Now it's becoming to be a lot of pressure for some reason. I find myself not being able to handle things that I use to....kidna weird. I've been a lot more emotional lately. I was watching a movie the another night called three days...I cried over the stupidest things lol. I mean I seriously cried throughout the whole thing. It was happy tears and sad tears....oy i'm so weird. So yeah Johnny's going away to canada the day after Christmas....i'm so sad. I mean I wouldn't care that he's going, its just he's gonna be gone for out 1 year anniversary thingy. Thats a big deal to me...and he's gonna be gone for new years....sigh...what am I going to do new years eve. I guess a night out with the girls is coming up! I'm happy he gets to see his family though....I know he's looking forward to it...so i'm glad. We've done a lot of christmas shopping but we still arn't done...oy vey so much left to do! I can't believe its almost christmas.....its not the same anymore. Christmas doesn't feel that special to me anymore. I don't know why...kinda scares me. I wish I lived someplace it snowed...I bet it would feel more like Christmas. Alright I gotta go get ready for work soon so i'm gonna go! Later!"

It was great...by the way i have pictures of johnny in my marylyn monroe costume if anyone wants to see...its def a hilarious sight. Then the weekend before me and johnny went to halloween horror nights with his brother STEVIE and his girl Ashenator. It was a lot of fun because we stayed in a hotel with my family(they were there on buisness so we crashed with them to save mula) and it was a good time. We went to city walk as well and we went to go see the grudge and i feel like such a moron because i walked out, but only because i felt so sick and i passed out in the middle of it. I'm scared shitless of that movie....but i am going to go see it again just to get through the whole thing. What a wimp i am hehe. I'll admit it. Well i'm in class right now so i better do what is expected of me and get this magazine i have to do outta the way.....MUCH LOVE!"

I know theres a few of you out there that are like ""you need to spend more time away from him""....but i have to say....no. I love him so much more then you'll ever know. So please stop asking, this is what i want and this is what makes me happy....of course i'm still going to hang out with those who say these things but i'm not just going to give up the best thing that has happened to me all together, thats what you make me feel like.

"event","Well feeling a little better today but not much. Sometimes I think that Johnny doesn't really want to be with me. What really bothers me though, is that his mother despises me to no end. Same with his cousins and brother and aunt. sigh. I never did anything to any of them. I went out of my way to be respectful and nice and always being considerate. I don't understand what I did wrong. Maybe I didn't talk enough, but i'm pretty shy when it comes to holding conversations...I have always been that way. I'm sorry if thats the case. Everything was ok before he left to Greece and now...I can't even go over there because I am so hated. It sucks. All I ever wanted was the mother and father of the person I was dating, to like me. All my friends and their boyfriends parents get along so well. I'm like the outcast. I have never met an adult that hasn't liked me. This is really bugging me if you haven't noticed. Oh well I don't know what I can do about it. But there is no way that I going to let this break me and Johhny apart. He is the most amazing person I have EVER met in my entire life. I will never let him go. He's the most beautiful considerate, warm-hearted person. I love him. He has all of my heart. I guess I am going to go take a nap now...pretty tired....bye for now."

"event","Well today is another one of those days where I hate my life. I honestly hate every single thing except for Johnny and my friends. I would love to just be gone and not have to worry about anything. I always see all these peole that are always happy and have a smile on their face. Then theres people that can be in a group and then leave the group and that person will get the comments "" oh shes so cute and sweet, she always has a good attitude"" then theres people like me who just get damn how miserable can she be. LIfe sucks. I hate me and the person I am. Goodnight."

"event","""Don't take life too seriously, you'll never get out alive""

Yes, a wonderfully brilliant quote from the amazingly spectacular ""National Lampoon's:  Van Wilder.

This to me is the sole ideal for me to live by.  I don't believe worrying will get you anywhere, because all you do is spend your time worrying instead of doing.  I have been thinking lately that I need to start living my life more to it's fullest.

""Knowing is not enough; we must apply.  Willing is not enough; we must do.""

- Bruce Lee

I'm just sitting here late at night wondering of different things I could be doing.  That is one of the reasons I want to travel around the world when I ""grow older.""  It might sound too unrealistic, but my dream was to learn as many languages as I could and just spend my life travelling and learning and sharing experiences.  I've never really come across something that has really reached out and hooked my attention except for things like Philosophy and Kung Fu, things in which deep input and thought are required.  Sometimes I never really know where I am going with ideas I just get up and RUN with them.  A few times it will land me in good places others not so good.  I might be a little too anti social to do so much travelling, but I hope to overcome that.  Just like something miss fischer told me, she said this summer she just got some money together and flew over to Europe.  One night she was standing atop the Eiffel tower and right as the lights began to light up, some stranger grabbed her and said ""i've always wanted a moment on the eiffel tower"" and just gave her a huge kiss.  Stories like that just compel me to go see the world.  Hopefully this year will give me a new perspective on things, so I can go out and just... live.

sorry if my entries bore you.

goodnight."

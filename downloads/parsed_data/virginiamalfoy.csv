"event","I dreamt that I met George Bush last night. It was halfway through an entirely ridiculous dream and one of those dreams that leaves you wondering just how the hell you got to a place in your life that your dream is in any way relevant to your life.

It went something like this.

I can't remember the first part, but I remember walking around with kids from my old class in High School class and sitting down on these metal fold up chairs, when we were told that we were going to meet George Bush Jr. I was kind of confused, because I didn't remember going to Washington DC, and I got a feeling that we were seeing him there(or maybe it was his Texas Ranch, I'm not sure). Anyway, so they picked a small group of us to go in first, and we went through these white French doors and through these big burly looking bodyguards, and there we were in this small, unassuming little dining room like place. George Bush was fiddling with a TV set, as if he was fixing it, and when he looked over he asked us how we were doing, so I told him about the history paper that I'm writing in real life. Then I remember sitting down to dinner, and there was this feeling of impending doom, but all I did was look at the food on my plate. It was lasagna.

end dream.

On a side note, I got new pants and a new skirt. Sw00t."

"event","The first semester of CEGEP came and went with a flurry that both confused my perception of time and space and left me with a fountain of information that I didn't previously think I'd be able to tap into. I learned more than I thought I could in such a short time. Going to CEGEP kind of forced me into a state of maturity that I had once thought I had achieve but had really just kind of hoped myself into. I feel a lot wiser than I was a year ago. My soul has been through a lot since the last New Year, and this New Year proved to be just as full of information to process. 

I don't know exactly how to say it all. I became a better singer, I became a more cynical person, I wrote my first song, and I dealt with the death of a graduate in my class. She died in Cuba, and the details of her death are still just a little fuzzy to me. I haven't quite wrapped my brain around the idea of her death. When I saw her in her casket she didn't look like herself at all. More like an empty container that could have contained anyone, but ended up containing her. Her features were expresssionless, and she wasn't breathing. God, she wasn't breathing at all. There was nothing moving her lungs and there was just no life in her. Her soul had gone to another place, and it was so sad. The room was filled with this tragedy that shooke veryone no matter how little they knew her or how   much. The intensity varied, but it was still there, and it was still sad. It shook me into a startled contemplative moroseness. I didn't know what to do with myself. What does one do with the news of someone's death? Nothing. You can't do anything. Not a fucking thing.

It's been a month since she died and since that month I've found myself, once again, contemplating her. More like contemplating life. When I went back to Ottawa the most significant thing that happened was seeing Jordan. I thought that maybe, just maybe I was tricking myself into this almost mythical attraction I had to him before I went, and when I was there I could see that it wasn't mythical and that he was real and that I just didn't want to be away from him. That whole love makes you do crazy things made me wonder just how crazy I could be with those.... thoughts running through my head. It's been almost exactly a week since I saw him and I haven't thought about much else. 

I wrote a poem.

<b>Almost Cherubic</b>
My skin is pale like forgotten
a surreptitious reminder of the glass case incidence
blood boycotting my body
abolitionists in sarcasm's clothing
peel at the swordstrokes and the skin is all the same,

Solemn and sacrificial

Sounds are limitless and words are cheap
your voice on the phone makes my heart squeeze cellophane
trembling into my fingers
it's arbitrary and lilting
purring into my ear, a carborator censure,

skeletal figures dance in my eyelids
hollow eyed incubus steal their way to unimportance
vacant thresholds wait for the morning
the tears haven't stopped.
I've been holding out until my form can curl into yours,

War tactics
                     battle fortress
                                               - Of hopeless solitude

It's almost cherubic
just a little heathenistic

Self degrading sense of preservation
warning labels
too close might hurt, my darling
feign magesterial grace and the world might follow
                                                 stepping in line
successive to grace
swagger like alcohol so you can leave a scar
was that your plan all along?

Unused and self involved
encased in the sound of my trepidation
paper-thin membranes stretched thin to fit sickly flesh
paved like New York City
your breath leave the foggiest marks on my frame
I trace them feebly

The hum that drowns your dreams in information
It tastes like death in my mouth but I stay for the view

48 timelines -binary one's and zero's probing polygonal crevices
                                It's lascivious and high-maintenance
shrieking to a sigh
                    softer, so depressive
lemon yellow stucco walls hold disconnects like framework
wallowing is commonplace
delusional is where I want to be."

Buy her CD ""My Favorite Distraction""

It's genius.

<b>Idiotsyncracies</b> By Coral Egan.

<i>There seem to be so many reasons to fight with tooth and nail
Chosee your battle change it's name to suit your warriors chain and mail
Could it be you just need an outlet, or are these causes truly yours?
You may find peace of mind of the Prozac kind
better brace yourself for a long dark journey inside
Now you're wading through distraction
How tempting to remain
But the vapid nature of it's purpose emits an intolerable dull pain
Your head dives right in and your suol is left alone to fend
for itself again in this huge playpen
while the rest of you jumps and sways to illusion

And you take it so hard when you're not that strong
and you seem to get bored when there's nothing wrong
do you keep the turmoil up or just let it simmer?
There's a richness of darkness with leisure yes
all this time to work hard but still you regress
you're an idiotsyncracy at best

your soul sits cross legged, your chin upon your hand
contemplating your surroundings for the first time in ages
don't it just get you off your butt to start playing in the sand again
Because all this time you've been on the grind
You've been missing out on the action
Idiotsyncracies.</i>"

"event","Tired. No energy. Posting Pointless lines from 20 playlist songs. The game is trying to figure out what the lines from the songs are, but it's just to occupy my tired brain.


1.Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas, fish full of mercury.
2.I speak to you in riddles 'Cause my words get in my way. 
3.Don't you tell me to deny, I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins.
4.A warning sign. It came back to haunt me, and I realised That you were an island and I passed you by.
5.I can't face this world that's keeping us apart 
6.Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
7.He drowns in his dreams, an exquisite extreme I know. He's a damned as he seems, and more heaven than a heart could hold.
8.Here I stand, 6 feet small,and smiling cause I'm scared as hell
9.Take these sunken eyes and learn to see.
10.When she talks she moves her mouth instead of her lips.
11.Did you know that true love asks for nothing? her acceptance is the way we pay. Did you know that life has love a guarantee to last through forever and another day?
12.I only know what I've been working for, another you so I can love you more.
13.You'll never reach the end of the road while you're travelling with me
14.Into the sea of waking dreams I follow without pride
15.You got something that you want me to sell
16.Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
17.A friend once said, and I found to be true. That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?
18.I can see it in your eyes you still despise the same old lines you heard the night before. 
19. I've drawn a conclusion, it's all an illusion, confusion's the name of the
game. A misconception, a vast deception, Something's gotta change.
20.It's been a long long time since I look into the mirror. I guesss I was bling, now my reflections getting clearer.

Tired doesn't measure up to the feeling I feel right now. So. Much. Work. I have just about a billion palcement tests for Vanier and on top of it I have a concert next week, two tests this week, a slew of log entries for Othello, and Box Office duty during the weekend.

AAAAAAAAAAH!"

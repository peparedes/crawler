"event","An unmistakable sign of paranoia is continual mistrust.

People with paranoid personality disorder are constantly on their guard because they see the world as a threatening place. They tend to confirm their expectations by latching on to any speck of evidence that supports their suspicions and ignore or misinterpret any evidence to the contrary.

Because persons with paranoid personality disorder are hyperalert, they notice any slight and may take offense where none is intended. As a result, they tend to be defensive and antagonistic. 

They are highly critical of others. 

 They pride themselves on their rationality and objectivity. People with a paranoid outlook on life rarely come to the attention of clinicians -- it is not in their nature to seek help. Many presumably function competently in society. 

They may seek out social niches

 in which a moralistic and punitive style is acceptable
or at least tolerated to a certain degree.

Another theme seen frequently is that of delusional jealousy.
Individuals with somatic delusions are convinced that there is something very wrong with their bodies -- that they emit foul odors, have bugs crawling in or on their bodies, or are misshapen and ugly.
 Because of these delusions, they tend to avoid the society of other people and spend much time consulting physicians for their imagined condition."

"event","so this day,fabulus day that it is for some, while so sad for many others, i lived it, year 19. went to bed at 2 30, woke up at 6 drove over 2 hrs, took soc test, went to bed at 1130 woke up at 349, went to  1 of 3 classes today , went to practce, walked the city, drank alone, took sleeping pills and plan to pas s out early,.


i dont care though, i didnt try to do anything this is the second best option i had. and still i love it

filll your mind with chocolate and pnk and red and flowers and love and beauty and all that wnderful feeling (when i read thi s i will most likely delete it. 


whaever right now i fee good and all
\\\


not going to be overly gushingg with emotions, but placing some lyrces, surely over used, gay and non creative


Racing thru' my brain And I just can't contain This feeling that remains There she blows 
There she blows again 
Pulsing thru' my vein And I just can't contain This feeling that remains There she goes, there she goes again 
She calls my name, pulls my train 
No-one else can heal my pain And I just can't contain This feeling that remains There she goes 
There she goes again 
Chasing down my lane And I just can't contain This feeling that remains




aawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
xox


chill the mind, let it be

oka so afternoon classes are canceled because of snow which is so great because i have a huge anatomy test i am not prepared for and need to study for.

also i have so much homework that i should do but dont wanna.. but can CUZ I HAVE SO MuCH FREE TIME TODay yES!


this semester is a lot of difficult work so far, i dont like work.


i wanna go buy more socks instead of doing laundry....


i  need a hair cut and may do that today



so a fact of life is that weed brings people together. it is the easiest way of making friends. although i do not smoke these days it is still how i first make some sorta bond (not really the right word) with people. i am aware that this is sad but still it works.

every guy i am friends/sorta almost friends with potential to become one is a pot head. and i love this, but at the same time it could kinda take away from something more genuine? what ever i do not care


i went off some of the pills i was on for like the past 5 days.... and they were the i guess most important/highest dosage ones (1600 mg). i feel sorta the same i guess, but i dont think the were totally working right either. 



should i attempt living on less psychologically enhancing prescriptions, start taking these again so i dont like end up going crazy and having a mental breakdown, or start taking something similar but different from those that potentially will be more effective and improve my out of control mind????

feedback/advice is more then encouraged cz i dont really know what ta do



this is a big decision"

i dont have much to write. i am now a NU student, before i wasnt.

i dont spend much time there and when i do im wishing i was somewhere else. itsw relly not at all bad though, i like people which is a shocker. 

ummm so yeah right now im not at school.

i skipped class friday,a nd now i will be doing so for monday. lets call it a long weekend. its better to not be in class. once i miss three i start losing credit, so after omorow i will have one in each class. its like im not behind  yet, bubt i feel it coming really soon. i freak out about the work and then ill go to natick or something, and then like still wont do the work. so i am learning it is a bigger waste of time to have abreak down over shit, that im not goign to do no matter what, so why the fuck should i bother to care? whoa ramble...

i am at wesleyan. i was at NU for the weekend and came here earlier today. i want to count how many times i have left to come here or go home or anywhere. i gotta get into the actual college thing.. being staying there for more then 3 days at a time.


-+-+-+-+-+-.....thats my heads ups and downs (but actuallly iw as just playing with the keys doing a pattern, and saw what i did and was like oh okay yeah blah blah)



ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm well i am staying here,  and i didnt do any homework over the weekend or last week, and didnt bring any with me to do here.. so yeah this is all the writing i will be doing tonight



live journal is sooooooo stupid


i lookeed back and i had liek wrote so many things that were stupid while i was drunka nd then had gone back and written something else cause the stupid drunk shit annoyed me.

okay thats enough

 this isnt a bad thing, but when i became friends with everyone many years ago it was a group of happy straight people. it slowly turned into a group of  generally gay (bi w/e), overall depressed, alcohol/drug abusers. do these things normally come with age, or is everyones actions and life choices contagious to one another?

there isnt much more to be said about that, just throwing it out there..

"event","friday: had friends over. the scum of the school decide to show up for a big party. i ask them to leave so they steal a trophy and smash it on the street, and kick my car. 

saturday: went out early in the ngiht then came back at 9 to see what was going on. nothing was. we go to my house and drink THIRTY SEVEN year old whiskey and all sorts a weird shit. e lee came over late and that was fun.  umm ok so then chill and whatever for hours. Then it is 2 in the moring and yet again is time for a mc donalds run. Our luck with mcdonalds in the middle of the night has never been good...

so yeah we go ona crazy back illegal acess road and we can not find our way to the front of the place. so lindsay tells aklian to go down this road that says DO NOT ENTER WRONG WAY WRONG WAY ONE WAY. like 5 signs.. i say dont.. but we do... we start going onto the mass pike in the WRONG DIRECTION at 2 am. kaitlan does not know how to go in reverse so we are doing a like a 12 point turn on this one way road ten feet from the mass pike. yeah cars come flying onto this road at 60 mph all the time. getting hit i think would have been death. SO THAT WAS REALLLY FUN! i was so so scared and conviced we were going to be smashed by an 18 wheeler or something.

but we werent so all was good and after another 10 minuets of driving over cones and down more one way roads and shit we find the front. 

Chris gets out of the car runs into the bathroom and vomits into a urinal. then doesnt knwo where we are so walk s like a really far distance to a dunkin donuts thinking wee are there, but we arent we are in the place he was puking. ok so he eventually finds us we sit for a while and eventually go home and we end another dramatic night. 



sunday: wake up at 2. go out searching for anythinging to do. eventually i call matt and we go to the mall to get hoodies and stuff. it was along time since i was there and i havnet gone into any of the new stores. so we go into the new abercrombie (i know its been like that for like a year)and then to hollister. i was shocked disgusted and disturbed. thats just wrong in so many ways. ok so thats that.

back to school for four days, then five, then hopefully i will never go into natick high again"

i was doing some reading and this struck me as interesting:

     It's commonly thought that teen depression can lead to cigarette smoking, but a new study, published in the 
     October edition of Pediatrics, shows it's the smoking that increases the risk of depression. 

     ""Cigarette use is a powerful determinant of developing high depressive symptoms,"" says Elizabeth Goodman, 
     M.D., associate professor of pediatrics in the division of Adolescent Medicine at Children's Hospital Medical 
     Center of Cincinnati and lead author of the study. ""In fact, nondepressed teens who smoke face approximately a 
     four times greater risk of developing depression than non-smoking teens."" 

     Smoking's effect on the development of depression may be attributable to central nervous system effects of 
     nicotine or other smoking by-products, according to Dr. Goodman. ""The effectiveness of antidepressants in 
     smoking cessation, independent of previous or current depression, provide additional support for this view,"" she 
     says. 

     While heavy cigarette use is not necessarily a result of depression, Dr. Goodman's study shows that other social 
     factors do predict progression to heavy smoking. These include previous experimentation with tobacco products, 
     poor school performance, peer tobacco use, more frequent use of alcohol, and parental report of bad temper. 

     For healthcare providers, the study highlights the importance of providing ""anticipatory guidance"" regarding 
     psychosocial functioning and tobacco use to teenagers, according to Dr. Goodman, and of encouraging 
     adolescents to stop smoking. ""The findings of this study suggest that problem behavior, physical dependence, and 
     social influence all impact on the progression to heavy smoking in adolescents,"" she says.

NEATO.


on a seperate note i am sick with bronchitis  and a sinus infection. it came on fairly unexpected, i woke up sunday and felt awful, figuring it was just the repercussions of a rough weekend.  Then it developed and blah here i am with all sorts of meds and an inhalor. my apoligies if you catch anything.

it just made me think and i sorta liked it. its extremly negative but hey most things are.

"event","The first part of saturday night: Had 'party' sketchy people were there, it wasnt all taht fun, people were being mean to one another, i asked some peopel to leave. Your average saturday. 


The later part of my saturday night:

It was about three in the morning when chris and i decided its time to go to mcdonalds. The only 24 hr mcdonalds we know is in framingham. There are about 50 cars there all trying to go through the drive through, all pimped up (for lack of a better phrase)  mustanges and hondas and stuff. The car infront of us bumps the other ever so slightly by mistake. With in two minuets there are 30 puerto rican guys, and there slutty girlfriends all beating the shit out of each other. I would love to drive away but i am stuck between curbs, bushes,  and cars in the drive through line. We are sitting there scared a stray bullet will soon be killing us, when we see the manager looking out on the phone, obviously calling the police.  Before the police get there they start smashing up this one guys car and wont let him get food and make him drive aay while kiking and denting his car.

So chris and I, completly terrified are trapped there when like three police cars come flying in. We have drugs in the car, and though i was fine to drive was probably legally drunk. But so the cops are there and all theese cars go peeling out of the parking lot. We stay cause all the scary people are gone. So finally we pull out of the parking lot, and yup a cop follows us for about a half a mile. (note: i am 17 so if they pull me over for any reason i am fucked.) So i turn down the mall road and he stops following me. 

I really have not been so scared in a while. between the fear of being shot, and/or arrested i almost had a heart attach. 

So yeah how was everyone elses saturday?"

"event","parents need to understand that at this point in our lives it is over. there time of having any power or influence on our decisions is done. We are all nearly or already legal adults.

All the parents out theere are very sad, that are talking about how bad there kids frriends are. As a general rule.. if your kids friends are bad, they are too. Dont blame it on someone else except that your child is a fuck up, not just those kids they hang out with. 

People typically end up with others who are similar to them. They often share the same interests and activities.  There is always a reason groups form together the way they do. 

try thinking about that.

p.s. i am positive that at least one parent who is snooping through there childs computer, looking for who they talk to, or trying to find something out about there life that does not really concern them will read this. Guarantee"

"event","My fortune cookie said, "" Your destiny lies before you, choose wisely."" this bothered me on a number of levels. 


Lately when i try to go to sleep im stuck in that weird half awake/half dreaming state, then i wake up completly and it feel all confused and weird. 
Also, and im not sure what this is a consequence of, i can no longer keep memories seperated, they all blur together. Thing that happen months apart,but like i remebr them as the same night. And, i have been confusiing stories that that like have happened on tv or to other people i know and thinking they are my own or my friends or something. And dreams and reality are starting to run together, many mornings i'll wake up and call someone to see if what im thinking of actually happened or if i created. so yeah this kinda sucks my memory shouldnt already be cutting out.

Oh yeah, i ws watching food network and they were talking about herbs, and it bothered me because i cant imagine how thyme smells. this bothered me for like a good 20 mins.


school is starting to bother me so much. I wish i had gone on friday, it was stupid to skip it. wwhatever no changing the past

im so close to being done, but so worried im not going to make it at the same time. i cant fail anything or else i wont get the internship. Its going to be close


i slept 3 hours last night, and only  like 5 ish friday. im gonna take a bunch of unisome and pass out soon to make up for it. (those things are magic)"

"event","This weekend was surprisingly fun. I would have thought that i would despise hanging out with every kid in my grade, but i actually had a great time both nights. It entertained me when a number of seperate indivuals who i hardly know would see me in the hall and smile and go meredittttth or haha you were funny. I am pretty sure this means i made a complete ass out of myself and got a few laughs, but hey, thats alright, no one seemed negative about it. 
it was a definite good way to end my 2 week drug/alcohol binge. you gotta finish witha bang right? 
today was my first day of track, and my return to sobriety. I have mixed feelings. Its nice to be active again, its crazy how fast my body will start to feel healthy again after a couple of weeks of abuse. Honestly, i ran like a mile and felt like the healthiest person alive. I hope i can bounce back that fast at least into my late twenties.

ummm what else i gotta say? 

oh yeah march 17 is both st patricks day and my two year aniversary for my tongue ring. To celebrate the day i feel it is time for a new piercing.. but i cant think of something to get, i am happy to take suggestions if you can think of any.


and some lyrics (read them they are good) and i can relate to them

All these people they won't leave me alone
And we need a little time to ourselves
And half the reasons why I'm sketchin' all the time
The result of this life in hell
But oh well, I think its time 

-skip-

My mind is playing tricks on me all the time
To let you know that I am real
And all the worries you build up inside your soul
The ones that make your world stand still
....Mean you can feel 
That its time to go 


skip

I laugh and slip into another state of mind
To let you know that I am real
And all the worries you build up inside your soul
The ones that make your world stand still, mean you can feel 
That its time to go 



OK yes i havent decided yet but i want some part of this song written on my grave. Not that im going to die any time soon, i mean in the distant distant future, ive got plenty of time left on this earth.

PS my blind melon lighter has not come,, and im freaking out, but my dvd did come, which is good."

"event","so many people fucking suck. just suck. why? i dont know, ask them.

secondly: if you are putting on a front liek you want to fulfill an image or want a certain persona attached to you, and are acting to try and fit it... everyone knows you are posing and makes fun of you behind your back. ( i dont have a specific person in mind this is to all the retarded people in the world)

thirdly: if you have drama all the time.. shut the fuck up about it! no one cares.. if they  act like they do they are just being polite.. in truth, they are complaining about your complaining.. and then eveything just gets confusing

and a final note: no i dont have a final note anymore ten minuets have passed because ive been talking to peopel online and i forgot what i was mad about. but i was mad about something ant some point.. and was trying to make a point. so remebr that!!

and should you tell someone when they are annoying and retarded? or shrug it off then discuss it later and  have a chuckle? good question. personally i wil do neither and get mad about it to myself, or laugh it off... depending how mentally stable i am at the time

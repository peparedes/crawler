i am in a very intresting mood today and i dont really know what that mood is. i really dont have any feelings either. but today was so nice out!!!!! We got to o out side for gym and it was so hot!!!! But its ok cuz i had shorts!! Anyway i am very happy about one thing. it is about dance (what eles woould it be about?)I usually take one privite lesson every year...so that means i can do one solo.and this i asked my mom if i could take two and she said no the whole time until i asked my dad and he said i dont care:) so thats one good thing and the next good thing is that I have two kids signed up to take privite lessons with me!! i wasnt originally on the list to teach privite lessons but some parents requested me for there kids so thats a good thing also. i will get paid $10 for a 30 min. lesson.
so that will pay for the second lesson that i am taking that i have to pay for.

The next good thing is that i get to do a duet with Dani this year also!!!! My mom first said that i could only do it if i gave up one of my privites but i talked her in to letting me do all of them. so im excited we r gona do a lyrical to ""truley madly,deeply""

And another thing i need u guys to  think of a song i should do for my second solo it is gona be a jazz/ character. and for my lyrical song in either gona do ""im lost without you"" or that one song form goo goo dolls...ashley u know which one!
well i better be going see ya later

Trisha rolled up in her friend kathleens daddys car. I meet everybody Kathleen, Justin, and Trisha! I shake their hands and I look at trisha then she punches the side of my head! haha we go to Providence and it's the raddest place on earth. I think it even tops harvard square. We're just walking uphill alot, i saw a greenhouse but we couldnt go in. saw paris hilton. i talked to this spanish vender in spanish then we went to this pizza place, it was ill. annoying skateboarders. we laughed at them and the chick with the g-string and got confused by the reversible mirror. played atari in urban outfitters and tried to get butterfingers at the record shop. we went to a park saw ice skaters and we chilled under a gooch. then we went to the mall and split up and got lost and played in KB and trisha got de ja vou in newbury comics. we went back to the park and chilled with a drunk guy and Trisha and I fought a little bit. chilled for a while then I had to get dropped off at the shaws. i wish they couldve chilled longer but its alright though. I killed an hour by reading in office max, kmart and getting a schedule in shaws. Kathleen and Justin are really nice people, theyre rad. Trisha is amazing. lyk i really really really like her. shes the best! <33

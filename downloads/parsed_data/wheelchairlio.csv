I've been having health problems that would not suprise you in the least bit.
Things typical of being of what I am being in which I have found, well. You'll see.
What I'd like to do is take some time off to talk about a personal drama that has been unfolding.

I am WHEELCHAIR bound.


Out and about in my day to day lifes I am called upon to do sometimes unusual things to preserve some kind of normalcy in my life, normalcy you may all take for granted. One such time I was in a bathroom at JAMBA JUICE here in NY CITY while not normally a place I go it was my understanding that they now do make some smoothies with a SPLENDA.  I started to hear a familiar HISS and knowing that I had released it was my duty to find the malfunction of my, toilet tube, in lay mans terms. Whilst in this bathroom I became tangled as my squeezebulb twisted in my winter (it twas January at the time) wheels. I began to curse the HEAVENS when I was sent an angel! I was nervous  as at first glance standing in front of a bright florescent light all I could see was a medium length bob haircut and a slight frame, putting me at once in the mind of a female tennis pro or the like but then as my pupils adjusted and the frustration that was blinding me began to wane as my toilet angel began to speak in a low soothing tone.  When my eyes fully focused I realized it was none other than <b>ORLANDO BLOOM </b> that had come to my rescue.  He patiently unwound my release bag like a pro! He must have some kind nurse training before as the normal gush that happens when there is a kink didn't phase him at all!  When he was done untangling me he used a damp paper towel to wipe down my face then after that parts of my chair.  He stood and I sat in silence as he cared for me... I glanced up and noticed he had slight smile on his face, not unlike the smile of Legolas!  Finally he broke the long silence and asked ""How long have you had this wheelchair"" I answered him that it had been at least 12 years but it was comfortable and suited me (it has a sticker that says 'if you don't like the way I drive stay off the sidewalk' which is very funny on a wheelchair and garners much amuesment from people) then he went on to tell me about various upgrades to my release system that can be made and how squeeze bulbs aren't used much anymore. He seemed to be very learned on the subject as if he had been a salesman or friendly (and quite intimate, not in a sexual way that I know of, I mean, I can't say really) with chair users before.  He said the upgrades were expensive and asked my name.  Reaching into his manpurse he pulled out his checkbook and right there ON THE SPOT wrote me a check for 2400.00 dollars! I was flabbergasted.  I had no idea what to say or do.  I sputtered ""Thank You"" as the tears welled up in my eyes, his as well... a single tear fell from his eye, dripping on my arm.  While that alarmed me as body fluids are an easy way to catch many dangerous bugs and my immune system being very low because of my situation (WHEELCHAIR) I was still touched. Not literally, well, I guess maybe literally... but mostly touched in my heart.

I actually used the money not on repairing my chair but to go to Epcot center.  I had a BLAST! WOW!

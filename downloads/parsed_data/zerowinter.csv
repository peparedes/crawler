"event","<strong><u>Restaurant Review - VS<br /></u></strong>Ryde<br /><br /><strong>Verdict: </strong>Sorry folks, this litlte gem is strictly friends only!<br /><br /><strong>Ambience 10\10</strong><br />This little home is safetly hidden from the industrial city by luscious, leafy tree's. Boasting warm colours, comfy sofa's and lounge chairs, beautifully emotive enlarged photos, quirky bumper stickers and cups shaped to topple over, this is the type of haven where you feel a real sense of ""home"".&nbsp; The gourmet chefs and inviting and kindly share with guests stories of their life and interesting musings from the wider world.&nbsp; <br /><strong><br />Food 10/10<br /></strong>Our night began with a healthy serving of juicy prawns dusted in a salt and pepper seasoning. One of our lovely hosts said they'd borrowed this recipe from her Dad and you can tell why - juicy and full of flavour, i would have stolen this recipe from my dad too! After indulging in prawns the main course came out - mini fahijtas, a mix of stir fried veges with chicken, chicken in a spicy marinade or beef, gaucamole and a home made relish. The little mini pockets were fantastic as they allowed us to sample all the foods on the table although for me it was certainly one of those meals where you can't help but go back for more even after you're full, just because it all tastes so good. The preparation of dessert was an interesting affair as our hosts and chefs brought out a little flame torch and began to set the creme brulee's they had decoratively prepared. After a satisfying crack of the hardened sugar, one could dig deep into the yoghurt and find raspberrys below, a decadent way to finish of a royal feast.<br /><br /><strong>Value 10/10<br /></strong>This is the type of nice you just can't put a price on. Thanks guys for such a top night, and inviting us into your beautiful home :)"

"event","<strong><u>Restaurant Review - The New Orleans Cafe<br /></u></strong>Cnr Pacific Hwy &amp; Willoughby Rd, Crows Nest<br /><br />We were looking forward to going to this cafe after driving past it many times and seeing it quiet busy, and having heard good reviews from a few years back.<br /><br /><strong>Verdict: </strong>Don't even bother going.<br /><br /><strong>Ambience 4\10</strong><br />The restaurant is set on the corner of two busy streets and also features a nice outdoor area, however is very noisy around eating times. Just wooden tables and chairs, painted walls.At least the chairs were comfy.<br /><strong><br />Food 2/10<br /></strong>James had the buffalo wings and we decided to get a larger portion of the Chicken and Chorizo Gumbo to share. James' buffalo wings came out and I have to say they looked pretty manky like old crispy skin - he said they pretty much tasted the same - they were extremely dry, tasteless, like they were a few days old. The gumbo came out and although it was a large protion, it consisted of predominately thick gravy and probabl five small cubes of chicken and a few slithers of chorizo (if you could call it that - it wasn't spicy at all, tasted more like greasy, old salami), the gravy was exceedingly tasteless although it was tasty enough to leave a foul taste in both our mouths. Even the small amount of rice didnt seem quiet right - like it had been prepared yesterday and reheated - it was kinda dry and crunchy<br /><br /><strong>Service 6/10<br /></strong>I'm suprised that our orders even came out correctly and quickly, as we were served by probably 5 different wait staff, none of which wrote anything down. <br /><br /><strong>Value 1/10<br /></strong>For a glass of water, a coke, the large gumbo and the buffalo wings we left for just over $30. We left the restaurant feeling like&nbsp;we had been cheated (most of our meals were in the plate) and felt like we needed to go eat something else to restore our faith in food-kind. The only reason why this place is getting a 1 in terms of value is because of the portion sizes -&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;it was a lousy experience&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Well here we are at April already, life just seems to be going by faster and faster -&nbsp; its so cliche yet so true that one should enjoy their youth as they have it, and that when you're young you really do have all the time in the world. that's not to say i'm not having a good time, i am, but everything just seems to be moving too fast.&nbsp;<br />i did find some time to sit back and just *breathe* earlier this week though. it was night time and i put an old cd on and listened to it in the dark. when i was in highschool, the last thing i used to do before falling asleep was listening to music. it was nice to revert back to an old action and listen to some lost tunes as it brought back alot of memories and gave me an opportunity to look towards the future as well. i dont really know whats going to happen day to day, but if i try and stick to my own beliefs and widen my perceptions then hopefully all will be ok.<br /><br />Well one of the owners of the business, Kerry,&nbsp;was down last week to guide me and check up on the store etc. On the whole, Kerry and Kim (her husband and also co-owner who also came down but spent his time running errands) seemed pretty happy with the way the store was looking. There were some processes I wasnt really sure on that I now am clearer on and I learnt alot about the products from her. It was also really nice to hear her talk and&nbsp; handle the customers as there's always something extra to learn there too. We have some pretty awesome customers coming in on a regular basis and some very interesting people out there. There was a lady who had a lung transplant - she was possibly about 55 or so and was looking so fit, there is another lady who comes in every Friday for her regular dosage of tea and is always cheery, the elderly couple where the lady reminds me of a kinder version of my north shore grandfather and her husband is a retired podiatrist and its very funny to watch them go around and she fusses over all the tea pots and he has to gentle remind her that she already has enough. They're also pretty willing to try new things and even let me make up a blend for them. There's also the folks over at Jimini's, the fantastic little cafe that also has some of our teas for people to drink and all the staff there are lovely and young and it's interesting to see and here what plans they have for their life. These are the nice things that have been filling my very long days at work.<br /><br />I try and cook a few times a week at home as well and I am enjoying spending time with my puppies and parents. When Friday comes though it's so exhilerating to be back with my James, although Friday night I conk out pretty bad :) He has been kind and up to this week I havent really had to study, could just rest and watch tv while he studies, but this weekend i know i have to pull my finger out and start back up again, or i won't ever finish my degree. Both our parents are going up to Orange tomorrow for Easter, so we get to spend the next few days together. Tomorrow we are going to do some study and walk the puppies, on Easter Sunday we will walk again and then we have got tickets for Goldclass Cinema to see The 300, and following this we are going to see our friends an watch the rugby together. My ex-boss and his girlfriend gave birth to their baby girl on Sunday, she weighed in at 2.5 kilos and they have called her Alexanne or Xan for short, so it will be time to visit the little one soon.<br /><br />My cousins and aunty made an unexpected trip down to Sydney too, the eldest is recently out of juvenile detention. He is fifteen and has been doing alot of drugs and landed in hospital a few times, his younger brother is against it all&nbsp;yet does some pretty crazy jackass style stunts and i wonder what is going on in his head and i think he is often forgotten being in the middle, the youngest is only 6 and thankfully still young enough to be in her own little world. While they were down I took the boy to the movies and spent some time with them. I'm not sure when I will see them again but I hope they...I suppose I hope they think a little more about their own decisions. It's hard, sometimes I think at that age its all about just riding the wave.<br /><br />Mum goes in to hospital on Wednesday for her operation. I know she is scared but I hope we can help her relax when she realises we are there to help her recouperate. I know the puppies will be happy to have a friend home with them all day and someone they can sook over :) We also have a new computer as Dad will be working from home for two weeks after Mum comes home, we're in the process of getting a new and faster internet connection so you might just be hearing a bit more from me now<br /><br />Well, I spose that's everything in a nutshell for now, I hope you all have a most enjoyable long weekend where-ever you are x</p>"

"event","<p>what a week. </p><p>it's so nice to finish off my week with a shorter day on Friday and then getting to drive over to see James for the first time all week. It means that no matter how bad my week has been until then, all the stress melts away and the rest of the week is ended on a nice note. I'm at that point now, so in retrospect, my week hasnt seemed that bad.</p><p>I officially took over on Wednesday at the tea store. we had a nice dinner out with the team (and extended team - there is a cafe in the centre that makes our teas, they're all lovely and the cafe itself would have to be my favourite in sydey, theyre always busy which is greay advertising for us too anyway- some of the girls from the cafe came too as we have become friends with them) and our newest member Yurika came along too.&nbsp;She started on Monday and although I think she is going to turn out great for the business and come to be a friend too, I&nbsp;forgot how much time and effort it took&nbsp;to train someone up. On Wednesday night we had stocktake, and one of the guys who manages one of the other shops and who came and worked at&nbsp;my store a bit&nbsp;over christmas, came to help out. he (david) is a lovely fellow, probably as old as my parents and from england. he's writing a book about his grandfther and used to go out clubbing up until about 5 or so years ago just for t he love of the music (not the lifestyle), but is also a heavily dedicated family person, so it's sort of like a responsible adult who loves to dance&nbsp;person. anyway, it was lovely to have him there.&nbsp;david was originally going to take&nbsp;my store but because of a series of events, he ended up staying as manager&nbsp;one of the other stores. we didnt get out until 1030 that night as we had to weight&nbsp;all the tea and count everything. my previous boss was fantastic and i really value her friendship but i have found her managing style really disorganized, so its been hard trying to re-organise things and do the stock take, because everything is everywhere. david also gave me some fantastic tips for the store and we will probably also swap stores every now and then to&nbsp;keep it interesting, and as i get my car serviced near his store so it would be a&nbsp;good conveniant swap. &nbsp;&nbsp;so after that late night came thursday and staying back late as yurika isnt quiet ready to be left on her own yet, and it was awhile between when i finished and when the next staff member came. afterwards i decided to treat myself to a massage as lots of standing + insomnia + lots going on at work and all = me scatterbrain and in need of relaxation. although it&nbsp;the massage itself was relaxing, i left really really angry and peeved off with&nbsp;some of the human race. basically these idiots came in and created a huge racus ""i want someone really good, dont try and rip me off with one of your illegal workers. i know what acupressure is all about. i want some one good. i want&nbsp;someone who can work my meridians because i have a liver problem"" etc etc fucking on and on and really loud. then two men came out to do the massage and the two guys&nbsp; (who i am assuming were drunk&nbsp;or at least&nbsp;hoping they were because it would somewhat partially excuse their fucking miserable behaviour) and they are still talking really loudly then one of them ""i have to go to the toilet, do you have a can? you know, i have to take a piss"" etc and&nbsp;then the other one was trying to catch the other masseuse out on his english (thankfully the two men who were serving the idiots could speak reasonable english). not long after they both start getting their massage one of them says really loudly ""oh man thats really good, you're giving me a hard on"" and then i would hear intermittently all they sexual sounding groans.&nbsp;it was really&nbsp;discgraceful and i made sure to apologise to the girl at the counter for their pitiful and rude behaviour, and sadly she said that they get people like that all the time. Honestly folks, where do people get off??&nbsp;<br />so that brings me to today which was a good day, although i am still&nbsp;adding up the amounts we scribbled down for stocktake, and will have to work on it over the weekend.<br /><br />my mum has to go in for surgery&nbsp;in april&nbsp;and&nbsp;has to take 6 wks off to recouperate so i think things at home are a little tense as we try and work it all out. my dad isnt very happy about her going in but i think he realises its something&nbsp;she has to do, and is&nbsp;really worried, but he just bottles it all up, and additionally he has been having a hard time at work too. mum&nbsp;is also worried about the operation and i think about her work as they really need to start&nbsp;trainings omeone up to take over her&nbsp;role now, otherwise they will probably&nbsp;keep&nbsp;calling her up all the time, but her&nbsp;boss is in hospital with heart problems too. Added to&nbsp;things being a bit tense between her and dad because of a lack of communication so i'm trying to make like of it all for them. i'm looking forward to cooking every night and getting their lunches etc&nbsp;together as&nbsp;i would like to change their diet a little to include more fish, and one vegetarian meal a week, but i am not looking forward to the cleaning the house and managing work at the same time.&nbsp;at the same time, james parents are also going away for six weeks which was&nbsp;unfortunate timing and so&nbsp;i will need to look after james and make sure he is eating also as he has exams and cant take the time out to cook etc, we recently discovered he suffers from anxiety and although i know its&nbsp;something we can all work towards, i think it is something that is worrying and upsetting me because i want to be there for him too, especially as his parents will be away and he may get lonely but i also have my mum to look out for. so its going to be one huge juggling act between mum, james and work. i spoke to my brother who seemed really down but i sent him up some tea's to help with his detox, so i hope it brings a little smile to his face, and ill try to call him more often to check on him as well. he has decided to just take another 3 months and visit all the states so that he can officially finishe his ""around australia""&nbsp;dream and move on with his life. he had some crazy days at work where he was doing night day shifts with 4 hours sleep inbetween, and now its gone the other way and theres barely enough work to cover him a week, which is making it hard for him to save and i think subsequently getting him down. but i think mostly because some of the things he had hoped that his trip would answer, never got answered as the trip sure didnt turn out how he expected and he feels he still doesnt have those answers, so he doesnt know what he will do when the trip is finally over.<br /><br />so although it may sound all a bit dramatic at the moment, im really feeling quiet good at the moment. its the end of the working week and i have two whole days ahead with my james and i know its just going to be delightful.<br /><br />wishin you all well <strong>x</strong></p>"

"event","sorry its been awhile.
a brief update
our holiday has been and gone. it was nice to get away and spend some time with j, which was the most important thing about going. that said, we didnt really like coffs harbour at all and the place that we stayed at was a bit of a let down. basically it needed a refurbishment, although it did have some cool fetures (nice bar w good cocktail list, darts, pool tables, shuttle hockey thing, other video games, gym, tennis courts, huuuuuuuuge pool, bowls, mini golf etc) but all these things arent much use when you feel like shit and have to carry a tissue box around. the dustiness of the place set off my allergies so flu like symptoms ahoy, we also had a few encounters with cock roaches as well. we spent a bit of time (trying to play) tennis, watching some travel shows, miami ink, biggest loser etc , going for nice drives and taking little scenic walks when we could and just general pottering around. Once i got my taste buds back we discovered the one saving grace of Coffs&nbsp;- &nbsp;there were some really good eateries around - we many many good cuppacinos/milk shakes, afternoon tea, lunches and some amazing dinners while out. One particular place we wish we could have stolen and put in Syd -&nbsp; best vegetarian foccacia ever, fantastic pancakes, coffee, breakkie. If you are ever in Coffs head to Sawtell and a place called I think it was Splash or Ripples or something similar (poor brain cant remember), lovely little cafe.

came back from the holiday to a lovely suprise - ive known for awhile that my boss christine is leaving the store, the day after i got back from holidays i met with the business owners and walked away being the new manager of the store! so its been a series of long days the last week as christine leaves on wednesday. although its a wonderful opportunity for me i feel sad at the same time as someone who has come to be a friend is moving away and its going to be tough boots to fill there.&nbsp;

thats basically it in a nutshell folks, sorry for robot-likeness."

"event","<strong>I will conclude</strong> by discussing some ways you can continue your own growth, so you can help yourself to become aware. Now as long as we are aware, we are always aware of <em>something.</em> Sometimes the awareness is so dim that we are in a kind of trance, but basically we are always experiencing something. Even when the anti-awareness foreces are at work, as in sleep or fainting, very often some message is coming through, such as a dream. 'what we are aware of is always the message of the unfinished situation. Usually an unfinished situation is very pressing if you allow nature to take its course. If you have a letter to answer, then this letter is on your conscious not just on your desk. The situation demands to be finished.<br />We can use this demand for self-therapy in the form of meditiation. There are many forms of meditation and people do not understand how they differ. Many people think that meditation takes place in the realm of thoughts and ideas. When I talk of meditation, I do not mean this kind of game. To use the kinds of meditation I mean is very difficult - it may take years to accomplish, especially if you are a talker. Usually people are either talkers or listeners; very few are both. People often say, ""I told myself..."" or ""I said to myself..""; but they seldon say, ""I listened to myself"" The kind of meditation I suggest is learning to listen to your thinking. You can hear yourself thinking, and listen until you can hear whether <em>you </em>are talking or <em>somebody else</em> is talking. You will find it very difficult to get the basic energy into your ears instead of your fantasy throat. But when you can do this, you will realize a very peculiar phenomenon - that is, in spite of being alone, all this thinking is essentially a substitute for encounters. It is an inner world or stage. But if you do not listen, you will not realize that you are always talking to somebody, even if it is as vague as talking to the world. You may be telling people what they should do or defending yourself, or manipulating somebody or impressing someone.<br />This is nothing especially new, but it is in this process that we come across the unpleasant experience, the block, the status quo that prevents us from becoming truly substantial and growing up. And this is where we can accomplish a great deal deliberately. It is very peculiar that we become spontaneous only by utmost discipline...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Frederick S Perls<br /><br /></strong>Gestalt therapy - thats where Im at in my degree at the moment, one strange mofo of a unit. I've been trying to listen to myself alot more, my conversations and maybe thats been contributing to the moods at the moment, some stuff half brought to the surface that a part of me is still fighting to shove it back down where it came from. I don't know, but its an interesting unit and one I must finish this week so :)"

"event","i've been feeling a bit depressed the last few weeks and i dont know why. i generally have a couple of good months and then some very :/ weeks...i don't know whether its been because work is slow so ive been working less, yet i dont think that its that as james has finished his summer class so we get to spend some good quality time together which has been wonderful.
we leave on our holiday next week which i am really looking forward to - nice to get some r&amp;r and some swimmings in, read those books, take some nice works and we are even taking our long forgotten&nbsp;tennis raquets up to have a game on the court. we have a two bedroom apartment for the week which means we have a kitchen etc so we get to cook for the week too, although i might make some homemade cookies or something to take up with us before hand, i would like to try a gluten free mix or flour from macro.
im having a look at domain at the moment and hopefully if the market stays the same then we will be able to buy a house in an area that we like in a few years time, and ofcourse if we get the loan from the bank, otherwise we wont be moving anywhere. and then i think of taking a big overseas trip and wonder where that will factor in and then i sigh because, where are we going to dig up the money for that?
sometimes i think i should just bite the bullet and get a full time job and get some money.
but then theres another part of me that is considering going for the managers position thatmight soon come up at my store
and then another, maybe bigger part of me thinks about being a funeral conductor and listening to peoples storiesm i'd really like that.
i guess on the whole i dont know what i want to do and i guess a part of me thinks that by prolonging decision i am prolonging death, but really i am just prolonging life.&nbsp;
its a very weird age indeed"

"event","<strong><u>Restaurant Review - Don Quixote<br /></u></strong>Cnr Kent and Liverpool Street, Sydney<br /><br /><br />After entering the restaurant and being lead to our booth, one of the first things my partner said to me was ""They don't look happy with us"" which was a pretty acurate comment.&nbsp; We'd walked off the street -&nbsp; him in one of those inside out design t-shirts and me in ripped jeans, probably too underdressed for their liking. After asking for a seat, the waiter looked like he was considering refusing us,&nbsp; but then grudgingly led us inside.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Ambience 6\10</strong><br />The decor of the restaurant was interesting enough, with many of the chairs being wooden with studded leather seats and backings which had mexican themed designs on them, with some skipping the motive and having full blown cow hides on them. Featured around the restaurant were various hanging rugs or paintings, again keeping in with the theme.&nbsp; The waiters were all elderly men which kinda added a certain charm to the place. However, the large room carried noise very well which made it pretty unintimate.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Food 7/10<br /></strong>We started off with some garlic bread, which were really two rolls cut in half - a generous portion for two but the rolls were a little on the stale side. We also had as an entree which was the meatball tapa - four meatballs in a tomatoe sauce. James found the meatballs rather nice but i thought they were a little on the salty side. For mains my partner had pan friend veal in a basil and lemon jus. There were three reasonable peices for veal however a distinct lack of vegetables on the plate - his comment ""nothing special"" . I opted for the seafood casserole which was a series of fresh seafood (calamari, fish, mussels, oyster and half a baby crab) in a tomatoe and lemongrass sauce. Whilst the seafood was tasty the ""sauce"" with which it came in was nothing out of the ordinary. Although I did enjoy what I could eat of such a huge portioned meal, I did feel that for a ""house speciality"" that there was something lacking in the dish.<br /><br /><strong>Service 6.5/10<br /></strong>Although the waiters were always prompt and swift in their service, we couldnt help but feel that we werent very welcome at Don Quixote. <br /><br /><strong>Value 6/10<br /></strong>We escaped from the restaurant with the garlic bread, meatball tapa, two mains, two pepsis and two mineral water (spanish mineral water mind you, I was trying to work out why it tasted somewhat different, I think James was correct in pointing out that it tasted a little more on the soda water side) for scarce under $100.&nbsp; For what we paid we felt that it was just ""average"".&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />On a whole the night was made good by spending it with James, sharing some lovely conversations&nbsp;and treating ourselves to a night out. Don't think we'll be going back any time in the next few years though."

"event","<p><font color=""#33cccc"">well i just finished watching <strong>2:37 </strong>- by Australian director Murali Thalluri.&nbsp; For those who need a bit of background, the movie starts off with an anonymous person committing suicide. The story then track backs to the start of the day and follows six teenagers through their day of school, juxtaposed with thoughts on life, what they'd like to do, how they feel about events conflicting them etc. The story ends in a pretty horrific scene of the identified person committing suicide. This film has an R18 plus rating. It's one of those films I wish that more people would watch - it's not pleasant and you'll cry through it and feel wildly angered, despaired and think how goddamned protective you'd be over your kids if they ever had a sort of disability or were teased, but its the type of movie that I think people need to watch. It doesn't give you any answers, but if makes you more aware. Some might argue that the issues that are confronted in the movie arent overly realistic, or happen to only a small majority of people but as the movie shows sometimes it just doesnt take much. There has been some talk about the film being very similar in style and genre to ""Elephant"", another movie that deals with high school life and on memory a school shooting, you also follow 6 teenagers through their day before finding out whodunnit at the end. I saw Elephant but it didnt leave the same impression on me, nor did it seem so poingnant or as beautifully style-listic as 2:37.&nbsp;<br /><br />I do recommend you watch it, but watch it with someone and have a chat about it afterwards or write about it , let it digest and see what it meant/didnt mean to you and probably&nbsp;even rent another more light hearted movie. Well, thats how I know I'm going to&nbsp;deal with it all. My choice of weapon&nbsp;tonight after such a&nbsp;troubling movie&nbsp;<strong>is Laputa: Castle&nbsp;In The Sky </strong>which&nbsp; is&nbsp;done by Hayao Miyazaki, same dude who wrote Howls Moving Castle and Spirited Away. Still has a message to it but much, much more mellower and the animations by Hayao Miyazaki is always so beautiful.<br /><br />Well in other news my parents are still in Bora Bora and so James and I have been having a grand time playing husband and wife. We tried a new chicken marinade the other night which is a keeper, we've been walking the pups and its so super lovely to have him there when i get home from ""work"". We're about to get some good time off now as the shop has been so quiet the last two weeks that had about 14 hours of work cut. Yes it means more study time but I was really counting on that money to pull us through our holiday to Coffs. Now it looks like we'll have to put the majority of our food on credit oh and petrol, and probably have about $40 a day of entertainment money. It's a good thing we enjoy anothers company, the beach and walking etc is free. We've both also got a stack of books each to get through so we can be super nerdy. If anyone would like to know what I'll be reading:<br />The Little Prince - Antoine De Saint-Exupery<br />Middlesex - Jeffrey Eugenides<br />Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman - Haruki Murakami<br />Everything is Illuminated-&nbsp; Jonathan Safran Foer<br />HELLO CRUEL WORLD: 10 Alternatives to suicide for teens, freeks and other outlaws - Kate Bornstein<br />The Ethics of What we Eat - Peter Singer and Jim Mason<br /><br />and if those are polished off then james is taking i think 4 fantasy books that I can read too :) I'm really looking forward to our holiday together, it seems like ages sicne we last went away. and will have to remember to take lots of happy snaps. i was looking at some photos today of us in our earlier years, theres not many but gosh we looked so young and ! but now we look even more in love because we are so..! And further ot love I've found another two wedding dresses i like so i shall be cutting them out of the magazine and adding them to the book...and also in the mag I got they had kinda location themes going on, including some over seas ones. The Rarotongan Beach Resort in the Cook Islands is looking very good so far! Vinni, Stace, Col, Miss Wolve and Lauren came over for dinner on Friday night and I was glad that 4 + Lauren could finally meet, as they are my definiate non-joint, non-james specific friends to come to the wedding..and vinni and lauren as the bridesmaids...actually come to think of it i didnt even mention that on the night! Poor Lauren, I hope she had an alright time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, thats all folks...I think I'll go to bed afterall...the boys and I are going to go for a monster walk before work tomorrow, so ill need some zzZZ for that x<br /><br /></font></p>"

"event","<p><font color=""#33cccc"" size=""2"">Back to work tomorrow - going to be working full time up until mid feb...so fingers crossed can keep up with finishing a unit every 3-4 weeks at the same time :/ otherwise the year&nbsp;wont be&nbsp;getting off to the best start! I lost half of an essay that I put alot of effort into...which has just created a whole lot more work.<br /><br />now that the complaining is over.<br />james and i spent new years together this year. we decided to cook dinner for another, we got some recipes from guests at our engagement party earlier this year but we decided to go for a recipe from Epicurious - <a href=""http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/printer_friendly/100581"">Roasted Veal Chops with Shallots, Tomatoes and Olive Jus</a>&nbsp;. It was highly successful and we recommend to anyone to try when they have guests over (as veal chops are rather expensive, so not an every day meal!) and if you do - we followed some advice from some comments on the website and only used salt to season. We also didnt&nbsp;use sugar and substituted the plum tomatoes (no idea what they are!) for cherry tomatoes, and roasted them for 1/2 the time. Anyway, it was a really <em>really </em>good meal. I got stuck into this lovely Tasmanian pinot that i''d brought to accompany the meal (for myself, as james doesnt drink wine), and james put many shots of malibu in his stein and filled it with vanilla coke. We had the usual ""drinking at home by ourselves"" curse. That is, we got sleepy instead of really drunk and energetic :) So we watched some XMC, some music channel, washed up, some XMen, and then as james parents got home, we watched the 12 o'clock fireworks with them and went to bed. My parents on the other hand stayed up the latest i think they have in years as my aunty and her kids are staying at my house (and have commandeered my room and bed) and they got stuck into the wine. i had a rather amusing drunken message from my aunty in the morning. so on the whole a nice, quiet new year with my wonderful boy who i havent gotten to spend much quality time with lately.<br />we had a lovely christmas though the lead up to it was painful as was working pretty much every day. Some people are just meh but othankfully the majority of our tea drinking customers are happy campers, it makes it easier to work alot but you still get tired. J and i both got very spoilt with some stuff for our future house, i also got some v good books including one called ""hello cruel worlld- 101 alternatives to suicide for teens, freanks and other outlaws"" by kate bornstein from james (who very naughtily gave me a&nbsp;divine whtie gold and black pearl bracelet...). also managed to pick up an awesome dip, cheese, cake, salad, serving platter peices all in the same pattern in the post christmas sale.<br />so now that all the xmas/ny spending is over, time to save for bdo and our holiday to coffs in feb. my parents are going away on wed to Bora Bora for their 30th wedding anniversary, so heres hoping they have a lovely time in their over-water buree. I will no doubt think of them while im scrubbing the toilets.</font></p>"

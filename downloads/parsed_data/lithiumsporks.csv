I'd give anything just to hear your voice
I couldn't pass you on the street
Without saying a word
Most times I missed the voice
That goes unheard

What if I missed you
You got caught in the sun
What if I did something
Never to be enough

People everywhere how could I be sure
Is it you that I have been looking for
What would it take for me to be comfortable
With you, with me you're the chosen one

What if I missed you
You got caught in the sun
What if I did something
Never to be enough

You are there for me this I hope and pray
You will wait for me, I wont be to late

What if I missed you
You got caught in the sun
What if I did something
Never to be enough

Will you wait for me
Or will I be to late this time
You are there for me this I hope and pray</i>

It's early Sunday morning, and i'm bored so i'm going to ramble nonsensical things.

I have things to do, but still trying to find the motivation to get off my ass. My room is in need of some serious cleaning, so badly that i slept downstairs in my brother's room coz i can't stand the damn sight of it atm.

Yesterday i had a bit of a hysterical moment after having a fight with my family. I ended up throwing a picture frame and there's shattered glass everywhere in my room. I don't think it was that moment, more like the last straw for all the repressed emotions in me. 

I was getting along with C up until Friday nite, but he decides to be his selfish goddamn self yet again. I told him I needed him and he would rather have his fun. He said i ruined his weekend. Oh ya what a complete fuck you are. I can't even lament on it because it's to the point where it's just ridiculous and just like a broken record player. 

Nothing is ever easy, i know this. But how can people be so stupid not to see things? Is my way of thinking just too difficult? Or maybe he's just too dumb to use his brain. Or maybe just plainly, he doesn't care for anyone but himself. Yes, i think that's more the answer.

He is so shady and so conspicuous. Like i'm that stupid. If only i could switch off that part of my life, delete that part. What a waste of love. Isn't that the way it always seems to be? One person loves more than the other. You give and you give, and they continuously take, not giving second thoughts of any of their actions does effect others. 

He tells me to never leave him, to not ever fall for someone else. I wish there was someone who'd totally sweep me off my feet, and rescue me from this emotional train wreck. I wish i could rip out his heart, and stomp on it and squeeze it for every drop of life in it. Give him that tightened feeling in his stomach, let him experience all my sleepless nights, where he wakes up shedding painfilled tears. 

I drive myself crazy with questions of why i can't just walk away, of how i got myself in this. I can't even answer them, only with the stupid reason is that I love him. It's like he's taken a slice of my heart, and the only way i can get away, is if he gives it back."

"event","Don't you ever tell me you love me only to treat me like you do.
Don't tell me you care for me, then brush me aside.
Don't ask me to never leave you, don't ask me for forever.
Never have I EVER given you any reason to treat me like you do. If i were to ever reduce myself to being cruel to you, I would kill myself first.

I have hardly asked of anything from you but your honesty. Never have I forced you into anything. FUCK YOU. You are nothing but scum. How can you utter the words you do to me, and always turn around to treat me LIKE I'M A PIECE OF GARBAGE??  I'm not here for you when you want me. You're suppose to love me ALL THE TIME not whenever your fucking mood decides to swing. How can you say you consider how I feel. You never gave an ounce of care, as long as YOU ARE HAPPY. My happiness has never been much of an importance to you. You say it does, but actions do speak louder than words. You have no fucking respect for me whatsoever. As many times as I have put up with every goddamn shit you have thrown at me IT STILL IS NO REASON. 

You think it's fair to be a constant asshole because of your guilty conscience WELL FUCK YOU. You think I'm easy to forget? Don't worry, sooner then later, you will get your comeuppance. I'm not goin to be vindictive, karma will bite your ass so bad you would not even be able to imagine. 

There are more things in life then little pleasures that last for 2 minutes.  Why do you lie to me? You think that I won't be able to guess with the way you are to me?  You need to start thinking. I put up with your shit for 2 years. Things that scar people for life, and I still loved you. How many times did you come home, with god knows where your mouth had been and still be able to kiss me on the lips without your lips burning? The times when I thought i was being paranoid, but all along my gut was telling me the truth? I am not stupid, you just asked me to trust you and you took advantage of it. You were also suppose to be my best friend.  What does that tell you? But you know of what we have. I know I have so much to give to someone and don't you dare fucking come running back when you regret it. 

Do you think i'm worthy of how you can be towards me? You can go back to your alcoholic slutty lowlife ways. You pride yourself in being a man and in your personality, but if your brain allowed you to look deep enough, you will see that you are nothing but an inconsiderate, selfish, horrible man."

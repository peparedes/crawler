"event","this week went by really fast like usual!

i skipped my first class today, ahhh! i wasnt feeling so hot when i woke up today! i slept over at westminster last night and this really fat guy was staring at me and emir sleeping this morning and he was breathing so loud so we had to pretend to be asleep for 20 minutes. but yeah it was nice to have today off, i ate a whole bag of salt and pepper chips and talked to marco. i took a bunch of naps as well.

i went with rachael to the computer lab to print things out and we printed out 11 copies of a creepy seductive white gorilla. and then we threw them at emily.

then i went to compton and hung out with jesse, emir, and lauren. then me and jesse went to bornhuetter and watched always sunny in philidelphia! my favorite show everrr. next we tried to find emir and ended up in some girls room watching silence of the lambs and it was ultra awks and smelled weird. 

so me and jesse went to westminster and hung out with some people there and sweet prince was being sooo annoying like usual. i walked back and was scared id get raped so i pretended to talk on my phone. 

im a lil stressed out, but not too much! i have a 5 page paper for next friday, a 12 page paper for monday, a 15 minute presentation on thursday, and a 5 minute presentation monday. whoooops. i know i can do it though! 

im not going home tomorrow it turns out, my parents are just going to pick me up on their way to columbus, i need the time to work anyways! BUT emir's roommate is going to cleveland for the weekend so we have her room to ourselves so we are having a big sleepover which im excited for!

"event","so no matter what i do, no one listens.  john asks me to tell him about my OPINIONS, so i do.  and then he just sits there and tears the hell out of them.  i thought he said to tell him my OPINIONS, not something that was fact.  i'm just so pissed off at him it's not even funny.  and then i ask him about baby names and his thoughts on breast feeding.  well, he doesn't want to have me breast feed the kid, for some god unknown reason he wants to give it man made formula because somehow that's healthier or something?  and then even better, he wants to name the kid after his father or him! HOLY FUCK, how much worse can this get?  doesn't an individual deserve their own name seperate from anyone in the immediate family?  i can't stand it.  he just pissed me off so damn much that i hung up on him.  and to make things even better, he hasn't bothered to call back.  yeah.  i'm thinking that i need to do some boyfriend searching...someone who doesn't call you back after they piss you off this much just to appologize really isn't worth your time.

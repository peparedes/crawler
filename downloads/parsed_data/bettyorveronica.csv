"event","Have you ever felt like a cartoon character? Or a fictional character in any sort of sense? Ive been catching up on some of my webcomics and i was reading College Roomies From Hell of CRFH for short (at crfh.net) and i keep seeing myself in the character ""Dave"" he is torn between 2 girls and well he is going for the option that makes him the happiest.. well damnit. thats a good idea. but its a bad idea. how do you tell someone something you know will make them feel like death? better yet how do you tell someone something that you know will hurt you as much as it hurts them? or do you even tell them... damn women and their horrible womenlike powers.... damn it all to hell."

"event","well... its been a while since i posted so i thought i would... but i dont feel like using my old journal... too many erased things... too many people knowing about it... well specifically one person... because it sucks when you need a place to vent and maybe get a little feedback and the person you need the feedback about can just read it... yeah... so maybe im a fuck up? maybe i just cant stand the thought of being tied down... or maybe im just a fucking college age guy who doesnt really want to be tied the fuck down before he starts living... thats alot of maybes... too many maybes... and then theres the longshot... longshots are always a problem... should i go for the safe bundt? or should i go with the motherfucking grandslam... for some reason its always been a betty or veronica question for me... the blonde or the brunette for you folks who dont know your comic history.. and shame on you...for a while it was a pretty easy decision... surething blonde. that works.. but for the last while its been a crazy riptide of blow ass... and well i dont do well with blowing ass.. its just not my style... i dont kow... the brunette keeps coming up in my mind and in my life... i dont think she will ever go away... what do you think?

"event","i feel constipated.. something is not aligned.. like a knotted muscle.

yesterday was my sister's birthday so i treated her to a spa massage.  the two previous therapists who worked on me before crystalized my belief that all therapists there are quite good.

but i guess thats the thing that interferes with contentment.. the comparisons. as the young therapist chopped my back with sharp jabs, i felt my muscles tensing more than relaxing and i prayed the massage would end.. i kept telling her to make it lighter, and she would lessen the pressure, but later on she would go back again to attacking my tense muscles.

next time, i will memorize the name of the previous therapist who knew what i needed.

well at least my sister liked the massage.

i am at the frickin office and again i am sooooo bored. i know there are people to follow up, minutes of the meeting to write, stupid press releases...

i can re-discover my love for this job, or find an outlet for my wild side being tame too long annoys me.

i am a novelty seeker and if i dont find something new to do, or a new idea to dissect, iget bored.

boredy bored bored.

i wished i hadnt reacted to her blog. it is simple really. feelings are feelings there is no right or wrong.

i remember getting teary eyed when she said the one person she wanted to be with her during that late night interview at a call center was her other ex.. and though i was encouraging her to find out why she is bothered about N's certain confessions... it bothered me that it bothers her at all...

i accept i will get pangs of this. after all, i have felt so secure in her love.  i have to condition myself that it wont be forever, so when her affections swing towards other people, i wont be bothered.

my security shouldnt be latched on her affections, or on any other people's loves..

God, heal me."

"event","i have several blogs and i am only able to update just one.  so i ventured updating here and i got frustrated for a full minute that i couldn't remember the damn password here.

funny, karen sent me a document she saved herself and protected with her password, and now she couldnt open it cuz she forgot the password.

i'm here to spill the fuzz in my brain, it has been sleep deprived. the white revo was coding so i left the house 6am and got to the office 640am.. not a trace of them blue mmdas in site.

i have been revisitng the kittenboard again a lot lately, and i've been trying to draft an update to my unfinished fics.. which i left hanging in year 2003.. geez, thats so 4 years ago.

attract what you think.. so what The Secret says. i have been looking at porn lately, will i attract porn? hahhahaa.

yes, i think it is true that i attract what i think, though there are some delays in the manifestations. as for example, about a month ago i have wondered how my old friends are.. and then they would text now, asking how i am.

and jobs, so many job vacancies when i have a good paying one now in a cool foundation...

and potential dates, but i'm not too interested.  it is clear that she and i are over. i am not as attached to her as before.  but the residue of romance is there, and it gets amplified when i see her... and when i talk to her i realize i again why i love her.. or loved her.. i dont know.

im happy not to be in a relationship right now. to explore areas of my character. drop my self off at uncomfortable territory, see how i will fare.

but i really really pray i get that fellowship in new mexico. my creative writing has been shelved and now it is gathering not cobwebs but mucus.

eww.

goin back to work now. yes i have been blogging here illegaly."

"event","what do i feel...

can i just intellectualize? im not good with interveiwing my heart.. but heck, fine, i'll try..

i am happy to be expanding my sphere, i am almost done with my fairy tale book, that is if i quit stalling and searching for her missing blog..

my feelings for her now have somewhat settled. i love her but the need to be ""with her"" has lessened.. alas this solitary path is leading me towards illumination...

still, i have lapses and miss her severely on some nights on some days on some idle moments...

don't get me wrong, when i see someone beautiful i drink in and appreciate.. the thing is i'm not yet with the part of sharing and letting ""potentials"" go beneath my surface.

after dating 12 people in a month, i have come to learn that without stimulating conversation i easily float away. yes, there has been profound conversation..

Date #7: What? You're bi? How do you girls actually ""do"" it?

Me: It is not so much in the ""doing"" although we do it a lot. It has more to do with feeling.

Date #7: How can you fall for someone your own sex?

Me: Do you choose the person you fall in love with? 

Date #7: Yes I do. Love is a mental choice.

Me: I guess if we can't agree on the basic definitions such as ""love"" then we better not discuss further.

**

Date #10: WOW. You're bi. Ever thought of doing a threesome?

Me: Definitely. Keanu Reeves, Angelina Jolie, and me.

**

No one is what they seem from the outside.

**

I long for our easy conversations, what I used to have. Change can be jarring sometimes.  I wish I could talk to her again about anything and everything at all.  I guess all along I'm in search of friendships.  Even the good friendships need some tune ups.

Still miss her."

"event","without fail, i check her un-updated blog everyday hoping to learn how she is doing.. i wonder. will i be jealous if she is dating now? ofcourse...

she made me feel so secure and spoiled with the thought that she will love only me.. breaking up with her i must consider the possibility that she will fall out of love one day. and that would be sad.. but that's fair.

here i am exploring my inner and outer selves.. meeting people.. opening my heart to everything.. I know I still love Karen and I am not ready to foray into another romantic relationship yet until i am comfortable with my sexuality and have a healthier love of self... but nonetheless i havent thought what i will feel if i find out she is over me.

loving myself more and more.. i know i'll find the courage to really let her go.  whenever i drive to san juan, or see a thing that reminds me of her, all i could think of is getting back together once my life seminar is done...

but i know i shouldn't be thinking about her as my comfort blanky.. i am my own comfort blanky and i can be strong enough to love myself without sucking other people's supply...

i just need to believe i am complete with or without her.

i need to believe."

"event","i miss her again, it comes in thoughts and pangs of feelings. i am expanding my horizon outward by appreciating the depth of my inward.

the workshop/council meeting yesterday made me realize i still cling to a lot of judgements that prevent me from fully enjoying relationships.. my tendency to psycho analyze robs me of the joy of just being..

there is a time to just be.. and a time to analyze... and not all people welcome analysis. unwlecome analysis..

it all boils down to how i am still working on accepting myself fully.. i look around, thinking how i can fix the problems.. world problems, family problems, love problems. i give advice when it is asked.. but sometimes i give analysis and judgements without invites...

still, i accept that i am a work in progress.. i am continually making myself aware..

the things i do.. a lot of times i accomplish things at work or meet my goals because i just want to be 100%.. i dont want the hassle of someone reprimanding me so i do what they need me to do.. ayoko mapahiya or sabihan i'm not doing my job...

it gets the job done, i get most of my goals.. but what is the value of that? what am i feeling and being while im going after my goals?

i forgot the joy the love and the passion. like in the enrollment goal.. i just wanted to be a hundred percent.. not really just to communicate my love... a lot of agendas in my head.

perhaps i was the same way during my relatioship with karen. i love her, but i psycho analyzed too much and i judged her... not accepting wholly who she is.. if i did i wouldnt have any issues about the ""independence thing"" the mom thing.. the whatever thing.. acceptance means knowing full well who she is and embracing that.. 

acceptance doesnt mean i have to agree with everything.. i may disagree and keep my own views.. i would just stop insisting my own views.. the ""you shoulds"".. 

i have a lot to learn about love.. and until i stop judging myself and just accept myself for who i am.. i wont be fully enjoying the blessing of being in a loving relationship.

i love karen, but i had a lot of judgements. sabi ng isang coach, love without acceptance can kill a relationship.. nakakasakal.

acceptance acceptance acceptance.. easily uttered.. someday i will master you."

"event","Yesterday i met up with Karen and Nerissa, then jude and rhea came along.  It's a bit weird. For the first time we are with our friends and we are not an ""us"" anymore.  And I am sort of getting this vibe of her wanting to distance herself cuz when i gave an ""unsolicited hug"" she sat there and didn't move... but it feels good to hug her.

and when nerissa went to the john, we got to talk privately a bit.. i stroked her hand.. a hand that knew hard work and caring for other people.. a hand that cupped my cheek countless of times and made me feel loved and beautiful.. i can't help thanking her.. then i think i mouthed the words ""i love you"" but i stopped myself.. 

where did that came from? i wasn't planning to tell her that.. but my heart felt like it.. and in practice of LEAP, I am trying to be less cerebral and listen to my heart more.. so if heart wants to say that then fine.

I told nerissa about this mini-crush i have in one of my team mates in LEAP.. i was sort of intrigued by her.. so i googled her and found out she is a tv personality, and this is where ""attract what you think"" comes in because trish called me yesterday arranging for a meet up cuz she wants to discuss about foundation work.

So after my council meeting yesterday.. which was very enlightening and freeing (we did a lot of clarification why we chose our goals, what value it is to us).. trish dropped by and had dinner with all of us.. di pala sya pretty pag naka-make up... we also bonded with two other coaches over pizza.. it was fun and energizing to be with ""can-do-anything"" kind of people... 

Rhea texted me last night and she's really into the success culture.. she is hungry for learning and i think she is at a precipice of discovering her own greatness.

nerissa is discovering her love of self by falling in love deeply with another human being..

si jude, nag-improve ng presentation of self to others.. i can see he is happy.  corny pero i want everyone to feel happy. life is too short to be spent in misery.

thank you Lord for my family and friends."

"event","I am a hot babe.

Even though I'm claiming it, there are some cringing embarrassment at the periphery but i choose to ignore it.. because it is more fun being a hot babe than being a beautiful person who is blind to her own greatness..


This life seminar i am taking called LEAP is helping me bring out the me I've always wanted to be.  I feel so happy and blessed to be re-discovering and reclaiming the power I have...

Some of my major learnings:

1) Goals will literally fall into my lap without me working hard for it.. if only i totally embrace my wholeness and exude my greatness.  A new car won't make me affluent.  Several hot dates won't make me attractive and desirable... when I feel already affluent and desirable and loving inside.. that new car and those dates are just bonuses... reflections of what is already within.

2) Planning sometimes doesn't work. There are times where being ""in the present moment"" matters more.  I plan what I'll say, what I'll share, what will make me appear smart and confident.. but in the middle of the sharing i connected to what i am saying.. i allowed myself to feel and veered from the script in my head then suddenly i am about to cry in front of those people i barely knew.. sharing a very intimate thing about me.. this wasnt the plan.. but it feels damn good.. and that moment reminded me my spontaneity is what i have been repressing and what has been making me feel un-excited and un-joyful..

i am so happy to feel and to just be...

3) The Makeover.. there's a chair with my name on it.. i entered a room and this team of fashionistas, hairdressers and make up artists where all over me.. i felt scared but excited.. a fresh new talent who is about to enter a tv show.. and wow.. i never thought i could were a tube and high heeled clogs, ears dangling with huge hoop earrings and strut my stuff.. RAMPA RAMPA.. and the crowd cheered... the way I hear people cheer in may daydreams and fantasies of being a hot babe in the spotlight.. i've always thought they are just harmless fantasies that aren't really meant for reality.. there is joy and comfort in keeping fantasies unreal cuz making it real will lose its appeal... BUT HOW WRONG I WAS... I've always wanted to feel beautiful but i haven't been taking my body seriously in figuring out what will make it feel and look good...

and damn, I saw the made over me and I looked good.. but more importantly I am amazed by my own daring and beauty.



LEAP is making the old shy me very very uncomfortable... but the me I have always keeping control of.. the wild woman who wants to be like Angelina Jolie, live out adventures... that inner me is very very happy.

God, thank you for life and chances.  MMMMMWAH!

"event","The art of procrastination... i know i can always finish what i need to finish anytime... really i should finish consolidating the acitivities for October but i don't feel the urgency.

i don't have the urgency about life in general, i am a dandelion.. wisps of cotton... blown by the wind.. bobbing up and down...

i have reached the plateau of non-thirst non-hunger non-feelings... i want to be shaken up by a meteor crash... be hungry for life again...

after all it is a gift.. my heart pumping without me telling it to do so..

i lost myself, a godless person, a slave to lust, a charred drift wood barely recognizable from black abyss..

i don't feel good i dont feel bad i dont feel

if all my feelings died today i believe my mind can pull things through, i could convince everyone im okay and everything, i can be on auto-pilot...

or i can do what Sumire did in Sputnik Sweetheart and split myself into two...

or i could jolt myself to wakefulness..

revel in my insignificance... an ant on an elephant... 

still fragmented, broken, i could disappear... it would be interesting to leave this shell of mine and see where i will go... and when i go back to my body will my mind remember where my soul has been?

i watched in national geographic that dreams are a way of emptying the brain of anxious thoughts.. its a wholly brain activity, dreaming is, a way of reviewing past events... it is nice to know God designed my body in such a way it can self cope.

bodies get a fever to fight the virus,  even runny noses is a means to expel the dirtied fluids... we sweat so our heated bodies can cool down.. our wounds contract to seal itself and proctect itself..

yes the human body has inherent coping mechanisms.. God is a genius.. as for loneliness and sadness... a heart's coping mechanism takes more than a fever or a sealed scab...

better get back to work now, that's twice my boss looked over my shoulder and mightve seen what my computer monitor says..

im not giving up on life. far from it. im waging a war to get my fire back."

"event","It was a bloody floody monday night. i picked up my sister at gelleria who can't leave office until 7pm or so.. so i parked the car outside galleria, right across the galleria suites, then passed time in the mall by having a facial.  so after waiting, my sister comes and we step out of the mall to find the mall surrounded by brown water... shin level... i hated that i parked outside but i also hate parking inside galleria... i knew i shouldve parked inside...

so my sister and i rolled our pants and treaded the flood waters, our feet and shins disappearing into murky depths... my pink pants drenched, rolled out, felt heavy.. once we reached the car we discarded our pants and covered our legs with our jackets.. i drove wearing undies! well underneath anyway.. 

this teaches me a lesson that my fear of what happened in the past should not affect my present decisions.. its just that in my experience, trying to find a parking space inside the mall is hell.. but because of monday night, i realized parking across galeria when it is raining is the worst kind of hell.

i miss karen so much. i don't know how to deal... i texted her if she wants to meet up this saturday... i miss seeing her and talking to her... sometimes i kick myself (inwardly) when i think ""I need her""... i shouldn't do that.. those pangs of yearnings will go away, hopefully someday... 

its a bummer shes not even in friendster anymore... she really is withdrawing.. so i wanted to withdraw too so i deleted her name in my cellphone.. but i have her number memorized so its useless... i transferred all her text messages in my notebook, copied it in pen and ink and deleted the messages in my phone... i stuffed all her letters and photos in one box.. her painting from Greece stashed on top of my closet.. want to clear everything that will remind me of her..

but all it takes is one sappy song in the radio.. or my lying down on my bed thinking about the pile of pillows she used to put underneath my knees to make me comfortable... one small thing triggers all the good feelings and memories...

i feel i still love her but i don't think it is... i am a poor judge... everything i feel and think is driven by the longing... when the longing stops then i can become a better judge...

well maybe i should cancel the meet up this saturday and really stop being in her life.. who cares if i miss her... wonder how she is... just hang... 

fuck this, i know i want to see her.  its just that she wants space, and maybe space is good. total withdrawal.  i dont want to promise that i will never text or call again.. but maybe i should.. i mean she can do it, so can i... i can do this... remember when she called from the motel, she really wanted a goodbye.. sever ties...

fuck this shit.. i just want to find out how she is, maybe i can see her for a 20 minute lunch.. i can watch the spanish film fest by myself.. been a while since i watched a movie alone.. i used to do that all the time..

fuck fuck.. i dont really have friends because i allowed it.. no sick-head you have friends but you are just too busy moping and sulking.. nobody wants to be around with a sulking van...

fuck.. only God will be able to understand me.

maybe i'll withdraw"

maybe she transferred her blog to a new url.. good for her then.  if she did transfer blogs, then perhaps it is a statement for me to give her real space.

i texted her last night, but i don't regret it. maybe i should try changing my SIM, after all theres no sun number i'll be calling or who would be calling me 24/7...

or this is just unfounded speculation, maybe the blogger server is down.. but both her blogs? Hmmmm. I should really try not to be concerned about her life anymore, it is really not my business.  im not even a friend yet, remember?

oh its pathetic, dont start cryin again in the office, van.  so much to do remember? the lgfi website, you update your blog more than the website. and your lil writing projects.. live goes on.. let go of the Zahir... it is not even love that your feeling, just a need to be with the one person who has fulfilled your needs.. you were wanted, needed, and loved.. now stop being selfish and accept that she won't be there anymore. convince yourself.. She isn't there anymore... not for you... not for you.. because you chose it.. you broke up with her... and you gotta be a whole person before you can clear your heart and soul and be free to love again...

it is natural to miss her, the first person you committed to, the first person you gave yourself to, body and heart... 

you will one day let go of the zahir,  and your obsession is not really her... your obsession is to cling to someone who you think will love you always.. that is a disease.. you cannot find love elsewhere van, but in yourself.

in yourself. let her go, van. let go of your need. stop being like a child who lost her favorite teddy bear. you dont need teddy bears you just have to genuinely like yourself from now on.. okay? got that?

no my heart doesn't get it yet. im not there yet. im still needy and clingy and i will cry if i want to. in the office, in the car, while taking a bath... let it mourn let it mourn.. it's hard but it is the only way to become free of need.  when you come from emptiness, you have freedom, unbiased decisions. you will have clarity about what your soul is looking for.

and remember, God's will is for you to find your deepest yearning.  right now, you may think your deepest yearning is her -- the only one who has shown you you are deserving to be loved -- but right now you are coming from the space of need, the space of wanting to get back to where it is comfortable, back to the known happy place with her... empty yourself van.. keep pouring until your mourning reaches the last drop.

then fly. ask God for wings."

the expo was tiring and fun.  the crowne plaza food is good (especially Sea Bass, but Antonios was better) and i pocketed a lot ot the complementary Ceylon tea bags and raw sugar... my only peeve is the gala dinner food servings which were so small... i think that some restaurants deliberately kept things in small servings to make it more 'appealing' and taste buds to be 'hungry for more.'

i am happy for nerissa's kilig stories, and i had fun just hanging out with her and rhea at kopivatore (or something like that) in morato right after the tribute to Ka Elmo.  i am reminded i have friends, and more importantly, I am a friend, and it is a nice feeling to support and be supported.

rx monster radio riot today on my way to work when i heard the Calling's live version of ""i will go wherever you will go, way up high or down low.."" as i zipped through ortigas ave crossing towards edsa then galleria... the tears just poured out of nowhere... i miss her friendship, even during the relationship, even now after...

the process of unlearning is harder than learning. it would be unfair to ask time from her to talk, because i truly feel space between is what we need in order to... (using her own words).. take the break-up seriously.

"event","bleary eyed i tried to escape the coding thing this morning coz i figured i needed a car later if im attending that LEAP 30 preview thing. 

even though im going to that seminar preview, i still have reservations about joining the 3 month seminar. i am already anticipating the goals i will have to finish within three months of the program.. i remember during my starshooters the pain of processing and being processed by different people.. i remember the pain of honesty, and the pain of seeing myself clearly -- faults, flaws, and assets and all...

i live a life of convenience by pushing truth at the back. but after the ache of the break up, i feel i owe it to myself to take my growth, to stare at the truth, and actually do something about it.

truth one: i am needy... i cling to any source of love i could find, and for the first time in my life i was able to help myself with a steady source - karen... and it helped me a lot.. but i have minimum love for me so i felt both happy and sad.  but letting her go, i think is one of the bravest things i did. i could so easily have kept her with me, my warmy fuzzy comfort blanky.. its hard, still is, memories of how wonderful it is to have her as my partner still sting me at the most unsuspecting moments... but i have to steel myself... the best thing i could ever do for me is to love fully without holding back, until i know how to do that, i will become a subtle vampire in all my relationships.

i rememebr natalie goldberg used to say some people use writing to get more love. and that's exactly what i do.  i wrote fan fics because i was hungry for the adoration that comes with the feedback.. the impressed ""ooh your a writer.. oooh!"" that i get and crave. anything that will get me love and attention, although to the world i am a calm and composed person, inside is a ravenous dark void that eats my own light. That's it, i haven't fed the ravenous monster with  my own light.

Self-depracation is something i do as a defense. when i person hurls criticism at me, i protect my self by out-hurling that person with more criticisms about me.. it's like i'm saying.. so you think you know my faults? here are other faults.. help yourself!!!

I also have a penchant for drama, it is my way of keeping things interesting.. another ploy to get attention.. i remember slamming the cemented walls of the house with my fist, causing the paintings, frames, to slide down and crashed the image of Mary of Guadalupe.. i remember throwing a saucer against the wall because they forgot to leave food for me.. and my siblings are happy to remind me i gave my parents the deepest embarrassement by throwing a loud tantrum inside a public transport to Bagiuo-- ofcourse i have no recollection of this -- but it is already a clue on how i strategize to get attention and love.

and i manipulated karen that way too.. to the tune of black eyed peas.. drama drama, you don't want no drama... i pulled the dramatics at her that crazy saturday... and all of my self pity came to the fore..

i am not asking myself to be perfect.. i am asking myself to be a bit nicer to myself.

it is good that i am single now. i have escaped a lot of ugliness that i want to face squarely now that i only have me in the equation.

Lord, stay by my side. keep my monsters at bay.  i'm scared to ask for christian counselling. i still think my past abuse has nothing to do with who i am now.. but maybe there are still murky areas i have avoided to really know.

My heart is restless until it rests upon You, Lord..."

"event","8am, great no one is in the office yet.. no calls no emails to answer no boss following up my list of deadlines.. i wanted to unload...

sunday we went to paranaque, a great distraction from the turmoil im trying to hide from my family.  although my legs ached cuz my nieces decided to make their human see-saw, my worries disappeared momentarily when i played with the kids.

kids have it all, they laugh when they want to laugh, whine when they want to, and people will understand them coz they are kids.. i wonder why grown ups have to master their emotions, learn to mask it... be the one to control it, not be the one controlled by emotions.. and i guess i controlled my emotions fairly well.. i was in no mood to go out, but i dont want my family to suspect anything.  Riding the white revo was too much.. the saturday, her and me inside that same car.. still fills my mind... i wanted to cry as i stared out of the blur of streetscaped.. and then we went to gateway cuz my mum had to watch the UE vs UST game with dad, so brother, iyay, eden and i wandered in gateway.. which magnified my memories of her.. fuck thats the nike women, and fuck.. thats cibo where we broke up.. oh and big fuck. thats oasis right in the middle of everything where we spent many lovely afternoons talking over a hot cup of cocoa.. more than anything i wanted to be alone.. so i was glad bro had to look for something and the oldies wanted to sit in the food court, i excused myself and walked alone for a while..

crying in the mall is one of the saddest things.. it is the place where families go to, to have fun, couples to bond, friends to re connect.. all this throng of people and i feel as if no one is there but me and my sadness...

i am sad to know i won't be hearing or seeing her anytime.. for a very long time.. i'm sad to be reminded that i am not the independent woman i prided myself to be.. i have to wake up to the reality that i have my own shackles to shake free... there are still house rules i live by... and she who barely asked anything from me...i denied again..

deep down i know also it is not the 'it' the this-is-'it' kind of relationship.. because i know i am not ready to stand by who i am, and i am also not sure of the forever and ever thing with her... i love her a lot... so much... and now that it has ended i know for sure i really love her... i love her even without the relationship, even without the comfort she brings... i just do..

but i know i have made the right decision coz if i don't see forever, then i should let it go..

i talked to jude over the phone and he said he knew of this couple who broke up, had relationships with other people, and after two years of seperation, the couple got back together again and got married... ""kung kayo talaga, eh di magiging kayo pa rin...""

and i guess i have to trust the process, the process of life, the process of love. if my journey leads me back to her, then hopefully we can get a second chance.. if my heart will still yearn for her after facing my fears, the unkown, and being exposed to different people.. then i know she is the 'it' i was too blind to see...

but then if my journey makes me realize otherwise.. then i am happy to have shared something beautiful, meaningful.. to have truly loved.. to have been loved by someone as warm, as beautiful, as giving as her... i thank the heavens and all the dieties i have experienced what i have experienced with her... i will not exchange it for anything in the world.. even the not-so-good times...and the wonderful heart-bursting great times... the peaceful moments of perfect contentment in her arms.. nothing can take those away from me..


I still long for that getaway, hold her all night, but now i know it will not happen anymore.. i missed my chance..

i still love you, karen. and don't worry about saturday, you are rarely needy... so it is okay.. you are not a bad person for asking me for what you really want.. i dont think of you any less.. i love you. and it is time for us to go on seperately.. at least until we are ready to begin our friendship."

"event","Dad has three stones, in the urethra (or something like that), near one of the kidneys, and a gallstone.  Also, his liver needs to be Ct scanned coz the doctors suspect something is wrong there too.

Typical dad. i know there is no point in blaming the sick person himself.. but i just have to let out a bit of my frustration... it is typical of him not to seek medical help until his sickness as wayy to advanced. It's the same way how he dealt with hi-lander during his ownership, he wont get the little damages fixed until the problem is very bad... and now i inherited that car full of sickness... okay snap out of blame mode.. in a way i understand him coz i am sometimes like that too. He is always worried about costs costs costs.. obstacles obstacles obstacles... i just hope and i pray his stones will be removed safely... if only he won't be bull headed anymore.

so it's 930AM in the office now, my to do list keeps getting longer, but i just need to ramble some more... the great thing about blogs is that it is always available especially in moments you want to vent... confiding to friends is great, but the time factor and non-aligning of schedules is something to consider. whereas you blog, boom, instant friend.

another shouting match broke the night, or was it round 2am i think? probably one of my drunken neighbors or uncles again, wanting to stir some things up for a lack of better things to do. so i was momentarily snatched from my sleep when i heard a booming sound, like a giant was trying to shake one of the trailer trucks in our street.. my first thought was.. just dont let them hit revo or hilander, i dont care if they hurt each other.

i forgot to mention mum, dad, and i slept in the car the very saturday i met up with karen. its the fucking floods that made the araneta ave steets look like a raging black river, passible only to trucks.. the few Adventures and revos we saw valiantly venturing into the dark depths all conked out on the street..i wonder.. where the FUCK all my FUCKING six thousand pesos of taxes every month goes into???!!! The DPWH can do and MMDA can do is make the sewerage and drainage systems work! I was half hoping an MMDA truck or a volunteer fire truck something would come along and scoop the water out, or have a vacuum hose of sorts..  but no knight in shining truck armor came... so a whole street-full of vehicles parked on the sides, my dad parked the revo in the nearest shell gas station where some other 10 vehicles are parked to.. waiting waiting for the water to subside. I think we parked at 10PM and we left the gas station at 1AM... mum was the only one who was able to get sleep inside the car.

anyway, im looking forward to gulp some positive air, i plan to re-audit the psi basic seminar on the 14th and the 15th after office.. i still havent come around in making an appointment with the light of jesus counsellor..

i just read her blog and i thought... yeah maybe... maybe i wasnt satisfied with the connection we have (or had, now that its past), i know i love her, and many times that is the only connection that matters.. but perhaps there are other parts i didnt see connect.. i don't know.  this is why it is sort of exciting to know her again, as if seeing her again for the first time... reading more about her thoughts, makes me happy... since we rarely got the luxury of sharing thoughts and the privacy to do so... reading her blog has become somewhat a furtive pleasurable pastime of mine.

last sunday the priest's homily wasn't boring... a rare incident indeed... the gospel was about Jesus healing the deaf... and today, a lot of us are unaware of being deaf.. the priest says.. you are deaf if you don't know how to listen openly.. this means if you are listening to someone while your mind is busy already making a response, or a rebuttal -- that is not openly listening... and i am guilty of this lots of times.

i want to be a better listener.  there are only a handful of people i know who are good at open minded listening-- Karen (she always lets me go ahead whenever we speak at the same time) and Nerissa (she could hold back all of her comments while i am doing the talking)... i remember chris is also a good listener, she won't make you feel judged or being weighed when you talk to her..

me on the other hand, i interrupt people in mid sentences, when i disagree and get fired up, i dont always wait for my turn to speak.  my old programs of being a bunso who has to be heard among the more logical arguments of my older siblings.. all come to the fore when i am passionate about a topic.  yes, i guess it will do wonders for my relationships when i master this art of listening."

"event","There are times crawling inside one's cave is good, but there are times that going out to find out how are the other people in the other caves are doing.. could help ease the troubles of living.. i read the blogs of my friends Jude and Ellen, and as Jude said over the phone, Ellen went through some tough times... now i know why there are times i feel lonely, i haven't been hungry curious to find out about my friends. Ofcourse there is the occassional how are you, and even the more seldom get togethers and writing/artist dates.. it's just that lately my greater need was for self-reflection and missing karen. but now i realize, although on the surface my friendships are okay, it needs to be sparked to life again. i remember i was happy being single before because i liked my job and i had meaningful friendships that are not just limited to ""how are you"" conversations, but also to ""how is your soul doing and your heart feeling now? What do you feel is your life purpose? Do you really believe in angels and devils?""

I met up with karen last saturday. i am listening right now to the CD she gave, i am supposed to be doing a powerpoint presentation right now for my boss, but i have a greater need to write first in this journal.

seeing her, her roundish form, her conditioned hair that she probably spent hours combing and getting dry.. watching her as she left our coffee bean table to get our Prada movie tickets, her walk half confident strides and half bouncy springs like kids do... my feelings run and say how could i have ever leave her.. this bouncy sunshine in human form...  but the thought passes, she's back to the table with our tickets, back to the awkward place of trying to be as casual as friends when my skin remembers the warmth of her hugs, the moist warmth of her lips... i mentally snap back myself to the present.. noting to myself why i chose friendship at this time.

more than ever, i want to be certain of my orientation, i want to accept myself, seek my soul's deepest desire, go for it, be guided by God's prodding.. be certain of who I am, before being intimate with another human being. and finally shed my fears in front of my own mirror, then my family's mirror... see my naked self without grimaces, embrace who i am...

my body has a memory, my heart and especially my mind.. and they all come to the surface when she is right in front of me.. and they sneak into my depths when she is <i>not</i> in front of me.. i am thinking love and attachment is simply a tea bag i have to saturate in water again and again.. perhaps until there is nothing to be extracted anymore, and the tea bag feels happy for having given juice from every speck of tea leaf inside it...

but if ever i dont stop longing and loving her, i am not worried.  i am also not worried if i stop loving her in a romantic way.  i am just happy to feel certain about one thing, that i will make it a point to include her in my life... a constant variable.. it is just the dependency i need to work on.. and i have a lot of work to do.. just seeing her round shoulder, makes me want to lean my head on it.. not a good idea when both of us are trying to get over each other.

it's funny, most people break up because they dont love each other anymore. i feel we still love each other and need each other badly.. so why break up? and it goes back to the question, what is my deepest yearning, and when i find out, will i be ready to stand for it even if it might mean hurting my family.. the people i love the most? I have to be ready to bite the bullet. but first find out why i am attacking myself. i must feel something is wrong with what i am if i feel i need to hide it from my parents.. i am also scared of talking to a christian counselor, but how else could i find out what the other side of the coin says?

I love God. I love my family. I love Karen... and I love myself.. and could those loves be at odds with each other? Isn't love the unifying factor? YEs. I still think it is the unifying factor... it is my fears that are tearing these loves apart, my fears that make me feel disjointed for a while now...

Lord i need your guidance.. Lead me by the hand and make me face the rising sun..."

"event","that kid leah salonga song.. happiness... always cheers me up when i hear it.. it goes something like: ""happiness, is, one scoop of icecream..."" or something like that :)

just to cheer myself up, here are my revised lyrics for the song..

Happiness is
Typing on a soft keypad
Having my own space to think
Watching DEBs and girl fan fics
Watching fave movie clips at you tube
Rereading Harry Potter
Having time to think and gaze aimlessly at the office
Minding my own business
Having a non-fish dinner
Hi-Lander not conking
Meeting deadlines
Reading a good book in my room
Not being pressured
Driving with no traffic
Seeing the real XPC plate yellow van out of nowhere
Sharing a joke with a friend
Discovering her again, smiling as i read her blog
Salvaging friendships i thought were dead
Pushing myself to be more and do more
Taking more rest than work
Eating hershey symphony toffee chocolate
Running around ultra
watching the sun's descent
Writing out of thin air
making up stories
hearing stories from friends
seeing my mum and dad sitting together on our sofa
having money to buy the family non-fish breakfast
bacon, longganiza, hot cakes
oh! Heaven and Eggs with Karen :)
Remembering what i had with Karen
Having clothes to wear
Retiring my old worn black shoes
Recruiting a new shoe 
Parking slots waiting for me
Gateway lazy boy cinema seats
Sharing ideas and experiences with friends over coffee
The rustle of leaves and the quiet at The Farm
Fork sinking deep into tender beef at Antonios
Antonios green tea shake
Sharing desert with Karen
Retreats with God by my side
My guardian angel, unflatering
Life.. here.. now.. beautiful

this photo i took in pagudpud in 2004, i think. posting it here, i know karen will see what i saw.. almost as if we are watching the same sunset together.. i know i promised to cease communication, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy what God created for everyone to see.. a sunset is beautiful when watched alone, but it can mend hearts when two aching people watch it together.. we are not yet friends yet, but there are quiet joys non-friends and ex-lovers can share ;)

"event","I wanted to be early this Monday so I can finish my writing deadlines before I am bothered by calls and summons from my boss... but when i get here in my office i just wander off, warm up mentally, then get to work..

As i backed hi-lander into parking slot nummber 19, wearing my pink blazer uniform... i mused to myself if ever i really dreamed becoming this grown up.. look at me driving my car, wearing a corporate get-up, light make-up, even my hair has become a bit long, rushing to catch the elevator that is almost always about to close... i muse... did i really dream of becoming this adult?

In a way, my deep longing was to be part of positive change, which is partly what i am doing with the foundation i am working in... but i'm still tied 8am to 5pm monday to friday. I guess i am longing for time to become under my own terms... now if i can be part of positive change, own my time, travel at whim, earn passive income, forge deeper relationships... then i guess that would be the grown-up me i dreamt about.

Saturday was fun, dad was sick so i was family driver -- which i get to do every now and then but i like driving the white revo so no worries. it's just that finding parking at world trade center during the book fair was a nightmare.  My mum had to make <i>paki-usap</i> to the guards of the training center beside world trade, and alas her PNB connections didn't fail us. Given one hour and a half to explore, i limited my wanderings to stores i know would have some quality authors.. i have been thinking of buying Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" but all the have is his ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" which also intrigued me since i have about three trusted friends who already told me it is one of the books i should read before i die.. but skimming the spines of Marquez's books, my eyes fell upon another ""M"" author... Murakami... I heard from Ces, in one our last phone conversation before she left for the San Francisco, that he is really good. So I picked up his ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" read the first page about Sumire... a college girl who fell for the first time in a tornado-kind of way, whith a married woman who is ten years her senior... i wasn't really hooked by the plot but i definitely was charmed why Sumire came to call Miu her ""Sputnik Sweetheart.""  And yay! 20% off so instead of paying 475, i paid 375.  It has been a while since i bought a book for myself so it is satisfying in a way.  Karen has bought me a lot of books, and i am happy at the thought of the many Natalie Goldberg books waiting for me at home.  they are like my trusted friends who resides in my room whom i can turn to any time i wish.

I just wish i could talk to her.. to Karen.. any time i wish.. it has always been my longing even during the course of our relationship. i miss her badly as my friend.. more than anything.  

Mum treated us to Kimono Ken at blue wave to celebrate her first salary (in a manner of speaking) and then i drove us home.  As I made the turn to roxas boulavard i saw traders hotel and BAM! I was hit by that pang of longing... and sadness... and it becomes magnified as i calmly steered the Revo and pretended I am a-okay, but inside sadness is trying to find a temporary residence, but i shooed it away.. no vacancy for you Mr. Sadness, come back another day when i am not driving the family.

Sunday, i felt really lonely, i wrote in my journal. read coehlo and murakami and a bit of rowling, still their company made me long for a real human being to talk to.  I sighed and wondered which friend can i call, and i realized i dont have much friends left who i can talk to deeply about this longing in my heart. then i remembered, well at least i still have a few quality friends.  i am happy i got to talk to nerissa, and we got to talk about death, one of her dearest friends just died, and that kind of puts a lot of things in perspective.  death always does.  the need to talk to karen is still there, i just hope we can still really be friends but i guess she would be needing time alone... always alone... but i hope not lonely.

back to work now, switching on business van."

I stare at the blue felt of my cubicle
And my mind reaches to special places
Places where we tickled
Places where we got caught
Places where we are free

She took this photo of me
As I face the sunlight
Another sunlight warms me
from her love
from her hair
from  her mere breath

No I do not need to go to Lipa Batangas to go to that special place
I need just to reach in my mind,
Reach not too far in my heart
And I smile, lace my fingers behind my head,
lean back
As I trundle back and forth
to our special place..."

resting on her
even the darkness 
is comforting
the light 
caressing

a moment slipping into
a realm that is ours

there are is no she, he, me,
no he for he, she for she
there is just a cocoon
an entwining

labels melt and rest
in a long line of a horizon

I will always remember what we have
Even if someday the longing will waver
The tenderness pressed between the yellow pages of memory
Will leave an imprint
Forever"

and take me away
and make me Your own, Lord my God, make me Your own...


Every once in a while, my heart, mind, soul rest completely
swayed in a hammock
unafraid
and clarity, God loves me God loves me God loves me...
overshadows my mortal needs...

i am happy to re-discover again
i am happy to be weak so i can lean again
lean on the only strength that never falters..
God

I just came from the retreat and here are some of my learnings:

1) For far too long I have relied on my own intellect, my emotional strength... on other people's love to complete me.. I rediscovered i am naturally going to empty again and again if I don't have God in my life.
2) I have sought substitutes to fill in the void in my heart, and I rediscovered there is only one source of ageless unconditional love, a love that has been given to me even before I swam in my mother's womb...
3) Forgiveness is a continuing process, and so is love..

My commitments:
1) To have a regular, solitary praying time/ reflection time that I will not compromise for anything
2) Join a spiritual community
3) Be of service actively to a community, starting with my family
4) Talk with a spiritual counselor

And though I still love her, the need to have her as my partner has eased a bit. The need to be the one to call her ""mine"" has lessened. I am not a fish gasping to get back in the water that is she... her love was encompassing, i clung on for dear life... now I remember there is a bigger source of love I can tap without hurting anyone.. God's love... receiving that is the key to my self-love.

Lord, I pray to stay in Your love. I also pray Karen may live the fullness of life.  Realize her greatness.. she is such a powerful loving person... she is more free than she thinks she is because she has no fear when it comes to giving love... please bless her Lord, keep her heart whole...

I miss her, but I'm okay now.  With your love Lord, I can rehabilitate my co-dependency.  One small step after ther other... I can do this, not by myself, but with You.  I am getting to be excited at the thought of loving her from afar, without any need to possess... i used to get jealous, even jokingly, when she sort of fancies a friend... i envy the deep connection she has with a certain friend... now i know where was that coming from.. i wanted to be the only one who has her full attention... and that is just childish..

So here I am, working at letting her go in that way.. fly my love, fly Karen, fly free.  :-)

i want to be very busy coz if i wasn't all i do in the office is read and re-read her blog, think about her, read my past emails to her, read my journal, update my journal, think about her some more, get the urge to text her...

the office is not the proper place to mope. even my officemates noticed my puffy eyes and asked if i cried so i had to make up a story that is close to the truth...

the painting she gave is just a perfect reminder of the tenderness we shared, and it makes me sob everytime i look at it... i guess i can postpone framing it.. dont know if i will place it in my room or my office cubicle... either way it will just make me sad and wistful...

wonder how long i'll be in mourning, as soon as i get busy perhaps.. i've been cramming my mind with all the goals i want to pursue..here are some of them...

learn a martial art (aikido perhaps)
learn to be graceful and confident (social/ballroom dancing or street modern dance?)
Seek counseling (from spritiually mature people who have a deep understanding about homosexuality and love)
Date my parents (and perhaps eventually come out to them)
Join LEAP (goal getting for three months)
Save and invest in foreclosed properties (real estate or any form of passive income)
Move out of the house (preferably in the property i will be renting out to tenants)
love without fear (let go of my own fears about loving unconventionally)
Talk to lots and lots of people, guy, gay girl, bi guy, bi girl, straights... 

and though it is too soon to tell, and i am not in the right state of heart to decide right now, but once i let go of my inhibitions and fears about being gay or bi, and i have aligned my spirituality, and not lying anymore to myself and to family, i want to work at getting back together with baby... and if not, at least i am already whole and ready to give wholly... complete.. without fear."

I therefore conclude it's bad for me to drive through san juan every morning on my way to the office.. blurry eyes can't see clearly... but driving itself reminds me of her... every little thing reminds me of her.. this tension up my throat hasn't loosened yet... im in the office now so i better steel myself.. gotta work.. but my heart needs time to mourn..

i need to mourn.. properly.. right now it comes in installments cuz life gets in the way.. i admire her for being strong yesterday... i want to be like that too... but i know i can't be strong without properly mourning my loss...

my loss.. my sadness stems from the things i won't get anymore... the intimacy, the getaways, the comfort of her... as my partner and lover... i need to mourn that... i need to mourn the loss of our friendship too coz it will take time before we become really just friends again

i am still so in love with her,  but i am in a needy and vulnerable place right now so i may not yet be thinking straight... being out of my comfort zone recently it is natural for me to want that back right away...

read her blog just now, it pains me too coz i wanted that getaway with her, i wanted a proper closure farewell where we can just cry in each others arms and re assure her she will never be alone, no matter what, as a friend or partner, i will be here... i want that too, i want to break down so i can pick up the pieces again... i need that... a proper good bye... 

but i guess everything has a purpose, breaking up right away when i know i need to evaluate how i love myself, which affects how i give and receive love...

i don't care if this is my need speaking.. i know im not in the best place to have a clear decision... but i want to spend time alone with her one last time before foraying again into singlehood..

or i can be strong. i remember her sharing this josh groban song.. you raise me up.. and now i think how applicable it is i dedicate that song to her.. you raise me up... i can move a mountain... you raise me up.. to be all that i can be..

this is the test for me, how unconditional i can get... without her beside me as my partner, no expectations.. if after a period of time my dependency has diminished and my love level is still the same.. then i know i am ready to give myself again wholly..

God, please give Karen and I the strength to realize our individual greatness as singles... prune me Oh Lord, shape me into a loving vessel capable of pouring to myself and then to others...

i need to be strong, but i am weak... i admit my weakness, so the Lord's strength may be magnified... I read in the Bible that men can prepare the chariots and the soldiers for battle, but only God can give the victory...

Lord please, enter my heart, only you can shed light to this emptiness I feel... shine on me.. shine on me..."

I miss her again
It's going to get worse
When you are on a break all you remember are the good stuff
All I remember is the love and the warmth
Who cares about issues, compatability and growth?
Are they really important?
Isn't love all that matters?

Maybe my emptiness doesn't come from my unsatisfaction with my relationship?
Maybe my emptiness is rooted in my search for fullness of life..
Spiritual, mental, emotional

Spiritually I'm parched
I get tp pray, devour God's word, try to understand there is one perfect love
Only from Him (or Her for that matter, I don't beleived in a gendered God)

Mentally, I'm okay, I get to use my braincells
Although I want to be challenged more
Get into more creative sojourns
Play the guitar again
Gathering dust in the corner of my room
Songs forgotten by fingers 
Dance on the strings again
Learn a new skill, do Tai-Chi?

Emotionally, I'm okay
I've been to colder places
Now I am somewhere warm
With shafts of sunsets
and occassional thunderstorms

Physically I am gathering flab
But my clothes still fit me
Only tighter in certain areas

So looking at it, there's nothing really major
Just a shard of unsatisfaction
I can work it out during the break
And find out the glass that gave birth to that shard"

She was in the airport and will be boarding Lufthansa round 7:40pm.  I said good bye, told her to have the time of her life, take advantage of the rare moments that she is an individual, the rare moments her mom is not beside her.

I told her to get hungry.  To taste what it is like to be your own individual, so that she will crave it all the more and finally assert herself, from differentiating her identity from her mom.

Not that she doesn't know who she is. She does. But I think she hasn't practiced being just herself for so long, always playing the role of dutiful daughter.  I can't imagine being at beck and call for someone 24/7, someone I live with.  I can't imagine being on call for my boss or even family in every minute of my everyday... that is just unhealthy.  

Anyway, for the first time her mom isn't shadowing her.  I suggested that she fly, literally and figuratively. 

I'm in the office right now, thinking of my own liberation. I can start with cleaning the physical and mental clutters in my mind, heart, and soul. Unattach myself, go deep, and find out what my heart wants.

During our break, I can dedicate my saturdays to creative writing, talk to people of different insights, go to an adoration chapel, run, skip, swim.. reconnect with friends, talk to adults, talk to kids, be with myself....

It is not so much the gayness that bothers me. No, that's not the point of the break. The point is my unsatisfaction, and I'm beginning to feel there are flawed compatabilities in areas I truly value:  passion to pursue one's life dreams.  Passion to be more.  Challenge. Passion to be an individual.  I don't want a soldier, a robot. It is the same thing I want for me. I don't want to become a soldier or a robot.

Once I have made my first investment and get my passive income rolling, I can quit my job to have that freedom."

But you're stuck
And now for the first time that leash is loosened
Go and explore Europe
I am certain your thoughts will be of me
As I am certain that my heart stings at the thought of letting you go

I have grown dependent on your steady stream
I wonder if I mistake my dependency for true love
All I know is I love you
But I also know I'm getting tired of waiting for you to fly

A chunk of our couple time is spent on waiting
I wait for you, you wait for me
Careful not to tread on each other

I want to stop being careful
And just declare to my parents that I am in love with you
Double X chromosomed like me
Be unapologetic when you kiss me at the mall
Not hide love from my eyes

When you get back
I don't know what to say
It just seems when you are going I find myself verbose

I love you
Please know that
It will not solve everything but that's not why I said it
I love you

"event","Come September 16 she and I will be celebrating our 2nd Year anniversary as a couple, but, there may be a chance we won't make it to that date as a couple.

For a while now, I keep feeling unsatisfaction.  Not in the way she loves me, or shows affection... but unsatisfied with our dynamics, our relationship in general.

She knows how to take care of me, how to surprise me and exceed my expectations in the affection and gifts department.. but our talks, our companionship... I keep looking for something that isn't there.

She can be deep, we laugh together, I can bare my soul to her, I trust her and she trusts me... but I don't feel the growth, the challenge, the mental and spiritual connection... there is the love connection and yes sometimes it is enough.. but I long for a vibrant, independent soul driven by her own passion, fueled by her own hopes and dreams.  She has been following orders for so long, have been used to not having privacy, her mom her only best friend.. I feel sometimes I am with a kid.

My growth to adulthood, it was different.  I haven't graduated officially yet, at age 21, when I first got a paycheck. From that day foreward I never asked money from my parents anymore, but they are free to give when they like it. From age 21 to my age now.. 28... I experienced the power of making it by myself, of being the one to give to parents, being the one to take care of them for a change... it changes you when you become an adult in that sense. I lost some jobs, applied for jobs, got rejected, got accepted, made real friends out of some co-workers I met along the way... Although I still live with my parents, I still call the shots where I go (especially now that I drive and have a car), I merely inform them where I am going but generally I own my time...

I need an adult.  Someone I can have long talks with, or short quality talks with. Someone who has experienced the liberation of making it on your own.  Some one I can spar with, intellectually and emotionally... A woman... A soul who has journeyed... Someone I can learn from...

I am learning from her too.  She shows in her acts the real meaning of love.  Sees it simply and is not theoretical about it, she acts on it.  I love that she can speak her mind, but I guess there are times I get impatient at the leash on her neck her Mum has on her.  

I am not perfect too. I still hide my relationship from my family, but even through the secrecy, I can still give me. I will also talk soon to people about spirituality and gayness. I am looking for mentors who will have no agenda (Converting me to a so-called ""right"" way is an agenda). I want a guru with no agenda who could somehow know where I'm coming from.

I pray to God for strength and clarity.  I love her, but she may not be the one I need."

I recently watched a shallow but fun film entitled D.E.B.S.  It didn't make any pretense that is profound from the beginning anyway, but what appealed to me was the core message of the movie of ""Being true to yourself.""

The main character, Amy, was a superb liar.  She was so good at it she was a top scorer for the entrance exams for the secret academy for spies.  What made Amy a great liar? She has denied to her friends, and to herself (for a long time), that she is attracted to girls.

But then, dashing Lucy Diamond sauntered into her life, and for once, Amy discovered the joy, and the cost, of being true to herself. Her bestfriend asked her to ditch Lucy and her school wants her to lie that she hase never been with Lucy. After all, Lucy Diamond was the most notorious thief the academy has been trying to capture.

So what did Amy choose? Between what she is good at (which is Lying) and what she loves (Lucy)? I guess the photo speaks for itself.

I wish I have the courage to be true to myself."

I thought her Mum was gonna tag along to our rendezvous, when I found that out I absolutely lost my appetite in going out... but fortunately, after a dozen last minute changes, she was able to shrug off her Mum.

Markikina streets are wide and clean, without the usual potholes and erosions metro manila roads usually have. In the cab I suggested a cool off, thinking that at least if we are not officially ""us"" I would not expect anything anymore, not need to be with her, not want her. It was a stupid suggestion in retrospect because cooling off wont help with the lowering the neediness. And besides, I couldn't stand seeing her hurt, in the cab, when I suggested the sort off break up.

I just came to a point that I dont know if our relationship is really ours, or for her Mum, to decide. I just want to put things in our own terms.

We did a lot of mending inside the motel room. I was obviously embarrassed, of being seen by people inside a motel wherein your mere patronage and presence suggests only one thing.. you went there to get shagged. or to shag. In one variation or another.

But beyond shagging, we were able to hold each other close, as if by the mere contact of our skins and whispers and re-affirmation of our love, all the bad prejudiced people who wants to pry us apart will melt away. I wish it is that simple, but at least my heart knows that we are both struggling, willing to fight, our weaknesses and the bad forces outside.

You know when you love a person, and are completely intimate with them, if you are able to sob your heart out in their arms without embarassment, laugh at them or with them without reservation, and tell them the ugliest thing about you and still feel perfectly loved.

"event","BAby, since you are taken away from me by your Mum. All I can really do is wait, and maybe hope that she'll change her percpetion. I researched in the Internet about how parents can come to terms with their children's sexual orientation. These materials I've found helpful:



<b>Sexual Orientation: Understanding Your Child's Homosexuality</b>

Few parents react to the news that their child is gay with complete acceptance and joy. Even parents who consider themselves open-minded may find themselves upset by the news. And parents who disapprove of homosexuality will likely find it even more difficult to accept their child's sexual orientation.

It's normal for you to be upset when you learn that your child is gay. You may find yourself worrying about his or her future or wondering what you've done ""wrong."" You may grieve for the possible loss of grandchildren or end to your family line. (It may help you to remember that homosexuality does not equal childlessness; recent years have seen a drastic increase in the number of children born to or adopted by gay people).

You're entitled to your feelings, of course. You're also entitled to share some of your concerns with your child. Just remember that your teen needs you now more than ever before. Gay teenagers account for about thirty per cent of teenage suicides - a figure that would probably be much lower if they received the support they so urgently need. Even if you have to struggle to do it, the best thing you can do for your gay teenager is to offer your love and support.

You may wonder what caused your child's homosexuality. Researchers used to believe that homosexuality stemmed from improper parenting, but this theory is now known to be false. As best we know, what ""causes"" homosexuality is the same as what causes heterosexuality: the roll of the genetic dice combined with prenatal hormonal influences. Today, the great majority of sex researchers and doctors view homosexuality not as a sexual problem but as a normal sexual variant, much as sea-green is a normal (if fairly unusual) eye colour.

What all this means is that your teenager is no more responsible for his or her homosexuality than heterosexual people are responsible for their heterosexuality. Homosexuality is not a ""lifestyle"" that teens choose to pursue, but rather a condition they discover in themselves. Studies have made it clear that, try as they might, the vast majority of gay teens are unable to change their sexual orientation. Even if they refrain from engaging in homosexual behaviours, the underlying feelings don't go away.

Trying to ""cure"" your child of homosexuality will likely produce nothing but frustration and misery on both sides. In the long run, you stand more to gain by accepting your child's sexual orientation as just one aspect of his or her unique makeup.

Support groups such as Parents, Families & Friends of Lesbians & Gays (pflag.ca) can help you to adjust to the new reality in your family. Such groups also give you the opportunity to advocate on behalf of homosexual teens, should you choose to take this step.

<i>Source : http://www.sexualityandu.ca/eng/parents/TS/sexualorientation.cfm</i>

====
<b>Why is my Child Gay?</b>
Parents often ask this question for a number of reasons: they may be grieving over losing an image of their child; they feel they did something wrong; they feel that someone ""led"" their child into homosexuality; or they wonder if there is a biological cause of homosexuality.

Some parents react with shock, denial and anger to the news that their child is gay. One response is to wonder, ""How could she do this to me?"" This is not a rational reaction, but it is a human response to pain.

We liken this reaction to a grieving process: here, you are grieving over losing an image of your child. As you work through your feelings, you may discover that the only thing your child has ""done"" to you is to trust that your relationship could grow as a result of you knowing the truth about him or her.

You may feel that your child has been led into homosexuality by someone else. It is a popular misconception that homosexuals ""recruit."" The truth is that no one ""made"" your child gay. He or she has most likely known that he or she was ""different"" for a very long time - no person or group of people ""converted"" your child.

Other parents believe or feel that their parenting is the cause of their child's sexual identity. For years, psychology and psychiatry have bandied around theories that homosexuality is caused by parental personality types - the dominant female, the weak male - or by the absence of same-gender role models. Those theories are no longer accepted within psychiatry and psychology, and many GLBT organizations are trying to erasing these myths and misconceptions from our popular culture.

Gay people come from all types of families. Some have dominant mothers, while others may have dominant fathers. Gay men, lesbians and bisexuals are only children and they're youngest, middle and oldest children. They come from families with siblings who are gay and families with siblings who are not gay. Many come from what society would consider ""model"" families.

Many parents wonder if there is a genetic or biological basis to homosexuality. While there are some studies on homosexuality and genetics, there are no conclusive studies to date on the ""cause"" of homosexuality. In the absence of this data, we would encourage you to ask yourself why it is important for you to know why.

Does support or love for your child rely on your ability to point to a cause? Do we ask heterosexual people to justify their sexuality that way? Remember that gay, lesbian and bisexual people exist in every walk of life, religion, nationality and racial background. Therefore, all gay people, like straight people, are very different and have come into their sexual identity in very different ways. Although we may be curious, it is really not that important to know why your child is gay in order to support and love him or her.

<b>Should we consult a psychiatrist or psychologist?</b>
Consulting a therapist in the hopes of changing your child's sexual orientation is pointless. Homosexuality is not a disease to be ""cured."" Homosexuality although not the norm, is normal for your child. Because homosexuality is not ""chosen,"" you cannot ""change your child's mind."" The American Psychological Association and the American Medical Association have taken the official position that it would be unethical to even try to change the sexual orientation of a gay person. In 1997, the American Psychological Association again publicly cautioned against so-called ""reparative therapy,"" also known as conversion therapy.

But there are situations where it can be helpful to consult people experienced with family issues and sexual orientation. You may want to talk to someone about your own feelings and how to work through them. You may feel that you and your child need help communicating clearly through this period. Or you may recognize that your child is unhappy and needs help with self-acceptance.

"event","<font style=Times New Roman><font size=4>Last night, I listened to her voice.  She gave me her MP3 player with her voice recordings on it, reading poetry of Pablo Neruda and Shakespeare. Can't say enough that she is such a cool chick. When she said ""I love you"" and ""I miss you"" in that sweet tender tone of hers, I cried. Because I don't know when I'll hear from her again. We've been banned. We've been pried apart. I'm starting to hate her Mum right now.  This is gonna be harder than I thought. I felt utterly powerless, our relationship was taken away by someone other than us. I mean, if we cool off or break up or do a self-imposed incommunicado, it is understandable if we are the ones who decided it. But noooo. This is her Mum's command.

Okay, okay. Just inhale, exhale. I'm trying to understand her Mum, but I soo hate her now. when I heard the songs you recorded ""Jeepney"" (<i>Naalala ko ang mga gabi, nakahiga sa ilalim ng kalawakan</i>) ""Broken Sonnet"" (I'll be by your side...and hey who says you're not the one?) and even Michelle Branch and the True song. The tears won't stop.

Again they are welling in my eyes right now in plain view of my officemates as I type this on my computer. Tears are a private matter. Good thing I have colds so I can pretend its just the cold. I am an empty shell without her laughter, her warmth, her smile, her arms, her talk about ""Doni Migili"" and other places she wants to go to, her calling me at 5PM reminding it's 5PM time to go.

I miss her so bad. And I'm sure she is just as sad as I am now. 

Everything reminds me of her. My breath. My empty arms, when I drive, when I hear any song with a mellow tune, the night, the silence...silence that used to calm me...silence now brings me the immensity of space without you.

If I knew that out Pampanga trip would be the last time I'd be seeing you in a long time, I wouldnt have dropped you off at your place. We could have gone somewhere.  I miss you. Is there a remedy? When I cant even call you when you are under surveillance?

WHat can I do? This prison your mom locked you in... can I open it? what can I do?

I know I just should wait, patiently. Agonzingly. Heartbreakingly.

Every moment is a moment bereft of you. Baby, when will I see you again? When will I hear from you again? Distant distant you.</font></font>"

"event","<font size=3>It has come to this, her Mum wants her to stop talking to me, I don't know if she also wants to stop us seeing each other. She took my Baby's cellphone so we won't be able to communicate for awhile. Well, there is always mental telepathy, the blog, the email, the land line..there are other ways for me and my Baby to still communicate.  It is just sad that our relationship has suddenly become contraband, forbidden-- well I already know that the societal norms and especially the Roman Catholic Church would think that our relationships is an abomination. Eve is supposed to go only with Adam and vice versa. It just so happens that Woman was made to be the perfect companion to everyhuman being - man or woman. Mother gives comfort, a girl best friend is a solace, why can't a woman be a companion to her own gender?

It's not as if we're getting married.  Being both bi, there is still a possibility we might find a cool bi-man, or an open-minded one, and reproduce and fullfill the dreams of our families of wearing a white bridal gown, take vows in the church, pass on our genes.

But thats not the point now. The point now is the now. She and I are in a relationship. And that's what her Mum is against about. It is frustrating that something that makes me and her happy is viewed as abnormal. We are not killers, abusers, or users but her Mum wants my baby to see a doctor. Geez. I thought the Dark Ages are over but apparently not.

Love that blooms in secret is harder to kill, it might have become a vine, growing and creeping surreptitiously until it is too thick to be tamed. Like I said in my email to her, Love is always good for the soul. I have high regard for maternal love but I don't think her Mum is coming from pure love, there is a lot of fear mixed there, fear of the unknown, fear that her child might get hurt.

But I also cant promise that sticking by me would guarantee her daughter's safety. But the same goes for all kinds of relationships.

I hope she is okay. Being the only one who lives with her Mum I can imagine the frosty atmosphere she has to live in day in and out.  I cannot hope that one day her Mum will understand, because it would just be crushing if I hoped and it didn't happen. Let's just say her Mum will never change her perception, then we would just have to continue like this...a twisted version of a Montague and Capulet... we'll just skip the drinking the sleeping potion part and committing suicide.

Love is good and understanding. I'll just try to anchor my judgement on love, and then I'll see her Mum in a bigger perspective...She's just a single parent who spent every day of her life giving to her kid, protecting her from harm...she doesnt see right now that is stamping out the happiness of her kid...that this will only make matters possibly darker.

I pray that understanding will both flow from one to another. Because there can be no acceptance without understanding.

Baby, if you read this, please now I'm sticking by you. We're not star-crossed. We can make our star's own path. For now, let the night blanket us in darkness, we'll shine still. When you come from love, you can never go wrong.  I understand where your Mum is coming from, and I'm working on accepting it. Accepting it doesnt mean I'll stop myself from seeing you or communicating with you. I'll just be more creative about it. ;-)

I saw Baby yesterday, she was wearing fresh mint baby tee that clung nicely to her body. She has the smoothest creamiest skin. I was meeting with a friend in McDo in Rob Galleria when she came bouncing into view (being well endowed, a few her parts bounced indeed) then we hugged (so soft!) and smacked (quick kiss) I was a bit worried that my sis might be close by, but what the heck, Baby's soft lips real warm.  She's so cute! :) Baby cute baby cute. :-)"

Nothing doing today. The boss aint here and there are only a few for action stuff in my in tray. I guess my longevity in a company would last to one year...max. I just want to travel, write, and help others discover their creative power. what kind of job is that?

A Nomad Guru? Imagine me in a dusty, weather-beaten travel cloak, a crooked walking staff, sandals, and a water-jug made of camel's skin slung over my shoulder? 

Hmmmm.  That's an idea.

Like I wrote in my PC, it's been a while since I felt connected to myself. The inner me that is free, careless, and tranquil. The babbling me is just the surface anxious van. Looking at life with a critical eye, observing patterns, mechanical hands that write for others.

flashback to this sappy song entitled..Never been to me. I'm all over the place. Scattered to pieces by the molds of jobs and roles I willingly stuffed myself into. And now I am free of one of those molds.  What does water look like when it has no container? What shape does water take when it is all by itself?

"event","let's talk about our obsessions. how it never leaves us, always at the back of our mind like a backdrop of a painting swirling around our heads, a black curtain billowing ominously, calling your attention, and at one moment or another you will. notice. plunge in back to that obsession.

I fancy myself as a level-headed person, slow to anger, and ponder things first before acting on it. I never thought of myself as capable of being obsessed with a person. but i was obsessed with a certain person before.  

I wasnt aware what a waking moment was but i know i was truly awake if Im thinking of that person. every frgament of space in my mind was occupied by thoughts, smile, hair, whisper, lousy corny jokes, inane coversations, discourses about life, our purpose.

but then it happened. i got over my obsession. like suddenly noticing the absence of a mole on my right shoulder.  I assumed it will always be there. but it disappeared. the process of vanishing, i do not know. what i know is you cant make your obsessions go away when you force it. it has its own process. and it will someday leave you."

"event","boss isn't here yet...fun! Yesterday it was a close shave, I was reading Willow/Tara fan fic, big window blown up and boom, boss is over my shoulder. Couldnt click the minimize button fast enough.

I'ts 8AM, the rain just stopped, contemplating maybe wether to fall again. I don't like JUne very much.  All the rain, flooded streets, water in my boots licking my feet cold and leptospyrosis.

But sometimes, I like June when it brings me hot cocoa, isaw, and all things barbecued and grilled. Oh, and Harry Potter movie and Spiderman 2. I like how the dementors were visually depicted. In writing, you have the liberty to go underneath the skin of the characters, peek inside their minds. How can you do that in a movie? How can you show the effect of dementors sucking out all the happiness in you?  The ""Azkaban"" movie was able to show this by showing frost, on the window, freezing a glass of water, foggy breaths.  What disappointed me in the movie however is the poor focus on Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. I think the central theme of Azkaban is Sirius Black, and his significance in Harry's life.  The acceptance of Harry that Sirius is innocent and that he never betrayed his parents was too quick. He was dead set to kill Sirius and a few exchanged words made him change his mind?

Anyway, gotta go back to work. Is there a job that pays for writing inane stuff? Oh yeah, tabloids. But I don't see myself turning in my resume to Abante or People's Tonight anytime soon. My job isn't creative. All of my past jobs have been in writing for magazines but I realized it doesn't pay much. So I settled for a happy medium-- a speech/pr writer for a Commission in the government. It's still writing, but it's technical. Nothing creative. Good thing with working for the government is the no-work on saturdays thing. I still get to free lance for magazines every now and then.  One of the models I interviewd yesterday commented on my article, well sorry dear if you dont think my write-up isn't accurate. But it is my perception of you. Sigh. Can never please anybody. If I make the profile too good, It sounds positevely saccharine- I would just retch. But that's what the editor is looking for so what am I supposed to do.

Damn. I've become an oxymoron. A creative cliche. Or a palindrome. Malevolent benevolent -- no thats a rhyme, not a palindrome.

Not making much sense. Bye journal!"

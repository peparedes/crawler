"event","In the great book that i finally finished reading (i was reading it very leisurely), Thoughts on Fire..., there is a very intriguing chapter about perfection. the chapter opens with a quote by W. Somerset Maugham, that states ""Perfection is a trifle dull. It is not the least of life's ironies that this, which we all aim at, is better not quite achieved."" With that said i would like to go on and quote the first part of the chapter, because this will make ppl realize that perfection will never be achieved.

""  The desire for perfection is one of the worst ideas anyone could have. It can be like a caustic acid that can destroy anything it comes into contact with. It can ruin your relationships, estrange you from your children and bring unhappiness to your work. Give up the idea of perfection my friends; it exists only in our minds. Some of the great philosophers, even people like Plato, were not immune to this disease. They imagined a realm of perfect forms that we should copy. Wrong, because once we have the idea there is such a thing as a perfect world, this world, the real world, ceases to shine. 
   
One problem with this approach is that it sets up an ideal of perfection that doesn't really exist. The whole concept of perfection bothers me. It's a goal of idea that can have a negative impact on a person's life if they're not careful. For instance, some of the more intelligent youngsters that i knew when i was in school thought that being smart meant they had to be perfect. To me, that is the worst way to look at the joys of school. I used to know a girl who was a straight-A student all throughout high school. When she got to college and she got a B-plus, it was a traumatic experience for her. Trying to do one's best is great; however, we are going too far when trying to be perfect makes us unhappy.
   
One of the worst ideas people could have is that they have to be perfect. Some people think that being perfect is their duty. They think that they should have a perfect marriage, perfect children, and perfect homes all the time. 
   
Well, we all know how things really work out in life. Our marriages aren't perfect, our houses aren't perfect and, heaven knows, our children aren't perfect. Then what happens to perfectionists? First, they get frustrated because they fail to reach their goals; next, they get angry; and then they get depressed. If they're not perfect and they think they should be, they see themselves as failures. They've set up their lives as a game where they're trapped. Once they define the alternatives as a perfection or failure, they can't win. If they  can't win, they can't be happy. The perfection game is a losing game. I've never known anybody who can beat the odds. 
   
That doesn't mean we can't be excellent in what we do. By excellence, I mean being the best we can be at any given time. A teacher should try to be the best teacher he can be; a butcher should try to be the best bucher in town; a painter should try to paint houses to the best of her ability. Martin Luther King once said to a street sweeper that he should 'sweep the streets like Michelangelo painted paintings.'"" (132/133)

I just thought that this was a very well written, and extremely true, passage from the book. If you couldn't tell the book is about 50% philosophy and 50% firefighter stories. overall it's pretty ""kickass"""

"event","ok so technically today was the last day of driver's ed. (and i think mr. Corace is VERY happy that it's over). i think everyone in my car had a great time. there were many great/interesting conversations which made the time fly. out of this class (aside from the discounts ... and practice driving) i have become friends with one person ... and i have learned who not to drive with (that just means that if i go anywhere with these/this ppl/person i will drive.....ESPECIALLY if they have been drinking!). other then that i really have nothing to say ... this class has been a great class and i hope everyone has had fun in our car."

"event","ok, so im going to attempt to answer a few questions that keep coming up. these are questions that cannot be answered completely with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. so here goes.

the biggest question is ""are u a 'real' firefighter now"" (after completing my FF1 class). the answer is this.... when i joined the MFFD i was a member. the night i was sworn in at the february meeting i became a ""member"" of the fire dept. i took what was called a 'rookie course' and became a ""rookie"" at the firehouse. after the course i was able to ride the ambulance as a 4th, and even as an attendant.... i had also become exterior certified. then i took firefighter 1. this class is the first (and biggest) step to becoming an interior firefighter. after completing this class i only have to take a 1 day firefighter survival class and i will be interior. i also have to take CBT. this is required to be taken every year to remain in the position u hold (interior, exterior, ...). u go to different stations around the fire house and have to perform tasks ... if u complete all the tasks required for ur position then u keep ur status .. if not u have to do them over until u can complete them successfully.

now moving on to another big question, ""why did u join the fire dept.?"" ... this answer i cannot tell u in a few sentences or even paragraphs. i will tell u that doing over 120 hrs of community service there for HS was part of the reason. another huge part of the reason i joined was b/c my brother and my cousin are members. (i can honestly say that if my brother wasn't a member i probably wouldn't be a member either). however that isn't the biggest part of the reason. there is a very good book that explains this a little better. if u really want to know the reason to y i joined and y i do what i do read the book 'Thoughts on Fire, Life Lessons of a Volunteer Firefighter' it is written by Dr. Frank McCluskey. he is a member of MFFD, as well as a dean at mercy college and he has a PHD in philosophy. this book will give u a good understanding to y people join fire depts., what goes on there, and what firefighters go through. what makes this book better (at least to me) is that it was written about MFFD and relates to the dept and some of the older members too."

"event","last night was the .... :::gasp::: ..... LAST NIGHT OF FIREFIGHTER 1 !!!!!!!
we had pretty bad results for our class though .... out of 12 ppl 5 failed, and 2 have to make up quizzes still. But i am one of 5 that passed and i also got a 100 on the final! neways afterwards we all decided to go to chili's for dinner. i rode there with Ari (a guy from class... the oldest person in the class at 35ish yrs old). he had his faster of the 2 lotus's that he owned (it's a lotus elise, his other is a lotus esprit). needless to say i thought i was gonna die b4 we got to chili's. he was making turns on stoneleigh ave. (and a few other roads on the way to chili's) at 120 mph. and he wasn't really even pushing the car! in the middle of stoneleigh ave he reassured me that i would not die b/c he had gone to a race car driver's school (and by the way he drove i wouldn't doubt it). now at 120 mph u would think that the car would be all over the road ... WRONG! the car didn't slide once the entire time, it was pretty much glued to the road. o and when i went to get into the car u literally had to climb to the ground to get in (i mean i've been in small sports cars b4 but this was the lowest). getting out was the exact opposite, u had to climb out. at chili's we all had a great time (we even told the ppl in back that it was charlie's b-day (the instructor), and they brought out a dessert thing for him. afterwards i rode back to the fire house with rob laprieno (sp?) in his ford escort. on the way there we hit 80 in his very crappy car, and hit a bump in one of the roads getting the car off the ground (not that much though). all in all i had an AMAZING last night of FF1 ... and now that it's over i can honestly say that i will miss the class (along with having a lot of free time now), and i hope that i will meet up with some of the ppl from the class, from other depts., at one point in my life. but that was definately THE BEST ending to a 3 month class (4/14/05 - 7/14/05) 2 days a week for ""3"" hrs a day (it ended up being MUCH LONGER)"

"event","ok so as you all know (at least u should) tonight is the first night of the fair at Mahopac's station 1. b3 the fair is always a parade (has been for like ever) ... something u probably don't know is that every year (usually minutes b4 stepoff) we get a big call in our district, and everything gets screwed up b/c some of the trucks have to leave (along with a lot of ppl) ... and of course we have to keep some there with ppl to march. well today was no exception.

at about 3:30ish a call came in for a car accident on secor rd. i was getting ready to leave when a second call came in. (i thought it was a second call for additional man power, however i was wrong)... the second set of tones was for a confirmed structure fire off of archer rd. so i grabbed my gear and went flying down secor rd (on my way to the firehouse .. to get on one of the trucks leaving for one of the accidents).
b4 i had gone 1/2 a mile secor i see a few volunteers going the opposite direction (going to the scene of the fire). a little farther down the road was the car accident with volunteers directing traffic. i found out they had everything under control, so i went straight to the fire house from there. on the corner of secor and 6N the attack truck past me going to the fire. i had noticed that other then the driver and ""officer"" of the truck there was only one other member on the truck and he had not yet been certified as interior. on the corner of 6N and the road by the fire house the tanker past me (idk what the name of that road is). so i go racing into the parking lot, and run to the rescue truck. when i got on i was surprised to see that there was only a driver and an ""officer"" on the truck (and the ""officer"" was only exterior certified). soon another exterior member would join me in the back of the rescue and off we went. (i had realized that we would have a problem with man power at the scene being as there were minimal interior members). 

we showed up to find a lot of ppl had driven straight to the scene and were extinguishing the fire (along with mutial aid from mahopac). we all helped out with whatever we could and eventually (after the fire was out) we were sent in for overhaul and salvage. we did what we could and went back to the fire house.

but the work was far from over. now at the fire house we had to get every truck back in service, as well as get some of the trucks ready for the parade. after all the work was over it was around 6:20 and ppl had started leaving for the parade. and to think the fire could've been MUCH MUCH worse. 

in the end we had successfully saved a house (escaping only minimal damage), and we dealt with the car accident ON TOP OF getting everything ready for the parade. had we gotten to the house a little later the entire house would've been on fire and everything would've been destroyed. 

this was my first structure fire and im glad it had a good end to it. i hope everyone that is going to the parade appreciates what a lot of members put into getting there as well as getting the trucks there. and i hope everyone attending the fair has a great time. that's all for now......."

"event","ok so i really have nothing to write about .. so i will just make a random entry about nothing and everything at the same time. this was the last full week of school and it is finally over ... two more days left and 4 regents away and we are done with 10th grade forever ... actually it's kinda weird if u think about it like that. also this year went by amazingly fast i can't believe it's over already. i have 2 more periods of spanish and a regents and then im done with that for the rest of my life (im really happy about that). firefighter 1 is also going pretty fast.... we have a midterm on tues ... and then we only have 8 more classes (the midterm is more then half way through the class). im glad im finally done with my CAD project ... it took countless hours after and outside of school to finish by the deadline (today) ... and i JUST made it ... however a lot of ppl didn't, i guess that's too bad .. they just didn't put any effort into it. wow, im really bored right now . NEways um .. today in chem we attempted to make ice cream ... we failed miserably ... but we did end up with pretty good milkshakes! so it wasn't a complete failure. in spanish we are taking a practice midterm ... that counts as a test (sounds like fun... not really). I finally succeeded in getting my first 100 on a global test the other day (but it was a take home test ... however some questions were still sorta tricky) ... lewis gave us a regents to do for hw today ... i think he's gonna grade that as a test too, but im not really sure. so far this week (tues and thurs) there were 2 car accidents at the bermuda triangle (in baldwin ... by stop and shop) ....both at crappy times right around FF1..... other than that i had two pretty strenuous days of FF1 this week ... but idk it's fun so i really don't mind .. and it's almost over so that's even better. the only thing that is gonna suk is we got the live burn day july 9th ... all day saturday (structure fires and car fires) ... so we are gonna like be dead... it's bad enough now i can't even imagine july how hot it's gonna be with 40 lbs of black insulated turnout gear and a 30 lb scott pack .... should be an interesting day. that's all for now i guess ... and that's definately enough randomness for the day ..."

"event","wow. there are so many negative thoughts going through my head it's unbelievable. right now i don't seem to have time for anything in my life ... and now that school requires more effort and time for tests and crap idk where i am gonna find more time. at the moment i seem pissed off at everything and nothing all at the same time. it's probably just the pressure of end of the yr tests, finals, regents, and FF1 tests along with skills ... all combined into one large amount of pressure that i can't seem to handle ... i just can't wait till summer ... it's only 7 strenuous days away + 4 regents exams. so lets's see what did i do this week ...

well last sunday i went to the firehouse in the morning (as i always do... it sorta turned into a 3rd day a week for FF1). so sunday we did hose line advance with an 1-3/4"" hose (which is what is normally used) and then with a 2-1/2"" hose (never used to advance .... at least not around here ... and is difficult to move with 3 ppl .. so u can just imagine how that went). afterwards i went to station 2 for the bar-beq-que (sp?) spent most of the day there with my brother (except for when we went out a few times to different places).... lots of events happened throughout the day ... sure was a fun time ... ended up getting home like 10:30 

mon .... i really don't even remember what i did but i know i wasn't home 

tues back in school (yay what fun) ... afterwards i stayed after for CAD .. came home did hw... then went to the fire house for a forcible entry lesson ... got home around 10:15

wed school ... was going to stay after but corace said he wasn't b/c he didn't feel good .. so i just went home. did hw ... went online for a lil while .. ate dinner...did a chem lab online with sam ... went to sleep like 10:30

thurs school ... hw... fire house for ladder/ventilation lesson... did ladder skills (charlie made my group hold the 35' 3 leaf extension ladder on our shoulders for like 20 min .. not fun) then we did leg locks and hung off the ladder ... overall the night wasn't too bad except charlie went over his scheduled time AGAIN and we didn't end until 11 (he has only ended the class on time ONCE all the other times were at least 20-30 min late .. if not later)

fri school ... had a math test despite the fact that snook wasn't even there .. i did horrible on it ... (i can't believe she teaches us standard deviation in one class period, gives us hw on it and the next day we have a test) ... basically if we didn't get the hw ... or didn't do it right then how are we supposed to do good on the test!?!?!?? now i am home having done most of my hw ... but i got a lot of english hw on Julius Caesar b/c ms. velez is a bitch ... and as u can tell i am in a pretty bad mood (however writing this did make me feel a lil better.)

that's all for now ... good luck to anyone and everyone taking the SAT 2's tomorrow (in any and all subjects)"

so on sunday i was at the fire house in the morning, as usual, and we got a mutual aid call to help out mahopac ... so the attack truck went to mahopac's station 1 and i along with the rescue truck went to the scene. we really didn't do much of nething b/c mahopac had the fire under control but they needed scott packs filled which was pretty much the only reason we were there... neways after that i had to go home and help my whole family clean and prepare the house for company (as my uncle was supposed to be comming over from washington state) ... ok i realized i already mentioned this so moving on ... well i ended up trying to sleep on a cot that we have (THE most uncomfortable thing EVER .. and i can sleep almost anywhere) ... then i settled for a recliner (my family is weird we don't have couches) ... and well  the recliner wasn't the best thing for my back .. that was also a pretty bad nights sleep....

mon after school i rushed to finish my hw and get ready to go to the wake ... not one of my favorite places to be. plus i don't agree with the whole 2 hr wake thing ... i mean ya to an extent it's good but it has almost nothing to do with the person that passes .. lettme explain. u walk into the funeral home ... say hi to everyone ... walk up to the dead body (which im not the most fond of) .. say ur prayers and good-byes and all ... and then it's like a social gathering. after that time everyone is talking about the past and all happy times and stuff ... i mean it's just wrong if u think about it .. ur not there to be happy and talk about good times ... but that's just how i feel. (it's pretty much an excuse to get as much family together as possible. afterwards my immediate family went out to dinner (at like 10) and i didn't get home till like 11 ..bad nights sleep ... NEWAYS moving on

tues i also rushed to finish hw (i had projects and essays and stuff to do too) then i went to the fire house for the last night of haz mat ops training ... (ppl said it was a lot worse than it really was). we ended up finishing early .. which was good b/c that was like the only good nights sleep i got all week so far.

wed stayed after for CAD ... a VERY unproductive after school session... all me and prazenka did was look in books trying to find what a fire pole looks like on a floor plan so we could piss off corace and put them in our house. well this was a somewhat easier day as i had nothin to do that night .. except an essay for global ... when i was finally done with all my work it was like 9:30 ... then i stayed up till like 10 .. my second good nights sleep for the week 

thurs was pretty bad ... i didn't have too much hw but i had to study b4 i went to the fire house b/c we where taking a test in fire fighter 1 ... when i got to fire house brian shay (officer shay of the carmel police...who has been in the dept and is now taking FF1 with me) told me we had 2 tests that night ... so i started freaking out b/c i only studied for one .. but as it turns out we only had one b/c NO ONE was prepared for the second one. then we started skills (we were at the carmel training center). my group started with ladders first. we had to carry ppl down them (they could not hold the ladder and their feet were hanging off the sides so they didn't assist the rescuer at all) ... of course i got stuck bringing down a kid from put. valley (that weighed 260 lbs... and another kid from our dept. that weighed 206... can u say fun?) .... after about an hour and a half of ladders we moved to the stokes station. (the stokes stretcher is that basket that they web ppl into and air lift ppl out of like mountains and boats and stuff). after learning how to web ppl in the stokes and how to make harnesses out of webbing (to drag ppl with) ... we went to switch to the building search and rescue part but we ran out of time ... so i guess that's for next time (or i think we are making it up on sun. im not sure) .. i got home COVERED in sweat at about 11:30ish took a shower, ate, and went to sleep at around 12ish totally exhausted ... and then fucking 6 hrs later my alarm clock went off im just laying in bed not being able to believe that i gotta get up ... but at least it was fri

o and can someone plz tell dan that what i did on thurs was more strenuous then IMing ppl online ... he claims using AIM is more tiring then lowering a 260 lb person down from a 2 story window ... ok dan keep dreaming ... thats all for now"

"event","well today was pretty good ... thinking back i don't really know what i did all day, but i know i wasn't home for most of it. however i was informed that due to the death of one of my great aunts (that i vaguely knew), a bunch of family from washington state are comming tomorrow night to take over my house for a while... this sounds like fun :( ... on top of that by tomorrow (whenever they arrive) i have to help clean up the entire house ... that's even more fun! yippi 

well other than that not much has happened that i can think to write in this. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what color i can change the dates, times, and links of my LJ to better correspond with the picture? (the orange just doesn't seem to work with the pic). that's all for now ... back to cleaning"

"event","ok i know kevin is goin to hate this, but for journal purposes i am goin to describe the call i went on yesterday in somewhat detail (i however will not release the names of the victims as i am not allowed to ... so either you know them and this story already or you don't). This was my first ambulance call since i joined the department (i've made other calls but this is the first i was able to make an ambulance call so i am making this entry). I will dedicate this entry to the three victims and the Mahopac Falls and Mahopac personal who responded...

I arrived at the Fire house at about 6:20 pm, for my Firefighter 1 course that started at 7 (i always get there early). After hanging out for a few minutes Brian Neary and myself decided to get chairs for the shed and set them up in the empty bay.(the third thurs of the month is the board of directors meeting so we have to have class downstairs). At about the exact moment that i took my first step the tones went off for a fire call (the beginning of the tones are different for fire and ambulance calls).

everyone went running to their turnout gear and proceded to get into it. then after the call was announced brian sacher puts his gear back throws his shoes back on and yells ""we need a crew!"" (as in an ambulance crew, b/c we just heard it was a car accident). so wo/ hesitating i run to the ambulance (as i know most ppl were in gear running to the rescue truck already. 

we pulled the ambulance out of the bay and awaited the rest of the crew (we only needed an EMT, but both laprienos were on their way) (that name is probably spelled wrong). the laprienos both show up and one gets on each ambulance ... along with bobby trace (an EMT) jumping on our ambulance. with this crew we leave. 

durring this time the paramedics were on scene along with mahopac's ambulance (mahopac may have come a little later im not totally sure).

On the way to the scene (on the corner of west lake drive and 6N) we see liz standing on the side of the road across the street from red mills. (shes a Lieutenant of one of the ambulances and most likely heard the call and ran across the street and waited for us to pick her up). we picked her up and continued to the scene. there was one person out of one of the cars laying on the ground (how she got there i have no idea) and the two drivers stayed in their cars ... one was already on oxygen, the other appeared fine. 

while the person on the grass laying down was put on a back board and collared and such i helped get the guy out of a white pickup that the front end was completely screwed up on (mostly the left side). he was collared, put on a back board and then onto the stretcher. he complained of his left arm hurting (possible fracture i suppose) he was put on mahopac's ambulance and off to the hospital they went. 

by this time the door to the black audi was extracated and they were starting to pull the girl out of the car and onto a backboard (she was collared and on oxygen still). i went with this victim onto the ambulance with the paramedics (she was in the worst condition out of the three and was being airlifted). we rushed to the school with the ambulance and assisted the helicopter crew getting her onto the helicopter and watched them take off. she complained of severe lower back pain and pain in her left leg (she could wiggle her toes... and i took the sign of pain as a good thing b/c im assuming that she isn't going to be paralysis). 

the person laying on the ground, at some point durring the trip to the HS, was taken to the hospital as well. 

from the looks of the scene one would guess that the white pickup was comming out of west lake turning right and the black audi going up 6N (towards the school). from this i incorrectly assumed that the pickup made a wide trun too fast into the other lane hitting the audi by the driver's side door. i later found out that the pickup was going down 6N (traveling straight and staying on 6N) while the audi was turning left out of west lake and was broad sided, both cars turning sideways to look like the scene we arrived at. in order for that to happen the pickup had to be speeding and was most likely still the cause of the accident. 

we returned to the fire house and took the course (we got there at 7:30 so we ended up staying late). there wasn't really anyone there at 7 b/c all the ppl in our dept in the course, were on the call. 

as for my emotions during this time ... they were unexpected and i will definately highlight most of them just for record purposes. i was looking forward to an easy night of haz mat when i left my house and arrived at the fire house. when the call came in it was unexpected and i (wanting to, but not wishing injury upon anyone ... just wanting to help when the time came) finally got to go on the ambulance. this had me anxious as well as nervious b/c i didn't know how bad the victim would be. (when i first jumped on the ambulance sacher said it was gonna be a bad call). that caused me to think ""great.. my first ambulance call ... a bad one"" when we got to the scene i was shocked b/c the drivers were both 16 yrs old, and i've seen them in school (i believe both are in junior yr). then the thought went through my mind that this could be me and that b4 they even knew what happened their cars were destroyed, spun around, and they were injured. i felt great that i was there helping .. but more bad that this happened and that it was possible to happen to anyone and there was no way to avoid it. i mean it's not like a fire call where a house burns down but everyone is alright ... this had worse results. i especially felt bad for the victims that i myself thought were innocent in this whole thing and should not have been hurt. However, you really wouldn't understand exactly how i felt if u weren't there (which u obviously weren't) b/c if u were there u would feel the same way. 

i would now just like to say that all the info that i supplied (concerning the victims future results) is not said to be completely accurate  b/c i only know how they were until they left the ambulances. this call will definately impact my life and hopefully who ever reads this will be changed for the better. and just so u know most of the time it is the other driver who is at fault and causes the accident .. but u are involved and have no control. 

I wish all the victims a complete recovery and hopefully they can return to their lives as normal when they recover. However i know that they will never forget this horrible time in their life and you shouldn't either. and i would also like to thank Mahopac's FD for mutual aid ... as well as Mahopac Falls FD for being there to help (as well as me being able to help through the FD)..."

"event","ok so this entry was suggested by kevin a while ago, and im finally getting around to it. i know it is gonna absolutely suck and not even come close to kevin's entry of the same topic, but that's ok. This is a list of 10 random people that have influenced my life (they are not in any order). they have not all been positive influences, but i guess u will figure that out when u read it.

Mike M. ... Mike (aka ""Mr. Smiley"" to melissa) is probably my best friend. He is in 9th grade right now. He lives and has lived down the street from me for literally ever. I've known him pretty much since he was born (only about 8 months after i was) and we've been friends since i can remember. He is the one person that i can without a doubt trust with ANYthing.

Mr. Gorey ... i don't think many people that read this will know him b/c he was my 5th grade teacher from Austin Road. My class was the last class to have him, as he retired right after. He was the first teacher i had that i considered the ""best"" teacher. He gave a lot of work at times, but there was lots of time for fun. Also i learned a lot of stuff that yr (on top of the useless required stuff, he taught a lot of interesting useful stuff) u really have to have had him to understand.

Kevin ... I met kevin in 7th grade. When i first met him i was told that he is this genius, and that he is the smartest kid in the grade (which is still true but the way i was presented with the information he was looked up to like a god). At first Kevin and i started off as average friends... and then he eventually told the entire grade that i liked meaghan molloy (that's a whole other story ... read the entry titled 7th grade for that one). Then somehow we became good friends again and he managed to screw up again by writing a letter to guidence saying i was gonna kill myself (that was bad). However even after all that kevin and i remain friends (despite the random arguments we get into sometimes ... but hopefully he doesn't take them seriously b/c i sure don't). 

Remie ... I met remie in 7th grade. He was and is one weird kid. He is constantly made fun of for his name (which is one name i would never name my kid) and seems to always be depressed about something. He was involved with the meaghan thing and many other things against me. Time after time i remained friends with him (even after everything he did to me). eventually he got mad at me for nothing .. so i decided that i didn't need his crap and wasn't gonna be his friend nemore. when he tried to be friends with me again i didn't allow it b/c i didn't need to be bothered with his crap nemore (he wasted all the sympathy i had for him). there is much more to this but again im not gettin into it now. Currently we are NOT friends.

Mickey ... I met mickey in 8th grade through erik lanza (also a cool kid but one that isn't mentioned in this ... as a lot of ppl aren't). Mickey and i became great friends and to this day are still good friends. His one weakness is his ability to not be mean to anyone. No matter what happens mickey will always be a nice person about it (especially when it comes to friends) ... kevin coined the term ""too nice syndrome"" for this (i believe that was what he called it). Overall mickey is an amazing person and i could probably write a book on him in the few years that i've known him, yes he is just THAT cool. 

Mr. Peterson ... I said b4 that Mr. Gorey was the first teacher that was the best teacher ... until 8th grade that is. Mr. Peterson was THE BEST teacher that i have ever had thus far. Mr. Peterson did NOT believe in busy work. If he gave work there was a reason for it. His tests were hard (not that i did bad on them, b/c i didn't, but they were hard) ... however the reason for this was to make the regents an absolute joke. How many teachers do u know that can stand up and say (during the moving up ceremony from 8th to 9th) that the avg regents grade for his students that yr was a 95. something???? not any that i can think of offhand. He was a great teacher and taught us ONLY what we needed to know, along with giving us the best preparation for the regents. Overall THE BEST teacher i had (and probably will ever have)

Dan ... Ok so i'm not exactly when i first met dan. However, in 9th grade i becam good friends with him again (but i did know him from the past). Dan was in my 1st period design and drawing class last yr... as well as my math class (mr. scheinder is amazing). This yr dan is in my CAD 2 class (which is just as good, if not better than design and drawing last yr) .. and i really don't even mean the class when i say that. there is soo many inside jokes and such in that class it's amazing. Overall dan is a great friend and hopefully he will be in many more of my classes. (btw the 5 hr course would've sucked wo/ dan there .... it was just soooo BORING!)

Mr. Connick ... Ok, many ppl feel different about mr connick as a teacher. the one argument that is almost always made is ""he's soo boring"". while this is true he does teach (some) of the required information. He gives u the questions to the quiz the day b4 the quiz (to make up for the fact that he didn't get to about 75% of it). Also his tests were not really too bad. They progressively got shorter towards the end of the yr. The good thing about mr. connick is, he is one of those teachers that will do anything for his students (the good ones ... and even the bad ones i suppose). he might not be the best person, but he is a great person.

Melissa ... I met melissa in 9th grade (through a friend of mine .. at the time not now.. see above ppl to figure it out). Melissa and i became pretty good friends from the start (despite the age difference). after her and the above fuck-up stopped being friends, she stopped using aim for a while (b/c ""HE"" was stalking her) and i lost touch with her. This past Jan. she came back to AIM to wish me a happy birthday (on the wrong day .. but i gotta give it to her b/c she remembered my b-day was in jan...that's better then MOST ppl). Overall melissa is another really great friend.

??? ... ok this person (as u could've guessed) i will not name. I met this person in 7th, but never offically met her until 8th (she was in one of my classes in 7th but i didn't ""recognise"" her ... and we never talked or became friends or nething). In the summer between 7th and 8th grade, i began to like this person (i had stopped liking meaghan towards the end of 7th.. not that it matters). It was and still is strange y i liked this person b/c i really didn't know her at all and it wasn't b/c of her looks b/c i never really noticed her. In 8th grade she was in a few of my classes and i really started to like her. 9th she was in one of my classes (i think). and now she is in a few of them. over the yrs i have gotten to know her more (still not that much) and i like her even more now. and i can always say one thing about this girl (well more then one but ...) she is THE NICEST person i have ever met in my life, and i don't think anyone else even comes close. She has a great personality, she's nice, she is BEAUTIFUL ... and is just amazing at that ...
(just for the record ... i am not in anyway, shape, or form ""obsessed"" with this person) ... as i haven't been with anyone although ppl made it seem that way at times

If anyone thinks they know who the above person is DO NOT comment with her name... just don't say anything (this is not a guessing game nor should it be ... don't even bother guessing b/c i will NOT tell u who i like)

this is a random list of ppl that have influenced me (although now i realize that i really didn't put examples of how they actually influenced me or anything of the sort) ... these are not the only people that have influenced me as there are many more ppl ... but this is just a random list of 10 ppl that did .... that's all for now i guess"

"event","ok so im bored as hell right now and i NEED something to take my mind off of hw (actually i need something to keep my mind on hw b/c i keep getting very easily distracted from it) ... right now im attempting to read this like 5 pg paper thing on Michael Collins and it doesn't really make sense to me which sux b/c i gotta write a 1 pg paper summarizing it when im done ... but like every paragrapgh is about something completely different. on top of that i gotta write 2 100 word spanish essays (b/c the cool/gay sub we had yesterday didn't give us the work so now i got twice the amount of work to do :( ) ... anyway i got enducted into the NHS yesterday ... a lot of ppl didn't get in (sux to be them) .. idk it doesn't seem like such a big deal to me. (i was astonished when i saw that ppl that had amazing grades and that were really smart couldn't lite the candles wo/ them going out ...weird). neways as soon as the enduction was over i ran out of the school and got dropped off at the fire house to stay until 10 for a Firefighter 1 class (i was 40 min late but i still got credit for being there so i don't have to make it up .. which is good) ... after school today i stayed for the big drivers ed lotto (ok so not big but...) ... 42 ppl wanted to get in only 32 spots ... i was called 3rd from last ... so im glad about that. kevin, dan, amanda v., and a bunch of other ppl got in that i know so that was good. in spanish today amanda told me that she wasn't taking APBio next yr ... so now idk what im gonna do as far as my schedual goes ... i think im gonna replace that with principles of engineering and possibly AP Stats (is anyone taking AP Stats next yr?... is it a good class?). other than that i got a lot going through my mind ... along with not having time to do nething nemore ... things are just too hectic. that's all for now .. i think that was the most random paragraph i've ever written in my life, o well..."

"event","ok so i haven't updated in a while ... and i really have nothing to say. so i will just inform u that ur (some of u guys) amazing fire dept. has decided to make a video/commercial about drunk driving and such. we filmed it today (and honestly i have no idea how it's gonna come out) but it was fun to do. we enacted (we faked it .. but only for the first time .. so i guess enacted works there?) a 2 car pile-up. one car rolled onto it's side the other was hit in the passenger's side. that's pretty much all i will say for now (i was in the video ... if neone can find me .. or neone else that would be cool) hopefully it'll turn out good. i think it will be on like channel 8 or sometin like that, if/when i find out i'll be sure to let u all know (not that any of u care). On another note i can't believe we have school tomorrow (those snow days were a complete waste). the next 2 days of school are gonna suk. that's all for now"

"event","ok so yesterday was basically just a really crappy day. i went the school .. enough said there. then i went to corace's class to get my drawings (to work on at home.. as he wasn't staying after). so i get home (after a nice ride on the bus sitting w/melissa .. who is THE coolest person on my bus) and after doin sum stuff i sit down to my literally TONS of hw. the spanish didn't take as long as i thought it would, the global took longer as i couldn't find much info on yugoslavia, and then dun dun DUN math hw. it literally took me about 2 hrs to do that fucking hw ... assigned by the devil herself (mrs. snook if u couldn't have guessed) ... she is the WORST teacher i've ever met when it comes to assigning ""busy"" work. after that i worked on my house design project. (about 1 hr in class would've equalled the 2-3 hrs that i put in at home) it's just soooo much easier to draw IN class wit all the proper tools and untensials ... neways .. now i am gonna start enjoying my weekend as all my hw is done (including the global, snooks hw, AND the 3 english projects/assignments) .. so that's good"

"event","ok i know im a day behind but yesterday was my brother's 20th birthday so i couldn't update. however yesterday i had an amazing day, and i felt better than i have in a long time on a school day. so here is what happened;
i went to global and nothin really happened 

then i went to the office/eventually mr. diciccio's room (read my comment in dan's lj to understand) and he talked to me for literally 35 min (i got to CAD wit 5 min left in the period) but basically he told me that it was my decision to go into intro to BC math, but that i was the second most qualified person on his list (only to rebecca meli) and that if i didn't decide to enter the class he would start his ""sales pitch"" the next time he met with me. (he was basically already doin a sales pitch neways) im pretty sure that i am gonna take the class...
i went to CAD give corace the note and he looked like he was gonna kill me so i walk away and everyone tells me they thought i was cutting. so then im like that would be stupid being as how i've never missed a class b4 AND i wasn't gonna finish the project by fri neways

then i went to health and we went to the computer lab to work on our article summaries (which i had already finished the night b4) so mr. rode let me work on other stuff... so i started the process of combining 3 sets of questions into 1 for the global project

eng we read Night ... that was pretty much it (today she yelled at us b/c she finally realized that only about 4 ppl are really reading the book (out of a class of 18)

math we continued to do graphs of sin, cos and such (easy stuff)

chem (2 very long periods) of lecture (im not even exactly sure what we are doin) and i know aniket is gonna fail the next test b/c he didn't take notes on nething for the last few days (including today)

span .. we really didn't do nething. she went over the quiz (which i gladly got an 83 on) i can't wait till next yr when i no longer have to take this stupid class 

on the way home i realized (almost home) that i was supposed to stay after for CAD as i will never finish the project but o well, then i went home did hw, wrapped my brothers birthday present, talked to melissa, ate dinner, talked to melissa, took a shower, celebrated my brothers b-day, and then ALMOST forgot house, so i came online and talked to melissa while watching it (the usual tues night thing) ...not everything happened in that order but that's pretty much what i did ... and i was in a great mood for sum reason (but im not gonna question y .. im just glad i was)"

"event","yesterday i felt horrible after school .. i felt like a terrible failure and depressed and all. on the bus melissa sat in the back .. YAY! (mainly b/c there was an empty seat there and her friend emily was goin over her house .. but that is not important) ... melissa made me feel better (for the time being) as hanging out with her got my mind off of things for a lil while, which was great. then i got home felt worse and began my hw (not immediately .. but nothin happened worth mentioning b4 that so...). i got a msg from melissa saying that she wasn't gonna be home ... and therefore wasn't gonna be online till really late so with the whole night ahead of me i decided to hang out with my brother for a lil while when he came home from work. i worked a lil on my english paper and then a lil on my global project (not that i think we are meeting b4 the project b/c we were supposed to tomorrow BUT no one told me nething .. and idk where neone but joachim lives). then to give myself a lil more backround on the topic of Khmer Rouge, i watched the movie ""The Killing Fields"" it was boring at parts and a LOT different than i thought it would be. it gave me a lil info on the subject but not as much as i had planned (although i did know about it b4 b/c i have been researching it) .. neways today i didn't do much .. i hate the rain.. and it figures it's nice all week and then on the weekend its gonna rain the entire time !!.. and this comming week is supposed to be nice (although next weekend it'll probably rain. Melissa finally got back from her barmitzfa (yes i know i am incapable of spelling that) at 3:15 ish .. although she said she would aim for 1 and the latest being 3 .. i guess her aim is a lil off .. o well .. at least she's back now .. but im still kinda bored :/ ...that's all for now"

EVERYTHING .. and they are not turning out good .... idk i need time off away from school ... and i don't think i can wait 2 more fuckin weeks! ...o and 2 days .. b/c now instead of a vacation we have a fucking long weekend .... that's a topic for another day though ...that's all for now .."

"event","since ""sumone"" doesn't wanna hear nething about the FD i will post B4 i go rather than after (this way there is no chance of that happening)
so today was a seemingly good day. 

global we didn't do much (although we have a project due sumtime next week, and my group doesn't seem to have time to meet and get it done. 

CAD2 ... wow what a shock .. the 3 floor plans are due next fri .. im not even close to finishing them .. but not too many ppl (that means im gonna have to stay after next week :(

health we had a test... I GOT A 100!!! (maybe that'll bring up my grade b/c the last test i got a fuckin 80 on :( ....but i got a 100 on this one so it's all good)

eng.. we are in the process of writing our research papers AND reading Night .. it would've been faster and easier to do one at a time .. but u can't tell ms. velez that .. neways the paper is due on mon ... i am probably one of the only ppl that will finish it in time 

math ... mrs. snook goes over the HW .. assigns us LOTS more for tonight .. we have a test tomorrow (no calculators allowed :(
between math and chem i saw meaghan in the halls (actually on my way into chem) .. i felt bad though b/c i was sorta in a bad mood and was unenthusiastic b/c i just got a ton of math hw and was not at all looking forward to the lab i was about to do on my own... ooo and i saw kevin in the halls b4 that .. and HE ACTUALLY SAID ""hi"" .. im so proud .. b4 all he did was smile ... i mean he didn't say it loud or nething .. but's it's an improvement ... CONGRATULATIONS KEVIN!

chem we went over the HW ... then started a lab (we aren't even near the end of it) .. and all aniket was supposed to do was get the damn chemicals ... and he couldn't even do that right ... then revenson began yelling at me .... WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ... i can't do the ENTIRE thing by myself ... i mean god all aniket had to do was measure out 2 amounts of chemicals for each trial .. i did the fuckin rest!!!! ...also i have a test tomorrow in chem .. and i better do good b/c the last test and quiz didn't go so well

then spanish .. omg i hate my new seat .. not only am i next to sumone that doesn't know what they are doin (that makes 2 of us) .. (btw it's martin) ... but im in a seat with a perfect view of the clock .. so the entire period all i do is watch the second hand go around .. then i get called on say idk (b/c i have no idea what we are doin) and i continue to look at the clock (this makes the period seem to last FOREVER!!!! .. on top of which they added an extra 4 min to 8th period b/c they don't say the announcements until AFTER the bell now.... 

that was my day .. i was fine until chem, when everything seemed to be happening at once ...other than that idk it wasn't bad .. i can't wait till next yr though when i don't have spanish ne more :) ...and now looking back .. it seems like i have a lot of things due next week .. i better get it all done :( ....but now that the day (school day**) is over .. and im done wit my hw im happy .. now im just waiting to go to the fire house tonight for the drill (hose line advance) .. sure to fun .. but im gonna be dead tired tomorrow"

"event","ok so yesterday i got pretty pissed off (as u will see from the previous entry) and i made a decision that i am gonna stick with .. and that is that i will not use aim for the next few days (i'll most likely be on again thurs night .. for most of it) that is if ne one cares to talk to me ...... neways i did actually have sumtin that i was gonna say but now i can't even think of what it was so .. i guess i'll forget about that. also i am really upset about global b/c now we have a test on thurs ... and that upsets me b/c i am not home on wed. to study for it (this is the second time mr. lewis did this) ... on top of which no matter how hard i study for that fuckin class i still cant do good :( ....i've actually given up all hope on that class so w/e ..... i really should get bak to my hw so ... i guess i'll talk to everyone on thursday ... or in school tomorrow or w/e .... cya then"

"event","ok so today was great ...UNTIL .. fuckin 12ish ... from there it went down hill ... first off i am just totally pissed b/c i NEEDED to talk to melissa about sumtin really important (in my mind neways) .. and when she finally comes on long enough to talk to i get this 
""Melissa: i just cant stay here anymore. it isn't your fault..i just hope you all work out but i just cant help chad (though I have no idea wtf is going on anyway) right now, my day was too great to be ruined now."" then she immediatly logs off
this royally pisses me off even MORE b/c i've been trying to talk to her all day and when i finally get a chance chad says sumtin to her to make her leave. 
so then i go and talk to chad .. after a min i get him tellin me that he want to die (again) and that he has already ""accidently"" cut himself (those were his EXACT words)..... this brings me to another level (beyond pissed) and i didn't even know what to say .. so i just logged off in the middle of a sentence 
this event will probably cause me to just stop using aim .. at least for the time being, b/c it's only making things worse .. so unless u talk to me through LJ or sum other such thing .. u may not hear from me online for a while........"

"event","so yesterday after school (and hw) i went online for a lil while ... melissa was about to get ready for her play (which she was amazing in) and then she left. i was sorta bored after that .. i did sum random stuff then i came bak online at about 8:15 only to discover that mickey was online and had not gone to botb. so i talked to mickey for a lil while and he went off to drum and i went to watch a movie. at about 11ish (after i finished watching Backdraft .. a good movie) i came bak on only to discover that melissa had gotta forced to leave botb early (right after frank albon's band ...sry if i spelled that wrong) and i talked to her for a lil while... soon she said she was tired and had to go so i continued to talk to frank fierro for a lil and then i left. 
that was one pretty boring night (i mean it's not like nething else i could've done would've been better, b/c i hear botb sukked ... so idk"

"event","ok so i told kevin no more of these entries (but my life is boring other than this stuff) AND it's different this time. this wednesday we went to the carmel training center (aka the burn center or the tower) originally the drill was supposed to be ladders and mask confidence but they added a lil more to it. 

at about 7:10 we left the fire dept on the rescue and one ambulance (there was about 30 ppl and there definately wasn't enough room for them all between the 2 trucks. on the way there this kid (a rookie) jim fatone (was standing in the rescue as he was one of the ppl that didn't have a seat) and he almost fell but instead sat on another rookies helmet and cracked the sheild in half (if u know jim u know he lives up to his name of ""FAT ONE"") 

so when we got to the training center they told us to go to the meeting room (i guess that's what it was) and we soon found out that we had a very LARGE group of ppl (bout 27 not counting officers or senior members)... they told us there will be 4 stations; mask confidence, 35' ladder, roof ladder, and inital attack. so they gave us all numbers and split us up into 5 groups.

the first station my group did was the 35' ladder. (lettme just say this ladder is 35' long, has 3 leafs and weighs in excess of 200 lbs.) we placed the ladder up to the 3rd story of the tower and ppl climbed it with a pipe pole. once at the top u had to check for footing get off the ladder (onto the floor), then get back onto the ladder, do a ""leg lock"" (which is where u lock ur legs around the ladder, let go wit ur hands and lean back). after that u climb back down the ladder and ur part is pretty much over. between getting the ladder up, doin that part of the drill and putting the ladder back down .. i think my group did a good job. (just so u know all this was done in full turn out gear w/ scott packs)

the next station we did was the roof ladder station. this ladder was much much easier to maneuver (as it was much lighter and shorter) we placed the ladder on the second story (by a window simulation thing). one person would go up the ladder as the rescuer and some one would go up right behind him as a ""balancer"". the victim would be handed out the window by 2 other ppl already up there and the rescuer would carry him down the ladder. (it was more like sliding him down .. hard to explain) ... everyone had the chance to be the victim and the rescuer. (this was done with full turnout gear as well)

the next station we were assigned to was inital attack. this was based on a basement fire. so of course i was picked to be on the nosal. we went down a ramp, into a room (with furniture), then around a little bit, and eventually came to a set of stairs, went down the stairs ""put out the fire"" and went back. at the end the cheif handed everyone a piece of the hose wit the coupling and asked the ppl to find the way out (if u picked the wrong way to go based on the coupling, u were ""dead"" if u picked the right way to go then u can go back to the truck). o and did i mention this entire thing was done with our fire hoods on backwards, so we couldn't see NETHING (as well as the room being pitch black so that didn't help). we did it in full turnout gear on our hands and knees. and on side note, noone chose the wrong way to go based on the coupling.

now the last station was mask confidence. my group did not get to do it (as we were short on time and had to go back) but i will just describe it here neways. in full turn out gear, w/ scott pack and hood over ur scott mask (so u can't see nething). u basically had to go through an opstical course wo/seeing nething. there are parts where u have to take off the scott pack and slide it in front of u while u go under an 18"" high wall. (in that part ur helmet also had to come off b/c it doesn't fit through). ur scott pack also has to come off a few other times when u go through a wall wit 16"" beams. throughout the entire course u gotta follow a hose that goes through the whole thing.

after that we went back to the fire house, cleaned the 2 trucks that we used, washed the hoses off, and that was the end of the night. (in not too much detail)
overall the night was really fun (even though i didn't get much sleep) and im really looking forward to the live burn we are gonna have there in april sumtime"

"event","kevin i know i said no more vfd entries .. but this is different (well a lil) .. i will not go into detail on ne of it for the sake of the ppl that are not interested.....
when i first got there this morning i helped brian neary and james guilligan check 19-2-1 (the source truck)... then we (along with other ppl) re-racked most of the hose on the truck ... after that we just set up tables and moved chairs around and stuff ..
we ended up in the engine room waiting to leave for the parade (there was a lot of talk bout getting a call right b4 the parade ..b/c that's happened b4) .. well we got on the trucks to leave for the parade and surely enough a car accident call came in...... there was about 10 ppl on the rescue truck that all got pulled off to go on the 2 ambulances and to form a stand-by crew on the source truck for the parade (just in case there were ne other calls) ... i ended up gearing down and waiting on the rescue for more ppl goin to the parade
we got to the parade and got the trucks ready and all and we soon realized that me and my cousin were the only ones that were gonna actually walk .. so we're like ""screw that"" and jumped on the back of the source truck (literally we were stand on the back platform through the whole parade) ... (during which there was another ambulance call.
we left the parade and went back to the fire house .. as soon as i put my gear in my gear bag (and im not kidding ...literally as soon as i zipped up the bag the tones went off for a fire call)...
so the attack truck leaves wit 4 interior firefighters on it (including my brother) .. and the rescue leaves wit 4 rookies on it (a lil weird) ....when we got to the call they told us to stand down and we really didnt get to do nething (""damn""...the second call of the day that i didn't get to do nething) ...
after that we went back to the fire house (yet again) washed the trucks... then we went upstairs for a corn beef and cabbage dinner ... and i came home  
don't ask me y but right now i am completely exhausted but i had a great day (this isn't every detail .. i was trying to keep it short .. and it kinda got longer then i wanted it to ...but o well...i can't fix it now)"

"event","ok so tonight was illusion 2005 ... if u didn't go either tonight or yesterday ... then GO TOMORROW ... u don't know what ur missing! .... i wanna start by congratulating EVERYONE that took part in Illusion in the music end of it ... u were all amazing (sum more than others but ... NEWAYS)... highlights of the night would have to be the bass solo (bringing back old memories of nintendo with the mario theme songs in there) ... the drum solo (that seemed to last forever b/c of the bassist ben ... and the guitarist tom goin to mcdonalds, playin pool, batheing in a hot tub... and so on) .. the glow in the dark drum sticks were insane (i was really just waiting for him to break one) ... other highlights include ...WELL THE WHOLE FUCKIN SHOW .. like i said b4 if u didn't go yet GO TOMORROW! (o and the beat box kid Carlos) that was insane ... 
as wrong as it was i still can't believe they shut the power off on erik lawton and everyone playing enter sandman at the end (i know they weren't supposed to be playing but ... it's a good fuckin song) .. neways i had a great time with melissa, emily, and jaclyn (when melissa and emily weren't spazzing out .. now do u see what tooo much sugar does to u kevin?) ... neway good times were had for all (is that how that's supposed to be said?!?!?!) i still can't hear outa my left ear (the hearing in my right ear was restored though :) ... (my advice .. i strongly recommend that if u go .. get a seat in the middle!.. i cannot stress that enough) and if u didn't go u better tomorrow .....
o and if u want a better story of the events of tonight go to kevin's LJ and read his entry on the subject ... he had a notebook so it's A LOT more detailed than mine (at least that's what im guessing)
my favorite songs of the night (well the ones i remembered neways) ...not including solos and the beat boxing 

burn burn - erik lawton (ok so it brought bak sum bad memories of sumone .. but it was good)
American Idiot - also by erik (although i thought he sung it better at the kick off the break concert)
Destroy the map - erik and pat (prob my favorite song of the night) 
since you've been gone - gina (contrary to what kevin says).. i felt this was a great performance
Enter sandman - erik lawton (even though he only played half b4 they shut him down i sung the rest of it 
                to myself so it's all good :)
Down - (im not sure who sung it but 311 is amazing)
Lose my breath - (this was in part b/c mickey and ritesh were on the marching band drums) ... mickey it's 
                 ok ... but yes u did go a lil longer than i think u were supposed to :)"

"event","ok i will start this entry by first saying that this is the last of the VFD entries ... and i will cut that short and just say that today i got my turn out gear ... and soon i start fire fighter one .. so yay for me
___________________________________________________________________________________

Now i will devote the rest of this entry to one of my best friends .... MELISSA!!!

if u have read the last entry (titled ""Weird Mood"" .... u will sorta understand how i felt yesterday (u won't exactly understand it ... b/c i didn't and therefore i couldn't describe it the greatest) ...BUT it was terrible ... and within 30 min of melissa being online i felt great (i couldn't believe it) ... 
i have helped many ppl with their hard times and problems but i myself have never had any really bad ones... until yesterday where i couldn't confide in ne one b/c idk it just wasn't working 
the one person that made it worse was megan (no not meAgHan ... megan ... and if u don't know who im talkin bout it's too bad b/c im not explaining) .... well i mean it was kinda my fault (so im gonna admit that) ...i did say sumtin to her that i shouldn't have (and i am very very sry) .. but she reacted in a totally wrong way and wo/ realizing what was happening i think we become un friended .. that made me even MORE upset ... then that whole thing just went away as she still wanted to be friends wit me ... =)  
sry i went off on a tangent .. back to MELISSA! well neway im not sure what she did to help ...but it worked .... (i've kinda run outa things to say as of now so i will conclude with..) MELISSA I LOVE YOU!!! 
(once again if u get the wrong idea read the comment i made in last entry for clarification)"

"event","idk where this came from but today i am in a weird mood. it's not like depression (b/c im definately not depressed), and it's not completely like a mood of deep thought, and im confused as hell, along with boredom. these things combined makes a pretty weird overall feeling... i must use a quote from an amazing person to describe how i feel at this moment .....

""Oh and yeah so I don't get this one thing that might be happening, but I don't know if it is and seems weird to me because it's like from two different parts of my life that seem to collide that I want to do something about but never will and get mad when something does but still won't do anything because I'm too scared and lazy and dumb. But yeah and also then the other thing that I don't really know why or how it is becoming something again but it's probably not because I know it can't because it's not really something that actually can so actually I'm not worried about it and I wouldn't really care if it did, but I mean I guess I would deep down but I don't want to admit it to myself, or anyone else for that matter, but obviously I'm somewhat aware of it because I'm talking about it right here, even though none of you probably have any friggin idea what the hell I'm talking about and even if you think you do, you probably don't.""

this is how i feel right now ... so yeah .. and mickey was right in saying ""And that was one mother fucker of a run-on sentence"""

"event","ok so the last debate was supposed to go the other way ... but now i have another angle to put into this ... ppl are confusing minority nationalities with minority looks .... so i will open up the debate again (that was the My nationalities debate on Friday, February 25th) ... i would not like u to comment on nething that has to do with looks at all (yes even i know anniket LOOKS a lot different than most ppl but that doesn't make him a minority!!!) ... and i am also not interested in ur own nationalities (prazenka)... i am looking for ur side of the debate based purely on nationalities .... (and keep in mind that in the last part of this debate there were TWO ppl that commented with indian backrounds .. and there are other ppl in the school with indian backrounds too .. 3 that i know of for sure .... but there is most likely more than that) ...now i ask u ... how many ppl with armenian backrounds do u know? ...(mr. lewis himself said he didn't know ne so how bout u ??)"

"event","ok as i have been threatened to remain with LJ ... i have taken it into consideration ... through deep thought and meditation (not really ...but it sounded good) ... i have decided to give LiveJournal another chance ... 
on another note i just finished my math hw for today AND tomorrow (that was a lot ... especially since i didn't know what we were doin tomorrow so i had to use the text book the best that i could)...i had to do this b/c Mrs. fuckfacevelez is forcing me to go to an assembly 4th and 5th period tomorrow .. and miss sumtin very important in math (besides mrs. snook wasn't happy when i told her i wasn't gonna be there tomorrow) ... well the assembly is supposed to be sumone coming in to talk bout the Halocaust b/c she was involved in it ... ok so really i mean it wouldn't be bad or nething but we don't NEED to go to it b4 we read Night ... idk the honors class had to read the 109 pg book over the break ... it will surely take my stupid class at LEAST a month to read it ... o well ... tonight i get to go to the fire house for yet another night of the rookie course ... noone will know what we are doin until we get there (actually not till we start doin sumtin)... but at least now i can go on sum calls ... (after Sun i can offically ride on the ambulance as a 4th ... if that means NEthing to u) ...
Yesterday chad freaked out everyone by saying that he is gonna die (his chest hurt and he couldn't breathe well) .... im like tell ur parents ...go to the hospital !!! ... of course when he finally did tell his mom, she's like ""go to sleep"" ... (btw his heart was 91 BPM) .... idk he freaked everyone out ...

"event","ok i know these entries suk but they are informative bout my day and i really don't have much to write bout. (plus compare them to other ppls journals and u'll see they aren't THAT bad ... especially since kevin has been writing bout his life for the last 10 days or so) .... ok so today i woke up early(earlier than i have been ...but not earlier than i have to tomorrow) b/c i had to go to the fire house. so i get there and help my brother check 19-2-1. it was missing a quart of oil (considering it takes 33 quarts not THAT big a dea), 3 scott packs and sum things were in the wrong places ... nothin big though. then i meet up wit a few of the other rookies and no one has ne idea what we are doing. finally we are directed to go upstairs b.c we are learing about bloodbourne airbourne pathogens, first aid (very lil), the tyvec suits, heppa laws (idk how to spell), privacy acts, we went over 19-4-1 (nothin new to me) ... basically an easy day. i came home ...drove my mom to the store. then came home again im not sure what i did.... then i went online for a lil while talkin to an amazing person ...MELISSA!! (chad knows who im talkin bout). then i decided to get my english hw outa the way (it;s not due tomorrow but i predict lots of other work this week so i figured i best get it done today. and now it's 7:50 and im online again (seriously i don't know what else i did b/c i know that stuff didn't take me to 7:50) ........ that's basically all i have to sayt other then i can't wait to go bak to school tomorrow! (scarcasism ppl!) actaully im hoping for a half day tomorrow and possibly being off on tues ... but i can't control that and i really don't wanna lose spring break either ...that would be bad. ..... ok i guess im done boring u know ...that's all"

"event","ok .. as i was doin my hw (i discovered a great way to side track myself)... by remembering an arguement i had with anniket in school. he said that he was a minority in mahopac (bein 80% Indian and 20% Greek). and i argued that i was more of a minority than he was and he's like ya well i don't think so im indian. (i just wanna remind him of a comment that he said more than once ... b4 this whole thing.... ""everyone loves an indian guy"") ... well im like do u have ne idea what nationalities i am ?!?!... so his answer is ITALIAN! ... immediatly im like how italian do u think i am?... and he's like 50 % (thanx for the compliment ...but NO!).. so here is a list of my nationalities (which very very few ppl know all of) ... i am ....
25% Italian (yes i know u would think im more but im really not)
25% Ukrainian (part of my minorityness in mahopac)
25% Armenian (more of my minorityness in this town)
im not sure exactly how much of each i am but im also part Irish and part Jew for the other 25% (yes im part jew .. im not sure how that works since i was baptised catholic ... but w/e)

now it's ur turn to play ur role ... who's more of a minority in this town me or anniket??

ok well time to go bak to hw ... hopefully there are sum good comments (more so than just kevin) ... and i thank him for being one of the only ppl to comment in a while..."

Black Dog .....it was a pretty good movie (the first time i saw it) ehh ... bout half way through i went to my friends house (yes melissa, mr. smiley's house) stayed there for a while until we both had to go sumplace .. me home for lunch (and i thought my dad was comming home earily) ... and him to the doctors. well i went home to discover that my internet was indeed working ....BUT none of the passwords were working newhere in my house (i wasn't surprised) ... after 40 min on hold wit suscom i finally got sum one to fix the problem. it worked fine .....until my dad came home and went online.... then every email account in the house didn't work (and still doesn't) ... i can't figure out y :( (any/all help is appreciated) ... a lil later the nice UPS guy brought me my mp3 player !!!... yay for me ...

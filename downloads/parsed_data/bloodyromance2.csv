"event","well i dont feel really well right now. i havent for the past few days as you can tell by reading my xanga. i need to write in here more often. people need to know more about how im feeling. well, its not only the break up thats like getting me. mainly it is, though, because it meant the most to me at the time. i have some other stuff happening though. its like, the world has changed so fast around me that im like lost now. and i dont know when ill be found. i need someone to find me. i need someone to make me happy again like i was about a week ago. i was the happiest man in the world. i still had problems though. like everything around me was changing too drastically and quickly like i said. but that one thing kept me up. thats what i lost. i was there for her. she was there for me all the time. i shouldnt be talking about this right now because i dont want to make all these feelings seem like their her fault. it isnt her fault. she left me, and i lost a big part of me, but as long as shes happy, then its all fine. i wish she didnt though. i miss her sooo much. she is a great person. i hope she never forgets that. plus i love her and care for her so i hope she realizes that. well, thats all for now. goodbye."

"event","the time has come, to stop being a hindrance to you. everything i have tried, it all separates the good from the bad...its the bad. this key i hold in my hands is the key to my heart...the only one left...too many have been strewn across the floor by others, none like you. you may choose to hold this key to your breast and let it take your breath away...just like that, or you may choose to let it drop into a sea of hopelessness. no meaning is there...the key is lost now. forever to lie in a never ending abyss. no return, no way to compensate for what has been done. 

but wait! there is yet light. for deep down inside, the desire to pick the key up is still there. this probably doesn't make any sense, but that key is the key handed to you when all was fresh, when all was new. are there remembrances of such instances? is there any memory of the joyful moments and not the treacherous? i should think so. when all was new, when all was fresh, everything seemed to fit in its place perfectly. the flaws, they were erased, the problems fixed, yet now there is no hope? i should think not. with every passing moment in this mixed spiral of emotions we call life, change may occur, but the strength, the ability to love, the ability to see past all things treacherous is hidden with that key. now if you should choose to find that key, to save what is not yet lost...but wait? you seem to think there is no hope left. don't fight the light. the need to find the key is locked somewhere deep inside of your heart. the need to go to the extent of sacrificing some emotion rests within you. 

though everything seems gone right now, it is, in fact, not gone, not just yet. whether you choose to bring forth the power of your heart, the power to understand, rests deep within your heart, along with the need to find the key...though none of this makes sense right now, though it all seems to be cods wallop, there is truth behind it. you just have to hold on...you just have to keep on going...the ocean is reaching forth to take me in its glorious currents...and whether you choose to follow, whether you choose to find that key...is your decision and yours only...

isn't love GRAND?!"

"event","well im back and i think ill be writing in here more often. i got rid of my myspace. i hate how people think they can go and mess things up for me. i mean i love my girlfriend with all my heart and right now i could give a shit less if you people out there say oh you dont know what love is. i could give a shit less about how some get all pissed cause me and her are in love. seriously, if you are either one of our friends, and you are all pissed or you think were stupid for loving each other, your not worth it because you should be happy that we are content with life, you shouldnt want to see us hurt you shouldnt want us to be all out of it all the time. i love jessica with everything im worth and if any of you out there disagree or think i am stupid for thinking like this, then you arent even thinking about me or jessica. all i ever want is for her to be content i want to take care of her. im not trying to take her away from anyone. im not trying to turn her into something she isnt im not trying any of that. so if you dont like how im being well im sorry then cause im just trying to keep the one special thing in my life together. i can only hope that those of you who disagree with me and my girlfriends feelings will see it our way someday. i hope those of you who think that we arent truly in love will find someone to love someday and stop thinking negative about us. i mean i hope everyone sees what im saying. i hope that everyone knows how much i love jessica. i hope noone tries to fuck this up like some have been. i love you jessica. i love you sooooo much. and to the rest of you who care about our feelings, im grateful for all of you. goodbye."

"event","yeah this whole day sux and last night sucked too. i feel like an asshole and that i dont belong here. i dont want to be here right now and noone can change how i feel because of that....i wish someone could. i hope i can feel better before it all becomes too much for me and i cant take it anymore because frankly, i dont really want to hurt myself. i miss jewlia sooo much no matter if i say shes a mean person or whatever no matter what i say about her i cannot deny that i miss her so. but i think that i need to try to move on cause shes just hurting me more than ever and my friends are all on her side about everything so i think i should just quit thinking about her and move on. my friendships are falling apart because of that relationship and i dont want that all too happen. i dont want to hurt anymore. i dont want to think about hurting myself anymore. i wish that nothing would have happened, that i didnt meet jewlia, that my band didnt break up, that everything was back to normal back when i was happy and my friends werent acting how they act now. i hope that things get better really soon cause i dont know how much more torment my puny little heart can take....im not feeling sorry for myself either. its just i know im a fool for feeling all this for a girl that dumped me like in the most stupid way i have ever heard of. that pissed me off a little...oh well i think i should go now and stop talking about my stupid life thats all upside down now...goodbye."

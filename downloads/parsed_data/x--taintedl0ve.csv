i forgot about this, damn.

i really hope i get to go to this prom tonight. or tommorrow, kalia never told me when exactly is was.
i haven't done anything exciting forever.
my life is so boring.
thats probably why i hate it.
because i never fucking do anything.
my parents are strict assholes who never LET me do anything fun.
thats why i'm going back to highschool. to fucking show them that once i go back i don't have to be around their shit anymore.
gr.

and like yesterday, my mom told my brother and i that our cousin got arrested for selling pot at his school. and i was like, it wasn't him. because i know he wouldn't do something so stupid like that. it was his dumbass friends that made him do it.
and my mom goes, ""well, you guys have never been to a real school. well you HAVE, but it was just grade school. and you don't know what peer pressure is. or what its like, etc,etc,billshit..""
OKAY. FUCK. you're telling me i don't know what peer pressure is? because i'm that fucking socially deprived? 
NOT. and who's fault is that? she doesn't get it. she's never going to get it.
i can't stand her anymore. she's totally changed. and its not even about what she said. whatever, thats not a big deal. yes, it was rude, but i'm over it.
but she thinks she's fucking hot shit.
SHE'S MY 43 YEAR OLD MOTHER. yeah, she looks good for her age. yeah, guys think she's hot. yeah, every freaking place we go, guys stare. and she's always like ""/SQUEAKY ASS ANNOYING SAD VOICE,""oh, is something wrong with me? why are they staring, OMGZ LOLZ.""
and she only does it because she wants me or anyone else to tell her because she's pretty/ attractive, whatever the fuck she wants to hear. and i know thats why. and she's gets pissy at me if i don't answer her.
everyone else is so fucking oblivious to that fact that she does it. but i know her. i know she does it for attention. and she does so much other shit. its insane. i mean, no wonder i have issues. no wonder i'm so fucking self concious and hate myself and everything else all the time. 
[oh yes, emo moment.]
damnit. i'm not even going to bother saying everything else.
DAMNIT. snddnajkdfak.
gah.


i need to calm down. jeez."

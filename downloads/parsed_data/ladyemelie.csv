"event","Tomorrow is my birthday.

I am going to turn 21 tomorrow.

I'm happy and proud of the last 21 years of my life, and excited about the years to come.

I feel like I am living my life to the fullest.  I am always busy.  I now work in a real law firm, part-time, I still study full time, I volunteer at the McGill legal information clinic, I am one of the 2 official cover artists for the Quid (Law Faculty student journal)...  among other things.

Well I'm busy.  But I feel that this is the kind of life I was made to live.  And so I am very happy right now.

I also went out on a couple of dates in the past weeks.  None was impressive, but it's just fun to meet new people, and define what is it that I want and don't want in a man.

Tomorrow is my birthday, and I am convinced that, like every other day of my life, I will feel happy and blessed."

So...

I got drunk, that I did.

Today was SO warm, I was incredibly happy to be in the saguenay... swam all day, that I did.

Didn't help the headache tho, that it didn't.

I finished the 5th Harry Potter, I was totally flabbergasted, that I was.  It was a WONDERFUL book, that it was.

And I'm gonna go nightswimming right after I'm done with all the work, that I will!

And I never thought I'd say so, but Justin Timberlake does GREAT dance music, that he does.

And I'm quite tired of talking like Kenshin, that I am!"

<b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Good Elf Mage Ranger
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Mages</b> harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Mystra</b> is the Neutral Good goddess of magic. She is also known as the Lady of Mysteries. Followers of Mystra wear armor and carry shields with her symbol on them. Mystra's symbol is a ring of stars.

So yeah, I'm about to go take a long and warm bath, and I'll go swim either today or tomorrow, since now I have a car and it'll take me 5 mins to get to the pool anyways.

I woke up early to have breakfast with mom and sis, my dad was already at work, but it doesn't matter, I'll see him tonight! :)

I arrived at the pool this afternoon only to realise that I had forgotten my swimming glasses and cap.  So I couldn't go and I was really pissed at myself.

On the other hand, maybe it's a good thing, since I have horrible cramps, and I'm having a hard time walking right now.  I almost fell on my way back from the metro station.

I'm quite happy.  This guy I noticed a few weeks ago in my family law class actually came to talk to me today.  He always sits in front of me, and he just smells SO GOOD!  I just wish I could shove my head in his sweater and breathe in!  I think he wears Aqua di Gio for men... TOTALLY sexy.

So yeah, the class was boring, and I took out a piece of paper and started drawing something.  It ended up being quite a cool drawing, and at the end of the class he turned to talk to my friend Brian, who was sitting next to me, and he saw my masterpiece and seemed extremely impressed, telling me I have talent, and giving me the most gorgeous smile ever, so I thanked him, and he asked what I thought of the class and so on.

Thank God for my drawing abilities, now I have a reason to say ""hey"" when he passes by, and eventually start a real conversation with him.  And I think that if I have the opportunity to ask him if he wants to have lunch/coffee with me, I won't hesitate to do it... Somehow I don't feel intimidated when he looks at me.  He has this really gentle look about him, and eventhough I am true to myself and I am shy around him, it's not as bad as around other guys.

Maybe my change of attitude and my change of wardrobe has more influence over me than I think, after all."

"event","So it's for real now, my exams are all done.  And I'm using my parents' computer to write this right now.  Geez I missed this place...  Well, I came here quite often recently, so I didn't really miss it, but rather I missed being peacefully at home, without a single worry in the world...

Just like when I was still little Emelie, the princess of her house, when my mom was the source of all knowledge and my dad was the only man that counted in my life.

I always feel like I am a kid again when Christmas is coming.  I feel like I'm 5 years old again now.  And it's a good feeling.

I took the bus with Dana today.  Was more fun than travelling alone, even if we didn't talk much.  I guess the sole fact that she was with me made the whole thing better.  That's what friends are for. :)

*hugs the unpresent Dana*

We also stopped in Quebec City to see JP.  He like the gift I bought him, and I thought the gifts he got me were pretty cool too.  But I was really hurt/dissapointed by his reaction to the drawing I made for him.   It took me 5 hours to draw, ink and color that thing.  He didn't even say he liked it when he saw it.  He didn't say anything at all, in fact, and it did make me quite sad.

Other than that, I was supposed to go to that new LotR showing with Marc tonight... byt since there is some kind of annoying tiny ice storm outside, I can't...  Roads aren't safe at ALL.  I'll just go another time with him.  We're both dissapointed, cause we missed each other a lot, but I'll see him at Christmas anyways, for our traditionnal Christmas supper.

So instead of going to the movies, I decided to take a long, warm, rose-sented bath with candles, a good book and soft music... I did, and now I am totally relaxed.  I could ask for nothing more.

So it was a long day, but Little Emelie is home...

Home at last."

Tho right now, I am just plain tired.  My back hurts and I am hungry.  And I wish I could sleep and relax a bit.

I'll do that tomorrow.

*sighs*  Time to get back to it.

And btw, JP, my exam went pretty well, thx. ;)"

No exam until the 17th... So I have plenty of time to study, and I can take it easy until then!

Plus this morning I went shopping for shoes with my dad, and that made me super cheery, spending time (and money) with him and all.  I have this office party on the 13th and I had the perfect little black dress, the perfect jewelry... but no shoes!  So now, I got the whole sexy/classy outfit to impress the cute little engineer whom I worked with this summer. ;)

*evil grin*

*sings* Yeaaah youuuu shook me aaaaall niiiigh loooong! lalala :p

"event","My dad was in montreal yesterday, and he took me out for dinner.  I was so happy to see him, and to spend some time with him, and talk.  It was quite special for me, since I don't go out very often, I don't see my dad that often either, and when I do we rarely get the chance to have a long talk.  But yesterday, I got the three of those, and it made me very, very happy.

But it also made me realise that I miss home very much.  And now... now...

...I just wanna be home.

I woke up this morning, and I remembered I have this crappy Pass/Fail exam this afternoon.  I know I'm gonna pass.  Everyone is going to pass.  But I'm still stressed.

And I'm totally fed up with studying too.  Now I wish I could be home.

*sighs*

Home...

If my exams would be all done, I would have woken up home this morning and gone downstairs, and I would have taken my morning coffee with my mom and dad in front of our Christmas tree.  If I was home, I could have driven my little sister to school, and given her a huge hug before she would have gotten out of the car.

If I would be home, I could spend the whole day doing some holiday cooking with mom, and then relax, take a warm bath and read a good book.  Maybe help her fold the laundry, talk with her, tell her about how my semester was and so on...  And at night, I'd eat dinner with them all, mom, dad and little sis, and I'd feel so happy to be with them, and not eating dinner alone, like I always do.

I'm gonna study hard for my exams.  Very hard.  But to be honest, right now, I miss my family so much that I'm at a point where I don't really care about school.  I want to be with them, and be home to wait for Christmas to arrive.

I don't know how people can manage to spend the holidays alone... It's a horrible thing for someone to be alone at Christmas.  And I'm going to pray for everyone to have someone to be with for Christmas this year.

*sighs*

Time to go back to my studying."

Hey, don't look at me like I'm a weirdo!  Who could resist a man with enough taste to buy his Lady Gucci shoes?  :p    Besides, even if he eats people, he IS charming, knowledgeable and very smart!! And I only like the classy side of his personnality, otherwise he does freak me out. Too bad he is a cannibal. Only means nothing's perfect.  Oh well...

I am just sitting here listening to Country VH1. yes.. COUNTRY.. yes.. I LIKE COUNTRY.. so shoot me. *sigh* Life sucks. I kinda.. told some people that if they wanted to do something... it wouldnt hurt me.. and.. in reality.. it crushed me.. and.. I want what I had back. Even if what I had didnt seem to really care.. Thats ok. Everyone happy? Super. I'm glad. As long as you are all happy.. I'll get over it. Remember this.. NOTHING CAN BRING ME DOWN! Ever.

~Always remember me.. When you are lonely.. I'll keep you company.. When you cry.. I will dry your tears and pretend that they never existed..Don't forget me~

**^**I just wanted you to know.. I love the way you laugh**^**"

"event","Shooting stars and hopes and dreams
All crushed into tiny nothings
Things that will
things that wont
Things that make you smile
and things that dont.
Tiny pieces scatter the ground
I look but there is no one around
Slowly I pick up the pieces of my life
Glue them together With the love that you gave me

This day was so long ago
I look back on it and wonder why i've changed
And I think..
That
Shooting stars and hopes and dreams
Are no longer tiny nothings
They are whole and strong
They live on and on
I tell anyone that will listen 
To have shooting stars and hopes and dreams
Because they will get you through anything."

Have you ever liked someone. But.. the someone doesnt know.. and he has his own things to deal with, so he doesnt need to know. Yet, you long to tell him. You want him to know... But your'e scared... I dunno. Maybe I am just.. going on about nothing. I mean, who really cares? I do. I care. I'm sorry if its wrong that I like you.. But I do. And.. I'd tell you.. but I dont want to hurt you. I know that it would if I did tell you. I know what you are all thinking.. Why doesnt this stupid chick take chances? right? Well.. I cant answer your question.. Truth is, I dont know why I wont take this chance either. What am I afraid of? Rejection? Looking like an idot? Him saying that he feels the same way? We couldnt go out anyway. It would be .. weird. I dont know why. He treats me like his little sister anyway. I dunno. We are just good friends. I can tell him anything. I dont want to ruin that. I know that I would... I tend to ruin things.. But.. meh. I tend to do a lot of things. Most of them make no sense.. yet.. every now and then.. I will do or say something that turns everything that has gone wrong.. into something great. I know he will never read this.. but.. if he ever does..he will know exactly who he is..
Im going to go and shop online now.. so.. I will prolly be back on later..."

"event","Hidy ho everyone! I am not sure what to type about. But yet.. I am typing. I suppose I could tell you all about this sonnet that I must memorize for language. It sucks. but ohwell. It is really really hard. And its due friday! ick! Oh well. It's really REALLY SUPER HARD! Hehe. I am so tired. I didnt get any sleep last night. Oh well. hehe. I think i will go.. But.. Here is a poem. My most recent. 

Saddened Senses 

Tears fill my eyes, 
so that I cannot see
Words get stuck in my throat
So that I cannot speak
Bitter grief fills my mouth
So that I cannot taste
Yelling fills my ears
So that I cannot hear anything else
Fear makes me numb
So that I cannot feel the world around me
Sadness fills my stomach
So that I am no longer hungry
All of this aches my heart 
So much that it stops beating
And now I'm gone"

"event","Well.. I thought that My first Journal should be something totally awesome. I write poems. But this is not my work. I do not know who wrote this.. But I do know that it gets me through each and every day. Every time i am upset. Every times something happens. or someone leaves, I think of this poem and recite it to myself. It is a great poem.. Enjoy...

                      Love
Seasons change
friends move away
and life goes on from day to day

flowers fade
and streams run dry
and many times we wonder why

Yet we can always be assured
because God tells us in his word
that unlike changes in the weather
LOVE goes on and lasts FOREVER."

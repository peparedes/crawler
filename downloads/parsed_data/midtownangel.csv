Comment to be added...let me know how you came across this journal, what we might have in common and anything else you feel like saying.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that I&nbsp;spend way too much time in Photoshop, therefore, the banner is likely to change at some point, but obviously, it&#39;s still my journal. If you&#39;re looking for fic/graphics, you can find them at either of my &quot;creative LJ&#39;s&quot;:&nbsp;<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://love-midtown.livejournal.com/profile""><img alt=""[info]"" height=""17"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" style=""border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-right: 1px; vertical-align: bottom; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px"" width=""17"" /></a><a href=""http://love-midtown.livejournal.com/""><b>love_midtown</b></a></div>&nbsp;for all things L&amp;O and <lj user=""noveltyoflife"" />&nbsp;for all things Homicide: Life on the&nbsp;Street.<br /><br />That&#39;s about all I&#39;ve got for you now, so have at it."

"event","Firstly: this post is going to stay public till the end of the week, which I am determining as being Sunday, since it&#39;s already Wednesday.&nbsp;

Secondly, the purpose of it is to...idk, clear the air, I guess? I&#39;ve been having thoughts lately about the hockey fandom (in particular, the side that also writes fic) and guys, I&#39;ve gotta tell you, sometimes I wonder why I&#39;m even still kicking around on that side. But I like to write and I also happen to like hockey, and if the two happen to coincide, then so be it. TBH, not all of what I write is hockey!fic and not all of it is on LJ, either.&nbsp;

So. Public post. (for now) &nbsp;Anonymous commenting is enabled (I think and if not I&#39;ll fix it). If any of y&#39;all feel like you have something you want to say to me, here&#39;s a place to do it.&nbsp;

I will say this, though: I&#39;ll respond to pretty much anything unless it starts getting out of hand. I trust that you guys will know where that line is.&nbsp;

Thirdly: regardless of what side of whatever fandoms any of you on my f-list happen to be on (or what hockey teams you favor; I know I have Bruins fans on here and I like the Habs; Pens fans and the Caps are my hometown team, so it&#39;s not like I actually care as long as things stay relatively civil), you&#39;re all basically awesome. I might not know you IRL and may never know you IRL, but from what I see here, I can tell that much.&nbsp;

Anyway. Here goes nothing.&nbsp;"

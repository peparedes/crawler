"event","<center>A good friend is hard to find</center>
<center>An ode to Meg</center>

Me and Megan have been friends since the beginning of 6th grade. I knew then that there was going to be a special relationship between us. 

We were always inseperable. But we didn't become as close as we are now until freshman year. Because through junior high, Megan hung out with the ""popular"" crowd, and I just didn't like that crowd <b>AT ALL</b>. Therefore, we weren't AS inseperable as we are now. And I'm so happy that that turningpoint for us came along.

Me and Megan have gone through everything together. Every stupid inside joke I have is between us. Every boyfriend, I've had her to discuss about it with. Every boyfriend <b>SHE'S</b> had, I've been here for her. That's what's great about us. We share the listening and caring. It's not one person doing all the work.

I'm glad Megan's happy now. Real glad. John is good for her, and so is getting rid of Levi and all that other bullshit. I hope she stays like this forever. She's such a caring and understanding person...it hurts me to see her when she's hurt or upset.

<center>A Note To Megan:</center>
Megan, you're my best friend and I thank God every day that I have you. I truly don't know what I'd do without you. You let me practically live in your house and you're there for constant support. I'm sorry that I spazzed at you about Chase, it wasn't your fault. I'm glad that he's joining us more and more too. We have fun. I have only one more thing to say...
<center>I love you Meg, just like a sister</center>

<center>Thanks Megieflopadopalis</center>"

"event","Me and Bob broke up. I can't believe this happened. We've been going out since December. And now it's all come to an end. We fought too much. Plus another factor, which turned out to be a false alarm anyway(megan and John know what I mean). I miss him alot already. He was flirting with girls today, and it was pissing me off alot. But hey, he's not mine anymore, right? Right.Anyway, I'm at Megan's, and we're gonna go make cheese fries...so buh bye every1.

I love megan...j/k"

"event","Well, I'm at my house, bored. I didn't go to Megan's tonight. She was kinda tired after the day we had today, and the show tonight. It was a real good show though. I gotta get some fabric tomorrow, cause I gotta work on my project for state. So I'm gonna go and work on that a bit.

I love Bob"

"event","Well, I'm doing my first journal entry. I'm bored, and Megan told me to make one. Me, being the good friend that I am, did it for her. Awww, yeah, let's all feel good and mushy.

Anyway, I just wanted to write a little, I'm on my way to my boyfriend Bob's house. Maybe I'll write more. Never know"

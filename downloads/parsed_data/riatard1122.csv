"event","Well. I know you all have missed me greatly so I'll write a bit!

I log into LJ all the time to be a creep and read everyone elses journals but I never update my own, and since I skipped my class and I am waiting for my next.... I figured now would be a great time!!!!!!!!

School is going pretty well, my room is really small though. I do have my own bathroom which is pretty sweet. And by ""my own"" I mean me, my roommate, and the two girls next door share the bathroom. It is just like a door in our room. sometimes its awkward but we like it.
My classes are pretty good, I skipped this one class today because I can not stand the teacher. It is one of those teachers that likes the sound of his own voice so he just talks and talks and DOESNT STOP until the last 2 minutes of class. Its really annoying. Other than that crazy guy i like all of my classes. They all seem pretty easy except my stats class which I am pretty nervous about. Oh, and chem... why am I taking chem? I dont know cause I am crazy and my roommate made me. So i guess my classes arent all the easy. oh well... I will get over it.

I go home everyweekend which I am not happy about but I need the money. If you couldnt tell from the previous sentence I go home to work. I work Friday night and Saturday night at Big Fresh(it's off of route 9 near the mall... and its WICKED GOOD) and I work Saturday and Sunday mornings at good ole Dunkin donuts. Isnt it funny that I get paid more at Big Fresh and I just started??? Dunkins are cheap bastards and if it wasnt for the tips I would quit! No thats a lie, I could never leave dunkin donuts. They own me and everyone else that works that. There are a view select people that have escape the grasp....KAITLYN EAST! you lucky asshole.

Well I think thats about enough updating for me... even though it really wasnt that much. :)

I started writing my paper but since its not due till wednesday, i dont plan on finishing it until tuesday night. procrastination is not a good thing. its alright though, i always get my work down.

i am watching emeril right now and he is making a caramel, milk chocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate, dipped apple. he is friggen insane. it looks so gross. maybe if there was one layer of each on a different apple it would be ok. but all of them on one is just crazy.

being bored is no fun. especially when you cant leave to go out and do anything because you will just get attacked by snow. hmm i keep putting down snow, but it helped me not have to write my paper. oh well.


for those of you who didnt get school cancelled tomorrow, SUCKS FOR YOU! hahahahahaha

I really dont have much to update about. I really dislike the fact that it is supposed to snow so much. i do not like snow unless it comes mon.-fri. what is the point of it snowing on the weekend? oh thats right. to ruin my plans :(

anywho. school is alright i guess. im doing good this semester so far. i have a paper to write but clearly i am going to procrastinate and not write it until sunday night around 9 or 9:30. 4/6 of my classes are with my bestest friends meaghan and susie. and the other two contain some friends also. i cant wait until spring break because then i will be going to Pine Island, FL with m&s. It should be fun. i hope. i need some warm weather and i dont feel like waiting till summer to get it.

i miss my friends from high school. i want to go back(except for the drama) i want to just be able to be a 5 minute drive away from everyone and not have to call 3 days in advance to make sure its ok i visit. its 100% depressing. i just cant wait until summer i guess. i want it more now than i did in high school. who knows..  maybe its just me?



this is enough updating for now. maybe ill keep it up. who knows? comment if you'd like"

this one time, on thursday night... we had a fire alarm at 2 in the morning. and had to wait until almost 4 to go back inside. some idiot knocked the sprinkler head off in the boys bathroom of the 2nd floor of the attached dorm. i was mad but it was funny to see the people who were drunk start to freak out. and some girl was unconscious and didnt hear the fire alarm go off. she had puke all over her and had to be taken away in an ambulance. sucks for her haha.

Prom was so much fun, i had a blast and senior week was awesomeeeeeeeeeee. <3 im so excited to me out of HS. My graduatoin party(for my moms side) was good, i bought a digital camera and some stuff for school with the money i got. i went to wal*mart and bought a comfitor and plates and stuff with a gift certificate i got from my gram. i have another party for my dads side but i dont know when that is.

My two weenie dogs had to be given away which truly devastated me. i loved those guys, but i know they went to a good home.

I dont know about my other classes but I think they are all ok to, not that you care that.

Oh!!! btw, im going to put annoymous comments back on my lj but if you leave a rude comment and dont tell me who you are its going away again. if you have something to say, id like if you said it to my face and not through a computer. :)

I might be moving to a smaller place soon. Im excited, i dont know why. i think it will be fun to move. im pretty sure its going to be just me and my mom, except when im at school. my brother and sister want to live with my dad i think. oh well, everyone has their own opinion and what not.

im sitting next to rachael in the computer lab. she is typing her paper. HI RACH! <3.... she is pretty neato.

today we had a senior assembly is it is so weird that im going to be graduatinggggg!!! IM SO EXCITEDDDD!!!

work is pretty  much awesome. my paychecks are sweet and i now have money to go out and do stuff. although i do owe my mother 130 for paying my insurance once and my father 250 for paying 5 of my phone bills. but hey! 380 beans isnt bad! i can make that easily. i have thirty two hours next week 32 hrs. x $7.50/hr = $240 yeah im must be pretty excited about that. take out some money for taxes and you get a little less but im not worried thats still a lot of money. (well for me anyways)

Ive been spending a lot of my time with john latley. it feels so good to be with him. he is jsut so amazinggg!!!! <33333 everyone should be able to have what I have. yayyyy!!!! :):):) i love him!

lets see, not to much has been going on lately. ill tell you what did happen last night though! so my sister was going out and i was sleeping in my bed, but she came in to see me before she left. i said ""put the dogs away"" because they had been outside for a while and she just didnt do it. so when i wake up i got to let my puppies in, but there was only one. :( so john came over and we went looking for Jack because he had ran away, my neighbors helped but then it just got to dark. i was really really sad because it was cold out last night and i was getting scared. today after i got home from work i made some flyers and put a picture on it and hung them around my neighborhood area. within 5-10 min. of me starting, my brother called and told me to come home cause someone had him!!! <3 i was so happy! frankie was happy when jack came home. the people had found him last night and took him in! so he wasnt cold or anything. i guess he slept on a little girls feet last night at the end of her bed. its cute but hes MINE not your you little brat! i mean, thank you for findind him <3 hahahah

today i worked 8:30-2. It was alright, i saw brit and jess and thats about it. no one usualy visits me. but thats ok. i put the most gorgeous ring on hold today and its on sale from 125 to like 50 bucks. John said hed buy it for me, but i dont know if he was kidding or not haha. its 10k gold ring with a pink saphire heart in the middle with two little diamonds on each side. uhhhh its so pretty! im trying to find it online right now but i cant. maybe ill get to show you :) hmmm

Nothing to exciting had been going on, then again does anything exciting ever happen in medway? i started my job at Kohls and its fun, except i hate when idiots pick up things that dont have tags on them and expect me to just give them the price they say. seriously, how stupid do you think i am?? oh well, its not really bad i just am in the complaining mood haha. :) 

we didnt have school on friday which was pretty super. Christin came down thursday night and we had funnnnnnn <3 i love that girl, nothing could ever break us apart. especialy dumb IDIOTS. (she knows who i'm talkin about) 12 years of best friends doesnt just go down the drain. stupid idiot. grrr!!! well i love her anyways! we ate d'angelos which was tremendous. i guess you arent supposed to eat meat on good friday, or any friday during lent. woops. haha oh well i got a buffalo chicken wrap and it was amazing.

Last night i had work! on the way there i stopped at dunks to visit kait. i looked in my purse to find my diet coke had spilled EVERYWHERE in my purse. so i was pretty angry but i got over it. i had to get a new lanyard for work and i think Paul was mad. Paul looks like he should be in a movie being a dumb boss. like from office spain or anchorman or something. i dunno its creepy, but funny at the same time. i worked till 10ish and then i went to my boys house. <3 he is so amazing, really if you dont have one.... you should get one. eeee! ok well im done updating for today. im to lazt to write anything else.

oh. ps. i sent in my paperwork for Bridgewater State College so im def. going there next year. :)

Today is St. Patricks day.... i'm not one to celebrate my Irish heritage but I guess I will today. :)

The past couple of days have been ok. I had to make up the most horrible english on the face of this earth and i prolly got a 10 out of 100. it was TERRIBLE we have been watching frankenstein the past 3 days and its surprisingly not that bad, we finished it today. I have been assigned so many papers and projects its terrrrrible. let me tell you....
Psych - 3 Pager paper on one of 5 topics..... and the movie project which includes another three pager. due i dont know when...
current events- music project due... whenever, he hasnt given me my date to go yet.
english- essay on frankenstien (HOYYYYY) due wednesday and a thesis paper(7-10 pgs) HOY! I think im going to do a clockwork orange for mine.

it doesnt seem like a lot but it really is. I hate school and I cant wait for it to be over. College is prolly just as hard but its ok. I just wanna get out of the house and be on my own. Umass Amherst STILL hasnt sent me an accepted/denied letter yet. why cant they just tell me? They have sent a letter to just about everyone else from medway Im still waiting to hear from Framingham State also but im not too worried about that. As of right now my top choice is bridgewater state. and if i get in to Umass i dont know what im going to do! Helppppp.

so my last entry made me laugh. all you people tell me you read this yet never comment. :( that makes me sad. so comment ok?

ew my cell phone keeps beeping. it wants me to charge it but im to lazy to walk upstairs and plug it in. hoyyyy... ok im going to go now, bye kiddies!"

We had an assembly B period to see Mr Burch cause he is back from Iraq. awww he is so cute! and his little kids are twoooo ( he had some pictures to show us) it was awesome, i liked it. In english everyone took a really hard test but i didnt take it cause i ""wasnt ready"" so i took a semi-easier one.. but it was still hard and I was sad, i really dont want to do the Literary Terms/Paradise Lost test. I might cry when i take it. oh well, wish me luck!!!! well i had a doctors appt. today. IT TOOK FOREVER!!! ugh i hate waiting.

"event","Well ill start with sunday, i believe thats where i left off :)

on sunday i waited went out with Kait and Stacey. first we went to the tanning spa and they tanned. i decided not to... then we went to apple bees. Kait and I got chicken fajita wraps. omg they are so good they make me... well, they are good :) stacey got a bacon cheeseburger. yum! i paid for kait for her birthday and then i drove them both home. then for some reason kait and i both decided we wanted to go to walmart, so off we went. i was trying to find a new purse and I coudlnt find one at Wal*Mart so we went to Tarjayyyy(Target) and i found the best purse ever! Then Kait wanted to copy me so she went in and got the same one. but since they are reversable, we have it on different sides. then i hung out with john... he came over and we just watched TV.

Monday i woke up and i was dying so i decided i wasnt going to go to school. i went to the doctor and she told me i have an early stage of bronchitis. joy. so she gave me three prescriptions. one inhaler to help me stop coughing, one thing of pills for antibiotics. and one for robitussin with codeine in it, hahaha oh man. that was funny when i took that. i basically slept all day. Kait called and she wanted me to go with her to get her ear peirced but the place was closed so she just brought me home since i did not feel well. no john :( but i got to talk to him online

Today i woke still dead so i stayed home. i feel like crum. sorry kait im not going with you today, momma said if i didnt go to school i cant go out. hoy. maybe john will come see me today. that would be good. maybe the mail is finnaly hear since ive checked it 3 times today. i have an obsession now with the mail since ive been getting my college letters. i NEED to get into UMass. i check everyday online but still nothing. ugh why cant they just say yes or no??? i talked to Shelly about BSC and she said she loved it there. mmm i dont know i havent gotten in there either, so far my choices are Salem State, Westfield State, and Nichols College. If i have to choose from those three, its def. going to be westfield but its really far. hoy!

oh joy! the mail just came... but no letters from schools. WTF! JUST SEND IT ALREADY! ok im going to go now. bye bye!"

well we get our progress reports today and so far im doing good! i have an 88 in psych which is insane cause i thought i was failing. a B- in current events which is sick because current events is wicked easy and i should have an A+++++ but i dont. sad! in chorus i prolly have like a 100 because she loves me. In sociology i prolly have a c.... or hopefully i do because i cant have a D or ill cry, same goes for english because i need good grades and i need to pass. HOYYYY. math i know i have an A and if i dont ill prolly cry because that class is just rediculously easy.

im supposed to be in chorus right now but we are watching the Newsies and i decided i didnt want to watch that so i asked Mrs. A if i could go to the guidance office to ""talk to my counsler"" but in actuality i just wanted to play on the computer.

i keep checking the UMass website in hoping that i will eventually get in. If i dont ill will def. cry because thats my top choice school and my brother and sister both got in. if i dont get in ill be the reject of the family. HOYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!! i hate stress. i just wish colleges would pick who they wanted really fast! that way i would know at like the begining of february. itd be stupendous.

this is kind of a long entry because the last one i did was just a baby one. omg hahahahhahaahahah if anyone knows the guidance office than you know the little bench outside of it. and i looked over to look out the window and low and behold there is a little mexican walking around on the bench. omg haha its so funny, now he is washing the windows. oh man. i laugh at the stupidest things

So shes like i dont know what should i do? I responded by saying ""well you could go back to bed, go online, go watch tv.... go back to bed....."" so she went back to bed i think... or i dunno.

Math was intense. except it wasnt at all... greg got kicked out which is basically a weekly thing haha. then i went to gym... mr jackson was there, i dont know why. maybe he wanted to make sure mrs grants baby didnt pop out during a badmiton match or something. I forgot my pants for gym :( but she gave me half credit!!! santa and i played on a team and whooped cory and karas buts! (thats a lie, it was a close game!) then we played adam and rob... it was sad they beat us like 15-3.... sad!!! oh well! then i came home and adam drove me to go get my car! thanx adam! then i put some money in the bank, went tanning and came home. Then adam and i were bored so we went to visit Jet at work. he booted us. IDIOT! jk jet! friends forever! Now i am home waiting for jet to get out of work so we can party. minus the party haha... :):)

I went, coudlnt pee enough... went and got a drink at McDonalds, went back and couldnt pee again... walked around Walmart for a bit, went to CVS and drank a whole bottle of water, sat for about 30 min then i went in and peed like it was nobodys business. the lady was happy hahahaha she was angry before cause i cant be on comand. then my dad dropped me off at home, then he went home. bye bye daddy! then, i went to JMS's house and i got several phone calls. i got one from kait asking me to hang out, sorry kait! then i got one from mish and rach, hi buddies!!!! then i got one from Truff asking me if i was at the Providence Place Mall cause she though she saw my car... even though she knew i dropped it off to get fixed on tuesday. she is a funny kid. Then i went home and slept!

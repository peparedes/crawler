Just sickened...

This whole country is going to Hell in a hand basket because of those stupid as Christians. They want to force everything they think on others, because they are bastards like that. I feel like I'm sitting on hot coals, I'm jumpy about the whole situation. I am a witch, I am very loud about my beliefs, I have two gay moms, and I am a little stuck here. Something has to be fucking done, but I'm really not sure what. I'm stuck; very stuck, and most people I know can leave if they want. I am just stuck in this roach motel.

And, as most people who know me will tell you; I'm the kind of person who want things done yesterday."

"event","Well, I'm reading this debate on whether or not demons are real. Well, I thought of doing a huge ass post on exactly my beliefs, but remembered that it would go in one ear and out the other. So, why not here? It's somewhere other than Cheatplanet....

I take no responsibility for any madness/confusion/tearing down of religious beliefs this causes. 

The title that most fits me, if I had to pick one, would be a Chaos Witch. Now that I have that out of the way... where should I start...Eh.... Alright, how everything started. 
Alright, before everything, there was nothing. Zip, zilch, nada. Of course, anyone who knows the least bit of magick, knows that nothing could very well be darkness (Only after I played Kingdom Hearts did I realise how close that damn game was to my belief...); a kind of magickal energy. Eventually, that energy developed a kind of consiousness typical of energy, thus developing it own preferences or personalities. From these developed the various energies most magicians have come to know; Fire, Water, Air, Earth. All of these combined would make Spirit. From those energies, the material world would have inevitablly had to develop, as the material world is connected to the spiritual world on many different levels, even if those levels don't quite reveal themselves readily. This is a very condensed, very genralized version.

Next, various gods/goddesses. There were no actual gods or goddesses, not even now in the sense of the term. There may now be entities that would represent a type of god or goddess; based solely on the fact of how popular religion is. If anyone has heard of golems, you can skip this part. If you have not, golems are like magical, spiritual extensions of oneself that can be shaped and molded as one sees fit. This is what Allah/God/Shiva/Ea/Dimiter is, golems created by humans because of their beliefs; the spiritual energies reacting with this belief. 

There are original spirtual beings; none that we have properly recognized, I can assure you. There is no ultimate being; just a multitude of various spirits. (Never wanted to tell anyone this, but Hell, why not.) I actually have a demon-like guardian that I have known since I can remember. For some reason, of which I am trying to find out, he protects me and guides me. Solely because of his appearance and me being me back then; I have always called him Damion, although I know this isn't his real name. His real name, I can hardly pronounce, let alone spell."

Now then; much to discuss. Hellsing manga 4 is finally out! Integra and Victoria have a little yuri scene, Shrodinger has the hots for Voctoria, inuendos abound once more, and I still want a bigger role for Dok, cause he is fucking awesome....
 Ach, out of time.... Next time I'll talk about this little demonic possesion debate I'm reading."

"event","People have connections. Some of them others know, some of them others don't know. When you fuck with someone, you learn about those secret connections a little too late. My ex thinks he can walk up to me, make backhanded comments, threaten me and my boyfriend and get away with it? I don't think so. He doesn't know my connections. My connections are dangerous. I could have him lying in a gutter with a few phone calls, should I so desire strongly enough.
The lesson: don't fuck with people unless you know all their connections.

"event","Eh, sorry, I haven't been keeping up lately. Now, I'm going to give a little parenting discussion today. Double standards.
Some people feel they must have double standards for their children in order to keep them safe and ultimately treat them fairly. Some believe that double standards is something that must be avoided at all costs. I believe the former. Not every child is the same. You have different expectations for different children, thus you must modify what they can and can not do. But, of course, when it borders on being sexist...
My mother will let my eleven year old brother walk to his practices at night, but I can't even step outside the house.... 
As I said, double standards...

Shit I've done today:

"event","Well, I was watching the debate last night, and there are a few things I've noticed...:

Bush:
-Has made his position very clear through repetition.
-Almost set off the buzzer a few times.
-Did not take notes; thus to me sounding like he wasn't prepared.
-Talked to the general public on a sort of personal level.
-Was getting a little flustered toward the middle-end of the debate.
-Danced around the subject at times, but eventually got to it.

Kerry:
-Was getting close to when the buzzer would sound.
-Gave Bush a variety of subjects to think on.
-Played off of what we've all been hearing in the papers.
-Used his Viet-vet experience as a lever again.
-Kerry did an opening speech when they said no opening comments.

It still cracks me up that:
-Bush jumped when they tested the buzzer and said, ""I won't go over.""
-They made Kerry look a thousand times bigger than Bush.
-Kerry got around the whole ""No opening comment"" thing by making an ""Opening speech"". 
-Ci Jay went on about how good of a scandal it would be if there were two lesbian candidates, they were both ex-lovers and they had a cat fight during the debate.

In my opinion, the debate was pointless, content-wise. Both competitors repeated everything that's been in the papers and all over the news. (Although, I at one point, want to see the issue of the draft come up.) The debate was more for the purpose of seeing how each candidate would react to a series of questions. Of which, when it comes to the latter, it proved to be mildly effective.

Stuff I've done today:
-Messed up my hair by not drying it enough.
-Grabbed my string. (^_^)
-Got to school not late for once.

Stuff I've got to do:
-Do chores.
-Do laundry.
-Clean room.
-Get to the library.
-Pay the fine.
-Get Faust and report book.
-Do homework.
-Go to bed (At 1 in the damned morning.....)"

"event","Alright, I was listening to Howard Stern this morning, and I decided he would be my topic for the day. Howard Stern is the kind of radio host that wouldn't change his tune for anyone. If he doesn't like someone, or someone is a cheap scate, nothing anyone says would change his mind. Now, I admit, he has one Hell of an ego, but don't we all? He says the truth and only the truth. Howard, please stick around long enough for me to go to school in my new car, listening to you.

"event","Alright ladies and gents, never wrap a sprained/bruised/whatever foot too tightly in an ace bandage, put a sock over it and a sock on. You'll end up cutting off the circulation, making it much worse. Just thought I'd get that out of the way. You know what, people worry too much. First my boyfriend Steven started worrying about me and my foot, then Chris when she saw all the bruises, then my Mom. So, what is the moral of the story? PEOPLE CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES! (Unless of course you're a person who is too young to completely take care of themselves, or your a submissive.)

Moving on, I just got done reading a book Ci Jay gave me. It is a BDSM rendition of Dracula by Amarantha Knight. I must say, this is definitely one of the better written, tasteful erotic books I have read. It could have been a bit more tasteful in my opinion, although Ci Jay's expectations appear to be a bit lower then mine. Either way, it is definitely one of the better books out there. If you're into that kind of stuff, I'd say check it out. It involves gay, straight and lesbian relationships; including everything from just two people to four-somes to mass orgies.

Now then, moving on again. Anne Rice and her Vampire Chronicles is a very strange thing to like or dislike. There's is no in between, you either love her for her beautiful, poetic Romantic-era-style or hate her for her sappy-ass, weepy, brooding ranting. I personally keep switching. There are times when her vampires can get very annoying with there constant sappivity. Then again, she does have a very poetic nature. Now, I just said you can't be in the middle, right? Well, I'm not. There are months when I really hate her books and there are months when I love them to death. This month, it's the later.

"event","You know what, people just can't help but put labels on everything. Like if you try to look at the good things in a situation, you're an optimist. Try to look on the bad things about a situation and you're a pessimist. Now, I don't blame people, most people have an inclination to one or the other that nearly rules their life. But what is the most productive? A realist. A realist will see the situation as what it is and not make anything more or less of it. A realist would be one Hell of a business person.

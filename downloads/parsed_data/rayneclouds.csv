"event","Wow. A week off because of snow and I still haven't done much of anything. I keep telling myself all that I need to do something but what I really need to start me going is boxes. At least I can pack a bunch of things and get it out the way. Ugh. Need Costco!

Anyway, didn't go in today or yesterday. Yesterday was because Ty couldn't be bothered and .. of course, I'm not walking all the way to the academy alone. What if I fell into a ditch? Okay, that's overdramatic but still. I didn't go today and at least this time we made it out the door with the intention of actually going. I think we made it about 4 feet. Most terrifying few minutes ever. I was clinging to Ty and was just like okay, this is ridiculous. We weren't even off our driveway yet! How was I going to get to class? Thats 20 minutes or so to the station and 20 minutes from it at the other end. Hell no. Called in, like yesterday, but told them I wasn't going to risk my safety when I was having trouble simply trying to navigate out of the estate .. let alone to college near busy, bustling roads.

Well, I have until next week to study for this final exam. Of which, I haven't even spared a glance at .. SO NOW I START FREAKING. CRAM SESSION. I have very few [VERY FEW] days to learn all of this:

"event","<font face=""georgia"" size=""1""> My racing heart beat rapidly against my ribs, breath hitching as the anxious feeling surged through my body to its very core as I dashed outside the diner and returned to the smoldering heat of the sun once again. ""Hey!"", I called out hoarsely, throat remaining arid and dry, swearing that my vocal cords were shriveling like a raisin. Sharp orbs flickered around the deserted town, searching for the figure or whatever the head of hair had belonged to. My head snapped to the right, my peripheral vision catching movement. The young child had dashed around the side of the diner, the red cap falling off his head as it fluttered lightly to the floor. I jogged after him, crouching as I ran to grasp the hat between my fingertips, straightening and rounding the diner's worn and dusty walls. ""Wait!"", I forcefully called out once more, the kid now in my sights once again. He didn't even glance back, just continued to run as if I were some complete psycho. My lips curved slowly into a small smirk as I began to catch up, reaching out with my free hand as it just skimmed the top of his matching red hoodie. Speaking of, who wears a <i>hoodie</i> in two hundred and fifty degree weather? And he was running like I was nuts? A small chuckle worked its way to my throat but I forced it down, recalling what had happened when I tried to cough with my dried throat, certainly not wanting to repeat that again. Choking wasn't exactly a favorite. Extending my fingers once again as I ran forward, stumbling slightly upon the loose pebbles beneath my sneakers, they curled at the contact of the hoodie. Yes, my brain screamed as I adjusted my hold, stopping the kid in his tracks. I saw him completly freeze, neck muscles tensing visibly. 

The smirk tugged at the corner of my lips, yet I wondered why he had yet to turn and look at the stranger that had caught him red handed. Doing what, I wasn't certain, but it was obviously something for him to take off running like that. Unfortunately, as my hand extended to turn him around, the kid had unzipped the hoodie and took off running once again. I gave an exasperated sigh, eyes flickering and drawn the objects that he had lost. His hat and .. a snickers bar? My stomach chose the perfect moment to let out a roar of hunger as I quickly snatched up the candy, practically inhaling it just as quickly as my fingers could unwrap it. My mouth now full and bulging at the sugary treat of the gods, I grasped the red ballcap between my fingers, wincing as I accidently got a smudge of chocolate on the beak of the hat. I twirled it in my hands as I gazed up, the kid now no where in sight and I wasn't any closer to finding water or answers for that matter. My eyes unconsciously returned to the cap, my heart giving a jolt as it felt as though the blood in my veins washed out through the soles of my shoes. On the label of the cap was a name written in ink, faded from the hat's constant wearing, yet quite discernable. Yes, <i>my</i> name. The red ballcap slipped from my fingers as I stared at it in shock, as if expecting it to transform into some sort of creature and bite me on the neck as it sucked at my blood .. except there would be none .. as it would currently be forming a thick and sticky puddle beneath my converse-clad feet. ""Oh hell.""</font>"

"event","<font face=""georgia"" size=""1"">Yay, success! I have finally found my Robert Downey Jr. CD, <i>The Futurist</i>, and ordered it, which I knew I would end up having to do, ordering it online. No stores have it in stock .. I went to Walmart and Target because online it said that they had it and when I in fact got there, I was told you can only order the said CD online. So yesterday I rushed to the store once daddy gave me money from his winnings [I don't understand how they can leave at 11pm and come home at noon the next day after a whole night of gambling] and bought myself a debit card. So with that, I was able to put money on it to order what I needed online. I was actually a bit shocked at how much it costs to engrave jewelry. Anyway, I've got what I needed and the CD should arrive on my doorstep either Wednesday [yes, I have to sound that out .. haha] or Thursday. Exciting! Now all I wish to buy is the Iron Man Soundtrack and I'm all set. The rest of whatever money I happen to recieve or make, once I get my job, I <i>need</i> to save.

"event","<font face=""georgia""><font size=""1"">I would like to just&nbsp;take this moment to say ..&nbsp;that garage sales are <em>completely evil.</em> They can bite my ass. And yes, believe it. Soak it in. Second that opinion. It's true and you know it.<br /><br />First of all, I have not slept since waking up at&nbsp;10&nbsp;am on Friday morning. That's 33 hours I have been awake, minus the actual&nbsp;2 that I managed to squeeze in for a small sort of nap. Honestly, I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know whether to sleep now or wait a few more hours, about 3, so that it is a relatively normal time to go to bed and I don't completely 'screw myself over' with my whole sleeping schedule getting more bizarre that it already is. This has to be our 4th weekend having a garage sale [that's the entire weekend, both saturday and sunday sitting in blistering heat and baking, trying to sell your prized and memory-filled pieces of junk] and I was exhausted with them at the start. All we seem to do is drag everything out the garage, sit there and fry, only to put it all back again after a few people come by. A few words of advice by the way, for those who do go to garage sales. First of all, don't slow down and hover outside the said garage sale and at least get out of your car. You have no idea how frustrating that is when you've had about 3 people come by and either browse or buy one tiny 50 cents worth piece of something or other. Come on, at least get out of the car. Secondly, don't go to garage sales expecting everything to be five dollars because you're a cheap person like that. Not saying you are, just the common few who see something like a Playstation, ask how much its worth and when you say something like $45 when it is worth a hell of a lot more than that, you turn your nose up and walk away.&nbsp;<br /><br />Don't be snooty and demanding. We're baking in the sun. We're tired. We're bored. Give us a break. In fact, we had this woman come buy and I don't think I have met anyone ruder. After buying the very thing I was going to take back inside, before I had the chance to, for a ridiculous price because she was being <em>incredibly</em> rude and blunt about it, she sat in her car then rolled down her window and waved the money to mum. She then had to walk over and take the money, only to be ordered around. ""Get me a bag. I want those oils too."" The way she said it .. wow, just because you are older than most of the people around you and that, it doesn't justify a person's behavior. I was&nbsp;simply appalled. No one orders my mother to do something for them. Who did she think she was?&nbsp;The Queen? Yeah. It's obvious I need sleep and saying that I 'get cranky' is a bit of an understatement.&nbsp;Oh and another thing .. why do most of the weirdos go to garage sales .. ? And on a brighter note, mum made $400 mostly on small things this time such as clothes and shoes. The previous days she simply made just over $100. I wonder why today was so different. We were definitely busy. Anyway, time for another little nap.&nbsp;<em>Cheers.</em>&nbsp;.. ugh, a mojito sounds wonderfully satisfying. <3</font>"

"event","<font face=""georgia"" size=""1"">I want to be a writer, truly, I do. I just don't think I possess the attention span. Perhaps journalism, I'm not entirely sure. Who knows, maybe some fitting career will actually fall into my lap - nothing else ever does, so at least .. I want that to fall into place. If it involves history or writing that would be wonderful, in fact, photography and something that involves me working on film sets would be incredible too. Who knows. I certainly believe, as I have looked back onto previous writing pieces, that I have really developed as writer. Thinking [because as of lately it's all I seem to do] today, I realized that I actually enjoy people watching or studying and observing characters on the television. It makes me wonder if this is why my characters are so detailed and, seemingly, well thought of. I certainly believe that people watching can turn you into a better writer. I love to simply watch and then wonder what their story is .. and it would probably be immensely helpful if I carried around a notebook or something. I always have ideas when I'm out and never have anything to write them down on, thus forgetting whatever the idea was. Another reason I watch [anything really but people are more entertaining] is because you notice extremely strange and bizarre people. 

I remember standing outside the movie theater one day, this woman was standing in line and she had a trail, about several feet, of toilet paper coming from the waistband of her pants. I was so in awe that the woman couldn't feel it or even checked herself before she left the bathroom or that no one around her seemed to have noticed that all I could do was simply stare and laugh. However, looking back upon it now I feel as though I should have told her that it was there. Obviously not around all of the people in line but sort of pull her aside and tell her. I know that I would want someone to do that for me .. not just laugh and stare in shock. Its strange, you see all those commercials about people helping a person instinctively or just because and another person sees it .. then the act spreads and works its way back around to the first person. It's a shame that it doesn't seem to happen too often in life. The world would definitely be a much better place with people and acts of kindness like that. I've learned from my dad to do things like that and occasionally however, I simply seem to forget .. only to be reminded as he does the right thing and helps a person. I look up to him and deeply love him for that and I strive to be that way myself .. whether it's offering a small American flag to a little girl at the park on July 4th because she asks her daddy for one or giving a lei to a little kid in front of me at a hockey game because theirs ripped. I try to do as much as I can because I believe that a person, even if it is only one out of many, will see me and well, pay it forward .. and hopefully, someday it will return to me when I truly need it.</font>"

"event","<font face=""georgia""><font size=""1"">What's the most frustrating thing ever? Having the urge and desire to do something, yet not quite sure what and having absolutely no motivation to do it.. My current mood. For the past few weeks or, actually, the past few months. I've been logging into my livejournal and just looking over it, wondering when something would just wash over me and I'd suddenly have something to write about or actually do it. Nothing. So today, I'm forcing myself to write and it will most likely be absolute crap but at least I've accomplished something and hopefully - just hopefully - I'll get out of this weird little mood. We'll see. Until then, however, I have posts to write and things to catch up on. I have approximately three months until I'll be rendered computerless .. therefore, cram as much as I can and do as much as I can before early August. I'm not sure how long I'll be without a computer; I'm hoping not too long. I can't live without it! &lt;3</font></font>"

"event","<font face=""georgia""><font size=""1"">Applications, fall 2008, internships in Uganda. <br />The organization known as Invisible Children and the video that I first discovered last year during a small class assembly, including ours and about two others, shone a new light upon the whole concept and idea of helping others. I was deeply moved and felt suddenly inspired and motivated by the video that started this whole thing. Ever since I could remember I've had a strong desire to help people, but have never been quite sure with how to go about it, what exactly I should do, or even where to start. The story and documentary that the the college students told and recorded, during an unexpected trip to Uganda and the organization they created thereafter, opened my eyes and shed light upon the events. Hearing only little of the civil war that took place in 1999 in Sierra Leone, I was, needless to say, shocked at hearing that for nearly 22 years, the war in Uganda is still raging. However, it is believed that it is nearing an end. Reconstruction and rebuilding draws closer, yet according to the Invisible Children website, nearly fifty percent of all peace agreements fail to last a decade before war breaks out again. I feel that a purpose in our lives, is to help others. I think that we are supposed to help the next generation and give them a chance to live their lives. Everyone deserves to live their life and some people need our help in starting it. It's not only the children, families, and people in Africa but here in America as well.. and for all we know, they could become someone great; they only need the chance and opportunity to become so. Every war has an end, and the invisible should be seen. <br /><br />'The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.'

"event","<font face=""georgia"" size=""1"">I wrote this originally for a New Amsterdam fanfiction but decided to just leave it. Perhaps I'll add more or create something out of it .. I haven't decided yet. <br /><br />Every day I see him .. his lean figure, dressed neatly in a deep charcoal suit. However, it isn't kept tidy, crisp and pressed; which leads me to the conclusion that he isn't some important political man or a savvy business man. I can only assume that by his sharp, wary eyes and rugged features that he is an officer of the law, quite possibly a detective. He has a strong face, a defined jaw and seemingly deep azure eyes. The cerulean orbs hold a great wisdom and pain to them, as if he has lived through many centuries. He has a straight posture, a composed and confidence stance .. the only thing that gives him away are his eyes. Every day he waits; his gaze focused and transfixed on an old silver pocket watch held between his loose fingers. Occasionally, those deep cerulean orbs roam upward from the slow ticking hands of time with bated breath to see the metallic subway cars unload and refill with busy people. People who are frantic to reach their destination as they pack inside a silver box like a tin of sardines. Yet, he continues to watch and wait .. for something or someone. His eyes grow hopeful and nervous as the next car pulls along and I know that he is waiting for someone as they frantically search the crowd of people pushing their way out of the gleaming silver box. Once again, the people are gone as they slowly trickle away from the car as it continues its repetative route down the darkened, seemingly endless, eternally looped tunnel. This time there is a change in those wise, beryl orbs as they grow distant, as if he is remembering some incident that occured here. I wonder if he will ever see the person he is waiting for .. perhaps an old love, yet one thing is sure .. the rugged and wise man will be waiting, eyes focused on the pocket watch for the slow moving hand to reach two o'clock.</font>"

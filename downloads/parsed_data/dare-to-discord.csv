<P align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Devil is often a great card for business success; hard work and ambition.</font></P>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Perhaps the most misunderstood of all the major arcana, the Devil is not really &quot;Satan&quot; at all, but Pan the half-goat nature god and/or Dionysius. These are gods of pleasure and abandon, of wild behavior and unbridled desires. This is a card about ambitions; it is also synonymous with temptation and addiction. On the flip side, however, the card can be a warning to someone who is too restrained, someone who never allows themselves to get passionate or messy or wild - or ambitious. This, too, is a form of enslavement. As a person, the Devil can stand for a man of money or erotic power, aggressive, controlling, or just persuasive. This is not to say a bad man, but certainly a powerful man who is hard to resist. The important thing is to remember that any chain is freely worn. In most cases, you are enslaved only because you allow it.</font></p>

That's right. The FC is throwing a party and you all are invited. So if you want to kick back for a night in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, you should come on down and party with us. It's going to be one hell of a shindig.

Lucid Discordance 

------------- 

Boys and Ghouls! 

We've been through a lot this year with the verges, the Seers of the Throne, 
and mysterious underground caverns being discovered. Members of The Free 
Council have gotten together and determined that we need to socialize - to 
relax and share in the brotherhood that keeps our community strong. 

We propose a Halloween Party! Come dressed for fun, engage in frivolous 
costumed enjoyment. In the interest of respecting religious or ritual 
diversity, we will be holding this on October 26th and partying through 
until the 27th, leaving plenty of time to make it home for observances you 
may have on the 31st or 1st. 

There will be plenty of room on the estate, so we invite anyone and 
everyone. We recognize that brotherhood and relaxation comes in many forms, 
so several rooms will be set aside to conduct business and see to Order 
affairs. We're realists, we recognize that politicking will occur regardless 
of the event, so we choose to embrace it. 

The only rules we ask is that people do not ruin others' fun. Be respectful 
and follow the golden rule: Don't be tacky! 

Who: Pentacles and Friends! 
What: Halloween Party! COSTUMES ENCOURAGED! 
When: October 26th, 6:00pm until ???? 
Where: The SCHRECKLICH House, Milwaukee Wisconsin 
Why: Because we deserve it, dammit!"

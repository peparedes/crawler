"event","Hmmmm, spring break is a nonstop party.  After four days of double practices, I hopped a plane to Montreal and stayed there for three days.  I checked out McGill, which looks like a fun place to be but the classes I observed weren't that interesting.  Jamie, Anna McDowell and Anna K.E. were on my tour--how weird is that?  Seriously.  Then I bumped into Rina Breakstone, then I called Adam Poole and made him show me around campus.  Montreal is a really cool city but I seriously fail at French.  Anyway, today we drove across eastern Canada to Toronto and now I'm hiding in the basement avoiding my relatives with whom we are staying.  An incident at my grandfather's 80th birthday last week sparked World War III between my mom and all her siblings, and I REALLY don't want to get in the middle of it.  BUT we're going to see NYU on Monday, which will be awesome.  I love cool cities.  Oh, and it's snowing all the time here.  Craaaaazy.

P.S.  What chapters are we supposed to read for AP Gov't?  When is Carton's essay due?  Do we have a Latin test on the chapters we're reading in English/if so, when?  Basically, total amount of homework done to date=zero."

"event","Yes, this is going to be one of <i>those</i> posts, wherein I bitch about my life.  You ready?

Yesterday my mother forced me to stay home for Yom Kippur.  'How delightful, a day at home', you may say.  But I knew better.  I awoke at 5:40 for crew, and returned home at 8:15.  As soon as I got back, I cracked open my econ book and got through all but three pages of chapter 17.  Once I could no longer decipher the words on the page, I turned to Latin, translating two assignments.  Then, on my mother's strict orders, I spent a solid hour organizing a closet downstairs (as if I didn't have enough to do), then took out all the garbage in the house.  At 1:30, I went to the synagogue to pick up my brother, and we spent a half-hour counting cars for the Beth El parking committee (again, my mother's idea).  When we got back, I started my Bible as Lit homework, which Carton had assigned despite the fact that a) it was Yom Kippur and b) he himself had not been in class for the past week.  At 5:15 I went to rehearsal, which lasted until 8, by which time I was <i>starving</i>.  Then I organized college envelopes well into the wee hours (i.e. 11:30, which seems pretty late when you've been up since 5:40).  And I still wasn't done.

The point of all this is that it seems like we don't have any free time anymore.  I took a whole day off of school, and STILL didn't get everything done.  And whenever I have a short break between assignments, I feel like I should be working on college essays, or something.  I'm getting so far behind in my classes, or just barely keeping my head above water.  Somebody tell me I'm not crazy?

I miss <i>people</i>, like normal human interaction outside a classroom setting.  I haven't done anything with anyone for a really long time, and I wish I could, but there's just so much going on.  I don't think I've even seen a movie since school started.

P.S.  I miss Neal.  The play is no fun without him.  Just thought I'd put that out there while I'm being angsty."

"event","So, Jordan had his bar mitzvah on Saturday.  It was really cute, and he did really well, and the party was really fun, but I hated having all the relatives around.  You know how when a ton of old people come to visit, you kind of feel like you're in a zoo?  Like, they keep staring at you, and taking pictures, and you know they're whispering stuff like ""Ohhh, she's so big!"" and ""Isn't she <i>pretty</i>"" and ""Wow, look at that exotic plumage!"" (okay, maybe not the last one, but...).  It sucks.  Also, I'm sick of talking about camp.  Everybody's like ""Wow, that must have been fun!"", and I either have to say ""Well, actually, no, it wasn't,"" or just kind of mumble something noncommittal and vague.  Or I could just lie, but that always leads to more questions.

Everybody left this morning (thank God) except my aunt and her two kids: Hannah (5) and Nathan (7 months?ish).  They're both dangerously cute, but Hannah follows me around practically nonstop and it gets really annoying.  Fortunately, our neighbors just got back from France, and they have a 5-year-old daughter too, so maybe I'll get a little peace now.  Also, it's really awkward carrying Nathan around, because I can tell people wonder if he's mine.  I was wheeling him through Target today, and these people were staring at us, and I was like ""he's not my baby..."" and then I felt even more awkward.  Goooood times.

I'm really excited for my 100k bike ride next weekend.  I've decided to try to set up a road biking club this year (for real this time).

Speaking of (shudder) school, can someone copy the AP French reading for me?  Or let me borrow it so I can copy it myself?  Or something?  I have to start remembering French.

Fox was a cutie in his day).  Then I dragged myself away from the TV to go to the gym.  My new plan is that I eat whatever the fuck I want (ice cream by the quart, basically.

So here's the Indy rundown: Last Monday we left camp and flew to Indianapolis.  We raced hella times in heats, semis and finals.  I went down the course seven times, plus two or three practices.  I ended up with two medals (both bronze, but whatever, it's Nationals).  Yesterday was a college fair thingy, so we schmoozed with coaches and signed a bunch of mailing lists.  Then last night we stayed up really late (12:30.  Is it sad that that's late for me now?) talking about cocaine and bestiality (I have NO idea why) and then went to the airport this morning and left and now I'm HOME, for the first time in FIVE WEEKS.  I can't believe it.  I keep thinking I have to go get ready for practice, but I don't.  How <i>glorious</i>.

Highlights of Nationals:
-seeing the Southeast boys from last year (can we say ""mmmmmmmm""?)
-going 6:38 in the eights final
-two medals!!!
-being ""the"" team (you know, the one where everybody looks at you and goes ""oh shit, we have to race them?"")
-being semi-recruited (by the Yale coach!!!)
-boys everywhere
-being done with practice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So.  I'm home, finally.  I didn't realize how much I love Berkeley until I went to New London.  But now I'm back for the rest of the summer, and I'm really going to enjoy not doing anything.  If anyone is around and not off trotting around the globe, let me know!  I want to be around normal people (read: non-crew people) for a while now."

Last weekend we went to Boston and wandered around.  It's such a great city.  Harvard Square is fun, but we also went to Boston Common and Newbury St., this really fancy street with a bunch of expensive stores and stuff.  It was fun.  Then yesterday we went to the movies.  I saw The Devil Wears Prada.  It was cute.  A bit predictable, sure, but good mindless entertainment.  It was nice to get out of Conn College, anyway.

This morning we had a coxswain 500m erg race.  1:57.3, bitch.  I won by 8 seconds.  Sweet.

Oh, but yesterday I went to yoga and it was really really nice.  Today, every muscle in my body was sore.  I really need to do that more often.

I really don't want it to rain tomorrow.  Like, <i>really</i>.  Especially because I think I'm walking to school.

Totally forgot that I had math homework this weekend.  Yeah, that's not happening right now.

Goodnight."

I'm really tired right now, but I don't want to go to bed because I don't have to wake up for practice tomorrow.  Tomorrow is Novice Regatta.  Then Sunday is Norcal vs. Socal round robin, which should be fun.  Except that I have to call my boat tomorrow night and make sure they're not out partying and shit.  I hate calling people.  Most nontriumphant.

Math test is over, which is a big relief.  I love weekends.  Also, I decided to give up on my dance, which is nice, because I don't have to stress about choreographing stuff anymore.

Then I drove to Marin and got new cycling gloves, and was hit on by a cute smoothie guy at Planet Juice (I think.  Either that or he was just very customer-service oriented).  Then I drank a mocha milkshake and drove home.  I kind of ran a red light, because I am a very bad driver.  Yellow lights suck ass.  That part was most heinous.  But I like the freeway.

Anybody want Orlando Bloom staring at them while they sleep?  Oh yeah, and I won a rocket pen and a jar of peanuts.  It was entertaining.

Winter break is really boring, but it's still better than the alternative.  Right now I have to wait until Jordan stops watching Aladdin so I can practice bass.  I really want to be in a band, but a) I'm not very good, b) there's nobody to play with, and c) I can't write songs.  I went to Guitar Center with my dad and Jordan and Patrick (my dad's girlfriend's son), and it was so intimidating because there were all these really good musicians trying out $2000 guitars and shit, and I was like, guh?

I really wanted a car for Christmas, but I didn't get one.  Not like I really expected to or anything, but it would have been nice.  Driving is fun.

1. you, in haiku form. Go!
hopeless romantic
perpetually tired
so sick of trying

2. What is your favorite thing about theater? 
I love being a part of a big production, especially when nobody thinks we can pull it together and then we do it.  There's such a sense of accomplishment.  And I especially love the opportunities it allows for doing totally crazy things that I'd probably never do in real life.(i.e. basically all of JCS).  I dunno, it's hard to pick a favorite part, I love all of it.

3. What is the first memory that comes to mind when I say ""growth""?
When I was probably around 7 or 8, I kept hitting my various appendages and tripping over things and generally being not-so-graceful.  My mom was sick of me whining about my injuries, and she kept telling me I was having a growth spurt.

4. Describe a possible 30-year-old Erin.
Oh, geez, I dunno.  I'm sure I'll be wearing a tailored black suit, possibly with pinstripes.  I might be a stockbroker or lawyer, or something.  Hopefully living on the east coast or in London or possibly Paris.  I'd like to be married, or at least in a long-term relationship, but no kids, nohow.  I'd very much like to be one of those really stylish types who always looks put together, and lives in a shiny, chic flat in a metropolitan epicenter.

5. Has your new haircut changed anything about you?
Oh, definitely.  I'm so much more confident and I feel more grown-up.  Also, since I cut my hair, people have told me I look good much more often, which is nice, and contributes to the confidence thing.  I'm a bit less reserved, meaning I'm not always the one sitting in the corner being quiet and nervous.  Sometimes, but not always.  Basically, I like my haircut."

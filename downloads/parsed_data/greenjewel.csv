<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/P/PainfulBliss/1113098060_uote.love2.JPG"" border=""0"" alt=""Love.Life""><br>Your wise quote is: ""Love is life. And if you<br>miss love, you miss life"" by Leo Buscaglia. <br>Yes, love is indeed what you desire in your life. If you have it or not is another matter, but it is in your eyes the most important feeling. You tend to be a romantic dreamer and want you and your love to have that kind of perfect love that you hear about in fairytales. However that can be hard to find, but it doesn't mean you are going to stop looking.

You are constantly hurt and depressed... No one seems to understand how you feel because everyone is scared to get close to you... You long to be able to reach out and tell someone everything, and all of your problems... But you have no one to tell, or they just don't seem to want to hear what you have to say. You've been hurt many times that you don't seem to have any tears left to shed, or if you do, they're an endless river flowing... You've started to hide and bottle up all or your problems and feelings, hoping that maybe they just will go away... You want company, but at the same time, you're scared of it. Your sanctuary is your room where you can just be alone and try to throw away all of your aching pains. You're dark and mysterious and people like you for that reason. Even if you think you're all by yourself in the dark, someone is always there with you. Your special someone wants to admit and show their feelings towards you, but they're afraid of how you'll take it. Get out more and enjoy life because, it is far too long to frown your way through :)

<TD>You are more introverted than extroverted. You are more intuitive than observant, you are more feeling based than thinking based, and you prefer to go with the flow rather than having a plan. Your type can best be summarized by the word ""Healer"", which belongs to the larger group of idealists. You have a capacity for caring that is deeper than most. You strive for unity, are fascinated by the battles between good and evil, and can be something of an idealist. Only 1% of the population shares your type.<BR>As a romantic partner, you are usually supprtive and nuturing, however, you have a high need for individuality. Harmony is extremely important to you as you are very affected by conflict and tension, which also makes you resist confronting your partner directly about problems. When you get angry, you usually blame yourself, rather than your partner. You can also be stubborn and unyielding when you feel you are being criticized or mistreated. You feel the most appreciated when your partner listens to you carefully. You need to be understood. You need to hear your partner express their feelings, the more often, the better.

"event","I'm in a state of confusion. Like that's anything new. Things are, just, strange right now. I think that's because for once everything in my life is starting to look up. I know that it won't last for long. Maybe a day or two. If I'm lucky, it'll last a week. Nah, nothing in my life goes the way that I want it to. Oh, well. The glass is definately half empty.

Anywho, made it to the semi finals of Twin Ports Idol. Performed at Grandma's Sports Garden last Thursday. I guess it went well. Made my mom cry. That's a plus. Getting tired of singing though. Not as fun as it used to be. I dunno. I think I'm in a creative rut. I can't write, can't sing, can't even color.... and I LOVE TO COLOR!!!! Could it be because, like I said earlier, that my life is starting to go right? Hmmmm... lemme think on this.... life goes right, lose creativity. Dunno if I like that one yet. It might grow on me. Nah, it won't. I'd miss my music and poetry too much. 

Now I'm starting cross stitch. It's supposedly a calming thing. IT TAKES TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION!!!!!! That's no fun. I'm only doing it for my parents anniversary. Grrr. No fun at all. 

I hate this fucking weather!!!! Warm one minute, the next the wind comes off of the lake and it gets colder than a mother fucker. Well, I suppose... now that I've become a day-walker I should get to bed. Grrrr.... all that sunlight makes me cranky. Later."

So, not much is going on. I auditioned for Juliard. That was fun, but completely exhausting. Also very nerve racking. I find out next month whether I go back for the next round of auditions. If I do, and survive, I'll be going to Juliard this fall! If I don't, then I know there are things that I need to work on. 

In other news, my brother's coming home for the holidays!!!! Too bad he's not 21. I could take him to work with me to celebrate the New Year. I think he's getting engaged to his high school sweetheart, the poor sap. Love is a great thing. It makes for great poetry when it's over.

Speaking of which......... I have a new poem. It's called Alone. I was kinda depressed when I wrote it.

Smiling, alone
Laughing, alone
Loving, alone
Always, alone

Dark is my soul
Filling with hate
Death is its goal
Pain is my fate

I feel the pain
Surrounding me
Sadness will reign
For I am not free

Let in the sun?
There is no time
Wish I could run
Why? Because I'm

Crying, alone
Wishing, alone
Dying, alone
Always, alone

What do you think? Lemme know. In other news, I've got the chance to record my poetry. I want my friend Kris to play the music for the background. IF I can ever get in touch with him and IF he'll agree to do it. I think it would be fun. Anyway, enough babbling for now. I will talk to those in cyberspace later."

Which sucks cause I didn't get a chance to say good bye. Mom's worried that he's going to get shipped overseas. I mean, I hope he doesn't, but I can't stop him from going either.

Anyway, my friend Ben is in town. That's cool as hell. I haven't seen him for a while. I'm kinda excited. Kinda trying to set him up with one of my friends, at his request, of course. I would never fling pretty available girls at him. Honest. No sarcasm involved. So, that's kinda what I'm doing. Not really. I think I know someone where they would be good for each other. Not many times do I get to do something like that.

Side note. I'm trying to type this without looking at my hands. I'm doing alright I guess. I can find most of the letters without much of a problem. My fingers are starting to cramp, though, Grr. Anyway, I've got to get to bed. I have a GREAT FUN thing I get to do tomorrow. I get to sit at 'the wall' all day with a bunch of whiny brats. I'd rather not. I just want a nice quiet day to myself. Remember, I'm a really shy person, and to be thrown into social situations where I don't know barely any of the people that are there... it's awkward. I can't even leave. I've got the car seat and my roommate and her kids would have no way to get back. Fucking conscience. I'm going to have to find a book to read. Later."

They told me I was going to the fucking finals. It's not my fault that my mother works there. Shit, if they want their fucking trophy back, I'll stick it up their ass for them. Stupid sons of bitches. Fucking natives... I say that and I'm 1/8th native..... tells you how much I love that. I should get going. I'm going to try to sleep this off. The shaking's bothering me.

Now I need to take care of my last loose end. This is the one that I'm dreading. I've put it off for so long because it's not the easiest one to deal with. I can deal with having someone yell and scream at me, I can deal with someone treating me like shit. I can't, however, deal with someone I know so well and that I loved for so long, when I don't know how I'm going to react. The hardest thing is having to look that person in the eye and tell them that I don't love them anymore.  Was it an addiction that never goes away, or was it obsession? I don't know. How do you deal with someone that was the inspiration of all the poetry that you wrote? How do you deal with someone that you know better than you know yourself? How do you deal with someone that you gave your soul to? Especially when the last time you saw them, you ran away crying because you felt your world was crashing down around you? I don't know. If I could forget the past, hell, if everyone could forget the past life would be so much easier. Anyway, I should get going. I've got a shit load of things to do later."

It sounds corny, I know, but it's true.

On the flip side, I still hate people. Jake and Kris and Kat. Though not so much Kris, but I am starting to get annoyed again. Being lied to by those three is not an uncommon occurrence. Do people honestly think that I'm so gullible that I'm not going to find out the truth sooner or later? I mean seriously. I'm not that stupid. I've come to learn in the past few months that trust is something that must be earned over a number of years, not given immediately. Geez, I'm tired of the rat race of an 	existence. Tired of being played, used, and abused. So, if I become a bitch, those are the three you can blame."

Wait a minute
What did you say
Did I hear you say
There's no real reason left for you to stay?
Under your breath I hear your soft voice break
Can we still be friends
I hear you talking but you're just not making sense
I've been hoping for a happy ending
Now I know that there won't be any

Just a few words too many in my head
A few words too many in this bed
A few words too many left unsaid
Oh I wish that we were strangers
We could start again
Start again all over again

A broken shadow falls across your face
As you hesitate
Trying to think of all the things you need to say
Bare face the truth lies at my feet
As you turn away
Sometimes silence has a way of making peace
I've been hoping for a happy ending
Now I knew that there won't be any

Just a few words too many in my head
A few words too many in this bed
A few words too many left unsaid
Oh I wish that we were strangers
We could start again
Start again all over again

Staring at the ceiling
Wondering just what you're feeling
Was it me
Or was it you
What's the difference
If I knew

Maybe I wouldn't feel so empty
If I had heard a few words too many in this bed
A few words too many left unsaid
Oh I wish that we were strangers
We could start again
Start again all over again"

Higher than it's ever been. The doctor checked me for food poisoning and the flu, but that wasn't it. He even checked me for drugs. It came back negative. They did some cat scans on my abdominal area. It's not my stomach, or my appendix. Or my ovaries, for once. The blackouts, throwing up blood, sleeping for days at a time, body temperature dropping.... He said there's a possibility that I have a serious disease. I go back on Friday for more extensive blood work. He wanted to give it some time to see if my body evens itself out. 

My parents and friends tell me not to worry about it. I may have just caught a cold and it hasn't made itself know yet. I hope so. If there was ever a time that I needed a shoulder to cry on, it would be now. I wish I had someone I could just let go with. Pretending that I'm not bothered by this is exhausting. I'm scared.

Anyway, moral dilemnas aside, I cut 4 inches off my hair a couple days ago. I just couldn't stand having it that long anymore. It was tickling my lower back. That was annoying. God, is it short, though. Oh well.... it'll GROW on me :) Actually, I think I like it this length. It's too short to be annoying, but long enough that it's not creating spiral curls everywhere.

Okay, I was reading the last few entries and I didn't like the way they sounded. So, truth. On April 22 is the finals for the karaoke contest at Charlie's Bar on 56th and Grand. Which is, wow, 13 days away. The only reason I entered the contest is because 3 of my friends thought it would be the perfect revenge if I happened to place higher than Kat, who made it into the finals a week prior. The pre-lims are held on Thursdays at 8pm, and the winner on April 22 wins $400. Winning the money would be nice, but kicking Kat's ass would be better.

Before the magazines brought in the razor blades, and the sweet smell of corruption.
I can't remember what the world looks like,
Through eyes unjaded.
Eyes that don't compare or loathe,
Or lose there shine when the camera turns away.
Forgotten again what the truth sounds like.
The sincerity that was flushed down the toilet long ago.
Before I purged my soul with discontent,
I remember the words that used to escape these sinful lips.

I wrote a poem the other day.  This is the first time that a poem of mine doesn't rhyme.  It really doesn't have a sense of meter either.  It sounded good at the time. I dunno, you tell me.

I do not dream of you;
You do not lend yourself to a rhetoric
But move in calligraphic paths
Untraceable with words
Beautiful to behold
Drawn with a master's touch.

I dream of small gray birds
With dark-streaked wings cupped in my hands;
I fling them out to fly,
Leaving barbs and thorns upon my fingers.
I move between the pain of touch and the joy of sight:
The etching of those bodies on the sky.

I do not dream of you
But of the mysteries you hold me in,
With feathers, winds, and wizardry,
Yet if I were to speak of it,
My voice would gleam in hard, bright fragments
That you could not hope to catch or comprehend."

I've been there... hell, I just got out of that situation.  I wish that I could talk to them and tell them to calm down and think smart.

Anyway, I had a set back last night.  I thought that I was in control of myself.  I'm not.  I haven't had the money to get my drugs.  I'm starting to revert back to the way that I was.  I need my drugs.  I'm getting over emotional and I'm having problems keeping myself together.  I lost my temper again.  It scared me.  I lost my cool composure.  Part of it was talking to someone that I wasn't ready to talk to.  Dregging up things that I'm not ready to deal with.  Feeling things that I'm not ready to feel.  Reliving memories that I'm not ready to face.  Closing those emotions behind a door isn't healthy, but for my sense of self and my sense of well being, that's what I have to do."

"event","Hi!  I'm back!  I've been gone for a while doing some healing.  I'm not done yet, but I'm back now!  I'm feeling a lot better, and I'm ready to start a new phase of my life.  To hear from my friends, and I quote 'IT'S ABOUT TIME'!  

ANYWAY.... so, yeah.  What brought this on?  Well, losing two people that I love, losing my job, and losing my health.  I figure that in a month, that's enough loss.  I took that as a sign to turn my life around.  While I still have work to do, I'm not as stressed or as lost as I was.

So, where am I going now?  I'm going to start focusing on me.  One of my friends told me, 'You're not ready for any kind of serious relationship.  Even though I know you want to be loved by someone, you have too much you need to do with your life to turn your life over to someone else'.  

Well, given my tendency to spin my life around the one(s) that I love, that's advice that I'm definitely going to take.  Does that mean that I'm going to become a cold or empty person?  Never.  I still care about my friends.  I still feel emotions for a certain individual.  When or if I fall in love again, I'm not going to make them my entire life.  I can't.  It's not healthy for me, and it's not healthy for the relationship.  

So I apologize to my former love.  I've learned that you were right.  A relationship is about two people staying themselves and becoming a unit.  Each person respecting the other's boundaries and sharing a deeper part of themselves.  It's not about one person trying to conform themselves to fit completely into the other's life and therefore losing their own identity.  It's a lesson that I've learned too late.  Maybe in a few months after I've healed some more, we should get together and talk.  I think that would be nice.

Okay, back to my life.  The journey that I'm about to take is going to be a long and possibly trying time for me.  I'm going to ask my friends and family to have some patience with me as I continue my healing.  I want to say thanks to everyone that has stood by me so far.  It hasn't been a fun ride.  To those that have decided to pass from my life, I want to thank them as well.  Even if they don't know it, they have helped me  immensely.  They have taught me some very hard and valuable lessons.  I hope that one day they will decide to come back into my life.  Thank you guys."

I never knew how to fight myself. I learned how to do that today. Nothing can bother me right now. Not my feelings. Not other people's feelings. I'm in a very happy place right now. All without chemical enhancements. :) Makes me happy."

"event","Oh god. Guess what? It looks like I got sucked into the world of quizzes. Here are the ones that I took and my comments on each.
-->While I have to admit, most quizzes that I take are a very inaccurate picture of what I'm feeling and the type of person that I am....well, that and the fact that I hate them with a passion..... this one hit it right on the button. 
<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/C/chaoscomesatnite/1069289480_CMyDocumentswwwwww.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""goodbroken""><br>Your wings are <b>BROKEN</b> and tattered. You are<br>an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for<br>one reason or another - possibly, you made one<br>tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or<br>maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't<br>commit. In any case, you are faithless and<br>joyless. You find no happiness, love, or<br>acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most<br>days are a burden and you wonder when the<br>hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and<br>sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching<br>picture. You are the one that few understand.<br>Those that do know you are likely to love you<br>deeply and wish that they could do something to<br>ease your pain. You are constantly living in<br>memories of better times and a better world.<br>You are hard on yourself and self-critical or<br>self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved,<br>you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite<br>your tainted nature, your soul is<br>breathtakingly beautiful.
-->OKAY, I know that I said that I HATE quizzes, but this one was just funny..... true, but funny none the less.

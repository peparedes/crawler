"event","So last night I went on a date with Nicole.  She is the girl I met on saturday night at the Mr. Drag King Show.  I was dressed in drag and still managed to pick someone up.  Edurne and my sister came along with me and took it upon themselves to make fun of me and my pimp ways.  I cant help it, but if I see something I want, I go for it.  And every once and awhile, I get the girl in the end.  I met Nicole outside her job and we had a little dinner and drinks at Mixto.  I am really starting to like that place.  I went there with Yexsy the first time and even though she refers to it as the ""white latin"" restaurant (which it is!) I still enjoy it.  Nicole is an painter and had to put her painting up at North Bar on South street.  I joined her.  So you know...by the time this happen, we had both had about 6 beers.  Needless to say, we had dropped our guard and were becoming a little friendlier.  We kissed but that was it.  I promised that I would have any one night stands/ or random hook ups until amanda gets accepted to Berkeley.  This is not necessary a bad thing.  Im suppose to see Nicole some time tonight at her bar and I will attend her art openning on thursday night.  Im going to try my best to get to knew her before we move any further.  (Yes people I am growing up) Actually, the last time I had a one night stand, I feel like I really hurt someone.  And it turned out that I didnt just hurt that person, but someone else who a close friend.  

At the end of the night, the only person I could think about was Manda.  That girl has such a hold on my heart.  I told myself that I am going to marry her.  I just didnt realize that it wasnt going to be this hard."

"event","I truly love this country and their ability to turn any event into a
drinking party.  This recent event is me moving home and eveyone wants
to celebrate...EVERY NIGHT!!  Its great...its like college.  The only
difference is that they dont seem to have the tolerance that I have so
they get drunk way faster than me. But I am not allowed to stop until
I am drunk. (and i didnt make my rule up myself).  
Plus my friends and I all agree that Japanese people dont
get hungover!  The number 1 difference is that in college, when you
wake up feeling like hell, no one chews you out for showing up late
still smelling like a bar. (thats if u even make it to class that day)
This morning I got the scolding from hell bc I was late and missed my
goodbye speech to the kids.  And I honestly didnt know that it was
going to be at 830 in FUCKING MORNING!! Regardless, they had me in tears.  (oh and I didnt
show up smelling like a bar)  The funniest part is...today is my last
day teaching..ever."

"event","Spring is definately on its way!  I can feel it and let me just tell you, I am loving it!  Japan in spring is one of the best places on the planet.  Just a couple more weeks and it will be full on spring loving!  

Today I went to the cafeteria for the first time!  It only took me about a year to get up there, but whatever.  One teacher asked me why i had never came before and I said bc the students all watch me eat and it feels strange.  So i rather eat downstairs in peace.  And as I was saying this, the entire lunchroom was staring at me!!  

I went with Tomita Sensei who wanted to give me a history lesson on Iwamura city.  Last sunday we took a trip there and I really fell in love with this place.  It is the only place in Japan were the Shogun was a woman and thus women are more important than men.  I cant explain, but this place just had a interesting aura to it.  (oh god...did I just use the word aura?)  So I wanted to know more about this place.  But then Naoko showed up!!  I was very pleased bc I like when I get to spend time with her.  She is happy to have a foreigner friend to joke around with and I am just pleased to be sitting that close to a hot girl (who doesnt mind me sitting that close).  But we both got sucked into this Japanese history lesson by Tomita-sensei and wasnt able to talk much.  As a result, Naoko was distracted by a fellow female gym teacher.  Grrr!  I was angry.  I dont like this other gym teacher very much.  

Anyway...after lunch, we all returned to the teachers room (which is where I had preferred to be all along) and Tomita senseir turned to me and said ""you know are kotawaru!""  Ok so I had no idea was kotawaru was, but after soom explanation, we both agreed that it meant obsessive personality.  Which in turn, I simply replied ""yeah, i already know"".  I thought it was best not to continue on the statement by saying that i was obsessed with my obsessive personality."

"event","My headache has finally went away and after the proper serving of greasy mos burger I am not able to function like a normal being.  Last night was crazy.  Starting with dinner with Eva and Dan at this posh izakaya where everything we wanted, they had, but was not listed anywhere on the menu.  It was confusing and annoying.  But they had beer...so we kept our whining to a minimum.  After that we met up with Alberto and headed over to My Bar.  Amaru was there.  I wont go into details.  But besides the fact that her sister hates me and wants to have my head on a stick...Amaru still wants me.  I am not about to break up a family.  At least not when Im leaving in 3 weeks.  After Alberto and Eva departed (i really need more friends who can hang out past the last train home), Aimee and Nicole showed up and the partying began.  I got drunker and hit on Amaru some more.  After breaking a glass and causing drunken havoc, we left to go dancing.  We ended up at The Underground.  For all of you that know the underground...I know I know...that place sucks.  But thats where we wondered off to.  Im pretty positive that I wont be going back there.  

The rest of the night is a big blur.  When I woke up with a throbbing headache, details of the night become irelevant.  I planned to have lunch with Dez.  Val showed up...and I shouldnt have been surprised.  I just really wasnt in the mood.  Food helped...but not really.  I treated myself by buying the new J. Lo CD.  Call me cheezy!  I like her and I have to always support my fellow ricans.  She reminds me of home and right now home is just what I need.  

This could be just me, but I am so disappointed that I asked them to do me a favor and it had to be discussed and thought over.  Only to never really come to a conclusion.  Perhaps I was asking for too much?  Nah...I just have to realize that people arent as generous as me sometimes.  I may have grew up in a deprived environment in north philly, but I was blessed and scared with the notion that we help each other out.  Because that was the only thing my community did right.  We took care of each other if it was in our power.  Is it about time that I stop being so generous to others?  

Back to hungover saturday.  This day is almost over."

"event","Why do I feel like im being watched and judged by everyone?!!  And not just the people around me, but anyone who knows of my existance here and home.  Like I have become that girl that ppl joke about when her name is mentioned.  Or when someones says, hey what about tiffany, the other person says...Oh, yeah be careful with that one.  And I will admit that I have made some mistakes, but i have learned and im making for the better.  learning to be alone and actually really enjoying it.  learning to play the field and not letting the drama get to me.  Finding my goal and going for it.  But...I cant shake those eyes.  They haunt me in my dreams.  And I have never been someone to really care what other's thoughts, but the thought that i cant defend myself is disturbing.  Like they smile in my face and then turn around and speak bad things about me.  Like its all one sided.  No one every asked me what I thought or how I felt or why I did the things I did.  They just labeled me the bad guy that is to be dealt with cautiously.  

Nothing bothers me more than somone who pretends to be supportive, but when u ask for support they suddenly dont want anything to do with it.  yeah, thanks for the support buddy.  Oh when someone asks if u are ok, but if u say no then they decide they dont want o be involved.  Then why did u ask?!!  

But I can live with that.  But I cant live with the embarrassment and thoughts of outcast.  How do I set my side straight (even if I do say that I was the corporate)?  And will ppl believe me?   Do they believe me now?  Do they even see what has changed?  I have this strong feeling that they wont.  And i will always be ""that girl""."

oh wait...the little man in my head is taking a break at banging away at my brain and its all making sense now.  i woke up this morning in kakegawa!!  yes i know...dont be shocked.  i wasnt kidnapped by those country folks..i actually went there last night for a wedding party.  I still cant believe that sugiyama san and hanako got married!!!  being in the tradition of any japanese party...i was wasted.  hence waking up in complete confusion.  5 hours later i am back in nagoya in my cozy apartment.  dez is still in america so its quiet and lonely. its been a week so i can official say that i miss her and cant wait till she comes back.  

the highlight is in 4 hours i will be meeting up with the cute french girl that i met at metro two weeks ago.  we are finally going to go out on a date.  i have been waiting patiently for this chick to see me.  my curiousity is peaked.  who knows what the evening will unveil.  WEEEE!!!"

i made the decision to be more of an activist and became that girl that was always giving her ""how i can fix my country"" speak...aka...why i hate bush.  its like the song goes...i have become everything i hated.   i have calm that down a bit mainly bc i only have 3 english speaking friends here and well, japanese people just dont get it.  and in all honesty...dont want to hear it.  my friends agree with me, so im preaching to the wrong crowd.  

now the next move i make?  i become addicted to airamerica.com and now i find myself listening to news radio all day.  im about 2 months away from 24 years old.  is that was 24 is all about?!!!  

i went from a lonely single life to several people being on my list of interest.  i dont want a relationship.  i cant handle them.  but it definitely nice to have someone to flirt with and feel attractive again.  

i am finally finding independence.  i thought i always was, but its amazing what u will tell urself to hide ur co-dependency.  lets just hope that i am keep growing and not fall back into old patterns.

"event","I did what I have been needing to do for years.  Got some things off my chest.  When I was done my body was hot and red with embarrassment.  Its funny how you get used to just not saying anything.  And how you promise yourself that one will would know.  Or you tell yourself that you can keep a secret.  Yet, it only eats away at you.  hopefully I can continue on with my life now without the need/urge/desire.  I know one thing...when I woke up this morning, I breathed and for the first time in years, the air was breathable.  Its like I cant let go of certain things until I have accomplished my goal.

Lets see if things change.  It what was funny and cute before suddenly becomes strange and uncomfortable.  Im hoping it doesnt.  Bc right now I dont regret anything.

"event","waking up this morning to rain.  didnt think much of it, bc i woke up late and had to run and get dress.  I get 5 mins away from the school and they tell me that school is cancel due  to typhoons.  SWEEETTT!!!  So back home I go.  3rd day without  working.  honestly, if i dont work tomorrow, there is really no point in me going to work on friday.  

Since I had another day off, I gave my parents a call.  For the first time in awhile, I had a good conversation with my parents that didnt turn into yelling and fighting.  I talked to them about me wanting to get into non-profits, going to grad school for political science, wanting to be more of an activist, and of course, me and my guitar.  I was surprised bc they were really happy to hear what i was saying and supported me completely.  I have this feeling that my sister talked to them about not supporting me with my decisions.  Whatever it may be, i still felt good for them to be supportive and not lecture me.  

Tomorrow back to work.  Apparently there is another typhoon coming!!!  That woud be perfect!!  But I wont wish too hard for it.  You have to be careful what u wish for."

on another note...this finding a bar situation is stressing me out.  its like this city has nothing.  and the few people i know that could help with this either dont get back to me, or just dont know where to go.  i cant spend all my money going to tokyo just to hang out at womens bars.  im going to go crazy if i dont find something soon.

i wrote my first song.  music, lyrics, and all.  its so folky, its almost sickening.  but thats what came out of me, so thats what i have to go with.  its progress and thats the important part."

Waking up hungover with only 3 hours of sleep and a black eye from the dummer of Chimaira flinging it into the audience is the fucking pits!  But it was all worth it.  And the band made up for the damage by letting me hang out with them.  

One question...why do guys feel like they have to sleep with every chick they see at a rock show?!!  Damn...let im here for the music.  Not to hook up with you.  

For the 3rd time, I got to go to work with a black eye.  Everyone must think that I have an abusive boyfriend or that my roommate Dez(Dezklr) beats the crap out of me on a weekly basis.  I should just start telling them that I fell down the stairs.  i mean, if u are going to play the part...

This hangover doesnt want to leave.  I finally did get rid of my headache by eatting the magic chili beans that d-money makes.  yummmy!  I think we should start jarring that stuff and selling it at college dorms!  

Oh the hightlight of my night was when both dez and I realizing that the same Japanese dude had been trying to grind up against us and grabbing our boobs in the pit.  we just looked at each other and start punching and kick the dude in the back.  one good punch in the kidneys and the dude was done for the night.  prick!!"

"event","sitting in my friend olivia apartment in tokyo to begin my summer vacation.  actually, this is the first day since my vacation started that i have been busy doing a bunch of nothing.  i arrived her two days ago, and hung out of the gay and lesbian film festival with my tokyo friends.  it was a good time.  i was upset that olivia had to go home early, but i cant make her stay i guess.  

tonight is Kris birthday and we are heading to a mexican dinner to celebrate.  im going to try and keep to my diet while im on vacation but its really hard.  my find myself not eating then eating crap.  gots to figure out a way to eat health and still have fun.  i think i read somewhere that fajitas arent too bad as long as you dont eat the cheese, quacomole, and sour cream (i mean...take the fun of a fajita why dont you!).  

oh...some good news.  Chevy kun has risen from the dead.  Dez called me yesterday morning to let me know that she found my bike near our house.  someone definately did steal it, but my baby put up a fight until the creep finally gave up.  

welcome home sweetie...i promise to give you a bath and a treat once i get back to nagoya."

Sometimes being a teacher is awesome...if you dont count the fact that i actually have to teach and interact wth children everyday.  im really just preparing myself for NOT having kids.  I see what happens to them as they get older and I would hate to one day have to claim one of those brats at my own.  

So my vacation is starting off pretty shit. I have had an sprained ankle all week.  I thought it was broken and spent last saturday at the hospital.  Its not broken.  but it sure as hell feels like it sometimes.  Today, I cant find my bike.  That can mean that it was stolen, but I dont want to believe that yet.   Its just been misplaced.  i swear it will pop up like everything else that I lose.  I mean....ITS A BIKE...they dont just blend into the crowd.  Im trying not to be upset and mad about this, especially since dez said she could get one from ikue.  its just that me and chevy kun (my missing bike) have been through a lot together.  thru thick and thin. summer and winter.  frost bit and sweat.  me and that bike have taken the walk to shame home together many early mornings.  and stumbled home drunk together many late nights.  its will be truely missed.  thats if it doesnt find its way home.

Lately, my guitar as been my only way to escape those things in my life that i cant control.  those things that i dont quite understand.  those things that are hurting me.  those things that are pleasuring me.  it has become my new tormentor, that haunts me night and day."

"event","Im about to sit down and relax.  This new school is definitely a lot different than where I thought in Kakegawa.  For one, I actually work a normal day.  And you know what...it feels weird.  Like, what happen to all my down time?!!!  The good thing is that time goes by so far.  Before I know it, its 4:00 and time for me to go home.  Its about 3:45 now and soon I will be enjoying my holiday tomorrow.  

Now that I have ended things with Yuu, which wasnt the easiest process.  Why is it that guys just cant be friends with thier ex-girlfriends?  Is it the idea of her having sex with another man just that horrifing for them that they choose to just have you out of their life completely?  And if that be the case, why do they have to turn fucking psycho before they adjust to the fact that getting back together is never going to happen?  Especially if you turn into stalker boy.  I think Dezzie put it best when she said, ""you cant argue your way out of being dumped!!""  

He is out of the picture.  Well, we are friends.  So now I am free to be with Rachel.  Not that I ending things with him for her (i have been single inside my head for a really long time now), but it definately makes things a lot easier for me to be with her.  Unfortunately, Yuu doesnt know about her and I would like to keep it that way for at least 2months to a year!  At least until I know that he is stable enough to know that his girlfriend left him for a chick.  Wait...a very HOT chick!  

Rachel is coming tomorrow and staying for part of Golden Week.  Friday night I am heading to Tokyo to see Adam Freeland spin!  I cant afford it, but finding good breaks in this country is just not that easy.  Then Sat Rachel and I are off to Saitama for some Dyke Weekend fest Miriam talked me into going to.  Its actually called a Dyke Weekend and Im not just being completely ignorant.  Even though I know I must admit that I am hurt that since it is called that, I cant make fun of it by calling it dykey.  I guess I just have to settle with the word ""gay"".  So two days in the woods with the girl that I cant seem to keep my hands off of.  Yeah, there will be a bunch of other people there too...but eh, what can you do.  

Monday we will head back to Tokyo to meet up with Du and Dez (maybe) and go visit host mom.  Havent seen her in awhile.  

Im pretty sure that when I return to Nagoya that I will be completely broke and forced to spent the rest of my holiday in bed.  I see nothing wrong with that."

This weekend was the biggest changing point in my life.  Bigger than my best friend moving to mississippi in 8th grade.  Bigger than coming to Japan for the first time.  Bigger than getting into and actually surviving Georgetown.  bigger than cutting chopping my hair off and then bleaching it.  But with ever major change there comes major problems.  Breaking up with Yuu has been unsuccessful.  And as i keep dragging his heart along cracking the fake I love you smiles.  There lives the person of my dreams in kyoto who I cant stop thinking about.  Truth be told...the last thing I need in my life right now is another relationship.  But this doesnt just feel different but is completely different than what i have been accustomed to.  A huge decision has to be made that will involve the sound of hearts breaking.  With the possibility of one of those hearts being mine.

I mean, I do those things too.  But a better example for me would be...if I see a movie and think that the actress or actor is cool or something like that...then I go out and find out about every movie they ever made and the proceed to rent and watch them.  This movies could be shit for all I care...I just cant get my eye off my new reason for living.  And thanks to internet, I can go and find interviews that they have done.  And spent hours reading and getting more and more infatuated. 

Fact...99% of the time its a chick.  Men just dont seem to attract this obsession with me so much.  But it has been known to happem.  But lets face it...take away the penis and what else is there?  metaphorically speaking. 

So this will go on for about a month and then die out.  During that time I will try to educate my friends on the subject.  Thanks to years of experience, I have come to know that they care and thus I keep it to myself.  But you only can keep a secret for so long.  At least I cant.  

So I am in an obsession period right now.  My time and mind are fully focused on only one thing.  

Side note to self:  Today is 13 months together.  After the horrible weekend...I still am glad we made it this far.  Haha...one thing I am not obsessed with is my relationship.  This probably says something."

True.
Teaching elementary school today was great.  It made me wonder why I even get paid to do this job.
The board of education hates me.  Something about me bleaching my hair.  Something about me quiting.  Seriously, if they dont want to be bothered with me, than why was I asked to come into.  Makes me wonder why I am being paid to be here.  

Weekend in Nagoya.  Met a new kid named Ted.  He poured out his heart as I filled in with Tequila.  He was a cool guy.  Hope to hangout with again.  It was also nice too see Ryan again.

Sunday I was completely useless.  I always said that life should just about about eating, sleeping, having sex, watching tv, back to eating, sex again, a little nap afer that, more tv...Its a continuous cycle. Thats what I did yesterday.  I think it was a record.  I managed to watch like 5 movies yesterday.  Flashdance, Knight Rider (no...im serious about that one), Yamakashi, eXtreme (i want to go snowboarding), and Showgirls (better know how save by the bell goes soft porn).  

Oh...got a visit from a little friend.  My life is no longer over.

Moments that nothing can replace...
Saw Lord of the Rings 3 with Dez on saturday for the second and talking thru the whole movie.  Walk in the with tradition hungover, movie day fast food of a mosburger cheeseburger and fries, stank up the place, talk shit the whole time, laugh while dezzie cries, and rush out of the place before we get lynced once the film is over."

"event","This past weekend was so awesome that I had to call out sick on monday.  Havent done that is a long time.  But oddly enough...I actually was sick and have continued to be sick ever since

Friday, after running around with kindergartners in the morning and 1st graders in the afternoon...but 2:30 I was driving home to start my birthday weekend.  By 7:00 I was arriving at Dezzie`s house in Nagoya.  She cooked nacos and taco salad (veggie style of course) and cracked a can of beer.  ""Otsukaresamadeshita""  
After some talking, Tom came over.  I think he is the only male (who isnt getting anything out of it) who has hung out with Dez and I and actually didnt mind doing it a second time.  Or a third.  Or a fourth.  Brave and patient kid if you ask me.  Kazuya later came over.  

Once we got rid of the boys, it was off to Sakae to hit up Karaoke.  Nice I won the Junken (or was it the other way around?), we decided to hit up Daughter'S instead for a little bit of rock!  My DJ friend Sobu was there and remembered me.  Also mentioned that he would be spinning the next night at New Breed.  Daughter is a really small club and everytime I go, there is a live performance which isnt always worth watching...but the best thing about the place is they make your drinks strong!!  Once good whiskey and coke and you are done for the night.  

We left there and I dragged Dez' sick ass to Karaoke.  Well, she really was sick so that didnt last night.  Plus...I truely cant not sing when Im drunk.  Even my warm-up song of ""BAD GIRL""  sounded like pure crap.  

Saturday afternoon we sat around her apartment and did nothing.  Accept make a wonderfull breakfast of pancakes and omelets. 

I bleached my hair.  All of it.  I dont know yet if Im going to get fired.  But it looks hot.  

Du came over.  He made a Brazilian drink called ""caipirinha"" made from Vodka, sugar, and lime that had us acting high.  After awhile I realizied that thats all it was VODKA, SUGAR, AND LIME!  No water.  No sprite.  Nothing to chase it.  Yes, it was 100% alcohol and it was GREAT!  We ordered pizza and tiermisu (my only birthday cake).  The pizza was worth the money and Dez's presents made me cry.  Lots of candy and stuff from the states, mascara!!!, a collage of our time so far in Japan, and the tear jerker...A notebook called A Hobbits Tale written in the words of Sam.  Frodee...I dont know where she got that.  But there is nothing else in this world that represents me more than that gift.  

I learned that I really hate going out to dinner and stuff life that for my bday.  I rather just have a few good friends, order a pizza, and have some beers.  I am happy with just that.  Thats what I did last year and the year before that.  They said that how you spent your bday says a lot about how you will spent the rest of your year.  I hope that is true.

So the night as just beginning.  Off to New Breed.  Loud rock and tons of tequila shots.  Sobu embarrassed me by making an announcement at midnight.  And I let the club with Du`s best friend Alan.  He is an artist and very quiet, and....(left for me only to know). (I think my birthday curse is finally over)   I will never, EVER, EVER talk shit about an 18 year boy again.  I still dream about this kid! We all headed back to the house and stayed up the rest of the night talking and drinking.  I had to be up at 6:30 to meet Yuu for snowboarding.  

So its officailly my birthday and Im in Nagano with my boy rolling down this mountain.  It was my first time out this season and damn was I rusty!  But I got i by the end.  

I made it back to Kakegawa sometime around 10:30 and feel asleep in Yuu`s arms.  It was the best birthday ever.  And a great way to end it.  So now Im 23.  Dont feel any different.  I mean...I have a cold, but I had a cold at 22, 21, 20.....so on and so on.  Maybe that means, that this year I will get right.  This year I will find that place I have been looking for.  

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME.  And THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT HELPED MAKE IT HAPPEN.

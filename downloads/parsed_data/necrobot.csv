My brother graduated from high school. I am proud of him. For a while I did not think he was going to make it. He proved me wrong.

I got a sweet job offer. It sounds too good to be true. Hopefully it all works out. 

Other than this, not many things have been going on.

Every day feels like Sunday. 



I hate Sundays."

NOTHING.

Yes, I have a girlfriend.

Everything is good with her and I.

BUT, her friends obviously don't like me.

What's funny is that I've done nothing to be disliked.

They dislike me because they think I am taking their friend away...WHEN REALLY I HAVE BEEN DITCHING MY OWN FRIENDS TO ONLY HANG OUT WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT MY GIRLFRIEND TO HANG OUT WITH ANYONE ELSE.

And you know I feel about that?

I think it's wrong.

Despite all of this stupid crap I am happy with this relationship."

I love it. (Sarcasm.)

Yeah.

Like always, I'll keep to myself about it, because I have no one to talk to about it. It definitely has to do with girl, well, one really. I'm not generally worked up like this, but now I am, she's special.

On another note, don't talk to me; don't hang out with me, because I don't care. Oh that's what they say about me, I DON'T CARE. They say, ""Zach, you don't care. You don't care about anything."" 

WELL, THANKS GUYS!

It's great to know how your friends feel about you.

Oh wait, I obviously don't care about them, so why should they care about me?



Anyway, I am very sore. I am bruised all over my body. It kind of sucks.

I need a job.

I still need to do my taxes.

I have no motivation to do anything right now.

I basically suck at everything.

I work at Target on Val Vista and Warner.

Awesome.

I start on the 9th.

I work back room so no one can really visit me.

That's ok; at least I don't have to work with stupid ass customers. 

Plus I know EVERYONE that works back room; I grew up with most of them.

I start higher than most people get paid there too, which is a plus.

Tonight was cool. 

I celebrated Eid. 

It's a Muslim holiday. 

We gave and received gifts, ate good food, smoke a little hookah, and had a good time.

I just got home a few minutes ago; I took some new photos that I will upload onto myspace.

I was coming home from school, just pulling into the driveway, and some guy comes up talking about Teen Challenge. So, here I am talking to this guy when another guy comes along. It turns out the second guy was Jared, my old best friend's older brother. I have not seen my old best friend, Josh, in over a year. Nor any of his family that I was once extremely close to. I am supposed to see some of them next Monday... This should be different, because people can change a lot over time. I already heard things about Josh that did not please me. Actually I should have known that these things would happen with Josh. Damn, I have known him for about 14 years.

Oh man, I went outside tonight, and it is bee-you-tee-full. It's nice and cool outside.

My favorite time of year is coming up and I have no one to spend it with. I want to do things for holidays. I don't want stupid drunken parties, I want culture. I want tradition.

Anyone who is up for that let me know."

I feel relaxed, lazy, tired yet sleepy, numb, cool as a cucumber, etc.

I don't feel like doing anything at all.

My plans consist of lying around doing nothing or lying around doing close to nothing.

Today I woke up at 12:30 p.m. and did nothing for two hours. I then decided it was time for a nap.

I took a nap and woke up around 5:00 p.m. and ever since I have been doing almost nothing.

This is weird for me; I don't usually sleep much at all.

I feel good though.

I am content, but more so than usual.

It's nice to not have a care in the world.

It was raining a few minutes ago, that was nice. I do like the rain.

I hate when you think you know someone and they turn out to be someone completely different than what you think, unless you dislike them then find out they are actually decent.

"event","Boy, I tell you, people are fucking dumb. I can't believe how stupid my step father is. I am trying to get back into school and all of a sudden the shit hits the fan for some reason.

Someone called me from Collins College today, he wants me to meet with him tomorrow so we can go over a few programs, so he can help figure out my many different applications, and basically help me figure out what's right for me. I told him that I would meet with him, assuming that my parents, who are paying for college, would have no problem with this. Boy, was I ever wrong? 

You see, I have a problem with getting there tomorrow; I have a flat tire on my car that needs to be fixed. So, I called my step father and I told him what was up. He told me that I can't go to the school and apply because he has to see the paper work that I had received from a previous visit. He was interested in tuition fees and all of that jazz (As anyone would be.) . I told him it doesn't matter because even if I did apply I actually have to get accepted and sign up for my courses before he gets billed. Not to mention the school has none of his billing information. 

The reason why I am pissed though is because he starts yelling at me because he knows everything. I wish he'd shut the fuck up and let me talk...for once. 

Come on, I was holding the paperwork in my hands as I spoke to him. Is that not enough?

My interview with Zia has been moved to Monday. Fun. I get to drive out there again.

I have been bored lately, extremely so.

Not much has been going on.

I have been trying to find a job, laying around, and just hanging out I guess.

Pretty lame if you ask me. 

My live journal sucks.

Want to know why?

I'll tell you.

It's because I don't have any drama.

I'm just that awesome.

While most, if not all of you have to deal with angst and regular teenagers (Disgusting) bullshit, I am just hanging out, have a grand old time.

What the hell?

This is a conversation with my friend John, that took place about 2 minutes ago, I have no idea what to think about this.

What does it mean?

It's not like I do anything to pick up girls.

I don't even try.

I'm not trying to sound like I'm hot shit.

I'm not, not at all.

I just don't get it.

My friend, my extremely good friend is getting upset with me, wow.

What do I do?

Lock myself away until I rot?"

You were probably all like, ""WHAT'S UP WITH ZACH?! GASP! Could he be dead? Who the fuck knows? He hasn't been on live journal in forever!"" 

Or not.

Even if you don't/didn't care I am going to fucking tell you anyway bitches!

Lately I have been working. WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK FUCK!

I'm in a good mood right now, that's probably why I am typing a lot of profane words.

Besides work, I have not been doing much. I had this weekend off, and I did nearly nothing.

Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, who would like to do something? I have that shit off too.

Well, in other news, fuck off.

Not really. Uhm, shit. I got up half way through that statement and forgot what I was typing.

I hate that.

Oh yeah, I bought a few new things, two cds and two new movies. 

CDs: Rotting Christ and Fields of the Nephilim.

DVDs: City Hunter and Citizen Toxie.

Hell yeah. 

I'm out of here.

Nothing has really been happening. I was talking about getting a place with my friend John in a few months. I want to see how it goes with work first. It's sad; I already want to start looking for a new job. The quota is hard for me to me.

If I do get a place, it'll be fantastic. I think my neighbors will hate us.

I also basically got a new dog yesterday, but I am trying to find him a new home. I saved him from getting put to sleep. He's pretty young, 2 maybe. I'm not sure; I'll have to find out. He's really nice too.

Huma of Rose: thanks


Well, I thought about getting back together, but I think it is over for good. For her to say she loves me and then move on so quickly confuses the hell out of me. Obviously she does not care about me. Oh well, I suck at the whole relationship thing anyway. I really do. I now know that I am mean to be alone.

On a lighter note, I finally got a job. I work at gfs. A place where I sit on a cumputer for 6 hours, 5-6 days a week, Monday through Friday , plus 2 Saturdays a month for 8 bucks an hour, and if I do good I get 10 bucks an hour. Plus I get health, dental, optical, and other benifits. Finally I will have some money in my pockets."

I gave you till last night, and no reply, I talk to you today, no answer. If the next email I get from you doesnt have an answer Im going to be forced to move on. Im giving alot of time, tomorrow by midnight I need an answer.

This message was sent to her after she told me she wanted to get back together. I told her I didn't know about getting back together and said I would need some time to think about it. I guess she is in a bit of a rush though. I wish I could explain to her that these things cannot be rushed. Sadly, I don't think she would understand that. It seems all she cares about is her, I'm on her time. I have till midnight tonight, if I don't have an answer by then, then I don't have another chance to get back together with her. How lame, I have to meet deadlines."

Huma of Rose: I'm not even trying to argue
Huma of Rose: but when the first thing a person does to me in the morning is start bitching at me...it tends to make me a little upset
Huma of Rose: especially since

Huma of Rose: well, then what the hell is all of this?
Huma of Rose: when have I ever

Huma of Rose: when have I ever bitched at you? 
her: when we were driving that one time
Huma of Rose: noooooooooo
Huma of Rose: that was not bitching
Huma of Rose: those were my beliefs
Huma of Rose: and you did not like them
Huma of Rose: because they were different than yours
her: you kept talking about them
her: when i told you to stop
Huma of Rose: so I am not supposed to say what I want
Huma of Rose: fuck that
Huma of Rose: never once have I ever
Huma of Rose: told you to not talk about your beliefs
her: no I told you to stop and you knew you were offending me
Huma of Rose: I listened to you
Huma of Rose: well, shiiiiiiiitttttttttt
Huma of Rose: it happens
Huma of Rose: you're not going to like everything that comes out of everyone's mouth
her: I know that, but you dont have to keep saying things after I tell you I dont want to hear them
Huma of Rose: I didn't ask to hear any of this from you
Huma of Rose: but what?
Huma of Rose: here I am
Huma of Rose: taking it
her: you told me to stop about the job thing and I did
Huma of Rose: yeah
Huma of Rose: well
Huma of Rose: that's none of your business though
Huma of Rose: that was my life
Huma of Rose: in the car we were talking about all kinds of medical things
her: but when it affects me then its part of mine
Huma of Rose: and cruelty to animals
Huma of Rose: so growing an ear on a rat does waht to you?
Huma of Rose: hey, if you ever lost an ear, you've got the rat
her: Im not going to fucking talk to you about that
Huma of Rose: ol' rat ears

Huma of Rose: I accept that
Huma of Rose: I am
Huma of Rose: what about you?
Huma of Rose: you need a sense of humour
her: have a nice life and good luck
her: I have one, but not when something I believe is being riticuled
Huma of Rose: everyone's beliefs are going to be made fun of
Huma of Rose: you know why?
Huma of Rose: because not everyone believes the same thing
Huma of Rose: you need to learn how to sit back, and listen to both sides
Huma of Rose: with out getting offended
Huma of Rose: I'm not even angry at you
her: i do but you were  told I dont want to hear it from you
Huma of Rose: I never really mattered to you anywa

I did go over, at five, like we had planned. She was asleep, and I tried to wake her up, but she wouldn't. So, I left her a note saying I was there and that I would talk to her later. I went home and two hours later she IMed me, that's when all of that text took place. I really don't know what the hell happened. She just went off the handle, then I of course, tried to stay calm, and failed. Then she messages me telling me that she is going to get drunk and that she is crying because she is afraid of losing me, which isn't going to happen, or wasn't...now that she's been acting this way for a while I don't know. Anyway, then she starts talking about leaving me. I was so confused, after I told her I wasn't ready to break up and after she cried about losing me, which she wasn't. I do like her, but like I said, she's off the motherfucking handle. I tried to be nice and now I don't know what I am going to do. I'm so not used to haveing a girlfriend. Did I do something wrong?"

I didn't see Megan yesterday, not at all. I didn't even talk to her. Basically what she and I already talked about is happening. She says she is scared, scared of losing me. She won't though. She is very busy, she works everyday for eight days, she goes to school at night, and that leaves her very little time to do anything else. She complains that she can only see me three days a week, she is disappointed about that. Three days is enough right? I don't know I do miss her a lot. On February 10 I am going to stay with her for a week. It's going to be fun, and I will actually get to see her. Tonight, I also might go over.

I still need a job, very badly. I really want one. I have applied to several places now, and have gotten no calls back. I also still do not have my cell phone; I need that because some of the jobs I applied have only that number to call.

"event","So, the last few nights have been interesting. I do not know what to think. I do not know what to think about many things. I do know one thing though. I am a moron. All people are morons, but right now I am probably the biggest one to have ever existed. It is great; I have wasted over 800 dollars. I thought about dropping out of school, I hate it. Next semester, when I go back, I am taking classes I want to take. Not some stupid classes that I will hate, like math and English.

I do not know what is going on with some people. People change, often times not for the best. It happens and I will have to get used to it. If I do not get used to it I am sure I will lose a lot of friends or loved ones in my life, or they will lose me. I know I am not a big loss to a lot of people.

I do not even know why I keep typing in this live journal. It really is not for anyone else to read. I keep it to vent because I took a friendly suggestion. I do not talk to other people about my problems. When I think about it, this is like indirectly talking to people about my problems. I hate that. I am thinking about ending this thing. I also do not know why I keep typing in here because most of the people on my live journal friends list do not give a damn about me. Most of them never talk to me. Not even for a second. Maybe I should not care about them either.

I realized I have lost many friends. I appreciate the fact that I will try to be their friend and they blow me off. Thank you all so much. I think you know who you are. I realize now that most of them were never really my friends at all. It is a good thing I have great friends that I have known for years and not just people I have known for short periods of time. You know the same people who could give a damn about me.

I just want to say thanks one last time. Thank you for wasting my time, my money, and most of all my life. I could have spent it better gauging my eyes out with rusty fish hooks infested with some rare incurable disease."

"event","I am pretty happy at the moment, content anyhow. I am excited for this weekend. On the 30th I get to go to Interpol and The Secret Machines show. I'm going alone, but it's cool. That means I can devote all of my attention to the show and not someone else. This weekend is also Halloween. I'm pretty excited for that, although I have no definite plans as of yet. 

Last night was fun. It was Kacey's going away party; he's off to the army. It's going to be sad to see him go, but he'll be back soon enough. The party was intense. There were giant fat drunks running around through the backyard, looking for escape routes, asking which wall they should jump over, and nearly falling into cacti. My friend Jake got drunk; it was the first time I ever witnessed that. It was hilarious. He went off on an ""I hate pumpkins"" speech. ""I HATE FUCKING PUMPKINS! THEY FEEL LIKE SHIT, AND THEY TASTE LIKE SHIT! I HATE MOTHER FUCKING PUMPKINS!"" It went on for maybe a half of an hour. 

Yesterday before the party I dyed my hair. It's darker now, and you all know my hair is already dark, which means that it is black now. I like it. I also got a new hair cut a couple of days ago. I like it. It seems alright.

I am sad, and worried. I heard that my friend Steve could be dead or in a coma. I grew up with him. I still hang out with him. I don't if it happened for sure, but no one can get a hold of him, or his family. We are still searching for him, all of us, and we are not going to give up. I hope he is ok.

I have something to announce. Despite all of the good news and the bad, I have to say I am giving up on friendships that are going now where. I'm sorry to all of you that don't care about me, or being friends with me. I invested my time, feelings, and even money on you. Then I came to realize, that it all did not matter in the end because you gave me nothing in return. Goodbye forever."

Anyway, I have been having fun the last couple of days, kicking it with my homeboys. We have to be some of the unhealthiest people ever when it comes to our diets and our morals. I must say though, it is fun."

"event","I haven't done anything exciting lately. I have been sitting here, looking for a job, going to school, and doing homework. It's no fun. I hate school. College is pointless if you don't know what you want to do. 

I did go out on Thursday though. I hung out with Samantha. It was good fun. We were both hyper; she even drank a Jolt with me. I actually had three Jolts. Anyway, I had fun, we went to a show. The bands were good, the people were good (I even talked to some), and the time spent was good. 


I watched some fantastic movies this weekend as well. I watched Bad Taste and Basket Case last night. Those movies are hilarious. The cheesy gore of Basket Case is great, same with its stop animation. Bad Taste just rules."

"event","Good God, I am dead. I went to sleep last night really early so I would not be tired, then I woke up at 9:30. I couldn't even open my eyes, so I walked around with them closed for a while. I hate school; I have my two most boring classes today, art history and communications. In art history all we do is look at slides and listen to the instructor blah blah blah bullshit all day. In communications we listen to the instructor blab and fill out worksheets. I want to kill myself. I'm thinking maybe I will drop my communications class and take a different one because it is just pissing me off.

On a lighter note, I am excited that today is my last day for the week. If I can just get through today, then I have the weekend to do whatever I want. I am excited for Friday. My buds are getting together for our usual Friday night antics. It will be fun.

I don't know about Saturday or Sunday though. I think both days are open, unless I decide to die before they happen."

"event","Weird days these have been. A lot of drama, sometimes, but if it keeps up I will start ignoring it. 

I have a lot of home work this weekend. When I say a lot, I mean enough to keep me busy for an entire day. Oh well, looks like I'll have to waste a day, I have a four day weekend anyhow. 

I started a new D&D campaign last night. I must say it is very good. It is very entertaining. Who would expect that someone like Korv could come up with such an elaborate idea? He has everything mapped out, he basically wrote a book. This thing is huge. It may be geeky, but it's something to do, and we all have fun doing it. 

Tonight is Bob's party, he's finally 18. Him being 18 means he can buy his own cigarettes. I don't hang out with him much, but I think it'd be nice to go to his party. Although I do not like a lot of the people that will be there. There will probably be some form of drama there. Thinking about it now makes me want to go even less than I already do."

"event","I do not like people much these days. So called friends are acting like douche bags. Now, not all of them are, but a lot of them. Some of them do not make time for anything these days, some are doing things I do not approve of, and some are not really being friends.

Anyway, I have myself to worry about. Though, I do worry about my friends, because I try to be a good one. All I ask is that they do the same in return.

Today was tiring...I spent all day at school. It was rough. College owns me. I have to go again tomorrow, the last day of the week, and then I have a four day weekend. Now that I have school, time seems to be going by much faster. Great, just what I need. I do not want to speed my life up; I want to slow it down. I am not ready to grow up. I just want to have some more fun before time is out. Say what ever you like, it is no fun being grown up."

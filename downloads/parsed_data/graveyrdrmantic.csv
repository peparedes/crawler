And I feel kinda bad.
Here's the skinny on everything lately:
I'm 18 now.
I have tattoos.
I got my lip pierced.
I saw Bauhaus and Alkaline Trio w/ Jolene.
I saw Depeche Mode w/ Tabi.
I'm still dating Tim.
Oh yeah, and I love XMAS!
Hooray for presents!

"event","It so totally sucks not being in school right now. My work has me at Loehmann's for at least 7 hours a day, and when I actually get off work, Tim is still at work, or it's too late to hang out. All my other friends either have jobs or school at the same time, so it's hard to get ahold of them, either. This blows.
Maybe I get to see Tabi on Thursday, though. That'd make my week better.
I think I'm taking Amber's SG pics on Thursday, too. She's so cute. She'll be a great model.
I'm pissed off right now b/c my mom just came in and yelled at me. It's too early for this shit.
I can't wait until I'm 18 so that I can just move away from this family. I love them, but I'm really sick of living with them.
Oh, and it seems my life plans have changed once again. In case you didn't read this off my MySpace, I'm no longer planning on moving to San Fran. It's just too expensive, and I really can't afford it, as much as I'd love to live there. So the new plan is Portland. It has the weather and much the same atmosphere as SF, but without the extremely high cost of living.
Laters, I'm not in a very good mood now, so I'd love to be cheered up. Thanks.

I'm now addicted to MySpace. I feel like a dumbfuck. I'm seriously on there every 5 minutes to see if someone I probably don't really care about has commented on something pointless I just wrote. I feel stupid.
The biggest thing on my mind right now is the Misfits/45 Grave/D.I. show coming up at the Galaxy. I already have tickets (they cost me 60 bucks), and it's going to be awesome. Of course, even more so if Jolene can go! I love that girl! Yay!
I'm also supposed to see Nerf Herder on the 26th, and a SuicideGirls show thingy in Silverlake the next day (when I'm also supposed to give blood). 
All is very much well right now. 
I had two job interviews yesterday, and both went extremely well. I applied at Loehmann's and the Macy's at South Coast Plaza (yuppie central). I was on the bus basically all day. But it was totally worth it. I have another interview at Macy's next Wednesday to talk to the lady who runs cosmetics! How bitchin' is that! Excitement!
Anyways, I better get back to MySpace. I'm a nerd, I know. I love you too.

"event","Today is turning out to be an alright day. I was almost afraid it was going to suck.
I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing away. I missed the call, but it was Tim, so I just called him back. This is saying that I actually got a good night's sleep though, which is totally untrue. Since my dad's remodeling my parents' bathroom, our trashcans are full of drywall, rather than kitchen trash that desperately needs to be emptied. This has led to a rise in the number of flies zooming around the house. When I came downstairs around 4, I half-way fell asleep and then a fly would land on me and wake me up (those little bastards tickle). This lasted until Tim called at 9:30. So I just stayed up.
I've done basically nothing in the way of housework (makes me happy, but pisses my mom off), and Jimi will be gone this evening. I made a deal with him that he could go out tonight because he's going surfing really early in the morning with my aunt (he's spending the night at her house). So Tim and I will be alone for a while (yay!). Anyways, that's how the day is shaping up. I should go and make lunch. Laters.

In addition to seeing the Nekromantix, I think I'm going to be at the Vault on the 27th to see TSOL."

I traded nights for tonight with Jimi, so I can sit up here and fuck around on the computer while he can't sleep b/c the dogs are barking in his ear. Sucks to be him. It's b/c he's supposed to go surfing with my aunt next week, and b/c they go so early, he'd be spending the night on a night that would normally be mine to go out on. Confused? Sorry. We switch off every night b/c our dogs sometimes make noise and one of us has to be there to take care of them. It's really been just recently that they've actually started getting obnoxious at around midnight. If any of you guys haven't played the 'Dropkick the Faint' game, I highly recommend it, especially if you're in the mood to kill some time, b/c it's rather addictive. www.dropkickthefaint.com Have fun. It's awesome.
I finally decided to go ahead and by the freakin' Nekromantix tickets. I know that there's gonna be tons of stupid fake-abilly kids, but I DO like the Nekromantix, and I'm not going to let my feelings keep Tim from seeing them, especially since they're one of his favorite bands. He said he felt bad that I'm going to pay for the tickets. He says that whenever I pay for anything. It makes me feel good, though. He has a job, so he pays for me all the time. When I get to treat him to something, I think it's well worth it. He's such a sweetie, and I love going to shows with him, so I know we'll have a good time, no matter how many lame kids are at this thing. 
I can't believe it's only July. I don't even start school for another month and a half. That sucks. I'm just going to be on here ranting about everything until then. Lame.
I think I'm gonna go back and play that game some more. Then I'll go on Suicidegirls and pick which ones are hot (a silly hobby of mine). Laters.

My parents blame everything on me and my brother. Jimi got arrested and my parents just put up around 600 bucks to get him through some state program. Now he's going to one of those Sylvan Learning Centers, and that costs around 11,000 bucks. And I'M the one who asks for 20 bucks to go to the movies and Taco Bell. Yup, I'm a real pain in the ass.
I can't wait until I'm 18. It's only 4 months and I can get tattoos, move out, become a Suicidegirl, and do basically whatever the fuck I want. I keep telling myself that it'll be better to stay at home for school b/c I can save money and not have to pay rent, but I think that when I turn 18 and my parents do something that pisses me off enough, I'm gonna live w/ Tim. I can sleep on their couch and help pay rent. I don't take up much room, and what I can't keep at their house, I'll keep here until I move to San Francisco. That's a realistic plan, right? That is, unless my parents sell all my shit if I leave. Bastards.
I'm kinda pissed off right now. If you can't tell. I'm gonna go take some quizzes and post them on here. I'm that bored.

"event","I'm home alone again like usual during the week, so I figured I'd write.
Let's see... Friday and Saturday were both spent with Tim. 
Yesterday, my mom was home and she took me and Jimi out to lunch at Polly's which was good. Then we went over to the Orange Mall (excuse me, the Village at Orange) and went shopping. At Wal-Mart I got some cool stuff: a green leopard cardigan (since I always wear my black one, and it's constantly dirty), a pink flowery tanktop (one of the ones w/ a built-in bra) and some black cordouroy pants. Then we went over to Claire's so my mom could get something for my aunt, and I got some cool earrings. As we were leaving, I stopped into Penney's and grabbed some cool undies, too. 
That is really all that's happened.
I have to turn in my app to Paul Mitchell so that I can start in September.
I also got 50 bucks from my aunt Ruthee for graduation, and another 10 from my grandma b/c she said that us kids never have any money. I'm probably gonna buy some Nekromantix tickets for me and Tim with my newfound wealth. I don't really know if I wanna do that, b/c I know that the entire show is gonna be teeming with little stupid rockabilly kids, and Tim's gonna be checking out all the pretty rockabilly girls, like usual. 
I do know that I'm definitely spending some cash on tickets to see Dead Man's Party (yes, they're an Oingo Boingo cover band) right around Halloween. I'll probably take Amber, b/c I don't want to go alone, and Tim will be busy helping his friend Bob build a haunted house in Torrance. Sounds good.
I'm in a wierd mood right now, so I think I'll talk to everyone later.

Tim still isn't allowed to drive me anywhere b/c of his little 'incident', so my mom had to drive me to his house last night. We ended up eating Taco Bell and watching the unrated Team America.
I also turned my little cousins into vegetarians this past week. I told Chelsea that if she can be a veggie for 6 months, I'll give her my 'Meat is Murder' pin I always have on everything.
I went to the O.C. Fair on Wednesday. That was ok. I'm not a big fan of carnival-type rides, though. Since I already get carsick, those things really tie my stomach in a knot. We went on one called the 'Evolution' or something equally lame. It was okay, but it kept me upside-down a little too long. I could've blown chunks. So we went on the huge ferris wheel you can see from the 55. The whole place was lit up, so it looked cool. 
I think that's about it. Tim said he'd take me to Native Foods w/ some money out of his next paycheck, so that made me happy. Later days.

"event","Wow!
Last night I saw Alkaline Trio my third (supposed-to-be fourth) time, and they were amazing. I was in the front row for the entire time and Matt even sang to me *faint*, but I'm getting ahead of myself, first things first...

Night before last, my family and Tim's family got together to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was definitely an awesome movie that I'm highly recommending to everyone... And I ended up meeting up w/ Jolene while I was at the Spectrum (unfortunately, the movie was sold out and she couldn't go in w/ us). Afterwards, she came back to my house w/ me and Tim and we hung out for a little while before going to sleep downstairs. So that was cool...

In the morning I woke up around 9:30 and decided to have a snack, so I pulled out my banana split ice cream and dug in. However, no one was awake, so I put the ice cream away and ended up going back to sleep until 11, at which point I got Jolene up, too. We got ready, Vanessa came over, and Tim picked us all up. Hooray! 

We got to the Glass House at around 1:15 and were the first people in line. It was kinda hot, but not unbearable since we were in the shade. Dan even made an appearance and Tim said 'hi' to him before I even realized who it was. After about an hour it started feeling a little hotter, so Tim and Vanessa went to the Starbucks around the corner and grabbed everyone mocha frappacinos. That made it feel about 20 degrees cooler. Around this time, other people were also starting to line up around the corner.

Anyways, after a couple more hours they started setting up the barricades outside and we were searched and let inside. I usually hate shows where they have to search everyone before they can go in, and they take practically everything... Well, the Glass House security was actually pretty cool. Not only did they not even find my digital camera, they said Vanessa could pick up her pens after the show, which no security guard has EVER done for me! So we got inside and stood around through the first two bands... Death By Stereo... Rise Against... blah...

THE TRIO CAME ON!!! I was so happy b/c my feet were hurting really bad and they made me forget all about that. Here's what I remember of what they played (not necessarily in order): Time to Waste, We've Had Enough, Maybe I'll Catch Fire (which I got a video of on my camera, but am too dumb to post), Take Lots With Alcohol, Crawl, Sadie, Warbrain, Armageddon, This Could Be Love, Radio, You've Got So Far to Go, Smoke, they even played Cooking Wine and a mix of one song I can't remember (I'm that tired right now) and Blue in the Face. I'm so sure that I forgot a least half of the other songs, but I'll look at my CDs later and probably remember. If anyone snagged a copy of a setlist, I'd love to get a look at it...

Matt sang to me at least twice. He looked me right in the eyes when he was singing 'Armageddon' and I was screaming out the words (one reason I can barely talk today). He looked at me again during 'This Could Be Love' when I was sticking out my fingers during the 'steps' part. So that pretty much made my night. The worst part of the evening was the people behind me. Not just the crowdsurfers, either. I mean crowdsurfers suck b/c I'm short and I can't see them coming (even though Tim stood behind me to protect me from them), but the biggest annoyance was from this couple standing behind me. They started out pretty far back, but as the show progressed, they started getting way too close. I kept getting elbowed VERY sharply in the ribs by the girl, and I shot her and her boyfriend dirty looks. They both claimed that it was the people behind them that were pushing them forwards, but at one point or another, they were both holding onto the barricades to pull themselves to the front. I kept telling Tim to elbow the girl in the face, but he's almost too nice a guy to do it. That was the worst, b/c I'm little and it's hard to push someone back that's bigger than you, and I was getting cranky b/c I'd been there soooo long only to have this couple (who'd probably not even been there half as long as me) try to steal my spot. Bastards.

Overall, it was a very fun day. I'm supposed to go to Knott's today w/ Chelsea (my cousin), but I'm waaaaay too tired. I posted a TON of pictures on my Photobucket, so everyone can check those out (yes, Jolene, the pic of you and Matt is there).

http://photobucket.com/albums/v83/graveyrdrmantic/San%20Francisco/

Well, overall my trip was enjoyable. I got to eat at THE Golden Era Vegetarian Restaurant, which has some of the best vegan ""meats"" I've ever tasted. The weekend could only make me happier right now, too. Tomorrow I'm going to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory w/ Tim and my family, and then on Sunday I'm going to see Alkaline Trio, Death By Stereo and Rise Against at the Glass House.

Some bad news though, Tim got caught stealing this past week. I don't think anything will come out of it b/c the store had no proof (video or anything) that he did anything wrong. Plus the cops that talked to him never read him his rights, so his confession isn't viable either. I'm still really pissed at him, though. He told me a couple months ago after he got away w/ stealing iPods that he was over stealing and he'd never do it again, and now he goes and does this... (he also told me he was going to stop smoking, and he's told me that he's smoked recently, too) It's really depressing when the one person that you love more than anything in the world lies to you. I hate thinking of him as a liar. I would seriously die for him (I don't think he realizes that) and he just blows off my feelings to be selfish and get something he wants. He HAS A JOB for chrissakes! What he stole only would've cost him 65 bucks, and he gets payed plenty to cover it! When I was on the phone w/ him the night he told me (which completely ruined two days of my vacation) he told me he did it b/c it was a rush. What a load of shit! It's not like I've never stolen before. But to me, it's something kids do and get over. You can ride a rollercoaster for a rush, and you WON'T GET IN TROUBLE!!! So now his mom is driving us to the show on Sundayand basically anywhere else we wanna go, b/c that fucker lost his car privleges, not to mention my trust...

Also bad news for Tim. He has to move. The Tustin School District is sooooo (I can't reiterate myself enough) stupid. When Tim's last house was sold out from under him he had to move into what is technically the Tustin High (where I went, the most ghetto of Tustin's high schools) area. Tim had a transfer to go to Foothill (the rich kid school in the hills) this past year, mostly b/c of their Auto Shop program that Tim would probably die w/out. So anyways, Tim's mom went to try and get Tim and his brother, Nate, transfers to Foothill. When the lady at the district looked up Tim's records, she said that his grades were too low for either he or his bro to get in to their school of choice. Isn't that FUCKED! Now Tim is going to Hillview (the continuation school) until the semester when his grades are better. At that point he'll be able to transfer into Foothill b/c he's moving again and will be in the right district. I'm kinda happy b/c his new place is right by his old one, and therefore very close to me, but I'm sad for them b/c it's more money to pay every month, and his mom is blaming the whole thing on Tim. It's kinda true, but it's still fucked up to tell your kid that the reason you have to move is b/c they screwed up. God I hate Tustin.

I've been watching that Sex Pistols documentary 'The Filth and the Fury' on the Indie Film Channel. I've seen it before, but since it's actually pretty good, I wanted to see it again. Now Jimi has control of the TV and he's watching that lame Bruce Willis 'Hostage' movie with our mom. So I'm upstairs. I have basically jack shit to talk about, but b/c I'm bored I'm just going to babble. Let's start with shows... My homeboys in the Restraints are playing at Chain Reaction on the 16th (the day before I see the Trio, and the day after I get back from Frisco and see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), so I'll probably be there, supporting my buddies (oh yeah, and since they're opening for Naked Aggression, I suggest that everyone goes). My friend Danny (that I've known since elementary school) is in an indie band called The Dane[GER]. They're good too, and Danny's such a nice guy that you should support them, too. They're playing at Chain on the 24th, and they're opening for some band called The Line, who I've never heard. All this talk about bands makes me wanna start playing. Amber and I have this sort-of-a-real-band called Buxom Breasticles (I know, totally punk rock) that we named as such b/c we both have large racks (38DD and all-natural, bitches). It's kinda funny b/c we never practice, but we talk like we're the shit... I play bass, Amber sings, Dylan (ex-Restraints bassist) plays drums, and our friend Drae plays guitar. The only practice I've showed up to (b/c so far they aren't worth showing up to), Amber and I were the only ones there, and that's only b/c we were at Amber's house.
Well, Tim just called, so I guess he's gonna come over to make hot, raunchy love to me (hopefully).

"event","Today should be fun. Tim's family's friend, Alex, is coming from Pakistan. In fact I think she's already here. She used to teach in Japan, and now I guess she's all over the Middle East. That must suck. But at least she's helping those poor little kids. 
This means that Tim and I get to stay up late at his house b/c we gotta watch his little brother. I think their mom is taking Alex out on the town...
Anyways, I'm kinda bored, so if anyone wants to say hi, that'd be nice...

I forgot how much I like that movie.
Seriously, the day I got it I watched it like 6 times.
Then I lent it to Jen for about a year and a half and got it back w/ a fat stain on it from where her sister spilled punch on it. Silly silly silly.

"event","A week from tomorrow I'll be in my favorite city in the world, San Francisco. I'm really really really excited, but I hope that my mom wants to fly there, cuz last time I got car sick uber bad when we drove. Speaking of being car sick, I guess I had a panic attack the other day (first time ever). I was in the back seat of Tim's car as he was dropping my friend Vanessa off and driving his friend Jimmy to work. Just in the time it took to get from Vanessa's house in Orange to Jimmy's work at the Tustin Marketplace, my hands were shaking and I was hyperventilating. It seemed like whenever I tried to breathe slower and more controlled, I would shake worse and my windpipe would feel like it was closing so I couldn't breathe at all. Tim pulled over to Taco Bell so I could get something to eat and calm down (since I hadn't eaten at all that day, and I was feeling like I was gonna throw up). At this point I was crying and really scared, but almost as soon as I sat down inside, my breathing problem slowed to a stop and my hands stopped shaking quite as bad. All in all it was just a wierd experience I felt like writing about since I'm bored.

I'll be 18 in December and I know what my first tats are gonna be, but I always like considering what else I could have. I already have my septum, nipples, and ears pierced (and stretched to 0g), but here's a list of stuff I'd like to get:
-stretch my ears to 1/2 inch
-get my lip pierced on the left side
-get my nose pierced on the left side, but only have a stud in it
-get a sternum piercing
-possibly get my tongue pierced?
-get my chestpiece done (bats and a spider surrounded w/ webs)
-get my 'Mom' and 'Dad' tats on the back of my calves (roses w/ banners)
-the Hindu deity Lakshmi on my upper right arm
-Edward Gorey's 'Gashlycrumb Tinies' cover on my upper left arm
-and last but not least possibly get a tattoo w/ Tim (he's gonna get a JFK tat that says 'Ride, Johnny, Ride', and I'm getting a Jackie O. pinup that says 'Run, Jackie, Run'. Cute, huh?)

I'm so psyched, as this has been the reason that I haven't written hardly at all recently. 

NEWS FLASH!!!
I've graduated high school. I'm actually done.
I'll be going to the Paul Mitchell school in Costa Mesa in the fall, so if anyone wants a really good, cheap haircut, just lemme know.

I just got back from AZ. That has to be the lamest state in the nation.
I totally hate the weather, but I guess going to Frisco in a week where it's nice 'n cold will make up for having to sit through 110 degree heat.

I also recently got a digital camera (grad present from my mom), so I'll probably start posting more pics since most of you don't have a clue what I look like...

"event","I'm again sitting in the school's library.
There are hardly any other people here, so the computers are going really fast.
The reason there are hardly any other people here: It's 6th period testing today, and since I'm a senior and don't have to test, and all my friends are either testing or not here, I'm all alone.
God, this schedule is soooo lame. 
Me and Adam were supposed to be at Denny's right now, and if I know Adam, he probably went there and didn't even bother to check in at school like we're supposed to.
Now, there's one of the school's security guards at all the gates, so even if I decided to leave and meet Adam, I wouldn't be able to. Lame.
Oh well, I should probably save my cash anyways. I can take Tim out for food after school or something.
I know I've mentioned Tim's ROP class before, but I don't think I ever explained what it is that they do. It's an Auto Technician internship. Tim's a genius with cars, and it's his favorite thing in the world. He told me last night on the phone that his obsession with cars is like my obsession with Alkaline Trio. I guess I can understand that. I don't, however, understand his obsession with putting stupid shit all over his car. At one point (and I guess still) he wanted to put a huge foam fin on the top of his car, and now he wants to shave the handles off the doors, and put on Lambo doors. Let me also remind you that Tim's car is a 1989 Ford Probe. It looks like something out of Back to the Future (they're actually the cop cars in the aforementioned movie). Sigh.
I'm really excited about going to see the Trio. I know that it's not until July, but I'm already ready to hop in the car and drive off. I even had a dream about it the other night...
Anyways, I'm gonna go b/c I'm starting to get tired of all this typing. I'll probably write again, though, b/c the testing schedule and my lack of Denny's has left me with 3 hours of free time. Later days.

Rocky Horror was great. Dylan and Andy dressed like girls again and Tim took pictures on his fancy new video phone. Amber, Sherry and I went in our undies, and had a generally cold time until we got inside. The show was great, as usual, and since Tim was dressed like Brad, he had to take his pants off... Heehee!
Until a couple weeks ago, my mom was the only one who knew that Tim and I have been having... umm, 'physical relations'. Apparently, Tim left a condom in his pocket after Rocky Horror (we weren't using it for it's intended purpose, just blowing it up) and his mom found it when she was doing laundry(oh, the irony) I love Tim's mom, and I was really scared that she was gonna think I'm slutty or gross or something, but she seems to be pretty cool with everything. 
I'm jealous of Tim right now, b/c he has an iPod. I'm uber poor and can therefore not afford one. :(

Of course, she automatically assumes that it's my hair dye, even though I haven't dyed my hair in over a month. So, after I tell her that I seriously don't know what the stuff is, she just keeps bitching. Anyways, she's still mad at me, so I went to Tim's house at around 12:30 today.

I'm so very excited. But not about getting my grades.
I think I'm probably failing at least 2 classes, and that's not gonna give me a very happy mom who will be willing to let me do things this summer (AKA Warped Tour and the Damned). I have been trying to raise my grades, though, and that's all that should matter (isn't that what they always said, 'if you're trying, that's all that matters') I think someone said that. Probably my mom.
I finally got the new A.P. on Sunday. 
Tim and I went down to Tower and got that and the new AMP with NOFX on the cover.
This grrl that Kris works w/ was there and she recognized me.
She was soooo hyper! We talked for a minute and this is how some of it went:
Her - All I've had to eat today is sugar and cigarettes! (manic laughter)
Us - You didn't eat the cigarettes, did you? (confused looks)
Her - I don't think so... (now she looks confused)
I can never remember this grrls name, but she's almost always in there, and she's really nice.
Also, I got to turn in my application at the theater on Sunday. 
Me and my mom went all over the place.
First, we went to Target to return a shirt she bought.
Then we went to the Cingular store and she got me my own cell phone.
Then we went to the theater to drop off my application.
Then we drove out to Newport Beach to go to Grant Boys to get me some new jeans w/o gaping holes in them.
Then we ended up having lunch at Mimi's near Triangle Square.
Goodtimes.

That is THE coolest thing that's happened recently! Oh yeah! *dances*

Plus, next week is the last 3 days of school. 
I'm scared to death b/c I don't think I'm going to pass some of my classes. This is about how I think it's going down:
U.S. History - I'm already signed up for Summer School
English - I'm pretty sure I'm failing
T.A. - I'd better pass or someone will die a horrible death
Chemistry - Really confident I'll pass
Stagecraft - Again, I'd better pass...
French - The only other class I'm worried about, but I can raise my grade

My mom was telling me this morning that I might be able to bring a friend when we go to Palm Springs. Since Tabi will be back by then I'm probably going to see if she can go. If not I'll probably ask Kris or Tim (even though I highly doubt that my mom will want us spending the night together).

Yesterday in Stagecraft was some really good times. We're playing this game called 'Jellybeans' where everyone in the class sits in a big circle onstage and someone gets up and goes to someone who means a lot to them and gives them different colored jellybeans for these different things they're supposed to represent. So, being the cute little friend that she is, Cassy went up and did me, Vanessa and Dulce all at once. This is about what I remember...
We got an orange jellybean for the vending machine.
A white jellybean for the necklace at Icing we got a 'discount' on.
A purple jellybean for the guy with the blue gloves at Baskin-Robbins.
And a yellow jellybean for Calvary Chapel.
I thought it was sooo cool b/c no one but us knew what the hell she was talking about. Hehehe. If they only knew...

Anyways, I'm being forcibly taken to an Angels game tonight.
I'm not really very excited at all.
Baseball's fun and all, but it's more fun when Tim's there and I don't really have to watch the game.

I'm gonna go buy the new A.P. tomorrow. 
And while I'm at the Market Place I'm going to apply for a job at the movies on the Tustin side (there's a bigger, better theater on the Irvine side). My buddy, Rebekah, works there and she said she'd give me her recommendation. 

I'm getting kinda tired, so I'm probably gonna stop right about here.

"event","I had a really good day yesterday until I got home from Tim's. 
Here's the good part of my day:
I went to school and saw Tabi first thing in the morning. We walked over to the library so I could return my books. She lent me her yearbook so I could sign it, b/c she knew I'd write a lot. I spent my entire 1st period class writing (I wrote about a page and a half). I went through all my classes w/o a problem. I picked up a huge (9 feet x 4 feet) canvas poster from one of my school's plays that Tim wanted (I figured I'd give him a little surprise present when I saw him). So I take the bus and get all the way home w/ no problems but that my arm was getting kinda sore (that poster was really heavy). I see Tim smile when I give him the poster (b/c he knew almost instantly what it was). We hang out at my house for a while. I go over to Tim's house to work on my Power Point project for chemistry. We go out for pizza. We get back, I work on the project until my dad calls around 8, and I go home. 
Now for the bad part of my evening:
Well, after getting home, I explained to my mom that I'd already eaten, and that I was just going to go upstairs and go to bed (this might be a little bit confusing to some people. My brother and I switch between sleeping upstairs and downstairs every night so that there's always someone down there to take care of the dogs). I go upstairs and take a shower. Meanwhile, I can hear my dog going crazy in his crate b/c he hasn't been walked all day, so he's not tired. However, it seems difficult for the rest of my family to fathom that something outside of my power might be wrong, so as soon as I'm out of the shower, getting comfortable in bed and talking to Tim on the phone, my dad tells me that I need to go downstairs and take care of my dog. Excuse me, but when it's my turn to sleep downstairs, I take care of Jimi's dog whether it's 9 o'clock or 2 AM. So, rather than interrupting my sleep cycle too much, I go out to the stairs and tell Jimi that it might make things easier if he gave the dog a treat or just something to chew on, b/c sometimes that helps. Apparently, however, that's not what the dog wanted last night. So, my dad is still bitching about how it's my responsibility and all this crap, but rather than letting me go downstairs to fix the problem, he brings my dog upstairs so that he can just bark in my room. I'm getting kinda pissed off, so I open the door so that maybe he realizes that he's not solving anything. Instead, he just comes back to my room and tells me to get off the phone w/ Tim and to not call him back. Fuck that. So, I'm all pissed off and crying and shit b/c my dad keeps telling me what a terrible person I am, and how I'm never doing anything for anyone but myself. It sucked. My mom came in to talk to me and I think she was actually agreeing w/ dad, which was awful, b/c it's my mom who's always telling me to stick up for myself. How the hell am I supposed to do that when she doesn't?!? Anyways, it wasn't good times. My mom actually ended up spending part of the night in Jimi's room. A little later my dad came in b/c he wanted to sort things out I guess. He doesn't do a very good job of it. So we basically argued until about 10:30, when I told him to just leave my room so I could go to sleep. So I called Tim. We only talked for about 5 minutes, but I just wanted to let him know basically what had gone, considering that I'd had to practically hang up on him. 
But anyways, that was my night last night. It sucked and I hope today is better. I'm at home b/c I'm on my rag and I have killer cramps, which isn't making me feel any better. So, I'm kinda tired of typing. Later days.

Check your email whenever you think of it. Listen for the phone, but don't screen those incoming calls. You have a rendezvous with destiny, and that invitation to high adventure could be coming from any direction, transmitted through any medium. Best of all, this isn't a disembodied cosmic summons that you have to interpret, but a personal contact from someone that you know. Your spiritual and emotional well-being depends on others. They'd never let you down in a million years. Trust and appreciation make everything easier. Do you know how lucky you are to have such good friends?

That really does sound like me. It's kinda scary actually."

We just finished up most of our U.S. History project, and I think we're using Reel Big Fish or Green Day as the music. They want to use Good Charlotte, but I don't really want to. The 'o' button on this keyboard keeps sticking, and it sucks. I'm sending it spiteful looks. 
I meant to write the other day about all these dumb LJ kids who got pissed off at me for posting the A.P. cover in a couple Trio-related communities. They were being bitches, so I don't think I'm going to write on those communities for a while. Dumb kids. 
Yeah, Tim and I went to the chili cook-off in downtown this morning after I got back from breakfast w/ my grandma. Can you say 'redneck central'? I was going to ask the 'sign up to be Republican' people where the Green party had their booth, but I know they would've just given me shit. Oh well. Demockracy.
I'm tired of typing, so I'm going to go.

"event","Hey everyone.
I had to go to the doctor this morning around 10:30. We got there about 10:20 and it was almost noon before we got in. It was incredibley stupid. They claimed that it was some problem w/ the insurance, but I know that they just don't like me. This was also the first time I'd seen my new doctor since our old one fell off the face of the earth. She seems like a nice enough lady. She kinda has a Southern-esque accent, which makes her seem somehow nicer. That doesn't really make sense, but oh well. Anyways, I was there so she could look at my toe. For those of you that don't know, I got a really wicked infection from an ingrown toenail not too long ago. She gave me a prescription that my mom is picking up after work, and told me that I should soak my foot in epsom salts. That sounds good, b/c it'll make my feet all soft and smooth. She also told me that it'd probably be a good idea that I start wearing sandals, which I'm not a fan of, but my dad bought me some anyways. This is really metro. I hate sandals. Especially these. They're black and purple and comfy and everything, but I still hate them...
I just found out about 5 minutes ago that Mr. Matt Skiba will be on the cover of the new A.P. for this month. I will surely be picking this up soon. Also on the cover is Mr. Fat Mike and Mr. Jello Biafra (which is why I'll probably make Tim buy one, too). 
Really, the entire point my writing this was to say that doctors suck.
And that I've made the decision to never smoke another cigarette again. It's a tough decision, b/c I like to smoke sometimes, but it bothers Tim, and even though he hasn't come out and told me to stop yet, I'll just do it anyways to make him happy. It's not really that big of a deal anyways, since it's not even an everyday thing for me. 
I should probably go now, seeing as how I really need to work on my Chemistry project which is due next week. Later days.

I've had a alright day. 
My mom was bitching at me this morning, so I refused to give her a hug on her way out, so she said, ""You'd better hope I don't get in a car accident on the way to work."" ... 
What
the
fuck
is
that
?!?
Maybe she's just on her rag or something, but you should never say shit like that, especially when you started the whole fucking conversation. I just sat there, being quiet.
Other than that, my day was fine. I left school after being there for five minutes w/ Tabina. We went over to Del Taco so that she could fix her eyeliner, and we met up w/ Cassy. Tabi trid explaining the whole 'her and Kris' situation to me, and as much as I hate to say it, it sounds like another case where Kris just wants to be pitied. It's because she's emo.
Speaking of emo and another thing I hate to admit, but I'm actually listening to the Smiths right now and enjoying it... (smirks)
But yes, back to my day...
Well, we took the bus to the Market Place and went to IHOP for breakfast. After waiting for forever to be seated, we just left w/o paying after eating a bunch of food. Hehehe. I swear I'm terrible.
We then went over to Target and looked at cool dishes and stuff. It was fun! Hooray for Mexican-design plates and margarita glasses!
Oh yeah, and if it's available to you, you should all pick up the new issue of O.C. Weekly, b/c the ever-so-good-looking tattooed man, Jesse James is on the cover. Oh yeah!
Well, I'm kinda tired, so I'm gonna go bask in my emo-ness. Later days.
I need a cigarette...

P.S. Also, tomorrow night, D.I. and Broken Bottles will be playing in San Clemente tomorrow night. I really hope I can go! Tim loves D.I. and he'll freak when I tell him!"

I'm in the process of changing around the layout on my journal still, but I guess it's coming along fine. I'm trying to put a picture in the background, but I'm such a retard that I did't figure it out until just now.
Jimi stayed home from school today, that bastard. I'm just glad that I didn't have to stay for lunch. I hate staying for lunch, b/c half of my friends get to leave, and it makes me hate 6th period even though I have no reason to hate it. Actually, it's one of my cooler classes, b/c Mrs. Ferguson is so sweet to me! Yay for nice teachers. I sit next to some fairly annoying people, though. There's this girl, Diana, who just won't shut up, this boy who wears his hair in a ponytail (which I hate in the first place b/c it reminds me of my dad), and this other little girl who's really quiet, so she doesn't really bother me. Other than them, I sit near my buddies Brittany and Ivan, so that's pretty cool. Stupid Diana makes me pass around this dumb notebook that she and this other girl, Yanelli, have filled w/ their personal, trivial little notes. This notebook, when it's not being lobbed at my face, is being constantly written in. I can't believe that Diana has actually learned some amount of French! Anyways, I'm ranting about something that's really pointless... So, onto something more pleasant...
Well, next week should be fairly eventful if I can get some money. I have my Drama Banquet at the Tustin Ranch Golf Course, which should be okay, but I'm still not totally decided on whether I'm going or not. I asked Tim, and he doesn't sound excited, so I dunno if I'll go.
Today was class elections at my school. Melody (my buddy from Drama) was running for class President for next year against this guy I know named Jesse, and this other girl I know named Liz. I really wanted Mel to win, b/c she's really a sweetie, and she'd do such a great job, but unfortunately Liz won. She's nice and all, but I still feel bad for Mel.
I guess Tim will be here in about an hour and a half. I must admit that I feel really bad about how much time I spend w/ him. As much as I love him, I feel that I'm neglecting my friends (AKA Tabi, Ninna, Cassy, etc.) and I love them, too. Tabi even started thinking that I didn't wanna move out w/ her anymore! I couldn't believe it when she told me that, b/c my personal plans had never changed. Much of my past couple years of life has revolved around her and Kris, and how we've been planning on living together in San Francisco when we're all out of school, and that plan (for me, at least) hasn't changed. I still want to go to art school in SF, I still want to live w/ my best friends (and Tim), and now that it's finally almost time for me to start thinking about these things, I'm put in an awkward position. I mean, I love my friends, I love Tim, and I'm really excited about being able to finally be on my own. And to only increase the difficulty of my situation, I guess that Kris and Tabi are having a serious fight right now. I told Tabi that it'd probably blow over in a week, but she insists that it's more serious than usual this time. She just told me this morning that she and Kris ended up screaming at eachother! Really, if you know the two of them, you'd see what best friends they are, and how much they're really meant for eachother. Stupid shit happens sometimes, and they'll get mad and get over it. I hope that that happens this time...
Since I don't want to leave everyone on such a sour note, I want to let everyone know that today is my dad's birthday! Yay! Feliz cumpleanos! Bonne anniversaire! Yay!
I think I should also post a picture, since pictures are fun and I have a shitload of them on my parent's computer...

That is the ever-so-good-looking Mr. Ryan Adams. Not only is his music great, he's not so bad himself... 

I'm getting kinda tired, and I might like a little nappy-bye time before Tim gets here, so catch all of ya'll laters.

One last thing... if anyone knows where I could find a copy of the screenplay for 'The Breakfast Club', it'd be mucho appreciated, b/c my drama class for next year wants to do it. Yay for 80's movies!

Tina's on Google, looking for pictures of the war in Iraq. It's insanely boring in here. Cassy's an aide this period, but she can't really hang out, b/c she's doing aide-esque stuff. 

So, this is about what I've done since last Friday...

Well, Friday night Tim and I ended up going to the play again. My mom drove through Del Taco again on the way there,and I'm feeling really guilty about this, but I ate chicken!!! I can't believe I did that! After being a vegi for so long! Ahh! It didn't even taste that good... 
This was the second night and the theatre was still almost sold out. It was really cool to see all these people there for drama. After the play, we went to Denny's again and this time we actually got to drink our shake (strawberry...yum!). My mom picked us up around 9:45 and we went back to my house and just chilled for the rest of the night until his mom picked him up around midnight like usual. Oh yeah, and right before he left, my cousin came over to spend the night w/ Jimi.

Then on Saturday, I got all of my housework done and my room almost all the way cleaned, so we went to Ruby's with my aunt and grandma, which was fun. I had these really awesome veggie tacos (no more meat for me), which I ended up spilling on the floor on Sunday... After lunch we went to Albertson's really quick, dropped the groceries and the kids off at home, picked up Tim, and I went to get my hair cut. I brought in a picture of Heather Hannoura for I wanted it cut, but I don't think it really looks like her... Later that day, Tim's mom picked Tim and I up from my house and we went to Benjie's for dinner. After that we went to Blockbuster, rented Gandhi and Tim and I were dropped off at his house so that we could start the movie while his mom picked up some of their groceries. The movie was good, but it was also fairly boring... (yawn)... So we finished most of the movie, but Tim's mom took me home earlier than usual, b/c we were going to get up early and go to the paintball park Sunday morning...

So I wake up around 5:30 Sunday morning. I take a shower, get dressed and eat an apple. Tim and his mom picked me up around 6:45, and we were off to Corona. I was really excited, b/c paintball is something that's important to Tim, so I wanted to experience it. Now, don't get the idea that I was going out there to try and play, I was only there to watch. It was a long day, but I was very proud of Tim, and it was cool to get to see him do something he likes.

That was my weekend in a nutshell. It was actually a really great weekend... Hmm, I hadn't thought about that until now.

Well, I've got to get to work on this project, as the period is over in like 22 minutes. Later days.

<3 Sunny

P.S. If you're driving by Tustin and 17th in Santa Ana and you see the big sign to buy strawberries, please take a moment to laugh at the dumbness of this sign, as it advertises the best berries on Earth, yet their free taste test only gives 'one berry per family'. It's the funniest thing I've seen in a while..."

"event","Last night was very, shall we say... interesting. There were many a thing that I must tell everyone about. It all starts off about 10-20 minutes after I finished writing my last entry. Vanessa and I went out by the THS attendance office and waited for Tim to arrive. Once he got there, Tim and I met up w/ my friends, Jessica (aka Icka-May), Chris (the gay one), Geneva and Tina. I really didn't want Tina to come all that much, b/c she went out w/ Tim a year or two ago, and she still has hardcore feelings for him even though she's going out w/ my buddy Ivan. So, our little crew walked over to Jack in the Crack right down the street from the school and Icka-May bought me some fries (I only asked for a small, but she got me a large). Geneva and I talked about my nose ring, which got everyone talking about the subject of piercings. I've decided that it'd be really cool to have my nipples pierced. That was way random. So yeah, we started walking back to the school and Jessica decides that it'd be fun to flash cars passing by us on El Camino. However, she doesn't want to do it unless someone will do it w/ her. So, being the outgoing, large-breasted grrl that I am, I flashed a car or 2 w/ Jessica. Good times. Then, Jessica asked if she could kiss me on the lips. I said 'yeah', b/c I'd never been kissed by a girl before, and I thought it might be fun (besides, Tim has said that chicks kissing is hot before). I'm comfortable enough w/ my sexuality that I can kiss another grrl and not have it bug me. And Jessica has soft lips. When I announced this to everyone, Jessica came up to me, and we full-on Frenched. It was pretty hot, and I'm pretty sure some of the people driving by were staring. So yeah, that was interesting. I think it's cool that I have friends like Icka-May. She's the shite.

So, we got back to the school and watched the play. It was absolutely amazing! I was so proud of all my little drama friends (esp. Justin and Melody, who played the lead roles and were fantastique!). Tim thinks Justin is funny b/c he can think up the funniest shit just off the top of his head. Like at the play last week, Justin was sitting behind us, and Tim mentioned something about our friend Pierre. Justin, being as quick-witted as he is, said : ""Pierre, that's what happens when your bladder's empty!"" He's just funny like that. Back to last night, though. Justin played the prince in Ever After. He got to yell and there were a couple of lines of innuendo (played mostly by Ivan) which were highly great. So Tim and I had an awesome time. 

After the play, Jessica invited Tim and I to go to Denny's w/ the rest of the drama gang. Tim called his mom to make sure it was cool, and of course she said 'yes'. His mom's a real sweetie! But before we left, I got to ride around on this BMX bike that Vanessa was screwing around on. Of course, I fell on my ass (and it's still sore), but it was well worth it. So, we walked to Denny's. Jessica ordered a chocolate-banana shake (which we didn't have enough $$$ to pay for) and we all shot Nowlan nasty looks. Okay, I should tell everyone the story of why we hate Nowlan. It all starts back toward the beginning of the school year (sometime in October)... So, all is well in drama, until one day when Melissa (my good friend whose been hardcore drama since birth) accidentally hit Nowlan w/ her moccasin. She went over to apologize to him, and he socked her square in the face! Mrs. Roseman, after hearing about this, gave MELISSA a chance to apologize, not NOWLAN (who was ready to hit her again) and when Melissa refused, Roseman kicked her out of drama. It's most likely the most screwed up thing I've ever heard. So anyways, we were shooting Nowlan dirty looks, and now you all know why. The shitty part about being at Denny's was that Tim's mom arrived before we got our shake, but really, I was pretty tired anyways, and it was already half-past 9 at least. So I went home and had a peaceful night's rest. Actually, it was really wierd, b/c Dylan (this punk guy at my school) was in my dream! It was really awkward, b/c I was friends w/ Amber, too (Steven's stupid gf who went from preppy to punk in a period of 3 weeks). Wierd.

Well, I feel that I've typed enough, so I'll see ya'll laters.

<3 Sunny

P.S. Oh yeah, and I have to come to the play tonight, too, so if anything else interesting happens, I'll talk about it tomorrow... Later days...
P.S.S. And I forgot to mention that when we were sitting at Denny's, Tina was at our table. She started talking to Ivan about how she and Tim went out, and she called him ""my Tim"". I was going to start laughing, b/c now Tim hates her guts. He said that kissing Tina was like a terrible mistake. I just found it amusing that Tina still likes him. Hehehe. Tim loves me. Yay!"

I'll write more later, but I'm finding that as soon as I'm in Ottawa, I feel like my Brum life is outside of me.  That isn't phrased well, but it's almost like it existed in a dream or happened to somebody else.  Probably because home never changes, really, so it's like I never left.  (Mum's thinking about selling this house.  I am traumatised by the very idea.)

After about 780 drafts, my proposal is workable.  Jeezo.  My first attempt at a proposal (the one I submitted with my application almost two years ago) took a weekend.  My actually proposal took about two months.  Fucking fuck. 

So, now I have approval to start writing an actual formal introduction.  And a more detailed chapter breakdown.  And I have to be done writing everything by January 15, the completely arbitrary date I decided on as a deadline.  (Sadly, I chose this in part because it means a flight back to the UK will be cheaper.)

I met <a href=""http://www.jo-ham.com"">Joe</a> last Thursday, after much delay.  He is a seriously nice and very funny guy, which I knew already, but in-person confirmation's a grand thing.  We had lunch at what was possibly the most complicated pub ever.  ""If you're both eating, we have a special deal on where one of you will get your meal half-price.  Oh, if you're both having fish & chips, you should get the SUPERCRAZYDEALOFTHECENTURY.  Utensils and sauces are over there (waves vaguely away from himself in a non-specific direction).  Which table?  No, don't point, give me a number.  I said don't point!!""  Gaaaaah.

But yes, Nottingham is nice, despite that mad barmen.  Was too broke to do the essential tourist shit, but it was just nice to be in a city centre that doesn't smell vaguely of vomit.  And, maybe for the first time, I didn't have to think about which was the passenger side of a British car.

So, the top I intended to wear to the wedding got nail polish on it during the flight.  Hoofuckingray.  So I ended up wearing BRIGHT RED (with a black skirt with flowers and Chinese slippers).  EXTREEEEME.  Those who have met Jo know her style is, uhm, unique.  She stole a turquoise flowered skirt from Rachel and worse stripey socks and green gardening clogs.  No really.  It was very Jo.  Rachel outclassed us all.  It's so weird to think that she ended up the girliest out of all of us.

---

The wedding itself was at an <a href=""http://www.theplayersnyc.org/"">old boys theatre club</a> on Gramercy Park and was absolutely fabulous.  Very stiff drinks too.  Mmm.  

The service was amazing.  The bridesmaids carried 'bouquets' of willow twigs with paper cranes afixed to the ends).  The wedding bit was conducted by a Humanist chaplain with a couple of Catholic touches. (Presumably for the benefit of the groom's family, or just because lighting a unity candle is a nice thing.  Oh, and the Book of Matthew has some good shit, yo.)  Ruth was wearing this amazing beaded dress and both the bride and groom were giggly throughout.  Perfect.  And short!  Only 15 minutes!  That's my kind of wedding.

---

I must admit that I was drunk before dinner, but I got over it.  I figured at least one person had to be able to get us back to the hotel later.

---

The groom's brother's speech was amazing.  God, everyone was so funny and nice, it was just a totally beautiful occasion.  Except when an uncle tried to flirt with three of us at once and his nephew called him on it.  Heh.

My family is bitchy, so I'm eloping, I swear.

---

At 11, we were kicked out of The Players and we went to the bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel for a post-wedding shindig.  The bride and groom, who had been 'separated' (if y'know what I'm sayin') for three weeks never showed up.  Hee.  The bar was surprisingly, er, meat markety for an upscale hotel, so we headed back to the hotel.  Rachel was still drunk.  We all slept well.

---

I walked Jo to her bus to Laguardia at 7:30am.  Fucking jetlag.  I checked in with the <a href=""http://www.3waction.com"">people who live in my computer</a> to see if we were still meeting up later.  Rachel (when she woke up and had some hangover recovery time) and I, like good tourists, went to the Museum of Natural History (I'd never been) and then out for a fancier-than-intended brunch at the sorta French place.  Then she had to go.  I probably won't see her until New Year's, unless I find some money and the inclination to go to Dallas.

---

I walked around a bit, tried to nap, and then met some of the aforementioned computer dwellers.  Mitzi, Amelia, kta, Glinda, and the Divine Ms Astruc had a fabulous time talking Blackout 2003, moving to New York, leaving New York, and geneology, among other things.  It was SO great to finally meet them all.  I wasn't at all scared.  Hee.

By Monday morning, I hadn't heard from my friend Brian yet.  After walking to <a href=""http://www.handhbagel.com/"">H&H</a> (SO GOOD) and then through Riverside Park, I decided to check out.  As I was leaving my room, Brian phoned.  He didn't have a lunch break until 1, so I wandered around midtown for a while, pondering whether I should buy another bit of luggage to aid my journey home, then had ice cream in Bryant Park while I waited for 1 to roll around.

Now, I've known Brian for five years now.  We met in Scotland and he's always been sort of quiet and a little shy.  Not so much now.  He has a wonderful girlfriend and he's just...transformed somehow.  So smiley.  So chatty.  So happy.  It's fantastic.  It couldn't have happened to a better person.  They're on vacation in Iceland right now!   And they're shacking up!  Phew.

---

I went to pick up my luggage, then had my first adventure on the Long Island Railway.  Well, not so much an adventure as a very boring, very short trip to JFK.  JFK is exceedingly boring and I resent being told to check in 3.5 hours early when I spend 2.5 sitting around trying not to die of boredom.  They didn't even make me take off my shoes.  I guess it's hard to hide bombs in Birkenstocks.

---

The flight back was not as cool.  No video-on-demand.  More like video-as-we-want-to-show-it.  I slept about 1.5 hours.  I love my student visa, since it makes passport control easy, even when you're a zombie.  I got lost trying to find Euston (again) and once I found it, the schedules said my train was cancelled.  Fuckadoodledoo.  I finally  got into my flat at noon and then slept for 15 of the next 24 hours.

"event","It's bad enough going to New York City...no wait, it's great to go there, but it's hard enough to feel like you belong there.  After a SWEET flight on Virgin Atlantic watching too many Scrubs and Little Britain reruns (and Shaun of the Dead! WOO!), I ended up spending more than a hour in line at US Immigration.  I actually saw someone get taken away in handcuffs.  It was scary.

And then I got lost in the subway.

Not seriously lost, mind you, but when you have luggage on your person and are lost, you kind of stick out a little.  I was finally back in a place with a similar accent to my own and I made a rookie mistake, a mistake I was aware that people made, and ended up thirty blocks North of where I had to be.  By the time I got to the hotel, I was too tired to do anything, so I watched a Scrubs marathon (it was a very Zach Braff weekend) and ate too much stuff from the deli on the corner.  I fell asleep at 10ish, but got woken up repeatedly by Rachel and the front desk staff.  She got in at 1:30, in a cab from Newark ($65!!!).  I've never slept so badly.  And I still woke up at 7:30. Fuck.

Friday was fun.  We wandered around a bit, with Urban Outfitters on the brain, and then it started to rain.  A lot.  Torrentially.  I stepped in a puddle up to my knee on the way to the fancy-pants lunch.  I bought an umbrella from a guy in the subway.  It turns out it was the last one, so we had to share.

<a href=""http://www.barbettarestaurant.com/"">Lunch was lovely.</a>  We got to talk to the <a href=""http://www.playscripts.com/author.php3?authorid=4"">bride</a> for the first time in two years and her mother for the first time in 14.  And ate.  A lot.  And the restaurant was not quite as scary posh as I thought and the upstairs, where we were eating because of the rain, was not a rococco nightmare like the photos suggest.  One of the salad options included prusciutto with a 'fantasy of melons', though, the source of much amusement.  Luckily, Ruth ordered it.  A piece of canteloupe was carved into a horn.  Oy vey.  Hee.

During this time, we found out that Jo's flight was cancelled.  She was due to be arriving at 3, so she would be missing the boat cruise/dinner event planned by the <a href=""http://www.dccomics.com/features/vertigox/vaughan.html"">groom</a>'s parents.

--

We nearly missed it ourselves, underestimating the subway times.  As we approached the dock, we saw several yachts, including one with a frickin' HELICOPTER on it.  I turned to Rachel and said ""Imagine going on that thing?""  Well, that was our boat.  It was also the first of many weekend utterances of ""Whose life is this?!""

I mean, despite the rain, and despite my tray of food collapsing before I even took a bite, it was amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  It did the loop of Manhattan, then went to the Statue of Liberty, which I've only ever seen from the air.  I only hope that my photos turn out.  It was a perfect idea, too, since about half of the guests had never been to New York before.  This was my fourth visit and I was still in awe.

I skipped the post-dinner visit with Ruth because the jetlag was really getting to me, but by the time that I actually got to the hotel, I was overtired and getting that rapid heartbeat thing that keeps you from sleeping.  When Jo showed up, I couldn't stop babbling (a bad habit when I'm lacking sleep), so I was still up when Rachel came back.  Ack.  

--

Next morning, we went to Tom's Restaurant (aka ""That Seinfeld Place"") for breakfast, then made the mistake of trying to shop in Chinatown on a Saturday.  Well, it's hard to move in Chinatown on a Saturday.  We ended up in this three floor superstore for a bit, but gave up after I found some slippers.  Jo had never been to New York (so it really was a pity that she missed the cruise), so we went to Times Square (yuck) and beyond to Central Park.  I feel badly because she didn't see that much.

"event","Back in the day, around the end of high school, I pondered journalism as a career, despite already being skeptical about the news media in general.  Nonetheless, I applied to an elite Journalism school and was disappointed when I didn't get in.

Now I'm glad I didn't.  I'm too big a snob. 

Seriously, I never realised how much studying history had affected me.  I'm still holding on to that outdated ideal that historians are trying to contribute to a canon of 'truth' that probably never existed.  Journalism ain't that.  

Not that books should be the only resource, but journalists are, from what I can tell, relatively lazy.  'Research' consists largely of asking people questions about what knowledge they might have, rather than drawing on books, articles, statistics, etc.  Finding stories for current affairs often involves reading newspapers and websites for stuff to probe into more deeply.  History is about asking questions too, but you go to all sorts of resources to get your information.  You analyse it to come to new conclusions.  You can be smart about it without alienating a chunk of your (probably tiny) audience.

I think news makes an interesting source for historical research, but the content and form are so different that I'm totally frustrated by the so-called historical current affairs stories coming out of this show.  They are invariably slightly corny slice-of-life stories or sentimental tales about fallen soldiers in a long-ago battle.  (Occasionally, these two things are combined.)

Furthermore, I don't know how I'm going to survive in any work or academic environment where you're not guaranteed results.  'Yah, well, you know that REALLY INTERESTING story we've been working on for two months?  Yah, well, it's been put on hold indefinitely. HA!'

There's also the question of pleasing everyone.  Did you know that because of Hutton Inquiry, the CBC has to be even more careful about what it says?  Or that, despite their 'best' efforts, the show I work on still gets complaints every single day from people who feel that we are the mouthpiece of the Liberal Party and that we're ignoring the West/Natives/Maritimers/Conservatives/etc?  It's excrutiating that the idea of 'national' news in this country, on Canada's public broadcaster, means showing yet another parliamentary fuckwit holding yet another press conference in the centre block and footage of a blizzard somewhere in the hinterland.  (By 'hinterland', I mean 'somewhere outside Toronto.')  

Thing is, I have no real right to a) question their methods or b) pretend to be a proper historian.  I do feel very privileged to work here at the CBC and I still do respect the organisation.  I'm just glad I get to leave soon.  And that I get to use my perplexed attitude to my advantage for my term assignment.  Mwahaha."

"event","Not that it matters so much, really, in the end, but I've decided that I really need to write.  I need to express myself somehow and, well, I'm not a dancer, I don't have a strong enough liver to sing in public, and I can't draw beyond Exploding Dog-style cartoons (and I lack the imagination to do them.)

So, here I am, having another go at the online journal thing.

My mother has cancer.  It's back.  Just a few stray cells, like last time, but it means more chemo and more fear.  Her body expresses its dismay by filling cavity with fluid.  The last couple of times, it was her pericardium and her lungs.  This time, it's in her (already ample) abdomen.  She's in pain.  She's on 'pee pills', but they aren't helping a whole lot yet.  

I had to take the train back to Toronto today, even though she starts treatment tomorrow.  I'm on the train now.  I don't want to be here.  The burden falls on the daughter again?  Maybe not more than on my brothers, but they don't express their emotions as much.  And don't have Mum saying, tearfully, ""I'm okay...my girl's here for the weekend"" within earshot.  Not that I can do anything.  This kind of chemo is much easier than the first kind and the same as the second go-round.  But it is the kind that made her finger and toenails become so infected and sore that most of them fell off.  Most of them still don't look normal two years later.

I feel like I should be doing more with my life, even though I'm stretched to the limit.  I'm a Momma's girl in the worst, most emotionally retarded way of anyone of my acquaintance.  I haven't grown up yet because Mum's always there to take care of me.  She raised us on our own at the expense of her own personal life, really, so I don't know how to function properly on a grown-up level sometimes.  I love my mum.  I know she's tougher than this, but I'm scared all the same.  Being in another city this time around makes it all the harder.  I don't have close friends there yet.  I can't be there to hold her hand or clean the house or make her green tea (to make her pee!  Hee!)

Hopefully, this will be over soon.  Hopefully, this time her meds won't stop working for years and years and years.

It sounds corny, but now I feel like I should belong to something bigger.  I'm going to try to go to the Homes Not Bombs event tomorrow night, but it could be tricky given that I'll a) be exhausted and b) be distracted.  Also, now that the government's gone to pot, I want to figure out how I can volunteer for the NDP AND work AND find a part-time job AND sort out my academic life while not breaking down.  Gah.  I'm sick of life being work and television (which overlap a lot.)  I want to graduate.  Mum's getting her passport photo done now, before her hair falls out, so that she can be there.  I can't wait."

<u>Shitty bit 1:</u>

I booked a ticket online to go to London next Friday.  I'm going to a taping of Absolute Power.  This is good stuff.  I'm a neurotic person, so I always double-check things before the transaction goes through.  Apparently, I didn't check well enough, because printed on the ticket (which arrived today) is ""Valid with Senior Railcard"" rather than ""Valid with Young Person's Railcard.""  After my initial heart attack, I called The Train Line and was told that I could either a) hope for a nice guard who would be smart enough to know that a Senior and Young Person's Railcard have the same discount rate or b) refund the tickets and get new ones, which would cost ten pounds in fees.  Fuck me, that fucking sucks. 

I don't have ten pounds to spare at the moment.  I have about thirty pounds to get me through the next three weeks.  That's it.  My loan hasn't come through, I never did find work (no one will hire people who aren't around at Christmas), and I like to eat sometimes.  And, stupidly, I decided to go to the movies this week.  How daft am I?  Very.

I have a little bit of money left on my credit card, but I really can't use it.  At all.  I need to live in Toronto for three months starting mid-January.

Shit.

<u>Shitty bit 2:</u>

An extension of Shitty bit 1.  Student loans.  I fucked up in undergraduate too much.  What the hell am I doing here?  No one should consider postgraduate studies, especially overseas, without some kind of funding. 

The reason for this little outburst is simple.  I did a Google search on a couple of high achievers from my high school.  They are still overachievers.  With lots of research grants.  Who are already working on their PhDs.  And doing other things like playing on the National Volleyball team or lobbying government.  I <i>shouldn't care</i>, but I do.  I'm just someone who will be unemployable and unprepared for further graduate studies when I graduate.  Feh feh feh.

And, honestly, it can't be that hard to get some scholarships.  I've met some extremely daft people here on Rotary scholarships, including a semi-redneck from Texas who was strangely proud that he was 22 and had checked the ""Do not register to vote"" box when he renewed his driver's license and this insane chick from California who yelled ""Why do Canadians even celebrate Thanksgiving?"" and then got all uppity when I tried to explain that a) there were originally more than 13 colonies (""Yes, but only thirteen rose up against the British!""), b) that Thanksgiving is actually a Christian idea and c) that it's a celebration of the harvest and the harvest is earlier in Canada, hence we celebrate in October.  (""Yes, but were there Canadians there when we shared the corn with the Indians?"")

I wish to fuck that I had heard about these scholarships before I got here.  It seems like a pretty sweet deal, even if you have to go to a lot of weird little meetings and functions.  And you don't need a brain, I guess.

(And thank some higher power that there were some sane people at the Thanksgiving dinner, including a cute Aussie who did all the dishes and a VERY nice guy who, it turns out, is from the small town in Oklahoma where my oldest friend is (temporarily) living.  AND there was at least one dumbass Canadian there.  Very dumbass.  But he was also 17 and had been drinking heavily.)

<u>Shitty bit 3:</u>

I presented my programme proposal yesterday.  My tutor essentially said ""That's a cracking idea!  It's really brilliant!  But could you put famous people in it?""

<u>Shitty bit 4:</u>

Love Actually was kind of shit.  It was a mess, but a mostly likeable mess.  Mostly.  I'm also scared of how thin Keira Knightley is and how Emma Thompson is so brilliant in such an underwritten role.  Annoying Flatmate got very angry that not everyone was so enamoured with the film as her.

I love Emma Thompson dearly.  I want her to be my drinking buddy, along with Gen, Doug and Amy Wynn from Trading Spaces, Stephen Fry (Hugh Laurie can come too), and Louis Theroux.

I went to the country on Sunday with C & B.  They are a very quiet couple.  I babbled all day to fill the strange silence.  I didn't like it much.  Plus, it rained all day, so Avebury, West Kennet, and the White Horse of Uffington weren't as impressive as they could have been since I was absolutely soaked and freezing.  Plus, I wanted to get a photo of C & B together, which is difficult when you can't focus for the rain.

'When the children of the ""Sesame Street"" generation reach their high-school and college history lessons, how will they react to traditional textbooks, collections of documents, or colored maps as visual aids?  Even films that worked well in classrooms a decade ago may not be fast paced enough or suitably engrossing for today's young critics.'

So, I wanted to be in the ""Healthy"" BMI range when I went home for Christmas, but I've come to another stall.  I'm not that miserable, though, since I've started weight-training again.  It's fabulous.  I want a weight set for Christmas.  I want to be <a href=""http://www.stumptuous.com/weights.html"">Mistress Krista</a>.  

Actually, I have fitness goals that I want to focus on instead of weight goals.  

1.  To use a bicycle as a primary mode of transportation.
2.  To run for thirty minutes without stopping.
3.  To do a chin-up.

I mean, for someone who has only taken one photography course (only 4 darkroom sessions, IIRC) four years ago, I didn't do too badly.  I got the film loaded onto a reel in the dark, no problem, but I forgot the little black tubey thing to help make the development tank light-tight.  So I think I lost a shot or two.  Better than losing the whole roll, though.

My bigger problem is the same one that plagued me last time too; I cannot for the life of me use a focus-finder.  I can't see a bloody thing through it, to be perfectly honest.  I see light.  I run it all over the projected image...and see light.  It's incredibly frustrating with photos that don't have sharp lines.  Like the photo that I most wanted developed, which is a group shot from my <a href=""http://members.rogers.com/megmcleod/people.jpg"">going-away party</a>.  Though, to be fair, it could just have been taken out of focus since it was dark, we were drunk, and my ex-manager, who is nearly legally blind, might have taken it.

Despite the setbacks, I had a blast.  Two hours of freedom to fiddle around with the knobs on the enlarger, watch images magically appear on blank paper, and inhale powerful chemicals. I'm really looking forward to going back (twice!) this week.  On Wednesday, I'm going on a day-trip up North and I hope to get some good shots in.  Hopefully good enough for Christmas presents.

1.  Who moves to a country without a basic sense of its geography?
2.  Is it important for someone in INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS to want to know this kind of information in advance?
3.  If you intend to travel, shouldn't you buy your own damned travel guide?

After I told her how I had been to Shakespeare-Upon-Twee, she decided that she was going to go and started thumbing through the guide again.  I told her ""It's in Warwickshire.  Check the index.""  She started giggling about how much she ""loves"" the placenames here.  ""Warwickshyre, Leicestershyre...""  

Worst, though, is that she says ""Balti food.""  As in, ""We went out for Balti food and I just *LOVE* saying Chicken Tikka Masala!!""

"event","Well, so much for going to the gym first thing.  I couldn't sleep last night, so at 7 this morning I convinced myself that it would be a bad idea to try to work out when I was so tired.  (And I didn't much fancy walking there in near-darkness.)  Which means I have to figure out when I can go this evening.  I have an off-peak membership, which means that there are certain hours of the day where I can't go.  Feh."

"event","Well, I had a nice entry written and then I went and hit the scrolling touch pad thing and it all disappeared.  Terrific. 

I'm in Birmingham.  I'm not hating it.  I hope I will be updating more often.

I'm also using this as a half-assed venting-about-wobbly-bits journal for bitching about the fact that I'm supposedly 11lbs from a healthy BMI, but my lower half is still awfully wobbly.  Feh.

And I'm pre-spazzing about my work placement and dissertation.  Aiyeeeee."

"event","Everyone at work's minds reside within The Dirty Place at all times.  Seriously.  Sexual harrassment is an expectation.  Showing off porn faces is not uncommon (well, from one staffer, anyway.)  Last night was a doozy of an evening.  M ran up to me between shows and his best, most deadpan voice (which he uses when he's going to do something humiliating or annoying) said ""Lee told me to ask you if you're fellating Artboy.""  The fuck?  Where did that come from?  And the projectionist has decided that it would be hilarious to tell everyone we're having some kind of torrid affair this summer.  At least he warned me so I can shout ""DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD THAT MAN SAYS"" when I see him talking to anyone.

No, I'm not that bothered.  I have two brothers and I can be pretty icky myself.  Never this icky, though.  It is interesting to be the slut at work, even though I haven't done anything.  (For a really, really long time.  Feh.)

Work was pretty interesting this weekend, especially on Saturday.  There was an injured cat outside the theatre all day, so much of the shift was spent plotting about how to catch it (it was limping, but could still run crazy fast.)  Despite our best intentions, and managing to corner it, it got away, giving me the craziest scratch on my pinky finger (which the beast used as a launching pad.)  I hope he's going to be okay.

Did the kids on Saved By The Bell ever even contemplate sex?  I've never seen a whole episode, but it seems to me that they didn't.

My first <a href=""http://www.dragonboat.net"">Dragon Boat Race</a> practice was on Friday and it took me two days to recover.  Stupidly, I forgot about that whole stretching before and after thing.  Even more stupidly, I didn't really think of of it as being so bloody competitive.  We had a mini practice race at the end of the session against two other teams and came in a fairly distant third.  And it was murderously painful.  Ack.  Because you lean out over the side of the boat, I felt completely lopsided all weekend.  Luckily, my next practice is on Wednesday right before a yoga class, so I can be a melty ball of jelly by the end of the day.  Yay!

"event","Wow.  What a ridiculous emotional rollercoaster of a day I had.  Ridiculous because I barely left the house.  Hell, I barely left this chair.  I spent about six and a half hours with the DCWs today, which has to be some sort of slacker record. (I love you all, really, I do, but yikes!)

A few weeks ago, I applied for my federal and provincial student loans.  I found out today, however, that I don't qualify for the provincial ones since the province doesn't have an official agreement with the University of Birmingham.  A total crock of shit, if you ask me.  It means that several thousand dollars that I was relying on is actually not a possibility at all.  Which means I cried today.  A lot.  Which is quite rare.

But, as I said, I spent a really long time in chat where everyone was absolutely lovely and understanding and supportive.  I just can't believe that I have such a strong support group among people that I've never met.  It's such a new experience for me, even though I've been at 3wa for nearly a year and a half.

I'm so glad the boards aren't closing yet.  It will make moving overseas a lot easier knowing that these wonderful people are there for me.

On another note, I've finally made amends with the public library and took out four M.C. Beatons (mmmm...brain candy!), <i>The World According to Garp</i>, Robertson Davies' <i>Tempest-Tost</i>, and this guide to organising your life, intended for teenagers, that the Divine <a href=""http://sarahjanet.diaryland.com"">SJ</a> recommended.  It's nice when something absolutely free can perk you up."

"event","So, last night at work, I got verbally abused by two very drunk, possibly homeless, men who tried to come see the movie.  They got all the change that they had earned and dumped in on the counter.  This is a common occurence.  I told them that they had clearly been drinking, were being pretty damned rude, and that I wouldn't sell them a ticket.  

One of them shouted ""FUCK YOU!  THIS FUCKING THEATRE SUCKS!  WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A FUCKING HOUR!""  The other put his ear up to the microphone (yah, I know) and tried to talk to me in a quiet mumble.  The quiet mumbler came back an hour later and was quite polite when I turned him away again.  (He didn't have enough money anyway.)

This is really quite typical, actually, which is both scary (I am so grateful for the plexiglas prison that is the box office) and terribly sad.  And, strangely, the cops had been parked right outside not long before this talking to some of the regular homeless people who hang out near the theatre (including one, 'Donnie', who we have to call them about on a regular basis for verbally abusing customers and staff.)  

Homelessness is a pretty big problem in Ottawa and it's getting worse.  Despite being a bleeding-heart liberal-type person, I have to admit that guys like the drunks from last night really scare me.  Walking back to the car made me hold my keys in a way that self-defense classes tell you to (or, rather, the self-defense classes I've seen sitcom characters take.  I really should take a real class.)

In other scary news, I had a dream last night that my friend MathGirl (I'm experimenting with nicknames right now) was murdered and that I knew it was going to happen.  ""I knew that when we said goodbye on Sunday that she'd be gone by Wednesday!  I KNEW IT!""

I've had premonitions before.  I hope to God/dess/Magic Fish that this isn't one."

How's that for an intro?

To be honest, I don't know what to do with this space yet.  Since 3wa is shutting down and I really, really don't want to lose touch with the many wonderful people I have met, I reckon this is the best way to do it."

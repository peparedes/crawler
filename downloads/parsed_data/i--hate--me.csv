Just today Putin comes out supporting the charges that Saddam Hussein worked with Osama Bin Laden and Al Queda.
Why don't they just get it over with and have a big, sloppy threesome.  
Maybe then we'd see less of our men dying.  


Sorry to get political, I'm just sayin'.

get this...

i get home from school, and see that my answering machine is going nuts

so i hit the button and there are lik e 20 messages in a row of my mom all weeping.  i knew it the second that i heard her voice....

something had happened to the stuntsman.

you see, over the past few years, my folks have never really taken well to the stuntsman.   it'd be fair to say that he never really took to anyone besides me.  hell, he'd even bitten the mess out of rasher one time.

anyway, i asked them to take him from yesterday (thurs) to this monday so i could get some of this god damn homework done.  so i assumed everything would be fine.   apparently not....

according to mom's message, she and dad had gone upstairs probably to screw (she said they had a talk), and the next thing they knew, the house was filled with *splashing* sounds.  i guess the stuntsman got into one of the bathrooms to catch a nice drink of water and got his muzzle stuck in the toilete.   they said he was all flinging and flopping around.  i wonder if they even bothered pulling him out of the thing, which eventually ended up being the end of my brown friend.  

so yeah, they just watched him drown in pool of blood and piss.   so right now i'm grieving and not speaking to my idiot folks.

today i dedicate the entire use of live journal to the memory of the stuntsman, the best friend i ever had...

oh the stuntsman
my beautiful, precious the stuntsman
oh how i will miss thee!
your shiny coat, your razor sharp teeth
your malicious bark already haunts my dreams
i will try and move on my slobbering friend
i will call rasher and upset him in your honor
i will pour my forty over the grave i dug you tonight
oh the stuntsman 
how i will miss thee

the whole ""hey look i'm a spazz but i'm still a cool rock-guy"" act is so transparent.
he reminds me of these scenester/hipster idiots i know here in town.
anyhoo
today i'm doing lots of ironing because i hate wrinkled clothes.
rasher would always just pull out some tshirt that would be crumpled up in the wash for days and just wear it.
it was disgusting.  i recall this one biohazard shirt that smelled like vomit and looked like he tried to force it into his pocket or something.
also, i drank a little human blood at craig shand's party last night and it was fucking repulsive.  so you ""vamps"" out there are nuts, basically.  how gross.
so who as been posting in my journal with a suspended account??  i wish i could read what you wrote...oh well.
i wonder if you-know-who got suspended for being a rude bitch??? hmmmm....
so yeah, that's basically it.  tonight i'm watching the fight on hbo cause that hottie, corrie sanders, is fighting.  he is smokin' hot.
after that i plan on tripping my balls off.

have a great weekend.

i stopped the car and told him straight out that he was wrong for stealing that huge phone out of the pontiac.  all this did was make him even more upset!  he stood up as though he was gonna chase me.  i slid the tranny into 'D' cause i was gonna get the heck outta there.  so anyway, he stood up and it was at that moment i noticed that his pants were down and he had no underwear!!! so i'm like 'fuck all this' and i sped off.  in my rearview mirror, the man was actually chasing me, running as fast as he could, with this chewed up, dangling dick all flopping around everywhere.  so just when i thought this whole thing couldn't possibly get any more strange, i look back up in the mirror just to catch this fucking weirdo actually SHITTING AT A FULL SPRINT! i couldn't believe my eyes.  a grown man sprinting while these little brown pieces collapsing to the hot pavement out of his butt.  he was screaming something at me and crying.  i didn't think it was possible to shit while running your hardest.
anyway, so i finally outran him (i drive an 1985 honda crx with sick ass autozone rims) and that was my day.  i just went home and watched sopranos and curb' with the stuntsman (who i will mention, has finally shown an inkling, a SEMBLANCE of his former beautiful self).
so how is everyone?

"event","So after alllll these months of inactivity, I have news to report:
The Stuntsman is very upset...
I took him outside the other night for a movement and he just seemed weird.  I looked down, and he barked up at me out of nowhere.  He wouldn't stop!  So I asked what was bothering him, and he kind of replied in English.
This is what it sounded like:

The Stuntsman: ""AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHH!!""

Me:  ""So what is it, idiot?""

The Stuntsman: ""BAAAARRRRRRRRSSSSSGGGHH""

It was so weird!  These long yarps on and on and on.  I wish I could decipher these ramblings.  Anyone have any suggestions??  

I finally looked him over and found a splinter in his bottom.  He's still very upset.  I wonder if one of those dog shrinks like in 'Best in Show' could help.  Hmmmmmm....

Very frustrated and desperate!

I <3 The Stuntsman

i immerse myself in the dark side of life and strive within that blackness.
i care not for those who try to shove christianity down my throat.
i do care, however, for rasher shoving his beautiful penis down that same throat.
oh how i miss him.
are these simply the trials and tribulations of one goth woman's life?
going from boy to boy, simply not caring...not loving in the slightest.  
i long for rasher.  he consumes me like jabba consumed those little frog things in 'return of the jedi'.
oh well.  i guess in the end whether or not i'm a senseless, numb pile or a vivid dream of some goth guy or girl this whole thing is one big learning experience.
also, i've been seeing pictures that i like alot lately and i thought i'd share a couple of them with you.

They never broke they never came off they never let me down! Well not like Rasher can or The Stuntsman for that matter. I've just had such bad luck with those close to me lately. No one wants to have fun anymore we've all go to ""grow up."" What the fuck is that about? When was it a crime not to settle for less. I'm never going to let the fun run out! I swear upon these days of the fair maidens that this child will never be an old lame-o! 
Why is it that I can wear the same pants for days on end and no one says anything but the second I put on the same shirt from yesterday people are all harping on me that I've got such poor hygiene? Screw that shit, I don't wear my lazy clothes to the gym and when I get home I always shower before putting the lazy clothes on. So get off my back! Jesus, I just get so bored of having to fit in some sort of perfect ""American"" stereotype of being clean and tidy. I mean really, why is it that I can't just live my life without everyone around me trying to hone in and pressure me into being something that I'm not - the girl next door. Maybe if the girl next door had an unkept bush and smelly pits. Oh well, I just had to get that off my chest. Nighty-nite!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

nobody sent anything?
fine then.
i'll just ADD 50 people to my friends list
i cannot be stopped or contained
i will add friends until there are no more of you self centered exhibitionists to add
there isn't a poem or a batch of lyrics that can save you 
no wailing entry about your love life matters
you will all remain on my list and show me you're boobs whether you like it or not!
i am unstoppable, even though I__HATE__ME
i am your worst nightmare

so i'd like to make a simple request.  do with it what you must;

<b>will all the women who read my journal please submit, by let's say next wednesday, a pic of their naked breasts?</b>

it's not alot to ask, is it?  i'm a woman too, and i must admit that i am attracted to girls as well as boys.

to all the boys out there, if you feel like you need to submit pics of your man-tits, than so be it.

here is a pic of my small breasts!

they're getting all up-in-arms because i've written some really racy lyrics for our latest song:

""follow that trail of piss up my leg
with your tongue
perhaps you'd like to fertilize my egg
ouch! that stung!
i'm in to taking a dump on you're face
men and women alike, doesn't matter the race
'cause i'm steamin' for a good humpin'
if you let me swat you around, i may give you a lil somethin somethin
i'm into pain and suffering
or rather
giving that ass of yours a whip-buffering
baby baby baby baby baby baby
stop cryin like a fucking baby
whinin' more than the stuntsman would
weeping like only a blairshynola DUDE could
i'm sick and fucking tired....""

that's where i've ended the lyrics.  the guys in the band are pretty upset about 'em.  i think that they're awesome.   who wants to hear some boring ass emo crap anyways.

so anyway, yeah i'm bored.  just sitting here with nothing to do.  my leg's doing fine now, if any of you are concerned.   i need to find some drugs.

"event","i'm so tired of all this bickering and fighting.  so i'm going to start today off with an original and uplifting poem, by yours truly:

*gack!* the aroma of the morning breeze brings flush to my skin
i have but a small amount of room for these things
because i long for the night
windows down cruising down I70 with glen danzig blaring the stuntsman's ears out
small healing wounds on my inner arm from light dashes with dad's razor
rasher's long eyelashes
like willows on schandman's swamp
SWAY SWAAY SWAAAAAAAYING around and about
i'll never forget the tattoo that he dedicated in my honor
placed square on his bridge, between his asshole and his nuts
it read ""I HATE ME"" and it makes me cry to this day
such an act of love
then taking an act of LEAVE
how does one live up to such high expectations?
he is simply my dark hero, a dark messiah if you will
setting lofty examples for us all left and right
right and left
up and down
DOOOOOWN
so i live my days
with only a couple friends, mostly drug dealers
and a brown mess with a wagging tail
who once tried to eat my leg
what an asshole
but he's here, yes, he's always here
like the honeypot doldrums of my life
and the days continue....

interpret these as you wish!

"event","but there's actually a BIGGER FUCKING MORON than alig and carsondaily.   it's blairshynola.   he transends the common gay man.   a complete wigger mixed with all the pretentious components that the white belt emo art fag displays.   he's got his little vintage panties in a wad because i went and defended myself in alig's lousy journal and he attempted to diss me but as usual, my whit got the best of him.   so now he's threatening to kick me off lj, which almost made me choke laughing when i first read it, and he's also ""going to find me"" which i invite with all of the hospitality i can muster.  i'd like nothing more than to make a wicked emo belt out of his embarassingly small cock and balls.    then i'll whip alig with it as she begs me to eat her out.    

anyway, today is a fine day.   me and the stuntsman are quietly enjoying the silence of a wonderful spring day.   i have band practice tonight and i'm going to integrate some lyrics about alig, carson, and blairshynola into our new song ""waging a jihad on blairshynola's pimpled ass""

So on top of being depressed about not being able to do anything besides go to school and then come home and think about Rasher, I've also got to deal with these two horrible human beings, <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/carsondaily>Carson Daly</a> and <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/alig>alig</a>. 

Why is it that some people have to come down on your for just living life the best you can. So things have gotten ugly between the three of us and I'm now going to try and be the grown-up here. alig, you can take that stank ass puss and toss yourself right off the bridge across the northlands cause you suck and you'll never not suck. BITCH!!! 

Carson ... well you can just watch as your friends start disappearing cause I know what's going on and don't you go thinking I don't see the strings you MTV pile of poo poo water. 

Sorry to all the friends that had to see that little rant but I'm not done!!!!! I know my journal has been nothing but negativity lately and I really hate that it has, although credit must be given to the charlatans ... the canaries in our midst. 

Thanks to those of you who have shown true supportin my time of need. To those (you know who you are) who haven't I leave you with this.

perhaps someday we'll see, FRIEND

i've fallen down like 8 fucking times.  the stuntsman can't really see the wound anymore, so he's not nipping.   i'm so tired of being alone.  all i can think about is rasher and his danzig tapes.  when he dumped me, he left this danzig mix tape for me with a personally designed cover.  it broke my heart, and then i did acid for the next week straight.   i haven't done crank since i messed up my leg, but i'd try it again if you can promis me it won't make me nervous.  well, i gotta get to rehab.  bye now!

"event","gawd i miss rasher.  he was such a hottie.  black hair, pierced, cock pierced....
*aaaaaaah man*
he went off to school in france.  i'll probably never see him again.
anyway, the leg is still completely fucked.  i appreciate all the letters and friendly posts.  it's nice to know that u all are my new friends.
i'd like to conclude this entry with a poem, if you will:

strange lives
even stranger than the men and women out on my street
how dare we doubt the strength of ibuprofen
tracers bewilder my every thought
4 hits of blotter, a couple tokes later
that stunt man cartwheeled out of my room
he left a battered piece
it may smell great if micorwaved
but now youre banned

goodnight everyone!

*mwah*

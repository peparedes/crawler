I hate feeling that way, watching from the sidelines unable to do anything.
I wanted to be there for Jay, but it was hard when all I could do was pat his back and tell him everything would be okay.

Earlier when I ran into HeeChul, I spoke to him about Jay- as well as did other things.
Hopefully everything is okay now, I haven't heard from either of them since then. 

Ah... I wish I could do more for my friends."

It seems things are always changing for me,
We're always moving on...

It's not that it's a bad thing, just sometimes, it's scary.

I was afraid to move on, and so I clung to JungWoo's memory,
and when we made up, I clung to him.
It's like I built my identity around him...

He and I had a long talk, and, we've decided to break up.

I'm not in a rush to go and settle down again,
But I'd really like to see what's out there. 

I mean hey- I'm only twenty-two!

Well, don't worry your pretty little... noses... Because here I am!

Though I've been busy lately, things have been better than ever! I've been working on my acting, and I'm still performing at clubs with The Romantist, and then there's modeling... And University! So much to do! I like it though, it's exciting, and it makes me feel important. I like knowing that I have things to do.

Today, I was reading through my old entries, and I saw this, from December-

<center><i>""Perhaps I'm stupid-

Maybe a little naive-

But this will be settled.""</i></center>

I couldn't help but smile when I read that, because I was right! Things have changed so much since back then... Jay and I are on speaking terms, the same goes for HeeChul and I, and I'm SO grateful for that. I've been hanging around the Trax apartment lately, because now I don't have to be afraid that Jay and HeeChul would stop by and verbally (or physically X_X) tear me apart. They were both really valuable friends to me at one time, and I hope that we can get to that point again. Can someone give me a hwaiting? ^_^

I just want to go through a brief overview of my life for the past couple years

-I was in The Trax
-I started fighting with JungWoo
-JungWoo and I broke up
-I left the Trax
-Everyone hated me!
-I ran into HeeChul at a club
-Things got interesting from there >_>'
-I ran into Jay and JungWoo at HeeChul's party
-Everybody still hated me
-I ran into JungWoo at a bar
-Things got even MORE interesting >_>''' and everybody but him and HeeChul still hated me
-Things ended between HeeChul and I, HeeChul and Jay were dating, JungWoo and I were dating
-I met JungMo at the cafe, we became friends again
-Jay still hated me.
-HeeChul's accident
-TRAX fight, Jay STILL hated me
-HeeChul started hating me x_X'
-Lots of Hate!
-Jay and I spoke
-HeeChul REALLY hated me. Like, REALLY.
-Jay and I spoke more while he was staying with the Jungies, and we made up!
-HeeChul and I made up! ^-^

Aish- I've been hated a lot this year! I'm really glad things are all better now... Looking back on all of that, it's amazing to me how things managed to work out at all. 

Ahh... Now maybe there will be some peace in my life, though. I could use some!

Always ALiCE
Forever MinWoo

My mind tells me that I shouldn't be feeling sympathetic towards him,

And then my guilt begins to grow.

But they get better. I can say this from experience.

HeeChul and I ""broke up""- not like we were ever REALLY dating in the first place. Turns out both of us are in love with different people. It's like a soap opera, really, just minus the pregnancy, the evil twins, and with a happy ending. 

You two were meant to be together. Congratulations!

As for myself-

Things will be weird for awhile, I know that. But I feel that our love can guide us through this. All of the tears were worth it, if I can just end up in your arms once again. 

I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

I'm sorry for all of the cruel things I've said when we were fighting.

I'm sorry for not trying harder, and just turning my back.

Obviously, I lied.

<lj-cut text=""'I'll never fall in love again,' she said."">

At one time, long ago, I honestly thought that we were meant to be together. Even after a year of trying so hard to convince myself that I <i>hate</i> you, I have to question myself- what if I went back to you? Would you take me in your arms like you used to? Maybe, if I apologized to you, we could kiss and make up, and everything would be all better. Because when we were together, things were perfect.

I guess, in my young age, I was very naive. I'm no princess, and there is certainly no prince waiting around the bend to slay whatever dragon there be to save me. I know very well now that there is no way we could ever be together again. I was stupid for ever thinking so, even if it was just a little bit. I've tried to move on, but... my heart still aches for you, and I hate myself for it. When we broke up, do you even know how much I cried? And every time we fought after that- did you even <i>know</i> that I spent those nights in my apartment, sobbing, wishing that you would just waltz in and make me feel better?

So- I left. But I didn't just leave for me- I left for you, and for Jay and JungMo, as well. I could tell how it was tearing us all apart, whenever you and I fought. I hoped that maybe by leaving, I could salvage at least some sort of friendship between myself and at least Jay and JungMo, but I know that Jay hates me too-probably almost as much as you do. But... I won't say I regret it. Because if I didn't leave, then it would've been my fault that the Trax dissolved, and I would never want that. 

I don't know why I'm writing this to you like you're going to read it- but... If for SOME reason you are... I want you to know that I loved you more than life itself. I don't want to set myself up for getting hurt anymore, though.

I think this stopped making sense a long time ago... I suppose that's all, then. This is the last bit of Princess Rose No MinWoo's heart you'll ever see, so treasure it.

Yeah. I must be stupid, thinking I could work things out with him. It's like I can't talk to him without one of us getting angry, and I don't want that.

Or maybe it's because I'm the 'Band Leader,' this time around. Whatever it is, I'm SWAMPED! So many papers to fill out, people to contact, shows to book...

By the way! We had our first show last month in a little club- it went really well! I was really happy to see a lot of familiar faces there, I'm so thankful for my fans who have stuck with me.

Bass: Park Jukyung

Eh, I'm not going to worry about it. It's not worth it.

But- on a better note, I also ran into Junsu! JUNNIEEEEE~! I've missed you! He and I spent the day hanging out- we even went to the Arcade and played DDR for awhile. He OWNED me at it, but eh- it should be expected! He's just as youthful and full of energy as I remember, I had a great time hanging out with him.

Junsu, if you're reading this, we have to get together again! And, someday I'll beat you at DDR! SOMEDAY!

Just... not for awhile XD'

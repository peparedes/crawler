"event","Another shameless post, perhaps even more shameless than all the others but there you go.

Nominations for Xtra West's community achievement awards close on APRIL 1. THAT'S THIS SATURDAY! It's super easy to nominate someone and I'm humbly asking that you consider nominating me for Achievement in the Arts--Live Performance of the Year and/or Writer of the Year.

This year I will be hosting the show for the 2nd time yet I have never been nominated for an award. Please help me rectify this nonsense.

If you think that I deserve a nomination for my performance of my one-woman show Girls Like Me (either live or via podcast), my hosting of Cabaret Q, the Dyke March (2 years in a row) or Stilletos & Strap-Ons, or my producing efforts via Pink Vixen Comedy Arts including The Mobtown Moxie Revue, Cabaret Q, I'll Show You Mine if You Show Me Yours or for my monthly Xtra West column Siren, please visit:

http://www.xtra.ca/hero/

and fill in the really quick nomination form.

I appreciate your support.

"event","As everyone knows, I'm very pretty, but not so good with the technology. Lucky for me, I have brilliant friends like Robert-John Farrow of wayoutwest.tv who are far more clever than I (and almost as pretty). 

Rob has made these podcast thingers for me and now you can bring my hilarity into your very own home via your computer or take it wherever you want via your video iPod business. I don't know how it works but Rob says you just have to click here: 
http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=135978893&s=143455 
and you'll go right to the Girls Like Me page in the iTunes store. If you don't have iTunes then it's a free download. There will be a 10 sketch series from my one-person/many character show Girls Like Me. Yippee! 

Please click the iTunes SUBSCRIBE button and each new sketch will automatically download when it's put up online. A new sketch every Sunday night! The more people who subscribe to the Girls Like Me series the more chance I have of...well, I don't really understand it all but Rob says I'm supposed to encourage everyone to subscribe and to do so soon because that affects something and then something good will happen. So please do. 

Also, you can write reviews of each sketch if you feel so inclined. And I hope you will. 

If the above link doesn't work, go here: http://www.wayoutwest.tv/girls_like_me_comedy_video.html and click on the iPod icon. If that link doesn't work, go to www.wayoutwest.tv and click on my face. And if that doesn't work then you're clearly even more of a luddite than I am and doomed to just read books for the rest of your life. How sad. 

If you don't have or want to download iTunes then you can still watch the episodes in other formats on wayoutwest.tv 

Please help me get famous on the interweb without having to appear in porn. I surely would appreciate it. And you will probably laugh so it's a pretty fair exchange really. 

Your friend,

"event","Today was spent rushing madly against the clock to get applications into the Uno Festival and the Oh Solo Mio festival for my one-person/many character show, Girls Like Me.  If anyone has any connections at these fests, put a good word in for me, would you?  Weird that they would announce the festivals today and give a deadline of tomorrow, don't you think?  Okay, they didn't announce them today, they announced them a million years ago but I don't do anything until the 11th hour.  Or later.

I really need to learn to plan ahead, plan for the future, think about the future, get off the couch...but it's just so unappealing.  Why everything doesn't just fall right into my lap when and how I want it to is, frankly, beyond me.  That's not just my only-child-middle-class-upbringing talking, it's my laziness too.  Because I am multi-faceted. 

In other news, I have decided to keep writing my Xtra West column, Siren, for another year.  Please send topic suggestions my way as I have none and need 12.

In other other news, we start writing next week for a live show called The Snides of March.  As suspected, it will take place in March.  Three weeks of 8 shows a week.  I need a nap just thinking about it.  It's me, Linda Cullen & Bob Robertson (Double Exposure), Trevor Duval, Peter New and Penelope Corrin.  It's about Vancouver...BC...Canada politics and culture.  The impression thing has got me a little worried.  Those who know me know that I do an UNCANNY Carol Channing but beyond that, impressions aren't really my thing.  What Vancouver/Canadian celebrities do I look like?  Jamie Lee Hamilton?  (No thanks) Jann Arden (um...)  Jim Green?  (Peter and I will have to fight over him)  Oh, I don't know. Please send sketch ideas as I have none and need...to hold my own on my first big show and not get fired on the second day for being stupid.  

Oh, and speaking of Girls Like Me, Rob is updating the website and there are some photos from the show up on the homepage now.  Coming in January...PODCASTS!  Whatever the flip they are.  As I understand it, little magical Morgans will fly around the world and into people's Ipod thingers and do sketches for them.  I am the wave of the future.

"event","My old VCR which I bought with the money from my first gig on Neon Rider finally died.  Unfortunately, it died in the middle of watching stuff to put together for my new demo reel.  So, I need a new one.  

I know they're cheap to buy but I figure someone probably has one they don't use/want anymore that they might want to get rid of and I could get it for free.  

I have a Braun coffeemaker in perfectly good condition that you could have in exchange if you wanted it. Oh, and I am about to throw out a gazillion scraps (big chunks) of fabric that I've been saving for way too long figuring I was going to do something with it.  If anyone knows the skirts I make, it's leftover fabric from those.  Because of the shape of the skirt's panels, there are wide pieces left over that could be used for crafting or smaller sewing projects.  Light pink sparkly, hot pink, black.  Whether you have a VCR or not, you're welcome to have this fabric.  But let me know quicklike as my girfriend is coming to town today and she loves to tidy and throw things out.  Something about me leaving things in the hallway for months on end or something.  I don't know.

Let me know if you can help.  

Thanks.

Hmmm...

Penn and Teller are celebrity guests on Fear Factor.  We are truly on the eve of the apocalypse.

Other than that...

I saw a man on the news the other day who had to take the day off work to take his kids to Science World because of the teacher's strike.  He said, ""We're important people with important jobs.  They need to get back to work.""  And as I so often do, I yelled at the tv set.  (Except when House is on.  I never yell at House.  He is my boyfriend.  I would wish he was my doctor if it weren't for the fact that I have a totally hot doctor so really, I don't wish that.)  I feel like we need some kind of public education about union history and the point of striking.  If parents value teachers, why don't they make phone calls and write letters and make some noise in support of the teachers?  Now, I know that when I was in school I had some pricks for teachers.  Fair enough.  But I do believe that, for the most part, these people chose to teach because they cared about young people.  Anyone who has (like me) had anything to do with teaching knows that it ain't about the money.  Oh, sure, in the beginning you think you're making mad cash.  But the amount of work involved outside of class, let alone the work inside class quickly ensures that you understand you will earn your money every damn day.  And I teach ""adults"" at a film school, for fuck sake!  Young people?!  Every day?!  Sweet Jesus!  You know what, you couldn't pay me enough to deal with 10 year old boys every day all day, forget about teenagers.  I won't even have children myself for fear of screwing them up royally, let alone look after 30+ other people's kids without relevant text books for most of their subjects in a way overcrowded classroom without teching support or parent/societal support.  Forget about teaching special needs or ESL students.  Jesus, people.  Where are our priorities?  Anyhow, for anyone interested in supporting the teachers and their ""illegal"" strike, you can go to: http://www.bctf.bc.ca/

Penn is talking and Teller is driving race cars against Rudy from The Cosby Show and Greg from The Brady Bunch as well as eating cockroaches.

I am trying to love my acting students the way I love my writing students.  It's hard.  Some of them are so great.  And I don't just mean they are great actors.  They aren't, necessarily.  I just mean they love what they do and put effort into it.  I try to remind myself that I was 20 once too and maybe didn't invest myself the way I should have because I didn't appreciate how rare it is to get to focus on what you want to do or even what you wonder if you might want to do.  But I guess I think that if I'd paid (or, in most cases, if my parents had paid) $X,000 for me to go to acting school, I'd put a little effort into it.  Meanwhile, I have writing students falling apart because they are working their asses off and can't keep up, don't feel like they are achieving what they should, continually qualify their work.  And my acting students are cuddling and massaging each other while I'm trying to teach them.  Good Lord.  Was I ever like that?  Probably.

Just had a very, very fun weekend with my baby in Seattle.  My first time visiting her there.  Got to go to the Lesbian Coffee Shop (but didn't buy a pink lesbian cookie, Jason, although I did ogle them) and Honey Hole (home of the world's best sandwich) and shop at stores that had clothes that fit me.  But mostly, I just got to be with my Jack which was so great.  We had a blast on Saturday.  We went to a place that made The Duff look like the Ritz.  We drank Pabst Blue Ribbon on tap (and lived to tell the tale) and I even got so drunk that I sang karaoke!  I had the joint rockin' with Joan Jett's I Hate Myself for Loving You.  But then I got all excited and tried to do one of my all time favourites--Travis Tritt's It's a Great Day to Be Alive which I was much too drunk for not to mention it was much too high for me to sing.  But Jack's friends are ever so lovely and my stepcats were lovely and I had a great, great time.

Penn just said, ""We're going to lose to a Cosby Kid..."" and Joe Rogan said, ""Would you rather lose to a Cosby Kid or a Brady Bunch"".  Penn and Teller both agreed that it was way better to lose to Rudy.  And they did.  But they won $10,000 for the American Civil Liberties Union.  

I guess God is in his heaven and all is right with the world."

I never imagined I would enjoy wrestling.  I don't watch it on TV, I don't understand the appeal.  When people say things like, ""It's theatre!"" I say things like ""Oh shut up...""

But here's the thing: I loved SuperGirls wrestling! It's totally theatre!  Fun theatre!  We went on Saturday night and I lost my mind.  Oh, sure, it may have been the copious amounts of alcohol we drank but who cares.  We yelled at the bad guys and cheered for the good guys and it was so fun. I even won the raffle prize--an autographed SuperGirls t-shirt.  Awww yeah...

I now want to be a wrestler. I'm taking suggestions for wrestling names so send your ideas my way!

"event","Hello lovelies: <lj-cut>

Gracious.  What a crazy time its been.  I will do my best to update without a ridiculous amount of X-treme verbosity (the only sport I play) but you know how I am...

So, my Fringe show went great.  I love Kathleen Oliver for giving me my first solo performance review and for it being such a great one.  It is simply pull-quote-a-licious!  Here's the thing...I didn't talk about it much but I was really, really scared to do this show.  Aside from various hosting duties (Dyke March, Diva's Den, etc.) and some film/tv work I haven't performed since 30 Helens.  That is, I haven't performed sketch--where my heart is--since 30 Helens.  When we broke up I didn't want to get on stage.  Couldn't.  Didn't care.  Moved full-time into producing and thank Whoopi for the Comedy Fest job which gave me something to pour my energy into.  And rip out my soul but that's another story.  Anyhow, I just wanted to produce, didn't want to perform...and then bit by bit, the itch started to come back.  Then it started to grow.  Then the itch turned into a fucking monster.  Then the Toronto festival opportunity came along.  Now, those of you who know THAT story know that it nearly broke me.  But even though 'that woman' was so, so, so horrible to me I am thankful for the opportunity.  It got me performing again.  It got me out of Vancouver to do it.  I was too scared to do it here.  So, big thanks to Mariko for recommending me (and then for rescuing me and taking care of me when crazylady was so horrible...and thanks to Stanley for healing me by trying to eat my J-Lo panties.  That was one of the best things about Toronto.  Oh...Stanley is Mariko's cat, by the way...)  Anyhow, that fest helped me realize I had an actual show, that one-person show I've been talking about doing for years, and gave me the jam to do it here in Vancouver.

I had such a great time.  It felt so good to be on stage every night saying my words, doing my thing, giving myself to an audience every night.  It was like coming home.  God, that's cheesey.  I have PMS, sorry.  But it's true.  I just felt like, ""Oh...right...this is where I belong.""  Except it wasn't really coming home because I've never felt that good performing before.  With 30 Helens, by the end there was so much shit.  So much resentment and jealousy that you couldn't be good without feeling guilty and you couldn't be good because there was so much other shit going on.  We really ran that fucker into the ground.  I wish we'd walked away sooner.  But whatever.  Point is, this was MINE.  And it felt good.  Sure, no one to rely on, no one to work off of, but no one to depend on either.  And as the only child princess that I am, I have to say I liked it better.

Of course, I only got to have it be all mine because of the 8,000 people who worked to make the thing happen.  One night I just stood backstage and got all teary thinking about how fucking blessed I am.  Aaron was so great and so funny.  Rebecca is such a rock it's crazy.  I can't believe she was still laughing in the booth by the end of the run.  Sara is just always, always willing to jump in and do anything.  Which this time meant sitting backstage every night for 3 hours flipping lights on and off depending only on audio cues since you can't see the stage from there.  My director John Murphy is such a  great guy.  Having him to hand my baby over to made this whole scary thing so much easier since I trust him implicitly.  We are so often on the exact same comedy page and he just takes everything I do and makes it 500 times funnier.  And Rob.  Jesus.  What would I do without Rob?  Enlisting Joel and making the beautiful pink and orange set, filming the show every night, being such a great collaborator, making my pretty website.  I love Rob.  Kathryn stepping in and helping with the set and being a hilarious extra in one of my sketches.  So thankful.  And the wonderful Ass Fish whom I shared the stage with so joyously.  I love them so much.  Such talent.  Such loveliness.  Such kickassness.  And my Jack.  I still don't get that some people PREFER not to be in the spotlight and to be a support but, I tell ya, I sure like it.  It feels so good to be so loved and supported.  Especially by someone as great as she is.  All those years of non-monogamous depression have finally paid off in monogamous bliss!  Yippee!  Anyhow, I am truly blessed and favoured.  Thank you all the amazing people in my life who made the show happen.  I am well, well, well aware that I couldn't have done it without you.  Hell, I couldn't even get out of bed if it weren't for you.  Thanks.

AND I PERFORMED AT THE VOGUE IN A SHOW WITH SCOTT THOMPSON!!!!  SWEET BABY JESUS!  Oy, that was cool.  Hearing one of the Kids in the Hall say, ""Ladies and gentlemen...Morgan Brayton!"" was a really great thrill.  And I am really happy with my performance.  I did something I NEVER do which is...go over time.  I am such a stickler for sticking to my alloted time.  And as a producer, I fucking hate performers who go over time.  But they wouldn't let me do Cherry Lipsmacker because of the whip cream and I really wanted to do Button and Haiku.  I don't know why but fags LOVE Button.  I've had 3 fags tell me they want to marry Button.  Funny.  And so sweet.  Anyhow, I had 12 minutes and I did like 14 or 15.  I figured that fucking festival owes me 2 or 3 minutes at the very least.  And I'm so glad I did.  I got lovely audience feedback after the show and the audience energy during my performance was amazing.  It felt so, so good.  I was like...yeah...I've seen Scott Thompson's one man show here, Eddie Izzard, Ellen Degeneres, Henry Rollins, Lea DeLaria...and now I'm standing on the same stage rocking the crowd.  It felt fucking great.  Last time I was at the Vogue was when I was running the Comedy Festival and I was downstairs in the dressing room trying to get a certain Canadian comedy star on stage.  She was a bit of a handful to say the least and I really didn't know if she was going to get up there.  So this was a really nice...hm...what's the word...revenge isn't right...I don't know what word I want but it was great to be there and be performing myself instead of managing someone else and to do a great job.  I'm way grateful for that opportunity too.  Blessed?  You bet.

And now?

My shows are over.  I'm just going to focus on teaching and getting SketchFest going (I'm so behind).  I'm going to hang out with my fabulous girlfriend and my beautiful cats and my wonderful friends.  I'm going to sleep and organize my house and shower in my bathroom with my fetching new pink shower curtain and be a normal person for a while.  Well, okay, probably not the last part...

And.  I'm going to.  Try.  To.  Write.  I'm terrified.  I haven't written any sketch in years now.  And I'm afraid I can't do it anymore.  I'm afraid nothing will be as good as what I've got.  But I'm going to try.  Because I've found where I want to be and I don't want to lose it.  But I can't do this show forever so I need to write some new stuff.  I need to get out there and perform again and try out new stuff.  EEK!  But I'm hopeful.  And proud of myself.  And happy.  Jesus.  I'm happy.  Wow.  Cool.

But for now, I'm going to fill my coffee cup again and wait for the veggie mousaka that Jack just made to be cooked and drink some wine and tonight...SUPER GIRLS WRESTLING!  Woo hoo!  I've never been and I'm so excited.  Wrasslin'!

Much love to you all. Take care.  For those of you feeling abandoned by me, let's reconnect.  Okay?  Okay.  Yippee!

"event","Lots to update on but I can only really seem to think of one thing today.  However, in a nutshell...

Pride was great.  The Dyke March was fun and people said I did a good hosting job.  Jack was here with me and it was fun to hang out and enjoy each other and friends.  Got to meet some of her friends from Seattle.  It was my little friend's first Pride as a gaylord.  Warmed my little maternal heart to be a part of that. The Odd Ball was AMAZING and people keep saying it was the best Pride event ever.  So fun.  Check out www.theoddballcouver.blogspot.com  

Jack is amazing.  I don't understand this feeling so comfortable and safe and relaxed business.  I don't understand this healthy relationship nonsense.  But I'm getting quite attached to it all.  I think I'll keep her.  For a very long time, I hope.

But the world feels like a very crazy place right now.  I have all these wonderful things in my life but they keep getting knocked out of view by something else.  Okay.  Here goes.  My friend Dawn killed herself on Tuesday.  She's dead.  Dawn is dead.  Jesus.  I keep trying to write those words and read them and reread them to make this more real but it just doesn't work.  I have her picture here on my desk to try and make it more real but it's as though my brain doesn't have the capability to comprehend.  I mean, it just can't be.

I haven't shed a single tear yet.  I'm completely and utterly in shock and denial.  This just can't be.  She is the person in my life who would win the 'least likely to ever commit suicide' title.  I guess not.  I keep seeing her everywhere now, or thinking I do.  And I am realizing now how many things about myself are rooted in my friendship with her.  She was one of my best friends during a very pivotal time in my life, during my mid-late twenties, and as I move through the world this week I keep noticing things about myself that I learned from, or took from her.  Things like her ability to talk to anyone, anywhere.  In line at the supermarket making jokes with the other people waiting, neighbours over the fence, complete strangers sitting beside her at a play.  This is something I do now too--something I cultivated because I admired it so much in her, this ability to treat everyone the same, to enjoy strangers and treat them as equals not as someone to be intimidated by, this open-ness.  Things like her home decorating, her making of a home for her family, her creation of a place that friends and family could gather.  Walking through Mole Hill with Jack last night, looking at the beautiful houses, we stopped at one particularly special one with a garden and a walk and a yard and I stood there longing for that kind of grown-up, grounded home.  And I thought of Dawn and how that is what she made for her daughter and her husband and herself and what she welcomed us all into.  Most of all, Dawn gave me faith in love.  She married my best friend Tony and changed my mind about love.  Before that, I had given up because all I knew of love at that time and from my family was cheating and lies.  And, well, Tony and I were rare birds, an acquired taste, if you will.  We would drink Guinness and eat chicken wings together every Wednesday night.  We would call each other at 3 in the morning and watch Flowbie commercials together over the phone.  We were probably going to be single forever.  I always hated all Tony's girlfriends and used to pick fights with them all the time.  No one was ever good enough for my wonderful friend as far as I was concerned.  And he would always get pissed at me for stooping to date the guys I dated.  And I would get so mad at him.  He got to date the stupidest, flakiest, meanest women but I had to have standards?!  We would argue about that all the time.  And then came Dawn.  The night I met her (he brought her to one of our Wing Wednesdays) I fell right in love with her too.  She went to the bathroom at one point and I looked at him across the table and said, ""If you don't marry her, you are the stupidest man ever.""  He did.  And they were so in love.  Their relationship taught me that, not only could someone like me or Tony find love, but we could even find our soul mates.  Tony had.  I have never known any two people more perfect for each other or more in love.  

So, what do you do when the person who made you believe in love kills themselves?  You get very confused, I tell you what.  You wonder if falling in love is a very good idea at all.  You get very scared about all your other friends and want to call them up and make sure they're okay.  The sad ones, yes, but especially the happy ones.  You feel a lot of guilt about being such a friend-lose-track-of-er.  You wish you could hit rewind.  This just can't be.  It just can't.  I don't even know how to deal with this. 

I can't imagine what Tony is going through right now.  He told me ""time just isn't moving at all"".  I bet.  And her 19 year old daughter.  Jesus.  She was the absolute best parent, her daughter's best friend.  I don't understand this.  I'm so confused.  

It's weird because whenever anyone dies, people are always saying how special they were and how unique and amazing and I always think, yeah, yeah.  Sure, everyone's special.  But I always believe that people are just thinking about all the wonderful parts of someone after they die and sort of idolizing them in a way that may not be very accurate.  But Dawn WAS amazing and unique and so vibrant and special.  Had she died after a long battle with cancer or been murdered she would be one of those people they make TV movies about or write long articles in the paper on.  How can it be that such a person would take her life?

I feel very crazy.  As someone who lives with clinical depression and wouldn't be alive today without my medication, who has contemplated suicide many a time, I understand.  And I hate when people say to me, ""You don't seem depressed!"" or stupid things like that.  And yet, somehow, she didn't seem depressed.  And I think about how dead she must have felt inside to do this and I wish someone had known and had helped her.  And I feel pissed that, in true Dawn do-everything-so-well-and-thoroughly fashion, she didn't fail in her attempt.  Maybe that would have allowed her to get some help.  But that wouldn't have been her style.  And for that, I'm pissed as all get out at her.  I don't feel angry at her like people sometimes do when someone kills themselves and leaves behind people who love them.  How people see suicide as selfish.  I know it's not that at all.  I just feel so very sad that she got to that place.  I feel so sad that she couldn't ask for help.  I have never felt that close to going through with suicide, I've always been able to say to at least one person, I don't think I'm okay right now.  I can't imagine how bad she felt that she was unable to do that.  I'm so sorry, Dawn.  I wish I could have known.

The world feels a very crazy place right now.  I don't think I understand this at all."

DYKE MARCH
I will be hosting the Dyke March again this year.  As usual, I won't actually be marching.  I'll be the sitting on the stage looking pretty, greeting you all when you arrive.  Should be good times.  I promise not to call anyone by the wrong name or gender this year!  Oy...

PRIDE PARADE
Who is around?  Who wants to watch together?  I'm not going to march with any contingent this year.  I just want to hang out on the sidelines and enjoy.  Yippee!  Join me?

THE ODD BALL
My dear friends Zena, Brie, Amber Dawn, Michael and I are throwing the best pride party!  You must come.  It's going to be so fun.

Michael and I are doing something in bunny outfits to Magnetic Fields ""Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits"" and Michael, Brie and I are doing a cheerleeding number to Toni Basil ""Micky"" but I'm going to do something else too, I think.  I said I was going to do something strippy yesterday.  Perhaps I will.

And for all of you who haven't met my new beau yet, she will be here again for pride so you can check, check, check it out!

<P>Oh, I know, you've been simply lost without me!&nbsp; Thank God you have Jason's epic bike &amp; bake posts to read or you'd be thoroughly despondent, I'm sure.&nbsp; Okay, on with the update...</P>
<P>I am good.</P>
<P>My birthday was awesome this year.&nbsp; Even though me and Aaron got way too drunk on my birthday, we had a lovely relaxing night just hanging out at my house.&nbsp; I cooked (I KNOW!) delicious pasta from the First Ravioli Store on the Drive and we watched my Sean Cullen tape.&nbsp; Life doesn't get much better than gin &amp; tonics, smoked gouda pasta in cream sauce and laughing at the funniest man on the planet with my dear friend.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also celebrated on the day before my birthday with Zenipants and Aaron at Foundation then went to the Anza Club and met Rachel and Dave and the ever-hilarious Aeysha for some music.&nbsp; My birthday during the day was spent at the Stonewall celebration in the park with Michael and Zena &amp; Aaron and visits with other lovely friends.&nbsp; Went by Tara's place after that to make it a full East End Extravaganza.&nbsp; </P>
<P>AND I celebrated the day after with a delicious brunch at lisa &amp; Cheryl's abode with the world's greatest dog, Joe.&nbsp; Then off to Amber Dawn's fundraiser at Celebrities which was awesome.</P>
<P>Now, I know at this point you're saying to yourself, but Morgan!&nbsp; That is more than you've gone out all year!&nbsp; And to that I say, I KNOW!&nbsp; It was great and fun and totally relaxed but then I had to stay in my house for the rest of the week like the good little agoraphobe I am.</P>
<P>The only things missing from my kickass birthday weekend were my beloved Fancy and my dear friends Jason, Alison and Sean Le Bon.&nbsp; Oh, and I just celebrated with Vern this week!&nbsp; I am well and thoroughly birthdayed and very officially 35.</P>
<P>The best part about turning 35 you ask?&nbsp; Well, you're just full of comments and questions today, aren't you?&nbsp; The very best part of turning 35 is that...SANTA BROUGHT ME A NEW DADDY FOR MY BIRTHDAY!&nbsp; YIPPEE!</P>

<P>Yes, it's true.&nbsp; I am officially the luckiest 35 year old you know.&nbsp; She is so good to me it's stupid.&nbsp; I keep trying to talk him out of it but it doesn't seem to be working so I think I'll stop and just enjoy it.&nbsp; And I will stop talking about this now as I am on the verge of using an emoticon and then you would have to kill me.</P>
<P>In other news...</P>
<P>I will be doing my one-femme show Girls Like Me at the Vancouver Fringe Festival.&nbsp; It will be a Pink Vixen Comedy Arts-produced double bill with Assaulted Fish, Vancouver's kick-ass sketch comedy troupe, at 7:30 and yours truly at 9.</P>
<P>I will also be directing Melinda Gidaly Mayor's hilarious one-woman show Jew! (A Musical).&nbsp; It's funny and sweet and lovely and I can't wait for you all to see it.</P>
<P>And in still other news...</P>
<P>I just got a small but hysterical role on a TV pilot called Three Moons Over Milford.&nbsp; It's a truly great, funny, biting, dark and fucking kickass script and I am so stoked to be part of it.&nbsp; And no, this isn't just the endorphins from finally getting laid talking, it's really a great script.&nbsp; And the director and producers are lovely and funny.&nbsp; It's kind of like Malcolm in the Middle...Picket Fences meets Six Feet Under.&nbsp; Anyhow, I'm praying that it goes to series because a) it's great, and, b) my part is a recurring one!&nbsp; Oh please, oh please, oh please...</P>
<P>And that is about all that there is to tell you and probably much more than you wanted to know.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Except Frick is all better, it would seem, and back to being his sucky baby mama's boy self.&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise be to Whoopi.</P>
<P>Thanks to everyone for your birthday wishes and gifties and all around loveliness.&nbsp; I am lucky to have such nice peeps as y'all.</P>

Britney's Disney birth
BANG
June 20, 2005


(BANG) - Pop babe Britney Spears will reportedly give birth listening to Disney tunes. 

The 23-year-old 'Toxic' singer - who starred on the Disney Channel's 'Mickey Mouse Club' show as a child - is said to have chosen her favourite songs from 'The Princess Collection' to help her cope with labour. 

The sexy star, who has reportedly battled terrible morning sickness and temperamental mood swings during her pregnancy, is due to give birth to her first child later this year. 

Meanwhile, the 23-year-old's husband, Kevin Federline, has made a tearful tribute to Britney. 

To a backing soundtrack, the former dancer gave a weepy performance during the finale of their reality show, 'Kevin and Britney: Chaotic', telling the singer: ""I wanted to put this together just to kind of show you, baby, how much I care. I love you more than life and I'd do anything for you."" 

He added: ""She's my angel, everything I've ever wanted in life, in a person, in a human being. Her soul is caring. She's just a giving person. You don't see everybody like that. The most wonderful things have happened to me with her and I can't see myself with anybody else. I love her more than anything."""

"event","So, the vet called today and said that Frick's tests showed no crystals or bacteria.  This is apparently good news.  So, since there's so much blood in his urine, something is wrong.  It could be stones (which would be bad news) but they're thinking it is interstitial cystitis which is an inflammation of the bladder lining.  They don't know what causes this, whether it's viral or bacterial or stress related.  Um...how is a cat's life stressful?  I should be so stressed!

So, it can sometimes resolve itself on its own but the course of treatment she recommends is...wait for it...you're not going to believe this...oh, but it's true...a tricyclic antidepressant!  People!  My cat is now on antidepressants!  Which means that the only one in our house not on medication for some kind of mental health issue is Kismet.  Those of you who know Kismet, please try and pick yourselves up off the floor where you are no doubt lying doubled up with laughter and the hysterical irony of this situation.  For those of you who don't know Kismet, suffice it to say that she is a fucking nutter of the highest order.  Seriously.  Fully, completely, utterly nuts.

So, Frick had his first dose tonight.  The hope is that this will decrease the inflammation and help with the terrible stress of Frick's ever so intense life.  Fucking drama queen cat.  If this is going to help we will see results within about a week or so.  If it doesn't help, he will have to be X-rayed to see if it's bladder stones.  I sure hope this works.  

He also has to go on a special diet because he is ""overweight"".  But that is a hysterical story for another day so you'll have to stay tuned for more thrilling adventures in Frick's urinary tract.  For now, enjoy this silly picture of him enjoying sitting in a cardboard box.  

Thanks again for all the support, peeps.  I appreciate you all very much."

"event","My cat Frick (handsomely pictured) is sick.  He has some kind of urinary tract problem.  I am losing my mind.  I just took him to the vet and the good news is that he isn't blocked.  That would have necessitated a catheter and other horribleness and about $800.  But they had to keep him over night to get a urine sample and such.  I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.  The vet promised that if they could do what they need to do today she would call me and I could go get him today.  

I'm so worried about my Papa Bear.  I was up with him all night.  He just kept walking around the house crying and looking at me like he wanted me to help him.  It nearly killed me.  

I also can't afford this.  I just spent the last of my money to take him to the vet and now it's going to be more money for medicine and special food for him.  I may have to hold a Free Frick fundraiser.  Andrea, your magic number 8 in my wallet better do its stuff!  I'm saying my money affirmations like crazy.

This is another reason why I don't think I should have kids.  I'm losing my mind here.  How on earth would I cope if my child got sick and had to go to the hospital?  Or, God forbid, got shot by some hostage-taking fucker.  I can't even wrap my head around that whole situation.  So, so terrible.

Okay, I'm feeling crazy and rambling now.  Please say prayers or whatever you do in your world for my baby.  I'm going to try and take a nap and hope that I wake up to a phone call from the vet saying everything is fine and my boy has made a miraculous recovery and I can go fetch him and bring him home and cuddle him and kiss him and rub his little white tummy."

"event","I have just returned from what I hope will be my new career; professional taste tester.  I signed up with this market research company to do focus groups and such.  I figure I might as well get paid for expressing my damn opinion all the time.  

They called me at about 7:30 sounding a bit frantic.  They needed people who regularly drink soy beverages to take part in a taste test at 8.  I'm not surprised they were short on folks.  They can put a robot thing on Mars but they can't make soy products that don't taste like ass?  Anyhow, being the soy-milk-in-my-cereal kind of girl that I am, I qualified for their test with flying colours and headed down to sit in a room with a bunch of other women (Why only women?  I do not know.) to taste 3 different types of soy chocolate beverage and circle whether I found it to have no aftertaste, pleasing aftertaste, unpleasing aftertaste and the like.  Well, I had a lot to say about those soy beverages I tell you and wrote notes in the margins and below the questions etc.!  I'm sure they will be very grateful for my input.  Soy drinkers of the world, hang in there!  Better chocolate soy beverages are on their way, thanks to me.  You're welcome.

I received one very crisp and shiny new twenty dollar bill and one very crisp and shiny new ten dollar bill--that's right people, the new ones with the fancy business on them!--in an envelope for about 15 minutes of my time.  And I got a nice walk in the sun in my beautiful neighbourhood which I wouldn't have done otherwise.  (You can't put a price on exercise, I always say.)

I am scheduled to take part in a focus group regarding meat alternatives on June 28th for which I will received $60.  I'm making money while I eat!  If I could just get someone to pay me to watch TV I'd give up the whole performing/producing thing.  Heaven.  That would be heaven.    

I think I'm really good at this.  I think I may have finally found my calling.  I think...I think...I may finally have my way home."

""There's an awfully big difference between being 'nice' and being 'kind.' Usually being 'nice' involves saying yes to a whole bunch of stuff you don't actually want to do in order to get everyone to like you. Being kind, on the other hand, usually involves thinking independently and about the long term, and saying 'no' to something when you know it's just going to mean more fuss and trouble in the future. So which would you rather be? Nice or kind? The choice is up to you.""

As you know, I have only 3 or 4 channels (depending on the day) and most of them are fuzzy.  So I'm watching whatever I can get to come in that's not sports which means some weird show looking back to the music and gossip of the 90s.  Did you know that Toni Braxton had a strict religious upbringing and was not allowed to wear pants? 

Last night I realized yet another reason to have a boyfriend; so you have someone to go to the store for you when you're sick.  Then I thought that, if you had one who was really sweet, s/he would probably go to the store for you even if you weren't sick.  Then I felt even more sorry for myself.  Whatever.  I don't even give a care.

The part where he sings ""My heart is down, my head is turning around, I had to leave a little girl in Kingstontown"".  I thought he'd left a small child all by herself in this Kingstontown place and I used to imagine her in a pretty little dress with curls in her hair, walking around town crying and alone with no one to look after her.

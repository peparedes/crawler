so we're working towards july 14 for our EP launch, and have a gig two days after that aswell!! :)

i have a massive list of peeps im guna send the cd out to (ones who obviously can't make one'v our shows and buy it for themselves!), so in about a months time it'll be out there!! woohoo!! oh, then we get the multi - thousand dollar bill to pay for it all.. :(  but hey it'll definately be worth it! 

we did a photo shoot on wed for the back cover and the pics came out great!! we got them taken where we jam, which is in a warehousey thing, so the background looks awesome.. theyr all black n whites. 

we've also ordered wireless receivers, so no more leads and heaps more movin and jumpin round on stage!! :) this band is costing me so much money!! but hey it's better than spending it on a girl that doesn't appreciate it! or you for that fact! (maybe shoulda left that out :S hehe)

so yeh, that's life for me at the mo.. 

mums big work exhibition has finally come round, so all the fams in town this weekend and next week, its guna be awesome!!

for the last couple of weeks i've been working the holiday program as well as working my normal jobs and going to uni, and seeing elle in between here and there.. 

last weekend the band finished all instruements and about half vocals, so there's about a day recording left. everythings sounding awesome at the moment, we can't wait to hear the final mixed and mastered product!! last saturday was tones of fun coz once bits and pieces on guitars were finished up out singer Tim had the hard work to do and the rest of us just drank lots of beer!! hehe then helped out on some group singing and 'chants' which were soo much fun after a few coronas :) twas heaps funny!

me and elle did this cool job together in the city last wednesday. it's a market research thing where we try a product and answer questions and stuff and make some cash out'v it! we have to pretend that we don't know each other for the job though hehe hopefully more come up soon, the only downer was that some guy in the city hit elle from behind on our way in. nothing major, twas his fault so his insurance has to pay and there wasn't much damage but at the time it felt really bad

on saturday, me and elle and lotsa ppl from geelongs are going to some dinner dance in the city. weve booked a big table and it sounds like its guna be a ton-a-fun! free beer and wine is included! how good! :) just hope i don't have to drive! 

theres prolly tonnes more i could talk about but i have to get ready for the meeting and stuff, but i'll try my best to post regularly"

the day her parents left back for Perth was sad.. they were all trying to be so calm and everything about the move but it was just a matter of time before the emotions came out

Elle seems to be settling in heaps well in Geelong and with her new house mate Sarah. i think she thinks she's on holiday..she doesn't stop shopping!! haha

We (Burgworth) have a gig not this saturday, but next with a local but recognised band called Armageddon Sky, which should be fun. Our EP will be done soon also, and were setting a gig to launch that in April!! guna be awesome!! 

anyone who wants a copy of the CD, just ask and i'll happily post it out!!"

duno if anyone read my post on smells, and how they bring back memories?? well, the other day i was with a friend looking for presents for his girlfriend.. we went into a pharmacy and were trying perfume samples, so i got the assistant to give me a 'ralph lauren romance' one (which elima wears of course).. and OH MY GOODNESS! my heart almost stopped and i got chills all over my body!! its was crazy!! so now i keep it in my wallet next to a picture of her and get a high off it all the time! hehe

for example.. 

elima bought my some boss cologne about a year ago, but i didn't wear it until i visited her one time. i was staying at her uncle barry's. every morning i would get up, have a shower, put this cologne on and wait for her to come and pick me up. now everytime i put it on i get these crazy flashback feelings of excitedly waiting her for to come, and seeing her come in the door every morning. its really strange.. but good! :)

We're doing three songs, two of them new, which is good coz i've been able to have heaps of input into them!

We just did drums yesterday. it's surprising how long it takes to set it all up, get the sound you want and then actually record the tracks! But the drums sounded rad, we were all really pleased. 

bass is being done today.. guitars and vocals next weekend..

it should come out sounding very professional, i'll make sure everyone gets a copy of it!!

"event","Two years ago today was my cousin Karls wedding.. (i wrote most of this two days ago, 24/01 so yeh.. 2 years ago then actually!)

It was my first time to Perth, i had no money left after a 6 week holiday to Sydney and the Gold Coast. I was baptised at the Sydeny International Convention so i was starting a ""new life"" as it was, but had no idea what was just about to hit me..

we arrived in Perth on Monday the 19th Jan 2004 (or it could have been the sunday). On our first day me and my cousin Derek decided to take a walk around Perth city. there wasn't much to see.. we were looking for things to do to pass time before Karl's wedding that Saturday and on Tuesday made a last minute decision to visit Karl's congregation that night and meet some locals. we asked the rest of the boys staying with us to come but they didn't want to, so we stirred them up saying that we were guna meet some girls that would drive us around for the rest of the week. little did we or they know! hehe 

Karl dropped us off and as we walked towards the hall i spotted a lil black honda civic with L-plates parked in the first congregation park spot. 

*note to self, find the 16 - 18 year-old girl who drives the honda. first here, must be part of a good family!* 

As we walked into the hall, Derek in jeans and a t-shirt, and my hair uncut for the longest time, but in a suite at least, I spot someone over to my right near the literature counter wearing a black dress but get distracted by a greeting from a local elder, probably thinking we were worldly! lol

The elders name was Glen. After introducing ourselves, the elders' wife Merlene also introduced herself and we briefly talked about where we were from and our families etc. what a small world! Derek who? Mathew who? we found out that Glen and Merlene knew my parents and dereks parents from living in the islands. how weird! as we were chatting, Merlene snuck off and re-appeared again with the girl wearing the black dress who i spotted when i came in. it was her daughter Elima, we shook hands and introduced each other. Pretty much my first question was ""do you drive the honda civic?!"" hehe what a guess!! my first thought of Elima was ""hmm, she looks a little young but we'll see.."" we didn't get to talk for too long, but i found out that she was 17, not 16 as i'd first thought, that was a relief! and that she was going to uni doing computer science starting in a few months. 

*mental note, she's on holidays!! :)* 

and to this day she reminds me of a question i asked her, i said ""where do you get your complexion from?"" is that such a dumb question? or did i just word it weirdly? coz she was all tanned up and looking at her parents i wondered how she was so brown.. anyway.. the meeting was just about to start.. i must have said her name 100 times in my head during the meeting to make sure i remembered it for afterwards!! hehe

after the meeting Elima nervously started an introduction spree!! lol she even ended up shaking my hand again as i introduced myself to Sarah. They were standing next to each other and i was like ""Hi im Mat"" to Sarah and stuck my hand out, and Elima shook it again! haha. After we met a few ppl, Elima started getting a group together to go out for coffee after the meeting. we got a ride with Lawerence.. thanks alot elle! :P 

We went to the lava lounge (i think).. there was about 8 of us and some others from stirling met us there too. after talking for a while, we mentioned that we were bored and looking for things to do that week, and organised to go to the beach with Elima the next day. 

*mental note ""woohoo!""* 

the only thing i really recall from that night at the lava lounge was making some comment about phones or Elima's phone, i can't rememeber exactly.. but i remember her putting her phone on the table infront of me and sitting back casually. I picked it up and said ""nice phone"" and put it back down, knowing what she'd put it there for me to do, but pretending not to know and giving her a bit of a cheek at the same time.. and then 'suddenly realising' what she wanted me to do after exchanging a funny look with her.. hehe

So there it all began! The other boys wouldn't believe that we'd found someone to hang out with. especially when we told them it was a cute 17 yr-old girl and we were going with her to the beach the next day! :)

that week was great.. Elima always says that i didn't even show i liked her while i was there, but i disagree. i guess we were both a bit sceptical of each other to start with..

the day i was leaving Perth she made an effort to come and see me and the others, and with basically no money to my name, used my last couple of bucks to email her from a public internet pc at the airport. the rest is a long long story..


Elima was the first girl that i had ever met and just clicked with immediately.. there was something so special about her that i had to be apart of. i can still remember the first time i saw her and met her like it was yesterday.. so friendly, so genuine, so really really ridiculously good looking! :) hehe

2 years from then and all thats changed is my love for her.. i now know that she's the one for me, the one i want to be with forever.. 

i just hope i'm the one she wants to be with aswell.."

"event","its funny how everything can come crashing down for seemingly no reason at all.. 

but once everything settles down and you sort yourself out, it can be for the best..

having your girlfriend break up with you, your best friend and crucial band member decide he's moving interstate and your car brake down all in the same week isn't very fun.. 

all this a few weeks before your end of year uni exams which means you don't get to concentrate on study properly, along with not much sleep, no appetite and pretty much no will to live.. (ok maybe going a bit too far there hehe)

when i used to hear of people having depression, especially people in the truth, i'd think to myself, why? you've got the truth, you're alive and healthy.. whats ur problem? spose i hadn't felt the sorta pressure this world has the potential to put on you

2 months felt like 2 years, and everyday was the same.. endless questioning, constant thinking, never-ending pain

the outcome??

Me and Elima are back together, i spent a week over in perth with her and she came here for a week (a few weeks back, twas awesome!!).. and she's even moving over to live in Geelong in 1 months time!!! 1 month!! i can't believe it!!! :) :)

I just joined a new band called Burgworth and my first gig with them is supporting Lagwagon, how good!!!

Cars are fixable and im getting another one which although not as cool, won't give me any expensive problems to worry about! (no car will ever be cooler than my Beema, EVER!!)

I passed all of my exams, one very marginly, but hey, our saying at Deakin is ""P's equals degrees""!! lol


so apart from the most of the last 3 months being absolute hell, its been a huge learning curve in my life which i am already appreciating. it has taught me to rely on Jehovah more, to find who my true friends are, and most importantly to never get stuck in a rut in a relationship with someone you truly love.. even though its nice to be in love and to think they'll always be there, every part of your life has to revolve around that person or you're not being genuine enough to be in a relationship heading towards marriage.. all the feelings were there but i hadn't been showing it enough.. that will NEVER happen again..

p.s. thanx again for the nudge Caris ;)"

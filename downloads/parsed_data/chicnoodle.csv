I don't want to do anything but prepare for baby.  :)  Good thing there's only this week and next week left in the school year!   All month, we've been learning Bible verses about perseverance and resisting temptation, and all I want to do is tap out!  I better take the advice of my own Bible lessons and keep on keepin on."

"event","Of course, I wake up at 4:45 on a day like to day, to actually be awake and ready to answer when the phone rings, announcing the snow day.  Of course I'm more productive and energetic today of all days this week!  I could have probably used this snow day earlier this week, when my fever was running about 101 and we were in the middle of a field trip up to Flint.  But it's kind of nice to have this healthy, happy day off, now that I've trudged through the drudgery of working through being sick.  And since I'm awake with all this momentum, papers will be graded, dishes will be washed, laundry will be done, baby's room will be prepped for painting, and Doug and I are going to the movies!  

Good timing, Snow Day. I approve."

"event","In my ladies' weekly Bible study group, we make goals each year and help keep each other accountable throughout the year.  I've been putting some thought into mine for this year already, as last year mine were simple and achievable.  I'm ready for more discipline this year.  

Last year's goals: 
-Have surgery to repair hernia.  
-Buy a house. 

Both achieved!  

This year's goals:
-Walk 30 minutes three times a week.  
-Keep up with Bible Study homework.  
-Start saving for retirement.  
-Decorate the nunnery for baby.  

Yep.  2013 is a year of big changes. 

Since baby's coming, Doug might be taking on another part-time teaching job: elementary computers.  That would mean he'd teach EVERY grade k-12.  It'll be great for recruiting for his band program!  Baby also means that I'm postponing grad school till later.  It's not really do-able on my private school salary anyway, nor is it necessary.  In time!"

She was reading everything with good fluency and expression until she came to the word ""boyfriend"" and she balked.  After a pause, she ventured, ""...friend?""  My girl thought ""boyfriend"" was an inappropriate word for school and didn't want to say it in front of her teacher.  My heart just melted!  I let her know that it's ok to say ""boyfriend.""

one of my 3rd graders arrived in the classroom and took off his coat.  Then he suddenly realized that he forgot to put on his uniform shirt and only had on an undershirt.  

HAHAHAHA!

It was one of those days, I guess!  He just got to wear his undershirt all day.  That's one of those times when it is really hard not to just laugh right at him, but laughing would help NOTHING!  His mom was even volunteering at our school today.  She was more than a little embarrassed!

1. Got our new Macbook Pro yesterday.  The fun has begun.

2. AT&T upgraded our internet to almost 3x faster at no extra cost.  They're coming to replace our modem tomorrow.  For free!

3. I got to save Doug's day with some quick thinking and tech-saviness, which I don't have much of, so it's worth celebrating. 

4. My shifts at Sylvan were 3 hrs and 3 hrs instead of 4 hrs and 2 hrs.  3& 3 is a whole lot easier to deal with.  And on top of that, my students were very peppy and cooperative.  Yay!

5. Presents came in the mail from my parents.  I love that they love presents as much as me.  Call me cheesy, but I love greeting cards, too, and today I got both.  

6. Doug made steak, baked potatoes, and salad for dinner.  Can this day get any better??

7. My principal sent me my specials schedule and my CLASS LIST!  I have 18 sweet little third graders in my class.  Just 18.  I'm in heaven.  I'm in love.  I'm so excited.  

8. Grocery shopping night!  Fresh cereal to stock the cupboards is good enough to make anybody's day. 

9.  The episode of Community with Lavar Burton, which is the best, is on right now.

10. Tomorrow's going to be just as awesome!  Jeans day + new modem + roadtrip to Kzoo with my sweetheart."

1. Grandma Himes is pretty easy to please and very FUN to please.  Doug gave me a trip to Florida as my Christmas gift this year.  We stayed with Grandma and Grandpa, just relaxing and enjoying warm sunny weather (as opposed to the cold snowy weather we have here at home).  We went to the zoo, to church, to the mall, just doing regular summer-type stuff.  Nothing extravagant!  But since Doug replaced the filter on their faucet, they are sooooo happy with us and have sent us letters, emails, and phone messages telling us we're welcome back any time.  :) They're awesome!

2. Sylvan awarded me Teacher of the Month for February!  :)  Sylvan is such a friendly, nice place to work.  I get soooo tired by the end of a 12 hr day, but I love Sylvan!

3. Chris Shay asked Doug and me to lead a team to Zimbabwe.  They're about to have elections in Zimbabwe again, so things are liable to get unstable over there again.  If we do it, there's a big chance we won't actually go because of the political climate.  We would both love to go, but right now we're being careful about thinking things through and praying about it. 

4. Doug's parents finally got the house they put a bid in for way back in October.  Except now that his mom's leg is broken, she can't move in.  She can't drive, so she has to stay at her mom's house so her mom can drive her to work every morning, and that's pretty much driving her crazy.  :)  I'm going over today to wash out cupboards and do other miscellaneous chores that she's not able to do because of her busted leg.  Poor Leslie! It's a great house though.  It was built in 1961.  They bought it from the original owners, meaning there are quiet a few retro design aspects throughout the house!  haha  Plus, it's in the same neighborhood as Uncle Dave, which is good. 

5. My long-term sub position starts Monday!  Finally, I get to go to work at the same building every day! woo hoo!"

I have a few ""picked out"" for when I'm hired and when Doug's not a poor grad student.  :) I'm looking for a house less than $150,000 in a nice area that has 2 bathrooms and curb appeal. 

I like <a href=""http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1619-E-Maple-Rd-Birmingham-MI-48009/24531713_zpid/#image=imgId%3DX1-IAmxnw4ipt9bbl_eh4v4"">this one in Birmingham</a>.

Anyway, it's fun.  :) I consider it ""research""."

He looked older and broader, but was just as nice and well-spoken as expected. 

2. My BMI is too low for a free three week membership at FitZone.  They let me work out for half an hour anyway.  Bummer!  haha

3.  Today I applied to be the secretary to the superintendent of Royal Oak schools.  Major Monty is buddy-buddy with said superintendent and gave him a call to recommend me this morning.  Maybe I can get into a classroom through the side door?? 

4.  Doug is still gone.  *sigh*  But the Coakley's are giving me a ride there, Dawn Crowell is letting me stay in her room, and Donna gave me the day off.  It's only costing me a day's pay.  :) Yes!! I'll get to finally see Doug!

5.  I somehow have to move everything in my apartment at least three feet away from the heating vents before Friday, thanks to a demand from Maintenance.  They're apparently doing some assessments.  If I move my couch 3 ft away from the heating vent, it will be against the other wall.  This apartment is too small for demands like that, maintenance people!

6.  Today I found $15 in my car, so I got myself Arby's for dinner and then they gave me the wrong change but I didn't realize it until after I had left and thrown the receipt away.  Arby's, you owe me $2!!!"

And speaking of pickles, here's one for you guys to figure out.  When should Doug and I get married?  

He very much wants to get married.  I very much want to get married.  He was feeling like since he postponed the wedding, it might be too soon to get married (after all, what was the postponement for anyway?) but now he's feeling differently about that.  I would like to actually have the wedding that I planned, not just a mini-wedding just to get it done.  I want to do it right and proper because it's a significant event!  Do we have to wait until spring for that to happen?  Do I want my anniversary to be so close to Christmas and my birthday?  Does that really even matter?  When is the corps available?  When are all the guests available?

After jumping through an unreasonably large number of hoops to be a sub, I had a half day for a 3/4 grade class on Thursday, and yesterday I was a high school math teacher.  I thought it'd be scary to teach high school: teenagers are so manipulative and sneaky sometimes!  Plus I thought everybody would think I was a student or wouldn't respect me as a teacher.  The kids in Rochester are good though!   It was fun.  It's great to be a sub and only have to teach the easy lessons.  I like switching identities, too.  One day I teach third grade, the next I'm teaching geometry to 10th graders.  :D  

Other good news: I have jobs lined up for Monday and Tuesday, too.  I'm making sure to differentiate where I work at first, so I have lots of options in terms of who knows me and wants to ask me to sub.  THen, once I've taken a pretty good sampling, I'll focus on one district and then one school.

This weekend was all kinds of fun.  It makes me sad that everybody's going to split up and get back in the regular grind, but I'm sure it'd be sad to the be one not going back to the grind.  Like those kids who had the best days of their life in high school and the rest is downhill from there.  Anyway, most everybody is going back to some kind of routine these days.  I hope I get a job so I have a routine to get into...and I know there are others out there in the same boat as me!

Anyway, a quick recap of this weekend...
Friday night: Katy Day--lots of fun with Kalamazoo girls.  I think we could even count it as a Jr. Home League meeting.  There were 11 of us, for whoever is keeping track of stats.  haha

Saturday: fun with Jeanie, grandparents, a flat tire, then over to Sara's for a girls' night

Sunday: church at Royal Oak (which gets better and better), bridal shower for my dear Caitie, brinner at the MieschShack, and some quality time with Doug

Monday: (I love how Monday still counts as my weekend! HA) lunch at DHQ with Doug, Andrew and Derek...helping Sam move into his dorm in East Lansing, and I finished Season 2 of Scrubs

I am really starting to love Scrubs.  :)  And Betsy got me a digital converter so as soon as I buy an antenna, I can get NBC for free.  Network TV is a wonderful thing.  

When I substitute teach this year, I won't have to fear when it comes to finding my way, because I got an old GPS thingie from my aunt and uncle as a hand-me-down.  The security of knowing I won't get lost on the way to work is so reassuring.  Things are going to be ok!"

He sendeth more strength when the labors increase,
To added affliction He addeth His mercy,
To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.

His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,
His power no boundary known unto men,
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
He giveth and giveth and giveth again.

When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
When our strength has failed ere the day is half-done,
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,
Our Father's full giving is only begun.

The church people here in Royal Oak have been really great.  I'm keeping a list of people to pray thanks for since the postponement, and it keeps getting longer and longer even those these people don't really know me.  I'm astounded--and I mean it too because that's a crazy word that doesn't get used much.  

Doug's mom helped me make my apartment really homey.  Ange is giving me money-saving tips and tricks.  Sara might move in with me, which would cut rent in half and give me a splendid roommate: awesome.  Doug's been extra conscientious and caring and helpful.  I've had good times with young adult friends from church...hanging out and staying connected.  

Dave & Lisa's wedding on Saturday was really fun: Dan Bell saved me a seat and we were buddies for the reception.  Doug pulled me out onto the dance floor, very uncharacteristic and romantic.  :) Between the ceremony & the reception, Doug & I hung out with Jaclyn, chatting and discussing the world's problems along the river. 

Sunday's sermon was about wisdom/humility and being careful not to entertain the friends of sin: anger, vengence, pride, foolishness, deception, etc... Captain Monty tied it into marriage (he & Captain Angie had us over on Thursday to talk things over and some of what he said that night was taken a step further in his sermon Sunday), and I felt very much affirmed by God in Doug's decision to postpone the wedding.  It's all for the best.  Sarah/Todd/Harper, Erin/Joel/Ainsley, and Devon & Chrissy went out to lunch with us after.  Did you know that they serve french fries with tacos at DelTaco??  Awesome!  Ainsley and Harper are the cutest babies.  I taught Ainsley to pound fists.  :) 

The whole weekend has been very affirming and comforting.  :) Thanks God.

At my two bridal showers, I received so many lovely gifts for my apartment.  I've used a bunch of them because I've never lived in my own place before and pretty much didn't actually own any stuff you need for daily living.  It's been a great comfort to have those nice things here in my little apartment, far away from home.  

Now that Doug's postponed the wedding, all the wedding etiquette advice I see online tells me that I have to return all my shower gifts and replace those I've used already.  Then they say that it wouldn't be polite to have another shower for me later because I already had a shower.  So I have to give back all these nice things that I actually need and when I do get married, I'm not allowed to have a shower.  It seems like salt in the wound. It seems like a punishment I don't deserve! 

Of course I'm going to do what's polite, but it's going to make my already depressing apartment even sadder.  I didn't even do anything bad.  Why can't I keep my presents until Doug decides he's ready to get married?  It just makes me sad.  He's going to do all the dirty work of returning them.  In the meantime, I guess I have to go to the thrift store for towels and a frying pan, and other essential items like that.  :("

I fall asleep fine, but then I wake up too early in the apartment that was supposed to be our home when we got married and my wedding dress is staring me in the face and I can't help but feel alone, insufficient, and pathetic.  The people here at church are being wonderful: Joe, Dan, Capt. Angie, even Alan and Melanie.  I know I'm not alone.  I know it's not me that caused this because of my insufficiency, and I know I'm not pathetic.  But this whole thing is just so sad and hard to deal with.  I love Doug, and whatever happens, of course it'll all be alright with time, but this sucks."

"event","Since there's a lot to say and I'm pretty bad at saying it in an interesting way, this entry will be brought to you a la bulleted list.  :) 

-Doug started his first real grown-up job today.  So proud!
-We're signing on the apartment June 12, which is so close it's practically now. 
-They tossed in new carpeting for free on accident.  :) 
-My last days at West Middle School...a mere 5.5 left.  At this point it doesn't actually feel like it's about to end but in reality--there's barely any time left!
-Our first BRIDAL SHOWER on Sunday means this whole getting married thing is starting to really happen!  
-I just got the curriculum I'll be using to teach Bible this summer at Royal Oak Day Camp.  It's going to need a buttload of supplementation and I don't know where to start.  One lesson is supposed to last two days and I'm supposed to teach it twice, once to the young kids and once to the older kids.  How will I ever come up with enough activities to keep them engaged and help them actually LEARN??  Help!
-My last day at Crossroads Gap is Friday.  THAT totally snuck up on me!  I can't believe I'm done after one little four hour shift on the kids side.  So anti-climactic.  However, my Gen. Manager says she's working on transferring me to the BabyGap that's right across the street from my apartment.  How sweet would that be??
-Wedding invitations will be in this weekend.  Who's ready for an invitation-assembling party?
-Mom got a Wii Fit for mother's day and I am totally rocking it.  :D
-When I move, I am really going to miss the people here at home.  REALLY really.  I'm not sure how to prepare for it...just waiting till it hits me I guess.  Caitlyn & Courtney, what are you guys doing to live through it?? 
-The photoshoot we had last night was really fun.  :)"

We went shopping at Somerset Mall on Saturday and discovered that MSU was having a pep rally right smack in the middle.  The whole basketball team was there, and the coaches, and they gave free hot dogs and ice cream!  Ka-ching!

Next week we put the money down for our apartment!  This is the only picture I got of the place.  I'm sure I'll get more when I move in next month.  (Yikes only one month left till I move!)

Ok now fast foward to this past weekend: we were at Somerset Mall again (it's really close to our favorite apartment) and they were having this major Christian Dior event at Macy's.  They were giving free makeovers all over the place, so I had a lady do mine as if for the wedding.  It was like a trial of a makeup trial.  haha!  Anyway, the lady was heavier on the makeup than I'm used to (but any makeup is heavier than no makeup, duh) and Doug thought it looked freaky.  BUT, for the pictures, I'm thinking I'll need at least a normal amount of make-up.  Just not as much bronzer as the lady used.  That'll be fine though, because the wedding will be at the end of summer when I'll be a lot tanner.  

We're down to the last 120 days!

"event","Doug and I looked all over the place for the place we'll eventually live in together.  I lost count of how many places we checked out, but it was a lot, and I feel like we're significantly better informed when it comes to rentals and real estate.  For a while there, Doug's parents even considered buying a house themselves to rent to us!  That'd be kinda crazy, but they figure it'd be an investment.  

Anyway, we found tons of places that were in our price range but pretty junky and we found even more places that were very nice but too expensive for our budget.  But finally we found the place that fit our budget, has a perfect location, has just the right amenities for us, and feels plenty homey.  

We're thinking we'll start out with the little 1-bedroom floor plan.  If we find it's too cramped & we have the money for rent, we'll just transfer to one of the 2-bedrooms at the end of our 12-month lease.

I've somehow been able to pick up quite a bit of free furniture so far, too. Awesome!!
So far we've got a <ul type=""square""><li>solid oak bed headboard, footer, and frame</li><li>antique rocking chair :)</li><li>leather recliner (clearly necessary for any REAL man)</li><li>4 wooden folding chairs</li><li>2 painted wooden dressers, one tall, one short</li><li>miscellaneous closet-organizing shelves, like for shoes, bags, etc.</li><li>a huge desk..we'll see if it actually fits!</li><li>2 tv trays.  haha!  :) </li></ul>

We're not sure when we're going to make this place officially ours.  We could grab it up now, while we know there's one available.  But we'll probably wait another month & save one month's rent since we don't actually need it right now.  This is fun.  :)"

"event","Today my mom and I took my dress in to be altered.  We took it to the closest seamstress of those the dress vendor recommended and it turned out to be the mom of one of my friends from high school!  Mom really liked her; she's really talkative and funny and nice, plus she knows what she's doing, which is a definite plus. ;)

She has to shorten all four layers, take in the top, make the bustle, and she even offered to tighten up the veil Mom made so it'll be extra secure on the big day.  What's more surprising is that Mom remembers my friend from high school.  (!!) Cordie (the seamstress) was so nice the whole time...and she even gave us a bit of a discount because we're ""band people"" aka friends of her daughter's from marching band in high school.  haha.  Never thought marching band would ever pay off in ways like this...or any way at all.  XD

"event","I'm really over this whole thing with only getting to hang out with Doug if I drive 2.5 hours to get where he is.  =\  Lame!

I'm also pretty done with working day in and day out.  I'm ready for a fun break--it's a good thing I'm visiting Doug this weekend and next weekend is the first of Spring Break.  GOSH it's been a long time in coming!!  O_O

First dress fitting on Thursday...I really need to get working on my eportfolio if I want to get a job for this fall, but I can't get a vision for it, which makes it hard to get motivated. 

This is what you'd call a regular dose of the blahs.  Oh March 2009.  It's true you've finally brought us spring, but could you bring us April, too?"

"event","Ok today Caitlyn & my bosses loved me.  (how do you say possessives with two people?  I'm always wondering  how to say something belongs to Doug & me.  Like our wedding for instance.  Stuff like, ""Doug and mine's wedding plans are going well.""  It sounds so weird no matter how I write it.  I struggle so bad sometimes.)

Ok so the Gap bosses loved me today because I got two gapcards.  This is seriously a catch-22 and I'll tell you why:  If I don't get gapcards, they get all intense about how we need to get gapcards and they'll give you ""THE TALK"" and make you sign some scary paper if you don't get one single gapcard in a certain number of weeks.  So it's always a relief when you get somebody to apply for a gapcard.  

But then, when I'm doing pretty good with the gapcards, they get really excited about how great I'm doing and they schedule me for all the best times NOT to work: like 12-5 or 1-6 on Saturday and Sunday, and Friday nights.  They want their best gapcard-getters to work the busy times so they get even more gapcards.  (Greedies!) It's great, because the busier you are, the faster the day goes and I always feel more productive and appreciated when it's busy.  But every. weekend.  Come on!  Selling gapcards = selling your weekends. Consider em gone. 

What can you do??? I just have to make sure I ask for at least one weekend off each month in good time, before the time-off slots get filled up.  It takes way more organization than I'd usually prefer to take.  

By the way, you can thank the hope of spring that the weather from this weekend has instilled in me for the hyperactivity of this entry.  That, and a visit from Doug, which always perks me up."

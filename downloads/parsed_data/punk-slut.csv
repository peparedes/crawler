aaron....
wow.. i dont even know what to say to you. lol saving best for last i guess. umm from the moment i saw you i knew that i anted to be in love with you. i know how fucking gay that sounds but its like so true. your such an awesome person, and after we got to know eachother i just thought you were even more awesome. im gonna leave all this mushy gushy shit out because you know how i feel about you and i know how you feel about me, so ill just talk about the funny stuff not personal. stealing that road sign! and of course i was the lookout.. the most important part. skinny and morrisay pissing on your winshield. god that was sick. driving around in your car was always fun. and that one time when i was really drunk and in the woods, and you wanted me at your party! and i talked to your brother and thought it was you. wow. i was so dumb and drunk and stoned. skinny...smelling. all of those adventures you took me on, they were real great. sneeking out of my house. always fun with you and the guys. parking and talking and life and all good stuff. aw remember when you gave me that lighter to walk home with? haha. and i was too stupid to use it. hopefully well have more good times in the future, cuz i dont know whats gonna happen with us, but hopefully its something good because your a great person and i love you to death.

Every thought that I repent,
There's another chip you haven't spent,
And you're cashing them all in,
Where do we begin. To get clean again,
Can we get clean again.
I walk home alone with you, And the mood you're born into,
Sometimes you let me in, And I take it on the chin.
I can't get clean again. I want to know, Can we get clean again,
The God of Wine comes crashing through the headlights of a car that took you farther than you thought you'd ever want to go,
We can't get back again, We can't get back again,
She takes a drink and then she waits,
The alcohol it permeates,
And soon the cells give way, And cancels out the day.
I can't keep it all together,
I know...I can't keep it all together.
And the siren's song that is your madness,
Holds a truth I can't erase, All alone on your face.
Every glamorous sunrise, Throws the planets out of line,
A star sign out of whack, A fraudulent zodiac.
And the God of Wine is crouched down in my room, You let me down, I said it,
Now I'm going down, And you're not even around.
And I said no...
I can't keep it all together,
I know...I can't keep it all together,
And there's a memory of a window, Looking through I see you.
Searching for something, I could never give you,
And there's someone who understands you more than I do.
A sadness I can't erase. All alone on your face.

"event","so yeah i think stealing cigarettes from work isnt such a hot idea anymore. everyones been getting shit for it latley especially jess. so yeah.. tonight me and katie stole our last pack. then like ten minutes later the boss shows up. i got really fuckin nervous so i asked to go home early cuz i 'wasnt feeling well' so i got to leave. im just waiting to get fired. haha. i do everything wrong there. i sell to underage people all the time, steal from there even more, and ya. i really should knock it off. i hope bryan doesent talk to me..
and yeah last night driving around was fun for awhile with josh.. until i asked him what he wanted to do because all we were doing was driving and smoking ciggarettes. and he responds with 'we could have sex' i luughed, and hes like 'im serious' after telling him No, oh probably about five times.. he had the balls to say 'well can i at least go down on you?' wtf.. yeaaah. okay! go for it. not. im like 'i dont have random sex, not my style.' and he says well its not that random. o but were not going out, so it is. he was in a bad mood all night anyways. all he wanted to do was get down my pants. and i thought we were just friends. god i hate some guys. the guys that you think will be there for you and stuff that Dont wanna bang you. ive told him were just friends, but yeah. he doesent want to go along with that for some reason. as we were leaving the pizzeria audrey read him his horiscope and it said something like-- [i was stoned i dont really rememmber] you need to get over this sexual something or another you have for a friend or close one, its not going to happen, so just move on. LOL. yes. the horiscopes agree with me too. sweet. i even brought the stupid fucker to the deli to see aaron. ah yes, but even that didnt shake him off. instead, he acting all boyfriendy, hanging me my purse when i could just move four feet and get it myself, and standing real close. that ticked aaron off i assume, because he would glare at me from time to time, and acted like we were friends. i blame it all on josh, obviously. but everyone asked me why the fuck did you bring josh, another guy, to aarons work? yes i dont know either. stupid stupid me.
so that was my last night. and i almost got killed because i was driving stoned. NEVER DRIVE STONED STONERS!!!! youll die. i thought the road was clear so i was taking and left and BOOM there was a car. we didnt hit but jeez. that scared me and ive been pretty scared while driving ever sense, stoned or staright. im such a dumb driver. maybe im still scared about driving when i hit that huge cement thing while parking. lol aaron.. 'okay.. this is the gas, and this is the break..!' yeah well at least i didnt roll my car three times by 'dodging a deer' doofus."

lady in a blue dress...
senses fail...

Just like the lady in the blue dress,
You've got cigarettes on your breath,
Hairspray and some cheap perfume
I'll put a little sour in your sweet.
You've got so much fucking tongue in cheek
You want what you could never have

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
Cause all that I see right now,
Is someone who's lost and insecure.

So you say, that I am rated X.
You suffer from the lack of sex.
Black heart and your lipstick smeared.
Your points are trite, and not too sober
to deal with your running over.
Your same pathetic cliche lines

You say that you want respect
Well then you better get some for yourself.
Cause all that I see right now
Is someone who's lost and insecure

Don't try to be cute with me
Cause I know you hurt yourself.
And you'd end your stupid life now
but you're too spineless.

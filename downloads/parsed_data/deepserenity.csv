"event","well yesterday i had a really fun day. it was very relaxing. i woke up went to linens and things to get some money back on some stuff and then i went to look at these really cute glasses i found with my mom. then i rushed home and got ready to go swimming at caseys dads house. eric picked me up and we met crystal and casey at the apartmemt the we were off. we had to do a little pool cleaning but it was a pretty nice pool. we went swimming on and off the entire day it seemed. after going to this grocery store place we- eric and casey- made burgers so that was good. we even got casey to play a board game- sorry- eric won. we watched back to the future 2 and went swimming a little more and then me and eric took a shower. oh and i forgot to mention that we went swimming naked for half of the time we went swimming... that was interesting..."

"event","wow i havent written in this or anything else in a really long time so i thought i would do a little typing today...i just got back from my summer welcome at mizzou. i think i got a lot out of it. i was kind of getting used to the campus though i know that will end by tomorrow when i forget it all. it kinda sucked that a lot of the classes were already filled. all the english classes were filled which kinda made me sad cause that was the only class i knew i was going to take. so i am taking just a variety of classes. yesterday was me and erics 6 month anniversary. i saw him the night before for a while but not yesterday during the day or nite. i was really sad. i just thought i was going to be able to see him and then didnt. some people are really annoying me lately i just cant stand to be around them. man. i have had some really weird dreams lately too. weird i tell you.l well i could write more about everything but instead i am going to take a shower."

Apparently Norwegian is the easiest language to learn for a native English speaker. The argument's certainly quite convincing, conjugation looks like an absolute doddle."

Wait, not yay. Boooooooooooooo-urns. Holy fuck, expensive books. Good news: I already have one of them from that dropout who gave me his books. Unfortunately the other two are out of date and by the wrong authors respectively, which is not so good.

Anyway, here's how my course breaks down this year:
120 credits in total.
60 credits of Chemistry.
40 credits of French.
20 credits of Maths.
Unfortunately I can't do any frivolous option modules. Quel dommage.

In other news, I've got my computer back... sorta. Kinda. It's basically the same case with a new motherboard, hard drive, CD drive, video card*, RAM, power supply, sound card*, and kitchen sink.

*I didn't actually get either of these. I'm hoping this was a mistake, unless by ""I'll put in a better graphics card"" he meant ""You'll have to use the integrated graphics."" Also, my sound card's gone. And the processor is a Celeron. So I'm going to have to make a few slight changes.
On the other hand this was all free (apparently) and my old hard drive is still in there and working. Plugging my MP3 player into it has killed the palyer, so I'll have to try sending that back.

I learned today that my friend Greg got drunk and made out with the daughter of my deputy head teacher (he's the one who really pissed me off last year.) Lollerwaffles! Ahahahaha. And so on. This happened on a religious pilgrimage to Lourdes, by the way.

Today I also saw the simpsons movie! Spider pig and so forth. It was rather like a very big simpsons episode, but that didn't detract from the enjoyability."

The kid playing Fizzy was a great actor, but his song was just out of his range, so it sounded crap. In fact, almost all of them were singing outside of their ranges... which is a pity.<br /><br />Me, I was at the lighting desk. There's such a huge amount of cues that the lighting guy couldn't follow it without my help.<br /><br />Now I'm wondering whether to go to a party tomorrow or go to Steve's house.

The lulz come from how just after we went to bed, Adam (middle brother) slammed my door open, flicked on both lights, and shouted ""<b>OH SHIT!</b>"" as he undid both and fled the scene.<br /><br />Yeah bitch, you don't go in my room. Bitch. Yeah. I'm certain he was only coming in here to take something of mine, because there's no other reason at all to enter my bedroom.<br /><br />Then this afternoon Richard saw us (lightly) entangled and seemed cool when Steve greeted him. Hmm.<br /><br />We're going to the Lowry tomorrow to see Maria, and depending on parents I may be staying with Rob next week for LAN-related geekiness.<br /><br />EDIT: SO IMPORTANT MUST EDIT THIS IN. Not. Richard AMBUSHED me on my return from the chinese place in the village and asked me about Steve. Inquiries about who he is, what he does, his age... and whether the rest of the family knows. He seemed to take it very well, honestly. There's hope for him yet!"

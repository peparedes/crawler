friday, i got picked up by dave and me him dan and matt went back to daves house a played poker. yeah i didnt win, but thats how it always is. drank tons of soda. and was off the wall. theeen went to the basketball game in SK. wasnt as good as last year but was entertaining. 

saturday, nothing. sunday, nothing cept football. Eagles barely won, if they lost i woulda cried. 
 
monday, school sucked like always. then had drivers ed. got an 83 on my quiz. it is going very well so far. not doing too well in school again. gotta bring them grades up by the break so i can get my permit. got dinner came home. me dan and my dad went to pick up dan murray and then headed to warwick for a college fair to check out colleges. i was interested in Becker Univ., Springfield, Fitchburg State and Sacred Heart, and also Assumption and Utica werent bad. buuuuut to play football i must get taller. lol.

today was kinda... weird. i couldnt stop thinking about jane. i really wanna get over her, but i just cant. its sooo hard. but whatever, maybe its just how its supposed to be.

"event","well uhhh havent updated in a while so... 

sunday - I went to the movies to see National Treasure. Very good movie. Saw Mr. Whittaker there haha.

Monday - No school. Me and Jane broke up to be friends for a while.

Tuesday - Did absolutely nothing during the day. Then went to the St. Rays/La Salle game. La Salle won in a blowout but it was a very amusing game as 4 kids got kicked out. Umm got to see a couple of kids I played against in PW. And got to see Cory Baker for the first time in a while. Also met a couple girls from Saints.

Wednesday - School... Yep sucked. First day of Driver's Ed. Haha the teacher is hilarious.

Thursday - School again. Sucked. Second day of DE.

Friday - Good day of school. English I got my seat moved to the wall haha! She yelled at me cuz I kept turning around and she was being dumb about it even though I finished all my work. Then Youth/Law that class always sucks. Then French I kept gettin' away with not doing my homework. HAHA. She asked everyone at my table but she didn't ask me if I did it lol. Then Study I fell asleep and woke up to the clock saying 1:30. I got excited and decided to walk to the bathroom to waste time and make the class get over faster. Come back and it says 1:15... turns out it was going backwards lol. 

Went home on the bus for the first time in the longest time. Then the rest of the night sucked cuz no one was online. Except for Sam. She saved my night=). Haha.

Today - It was alright. Went to pick up my cousin then went to get Burger King and then Wal Mart. Bought Need for Speed Underground 2. Umm then came home and chilled for a while.

Well thats pretty much the whole week. 

Enjoy."

I missed 4 games overall. oh well onto better things. homecoming was excellent... probably the best thing thats happened to me this year so far. =) Jane... oh man. i havent been so happy in a long time. shes perfect. 

Halo 2 also came out. that game is awesome.

thats all i can think of to write.

oh yeah! im taking drivers ed the 1st! i cant wait. mom wont let me get permit until i get honor roll though whcih sucks. ill live though.

"event","i havent been okay for the last couple months, ive had so many freaking breakdowns i lost count.  if it wasent for bryon and amelie, i would be less okay.  i dislike my sister with a passion she is just unbelieveble she says she dosent dress slutty but you can see her pubic hair because her shorts are so low.  she is a bitch i almost broke her nose with a water bottle yesterday but i hit her in the arm instead.  i just had a crappy day yesterday.  this weekend is my daddys birthday, jessi never goes to see him so she bowed out of this visit too,  its his god damn birthday, i wish she cared just a little because she dosent do anything for anyone else.  Whats the point anymore.

Christen: you need to come back."

Not always just the traffic jam
Hit me hard enough to wake me
And lead me wild to your dark roads

Headlights... before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out... and take it

You are attracted to good manners and elegance.<br />
<br />
In love, you feel the most alive when things are straight-forward, and you're told that you're loved.<br />
<br />
You'd like to your lover to think you are loyal and faithful... that you'll never change.<br />
<br />
You would be forced to break up with someone who was insecure and in constant need of reassurance.<br />
<br />
Your ideal relationship is lasting. You want a relationship that looks to the future... one you can grow with.<br />
<br />
Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.<br />
<br />
You think of marriage as something precious. You'll treasure marriage and treat it as sacred.<br />
<br />
In this moment, you think of love as commitment. Love only works when both people are totally devoted.

"event","Lately I've been thinking about what my new year's resolution should be.  I wonder who came up with the idea of new year's resolutions in the first place.  I remember when I was little I always made a resolution to clean my room, I think that has actually been one of my resolutions every year.  I've never been one to try and change things about myself, because I think you should be happy, or try to be happy with who you are, chances are your not really going to be able to change it either way, and you shouldnt be dissapointed with what or who you are.  I suppose that is somewhat hypocritical, I try and change myself a lot.  I guess I just think you should only change because you want to, not because someone else wants you too.

When you sit in a quiet office with absolutly nothing to do, you think about things.  Well I think about things.  This year I want to trust myself, and others enough to take steps forward, to not worry so much about what could happen, and say lets see what does happen.  After all, if you don't let go a little bit and just see what happens, then really, what is the point?"

"event","Well I enjoy reading people's live journals, I don't think they are full of a lot of deep feelings or anything like that, more so just the general going-ons and thoughts in my friends lives, and it seems that as school gets more hectic I find myself turning to the live journal to see what is going on with my friends, who I usual see during the week running from one commitment to the next.  I like the live journals, makes me feel...less out of the loop.

It seems like it has been forever since I was sitting at home this summer wondering if it were possible that the time could pass any slower, and now it has, and these past few weeks have been so insane, filled with classes, commitments, and bad news, I almost wish I could go back, and just start over.  I'm taking 18 credit hours (which are all my music major classes, so that naturally means 18 hours and 47 classes) most of them are okay, and I really enjoy, but there are also a few that I don't.  Jazz tech, a one credit hour class, with a teacher who not only has one of those horrible mono-tone voices, but seems to have not the slightest idea, that yes, the class does know how to work blackboard and it is not necessary to spend half the class explaining how to see the assigments.  Oh well, have to get it over with, so now seems like a great opportunity.  I have a feeling this semester is going to be extremely stressful and insane, but I suppose I set myself up for it, when I decide I can take on everything, all the while still thinking Im going to graduate in Spring 2007.  We'll see...

Ever learned something you didn't want to know?  And then you really wish that you could just go back and erase the knowledge, ignorance is bliss right?  I like to think that with time it will get better, but for now its a little rough.    But this of course is normal for me, and I should have seen something coming.  Maybe for once it will be different...HA!  Its exactly the same as everything else...only this time not as easy to solve.  Sometimes I think that the older you get, and the more you learn, the harder it becomes to make a decision.  So for now, i'll just do whats easy, what will keep life content, and for now, i'll just pretend that everything is A-Ok."

Well I'm done working, for the most part.  I basically stopped going to friday's last week (after saying thats what I was going to do for what 3 months?) but they already had my notice, and took me off the schedule for this weekend, which was really nice.  Just finished my last week of the summer program at Reaching Potentials, and I can honestly say that I have never had a more rewarding job.  Yes my kids bite, kick and scream, but honestly, how many of you can say that you have watched, in a short period of six weeks, see a kid who only babbles at three, learn to say 'i love you' to his mom?  By far, something I know I will never forget.  

Finished with my classes this past week as well.  I got an A in Developmental Psych (which hopefully I will be able to pass off as a class I need?) and no idea what I got in Precalc (aka college algebra that I already failed once?) as long as I passed im happy, which I think I did.  Not very good when it comes to math as many of you know.  

I'm very excited to go back to school, I've for the most part gotten everything I need, now its just time to pack.  I'm leaving on Thursday with my mom, we will probobly get there on Friday.  I'm ready for this year, and I suppose I have said that every year, but I really think things are going to be different.  I'm just really happy, and really feel good about where everything is going.  And I've got to tell you I haven't felt that way in, forever really, and its nice, its really nice."

"event","So summer just got really busy for me, but at least I've also just realized thats its not that far to the end, which is good :-).

I started my job with the summer program at Reaching Potentials.  For those of you who don't know, Reaching Potentials is an organization my mom and four other moms started about ten years ago.  Its a program that pairs families with therapists to work with children with Autism.  The therapy uses applied behavior analysis, and basically teaches the young kids with autism how to do things that most kids pick up from the enviornment, but they do not.  So thats what I do, and I like it, its a lot of fun, and actually makes me feel like Im doing something worthwhile, much more than I can say for the job at fridays...

Still working at fridays though, I figure in another two weeks i'll give my two weeks notice, and for now its still money, which is good.  But my schedule is a little full, I work monday through thursdays from 8:30 to 5 at reaching potentials, then I go to class Monday through Thursday from 7:00 to about 9:15, then I work at fridays on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, usually from 5 until they decide I can go home.  Busy, but at least it makes the week go by pretty fast.

I just plan on pretty much doing that until the end of summer, which will hopefully come sooner rather than later...though Im not so convinced..."

"event","So I really need to do my math homework, it's about 4:45, and Im bored but not in the mood to do math, so I figure I can put it off for another 15 minutes.  Im taking precalc at home, to attempt to pass, hopefully ill get it the second time around, but those of you who attempted to help me with college algebra the first time, know that its very questionable, haha, its ok, ill get it eventually.  Im also taking a developmental psych class, and so far its awful, which is suprising because I really like psychology, but I blame it partially on the teacher and partially on the other people in class, they talk a lot and get very off topic, I hate that.  Oh well, hopefully it will make the summer go by faster, so far its going by very very slow, not that Im suprised...

I got a job as a hostess at fridays, and I hate it, Im going to quit tomorrow.  I really think its just that I don't have the right personality for it, but I also think its the people I work with, and its very boring, and I feel very unproductive.  But Im going to quit tomorrow, and train to be a behavioral therapist and then work with kids with autism for a few weeks before the summer program starts.  Im looking forward to it, makes me feel like im actually helping someone, because I will be, and thats kind of the point of life isnt it?  More so then helping people find somewhere to sit anyways.  

Well so far summer doesnt seem to be changing anything, which is good, but im still cautious, because I dont have a very good track record for this sort of thing.  But we'll see, Im optimistic :-) I think thats enough for now, this is a big update for me, hope everyone else's summer is going well. 

I miss you :-)"

"event","So yes, its been awhile since I updated this journal, but I've been busy and haven't really had that much to say.  I guess since this is the start of what I expect to be a long and boring summer I might as well update.  

Im glad that school is over, though things were going really well when I left and it was sad to leave, but its really nice to think about the fact that I have three months to do nothing.  Im glad that I get to spend my summer at home with my family, its one of the drawbacks to going to school so far away, I can't exactly drive home for the weekend when I want to, so its nice to be home.  Next year I'll get into professional sequence and real music education classes, which I'm really excited about, but its really scary to think about the fact that I'm halfway done with school, the first two years have gone by really fast and I know the next two will as well.  Scary, but still exciting.

I hate the summer, I hate the fact that everything in essence just stops.  Like a big commercial, then you expect everything to go back to the way it was when you left, but it never does.  I hope its different this time around, but I dont expect it to be, guess I'll just have to wait and see, only time can tell right?

Hope everyone else successfully made it through finals, and juries. :-)"

"event","Well the hurricane, tropical storm, whichever came and went, didn't really do all that much here, but at least we get out of class tomorrow.  I'm happy about that, because it means that I don't have to go to sightsinging or piano all week.  

It wasn't all that long ago when I used to think that you couldn't really depend on anyone but yourself.  People would say that they were there for you, but that really meant they were there for you either when it was convient for them, or until they just didn't feel like it anymore.  I'm sure that that attitude came from a million and one different experiences, but it was still how I felt.  Someone made me start to change my mind, but today Im starting to go back to that same attitude.  Seems like the ones that I really need to listen, won't, and the people who are ready and willing just don't understand.  You know I've been told more times than I've cared to here that I spend to much time living for the moment.  Yet I think I put to much thought into how what I'm doing now affects the future that I miss the important things, who knows.  I just want to be able to figure out what the right things are, and where I want them to go.  Then again, I guess everyone is looking for that.  I just worry it's staring me in the face and I'm to busy worrying about it to notice.

""There's one sad truth in life I've found
While journeying east and west -
The only folks we really wound
Are those we love the best.
We flatter those we scarcely know,
We please the fleeting guest,
And deal full many a thoughtless blow
To those who love us best."""

"event","Well it's been awhile, and I'm bored, so I figured I would go ahead and make an update.  Classes are now well underway, and I can tell that this semester is going to be much more stressful, than I had anticipated...great, just what I need...

So far classes are going okay, Music theory is off to a better start than last semester, my professor is much easier to understand, and generally speaking gives us the majority of the answers on most of the assignments.  I HATE SIGHTSINGING.  I have never come across a class that I truly hate, but this class is ridiculous.  First of all, I don't sing, unless its a song I like on the radio...but certainly not out of a book.  And I do not understand why I have to take the same sightsinging class as vocal majors, OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN SING!  And for them to sightsing? What kind of crap is that? THATS ALL THEY DO! Its so frustrating, and I don't like the fact that I have to search for a good reason to go to class...and its only the second week.   Survey of Music lit doesnt seem to be nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be...but who knows, it could get worse.  I think that covers everything, except piano, chamber winds, chiefs, and lessons...but those are self explanatory.

Other than that things are...going...Maybe with this whole hurricane fiasco classes will be cancelled next week.  It would be nice not to have to go to sightsinging AT ALL next week...

My birthday was really nice, I got to hang out with all my candidate sisters and I love that, they always make me feel better, even when there not trying to.  Whenever we all spend time together we all have a great time, and I can't imagine what things would be like if we didnt have the bond that we do.

I had my audition yesterday, which did not go at all as I had hoped.  None of yesterday went as I had hoped actually, but thats another story.  I get so frustrated because you work so hard for one specific audition, and then its over.  And its not like there is anyway to redeem myself.  I just want to have one audition, just one, where I can go in there and actually show the stupid professor, (who despite how many conversations I have with her still has no idea who I am) that I can really play.  Oh well...I'm suppose to go in and play for her today, and I'm going to ask about getting a certificate in performance, because im pretty sure I can throw the whole double major thing out the window.

"event","Well I'm back at FSU now (Woo-Hoo!!)  Its really exciting to be back here with everyone, and seeing everyone at chiefs is awesome.  I suppose I should start back with the process of actually getting here.  Well I left Rochester on Thursday, and my mom was freaking out because the stupid hurricane was heading straight for tampa, and it was looking like I could get stuck in Atlanta.  All of my flights ended up being just fine, with a slight delay in Atlanta due to the hurricane activity.  When I did get to tampa Thursday night, the whether forcast was still forcasting for a direct hit to the tampa area.  Which would figure, the way my luck has been going lately, finally within grasp of getting back to school, and a stupid hurricane is going to ruin my plans!  Well, the hurricane actually ended up hitting south of tampa, and all we had was some wind and rain, and everything worked well for getting here on Saturday.  Saturday I spent the day unpacking and whatnot, and now everything, well...most everything is seeming to find its place.

Today was the first chiefs practice, and MAN did it kick my butt, not as bad as I thought it would, but its been a long time since I've done that chief step.  I think that this season is going to be awesome :-)

Its really great to be back (with my favorite menemeny who I have missed oh so much!) I still have some lingering questions about a few things, but I suppose only time will tell :-p"

"event","Well as the summer is winding down I'm realize how much things here are beginning to drive me insane.  I think that I have said this before, but I really think it has a lot to do with this location, and this house, when I think about ""memories"" here, not a lot of good comes to mind.  Oh well, I guess thats the price you pay for moving a million times.  At least, for now, it seems that my parents planning on staying here, so at least my younger brothers and sister won't have to experience three different high schools.

My younger sister, who just turned 16 had been getting into a lot of trouble before she left for interlochen.  (Which is an 8 week arts camp) My parents had the hope that she would do well this summer and come home with a little more discipline.  Well needless to say that didn't work out so well, and last week my sister was kicked out of camp, and now she is home.  My parents, at the time, were furious. Understandably so.  They had all these plans for her, talks of sending her to boarding school, whatever it took, because this was just ""so awful"".  Well, apparently, they have had a change of heart, because now her punishment is merely, she can not talk on the phone or the computer ""for a little while.""  Which, generally speaking she does anyways.  Interesting the way parents, or mine inparticular, treat different children.  Shortly after I moved here, the end of my junior year in high school, I ran up a rather large phone bill.  Naturally, my parents were mad, which I expected, they barely let me breathe for 3-4 months.  I paid the phone bill, but they still talk about the incident.  Interesting...my sister costs them 6,000 and has hardly scratched the surface...and yet they chalk it up to the fact that ""im the oldest.""  Needless to say, im ready to get out of here.  I'm ready for chiefs, I'm ready to see my favorite menemeny, I'm ready for everything.

Hope everyone is enjoying their final days of summer, and that for all of you moving in and whatnot, get enough people recruited to help (i'd help you if i could toni =))

See you soon."

"event","So today I had planned to go to a DCI show that is being held a couple hours from here, everything was all set and I was looking forward to it, and then yesterday, the girl who was suppose to cover my shift tonight told me she couldnt, and so now I'm stuck working.  A little bummed out about that one, oh well. 

Not a whole lot has been going on around here, I've just been working and getting ready to head back to school.  I'm still trying to figure out how exactly I am going to be able to get everything back that I brought home with me.  Because when I left, Jennie came home with me, so I just had her check extra bags, but seeing as how I am the only one heading back, it posses alittle bit of a problem, not to mention the fact that I have acumulated a few more things since I've been home.  

Work has been pretty uneventful, but I did have a rather interesting experience on saturday. I was working, and my boss was there, and this guy came in saying that he wanted a teriaki sub.  So my boss made it for him, the guy comes up to the register bought that and a drink, and then he just stood there for a good 3 minutes.  I was ringing some other people up and he was still just standing there staring.  I asked him if there was anything else that I could help him with and he just goes ""Sir"" (trying to get my bosses attention) and he says ""I don't want this sub, you can just throw it away"" and tosses it across the counter.  My boss asks him what the problem is, and he says ""its to messy I could never eat this!"" He hadn't even taken it out of the bag! And he just walked out of the store, didnt ask for his money back or anything...I have seen some wierd peole come in, but I must say this tops the charts.

**Mollye-- I was really glad that we got to talk last night, I know that your going through a rough time right now, I promise you it will get better.  Don't listen to what everyone else has to say about it, you have all the answers, just listen to what your heart is telling you to do.  Your a great girl, any guy would be lucky to have you, even if the one you want is too dumb to see it, I'm always here for you whenever you need it.**

I miss everyone (especially my favorite menemeny) I hope that you all are having a great summer. :-)

***You know for the first time in a long time I am actually happy with my life.  Seems like someone is looking out for me.  I don't care if you want to tell me that I'm just a stupid florida girl, or whatever else you want to say.  I like to think that one day you will come around, but until then, I'm not going to let you bring me down.***"

"event","So I finally quit the evil job, which I'm really happy about.  I don't know what it was about it, but it defenitly just wasn't worth it.  I'm glad that summer is finally winding down, although it seems like the closer fall semester gets, the slower time seems to go by. But I am again realizing how stressful it is trying to get my schedule to work out! The joys of being a music major, 12 classes for 15 credit hours...beat me in the face.

This weekend is Jennie and Mollye's birthday and I really wish that I could be there!  I hope that both of you have a fabulous weekend :-) (psst...someone throw them in the fountain...)

Everything else around here has been going rather well, my parents will again be gone for the weekend, just like every other weekend I suppose, but at least things can be a little calmer around here.  

I hope that everyone else is having a great summer, I miss you all :-)

"event","Well it's been awhile since I wrote, and I'm bored, so I figured I would :-).  Not a whole lot has been going on up here in the arctic.  I've been working a lot, which is good for me, but I've come across some scheduling conflicts between both jobs, even though I only work maybe once a week at the second one, I work everyday at the other, so I think I might have to quit the evil job, we shall see.  I'm going to tallahassee this weekend which I am very excited about, not only am I dying to get out of this horrible place, but I'm really excited to see everyone there.  Today is my first day off in awhile, and I was going to try and be constructive, but so far thats not looking so good.  So far, I've cancelled a lesson, cancelled babysitting for tomorrow, and my plans to wash roxy are out, because it defenitly looks like its going to rain.  I am getting a new flute when I come back from tallahassee which is very exciting! I did not think that my dad was going to come around on that one.  But I'm pretty sure that once he bought my sister that oboe he knew it was coming.  I think it will be very helpful :-)  Aside from the usual stuff, I have essential been working and playing mom, since my parents are never home.  So today I am going to do the same...and maybe go shopping :-)"

"event","So another week has gone by, its been a slow one, but another week none the less. Everything up here has been going okay, to say the least, but Ive had about enough of summer.  Ive been working alot, which has its ups and downs, money is good, but the working part...not so much...haha

I have come to realize that there are a lot of ignorant people in the world.  The other day I was working, and I was helping this one girl, who was a little slow, and I could tell that she had some sort of mental disability, and there were two other girls who came in as I was helping her. I told them that I would be with them in a minute, and the whole time that I was helping the first girl, I could hear their sarcastic comments, and the two of them making fun of her.  I know that I tend to be much more judgemental of this sort of thing, due to my own personal background, but seriously, two adult people, I like to think there are better people in the world then that.  When the one girl left, and I then went to help the other two, I listened to the one girl explain to her friend that she was a senior education major at Nazareth (the local college here).  That really blew my mind, I can't imagine how someone can want to be an education major, yet can sit there and make fun of another person for having a disability...

Other than the general tension in my household, my parents have both been traveling a lot, which naturally leaves all the responsibilities to me, and today my dad was upset because I could not bring JP and Ellen to the golf course for him, becuase I had to work.  My younger sister katy however is enjoying her new oboe she recieved for her birthday, despite the fact that she has gotten in trouble for getting caught with drugs, drinking the works...go figure, and they yell at me for not making the bed.  The car battle is still going on, but I am making some progress.

I think that is enough for now, just wanted to make an update...and I wanted to remind a few of my dearest friends, who I know are going through some rough times of a quote to always keep in mind.  ""Everything will be okay in the end, if it's not okay, then it's not the end.""  Hope everyone is having a great summer. :-)"

"event","I have a pretty uneventful last few days.  I haven't felt too good, and the last two days have shown accordingly.  Yesterday I went to work, I had to open by myself, and I about killed myself, just being the general clutz that I am, and even worse off when I am tired, and not feeling so great.  Came home excited to watch the race, only to watch my driver crash on the last lap...not so cool, but he still went up in the standings, so thats a plus.  Today it was raining here, had to work alittle, then I came back and watched a disturbing movie, and took a nap.  Very exciting...

I was glad to talk to mollye, I always think that we have alot we can relate on.  Though I know nothing will help, I've been there, and I know how hard it is.  If nothing else, at least she knows she's not the only one whose had to go through it.  Though I honestly wish I could say I hadn't...oh well...just one of those things I guess. 

We'll see what the next week brings, I have a dentist appointment tomorrow that I am not looking forward too, the dreaded wisdom teeth prognosis...great..."

"event","Today has defenitly been a long day.  I found out that I didnt make leadership, which I was pretty bummed about, but I'm really excited for everyone who did make it, and I talked to Christina about it this afternoon and she made me feel alot better.  She's defenitly my favorite secret adopted big sister. :-)  Guess it just goes to show that things don't always go the way that you hope them too.  With any luck, nothing else will go to disasterously wrong.  Despite everything, I'm still hoping to take the trip to tallahasse, which will hopefully give me something to look forward too.

Work has been going rather well, im starting to like it, however having to jobs has proven to be more difficult then I expected, and I haven't even started the second one yet, and I've already come across a few scheduling conflicts, hopefully before too much longer I will get that under control.  

Its starting to warm up here, which is good, and we started opening up the pool this weekend, so hopefully it will be up and running before too much longer.  Getting a new car this week, possibly tomorrow, which is rather exciting, despite the fact that I dont have a whole lot to say in the matter, and that I don't get to choose when Im ""allowed"" to have it at school, but the fact that I can actually say its mine is pretty cool.

I hope that everyone else is having a fabulous summer, and congrats to everyone who made leadership!  I miss you all."

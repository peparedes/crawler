The traveling wall memorial exhibit was out on the center lawn when I walked up this morning.  I did not know it was scheduled to stop here.  My words do not truly do it justice; there was no way to include CHILD without leaving out something else in the tanka format, and JUST a wall was meant to convey the simple, but deciving, nature of the display.  It is just a wall, but the impact is rather like a punch to the gut.  Talk about INSPIRATION!"

ok, so Im a bit behind.&nbsp; Xmas eve, whats not to be happy about?&nbsp; 
I found ALL the gifts I could not find in all my&nbsp;shopping last week&nbsp;&nbsp;in one fell swoop this afternoon on the way home from feeding a friends cats - WHOOT its nice when the good karma is right there.
Had a nice hour of poppyseed loaf, coffee, candles and carols with the parents, then ran home to wrap presents (Like I said, Im behind.. wrap at 5 to unwrap 3 hours later ;-)
Back to mom and dads for a cup of soup and a movie (mom got to open her present early - Mama-Mia) then baby bother finally got off work and showed up with both dogs (my niece and nephew - Dachshunds - he is 16.5 now, she has a grapefruit-sized&nbsp;tumor and was given&nbsp;2 months to live back in August.)&nbsp; so it was WONDERFUL to see both of them still wagging their tails and wanting loving.&nbsp; We had the usual fantastic dinner, then opened presents and took photos of the dogs enjoying their treats and the new dogbed they got.

Happiness is baking with your mom!&nbsp; 
I had a lovely day today in mom's kitchen.&nbsp; We had holiday tunes on to keep us in the right mood (and both sang along at times) while I blanched almonds and she sifted flour, I chopped almonds and she mixed butter and sugar , I opened tins of poppy seeds and she added eggs, we checked the dough, then took a break for lunch.&nbsp; After lunch I rolled out dough while she mixed poppy seeds with eggs and almonds to make 'asphalt.'&nbsp; Together we spread the filling on the&nbsp;dough then needed all four hands and 2 long towels&nbsp;to roll up the probably 40&quot; long 'jelly roll' (really&nbsp;filled with&nbsp;poppy seeds not cream&nbsp;or jelly)&nbsp; Finally we&nbsp;cut it&nbsp;into 4 lengths and gently lifted each into a&nbsp;prepared loaf pan.&nbsp; close to 2 hours later we had 4 yummy cakes, sadly they need to sit at least 24 hours before they taste good (I took a tiny nibble hot from the oven, and it did not taste like I know it will by the 25th.) 
This is a recipe we traditionally make in December and ONLY&nbsp;ever make for xmas, and we have made it for as long as I can remember. 
Family traditions, another wonderful thing."

We also had appetizers of pickled herring, gravlax (sorry storebought this time,) cold shrimp, radishes, marinated mozzarella balls. Dessert was the amazing assortment of cookies everyone brought - the worlds best gingersnaps, wonderful sugarcookies, lintzer bars (yum) and more that I did not sample. <br />We toasted the end of the year, the start of the new, the season in general, and all friends (passed, present and yet to meet) with a bottle of homebrewed mead (Catsclaw honey about 10 years old and much better than I remembered.) <br /><br />It was a wonderful evening, the warm glow of the candles matched the warm feeling of being with friends, the songs of the season and the warm food on the table.

Every card in the Tarot speaks differently to everyone, but the Priestess seems to bear the widest range of interpretations, because she speaks directly to the Inner Voice, the unconscious mind. She is the manifestation of the unconscious and the effects of the mysterious in our everyday world. Trying to see how such mysteries work often defeats their purpose, and with this in mind, the High Priestess will be explained in as much detail as possible.</p><br /><p>She is, above all else, the base of potential that is the source of the power wielded by the Magician. She is the unlimited potential that allows him to transform and create whatever his Will desires. Understanding this type of balance, as found between potential and creation, masculine and feminine, is the key to unlocking some of the mysteries of the High Priestess. We see the clear progression of the theme of balance; instead of integrating opposites, the Priestess keeps them separate and keeps them in balance nonetheles. She herself is the scales; this symbolism is found in many Tarot decks. Without this balance there can be no power.</p><br /><p>The second symbolic motif found in almost all instances of the High Preistess are symbols of the unconscious mind. On the Rider-Waite version this motif is especially prominent, but most decks feature at least some lunar imagery that in turn has ties to the unconscious. Most decks that have the &quot;twin pillars&quot; symbology also depict a veil strung between those pillars; the High Priestess stands between us and that veil as a moderator. Behind the veil lies the powers of the unconscious, which we cannot start to understand but which, through her, we can learn to control. She is the gateway to realms that we may never fully comprehend or master.</p><br /><p>While it would be impossible for anyone to learn all of her mysteries and secrets, the High Priestess remains as a guide to those of us willing to venture deep within our minds to discover the true powers hidden deep inside each of us. This is the same power as that depicted on the Magician, but the scope of the Priestess' power is far different. While the Magician focuses his powers outward, to achieve a meaningful effect on the world, the High Priestess shows us that we can also use these powers on an inner level, to enrich and transform ourselves. Such transformations are certainly not as dramatic as the Magician's, but they are almost always more powerful.</p><br /><p>The High Priestess represents the mysteries of the unconscious and the Inner Voice, and her appearance is often a sign that your own intuition is trying to send you a message. The unconscious often speaks to us in symbols, so be alert around you for anything that seems out of the ordinary. This said, if you have an important decision to make when the Priestess appears, this is often a sign that the answers will be revealed to you, if you are patient and open to the whispers from within. You simply have to wait and be receptive to inner messages. Her lesson is that everything you need to know already exists within you.</p><br /><p>The theme of dualism in the High Preistess cannot be avoided either. She is often a sign of the Shadow, the negative portion of your personality that no one sees, and that you yourself could be unaware of. (In this sense, the term 'negative' does not refer to evil, just the opposite polarity from the positive and expressive part of your personality.) If you accept the Shadow within you, its powers will be open to you if you wish to use them. In most people the Shadow side is the more passive of the two, and the Priestess can therefore advocate a need for passivity in a situation. It is not always necessary to act; sometimes goals can be realized through inaction.</p></lj-cut><p><a href=""http://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/which-tarot-card-represents-your-higher-self-test"">Take Which Tarot Card Represents Your Higher Self?

"event","<P>The Retreat was pretty cool. I mean yeah, I wanted to go home, and stuff like that... me and David both wanted to go home, but we had our reasons, and when we finally decided to go home, we figured out it was to late, lol ""Life Sucks then you kill yourself"" What is up with that? I mean that reaally upset me, and you know who said it... Dude, your awesome, and you have nothing to worry about. There was a band there called Zone 180, it was so awesome! I loved Mikeys hair... The people in the band were: </P>
<P>Mikey Devan Suzanna Asa Aaron umm ya know what? I forgot the rest of their names, lol They are a reallly cool praise band, Lil' Amber as I call her, even though she is older than me, she was flirtin with all the guys... lol see, I judged a book by its cover, she is really cool, like, it would agervate alot of us because she was flirting with him, but yeah, I tlked to her on the ride home for a second, she is cool. I got sick yesterday @ the retreat... like after I ate lunch, bc that was the first meal I had ate in a 2 days, I threw it up. I mean yeah, I didn't mean to, then I thre up a couple more times, then my face started going red and stuff, and I was freezing, then I was in the fan freezing, and they had the heat on to, then Bradely asked me if I was hot bc my face was red, then I said no, then he asked me if I was feeling okay, then I said no... we got to the Church, I grabbed my blanket, and wrapped up in it outside, and then I started crying cause I didn't feel good at all... Later that night, my headache got worse... My night got even worse, someone ran off bc he got someone else in trouble, but he was already upset before that, so he ran off, we searched for him for an hour, kept calling his house to see if he went home, then his parents started to get worried, then they went looking for him, then about 2 hrs after he was gone, they found him, Thank God. Well Im trying to get ready for school, I feel worse today I mean Im going ot school, no stopping me. Everyeone tried to bring me home yesterday when I was sick, but I wouldn't let them Well time to get my shoes and eyeliner on... &lt;3 Jade</P>"

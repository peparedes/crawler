i can't help it, does anyone else find it pretty funny?  eh?  the press conference was golden.  GOLDEN.</center>

ok so.  i don't actually have anything all that important to say.  uh, january's over.  which i'm pretty <u>stoked</u> about.  lordy its the longest worst month ever.  no offense kennz.  i know its your birth month and all.  but i was hatin' on january hardcore.  

BTW its fuckin cold here.  i don't think you understand.  i look so insane all bundled up all the time.  
ok for real i always start these with some topic in mind, and then i just sit here trying to think of something interesting to say.  well anyway.  god our room is a mess its so gloomy and cold outside i dont care what they say when you get to college you HATE snow (unless you are mckenna and get 3 hour delays for ice, luckyyy) i think i'm growing more and more neurotic and it probably scares a lot of people i tried to dye my hair last weekend but once again my head of hair is one resilient bitch and pretty much stayed the same color WTF LESLIE'S HAIR???  i've been eating a lot of fun dip lately and it reminds me of when ben used to play soccer when he was like 3 and i would watch and eat fun dip oh ben was such a cute little boy you know he came to visit the other weekend and we all just had a ball haha get it BALL STATE..WE HAD A BALL.  so.  yay for stream of conciousness.  thats whats on my mind, friends.

'thoroughly modern millie' has pretty much owned me these past couple of weeks, as most of you know on account of my incessant complaining.  i'm the PROPS MASTER, bitch.  you listen to every word i say.

so yeah this will be the most stressful weekend of my life-two papers and a test to manage.  and so i'm doing whats obviously most important:  updating livejournal, 'course.  the REAL issue at hand here folks is that THANKSGIVING BREAK is coming and i'ma eat and sleep and see pals.  PALS!  for one evening we will hang oh yes we will hang.  

megan i have your birthday gift and BOY is it swell!  not really sure why i said that on here, but i just got the last part of it today and i'm just excited.  

oh i just can't explain it.  this feeling inside (i'm not one of those who can easily hide).

this movie pretty much owns..the..world.  how can someone be that beautiful?  i dont know how.  

fall break is cominngggg and boy oh boy am i ready!!  seein' all mah homes back in the HC?  yes please.  hey guess what, its really cold.  so cold that rachel and i ran back real fast from the atrium and the asian creations that we ate were a'rumblin' in our tummies.  not a good feeling at all!  HOCUS FREAKING POCUS IS ON, FOOLS!  i was wondering when the ceremonial showing of this wonderful film would be.  that is why i love halloween and that is why i want to name my baby girl danny.  

k so i need your all's help.  every last one of yuhs.  what should i be for halloween FOR REALL?  cos i just dont know bout this manatee thing, i'd have to draw a snout on muh face and all (as megan kathleen and i discussed).  SO should i be:
1)a person.  famous like.  give me a suggestion, i'm too lazy to think of one now.
2)an animal.  not really a slutty one like in mean girls, just a normal kind of animal.
3)a..food item?  i'm running low of ideas hurr.
4)or a manatee as planned.  le sigh.

SOYEAH house of carters comes on soon.  at nine o'clock on e!, FYI.  you all should probably watch it.  
cant wait to see everyone this weekend so we can talk and hang and eat and gallop and do other various locomotor movements!

school's good aside from the fact that the combination of me, a big procrastinator, and college, a big fat ol bitch who likes to kill me with lotsa work, is not a good combination at all.  

well now i just can't think of anything of substance to say!  oh well except for, need i remind you fools, that mah birthday is on
<font size=""30"">wednesday september 20th.</font>
thats right, rejoice and all that shite, please.

then on the weekend of september 30th and october 1st i will be traveling to the university of kentucky to kick it back and generally shoot the shit with the gang and whatnot!!  i'm pretty damn excited and you all should be too.

"event","well here i am at ball state and after only three days of classes i have absolute calves of STEEL!  my first homework assignment is haunting me but i am not phased, dear readers.  i have not forgotten you, el-jay.  even though it has been oh about 8 days since i last updated.  

so i've basically been livin' it up, college style.  and when i say livin' it up i mean chillaxin' with my roomie, meeting various new people and feeling slightly awkward, slaving away at dance auditions (i already hate the dance department because not only are they crazy, the majority of them insist upon wearing sunglasses on top of their heads 1)INDOORS and 2)AT NIGHTTIME, stupid bitches), and classes.  spanish is currently and will continue to kick my ignorant ass, and the teacher reminds me wayyyyyy too much of roberto, my latin nutcracker lover.  which is awkward and makes me uneasy.  all other classes are tolerable, i suppose, save my honors class, aka CLASS FULL OF PRETENTIOUS YAPPING MANIACS WHO LOVE TO DISCUSS LINEAR PROGRESSION THROUGH THE YEARS AND PLATO AND I HATE YOU ALL BECAUSE I WANT TO SLEEP NOW.  

i miss dearly all of my university of kentucky darlings, who i have managed to converse with often.  i also think of my south carolinian mckenna oft, and tell her MCKENNA DONT YOU BAKE THAT MAN A PUMPKIN PIEEE!! YOU COOK FOR NO ONE EXCEPT FOR ME!  

i fear this entry is coming to and end because i need to analyze the poem ""to his coy mistress.""  hottt.

and now is today which has been full of a whole lotta gilmore, in celebration of el dia de los madres, of course.  and now i realize that i actually had no reason to type this rubbish but who cares, you read it anyway.  i wanted to add lots of pictures to make it like an interesting book but photobucket is being a big fatt butthole (snicker) and taking too long and grey's anatomy approaches!  man, it was going to have mr. price dancing pictures, one eyed dog pictures, and people wearing cow hats pictures.  you'll just have to settle with this:

"event","for anyone who appreciates cheesy jokes made by the infamous david, string quartet tributes to incubus, poor impersonations of baseball players by dancers, crazy intertwining fairytales including darth vader, hippies, techno captain hook pop songs, mckenna struttin' it like a stray cat, or me in knee pads dancing to the shins...then you should definitely attend our production of In Concert featuring Once Upon a Time in a Fairytale.  

When:  next saturday, march 18 at 7 or 7:30.  i never know what time anything starts.

Where:  the riverpark center.

Cost:  18-20ish dollars.  but the enrichment and enjoyment you gain from this event is priceless.

Why:  because your life will improve by 14% if you attend.  think of the tremendous amount of the arts you'll be exposed to!  it will surely blow your mind, friends.  and for those, like myself, who enjoy 14 wfie's sunrise show, you can enjoy watching us on it on monday morning.  ms. whats-her-face-squeeky-voice-blonde will be hanging with us from about 5:15 am till 7.  scoooore.

like i said, it will be a ball.  and we can go out and purchase milkshakes and french toast afterwards.  or whatever floats your boat.  so, yes.  that was me shamelessly self-promoting, and that was you bending to my will.  

in conclusion..

my day with robert(oh!):
he talk-a really fast and i no comprende some of the time.  all went well, considering it was my first time ever, practically, partnering.  most awkward moment-when roberto and norbe (clad in a ""PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN"" shirt with a huge american flag) talked in A LOT of spanish for DECADES while i stood there being really confused.  norbe smelt like coffee and cigarettes and hot cuban love.  roberto smelt like strong cologne, and sadly, thats the smell that rubbed off on me.  
saw GSA friends, which was a definite plus.  although one gave me a very confused look when i told her i was practicing for the part of marie (clara, in their version; she's played by an actual little girl in their version as well).
went to max and erma's with the padres and drank 4 glasses of dr. pepper.  3 hour rehersal+no water fountain=i will drink anything obtainable, including the blood from your veins.
went home, watched the labyrinth.  noticed how awesomely tight mr. bowie's pants were.  CROTCHCROTCHCROTCH.
and here i am.  a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.../random notting hill reference

LUV YA!!!11oneone"" thing gets sort of monotonous.  as we all know, though, only MALLRATS are cool enough to be myspace whores, afterall.  WOO HOO CLEANSING FIRE!

so i have to go camping tomorrow.  yeeeah.  no worries, i have alkaline trio, ray bradbury, and unsewn pointe shoes to keep me company.  little to no social interaction for 3-4 days wont be THAT bad, right?

so far this summer has been filled with lovely lovely movies...including the motorcyle diaries which is amazing and you all need to see it.  i want gael garcia bernal to father my children.  lords of dogtown as well (shut up, it was awesome and almost drove me to the point of writing john robinson a fan letter since my grandma knows this director that he worked with and that means we should marry), rules of attraction (that shannon whatsherface is the most beautiful woman i've ever seen), plus numerous attempted star wars marathons (actually only watching one movie at a time) and a revival of ""life as a house.""  random excursions to owensboro have also been delightful, even if austin is sometimes to cool to attend.  

if any of you see a hot little number with a chic new haircut out and about, that would be moi.  eat your hearts out.  i would post a picture with my bangs over my eyes and big ass sunglasses and blood red lipstick, but we lost out digital camera chord.  pity.

..hmm.  you know when sometimes you just THINK too much?  its just that when i want to just sit...or do some mindless task like take a shower or clean my room...there's nothing else for my brain to focus on other than my thoughts and it just drives me insane.  i have to, like, put on music or something usually so i won't worry so much...namely about things concerning plans that i've made, things i need to get done, or these nasty mean little thoughts that creep up and won't go away.  speaking of nasty, i've come to the realization that my senior year will be complete shit.  cheers.  (now ending the complaining about things that i have control over but have no backbone to actually change...but i DO care and thats why i'm doing them, you know?)

and hows that for random?  but isn't being vague so fashionable these days...

to change the subject...er, mckenna and i have a recital.  heh.  its this sunday.  i'm in both shows, i'm not sure about mckenna...but yeah, if she's in the second one, come to that one (at 3:30...but it fills up quickly).  or vise versa.  its FREE, bitches.  that means plenty of fun tumbling acts and looooong numbers of little todlers dancing around so their parents can say ""AWWWWW ISN'T (insert pronoun here...although its most of the time 'she') PRECIOUS?!!!!""  you have my permission to retreat to the lobby at these times.  god, i dont sound one bit bitter, do i?

i finished ""invisible monsters"" by chuck psiugrnpiuerg (i'm too lazy to think about or look up how to spell his name) and its very good and you must read it, friends.  you cool kids out there, give me a call sometime and we'll hang.  its what summer's for.

anyway, i thought i would put this on here because i am extremely bored and i happened to be on the messenger inquirer website and saw the information.  as many of you lovelies know, mckenna and i will be in a performance of ""peter pan"" (plus MORE...oo lala, so exciting..) soon.  its march 19th at...well, i'm not sure of the time.  either 7 or 7:30, definitely.  its at the riverpark center, of course, and tickets vary from $20.50, $18.50, and $5.75 for adults (what the heck?  i wonder what seats you have to get if you just pay $5.75...well, thats what the paper said, anyhow..) and $18.50, $16.50, and $5.75 for students.  you can call the riverpark box office at 687-2787 to buy tickets or to ask any questions.

whew, if THAT wasn't a shameless plug, then i dont know what is.  so, um, yeah.  referring back to the shameless plug...you all really would enjoy it.  the first act will be great this year and peter pan promises to be strange and...fun.  like always.  please come, if you wish.

lordy, i am so bored.  i suppose i could be doing something productive...like reading or doing precal or baking cookies.  but thats just too much effort.  the computer is convieniently in front of me, and i will embrace the livejournal whore-ness that i posess.  possess.  i think its posess.

L-O-V-E,
leslie."

"event","updating.  again.  it was either this or friday night lights, which is blaring on our living room tv with loud rap music and the pounding of bodies during a football game.

my rufus wainright was in the aviator.  if you need a reason to see that movie, make it that.  or that the movie was just awesome.

sherri dupree is ending her xanga.  now who will i stalk and model all of my hip journal entries after?? *pouts*  le sigh.

i feel like a lousy friend.  or person.

that is all, i suppose.

the way of the future. the way of the future.  the way of the future...

SPECIAL EDIT becauseifeelsortabad:  ok, so friday night lights wasnt that bad.  actually, i only saw the last 15 minutes but i cried like a freakin' baby.  i think it was the beautiful U2-esque guitar in the background.  so there you go."

"event","hi.  i'm back again, bitches, despite my hate of livejournal.  its so dumb.  but here i am, updating like a fool.  so what is new in the life of loverly leslie?  well...school is more of a drag than ever.  its ok during my first period office aid job, but then in journalism it goes slightly downhill, on account of the select stubborn seniors that populate that class (no offense to any of my faithful senior livejournal friends who just read that last comment).  then comes art, which is sucking now because a)crazy student teacher is...er..crazy, b)having your work criticized infront of the class is more than a humbling experience, and c)since i never have motivation in there, i sit and dred precalculus.  and after precalculus i dred chemistry.  everyday.  same cycle.  wake up, file office papers, become worried, repeat.

aaaaand i am doing nothing but complaining, aren't i?  well, good news then.  hey guys...I'M A FAIRY!  in peter pan, that is...which is quickly approaching.  come, everyone, and observe my magic fairy skills.  and mckenna's excellent indian skills.  

whitney moves away in two weeks.  this sucks.  *sigh*

so, on a note of awkwardness and slight sadness, i bid you adieu.  in the infamous words of conan o'brien, keep it cool, mah babies.

WHEEEEEN will phantom of the opera come to owensboro??  i must see that movie, or i will die.  or sit around the house and pout and eat some reeses peanut buttercups and watch E! true hollywood story (johnny depp was on it today, rejoice!).  its really quite amazing how music can change your mood.  i really need to do that AP US history stuff..and THAT, ladies and gents, was my dose of randomness for the day.  

well, now that i'm acutally updating, i'm not sure what else to say.  new years resolutions, i suppose?  lets see...
     ::stop over analyzing/being paranoid about everything.
     ::stop obsessively stalking-i mean, looking up the eisley girls (pshaw, like THAT will happen..)
     ::stop complaining so much.
     ::get outside more.
     ::...uh...read the bible more?

there you have it.  most of them are ""stop doing this""s, but thats alright, i suppose.  goodnight you princes of marshmellows, you kings of lollipops.

"event","last week's events were so insane and dramatic that it makes this week just seem so sleepy.  speaking of sleepy, that's how i have been all week (you can ask all of the people in my government class who see me every once in a while sleepily raise my head from my desk, with random red marks all over my face).  

i'm Xtreme(thats right, XXXXXXXXcos i'm hardcoreXXXXXXX)-ly excited about the dances we're gonna learn and the choreographers we're gonna be taught by.  sam watson is coming in january, and he's doing a funny piece so it'll be awesome (he did whatchamahcallit and skat man), and then john leher (did ""here, now, in this eden"") is coming in feb and that SAME week, MARCUS IS COMING FOR PETER PAN.  thats right, kids, get ready for me to start naggin' yous about THIS performance...auditions are january 18th.  wow, thats soon.

today i came home and watched SNL on E! and just left it on that channel out of laziness to change it.  so, i ended up watching like a marathon of dr. 90210, which is actually an awesome show (in my eyes).  on the episodes i saw, this one girl got butt implants to help her modeling job, this muslim woman got something done with her girly parts to make her look like a virgin (that was sad...she was raped, but if her family found out that she wasn't a virgin, they would stone her to death...really), and there was this one episode where this woman had FOUR BOOBS.  yes, FOUR BOOBS.  it was weird.  then at the end of that one, the doctor was talking and then he starting sobbing, saying ""i'm....i'm..i'm going back to my people!""...it was touching.

so then i went to youth to listen to the most annoying person on earth, kandis bricket, scream and sing and then elbow me in the eye.  awesome.

well, i'm off.  lovey-dovey, leslie."

nutcracker-it came and went.  its so sad...even though i complain about it and all, i really wish it wasn't over yet.  it was so much fun and it went so fast...gah, i will really miss all of the seniors *begins to tear up*...ok, i'm stopping.

KYA-came back yesterday from 2 days of government...stuff.  at first (as in, the first night after we presented our bill for the first time), it seemed really shitty, but it turned out quite pleasurable.  even though i had no idea what i was doing half of the time.  but that makes it all the more fun, right?  riiight...

nodancethisweek,nodancethisweek,nodancethisweek.  i know i've already said it, but i just said it again.  three times.

its quite amazing how i am able to completely waste the day away.  still in my pjs.  havent showered, brushed my teeth (i'm sure you all were dying to know)...been sitting at the computer obsessively reading stupid stuff.  i DID however, burn some cds.  i'm so proud of myself now that i can figure out our cd burner. mckenna, i made you this awesome (well, at least i think its awesome) cd with tilly and the wall and MORE on it.  be excited, now.

ok.  i saw alfie last night and WOAAHHHHANVEIAVNWPEIG JUDE LAW IS SO FORKING HOT.  sorry, had to say it.  but, i mean, c'mon, where has he been all my life (yeeep, all 16 years of it..)?  his hair is the epitome of faux-hawk-loveliness (sorry, jesse lacey...you're just not quiiiite up to par with him) and the way he ties his scarf is neat.  so, the movie was him having a lotta sex.  heh, no...there was somewhat of a plot, i just dont feel like ranting on more...it was about him figuring out his life and whatnot WHILST having a lot of sex.  i mean, anyone with a pair of ovaries and a vagina would have appreciated this film.  EYE CANDY, NOW!!!

so last night was the halloween show in brandenburg.  it was lovely, despite my achey feet and itchy ears, which resulted in me not wearing my ghetto skank wig or my high heels.  hey, wearing a black slip with chucks is a great costume, right?  anyway, the amazing cassandra came and we partied down.  my ears are still ringing...it was so loud.  all i could hear of the people singing was ""YOW YOW YOOOOWWWWWW!"" but that doesn't matter, cos those boys had some sweet dance moves.  we decided against going to the after party, even though the last one i went to was quite possibly the best night of my life (c'mon, standing in 30 degree weather in the middle of a corn field somewhere near french lick indiana PROMISES for a good time).  

today i'm going to visit my grandma.  i call her mimi.  she's the coolest mimi in the world, even though everyone else think she's embarassing and crazy. 

everyone, be sure to see straylight run's new video for ""extentionalism on prom night"" on oven fresh tomorrow on fuse.  3 o'clock,i believe.  hey, i'm on the street team and since i am a lazy 16 year old and dont know what else to do, this is the most street team-y i can get.  woo.  

hope everyone had a nice halloween."

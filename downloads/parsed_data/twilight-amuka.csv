"event","Amazing how easy it is.

For years, I have fought only for Yamigakure. For years I have worn this mask and gone with these skills of mine to the darkness, and killed and killed for a greater killer...

I was confused when I saw Hayate with those Light ninja, when he should have been in the village. I was angry when he said he was leaving of his own will, tired I've what I'd given my life for.

But all he had to do was say 'Iruka' and 'Orochimaru.' Give me one reason to trust his decision and one person to turn at. It seems to me even now, that I should have hesitated, felt conflict, left him only grudgingly, if I at all. Am I stronger than expected, or weaker? For all there's beem to cloud my vision, training and duty and blood, it was easy to trust him, end part of my existence. There was my fight with Zabuza, that small awakening, and Orochimaru's lie, on the other side... but things would have been the same without them.  

Even in the deepest darkness, in this world of the mask, I can see otouto's face. That's all there is to it.


Now that I stop to think, I can only be thankful I did find them. What would have happened, had I not? Ugly things, certainly, when I discovered him in one village, or missing in the other.

Oh, and Orochimaru tore Zabuza in pieces. I don't think I wrote anything about that. But it hardly seems to matter... he lived, and he hated the man to begin with. I can't imagine it having any effect other than to solidify their relationship. And, as things are going, I will end up in opposition to both. To everyone, actually. I have fought the Light and will continue to do so for a while, but I can no longer call myself loyal to the Dark. It seems unlikely I'll live to see the end of this...

Well, that never mattered, did it?"

I can tell, because I don't feel anything. It should bring up that doubt from before, I think, or I should be angry at Zabuza-san for mentioning treachery. He is a person that seeks conflict and power, but I am not. I can agree that there are ways in which Orochimaru-sama is far from an ideal leader, but I know loyalty. I don't just know it, it is integral to who, what I am now. It is a foundation.

And he has dealt it a heavy blow, with little thought.

But I feel nothing, and know that can only be because my doubt is again to be absolved in battle. The fighting ahead, then, will not be trivial.

For that, I can almost be eager..."

Maybe for his it is a practical matter; things happen immediately, there is no appearance of dissent; it is easier to ask forgiveness than permission, especially when neither is truely needed.

But...

A warrior does not fight one who cannot defend himself.

...and it has been a long time since I have called myself a warrior. I swore my oath by our tradition, I took Hayate's place, and I therefore am a ninja, 'a butterfly that flies only in darkness.' A tool of our village.

And yet, that old ideal is why I'm here. This denial only affirms it...

"event","Our encounter with Gai has reversed our earlier trend of complete superiority over opposing forces. The inability of Zabuza and his team to defeat a single opponent demonstrates how vulnerable we are to simple chance, especially when striking military infrastructure, which is likely to be guarded or attended by high-level or numerous Light shinobi. However, wasting time on strikes of low long-term military value also leaves us vulnerable.

However, I think I've hit on a strategy that will greatly damage the Light while allowing us to avoid contact with concentrations of enemy strength. Ninja are mercenaries; their reputation and infrastructure depend on fufilling contracts.

When ninja villages lose contracts, they weaken quickly. And we can cause the Light to lose contracts very, very quickly by attacking their customers in the village. Not only will they lose income through the deaths of customers and the fear of potential customers, but their reputation as competent soldiers will be shattered by attacks carried out in their own village, the seat of their collective power. Disguising ourselves as mukenin of the Light will increase this impression of weakness, and hopefully lead to doubts over the political stability of the village as well.

It's a dirty way to fight... but that's what we were sent to do.

I will submit this plan to Zabuza-san and Shikamaru for review immediately."

<P>Unless it's working on you, then it's more like a soporific. I like the subtle kind. Most ninja are too strong of will to be completely taken in by genjutsu, even if you can latch on to some of their mind or spirit, they realize what's happening to them. What I use, just makes you miss a beat here, a thought there. It wins a battle&nbsp;just as well as&nbsp;terrifying visions of helplessness and the like.</P>
<P>I hate it, really. But I am kunoichi...</P>
<P>Zabuza-san had my team attack a power substation today. No transformers, no electricity for the hardworking light citizens. It was an easy task; ninja villages, by their nature, are not very dependent on technology; as a military target the value is low. I was a bit suprised to even have to fight for it. It was easy, of course, but I don't see why they'd post guards here at all- they're only good for a sense of security. The Light don't have&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;enough ninja to harden every position against a strong force like ours... as we've demonstrated. Genjutsu slows the enemy response, and blades put it to rest.</P>
<P>After that, we just wrecked the equipment and got out. The way we can be killed easily is in the response, where the opposition can apply their much-greater power to a single point.</P>
<P>I wonder how Zabuza-san did... water is likely to be a much better looked-after resource.</P>"

For that I'm glad; from the moment I was assigned the mission I've been constantly drilling my new squad. Zabuza-san and Shikamaru (he's a newly-minted chuunin, but apparently some sort of savant for tactics and planning) handled most of the strategic thinking, but I still had to make sure my own unit was battle-ready. Anbu are all supposed to be specialists in small-unit combat and tactics, the soldiers among ninja, but like me they had mostly been used for normal contracted missions lately, and needed to reintegrate.

Needed it badly, actually. We worked hard- I don't think I said even this many words to Hayate over it as little as I was in- but this is a huge mission, and we have no real combat experience as a squad. As with other types of experience it's not easily replaced by training, so it will likely be a disadvantage for us against the Light.

Of course, Zabuza-san says that we have the advantage in both individual talents and strategic initiative. And then there's Zabuza and I..."

I expected him to be at least as angry as he was over the last mission... then he had just been discontent with our style, but this was my first complete failure in a long time.

He immediately assinged me a new mission; to support Zabuza-san in an espionage and disruption mission against the Light in preemption to a full offensive. Apparently he's just come back to the village, and I returned at the right time to be assigned as his reinforcements... hopefully I'll have time to visit brother again before we redeploy.

Still... I'm glad. No more assassinations without any real opposing forces, no more being assigned low-rank missions because there's nothing bigger, no more shell games against inscrutable ninja organizations.

"event","Things have finished here rather suddenly...

I was watching over that tea shop when I finally spotted one of the Akatsuki members- Uchiha Itachi, lately of our own village, reportedly one of the stongest in the organization. He was alone, but it seemed likely that if he was there, he'd be meeting with someone... and I might finally learn something of substance about my quarry.

I hadn't been there more than a few minutes when I felt a presence behind me... and turned to see him. Itachi. I had obviously been watching a shadow clone... meaning either he had put it in his place without me noticing, or he had detected me before he had even reached the shop.

Well, I was still alive. It was a good start, as far as Plan B's go.

I looked at him and he looked at me. Perhaps for a second, but it could have been forever, tense as my mind was.

And then he told me I was pathetic at hiding. The commentary seemed strange coming so matter-of-factly, but I pressed on and simply went with my story, that I wanted to join the Akatsuki. He seemed incredulous (in the slimmest sense of the word) that I'd even attempt such a thing when I was so easily trapped by him, so I simply said that I did, and that he was supposedly one of the strongest members so his superiority oughtn't necessarily rule me out.

That didn't get me anywhere either. That I'd sought him out knowing of him and his power personally was even stranger... I answered that his was the sort of example that made me want to join the organization in the first place.

That at least got me a definitive answer... Akatsuki did not accept ""candidates,"" didn't bother to train weak ninja; it was simply a name for an alliance of those who were already strong enough to have each other's respect, and I wasn't at that level.

After that, there really wasn't anything useful left to attempt. I considered telling him that I'd taken care of that group that wished to destroy them, but given his attitude I doubted he'd be impressed by a person weaker than him destroying those weaker than her. His disinterest was clear, so attempting to interrogate would be useless at best, and probably suicidal. I just said I'd come back in a few years, which seemed like a good balance between offering the barest glimpse of possible future usefulness and not being annoying. He responded that I'd probably need more than a decade, and we went our seperate ways.

It seemed almost surreal, really. Here I was, talking to one of the most powerful ninja alive... and I said my part, and he said his. Like there was no tension in the situation, just in me.

But now that they're aware of me, I'm not going to wear out my doubtless-thin welcome by trying to learn anything more. I've met them, unfortunately on their terms, and they aren't inclined to let me into their confidence, so this mission is over.

Time to head home."

Anyay, he fell for the old ""disguise the primary trigger as a secondary counterline"" trick and set off the explosion notes I painted over on the doorjamb. An easy success, in the end.

Even better, I didn't even have to work the guy that hard for information. Cracked after the second round of genjutsu. Unfortunately, he says he has no association with Akatsuki... but he's part of some semi-competent gang of ninjas who are out to try to annihilate Akatsuki, and was going after me because, you know, I was acting like I wanted to join them. Apparently they don't realize just what they're dealing with... but what's important to me is that they've spent a lot of time figuring out HOW to do such a thing, and know a few places where Akatsuki members have been seen repeatedly- giving me the only good lead I've found on this mission.

"event","This mission is getting pretty hectic. Basically, I'm searching for information on a group of extremely powerful and reclusive ninja while hiding my identity as an elite ninja behind my cover identity of an overconfident average ninja.

Speaking of which, these guys have no idea how lucky they are to have me around. We've done 3 missions total and I've already had to ""scout ahead"" and wipe out some opposition that would have proven difficult if I'd just wandered into their ambush with my mukenin friends.

And that's just so I have a place to sleep inside city limits. Doing my actual work here, finding Akatsuki, has proven a more daunting task. According to rumor, which is all one can get since they have no known former members nor employers or contacts, they only complete contracted missions for information, and have been conjectured to have participated in several thefts and kidnappings. Basically, they work only for themselves. Those who work with them tend to either have a minimum of independently useless information, or end up dead. I've gotten visual descriptions of a few members, which has at least served to corroborate my initial info, but nothing like a location to contact them at.

So far I've put on airs like I think I'm good enough to join, stuff like that. Right now my best hope is that, in the manner of extremely well-connected people, they'll hear that I'm asking about them and check me out. Hopefully without immediately killing me. From what I've heard, they're the sorts that wouldn't have too much trouble.

Actually, there's this guy, definitely some sort of ninja, who's been following me around lately. Doesn't seem of the caliber to be part of their organization, but he could be somehow related. On the other hand, he could just be part of some mukenin gang- when missions are scarce this place tends to turn into one big turf war.

Well, that's all for today. Amuka out."

"event","<P>Alright,&nbsp; today my mission *really* began. After spending all of yesterday traveling, I reached the city of Kuroiiwa, famous as a hiring-place for mercenaries. Where better to find out about a group of mukenin, right?</P>
<P>The first thing I did, as I had decided when I received the mission, was to try to join a group of mercenary ninja. Much better to look for the targets from the position of a prospective member than a spy, plus my expense money is pretty limited. Unfortunately, all the groups that don't ask many questions and let people in quickly and easily are also pretty bad, it would seem. The first group I asked thought I was joking or something, I don't know if I was being too polite or they just thought they were better than me. I had better luck later in the day, and found a small team that was very down-to-earth and just did some basic competency tests and let me in. They're all pretty weak, but that means that leaving won't be a problem if they get possessive.</P>
<P>Since there wasn't any mission immediately at hand, I was able to spend some time in town asking about my quarry. Unfortunately, it appears that they don't openly&nbsp;accept mission requests and may take none at all, working only for their own advancement. This was only the result of one night's information-gathering, of course, but it already appears that my task will be a hard one.</P>"

Actually, that's kind of impressive, isn't it? Maybe Zabuza-san's destructive tendencies are rubbing off on me.

...honestly though, it's definitely bad, that something like that affected me so much, and I didn't even realize it. A ninja can't have extraneous stuff that they aren't aware and in control of floating around. Pride is especially dangerous...

Anyway, I just have to remember, what's done is done, the last mission was completed but not satisfactorily, I'll just do better on this one, make sure I fulfill all secondary and tertiary objectives, and restore my name.

Actually, I would think the deterrent value in our casual use of force would be desirable; I certainly can't see how we would stand to benefit from disguising our involvement. And besides, he should have known from our team's records that this kind of action is our MO. ""Silent killing"" or no, we still complete most of our missions by direct offensive means like ambush or raids. This, sending Gaara to rescue prisoners, sending Zabuza-san to turn some kid... it definitely makes me feel worried. And slighted.

"event","<P>Well, I'm back from my mission, another assassination.&nbsp;It was only B-rank, well below the capabilties of a B-format Anbu team.&nbsp;We were chosen on the basis of&nbsp;our knowledge of the&nbsp;target, a minor feudal lord two territories away from the Dark Village who had&nbsp;employed our team's services and was&nbsp;marked for assassination by the village itself&nbsp;for failure to&nbsp;pay his debts. There's something frighteningly stupid&nbsp;about hiring assassins you can't pay. Well, that or something we did for him was worth his life.</P>
<P>Anyway, we left around midday yesterday, giving us enough time to take a look around the keep in preperation&nbsp;for a night raid. There aren't a lot of ways for jounin to lose to common soldiers,&nbsp;but neglecting their&nbsp;advantage in information-gathering is a good start.&nbsp;At nightfall, I went in. It wasn't very elegant- I went over the wall without being seen, had a shadow clone kill a few guards and lead the bulk of them&nbsp;to the other end of the courtyard, and then followed the one who went to warn the target. He went straight to a big study on the third floor, but&nbsp;the corridors approaching the&nbsp;door were&nbsp;all choked with guards, so&nbsp;I used henge to disguise myself as a guard, went around to an adjacent room, and made myself a nice&nbsp;passage&nbsp;with Dance of the&nbsp;Waxing Moon. As I had expected, he was gone- the mass of men outside had made it pretty clear that he'd gotten wind of what was happening long before that messenger made it there. Of course, my lack of discretion hadn't been accidental. I took out the first few men who rushed in with shuriken and used genjutsu to immobilize enough that the rest couldn't rush the door for while I found the enterence to the&nbsp;secret passage, then dropped in and started running.</P>
<P>I found most of our target with Zabuza-san. Apparently&nbsp;he'd&nbsp;had a few men leading and had been spared my traps, but they'd still fufilled their secondary purpose of taking out the lighting. They'd probably have been better off just getting killed by an exploding note,&nbsp;my teammate&nbsp;has hunting people in zero visibility pretty much down to an art form, and he can be a bit more sadistic than necessary sometimes.</P>
<P>Hmm...&nbsp;since this is a journal, maybe I should comment on the mission.&nbsp;Our execution&nbsp;was very unsubtle, but me and Zabuza-san are a combat team and the mission was below our level, so it made sense to just get it over with.&nbsp;Fighting my way in and&nbsp;ambushing him&nbsp;as he attempted to escape&nbsp;was easier than sneaking in and risking being surrounded, especially since they were expecting us. </P>
<P>Well, I guess I should write my formal report for Orochimaru-sama now,&nbsp;there's no point in&nbsp;having completed&nbsp;the mission quickly&nbsp;if I don't file as soon as I return. After that I'll rest, and then visit Hayate and see about finding Zabuza a better place to stay. Maybe one with no immediate neighbors.</P>

Yes, I've written a lot of mission reports in here before, but Hayate said he was going to start writing a personal journal so I decided I'd give it a try too. Especially since my team hasn't been involved in this latest little crisis and it's been just a bit monotonous... </P>
<P>...Zabuza-san says I shouldn't use the issued nin-info cards for personal notes. </P>
<P>Well, it's not really his place to say, and besides, some people <EM>like Kabuto</EM> have millions of them. Unfortunately for this first entry, very little of&nbsp;importance has happened to me recently- but that's why I'm writing, isn't it? </P>
<P>Hayate told me earlier that he found a man who'd been mugged out in town. The criminal element must be getting brave or desperate to mug passerby at random... that or they've gotten good at discerning plainsclothes ninja. The village used to seem like a nicer place, but that could just be nostalgia... especially for me. The time before Hayate caught that damned illness has always...</P>
<P>...shit. That sounded like Zabuza's sword taking out one of my walls again.</P>
<P>...it was&nbsp;the&nbsp;floor this time. I think it knocked out&nbsp;power&nbsp;to the apartment below me... and all it did was fall off my sword rack. All my scabbards are fine, though.</P>
<P>While Zabuza-san is a great teammate, otherwise he's&nbsp;not always the best person&nbsp;to be around.&nbsp; ""Soldiers at peace are&nbsp;truly the most dangerous thing in the world-"" and he pretty much defines himself as a soldier. And he just has a&nbsp;short temper and a lot of pride. Actually, he's here right now because him and some upstart jounin got in a fight over something trivial and ended up&nbsp;leveling their whole housing development. I've asked him why he doesn't go out and practice so these things won't happen, but&nbsp;I think he&nbsp;takes it as an insult to his ability...</P>
<P>...I would have liked to see a Water Dragon effect manifest out of the plumbing, though. I don't have much talent or appreciation for that sort of&nbsp;tactical ninjutsu, but flashiness when it results&nbsp;from ingenuity and skill is always worth respect. </P>
<P>Anyway, Zabuza-san is saying something about a mission, and I'd like to get&nbsp;that sword&nbsp;out of here, so I guess I'm off to do what I do best. When I get back I should have some things of my own to write instead of just reporting on my teammate and brother. Will write again soon.</P>"

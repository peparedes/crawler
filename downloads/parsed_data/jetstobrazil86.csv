So there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me... I am blind without a cause
And now I realize what I have <i>lost</i>

Why?

Anyway, I was sitting in the newly dubbed ""Shiigg"", and it was dark, and I had a few beers in me.  Jim started talking about his coming down from his high, and I started to think.  All of the sudden, I hit somewhere I'd never been before.  In a dark room, with Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"" playing, I felt something that was in indescribable.  I went from the highest high of happiness in my life to the lowest low that I've ever felt.  I went back and forth, it was like a struggle in my mind.  I went from ready to fucking cry, to smiling uncontrollably half a dozen times, just thinking about everything that's happened in my life.  I wish I would have been able to stay there, it was amazing.  I honestly felt like I was on another fucking planet.  I didn't want to come home.  I want to go back there, it was just unbelieveable.  It also confirmed a lot of shit that I realized in the last couple days.  I don't want to talk about a lot of the things I've come to figure out, but they're all fucking true.  My outlook on how shit works is totally different than how it used to be.  I just wish I could go back to where I was.  It was just, amazing.

I came up to Oswego, where I still am, on the account I still need a couple hours before I go driving anywhere, to just not think about anything and just not myself.  In the end, I was more like myself last night than I've been in a long time.  It may have something to do with, as my friends call it, ""liquid courage"", but I was just myself.  I was shy, but I said all the stupid things that I'd expect myself to say when I was drunk.  I made fun of kids twice my size, I said things to girls that I certainly would never say sober, and I acted like a total fuck up, but I was still me more than... ever.  I met a lot of cool people last night.  I mean, I did start drinking at like 7, and didn't get back until 4, so I had a lot of time, but I had more fun last night than any night I've had at Clarkson.  In the end, I still would have gone with my other option, had it been available, but since it wasn't, I'm glad I came up here.  I left a lot of details out, so if you want to know, just ask, I just wanted to get the emotional garbage out, before I forget it.

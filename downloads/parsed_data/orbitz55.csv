"event","Hi everybody,

I don't post often since I've moved from Gainesville to Atlanta, but I came back to post just one thing.

Regardless if Gainesville is a bike-friendly city or not, I believe that bikers and pedestrians need to be more careful and watch out for each other. The same applies to bikers and car-driving-peoples. This is coming from a former biker. I biked everywhere in Gainesville where possible.

I will preface this by saying that my mother loves to walk. She walks everywhere. We come from an enviromentally friendly family. My mother was walking on the sidewalk today on W. University Ave and got hit (""run over"" was the term she used, lol) by a bicyclist. Both fell to the pavement. My mother is in her mid 50s and sustained some injuries in an area where she has sustained injuries in the past.  Basically she is in a lot of pain. According to my mother, the biker was 'speeding' and didn't really make efforts to move while on the sidewalk. This is a biased point of view, but all I know is what she said. She called me very upset and crying which is very unlike her usual calm self, which just made me more worried and made me want to post about this more. 

I'm not here to point fingers or rant about how my poor mother was injured, but I thought I'd just let everybody know to be more careful while biking, abide by biking laws, pedestrians be more aware of bikers, use crosswalks, yada yada yada as this situation has really broken my heart and made me insanely worried about her well being."

Hi ladies! I'm selling this Coach East-West Fuschia/Pink Demi because it simply does not get enough use. I actually purchased it from sell_your_bag, and I'm selling it back on this community again. It has barely been used and only has a small pen mark (dot) on the strap that is barely noticeable.  Please refer to the pictures. It's super clean inside and has only been used a handful of times. Mini skinny is not included, sorry!

I am currently accepting offers, so please email noveda4u@gmail.com with your offer as I barely use LJ. THANKS!

"event","I'm a little nervous about posting. All my entries thus far are private. There's something about public blogging that seems a little exhbitionistic (is that even a word? ugh) that makes me nervous about the concept of making my feelings and thoughts public. It takes a lot for me to even form proper sentences, let alone having the Internet judge me on the way I formulate my emotions. 

I walk on campus a lot and think about things to write. I would have to say this is a daily occurrence. I often watch people and random subjects/ideas will come to my mind and I say to myself ""This would be a good thing to write about."" I don't mean necessarily my LJ - but just write in general. It's sad that our society has progressed so much toward the keyboard as a means of writing, but I have to admit that using a pen and notebook to write anything (not just your inner thoughts) is a thousand times more therapeutic (to me). There's something about using your own hands and taking time to form words and sentences with your writing instrument that holds itself apart from using a computer. I myself can't and refuse to write with a notebook and a pen - I feel that typing is much faster and more efficient. But with regard to matters of the heart, a hand-written journal should be the way to go. But it's not (as evident by this blog).

So I'm going to try and write in this journal everyday. I probably won't. But it's a good start (to try) and seems like a good outlet for my creativity (lol) and random everyday emotions.

Here's to my first public post. I wonder who reads this. I know I have one friend (hello to you!)."

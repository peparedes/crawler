"event","Okay well... -_-;
I made a ghetto bun for my Hinamori cosplay, I hope I don't look too bad. I am fucking nervous. Tomorrow I'm going as my own shinigami. God. I just am so... BOUNCY. XD I am like dancing around like a crazy moron. Anyway~ I have some extra time to kill before I have to go. So I thought I would update to let everyone knows what's up. Hehehe. I can't wait to cosplay. Hopefully I'll meet a very cute Hitsugaya [Who isn't taken] and I could be with him. *___* And when next year comes I'll ditch him for Emma. ROFL. XD 

Lots of loves,
Mandy."

"event","Oh my god. I feel so scared yet excited at the same time. I am scared when I cosplay because I don't have my Hitsugaya-kun with me, she couldn't make it but she will be there next year. I am like... Freaking out because I am scared to death. This will be my <b>first</b> con after all.

Well... I just woke up and I am still pretty damn sleepy. I just can't wait to cosplay. I gotta make a ghetto bun tonight. -_-; I dunno if my sister finished mine or not. I gotta call her tonight. 

GAHHH! I want my Hitsugaya-kun. T___T I feel really scared without her. I mean, we were suppose to be going together, but I guess it's best if I be a big girl and go by myself. Well... Kind of. o.o; My step sister will be joining me, but she's not gonna cosplay. So yeah. XD"

Why doesn't <b>anyone</b> ever fucking listen to me?! I tell them something once and they ignore it. I am <b>not</b> going to repeat myself for you or anyone damn else. I swear I hate it when the person doesn't get it once, but it fucking <b>piss me off</b> when they don't get it the <b>third</b> time. How many fucking times do I have to tell you till you fucking get it? But you know there is a <b>bright side</b> to this. Everytime I'm right I love it say:

<b>""HAHAHA, BITCH! I TOLD YOU SO!""</b>

I love to rub it in their face. I wanna laugh my fucking ass off. When will you people realize that I am <b>always</b> right. And if you don't think I am, then name <b>one</b> fucking time that I was <b>ever wrong</b>. Hard isn't? Not even my in real life ex could think of a time and I spent more time with him then these e-drama bitches online.

Today I went to the doctor with my <b>mom</b> and she has a fucking bad habit for saying stuffs out loud. She yelled out in a different language, <b>""Why are your teeth yellow?""</b> in front of all of these Lao people. I was like... Omg. Kill me now. So I pinched her really hard. And then later [10 mins later] I asked her if I can get that pink top. And she's like... <b>""No, it won't fit you. It's an XS.""</b> Once again... She said it <B>OUT LOUD</b>. I was like... Omg. Wtf? I AM A <B>SMALL</B>. <B>SMALL</B>. <B>SMALL</B>. <B>SMALL</B>!!! I CAN <B>SOME TIMES</B> FIT INTO A FUCKING XS. IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL ME. IT'S NOT LIKE I'M XXL, BITCH!

And then we went to the mall and I kept telling her it's a waste of time to buy pants because I'm like... <B>Deformed</b>. O_o;... I am small on top [Because I'm fucking flat chested.] But I am fat at the bottom. My hips are HUGE and disgusting. But on top I look skinny. [This is why I only take head shots]. So we spent about an hour or so and I'm like... <B>DEAD TIRED.</b> I told her at least <b>10 fucking times</b> that <b>NOTHING</B> is going to fit me. WHY DON'T SHE GET IT?! AM I SPEAKING SPANISH?! I spoke in both <b>Lao AND English</b> at least 3 times each. I am fucking tired.

So she was dragging me to <b>another</b> shop and I just walked away. I am fucking sick of listening to her. I am tired of people <b>never</b> listening to me. WHY DON'T EVERYONE LISTEN TO ME FOR FUCKING ONCE. At least I get to rub it in your fucking face once you guys are wrong. Kthx.

Yes, I can be a <b>bitch</b> but I don't give a damn. People make me angry. Just fuck off and <b>die</b>."

Last night I felt like all the stress left my body and all I want to do is cry and be happy. I feel so much better compare to the shitty two weeks I been having. I just want to cry and scream and dance around.

<b>Emma and I made up!</b>

I know it's like... WTF?! But Emma is my <b>best friend</b> and I would feel really lost without her. I just want to cry and scream and run up to her and hug. Her family was stressing about AX, so we decided next year. We'll try again. [Of course I'm going this year, though. <b>PAKU ROMI</b>!]

We were talking about the HitsuHina cosplay we're going to do next year. It's pre-shinigami day where she'll be <i>Shirou-chan</i> and I'll be <i>Bed Wetter Momo</i>. And last night we felt like all our stress just washed away. We were looking at HitsuHina pictures and we thought... Looking at that couple it's just... Sad without the other, you know?

We should thank Rei for lending us her wisdom buuutttt~ Knowing Rei, she would charge us. And knowing us, we would go to her every 5 days. T_T;.... So we'll be fucking <b>poor</b>. So that's why we're not telling Rei. << >>;;... Shh.

Anyway, I feel like drawing a HitsuHina picture so I'll update later again. It's still pretty damn early. @_@;"

"event","Well... Let's see. 
My name is Mandy aka Seiikou. o_o;
I am 16 years old and uhh... I'm Asian? ^^;
I &hearts; cosplaying and PAKU ROMI.

This is an IRL picture of me:
<img src=""http://myspace-817.vo.llnwd.net/00645/71/85/645275817_l.jpg"" />

Um... Yeah. I have very emo-rific hair, don't I? But I am <B>NOT</B> Emo.
I just love the hair... Like whoaz. <3

Okay... Um. If you wanna get to know me, just leave me some message or some crap. o_o

Well let's start with this... @_@;
AX is like... This Saturday, but I am going to LA on Friday.
Point is... Me = Stressed out.
But luckily I have my little sister, Christina to be there to support me.
She is making me Hinamori Momo's bun for my cosplay, since this year she isn't gonna cosplay.
Anyway~ The point is I am stressing myself out on <i>purpose</i>.
I want to push my period back another month. 
Is this safe? @_@; 
I mean... I have skipped months before, due to stress.
But those weren't on <i>purpose</i> like this <b>time</b>.

Anyway... I think that's good for now. I'll update more when I become unlazy."

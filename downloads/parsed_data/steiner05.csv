"event","well let me tell you, there is no fun in getting into a car accident and hitting deer. never want to do that again. i'm so pissed that i can't drive my car for awhile now. it still runs which is good. but i have to get a new front windshield and a driver window and need a new mirror on the driver side and need to pop the dent back out so i can open my door. and now i am going to be stuck at home doing nothing till it gets fix. went to stacey's graduation party on saturday. mostly played cards and talked. and then when i was going home was when i hit the deer. it's almost june. and for the rest of this week its finally suppose to be at least 70 degrees outside, which is awesome."

"event","well i am finally graduated. it feels so good not to be in that hell hole. i mean most of the teachers and some of the kids weren't idiots. but for some others thats a different story. school wouldn't be that bad if they had the right teachers and the administration. anyways graduation was good. even though i think i was the first one to cry, but it was only when katie was singing a song by herself. i knew i was going to cry too. oh well. at least i think i got a few other people to tear up. ha. nothing really going on for me at the moment. tomorrow i go to stacey's graduation party, and then sunday i am most likely going to the phillip's graduation. i hate this weekend, cuz its memorial weekend and everybody that is a anybody comes up to their cabins or whatnot and its so crowded. i just try to stay confined to my house. i only leave if necessary. ha. i might even write in this journal a little more often now that school is over, and that i have no life. well i best be going now."

"event","i hate when people assume things. why don't they ask before they assume, or don't even say it at all. people are lucky that they like never go to school or a certain class and still get a good/decent grade. that just pisses me off. where i am almost always there and get a bad grade. i can't take most people anymore. i am so glad that i am out of high school in not to long. hopefully some of the people in college wouldn't be this bad. graduation is almost here.

"event","well today sucked. first mr kief's stupid talk. i still have 2 more days i think left, so i'm good for now, but i seriously think he should start it all next year. theres no point of starting it now. then mr pask changed all of the computers so they are actually updated but now they seem more complicated. in american literature we had to read, which is kind of sucks cuz i can't really concentrate anymore, especially when people talk. in band the 2nd half people just whined. i have never in my life throught this year in high school have seen so many high schoolers whine. its really getting bad. and its about the stupidest things too. and algebra 2, people are so damn loud. and it bugs me, cuz if i yell at them i know they will be pissy or wouldn't listen to me. and they whine so much in that class too. if i got a doller for every time i heard anybody whine i would be fricken rich. i guess not to much else. just has been a crummy da today. 30 days left of high school. and i have even less cuz of trips i am going on. hell yes."

"event","well i'm 18!! it was an ok birthday. had kind of a bad cold, for the fourth year in a row. the best thing i got for my birthday was a gift card for gas at bp, which is definately good since gas went up today. yesterday i went with stacey and heather to watch the pacifier. i haven't been to a movie theater since i was in 9th grade, so it was nice to go. i got the prettiest flowers too. they are kind of like tropican looking. i love the blue ones. now i will be able to vote next month for the school board and what not, which is great because they need some good people on there. 

after i got back from our skills-usa trip i got a rejection letter from uw-stevens point. but then that saturday i got an acceptance letter from uw-superior. so i am going to at least start out at superior, which isn't all that bad cuz i have relatives up there. 

i guess there is not to much else going on lately. i have just been busy with work and school and running around and what not. it's been along time since i actually wrote on this thing but i finally updated it."

"event","i can't beleive that school has started. summer went by so damn fast. it sucks. but at least this is my last year at high school. first day of school sucked so bad. it was just a really bad day. and i tried changing my schedule a little. not really change it but add another class to be split with band. and of course i couldn't. that was the quickest i have been in and out of the guidance counselor room. about a minute. so my schedule stays the same.

1st-government
2nd-2-d/3-d art
3rd-yearbook 
4th-physics
5th-computer app.
6th-american lit.
7th-band
8th-algebra 2

i guess my schedule isn't that bad. except for government that early in the morning. 

volleyball has been going ok. except for he basically just leaves the same people in. me and ashley didn't get to play at all. but i'm happy with the team. i don't have much to say about those spandex though. 

i haven't wrote in this for over a month. i tried writing when i got back from boundary waters but it was being stupid and wouldn't let me. boundary waters was pretty fun. only rained the first day when we were going out there. didn't really hang out with any of the girls in my group though. talked with the leaders though. they are really cool. i guess next year we are going on a different lake or different route. something like that. some of the highlights of the trip were:

-mud portage
-portaging a canoe (i have no balance what-so-ever)
-that damn wind when we were trying to head back, there was freakin white caps
-some guys singing us brittany spears, while some of their group went back to their campsite to get a water bottle they forgot
-moose with only two legs
-dressing up
-the moose carcass
-o-s-c-a-r m-A-y-e-r-
-our spam talk
-our short-cuts that we took where i had to get out and pull
-me falling in the lake while trying to get in the canoe
-and lots more

i can't wait to go next year. i just wonder who will be going next year, and if we will have two girl groups. its such a blast. i love it up there. if i go next year i hope its like last year. nice and warm and sunny the whole time. i need to get out and start meeting people i think. or do something with friends. well i guess this is enough writing for now."

"event","i don't think to much has been going on with me. it is now august, and school starts in less then a month. i went to the dentist and i get my braces off in october. finally after 2 and a half years of them. i will probably have to get my grad pictures with them still on though. 

entered some stuff in the fair. did pretty good. i basically just entered pictures i took. i even entered in the open class which is mostly adults that enter in. and theres only 4 ribbons in each catagory, and i only had 2 that didn't place. i even got a best of show in art. saw a few friends at the fair. talked to one of my friend's dad, who i haven't seen in a while, which was nice. that family is one of the few families that i like everybody in. he told me something like i guess that your a senior this year. and i said yea. and my friend told him i didn't act like one. but then he said well i think she does. i felt better after he told me that. he also wished me luck for the future. 
 
i leave for boundary waters in a week from today. in a way i am scared that im not going to be strong enough. i went last year, and kind of got hurt. nothing serious. hopefully nothing like that will happen this year. and i'm in a group of girls that are all from hayward and i am the only one from winter. i know them and all, i just hope i don't feel out of place at any point.

i miss alot of people, that i wish i could see more of them. but i doubt i can. and then theres people that i wish i could get to know more of them."

"event","i am going to try and get an appointment for getting my grad pictures taken. i know i have been slacking off in that department. and i am kind of nervous to get them taken cuz i know they will look like crap. 

can you beleive school is a little over a month away. i still can't beleive i'm a senior and this is my last year. my brother came home for a little bit before he went on vacation with my dad, and when he was getting his hair cut he was talking to somebody and they reminded that i was a senior this year. he can't beleive it either. 

well volleyball camp is over now. in a way i'm glad cuz i'm sore, not as much as i was after the first day. i didn't go today cuz i babysat this morning, and was just out of it this afternoon and wanted to see my dad before he left since i never get to see him anymore it seems like. he went to canada last thursday came home on tuesday night, left today and is not coming home till monday night. it seems like i don't see him alot this summer. which kinda sucks. and one of the weekends when he might be finally home i will be in boundary waters. go figure.

i helped my sister clean her room today cuz she was having a friend over (ok i didn't help her, she wasn't even there, i cleaned it myself) and i found a envelope with my name on it. so i opened it and it was a card with $10 in it. so when i saw my sister i was like why did you take that, stop taking my stuff. and she said something like i was a little kid, and i told her it was from valentines day so you were only about 5 months younger then you are now. little kids i tell you. then she tried to go in my room and take it. 

these weeks are going by so fast. it seems like i just cleaned cabins and now i have to do it again in a day and a half. sometimes it seems like life goes by fast. especially when you don't really want it to.

well maybe i will start writing in my journal more. maybe...."

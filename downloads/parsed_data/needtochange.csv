Yesterday I went out for shopping and I found a wonderfull dress to wear on my bf's birthday party on saturday. But I'm not sure If I want to show my legs because  it's quite short. I tried it with leggings but I'm no sure because my calves are also to fat... Another solution would be to wear it with jeans but he'll see that it's because I don't want to show my legs and we'll have and endless discussion again about ""you're not so fat, don't hide, blabla""...
BUT I AM FAT !!! 
He doesn't understand... 

Anyway, I ate nothing so far today and that's good. 

But another matter is that my exams are next week and the week after and I'll have to concentrate so I should eat more but eating more during 2 weeks will make me gain sooo much weight...
I just don't know how to manage all that things..."

1st of all, I want to spend great summer holiday in a warm country, on a beach.
2nd : I have enough of seing my friends going to the swimming pool together. I always has to find sthg so that I don't need to go with them because I'M TOO FAT.
3rd reason : I promised it to my boyfriend. His quite skinny himself, we can see his bones at some parts of his body : his just beautifull. And very kind with me, because he said that he didn't mind if I was fat... But I know that he would be happier if I would be thin. I would be happier.

So I'm not going to binge : I'll take a shower and sleep and STAY AWAY FROM FOOD.

Today I'm starting again, because I need it again. 
A lot of things have changed in my life, in better. I feeld good during a very long period of time. But now school has started again, and a few of my worries are back : stress, lot of work, far away from my friends-family-boyfriend, with people that i don't especially like... I eat too much again. 
So, I have got to care again, and this journal will help me.  

The binge eating came back 4 weeks ago. My boyfriend kissed another girl... I had nobody around me to help me, so i turn on food... And now, i cannot stop eating.
I weight 67kg 4 weeks ago, and now i weight 71kg. I let you see how i failed ; 1 kg per week. I'm so ashamed. 

But today is my last day of being fat. 
Tomorrow i'll start my 500cals per day diet that worked so good.

Today my weight (after eating soooooo much) is 71kg (155 lbs).
So my short term weight is 65kg (143 lbs)until the end of november.
My long term goal is 60kg (132 lbs) or 55kg (121 lbs) if i still feel too bad in my body.
my height : 1m78 (5.8 feeds).

"event","Hello !

I just woke up and I didn't sleep well... 
I feel hungry now, but i'm not going to eat anything until 1pm.
I weight myself : 72.9 kg ! I lost 600 gram. That's allright if I think about the amount of food that I take in yesterday...
I decided to go to gym this afternoon, after school (the last week of school!!!) I may burn 600 cals with the stepper (in France we call that machine a stepper...) 

It's strange, I lost 3 kg since I started but I don't know where they left... I mean my jeans are still too small and my ass (!) is still enormous.
maybe if i reach 65 kg it will get smaller : I HOPE

I'm going to leave for school now.



Today :
Weight : 72.9
Cals : now, 8.55am : 00"

"event","Just one precision : Sundays are going to be very hard to fast, i spend all the day with my parents and they are used to eat a lot, so they don't expect me to eat nothing. 
That's why I decided to eat 3 times maybe with a snack. To equilibrate i'll eat the less I can on mondays.

Ps : I really want o weight myself, but i'm to scared that it will make my mood down... i think that i'll let it be.

Ohhhhhhhhhh i'm really sick of everything now"

"event","OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK !

I ate normally today... I feel quilty now.
My jeans are soooooooo small for me and i let mysekf eat... I'm so silly.
i'll go to bed now and sleep, so i'll forget all my fucking mistakes.

Today :
weight : 73.5 kg
cals : about 1000 : unbelievable, i started so well ! 

I don't want to weight myself now... I'm going to be more depressed if i do it.
I'm sure that I took 1 kg back now.
I can't stand my dumb thinks anymore
And that's exactly the matter : I WANT TO CHANGE, I NEED TO CHANGE (I'll turn crazy otherwise!!!)
but I always can't hinder myself doing think that have no sense and that makes other people seeing me as a weak

Good night now."

I just spoke with my best friend at the telephone... 
She said that we can make purchases together but before she has got to drive her boyfriend at home... I don't want to see him... it isn't that i don't like him, but i've never really spoken with him (he's german and i don't like to speak german, because i think my german is bad... 
I don't like to be with a couple, i always feel alone and sad.. I DON'T WANT THAT
but I can't say no because she always laughs at me because i'm so timid... I HATE THAT
And she is so thin, and i'm so fat... i don't know what to wear to hide my fat.......
I'd like to hide somethere........
it's strange ! the first thing I thought about was to eat something ! it's always like that if i'm botherd....

"event","Hello !

I'm doing very well today !
It's sunny outside and I really enjoy it, I hate winter, I'm always so depressed...
Today I don't have school, so I stay at my parent's home until monday.
This afternoon I have to drive my grandmother to the doctor. She always want me to eat, I can't stand it anymore and I always get angry with her... If she wants to buy me some food, I'll bring it to my father, he will eat it up without problem. 

today I decided to eat one portion of spinach pie that my mother made. I don't really know haw many cals it has.. Maybe 150 ???
this eavening I'll surely eat one cup of Dole peaches : 45 cals, and one blackberry 0% fat yogurt : 57 cals. 
That makes : 252. That's alright. 

But I don't feel light, I feel heavy and full.. I don't understand why...


Yesterday :
weight : 76 kg
calories : about 500 : vegetables, yogurt, 2 slice of bread.



Today : 
weight : 75 !!! ( I know, it goes quickly the first 3 or 4 days, but after if you don't care, all the kilos are coming back... I must be carefull)
calories : now : 11.02am : O"

Today is my first day fasting. I woke up at 7am and I didn't eat anything. I must go to school at 12.30am, so I think that I'm going to eat some vegetables before leaving home because I've got an exam this afternoon. It may be better to take something to be more able to concentrate later. I don't really know what is better to eat... cereals ? bread ? meat ? vegetables ? fruits ? ... 
The most important thing to do for me now, is to find something to do, overwhise I'll think about food, and that is very BAD ! 
The last 2 days I ate a lot. NOW IT IS ENOUGH ! IT IS OVER !

"event","So...on Wednesday morning my boss informed all of us that she is retiring on March 31st. So, that means that I will work harder than ever to get a different job. I will not be at the library without her and this will give me the nudge I need to find a different job.  I was hesitant because I love the library, but now I can leave in peace.

I'm really sad about all of this and could use some time to get over it.  I adore my boss and working at the library, but now I can move on and feel really great about it.

I hope you all had a great Thanksgivin"

"event","So...I didn't get the job at the ARC.  Shoulda known that would happen.  I'm used to the rejection, but since they only interviewed one other person besides me I'm taking it especially hard.  I had a 50% chance of getting the job and still didn't get it.  I feel really great about myself right now.

Also, I'm upset for my bro because he worked really hard at being prepared for the fall play audition and he didn't get a part.  I'm really fucking sick of ""I'm a bastard named Ron Jenkins"" being so damned political about everything.  Granted it is only a three person cast, but he cast someone who I can't understand a word he is saying onstage but because he's the damn president or vice-president or something he gets the freakin' part!  He always did this to me too, and I'm so sick of his ""visions"" of the way the cast should be!  It's sickening that you have to be one of his ""henchmen"" or an ""officer"" to get a part at all.  So Nick is forced to be Student Director which is just a glorified term for the gofer of the whole mother fucking play!  You can mess with me but don't mess with my brother!  I'm really tempted to give that prick a piece of my mind.

***okay, rant over...moving on...deep breath in, slowly let it out***

So...I could use some encouragement right now.  Because I was sick last week I didn't go to therapy and now I can't get my therapist to return my phone calls so I can't get a new appointment.  AHHHH! I need someone to bitch and complain to.  I'm going crazy!!!!  I'm seriously having major breakdowns about things.  I was almost crying because I was so upset for my brother.  I can't stand that good people always get the shaft, and now Sara won't be able to see my brother on stage yet again.  Mother Fucker!!!"

I can probably stay at the library (according to the lady who interviewed me,) but I don't know what I want anymore.  The job is at the ARC here in Galena, and I would be the Preschool assistant and working with the Kids Club after school.  It sounds really lovely...but moving on is hard.  Keep me in your thoughts on that one.

Otherwise, everything is fine.  I've nothing new to report at this time.  I am feeling a little better, and hope to stay that way.

The trip was fun.  We had a great time, even though it was bastardly hot out there.  It did make the weather here seem like nothing however, so some good came of it.

I feel crappy right now.  Every time I eat I get really bad stomach pains and I'm thinking maybe an ulcer?  I'm dying?  Food betraying me?  Any thoughts from my lj pals out there???

So, my stomach hurts so bad that I don't eat, and then I feel kinda weak all day because I don't eat.  But the alternative is extreme stomach pain and feeling like I'm gonna barf all the time.  

AHHHHHHH!!!

Anyway, hope to see my wayward friends soon."

It has been fun, but I'll be glad when it is over.  I can't believe we leave for our trip in less than a month!  Mandy, get ready for some wild phone calls when we are there!  Let us know when you will be home and we'll call you lots so that it feels like you are there!

Teresa, Sara and I desperately want to get out for some fun sometime this week, so if you do go to the show on Saturday we would really like to maybe do something afterwards.  Maybe a late dinner or ice cream or something.

The show is really cute, and I think everyone who comes will enjoy it.

"event","So...last night was the library sleepover for the summer reading program.  It was interesting to say the least.  We had about thirty kids here and two to three teen advisors and me here at a time.  The kids were really wild, but we still had fun.  It took them forever to fall asleep, and I ended up not spending the night because every single child slept upstairs, and it was just too noisy for me (I really need to get over this soon.)  I left about 12:30 or so and Cody was here over-seeing the few kids that weren't yet totally asleep and then he too was going to go home.  Alison, Aubreigh and Janet all fell asleep almost immediately and so it left just me to watch all of the kids.  I probably made something like 100 trips up and down the stairs last night with various children and stuff, so today it feels like I ran a marathon or something.  I am really exhausted even though I slept until almost 9:30.  I didn't go to sleep right away when I got home, because I was very wound up.

Anywho, the kids had a great time and we didn't have any get homesick (except one who was only here for twenty minutes.)  It was a huge success!"

I'll have to pay it back of course, but I won't have to bust my ass trying to fund the trip all at once! I can pay her back in installments instead!!  I figure I will only have to come up with a couple hundred more to really have my bases covered.  I figure airfare/condo will cost about $385 and then maybe $300-$400 for spending money.  I won't to make sure I have enough in case something happens.

My job is driving me nuts right now...mainly because I'm not there enough and they are giving me enough work to last several weeks,a dn I just won't get to a lot of it until...well, I'm not sure I will get to it!  Ivo (my dad's boss) says he may have a job for me to do until I can get something more permanent!  That would be fantastic!  I know he needs helps getting products priced, so that should keep me busy for awhile.

I agreed to take Makayla tomorrow without thinking that I have therapy smack dab in the middle of my time with her.  I missed last week because Cathy was sick, and I could cancel this week but I'm going to see if she has anything else open.  I am sometimes such an airhead...and then other times I'm the only one on top of things.  Ay, ay, ay...

Teresa, I will be done covering lunches at 1:30 on Friday, so if you want to do stuff, great.  Sara isn't able to purchase tickets with us this weekend because she is going to Grinnell, but maybe we can order them for her and she can have the money there for us.  I have to cater Saturday night, but Friday I am free after 1:30 (as I stated already.)

Can't wait to see you all next week.  Are we planning something on Friday? Sunday? Monday?  My days are filling up, so please, let's try to get some definitives laid out."

It kinda stinks because I do not have enough time to get all of my work done, and while they want to be able to give me more hours, they claim it ""isn't in the budget"" so I guess that is just how it will be.  

I'm going to apply for a couple more jobs today (secretarial, since the hours are ideal) and then see where that gets me.  

Nothing new going on here really, but the weather is starting to upset me, mainly because of all the rain.  We have a party planned for my father on Saturday, rather our friends the Feece's do, and we are hoping it isn't going to rain because they planned for it to happen outside.  They are throwing him a party in honor of his new job and whatnot.  I'm excited; it should be fun.

Well, gotta go write a cover letter (if I can remember how to do one) and get my resume off.

He checked all the necessary stuff, ie: heart rate, blood pressure, my thyroid and signs of diabetes, and they are all normal.  His best guess is that I am just unlucky, and some factors that most people tolerate, like extreme temperature, getting up from a sitting/laying position, are hard for me to handle.  He said that fainting at my age is perfectly normal and not to worry about it.  He could do a blood work-up, but since I don't have insurance it would be really expensive and 99% of the time it comes back normal anyway.  

So...the long and short of it is that it could happen again really soon, in years to come, or never again.

"event","I had forgotten that yesterday would have been Becky's 24th birthday.  Maybe I didn't forget but instead pretended that I did so that the pain wouldn't be there.  I was kind of ""off"" yesterday, and now I realize why.  

It is still so very intangible to me...her death, the fact that I won't see her again, and my question of ""Where is she?""  I'm not really sure where she is right now.  I'm a big believer in heaven and hell, and it frightens me to think that she would be in hell.  I want to go against what I've been taught; that people who commit suicide are condemned to hell.  I want to believe that she is in heaven having one hell of a good time and that God has put her to work cleaning up the joint.  It makes me feel better to think that she is in heaven and not hell.  I don't want anyone I care so much about to be in hell.  However, my version of ""hell"" isn't really that bad of a place.  I think she may actually be more in purgatory and that she is very contemplative about her life.  I am somewhat happier thinking these thoughts instead of the alternative.

I think I will go visit her grave tomorrow when I am out and about.  I periodically go up there to visit her and my grandfather since they are neighbors in the cemetery.  

I'm especially thinking of my girls during this time and we have gotten through almost five months so far and it will get easier, for that I am sure."

"event","The Vagina Monologues fucking rocked!!!  And the best part was that I saw it with three women who are either pushing sixty or are sixty and we had a fantastic time.  It was so awesome!  They had a sold out crowd, which was so great for them.  It was odd on the way home when we were talking about the show, because we got into a conversations about the ""c"" word (which I never use) and is the subject of a monologue in the show called, ""Reclaiming Cunt.""  It was very weird to talk about that with my library co-workers!

Anywho, twas very cool to see it and the acting was so great."

"event","In some way I feel better that Justin wasn't murdered.  It is just too weird to me.  I don't want someone I went to school with or know really well to be murdered.  However, I don't like that it was related to drugs (he got a hold of bad drugs just to update Sara and Drea.)

I never had a problem with Jobgen, he was actually an alright guy towards me.  I guess in some ways I feel the same as I did with Becky's death because it is really hardt to mourn your contemporary.  His death doesn't hit as close to home, but it makes me nostalgic in many ways.  I'm sorry that he's gone, but I wish that drugs didn't ruin people's lives.

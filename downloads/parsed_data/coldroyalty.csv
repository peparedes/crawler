Maybe I'll go on a road trip to somewhere else. The plan was to go to France with the folks, but I don't know if that will happen. You never know.

"event","Hey whoever actually reads this. 
     Long time no entry. Life has been pretty okay. Started school on monday (hiatus on tuesday and wednesday). I'm not taking any classes I like...and to top it off I have to go to north miami 5x a week to go to some of these classes. I just need to reach my goal of 60 credits by the end of the fall. Classes- Stellar astronomy, lab, modern euro history, spanish, pre calculus. Poop! I better get in to UF. I'm saving money now. Mom's not paying shit (she said it herself). I think it would be cool to not tell anyone about my plan of leaving, and just call everyone up a week before I leave (or even when I get to my destination) and be like ""surprise! bye!"" I don't know why I'd find that to be cool. I just do. Not even for other people. Just for me. I need to take an art class or something, at least paint in my spare time. I miss it. I was so looking forward to taking drawing..guess that's not happening. Poo for FIU. My boyfriend fell into the abyss of Gainesville, so I won't see him for another few months. Who does he think he is moving to get a better edumacation? Anyone wanna go fetch him for me? Yeah.. ready, set GO! 
     So I'm just sitting here at work doing nothing as always. Feel like clawing my eyes out. That's how unbusy it is here. Pilots, come hither! Ah! I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I hope I don't fail pre-cal. I better not. My GPA hates me enough as it is. 3.675. It used to be a 4.0, then down to 3.783, and now this. Yarr! I want a GPA that people can compete with. This is pansy shit right here. Kill me. I'm bantering. 

PS. If anyone's ever read The Perks of Being a Wallflower and wondered what song he was talking about..the beautiful one..go to my myspace. It's wonderful. Makes me sleepy.

Oh yeah! Yesterday a Shaman came to my rel3308 class and did a ritual.It was alright. First we all split up into groups (earth, wind, fire, water) and each found our sounds and dances...our own rituals. Then we performed them together, got herbal liquid spit onto us (apparently healing us), and held hands and walkled around util we formed a really tight spiral..etc. There was more. It was so funny. At the end we had to yell out hardest. I did the girliest scream.. Chris sounded like a crazy drunk guy. Some girl sounded like a madman. It was hilarious. So, that was it.

"event","Fuck cock shit ass mother fucker! Merde! My human bio test is on tuesday and my face should be in a book today. Wasted time until about 5. Big mistake. By the time I went to study my parents got home. Too loud. My  mom was watching TV and my dad was playing cello (if Jordan reads this he'd cream himself). I'm addicted to this song. It's awesome on my terms. It's hard to find good Russian music. Fa sho, nigga. I can't believe Karo is dead. It's wierd. I just saw her maybe a month ago and she seemed relatively fine. And POOF! Flat liner. That sucks. RIP kiddo. Lesson to everyone: Don't do drugs. Seriously. Sounds like a mom lecture, but it's quite helpful. It's highly unlikely that you ACTUALLY KNOW what you're taking. The high of rat poison. Tempting, huh? Are we all really THAT curious to know how it feels to lose a few brain cells? I like mine the way they are, thank you. So, my memory sucks, but it could be worse. This is probably the longest entry I have written in a while. Might as well amuse myself with some banter. Poop. I just can't get myself to pick up my human bio book. I'm practically done with all of my French shit. Damn it! French test tomorrow, human bio test tuesday, write a paper on wednesday. What the fuck is next? This is MIGHTY GAY!

Peeling letter stickers off with a...I don't remember what the tool is called. I'm a tad irritated today..oh well. It's all overriden by my happiness about my grades this semester. STRAIGHT A'S!! I was jumping for joy when I found out. Worthy of the cabbage patch or any other white people dance. I'd do a cartwheel if i could remember how. Man, this livejournal is such a chore sometimes. Other times it's a temporary cure for boredom. No clue why, but the word ""ambiguous"" still appeals to me.

"event","Funny stuff...mind you, when I say funny I rarely mean funny. I was talking to my mom today and she was telling me random stories from when I was a munchkin. She said that when I was about 2 1/2 we were walking back home from the market and I was holding a green onion (I usually held stuff for her: loaf of bread, etc.). Usually when I did this people would tell me how cute I was helping my mommy hold the groceries. It was common so I got used to it. One time there was this old woman who could barely walk walking by me while I was holding the green onion and she didn't say anything. I jumped in front of her and stopped. Unfortunately she didn't notice me and toppled over me. My mom was so embarassed. After my mom helped her up, she said what I expected her to. Awe how cute I was. 
    Story #2: One day when I was maybe a year or more old and could barely walk- I used to lean on walls and after a few steps ((plop))- my  mom left some pins and needles on the sewing machine thinking that I couldn't get that far. She was in the kitchen and I waddled over do her with a bunch of pins and needles in my tiny hand. My mom freaked out and just took them from me and happily said thank you so I wouldn't do it again (reverse psychology).
    P.S. I just found out that I could work a record player at age 3. I had stories on records that I would play while going to sleep. Once if finished I would get up and turn it over. 
    Oh yeah! And when I got mad at my mom and cry I would blow my nose on her dress."

I thought the problem was taken care of. I was in the middle of a turn and it just stopped. I had to restart it. Thankfully, it worked. I went to Anika's house and ""chilled"" with her and Cristy. It was cool. 5 minutes in the pool, changed, ate some leftover chinese and it was off the palace. We watched Red Eye. Great movie. A certain someone (not pointing fingers at Anika) payed for her ticket in pocket change. That poor guy at the window. He deserved a hug.  Dropped them off as the car continued being gay. BLAH!

  Anybody want to buy me a '67 mustang? It's cheap. I swear I will give you my virginity if you buy this for me. You know you wanna. In any case. The van has been a  major load of ass lately. Tranny trouble. I want to shoot it. My dad says that it's just a leak where the fluid is. I really hope so..because it's being ultra gay for me. Sometimes it doesn't accelerate and makes rumbling noises. Only my stomach or the pope should make those. I went to the Hialeah Speedway on Saturday. It was cool..but man..I spent 10 hours there. It took forever to start. Since it had rained everything was late. They practiced for like 2 hours. Finally, they started racing..which also took forever. The cyclones were okay. Figure 8 bus racing was hilarious. The best part was the demolition. I smelled like car when I got home. Sexy, huh? We left like at 4am. Got a little  bitched at but it was worth it. Oh man, I've never seen so many Dale Earnhardt t-shirts in my life. There was some drunk guy repetitively screaming ""Get of the track, spooks"". It was so funny. He was extremely wasted. Mucho Budwieser. The line for food was huge there. It took forever. They were sold out towards the ending of the races. Man, you wouldn't believe how many people were there.  (((( I think I'm wired off of a large pixy stick by the way))) Over 6,000 I believe. All of the bleachers were packed. Insanity. Git 'er Done. Overused, I believe.

So, yeah. Went to Dave and Busters today. Interesting. Chris' cousin goes back to Albuquerque today. Sucks. Damn her! She's so cute. Chris and I racked up a total of 300 coupons. We ended up just buying candy. I ATE A CANDY TACO. It was wierd. So fruity and ((spicy)). Spicy fruitiness? What is the world coming to?

I need some shuteye. Rambling isn't my sexiest action. Or is it?"

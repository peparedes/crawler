Earlier today i talked to Natalie and she said she said she hasnt seen Justine in forever. I called Justine and asked her why she lied to me but she wasnt there so i left a message and i called her house minuits ago and she picked up then hung up on me. I called again and on the third ring her dad told me she wasnt taking calls. Shit hurts.

and we'll be playful roller-coaster friends
and tomorrow we'll say goodbye

Bradley Jacob Nowell feb. 22 1968 may 25 1996
""Drunk by noon but that's ok I'll be president some day."" 
-Those of you who were fortunate enough to meet Bradley Nowell saw a man who liked to smile and sing He did these two things with the greatest of ease The man we knew liked to pick up a guitar not needles but on the 25  May in 1996 all of us were shocked by the news of his tragic death  seven days earlier he married Troy Dendekker Things were lookin absolutely bright for him It was rumored that he even woke up extra early on the morning of his death to walk his dog on the beach because he felt just great to be living Hours later after he woke up he was found dead from a heroin overdose in his  san fransisco
 motel room He was supreme in the way he viewed life and he lived it to it's fullest That's also why he is dead because he chose not to waste his time

April 26th, 1992
There was a riot on the streets
Tell me where were you?
You were sittin' home watchin' your TV
While I was participating in some anarchy
First spot we hit it was the liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can't afford
With red lights flashin', time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire
Next stop we hit, it was the music shop,
It only took one brick to make the window drop
Finally we got our own P.A.
Where do you think I got this guitar that you're hearing today?
(Cuz' as long as I'm alive, I'ma live ill B)
When we returned to the pad to unload everything
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings
So once again we filled the van until it was full
Since that day my livin' room's been much more comfortable
Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It's getting harder, and harder, and harder each and every year
Some kids went in a store with their mother
I saw her when she came out she was gettin' some Pampers
They said it was for the black man
They said it was for the mexican
But not for the white man
But if you look at the streets, it wasn't about Rodney King
It's this fucked-up situation and these fucked-up police
It's about comin' up and stayin' on top
And screamin' 1-8-7 on a mother fuckin' cop
It's ain't in the paper, it's on the wall
National guard
Smoke from all around

(Any unit, any unit...)
(Homicide, never doing no time)

Give me my share, my share.
Gimme my share, I want it.
Gimme my share, I need it now, I need it now.
My share.
A wicked one who doesn't wanna see me go.
Just gimme my share, I want it. Gimme my share.
But you don't want to give it to me,
you don't wanna see me go.
Gimme my share, I want it, Gimme my share.
But there is a wicked one.

(Units be advised of an attempt 211 to arrest now at 938 Temple, 9-3-8
Temple, many subjects with bats trying to get inside the CB's
house...they're trying to kill him)

Let it burn
Wanna let it burn, wanna let it burn
Wanna wanna let it burn
(I feel insane)
Riots on the streets if Miami
Whoa, riots on the streets of Chicago
On the streets of Long Beach
In San Francisco
Riots on the streets of Kansas City
Tuskaloosa, Alabama
Cleveland, Ohio
Fountain Valley, Paramount, Vista Buelle
Eugene, Oregon

"event","I really didnt think that I would add another entree' over summer but this is somewhat of a special occasion. I met this great girl named Justine. Every time I am around her I feel like nothing could be better. I have seen her the last 3 days in a row and I still want to see her tomarrow. Its so wierd she makes me feel like I look better than I do without saying anything I have never met anyone who has done that and I must say that I like it. As for her she has no idea how amazing she really is. I really dont understand how someone so beautiful dosnt see it? but I guess that is how the world works. I have envited her to the bahammas but I dont know if her parents will aprove. I really want her to be able to go because the thought of not seeing her for two weeks is almost enough of a reason not to go. It is increadible I can just talk to her on the phone for hours and not get bored. Sometimes I just look into her eyes and wonder how she is intrested in me and how she dosnt see how beautiful she is?? In other news I just rediscovered a really great song while listing to Dave Matthews the song just makes you thing......how someone puts this kind of emotion into song is increadible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I'm leaving...
This Warehouse frightens me.
Has me tied up in knots,
Can't Rest For A Moment.

Soon I'm Going...
I'm slipping slow away
Hoping to find something better than
I've got inside here
And the Warehouse slips away...

Hey reckless mind
Don't throw away your playful beggining
You and I will fumble around in the touches
And be sure to...

Leave all the lights on
So we can see the black cat changing colors
And we can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide turns you around and around

Hey we have found
Becoming one in a million
Slip into the crowd
This question I found in the gap in the sidewalk

Keep all your sights on
Hey the black cat changing colors
We can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide choose to turn you

And here I sit
Life goes on, end of tunnel, TV set
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistical bit
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away

This I admit
Taste so good, hard to believe an end to it
Smell touch feel
How could this rhythm ever quit
Bags packed on a plane
Hopefully to heaven yeah

Shut up I'm thinking
I had a clue now it's gone forever
Sitting over these bones
You can read in whatever you're needing to

Keep all your sights on
The big bad black cat that's
Changing colors
It's not the colors that matter
But that they'll all fade away

Life goes on, end of tunnel, TV set
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistical bit
And soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away


This I admit
Seems so good
Hard to believe an end to it
Warehouse is bare
Nothing at all inside of it
Walls and halls have disappeared, they've disappeared

My love I love to stay here
My love I love to stay here
My love I love to stay here
My love I love to stay here
In a corner was wondering...
If a change could be better than this
And then I worry
Maybe things won't be better than they have been here
Here in the warehouse

At the Warehouse
At the Warehouse
How I love to stay here
At the Warehouse
Every man and woman get alive

That's our blood down there
Seems poured from the hands of angels
But trickle into the ground
Leaves the Warehouse bare and empty

My heart's numbered beat
Still echo in this empty room
Fear wells in me
But nothing seems enough to defend
So I am going away, I am going away.
~Dave Matthews- Warehouse

The song really sums up my last year at Christ School. Wondering how things with my friends will be when I come home for summer. I guess that will all unwravel in good time but I now have someone to call just to call and someone to talk to when I just want to talk ....... so I hope that everything works out for the best but right now in the words of Sean..... It all good man ... Its all good.

Now I am not allowd to lock my door at night because the knocking on my door in the morning disgruntles Mr. Coddington. Also what the fuck is with this wake up shit in the first place......is the point of this school not to teach independance. Ok I am independant but I am told when to wake up and when to go to bed.....and I have a designated study profile. And the thing i most hate is when iggnorant people talk about the old days with Mr. Harris, god the past is the past. Just an example of one of the moronic rules that are applied in this dorm would be the rule stating that I can have only 4 ""wall hangings"" or I can only have a green comforter. And now that I cant lock my door even more of my shit will be stolen........God damn tapping sucks fucking dick all these new proctures power trippin ..... except mike.

"event","Well the weekend was good. On friday I went to the mall and got two trippy ass tapestries that are 3-D in blacklight. That night I came back to school and had a pint of ice cream and two cokes so there was no chance of me goin to bed at 11:00 so i chilled in my room and shopped for some cd's and GD shit. At like 12:00 my eyes were burning from staring at the computer so i went out to the commens room and watched ""shorties watching shorties"" Conan O' Brien and PIMP MY RIDE but near the end of pimp my ride i passed out and woke up the next morning at like 6 and went back to my room and slept untill like 8 and couldnt fall back alseep so i just watched TV. On Saturday I went to Downtown Ashville and chilled. Mc. Murry drove the trip and all I have to say bout that is it was a ""trip"" he has his ho's on speed dial and his bitches roamin. My favorite was when he pulled up to this college chick and was like u my ho aint u.....ur speed dial #7. And for today it was pretty chill.......mostly ping pong and wallmart.....(drivin by McNizzle)
I failed room inspection for the first time in 11 weeks so I did get a little mad but what ever I just didnt do my job.

God I cant wait for summer to the minuit from when I wrote this I have 12 days and 24 min left till summer. for some insperation I leave u with this live DMB & Tim song which I have been diggin.



La La....La La De Da La La
La Da De De Da La....La La Ye Ya
La Da Da Dum

We were above
You were standing underneath us
We were not yet lovers
Dragons were smoked
Bumblebees were stinging us
I was soon to be crazy

Eat, drink, and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Eat, drink, and be merry
For tomorrow we die
'Cause we're Tripping Billies

We're wearing nothing
Nothing but our shadows
Shadows falling down on the beach sand
Remembering once,
Out on the beaches we wore
Pineapple grass bracelets

So why would you care
To get out of this place
You and me and all our friends
Such a happy human race

'Cause we're Tripping Billies

We are all sitting
Legs crossed round a fire
My yellow flame she dances
Tequila drinking, oh, our
Minds will wander
To wondrous places

So why would you care
To get out of this place
You and me and all our friends
Such a happy human race

Eat, drink, and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Eat, drink, and be merry
For tomorrow we die

Check 'em out, Boyd, yeah!

Eat, drink, and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Eat, drink, and be merry
For tomorrow we die

Wow that song is really good live. But whatever and I guess I can leave u with one last quote.

What a long strange trip, it has been

Austin and I watched the movie Big Fish, then we went driveing around the neighborhood and I met a girl who I actually went to school with in 2nd - 4th grade, I actually reconized her and she reckonized me. The next day she came over, but could only stay a little while cause Austin, my mom, her friend, adn me went to the best restraunt, Fogo de Choe. This place was amazing, it is a Brazillian theme and you have people with giant cuts of meat come and serve you as much as you can eat. After dinner we dropped off Ausitn and drove home. On sunday we had a mothers day BBQ and I got to see my cousin. When my cousin jumped im my pool he forgot to take his phone out of his pocket.........he had to get a new one.

"event","Well Saturday was Zelda Fest and It was actually really fun. The day started at around 11 30 when I awoke to take a shower. After my Shower I went to Breakfast and could only get one bagel befor Mr. Wadawits made us leave. after that I went back to my dorm and watched some TV and played some Ping Pong. At around 1 00 I went down to the LaX game and stayed for awile but got boerd because there was a break for penalties every 3 minuits. I did see George with his Robotic arm on the sidelines. I call it a robotic arm because he had to have a one inch thick pad over his cast so one arm was like 3 inches bigger than the other. I tried to make him draw buttons and switches on it but he refused. When I got back to my dorm I watched TV untill Zelda Fest started and watched John and Hunter play ""ULTIMATE PING PONG"" in witch you only get a point when the ball rolls on teh opponints side........so yo can imagin the mayham. Zelda Fest started and Josh and Mikes band stated off and I stayed for their songs but after them some Emo band played so I went back to see how the game was goin but it was two other teams playing so I walked all teh way back to see Sean, Richard, and Wigndam play. I think they were pretty good considering Wigndam decided to join like 30 minuits befero they staged.

After all the bands played I went to the dance witch was..........interesting. Through the duration of the dance no more than 5 people were on the floor at once. and when most of the ladies had left Michael turned to Alvin.......need I say more.......Ok I will they grinded untill Michaels ADD got the best of him and he danced with Cubbler,......I think this made Cubbler uncomfertable........so alvin danced with Ms. Morrison and Michael joined the fun.



well I guess I will leave you with a little wisdom..........Befor the Allman Brothers were The Allman Brothers Band they were called The Allman Joys......that was there fist name."

We arrived and met our buddies. Since we worked with them in pairs Doug and I shared our buddy Richard. Both of us already knew him because he came to visit our school and Doug hosted him. We all headed off to the march where all the teams were introduced. There we sat for awhile not knowing what to do, due to the fact neither Doug or I had ever been to the SO. We finnaly got to his first event, the soft ball throw, and Richard came in second. Then we brought could not figure out how to get his lunch, but after about an hour of trying we found his teacherand dropped him off. After we dropped him off we just chilled and ate lunch. Then we split up and I went with Nate to drop off his buddy for lunch, his system was different because his buddy was only like 5 so he had to go inside. Nate and I just walked around and met up with Jordan and Mitch. But shortly after that I had to go pick up Richard. He had his 50 meter dash, which he won. Then Doug went and dropped him off and I just walked around then Nate and I went to get his buddy. After that it was almost time to go so I went up to the bus only to have forgotten my jacket. I ran back across the campus, luckly Mark gave me a ride and I got lost in the school building. Finnally i got the jacket and ran back to the bus to head back here. Once we returted I came back to my room to get ping pong stuff and commensed a match with John."

After that I came back and took a shower. I ran and grabbed a bite to eat and headed off to the movies on the Christ School bus. The drive was interesting due to the fact that Mr. Brown was driving the trip. In the first thirty seconds he almost hit a big van and and swirved and came very close to hitting a mail box. But we made it to the movies and me and my friend Matt Warren met up with Kelsey and Savnna. I got tickets to hellboy and we figured that we would just walk into Girl Next Door. All went according to plan untill we got kicked out along with about eight other people. So we went to Hell Boy and it was horriable. But we left and walked to wall mart and I got ping pong stuff. Kelsey got picked up and me and Matt just chilled for like 20 minuits untill we headed back to school....... with Mr. Brown.
    On saturday it was a good day. I woke up at exactly 9:59 and walked to my commens room for Mr. Greys enrichment. We watched a documentary on the Buena Vista Socil Club which is a big band consistin of some guys over the age of 80. It lasted untill around 10:50 so i went to eat breakfast. I came back to my room and got oing pong stuff for the day. Ping Pong matches went on for most of the day we set up couches for the next players and brought out some music to lisin to in the heat of battle. at around 4:30 Lockett, Noland, Jake, and I went to Downtown Ashville. We had fun we went to Bean Street to eat and went to Mellow Mushroom. McNizzle drove the trip and he had some quotes that I will never forget. He also told us that if baseball wins conference that he will get gold teeth and a pimp suit and wear it for a week. While he enated the innerpimp in hiself he told us that he ""has his ho's on speed dile, and infact there goes one now."" He deffentally made the trip. After that it was back to ping pong for the remander of the day. Untill Tiny had a BBQ with around 28 burgers. I had 4 they were delicious and we herd the musical stylings of Richard........ha. But it was fun.
    Sunday was by far the best day of the weekend. It started of at 12:00 for me when I awoke to a hungery stomache. I went to the dinning hall and ate like 3 bagles and 2 bowls of ceral. By the time I got back the war had started. jake was filling up water balloons to get doug with. and it started with John hitting Nathan with a water balloon from the bottem of the steps while nathan was outside the front door. Then Mr. Coddington came close to getting him. and form there it was war. almost the entire dorm got in on the action. We started filling nalgine bottles and dumping them on eachother at one point. i was the first to get Wheelas..... and I got him good. the war lasted for around 2 hrs. and Mr. C got a picture of John dumping a trsh can full of water on Doug as he walked through the front door. Now that will be a good thing to rember about Cunniham 04'. After that it was white glove and my 4 week non-fail record is still going. Then it was the usual Chapel and Dinner. Then the usual study hall. But what a weekend to have every day had somthing good in it."

So Instead of having to go to class at 1:40 my acadimic day was over at 11:50. In Spanish I don't know what happended due to the fact that I was asleep. Then in English I got back my test and it was lower than expected.......88. After English I ate lunch. Harrison came up with a thougth that he has never herd me state a complete thought. This I got mad at and asked why he constently gives me shit about everything. His reply was that it is because I am my very own breed of human....being that I have good grades....yet am an oger.......that I am athletic but goffy as hell. I said that Darden gives me shit and he dosn't like me. Harrison stated that darden likes me or he would just say nothing to me. Then I asked harrison if he liked me and he said that if he hated me he would treat me like Austin and say nor more than ""get out of my way"" to me. He critized me for chopping up strawberries to put in icecream. Then he asked me to make him one........need I say more.
Today was a chill day in Baseball also. I hit pretty good and play good in the field. but I got into another arguement with Cubbler abotu goin and gettin a ball that the other 4 people doin nothing could get....but i had to get off third base and run and get a  ball. The day ended well with a movie with my girl friend....though the movie was horriable, Hell Boy...i do not recommend. Corny as hell. But after she left Matt and I went to wallmart to get ping pong stuff....PING PONG HAS BECOME A WAY OF LIFE."

At first I was told I will play later in the game, but as the innings went on all I herd was ""next inning at third,"" after the second time of haring this I got mad and threw the baseball at a pole and walked out of the dugout........finally, after Cubbler made Alvin so mad that he quit the team, I was put in at left field. Then I was up to bat....I got on base, stole second with a lucky slide, and Jamie had the RBI to have us win by the slaughter rule. Game 10 to 0. after the game McMurray talked to me and said not to let it get under my skin and that I did  good in my base running. I guess while now in study hall listin to the relaxing Future Man and his Synthax Drumitar calms me down.....but the real anger will show in the ping-pong match after study hall consisting of me and my nemisis Jake."

Then i preceded to Mr. Sarrels class where we discussed evolution. mindway through i had to leave to go to my baseball game. apparently even though my batting average is better than half the teams and I start Cubbler decided not to play me until the last inning when he pissed of Alvin so much Alvin just left the game and quit the team.

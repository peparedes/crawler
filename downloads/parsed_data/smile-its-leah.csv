"event","today was like one of the first days i wore my hair up to school.
<bold> first period- hmm mrs. slaughter. i cant stand looking at her, her eyes pop out of her head and she has ginormous dimples, i hate it. 

<small> 2nd period- MR TOTH. gosh i love that teacher. he's soo cool. we had a test and it was pretty hard and i dont think i did very good on it butttt i love mr. toth.

<big> 3rd period- coach keyes.. geometry.. whoa, i hate this class. its soo hard. she's working my butt off. im barely passing her. eeek.

<small> 4rth.. Mrs. Walker- art. i dont like her at all! her eyes pop out of her head too. wtf is up with teacher and eye popping. geez laweez. but i can't draw therefore. i dont like the class. makes sense

<big> 5th- COACH STEINBRUCK. however u spell that. hes totally rad. he cussed like so much in that class and he makes fun of Bo. hehe its funny. 

<small> 6th.. Athletics.. hmm well i sprained my ankle last week during basketball and it doesnt hurt at all but its still swollen so i can't do volleyball.. hmm great. i should be able to play soon. i really hope. 

<big> 7th. Mr. Howard. BIOLOGY. we do nothing in his class. today he sat at his computer the whole time and we did nothing. he didnt even give us a worksheet or nothing.. the only thing he did was take attendance.. thats about all we do in his class. boorring. 

me and blake are good. :)"

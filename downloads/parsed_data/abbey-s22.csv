so, anyways, today, me, briana and michelle got Brown Jacket Guy's cell # (woot woot) *happiness and dancing retardates*
one of my dad's friends recognized me in the car with a bunch of people when i went over to briana's house during spring break... and so a far fetched lie was told and we were with brittni's cousin who had her friend drive... and it worked, so, so far i'm in the clear.  it sucks that this valley is so freaking small *frowns*  and filled with magical grass smokers *smirks*
today lauren and carrissa got thrown out of the Taber Posse by none other then Mr.SG himself... of coarse, they don't know that yet.  but Mr.SG came over to me and briana and carrissa was like ""J****(his name), can you get the paper over there, i missed the trash can!"" 
and Mr.SG started complaining.  ""Why can't they just leave me alone?"" he turned to me and briana.  ""Promise me something.""  He goes ahead.  ""never, ever, smoke pot, it'll turn you into one of them.  Fucking annoying blonde....""  i forget the rest
anyways, that and BSG giving us his # just made my day better, except star testing just kinda killed it all... anyways, me and briana were pretty happy the rest of the day

   ellie's cousins morgan and blaire were there for about a wk, but then they had to leave.  morgan would have been so excited to go to the waterfall, but they left early that day (ha ha).  it was so much fun, already mom is planning to go next year, that would be so cool.  we went to this lau thing and it was so BORING, except for the fire part, which was pretty cool, especially since morgan almost got his head caught on fire i would have laughed myself to death.  me and ellie made up to many funny jokes, here are some, if you really care to know.  i'm just writing them down so i dont forget.
1. mouth condem for vampires
2. sexy dentures (thank you for not hearing what we were talking about yet agian morgan)

"event","Ok, so now I'm doing better today. actually I just got back from riding lessons.  I'm so happy that it's Saturday and I dont have to go to my grandma's today, by the end of the week I was stuck watching cartoons LOL.
Ok so nothin's new except that I'm doing better. Jullianne said that in dance I have to dance with this one guy.  No thanx, I'll pass. And who knows, maybe she's just trying to ruin my life.  My mom and dad got a HUGE bed and now they finally put it together.  They're gonna need a stool to get up onto it LOL!!!  I can't help but laugh when I picture them jumping up on their bed.LOL
I can't wait till Spring Break!  I have S.B. 1 week before all of my friends down in Santa Barbara and so I plan to stop by La Colina during one of their lunch times and say HI EVERYBODY!  ok um, so yeah, fun.  My mom and dad rearranged their room so now when I'm on the computer I can lean against their bed, like old times. 
In dance we just started learning the dance for the performance (yay!).  It's my most favorite time of the ""dance year"".  I Jazz we got to see our costumes.  It seems like their just going to move out of their normal place and wala flash everybody!  I can't wait till we see our ballet and pointe costumes, I hope that they're pretty *dreams*.  But usually my class gets the cruddy costumes *glares* ok so wutevah"

"event","Ok, so I'm at my dad's work today because I'm sick and I've been sick for the whole week so um, yeah.  I don't think I'm going to go to school tomorrow eather(is that how you spell it???).  School is ok, i mean, how fun can it be.  Laurel's birthday was on Saturday and me, laurel, melissa, and brittani, went to majik mountain.  my friend brittany couldn't come because she had to take this stupid test for Dunn, her mom wants her to have options for next year.  ok then after we got back we picked up Brittany from her house and when to Laurel's house for a sleep over.  and we saw the grudge, the most scariest movie I've ever seen.  and then in the morning i fet really really sick and had to go home early.  and i haven't done anything interesting from then on.  there are some other details of the party that i'm not going to talk about.LOL,yeah.  this morning I was watching cartoons like Lazy Town and Dora the Explorer.  ha, I fell asleep during that.  uggg, i'm getting a headache now, the headaches just won't go away.  so um, yeah whatevah.  
   I had The Habit for lunch (onion rings).  so that's how my life has been, very exciting, isn't it? Ha, no, ok. I don't really know what else to write, so um, yeah ok whatevah.  Time to go and do nothing."

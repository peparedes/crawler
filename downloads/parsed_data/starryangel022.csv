"event","Yesterday morning was a nightmare come true.  I know Mike has a temper...and it's been bad before, but this.......

I woke up to hearing him tell my dog that if he ate one more of his socks he'd put a bullet in his head.  So, I come flying into the room and tell him that he'd better never talk to my dog like that again.  It becomes a blur...but somehow, we get aruging...then screaming.  And I mean, SCREAMING.  Before I know it, he kicks over the coffee table and is throwing a glass at me.  I duck to avoid the shattering.  He then picks up a pillow off the couch and rips it open, throwing the stuffing all over then flings the pillow and hits me in the face so hard I stumble back.  As I'm trying to regain balance, he's coming towards me fast.  I grab ahold of the blanket I have hanging in the doorway of the living room (to keep cool air in there from my air conditioner), and he rips it out of my hand so hard the entire blanket is ripped down from the pins I had holding it up.  He has a fist made and I have just enough time to turn my head out of it's path and he ends up smacking the wall behind me.  Hard.  His hand is bleeding...he is shaking his bloody hand in my face...he's telling me it's <i>my</i> fault his hand is bleeding.  <i>I</i> did it to him.  I tell him to not touch me, I grab the phone so it's in my hands and hold it.  Everything in me says ""call 9-1-1"".  But I'm scared. I know he's mad.  If I call the police, what will he do to me?!  So, although I'm shaking violently I tell him to get away from me.  Just get away.  Leave me alone.  Please.  Don't touch me.  Don't talk to me.  Just please go away.  I stumble into the bathroom and shut the door behind me (which, unfortunatly, has no lock).  I suddenly hear him again...he's screaming.  As we were fighting, my dog was chewing another one of his socks.  He yells for me to get my ""fucking ass"" out there and see what my ""fucking dog"" is doing.  I don't respond.  I'm dizzy.  I'm sick to my stomach.  He comes through the bathroom door, sock in hand.  He takes the sock, damp from my dogs chewing, and wipes it all over my face and trys to stick it in my mouth...

I decide I'm going to leave.  I'm running late for work.  I'm scattered.  I just need to go.  He follows me out of the house, telling me I need help.  I have mental problems.  It's my fault he acts like he does.  If I was a normal person, he wouldn't have to do those things to make me listen.  I know I don't need help, he does.  But I don't dare tell him.  I'm scared for my life.  I can't sleep.  I can't eat.  I'm just a shell of what used to be me.  This is my life.  The life I'm coming to accept."

"event","I went by my grandma and grandpa's old house tonight because I have an Aunt that's staying there until it is sold.  It was the first time I'd been there since my grandfather died in February.  First time I'd been there and neither of them were there (my grandma passed away January 8, 2004).  It was an odd feeling....and it was all I could do to hold back my tears.  

I walked in the house, and first instinct was to look in the kitchen at the table.  There was the chair my grandma was always sitting in, eatting her ice cubes out of the tray.  Next to it, my grandpa's chair where he's play his hand held poker game for hours smoking his cigarettes.  Both chairs were empty.  

I made my way into the living room.  There was the couch I sat on next to my grandma the last time I was with her alive at her home on Christmas Eve 2003.  Acrossed the living room, my grandpa's bed he slept in.  That was the last place I saw him alive....this past Valentine's day when I stopped to give him some small gifts.

The lawn chair my grandma sat in was still on the deck.  She'd sit there for hours just watching the neighborhood.  The red coat grandma loved so much....it's still hanging off the door knob in the kitchen.

Oh my God....it's just hitting me tonight how much I actually do miss them.  And the feeling is almost more then I can handle.  I'd give anything to open that front door and see them at that kitchen table again....."

"event","It's been awhile since I've done a real entry.  Lots going on in my life and in my mind.

Mike and I have been doing a lot of fighting.  To the point where I've just reached my limit.  We got into a really stupid argument a few days ago and some how a stupid argument, that should of been avoided in the first place, escalated into an all out screaming match.  Then, we were fine for a couple of days until this morning-when out of nowhere he feels the need to bring up the other night again and starts in on me again.  And, in all of what he said this morning...he made a comment that suddenly opened my eyes and made me realize that maybe this isn't the life for me.  I won't get into what the comment was, but it was directed towards me and it was cruel and intended to hurt.  I realize the comment was made out of anger and I'm sure he really doesn't mean it or feel that way.  The thing is though, it was said and even if it wasn't ment-it's impact may be what is making me think about breaking off this relationship.

I've done nothing but think all day today.  I thought about my life and where it stands now.  What kind of future I'm going to have if I keep in on this path.  And all the other possibilities this world has out there.  

I went and spent time with my mom this morning after this incident and talking with her helped me out alot.  I know it's an old and annoying saying but....there's lots of fish in the sea.  And I know there is someone out there who can love the real me for who I am.  And I am really truely beginning to think Mike is not that someone.

Mike's highstrung, dependant, cocky, immature.  I'm laid back, a free spirit, independent, grown-up.  I'm tired of always having to explain myself to him all the time.  I'm the type of person who can't stand to be sufforcated, I don't want to be clung too.  If I feel like getting in my car and spending the day alone just driving around....I want to do that with no consequences...without having to explain myself.  I love spending time with people I care about....but I value alone time as well and I never get any of that with him.  I don't want a life that's completely predictable   I want a life that's full of surprises.  I need someone that is in it for the good and the bad....someone who can understand I'm a happy person by nature-but even I have my bad days...and that I'm fine with that.  I want to see the world...I want to break out of here and see what else this world has to offer.  I want to spend a summers eve at the ocean just burrying my feet in the sand and wathing the sun descend from the sky.  I want to go on a safari.  I want to take a stroll in a rainforest.  I want to see the Effiel tower as I walk down a beautiful French street.  I want to go to Mardis Gras and get drunk outta my mind and let loose.  I need someone who wants to be there with me from now until the end....someone who can keep up with all my dreams and wants to see the world over with me.  Someone who doesn't care about how much it costs to see the world over....but cares about how much these dreams mean to me and wants to spend every second experiencing them with me.  I want the kind of life that I can look back on when I'm on my death bed and tell those I love; ""I've had fun"".

Where is my `someone'?!"

"event","I read a bulliten board outside a local church and what it said really hit home with me.  It read:  Spring; Nature's way of reminding us that life does go on.

Alot has happened to me since I last wrote, more then I ever could of imagined.  

First off, I lost the baby.  I had a miscarriage five months into it for reasons unknown.  The doctor said it was nothing I did wrong, that sometimes these things just happen.  Still, I've blamed myself.  If only I'd done <i>this</i>different, or did <i>that</i> instead....

Next, my grandfather passed away on February 17th.  We knew he was sick and that he didn't have long, but his passing still was very unexpected.  He was full of cancer and tumors.  He ended up bleeding to death in my aunt's arms as they waited for the ambulance at 2:30 in the morning (I believe a tumor or something in his lungs exploded).  It kills me to think of all the time I should have spent with him and didn't.  I always had something else to do.  I found excuses not to go there, because going there and seeing him sick hurt me because I knew there was nothing in the world that I or anyone else could do for him.  Last time I saw him was Valentine's Day.  Mike and I stopped by and gave him a teddy bear and chocolate covered cherrie's (his favorite).  We didn't stay long because we were on our way out to dinner.  Now, I wish I skipped dinner and stayed.  I wish I could of known that would be the last time I ever saw him.  My Aunt Diane gave me back the teddy bear I gave him after he passed and I took it home and buried it in a closet-I can't stand even seeing it because when I see it I remembed him holding it after I gave it to him.  The day my Grandpa died, a part of me died along with him.

Then came Easter Sunday, March 27th.  My Aunt Nancy passed away, also cancer related.  She had throat and lung cancer from smoking cigarettes.  She was only 55 years old.  After watching what she went through....having to be fed through a feeding tube, having to be hooked up to a machine in order to breath....I'll NEVER even think about smoking.  She suffered alot, she really did.  More then any person should ever have too.  I would go home from visting her in the hospital ever night and cry because I couldn't take seeing her that way.  My Aunt Nancy was always the party animal in the family...she loved tacos, Pizza Hut Supreme pizzas, Coors Light.  She was fun, witty, and a match for the most sarcastic of people.  I miss her alot and really wish I had taken time to get to know her better when she was alive.  I wish I hadn't waited until she was dying to spend time with her.

If anyone out there can learn from my mistakes, do it.  Spend time with those you care about.  You NEVER are to busy to spend time with family and loved ones, so stop making excuses.  Trust me, when it's too late...you will wish you did.  

But, as I started off my entry saying....life does go on.  No matter what happens, we have to deal with it and we have to live out our lives.  I know my Aunt Nancy and my Grandpa would be devastated if I sat around mourning them.  So, I've been trying even harder to live my life better.  I'm still doing the things I love, but I've found that lately I've become a more patient person then I ever was in the past.  I've found that when others start cutting another person down, I'm not all that willing to jump in.  I'm nice to everyone, even those that don't deserve it, because I want to be.  I don't want to be responsible for causing someone more hurt or pain when everyone out there has more then their share in one for or another.  I'm not sure why my Grandpa and Aunt's passing has brought all this to me...but it has, and I'm thankful.  I've opened my eyes up alot.  

Life for me is going on....and I'm glad."

"event","It's been months since my last update, and if you want me to be honest I really didn't ever plan on updating again.  But, lately I've had so much on my mind that I need to get it all out of my head and this is the only place I have to turn.

I've been homesick lately.  Alot.  Then again, maybe it's not homesick so much as it is that I wish I were younger again.  Wish I could be back in high school when I thought my life was SO complicated....but looking back now, I realize just how simple it really was and just how trivial my problems were.  I miss the days I'd get up and go to school, go to cheerleading practice, come home for dinner, and then sit in front of the computer chatting away with my many far away friends (who were my best friends at the time, but now I've lost touch with most all of them) while I half heartedly did my homework.  I think about those days alot lately.  And it's not that I don't love where my life is now.  Life away from home....it's an adventure.  Life with Mike....it's exciting.  My life in general, is great.  In many ways I'm happy and excited about all that is to come.  In other ways, I feel scared and alone.  Scared of change.  Wanting to revert back to old, familiar ways because they were secure and safe for me.  Alone because in reality, I have no one but Mike in my life.  I've grown apart from most all of my friends.  Sara.....she's still my friend, but we aren't as close as before.  She has a boyfriend now, I have Mike....she works two jobs, I spend most of my time at my one.  Our friendship is still that, but that's changed.  Charlie....my best friend ever since he moved here in eighth grade.  We started growing apart before I ever left home, but not it's more so then ever.  Sure, if we run into each other we say hi and talk for awhile.  If I'm at the mall, I'll stop in Hot Topic if I see him working.  But, I don't go out of my way to get a hold of him or make plans and nor does he do that for me.

Change.  It's inevitable for all of us.  We can't escape it because it's all around us.  We change.  Our friends change.  Our way of life changes.  We can fight it all we want too, but it comes and alot of the time we don't even realize it was here until it's done and over with.  Change is scary.  Change is exciting.  Change is a million different emotions and feelings, all wrapped up into one six letter little word.  I look forward to change.  But I also dread it at the same time.  A big part of me would love to go back to when life was simpler.  When all I had to worry about was that major math test on Friday and which shoes look better with these jeans.  Back to a time when the highlight of my day was sitting on the internet chatting on instant messenger.  

You know who I really miss when I have thoughts like this?!  Fleet.  May he forever rest in peace.  He always knew what to say.  That would be nice right now.  Having someone to talk too who would know just the right thing to say."

"event","Wow....been some time since I had the chance to actually get online and write.  Lots to write about now too....

Still with Mike and things are still going great. I just found out not to long ago that......we're going to have a baby.  I was shocked at first.  A little upset.  Scared at the idea of telling my parents (my mom is very religious and I was convinced my dad would disown me).  But after the shock wore off, I had this awesome feeling off.....finally.  I've always wanted kids, but I pictured it happening years down the road when I was more financially secure and prepared.  But...the best things in life don't always wait for us to be prepared for them.  I told Mike and at first he didn't know what to think or say, but now he is happy and brags to everyone that he's going to be a daddy.  As for me telling my parents, I told my mom first.  She took it better then I thought, she was disappointed about me having a baby out of wedlock but she took it alright.  She gave me a lecture about birth control....and for the record I WAS on birth control when I got pregnant!!!!  So, girls out there on birth control and reading this....be warned, just because your on it doesn't mean it will work.  I've been on the pill for years, and I still got pregnant.  A friend of mine was on the patch and she became pregnant.  It happens.  I'm proof.  But, anyways.  I was working on the nerve to tell my dad....he was the hardest because he gets upset/angry and it's not fun.  To my surprise, he took it a million times better then my mom.  He was like; ""I'm going to be a grandpa!!!"" and he was happy.  He gave me a hug, told me he loved me, and told me to make sure I took good care of myself and took my vitamins.  

Anyways, that's the biggest news.  Actually....it's about the only news.  I'm still working lots of hours and make my $$$.  Mike and I are looking at buying a house and we have one in mind.  And, all in all, I'm very happy right now.  Happy with where my life is headed, happy with where I'm at right now.

Hopefully, I'll be back soon to write some more.  

Until then...."

Things with Mike and I are going well.  He's planning on buying me an engagement ring very soon and I can't wait.  I adore him more then I have ever adored anyone.  I'm glad things are finally falling into place in my life.  I've waited so long for this.

I got my first tattoo.  I ended up getting a pink dolphin on the back of my right shoulder.  It's so freaking cute and everyone who sees it loves it.  It has small baby blue swirls (supposed to look like water) around it and the dolphin itself is a bright pink with baby blue eyes.  It didn't hurt bad to get done, just a little uncomfortable at points.  And a few days after it was done, it began to itch sooooo bad and I wasn't allowed to itch it. 

Aight, time to go raid the 'fridge before I head home."

"event","Wow, it's been over a month since the last time I wrote.  Didn't realize it had been so long.  Part of it's because I couldn't remember my login name for the life of me.  

Life's going.  For the most part, things are going great and heading in a positive direction.  Of course, there have been some hard times.  Lately, I'm going through a hard time where money is concerened.  Seems like I just can't get enough of it.  I pretty much pay my bills just barely on time and don't have any extra to spend on anything.  Living on your own isn't all it's cracked up to be.  But, I've been saving money and budgeting well and by next month I should have a descent amount saved up and be back to having extra spending money again.  Just have to stay level headed.

Mike and I are doing great.  We're talking about getting married, but not sure when we want this to happen (this summer, most likely).  We aren't engaged yet, but I think that's going to happen soon.  I'm really happy with him and I love him more then I ever though you could love someone.  He feels the same, according to a friend of mine who he talked with one night.  She told me he kept telling her how much he loved me and how happy he was.  There have been times in the past where I've loved and thought I couldn't live without the person....but things would happen and life would go on and I'd realize that I could live without them.  This time though, I really do belive I found the one person I can not live without.  I can't even think of life without him.  If I lost him, I don't think I'd ever look for someone else...because I'd always compare them to him and what he's done for me.

My horroscope today has kept me positive: A favor you did for someone a long time ago is about to be repaid, but you won't see it coming. You've probably forgotten all about it -- but they haven't. 

Aight, time for me to take off.  I have a messy apartment to clean *sigh*."

"event","I tried laying out in the sun for awhile, but it's just one of those days where it's too hot.  Trying to work on my tan since I'm going to North Carolina tonight.  Didn't mention the trip sooner because I didn't know until just a half hour ago I was going.  Mike and a few people he works with are going there tomorrow for their work and they had enough room for one more so he told me I could go with them.  I figured, why not?!  I have the next couple days off from work and it'll be nice to get outta here for a bit.

I ended up finding not only white, but also a pink neon light kit for my car.  Problem is....the white and pink kits both start at $169.99...while if I stick with red as I planned it's only $99.  If I were still living at home, it would be a no-brainer...I'd decide between doing white as I wanted, or re-doing my car pink.  But, I gotta do the responsible thing now so I'm going to think it out and then either start saving up for white or go with red (pink is going to have to be outta the question, unfortunatly....in order to do pink I'd have to re-do my seat covers, wheel cover, and re-paint over some of the other red I did...kinda sucks because pink would be so cute).  

We ended up getting absolutely killed at work last night.  It was one big disaster.  Poor Deziree was the only other server on (besides me) and every customer she had was just miserable and bitchy.  I love that girl to death, but she JUST came back after being gone for awhile and she isn't back in the swing of things fully yet; so she was struggling on top of trying to deal with people giving her a hard time.  I kept taking as many tables as I possibly could so she could keep up with the ones she had.  We both ended up making good money. 

Alright, I'm going to go out and help my dad out in the garden.  I love digging and doing things out there for some reason.  Who would of thought I would like gardening?!"

Things have been going well.  I still love living on my own, but miss home sometimes.  Had one of those moments yesterday where I found myself wishing I was at home.  It was so much easier to save money and so much less stress, in some ways.  But, I'm doing well on my own-better then lots of my friends are or have done.  Luckily, saving money has always been a strong point for me.

I'm going to be starting a second job soon, and I can't wait.  I'm going to be working through a center for disabled and elderly.  Basically, your encouranged to get them out and about since they are unable too on their own.  You get paid to take them to the mall, out to eat, and to just hang out with them.  I know a girl who took one of the people to Six Flags for the day...and got paid for it!!  How neat is that?!  And it's not just the money....I sincerely like the idea of being able to hang out with someone and take them places they can't go on their own.  

Well, time for me to go clean all the junk outta my car (since Mike promised he'd vaccuum it out for me after he gets outta work) and go lay in the sun for a bit.  Ta-ta."

You mean everything to me.

You were in my dream
Before i even knew there was a you and me,
Now i can't wait to see your smile,
When i wake up each day,
It makes it worth wild,
With the kinda love you plant inside, 
Specially with a heart so empty as mine.
All your soft tenderness is the one thing that i don't wanna miss.

[Chorus:]
I pray,
When it's time for me to say goodbye
I'll never forget looking in your eyes,
I pray,
That i feel your touch 
And that God doesn't forget our love,
I pray,
When i close my eyes,
I can still see visions of you on my mind.
I pray,
That i see you in another life,
I pray that you stay by my side.
Oh i pray.

Everything that you give to me,
Only comes in a fantasy,
It seems like life goes by so fast,
But in this time i wanna make it last. (i pray)
I hate that we live to die,
But only God knows why (i pray)
We all have a purpose, 
And to see you again it'll be worth it.

I wish that i could stop time,
I wish that i could rewind,
To the very begining of every second of my life.
To ask God on my hands and knees,
To never let me forget all my special memories.
See i'm only promised today,
And if it's my time to go,
I don't want the love of my life to ever fade away,
So one last time
Let me open my eyes.
To see what my life used to be like.
Oh God."

"event","I'm in one of those moods where I feel like I just need to be cheered up and I'm not really sure who can do it.  Mike and I had one of those days yesterday where all we did was argue.  I was in a good mood all day and kept trying to ignore his bad mood. Then, I'm at work last night and he comes over and gets in a confrontation with a guy I work with that is a friend of mine and that is what finally set me over the edge.  I think he knew he had finally pushed me too far after the incident.  He spent the rest of the night texting me on my phone and apologizing.  He even showed up later on that night to hang out with me at work for a little bit.  I told him I forgive him, but it better not happen again.  I don't forgive for the same thing twice.  When I got out of work he was in a good mood, but I wasn't.  

I can't say I'm still in a bad mood today, just feel a bit down.  Hopefully, that will all change.  I'm heading out fishing this afternoon after my dentist appointment.  Mike went and got some poles for us to use.  I've never caught anything yet, so hopefully today will be a first.  And hopefully, we can get along today.

I gotta figure out a vacation to go on this summer, also.  Myrtle Beach, SC is a big possibility right now....or I may just save some cash and go to the Jersey shore for a weekend and just stay with my Aunt and Uncle.  I dunno...but lately I've got the feeling where I'm just itching to get away from here for a few days.

It's looking like I'm gonna have to go with the red neon.  I can't find pink neon any easier then I can find the white.  And it figures cause pink is what I was really beginning to lean towards.  Hot pink on a white car would be so cute.  So would white on white.  But red won't be half bad either, I saw a car last night with red neon done and it was nice.  I just saved up enough for rent and this months bills, so I think I'll use next weeks tip money on my lights.

Aight, gotta go back to my place and shower up and get around to go to the dentist.  Wish me luck on fishing today!"

I worked last night, went home for about 8 hours, and was there first thing this morning.  Maybe I'll ask my manager if I can just bring a sleeping bag and start camping out?! 

Larry informed me today at work that he and I need to start hanging out again like we used too.  Larry and I were unseperable last summer.  He's probably one of the coolest people I've ever met in my life. We always have a blast hanging out together, which isn't often anymore.  His boyfriend (yes, boyfriend...he's gay) and I don't really get along well...no real reason why, just a personality clash I guess?!  I dunno.  Anyways, Larry wants time away from him because they fight all the time and he told me in that time away he wants to hang out with me because he misses all the fun we used to have.  I miss it too.  

I'm waiting for Sara to call me right now so I can go shopping with her.  I have some extra money and I'm ready to spend it on some new clothes possibly (of course, when I actually have money to spend I can never find anything I like....).  Then, I'm gonna head back to my apartment and watch the Butterfly Effect again I think.  I wanted to find someone to go fishing, but it's supposed to thunderstorm again this evening.  

Getting the neon lighting doen to my car within the next week or two I think.  Mike said he'd put it on for me, I'm thinking about going red since I did the interior and the seat covers/stearing wheel cover in red.  I wanted to do white, but white neon is expensive and hard to find.  I also considered doing pink and changing around the interior and seat covers....guess we'll see."

My dad called me on my cell phone yesterday afternoon and asked me if I had a few minutes to stop by his house.  So, I came over here to see what it was he wanted and needless to say...I was speechless when I found out.  He had been cleaning his safe out when he came acrossed Christmas and Birthday cards from back when I was very very young.  These cards were from my Grandma on his side (who died when I was only 8), my Great Aunt Clara (she died when I was 5 or 6), and my Grandma on my mom's side (who passed away this past January).  There were a ton of cards from them...and inside the cards?!  The money they had given me back then which added up to over $300 with all the cards put together.  My dad didn't give me the money back then, because he said he didn't want me to waste it on some toy that I'd only play with for a little while and then eventually throw out.  He wanted to wait until I was older and could use it on something truely meaningful.  I thought that was awesome.  The money was a nice bonus....but it was the cards that ment more to me then anything.  Here I sat, holding on and reading cards that were given to me when I was young by people who are no longer here.  Two of those people died before I was out of elementary school.  Reading those cards helped me feel closer to them.  

My Aunt Clara....I have almost no memory of her at all (I was 5 or 6 when she died), except for one.  I remember she had a friend who owned a candy shop.  She used to take me there once a week and her friend would let me pick out anything I wanted....I always picked out Tootsie Rolls.  It's my only memory of her....other then the ones I can see on my dad's old home videos he used to take (but I don't count those...because if it weren't for the video, I'd never remember those moments).  My Grandma on my dad's side...my memories of her have faded over time.  I remember going to her house Trick or Treating and I remember her letting my cousin Melissa and I spend the night over there together.  She used to watch the Price Is Right every day without fail.  I still remember, like it was yesterday, coming out of church school and my dad and mom in the car waiting for me (which I thought was odd...since they were divorced and kinda bitter towards each other on and off at that point).  I still remember them telling me Grandma had died that afternoon...and I remember I just started sobbing and screarming ""No!  No she didn't!"".  My mom still tells me to this day that my Grandma (on dad's side) was the sweetest lady in the world.  And my Grandma on my mom's side, she left us the most recently (January) so I have a ton of memories of her.  I used to always bake her fudge and brownies and all kinds of sweets.  She wasn't supposed to have them, but she loved them and would sneak them anyways (with some help from me lol).  I would go sit on the pourch with her in the summer time for hours just enjoying the weather and her company.  I miss her more then any words can say.

I took most of the money and put it in my bank to save (I had my dad put one of the $20 bills back in the safe, along with the cards, because it was from 1981 and was still in mint condition).  I found myself feeling pretty down for the rest of the day.  I found myself wondering what life would be like if Aunt Clara and my Grandma could of lived to of seen me today.  Would they be happy with how I turned out?!  Would they be proud of me?!  I like to think I know the answers to those questions.  I also got thinking about how neat it would be to just spent a day with them right now, if possible.  To actually have an intelligent conversation with them both and learn more and get to know them now as an adult, and not a young child.  

I cried alot last night.  Their cards...seeing their handwritting...reading their ""I love you""'s.  It really got to me.  It made me realize that, even if I didn't know a couple of them as well as I wish I did, I miss them tremendously."

"event","First off, this will be my final journal entry. 

This entry is mostly thoughts I've had, and is for me and me alone.  Just alot of randomness I need to sort out, and writing it down and reading it will allow me to do just that.

The past and the people in it are best left in it.  I didn't used to believe that, but after lots of thinking-I now do.  People come into your life for a reason.  We don't always know what this reason is, but it's there.  I'm grateful for every person who has ever affected my life in any way.  I'm grateful they were brought into my life for whatever reason and stayed around for awhile.  But, people grow up.  People change.  Our needs, wants, and dreams change with us.  What may of been right for us then is sometimes not what is right for us now.  I know what is right for me now.  I know what I want out of my life and who I want to be in it.  Nothing anyone says will change that or bring me down or cause me to doubt my choices.  Because in my heart of hearts, I already know the path I'm supposed to take-and I'm on it.  Will the path be a happy, trouble free path?!  Probably not.  Why?!  Because I know the happy, trouble free path and it's the one I choose not to take.  I don't want a predictable life.  I want the path untraveled.  I want the one with bends, and sharp turns, pot holes, bumps.  I want a life full of surprises, good or bad.  My friends can support my decisions and trust that I know I'm doing whats right for me right now.  Or, they can cut me down, disagree, and think I'm crazy...and in that case, I will wish them a good and happy life and let them go.  Because if you can't support me, you aren't my real friend and I have no room in my life for you.

I don't have time to be unhappy or hateful.  I'm not going to spend my life hating or being angry because that's not the life for me.  Instead, I'll forgive what I can forgive, forget what I can forget, and accept what I can not forgive or forget.  I'm going to live my life one day at a time.  I won't obsess over the past, because it's unchangeable.  I won't worry about the future because all the worrying in the world won't stop it from arriving.  I'll just take today for what it is and make the most out of every second.  I will take time out of everyday to talk with my dad, mom, and brother.  I will treat them like each day is their last...because you never really do know when you'll be right.  I will no longer take their unconditional love and acceptance for granted.  They are the ones who have been there for me since the beginning...they will be the ones standing there and still loving me at the end of time.  My friends...my second family....the brothers and sisters God forgot to give me.  Always there in a heartbeat with a smile to laugh with or a shoulder to cry on.  Their love means more then anything to me...because they don't have to love me....they choose too."

"event","Living on your own absolutely rocks.  Okay maybe it's not ALL that great, it does have its boring/lonely moments, but in the end-it's so much better in so many ways.

I got moved in easily with help from my brother, dad, and Mike.  Had the place set up just in time for my 4th of July party.  The party was fun, even though my friends already made an impression on the neighbors...and not a good one.  We were all very very drunk....Larry somehow found all the fireworks I'd put away (my dad gave Mike and I a ton of REALLY big fireworks...the kind you can't shoot off in the city or you'd be arrested ASAP).  Luckily for me, Larry only brings out the bottle rockets (I don't wanna think what else he coulda got into if he'd looked harder).  I'm in the kitchen getting another drink and talking to my Mike, while Larry, Rob, my cousin Mike, Mark, and Liz are all out on the deck.  Next thing I know, I hear: BANG!.....BANGBANGBANGBANG!  I look out and see Larry laughing his ass off as he lights rocket after rocket...and shoots it at the neighbors house!!!  I fly out the door and try to get them away from him, but being as drunk as I was I'm laughing and he isn't taking me seriously.  He keeps on shooting them as the neighbor lady steps outside just bitching away at us to quiet down and so on.  I yell for Mike, he comes out and gets the rockets away from Larry.

After everyone is gone, Mike and I are ready to go pass out (I'm very drunk, Mike is incoherently drunk).  We just get into bed, I'm almost asleep, when he says; ""I need you to get me the garbage can"".  I mumble back ""Are you serious?!""  and he slurs back; ""Yes, you really need to go get it now"".  Still not wanting to move I moan and just lay there...until I hear him start gagging.  At that point, I don't walk...I RUN to the kitchen, find the garbage can (of course, I'm so drunk I'm stumbling around like crazy in the dark of my new place...so this is taking time), get to the room and tell Mike I got it.  His response?!  ""Umm...it's too late"".  He'd thrown up all over the floor.  Great.  I was too drunk and tired to care, so I left the garbage can next to him and climb back into bed.  Only to have him BEG me to change sides with him because he wants to be by the fan.  I tell him I'm not stupid, he doesn't want to sleep where he threw up and he responds by laughing and nodding.  I told him I'd switch if he'd go to sleep-but he better remember this....

We switch sides, I'm comfy again.  Just as I'm about to sleep once more I hear; ""I really need some water"".  I ask him again if he's serious and he says he is.  I don't move right away, which leads to him telling me once again that he needs water.  I get up, I get the water.  Get back into bed.  Get comfy.  He's drinking the water, throwing up in the garbage, drinking some more water.  I'm almost asleep again when he says; ""I really need a towel"".  OHMIGOD.  So I get the towel.  Thank God, that was all.  LOL I actually find it really funny now.  He spent the whole next day telling me how sorry he was.  I forgive him though, I knew he had a lot to drink and couldn't help it-I've been in that position before.  I just made sure he knew that he owed me BIG time..and that he'd be in for it next time I wanted to drink.  lol.

I bought the movie Butterfly Effect yesterday.  My favorite movie in the world.  It's about a guy who keeps going back to the past and changing things that happend, only to come back to futures that are completely different from everything he knows and usually pretty fucked up.  Sometimes he comes back to find people who were his friend don't even know him now (due to a new course of events in his life and sometimes theirs), he comes back sometimes to find people he loved have died or that their quality of life isn't as good as it was before he changed events.  He comes back to many different scenerios.  There's been so many things in my past I've always wondered; `What if I could change that?' or `What if I had done this instead of that?'.  I wonder where I'd be in my life if I'd changed some things.  Would it be the same?!  Better?!  Worse?!  Would going back in time to change things be worth the possible side effects?!"

"event","I ran into Charlie yesterday and got the story about the wrecked computer from his point of view.  Can I just say no matter how many times I think/hear about it, I laugh hysterically?!  Charlie was laughing his ass off when he told me about it.  He said he and his dad (who was drunk) had been up just chilling, listening to music, and he decided to go to bed.  He wasn't in bed long when he heard loud crashing sounds outside in their front yard.  Charlie said he ran down stairs, to the front door, in time to see his drunken father literally THROWING the computer up in the air, picking it up, and doing it again, and again.  Charlie said he was so shocked he didn't even know what to say-he just watched.  Finally, he couldn't stand to watch anymore and went back upstairs to go to sleep.  Well, he told me a few minutes after he was back in bed his father comes into his room and sits down on the corner of his bed.  Charlie asks him what he is doing, and that's when his father put his head in his heads and says; ""I just realized there are things on there I really needed!!!"".  LMAO.  Ohmigod....Charlie's drunken dad fucking rocks!  Oh yeah, and the whole reason Charlie's dad ruined the computer?!  It was going ""too damn slow"".

Miek called me tonight from South Carolina.  He left yesterday to go down for an auction.  The place he is working at goes to North Carolina every Monday/Tuesday to auction off cars and pick up new ones.  Well, this week they went to South Carolina instead.  Not just South Carolina, Myrtle Beach.  You have no idea how jealous I am.  He was talking to me from the hotel balconey and telling me about the ocean and how he wished I were there.  I wish I were there too.  I love the ocean so much and it's been way too long since the last time I saw it.  He told me we'll have to go down there for his birthday, I agree totally.  

I'm also feeling really emotional tonight.  I sent an e-mail to Fleety.  I haven't e-mailed him in a very long time.  When he first died, I'd send them often to just talk about my feelings and let him know I hadn't forgotten him (I thought; maybe there is e-mail in heaven?!).  His birthday would of been June 27th...and I'd been thinking about him alot lately, so I sent him an e-mail that told him all about my life and happenings in it.  It broke my heart when a few hours later I checked my e-mail and found a notice of failure...that his e-mail address no longer exists.  I knew that he'd never read it....but it's just the thought that his e-mail address is gone.  The reality that he really is gone.  It's really bothering me right now.  God...you have no idea how badly I wish I could e-mail him in heaven.  Or call him there.  There's just so much I want to talk to him about and tell him.  I think he'd be really happy for me right now, because for the first time in a very long time...I'm really happy for me."

Well, if you want the truth...no one else seems to find it as funny as my brother and I do (my dad laughed alot about it too...but my brother and I were laughing so hard we were in tears and couldn't stand).  Okay, gotta go back to 3:30 yesterday morning.  I was just getting home and as I'm walking up my driveway fumbling for my keys I keep hearing this sound of something just getting demolished.  I look over acrossed the street and see Charlie's dad is outside, going to town on something....and I see Charlie standing in the doorway watching out, his mouth wide opened, looking...I dunno, baffled maybe?!  I decide it's best I don't say anything...cause his dad is really smacking something around and swearing up a storm.  

Go inside...sleep....wake up the next day and head out to my car to run a quick errand.  I look up, and I'll be damned...what remained of their computer is strew in pieces all acrossed the front yard and driveway.  LOL His dad was out there beating the shit out of their computer at 3:30 in the morning!!!  I just about died....you have to know Charlie's dad....he is not good at computers, and I used to forever be over there listening to him swear at the thing.  I was hysterical when I saw it!!  Charlie's dad saw me outside starting over there and walked out and says to me; ""I guess you see what I did to my computer last night.....yeah, it really pissed me off this time!!"".  I did all I could to maintain a somewhat straight face while he was present, conversated with him quickly...then was back in the house, laughing my ass off as I told my brother to look outside.  I got out my digital camera and took a bunch of pictures, when I get time to upload them online I'll add them to my album.  LOL I'm laughing my ass off just thinking about it.  Funnier, was watchign Charlie and his dad out there later in the day picking up the pieces in a Hefty bad.  LMAO."

"event","I had this dream last night that was so amazingly real that it's hard for me to believe it didn't happen.  In a way, the dream did happen once....three years ago.  Before I can talk about the dream, I have to go back to three years ago and a night I knew I'd always remember.

I was early April 2001, I was in Alaska...on my own personal adventure.  I'd made lots of friends there, as with an Army and Air Force base right in the area there were all kinds of people my age always around.  Two guys I used to hang out with alot were Gabriel and Ben.  They were nothing more then just good friends of mine.  Both were in the Air Force, both nice guys my age or close to it.  And I remember one night they wanted to take me out to a bon fire at a friend of their's.  We all stood around the fire and I met lots of interesting people, people I knew I'd probably never meet again, and enjoyed their company.  Half way through the night I noticed something I'd never seen before...the Northern Lights.  The sky was lit up with beautiful shades of green...red...blue...and to top it off, the stars were out and brighter then ever.  I wanted to see it better, so Gabriel walked me over to a nearby semi-truck (it belonged to the guy who's house we were at, he drove it for a living around Alaska).  He helped me climb up to the very top of it, took off his sweatshirt (despite the chill in the air) so I'd have a pillow, and we layed there for well over an hour just watching.  I still remember when I was laying there that night...I wished that moment could last forever.  I knew at that moment...that it would be a night I would never forget.  It was nothing special, just me, a new friend, laying atop a semi in the middle of Alaska, watching the stars and the Northern Lights.  I remember not wanting that night to ever end.  Seems like it was just last night when I think about it.  But it wasn't last night.  It was like a blinked and suddenly here I am, three years later.

My dream last night is what helped me remember that night, a little more clearly.  Except, in my dream...it was NOW.  Not three years ago, but it was like it was happening last night.  I was standing at the bon fire, everyone that was there three years ago was there in my dream.  Once again, the Northern Lights flared up and I wanted to go somewhere secluded, dark, and away from the fire to just enjoy them.  Gabriel and I walk back to the semi and he once again helps me climb to the top.  Only this time we don't lay down...we sit, indian style and facing each other, on top.  He looks at me for a second and finally says; ""Just wanted you to know, I've missed you and still think of you often"".  He says that, and my eyes tear up and I respond; ""I've missed all of you too so much.  I wondered if you guys would wait for my return"".  And his response to me is; ""You should of known we all were waiting here for you"".  Then, Ben starts yelling for Gabriel...telling him it's time for him to go.  He tells me he needs to go and offers to help me off the semi.  I shake my head, I don't need help off and I'm not ready to go.  He hugs me, climbs down, and I sit alone....and I'm content.

Not sure where that dream came from...all I know, is it really made me remember alot of the people I ""forgot"" about after three years.  As for Ben and Gabriel, I kept in touch with them for almost a year or so after I came home from Alaska.  Unfortunatly, I have since lost touch with both and have no possible way of tracking either of them down anymore.  I still think about them from time to time, hope they are happy and that life is going their way.  I wonder if they ever think of me...if they miss me....if they are out there somewhere, wishing they could get a hold of me.  Somethings in life, we will never know.  But my dream last night brought the memory of them back to me stronger then it has been in almost three years.  And it reminded me that they are still out there, and that I still miss them and their friendship.  Knowing that I'll probably never talk to or see them ever again sucks.  But, I wouldn't trade having the chance to know them for the short time I did for anything.  All I have now are the memories and a picture of Gabriel.  I have no picture of Ben though, only the one in my mind.

Gabriel & Ben: I hope life brings you happiness always.  Thanks for giving me your friendship.  Thanks for the memories.  Miss you..."

"event","I'm going to NYC at some point this summer.  I'm talking to Alex online and he loves it there.  He's living in a nice apartment in Brooklyn and working at an upscale hotel in their restuarant as a waiter.  Just talking to him is making me so jealous!!  I told him I wanna come vist and he really wants me too.  Not sure when it'll happen, but I'm looking towards mid-late August possibly...maybe even early September.

I got a surprise vist at work last night from Mike!  He's working four hours away from here during the weeks but yesterday afternoon a guy he works with girlfriend went into labor so he had to drive the guy back here to be with his girlfriend.  Thing is, he only had to take the guy to Elmira-and where I work is a half hour drive <i>past</i> Elmia.  He could of saved himself an hour (when you figure driving to my work is a half hour, then he had to back track a half hour) of driving time by just turning around in Elmira and heading back.  But, he instead drove the extra just to come see me for a few minutes-which I thought was very sweet.  It was kinda funny....we were dead at work and I was sitting outside talking to a guy, Chris, that I work with and we happened to be talking about Mike when Chris said ""Hey, there he is now"" and is pointing at Mike's Jeep.  I shook my head saying; ""Nah, can't be him he's outta town"".  As I'm getting those words out, I realized it was him.  I was surprised.  What made it even funnier was my horoscope the day before yesterday read: You're due for a surprise, arriving via a communication of the most unexpected kind. No, you're not usually very fond of surprises, but you might just enjoy this one. 

Oh God...Jared called me AGAIN yesterday.  This time, he was pretty much begging me to take him back-but not really coming out and saying it.  I shot him down, he told me that ""someday you'll kick yourself in the ass for this"".  I told him I was willing to take that chance.  He's so pathetic.  I really don't know why I put up with him for as long as I had.  He was a loser in every sense of the word, right down to the fact that he didn't have a job because he believed he deserved a break since he'd been working since he was 18.  I used to laugh at him everytime he said that.  FUCK YOU BUDDY!!! I've had a job since I was 16 or 17 and haven't been without one sense....does that mean I should quit my job now and live off other people because `I deserve a break'?!  How many people work from the time they are 16 until they are 60 and don't take a break?!  Thank you.  My friends didn't even like him.  To prove it, here's a few lines from Alex and I's conversation:

Starry Angel: He called and was begging me to take him back and when I told him no he said something like ""Someday you'll really regret it"".  I was like ""Umm...I'm willing to take that chance!!!""
Hugo: youll regret it?
Hugo: why is he getting a job now or something?"

"event","What a long day.  I don't even know where to begin this entry at.

I'll start with the phone call from Jared telling me he still wants to be my friend.  I felt bad, but I had to turn down the `friendship' offering.  There's too many feelings still there for me to just be his friend.  Yeah, we had a rocky relationship...but still, the good times were amazing and deep down he's a good person...if only he could kick that bad attitude of his to the curb he could do amazing things with himself.  I told him, he and I just can't be friends right now.  He didn't always treat me right (I didn't always treat him right either, trust me on that!) but he was always there for me when I needed him most.  I can't be friends with someone I'm not over yet, that's just not possible.  Part of me still feels empty without him.  I miss him from time to time.  I don't know if he misses me the same.  I like to at least pretend to myself that he does.

Then, I get to work tonight and they have THREE buses.  I walk in the door, and Larry throws all his fucking handwritten orders at me and tells me that they are mine because he's leaving.  Oh my God, I was ready to fucking hit him.  I went right up to the manager and made it clear that is Larry leaves and sticks me with a full dining room I was walking out the door right behind him.  I was seriously going to kill him tonight.  Manager makes him stay, yet I dunno why he bothered staying-he didn't do a fucking thing.  I got into it with him, I was so mad...Larry gets pissed I'm yelling at him and tells me he's gonna just leave and go home and then I'll have to do all his side work too, if I don't stop yelling at him.  I laugh at him and tell him to just go ahead and leave cause he isn't doing anything anyways.  He stayed around awhile longer and claimed he did all his sidework-then left.  I waited until I knew he was gone and made BOTH managers who were there follow me around as I pointed out every single thing he didn't do.  They both agreed with me that it was ridiculous and I made sure he got a nice fat write up out of it!!  I'm such a bitch when you cross me.  Friend or not.  Cross me.  Be prepared.

I got slammed at work all evening alone.  On top of the shit with Larry, the other server called off-leaving just me on a Sunday night.  And we are always busy Sunday evenings!!  I made $90 in under four hours...but the stress didn't make the money worth it.  I was so happy later on in the evening, after it FINALLY died out, when I looked up and saw Mike had came into visit.  I took my break and stood outside and talked with him for awhile.  We were debating if we should make plans when I get outta work, but I didn't get out until midnight and he was tire and his allergies were bothering him bad (pollen...my brother and mom go through the same thing, thank God it doesn't affect me!) so we decided on tomorrow instead.

Aight, nighty night time."

"event","Last night waas my little brother's 21st birthday.  What a blast!  I ended up being at work until midnight, but as soon as I got out I met up with him, his girlfriend, and some of his other friends at the bar they were at.  I walk in and my brother is already three sheets to the wind.  I've never really seen my brother drunk before, it was absolutely amusing.  A few minutes after arriving at the bar, I run into a group of guys I graduated high school with.  I tell them I'm there for my brothers 21st and the next thing I know; they are all buying him shots.  I'm telling my brother to slow down, be careful, cause I know he's a lightweight (never been big on drinking, really).  He does the shots, it starts going on 1:30 in the morning and I tell my brothers girlfriend we should get him home because he's just absolutely retarded by this point.  She's on his left, I'm on his right...his arms are around our little shoulders and we're trying to pretty much walk him out to her car.  We get to her car and she lets go of him to unlock her passenger door.  I'm holding him up just fine, until his whole body just suddenly goes limp and the next thing I know he's falling down on the blacktop and pulling me down with him.  I get up and Katie comes running over to help me get him off the ground.  I have one arm, she has the other, but all the pulling in the world can't lift him.  He's just laying there, body completely limp, laughing his ass off, refusing to cooperate with us.  I'm telling him he needs to calm down and help us get him up, and he's laughing at me saying ""I see two of you right now and I don't know which one to listen too!!"".  I don't know how, but we finally get him off the ground and in her car.  I followed them to the house and the next challenge....getting him upstairs to his room.

We manage it somehow.  We get him to his room, I let Katie change him and wait out of the room.  Get back in there and he's drunk telling me he has to take out his contacts.  I cringe, then manage to get over it and I take his contact lenses out for him.  Katie gets him into his bed and I bring him a bottled water and tell him to drink up so he doesn't wake up too dehydrated in the morning.  He begins drinking and suddenly says ""I'm gonna puke"".  Katie and I get him to the bathroom just in time for him to hug the toliet and puke.  He spends almost na hour just throwing up and gagging.  Ew.  I had to leave the bathroom the smell and the sounds were making me feel like I was gonna be throwing up next.  Katie's a saint...that girl sat in there with him the whole time.  Dunno how she did it, but glad she did.  By this point it's well after 3am and I have to pee and go to bed because I have to be to work at 9.  So, I go to the bathroom and ask Matt if he can leave for a minute just so I can pee quickly.  He CRAWLS outta the bathroom, gets right outside the door and just falls flat on the floor.  Funniest thing I ever saw in my life, seriously.  I use the bathroom, then go check in on my brother (Katie managed to get him back in his bed), I told Katie to make sure he fell asleep on his side or his stomach, then I was off to bed.

What a night!  LOL At least he had a great birthday.  When I got up this morning, I asked him if he wanted to go out and drink tonight to see what he'd say-he declined immediatly lol.  It'll be awhile before I get him to the bar again.  But, I had fun seeing my angelic brother beyond wasted."

So I feel like I'm in the wrong and that I've done something to deserve this kind of treatment.  But what, really, have I done besides stick up for myself?!

"event","I just got back in from spending the evening out.  I didn't stay as long as I had planned (the club is open until 3) because I was over come with too many emotions.

Tonight was Alex's last night out with us.  Monday, Alex moves away to NYC to start a new job and a new life.  I really am happy for him and the fact that he's found his place in the world.  But I'm sad for me and the fact that I'm not sure I'll ever see him again.  It's hard to let go of people.  I'll never forget a conversation my mom and I had together a long time ago.  While I can't remember it word for word, I just remember that it was about the fact that people will always come and go from your life as long as you are alive.  Sometimes they move away, sometimes they die, but reguardless...they leave you and they leave behind their memories you shared.  You can't stop them from going.  You just have to accept it and be grateful that they crossed paths with you, even for a short amount of time.

I'll never forget tonight.  Alex was already standing outside the club when I arrived, wearing a blue and white striped button up shirt.  He was so excited when I came around the corner and we made eye contact.  He hugged me so hard, he lifted me right up off the ground and spun me.  He told me it was about time I had arrived.  We walked inside together and I stood at the bar with him while he ordered his drink.  Conversating about everything...everything except for the fact that he was leaving.  After a bit, he was semi-drunk and ready to dance.  Alex is a goofy dancer (think Stiffler in American Wedding when he is dancing at the gay club-their techniques in dancing are so simliar it's eerie.), he almost does robot like motions with his arms-while making hysterical facial expressions.  I'm not sure if he is doing it because he thinks it's sexy or if he's trying to goof off (never had the nerve to ask), but none the less...it's Alex and it's how he dances.  It was alot of fun.  Soon though, Alex noticed that it was going on one and sadly told us all it was time he left.  He needed his sleep tonight, for he has much packing to do tomorrow and Sunday.  He made he way around the club to say his goodbyes and when he got to me, my eyes were already over flowing with tears.  He brushed them away and gave him a bear hug.  ""Don't cry"", he says.  I just sniff my nose and shake my head sadly in response.  He hugs me again...this hug lasts awhile...I breath and I smell the cologne he wears (Abercrombie) faithfully.  I don't want to let go, but I know finally it's time and we pull apart.  He looks me in the eyes sadly, gives me a half smile that I think was supposed to reassure me, and then with a slow turn his back faces me and the rest of his friends and he is too soon out the door.  And I watch sadly as one of the coolest, nicest, funniest people I have ever met walks outta our lives...forever.  

I can't say I'll NEVER see him again.  But most likely?!  Probably not.  Sure, maybe we'll talk on IM and the phone on occassion.  That's not the same though.  Been there, done that.  We may talk frequently at first...but time passes, people grow apart, and eventually...when you do meet up-it's not the same as it once was.  Guess that is what the memories are for.  I'll always have pictures to look back on, I'll always remember the times we went out to eat, the night I crashed at his house drunk and was terrified of his dogs (two full grown Saint Bernards)), his nicknames and the way he'd pick on people when we'd go to bars/clubs, Six Flags, walking around campus with him.  I can still smell his cologne.....

In the end, all of this makes me realize something.  It makes me realize just how much we take the people in our lives for granted.  We always assume they'll be there.  Tomorrow, the day after, the next day after that, next week, next month, next year.  We never picture that someday a day will come when they won't be there.  I really am going to do my best to stop taking the people in my life for granted.  I'm going to do everything in my power to enjoy every single second with them, as it happens.  I'm not going to assume that there will always be tomorrow-instead, I'm going to assume that we only have today."

Got a new nose stud today.  Jesus did it hurt putting it in.  The screw on the back was a little more closed in then the previous one I had in was.  I took out my old nose ring and went to put the new one in and I had a hell of a time.  While I was in the middle of trying to get it through, Charlie came over.  I had poor old Charlie yanking on my nose and trying to push the stupid thing through and he couldn't get it either.  I could get the old one through, no problem, but not the stupid new one.  After over an hour of fucking with it, my nose was so damn sore I put an earring in it to hold it open and let it rest.  I was so irritated by that point, it wasn't even funny.  I was throwing and slamming things all over the house just out of pure anger (yeah, I dunno why I let something so stupid piss me off like that...just the mood I'm in today, I guess).  I was just bitching up and storm and I told my dad I was giving it one more try and if I didn't get it in I was gonna be super-bitch for the rest of the day.  I walk into the bathroom, take the earring out, and this time the nose stud slides right in.  Watching me...you would of never believed I had spent over an hour struggling with it!!!  My dad was like ""It went in because you were mad"".  Agh.  At least it's in place now and my nose has a pretty little white stud in it.

I'm going out to the club tonight for the first time since....January?!  God, it's been a long time I know that much.  I miss everyone there so much-I was a regular there last summer and became really close with all the other regulars and the employees there.  There are two reasons I'm going tonight.  One, is that my good friend Alex is moving to NYC this next week and it's his last time going out tonight.  After tonight, I dunno when I'll get to see him again...if ever.  And second, I know college is out so alot of my friends from last summer are now home and I'm hoping to run into the bunch of them tonight.  If the place is anything like last summer, I know I'll have a good time.

It's been almost 10 years that he's been gone now...and amazingly, I still remember his birthday every year.  I miss him.  Think about him from time to time.  Wonder how life would be now if he was still around.  Then I remind myself he is still around us, we just can't see him.  Happy Birthday, Anthony.

It's storming out.  Again.  Big surprise.  I don't think a day has gone by in the past week where it hasn't stormed or rained at least twice.  Yuck.

Went out to lunch today with my brother and his girlfriend/ex girlfriend/whatever she is now.  It was odd...I call my brothers cell phone to see if he wants to go to the Chinese buffet with me for lunch, and when he answers and I ask he tells me he and Katie just walked in there and invites me to join them.  I ate so much that I had to come home and lay in bed for it all to digest...agh I felt so sick.

My mom noticed yesterday that I've lost weight.  I walked into her house and that was one of the first things she said to me.  She asked how I did it and I told her: water and Diet soda.  No more drinking Coke from the time I get up until I go to bed.  I limit myself to a couple Diet PEPSI's (yes...you heard correctly...ever since I became a Diet drinker, I became a Pepsi drinker.  I hate the Diet Coke after taste...) and at least 8 glasses of water every day.  

Okay, time for me to go download more ring tones for my phone."

"event","Work tonight was one big disaster.  I knew by going to work I was pushing myself way too hard, but I wanted the $$$ so bad I didn't really care.  So, here I was two days outta surgery and waiting tables with a worthless right arm.  It was the hardest thing I have ever done, and one of the most painful.  We got killed.  One of the busiest Sundays I have every worked and it was just hell.  For one, I was working with Amy-and she just plain sucks as a server.  She maybe takes one table to every three or four that I take.  I had all these big tables and a bad arm, while she was taking a small table here and there.  At one point, I had taken three tables in a row (parties of 3, 5, and 6) when a table of 8 walks in.  I seat them and tell Amy they are hers.  She looks at me and says ""Oh, I don't want them.""  I tell her; ""It's your turn, my shoulder hurts, take them!"".  She says again ""I don't want them"".  And I tell her ""It isn't about what you want, it's YOUR turn!"".  She looks at me and says ""You're really going to make me take them?!"".  At this point Chris, one of the cooks who over heard the whole thing and does not like Amy, snapped at her and said ""Jesus Amy, take the God damn table it's your turn!  You need to take turns!!!"".  So, she took them.  About two minutes later after this incident she comes up to me outback and says; ""I would like to see this so called shoulder of yours before I take any more tables tonight"".  I look her right in the eyes and tell her in my most sarcastic, bitchy voice ""Sure thing sweetheart, the bandage comes off Tuesday and you can check it out all you want...I'll even make a special trip down to show you it if you want."" and I walked out of the dishroom.  Dumb bitch.  Ugh.  That girls gets on my nerves.

After work I decided to go to the Super Walmart for a few odds and ends.  I walk in and right in the front entrace is Chris (cook from work) and Jason (works next door at the movie theater) and two of Chris's friends all beating on some soda machine that stole there money.  Ended up chatting with them for a bit, then went in and bought a new cd (Def Leppard Greatest Hits) and some new scented body sprays.  

And...now here I am, bored and wide awake at ten of two in the morning.  Oh yeah, and in immense pain from pushing myself at work tonight.  Ouch.  My poor shoulder, it's never gonna heal at this rate."

"event","The surgery on my shoulder went well.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  I had a picture of this Jekyl like dude standing over me with a rusty saw and sawing my shoulder open.  Obviously, it was nothing of the sort.  The doctor I had was actually mad cool...very talkative and a bit of a smart ass which I actually found made me relax,laugh, and feel at ease with him.  I was awake for the procedure, my arm was numbed up really well.  I didn't watch him do it, I turned my head to the left and kept focus on a poster that hung on the wall.  It was a poster with an angel on it and underneath it listed all the things in life you're Guardian Angel wants you to know.  It was the cutest thing I ever read and it kept me occupied.  I didn't feel any sharp pain when he was working on my shoulder, but I did feel a burning.  It burned more and more as it went on.  After it was done, I headed home and realized how tired out I was from being so drugged up.  Ended up passing out asleep for over 3 hours.  

They have me on Vicadin...but I don't think I'm going to take it anymore.  At first, the way it made me feel was fun.  My shoulder didn't hurt and I felt a cross between being high and being drunk.  While that was neat, the other effects weren't.  I was light headed, dizzy, I couldn't even walk without losing balance.  Hell, I was even standing in one spot talking with my brother and lost balance because I was just so light feeling.  This morning, when I sat up in bed and once again felt so light headed I thought I was going to be sick...I decided to hell with the Vicadin...I'll take the pain. 

Went out last night, had a lot of fun.  Ended up getting drunker then I ment too (prolly due to the Vicadin) and spent an hour playing darts with my bad shoulder because I was so drunk I couldn't feel anything.  Paying for that one today.  Trust me.  Ouch.  I called off of work from the amount of pain I was in then went to the bar, got drunk, and played darts.....Jesus...if only my manager could of seen me then...can we say WRITE UP?!  Oh well, I am still in considerable pain today but I'm going to work reguardless.  I need the $$$$.

Found out that there is going to be a Skynard concert coming up in mid-June.  I'm going to make sure I get that night off from work cause I really wanna go.  Not sure when I became a Skynard fan but lately I'm really into it.

Oh yeah, the diet I was doing?!  That lasted maybe two days before I said THE HELL WITH THIS.  Sorry, but I just couldn't get used to living without the foods I love-and the things that were cut out were the things I loved most.  Instead, I just stuck with the switch to Diet Soda and water and eliminated regular soda all together.  And, I've seen results from that alone.  You have to understand, I'm a total Coke (the cola) addict.  I had to have it from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed-it was all I would drink.  So, what I do now is drink water all day long and have one MAYBE two DIET sodas in place of the twelve pack of Coke I was going through daily.  In one week, I've dropped 8 pounds and one pant size.  Discovered the pant size thing when I was shopping at Old Nazy and realized that my normal size was too big and the next size down was perfect.  Confirmed the pant size drop when I went to Rue 21 and the same thing-regular size too big, next size down just right.

I told myself, only one week or this and if I don't see any results it's OVER!!

My brother came home from Florida yesterday.  It was nice to see him again, but the quiet house that I became accustomed too was not so quiet (he's a loud mouth).  We picked him up from the airport in Rochester then spent time shopping around the area.  I was rather unimpressed with the clothing selection, I ended up buying the first season on Friend's on dvd (laugh away...it's my fav. show).  

Found out I'm going to be having a form of surgery this coming Friday.  A mole I have on my shoulder started turning weird and then began bleeding on and off all the time.  Got it looked at and discovered there are cancerous cells in it.  Soooo....they made me an appointment ASAP to get it removed.  I'm not so much worried about the cancer (been there, done that) as I am the removal of it.  I'll be awake during the proceedure.  I've had some people tell me it'll be uncomfortable, some say it'll hurt, others say I won't feel a thing.  I don't know who to believe.  It's not even the pain that bothers me....it's knowing I will be awake and fully aware while they cut my shoulder open and stitch it up.  Sick.  That's one day I can't wait to get the hell over with.

Work went alright tonight.  Was a normal Sunday, not overly busy-but decent tips.  That all changed when I got a bus of high schoolers.  They were from Jersey, had been up at Niagra Falls for something and on there was home the one bus broke down so they all squeezed into one bus to come eat since they were famished.  I usually hate people on buses...they are so rude, impatient, and demading...but these guys weren't!  They were so laid back and poliet and I adored them for it.  Before they left, a couple of the guys gave me and Michelle (she was manager tonight) hugs and told us thank you.  I thought that was very sweet.  The best part was the guy that was paying for everything, he told me he was going to give me a tip worth bragging about-and he then gave me a $50 tip.  $50!!!!  Hell yeah.  Chris (a cook) looked at me astonished and said ""It is so not fair...I'll have made about $20 on my paycheck by the time I leave tonight, and you're walking out with $90 from tips alone tonight"".  Ha ha ha.  I may bitch about my job, but in the end-I <3 it.

I'd been ignoring it, until this week...when it started bleeding for no reason at all.  And by bleeding, it wasn't just a little blood....I would completely soak through three paper towels before the bleeding would slow down.  Went to the doctors,- got it examined, found out it's cancerous and that's why it's been bleeding on and off for the past week.  I now have an appointment for next Friday at one thirty to have it removed.  It's a ten to fifteen minute proceedure, from what I was told. Ouch. Not looking forward to this.

I'm going on the Atkin's diet. My friends laugh at me and tell me I'm absolutely insane.  I know I'm not fat at all, I have a nice figure (according to guy friends), but with ten-fifteen pounds less...mmmmmhhhmmmm.

Agh I'm so bored.  Kraig wants me to go out to the club with him tonight.  Part of me really wants to go since I haven't gone out there in ages and I miss everyone there, but I have to get up at eight in the morning to drive to Rochester and pick my brother up from the airport.  He doesn't get in until after one, but I wanna get there early so I can do a little shopping at the mall nearby.  I figure if I leave here by nine, I'll be to Rochester by 10:30ish or so and then I'll have a couple hours to roam the mall.

I've been spending almost every day laying out and working on my tan.  It's not even so much the tan I care about...but laying out under the sun is just so relaxing.  I went and bought a new bikini yesterday afternoon.  My neighbor went with me and I had him pick out which one I should get.  Of course, he picks out one with a LOT less material then the ones I was looking at.  He picks out a camouflage one that has flourecent yellow strings to tie it on (the strings on the top piece tie around your neck and back, the bottom piece ties on at your hips).  I thought it was cute, but wasn't sure it was something I could pull off...yet Charlie kept INSISTING that it was perfect for me and I had to get it (he told me the color would go perfect with my tan and my hair/eye color...I responded by asking him if he was gay).  I gave in and tried it on in the dressing room and realized it really was cute...so, I went ahead and got it.  I wore it out today and the more I wear it, the more I like it.  I'm still thinking about going back to the mall and buying the one I had wanted (it was a two piece that was a bright blue) so that way I can have a few swim suits to go between this summer and I don't always have to wear the same one.

I got my first pair of Night and Day contact lenses yesterday.  Wore them to bed for the first time last night, woke up this morning and was really impressed.  It was nice to be able to wake up and see clearly right off the bat, not have to fumble around for things, and it didn't feel like I was even wearing contacts.  Big difference from any other pair I've ever owned. I couldn't even take a nap in the other ones for too long, or my eyes would be dried out and itchy afterwards. Hurrah for technology.

It's funny how quiet the house is without him around...and how amazingly lonely I feel already and he's only been gone for a little bit over an hour.  Oh well...hope he has a good time, takes lots of pics, gets me something nice, and meets lots of tan hotties.

As for me...today has just been long and unending.  Took my car to the garage today to get the passenger door fixed (wouldn't unlock from the outside) and the people in there were so rude.  I walk in and tell them I have an appointment to have it fixed today and this guy (a mechanic...sitting there, arms folded, not doing a damn thing) says loudly ""I don't have any appointments today"".  I check my planner and explain that I have it marked down for TODAY.  He says to me ""I told you I didn't make any God damn appointments today with anyone!"".  So, I looked at him and said ""You're right, I didn't make an appointment with you...she made it for me!"" and I point to the lady behind the desk who is sitting there chewing her gum loudly and twirling her hair like she doesn't have a brain.  She slowly pulls her ass outta the chair and waddles over to a big book and after a minute or two (I'm not, like, sure she could, like, read?!) says ""She's right, she does have an appointment today"".  The guy throws his ass, makes all these loud obnoxious sighing sounds, and slams himself again the back of his seat.  The lady finally reaches out for my keys...and I was like FUCK them...I shot the guy the dirtest look I could manage, THREW my keys on the counter (ignroing her out stretched hand), and informed them I would be back shortly after four and that my car had better be done (and it was).

While that was being done, my brother had to drop me off at work for the day.  I was the only server on, one manager was on, and one cook.  We weren't just busy....we got our asses handed to us.  I was ready to just quit...it was that bad.  I couldn't keep up, customers were being rude because everything was taking f-o-r-e-v-er, people were coming in faster then I could clear off tables to seat them at, and NO ONE WAS HELPING ME.  To make it better, this older lady backed into me so hard that the glass I had in my hand SHATTERED IN MY HAND and the soda in the glass went all over me...the floor.  She felt bad, it was an accident...just not a plesant one.  I wasn't mad at her, just irritated at the situation I was in at the moment.

After work, I was so tired that as soon as I got my car from the garage (and I must say, when I returned to get it the bubble gum lady couldn't be sweet enough) I came home and went right to bed.  I was almost asleep when my cell phone began ringing and it was Larry begging me to hang out.  I told him repeatedly NO I am tired, I want to chill tonight, spend time with my brother before he leaves, so on.  Does Larry listen?!  No.  He shows up at the door an hour later.  I manager to stop my dad before he gets to the door and tell him to tell Larry I went with Sara somewhere and I'm not home.  That backfires on me.  Larry tells my dad ""Oh okay, I'll go over to Sara's house and see what they are up too!""  LOL.  So, I'm now calling Sara's cell phone and telling her whats up (luckily, she wasn't home lol she found it funny).  Then, an hour later, Larry shows back up at my house...I knew I couldn't dodge him this time...my light in my room had been on so he knew I was there.  So, I decide to go hang out with him...say goodbye to my brother....get out to Larry's Jeep, climb in...and he sits there a second and says ""You know what?!  Let's hang out another time, actually...."".  I just shook my head, asked if he was joking (which he wasn't), shrugged and got bck outta the Jeep and went back inside my house in disbelief.  He bugged me all night to do that?!  

Shortly after, Matt left for Florida.  I told him to get me a cute tee-shirt or shot glasses or some kind of nice souvenier.  Then, went to Wal Mart with my dad for some odds and ends and...well, here I am.  Yep, that was my eventful day.

Maybe it's bed time?!  I plan on being out late tomorrow night so I need to catch many zzzzzz's tonight."

The weather has been awesome for the past week or so now, every day it's been in the 80's.  For the most part, it's been sunny (with occasional thunderstorms...we're about to get one right now, again) and just really nice.  I woke up a little before ten and laid out until around one.  Around one, went to the tanning salon with my brother (he's been going to get a base tan since he leaves for Florida Friday and doesn't wanna get burned once he gets there). Got home...now it's thundering...so I'm in here chilling. 

Kinda pissed off about something, but not something I'm in the mood to talk about at the moment.  I'll wait until I get a hold of the person first and make sure that I'm pissed off for a reason (hard to explain beyond that right now).

Ick.  I'm watching the Weather channel right now (to see what the rest of the week brings) and would you believe in parts of the US it's 32 degrees?!  Jesus.  I'm so glad our winter is over, I couldn't take anymore of that 30 degree shit.

Alright...so this was really a pointless entry...but it was something to amuse me for a few minutes."

"event","Wow...it's been about a week since the last time I was online.  Probably because, lately, I just don't have much free time.  My work is so fucking understaffed that the manager is over working us.  The worst part is the way he treats us anymore...he has his favorites, and his favorites are the friends of HIS that he hired for that very reason.  The one, is schedualed ONE day a week...and for the past two straight weeks, called off on her one day.  But it was okay for her to call off, he didn't mind (after all, she's his buddy).  I covered for her the first time, canceled my plans, and stayed....kept the bitching to a minimum since I could use the extra cash.  Second time, OH HELL NO.  He asks me to cover for her again and I told him ""Absolutely....NOT!"".  I won't be Laurie's back-up bitch for when she feels like calling in.  I was not going to cancel plans AGAIN because she called off-fuck that.  Who got in trouble though?!  Not Laurie for calling off the second time in a row in two weeks...ME because I said there was no way in hell I would stay.  My manager was bitching and was like ""Well, fine..you can call around and find someone to cover for her!"".  I rolled my eyes and said ""Tell me something, who's the manager here you or me?!  Because I must be confused..."".  I also went off on him the other day and told him if he thinks I'm going to be putting in 40 + hours over the summer, he's off his fucking rocker-so he better get his ass in gear and hire more people.  

My birthday came and went....the day was an alright one.  My dad gave me a dvd (on top of the money for my new car), my mom gave me a microwave, a silverware set, and other kitchen odds n ends for when I get an apartment, Grandpa sent me roses, Michelle (one of the shift managers at my work) got me some fuzzy red dice to hang from the mirror of my car, Jared got me the American Wedding dvd, and my brother bought me a couple cd's.  I ended up going out that night with a group of my friends (Sara, Larry, Jared, and Kraig) and that was alot of fun.  All the bars gave me free birthday drinks, and people were buying me all kinds of shots.  At the last bar we went to I asked the bartender if I got a free drink and she was like ""Ummm...we don't do that here...must be at the other places you were the bartenders were male if they were giving you drinks"".  I told her, actually, they were all female.  A few minutes later she comes back over and was like ""I'll buy you a shot, how's that?!"" Sure!  Yeah, I was pretty freakin drunk that night.

Hmmmmmmmmmm what else is going on.  Ohhhhhh......Friday.  I get a phone call that surprised me.  From Mike.  I talked about him in earlier journal entries, the ones I erased.  He wanted to hang out.  At first, I considered blowing him off like he had me...making plans, then just not following through.  Then I realized, I'm a better person then that.  And, I'm also the kind of person that believes everyone fucks up and everyone deserves second chances.  We ended up hanging out Friday night and he was really apologetic over everything and seemed sincere.  He called me Saturday and we talked and hung out, and we hung out for awhile Sunday too.  When he came over Sunday, he had a red and a pink rose for me which surprised me-but was really nice.  I'm not sure what I think of any of this right now.  Only time will really tell.  I'd like to believe he's sincere.  But, he's tricked me before.

Aight...I'm gonna go shower and run my million and one errands.  Hopefully, it won't be another week before I'm able to have the time to get online again.

Take care, everyone."

Birthday time...this way the time I really missed Fleet last year.  It was my first birthday without him, last year.  He never needed to be reminded, he always knew when it was.  I'd get gifts in the mail, a phone call, a bunch of pre-birthday e-mails all week, then on the day of my birthday...I'd get a really nice e-mail from him.  This year...I miss him even more, and I also have another person to miss...Grandma.  No Birthday cards from her this year (although, last years still sits on my dresser...), she can't call me up and wish me a happy one.  And that sucks.

I was at work tonight, Fleet was on my mind.  He's been on my mind alot lately.  I found myself asking him...if he's out there and hears me, to give me a sign between now and my birthday.  Something, anything.  But something I would know was a real sign...from him.  I don't really expect one, but asking doesn't hurt.

Oww...the back of my legs and my right arm/shoulder are so sore right now.  I spent the other day playing baseball with my brother for a couple hours.  He'd pitch me the ball and I'd hit it (he's a pitcher for a league in the summer, so he likes to practice...and I love to hit...so it works) and we did this for ove two hours.  I'm paying for it now, but it was fun (and I got one hell of a nice tan).

Okay, maybe I'm losing it...but I think Jessica Simpsons remake of ""Take My Breath Away"" is so amazing (none of my friends agree, but to each their own..).  The video is on MYV right now...guess that's what made me think of it...cause I even think the video is cute.

"event","Today was the most beautiful day we've had so far this spring.  It was 80 degrees, sunny, and perfect.  I knew as soon as I woke up this morning that I wanted to spend the day OUTSIDE.  Jared called me this morning, I ended up going to get him and we went to Harris Hill to hang out for awhile.  Harris Hill is one of the most beautiful places in the world, especially if you go to the look out.  There's four or five metal bench swings there that people go and sit on and you can look at the Appalachin mountains and the valley and just have this amazing view.  I used to go there alot last summer, alone, when I wanted to think.  I'll probably spend many hours there this summer as well.  I found a website that had a picture of the look out so I'll post the addy and anyone interested, just copy and paste it and check it out.  And just for the record, I have NO clue who the lady in the pic is!!!!  http://www.angelfire.com/nj4/enterprise/Harris.jpg

After that, we went to the mall and wandered for a bit, had lunch, then I headed home.  I wanted to go to Cowanesque Lake (it's just over the border in PA)for the evening SO bad but everyone I called was either working or didn't answer there phones.  So, I instead went over and spent some time with my mom.  With my birthday coming up on Tuesday, I spent the evening listening to her harrass me and remind me that in 7 years I'll be turning thirty (7 years?!  Agh...does NOT seem possibly at all...).  We also discussed what to do for my birthday....I told her I'd like to have a few people over for cake and ice cream.  Probably Sara, Larry, Jared, my brother, my mom's boyfriend, and I'm going to see if my Grandpa would like me to pick him up and bring him over as well. 

I went through my journal today and erased ALOT of entires and edited others.  Guess I just figured there are certain things in the past I just would rather forget.  I'm emotionally drained as it is and everytime I sign on and check out my journal...I go re-read those entries and just feel...horrible, about myself, about the situation, about how things turned out.  Tonight, I just said the hell with it.  I can't erase that it happened...but I can erase it from my journal."

"event","My emotions have just been a wreck lately and I wish I knew why, but I don't.  The STUPIDEST things upset me...things that normally wouldn't even phase me have me in tears.  I think a lot has to do with the fact my Uncle isn't well and the fact that we just found out my Grandpa has lung cancer.  

I JUST lost my Grandma is January...she was the world to me, I loved that lady so damn much.  My Grandma was the sweetest person in the whole wide world....and she adored me in a way no one else ever will. I miss going over to her house and seeing the way her face would light up when I'd walk in.  I miss sitting on the pourch with her on hot days, like today, and talking for hours on end.  I miss listening to her talk lovingly to her cat, that kitty was her baby.  I want her to come back so damn bad.  I remember being in the intensive care unit the day she died...January 8th....and I thought there was no way she was dying.  She was sitting up in her bed talking away and everything was just ""normal"".  But she knew...it was her time...she was tired of fighting...she was ready to go (which was why she signed the `do not resescitate' papers the prior day)...and at one o'clock they took her off all machines.  I held her hand until she passed away, at ten after three that afternoon.  It was a bitter cold January day, the ground was covered in fresh, white snow...the sun was shining brightly.... I remember standing there next to her, the whole family was there with her.  I had her left hand, my cousin Josh had her right hand, my Aunt Nancy was patting her hair, everyone else crowded in close.  Everyone telling her it was okay for her to go, that we would be fine, that we loved her, that we would all see her again someday.  I remember hearing myself saying; ""It's okay to leave now, Grandma...."" but I didn't mean it...in my heart and my head I was praying to God...barganing.  ""PLEASE GOD...don't take Grandma away.  I'll do anything...ANYTHING...I'd give up ANYTHING...ANYTHING...just don't take her away from me...I'll give up my job, my friends, my belongings...just don't take her"".  But he did.  And now, almost four months later...I'm still trying to find a way to accept that...and I can't.  This Tuesday will be the first birthday she won't call me up and wish me a happy one.  I won't find a birthday card in the mail from her this year, either.  I'm going to miss that.  That was always something I looked forward too.

God....you can't take my Grandpa away from me right now....I'm just not ready to handle that.


Grandma:  When morning came and you weren't there 
And night time came and you still weren't there 
Then for me there never was a day..."

Been trying to find metalic white windshield wiper blades for my car.  Do you know how hard it is to find them?!  I've looked everywhere...lots of blues, reds, purples, silvers, no white.  The one place I did find white, they had only two sizes and neither one were right.  I'm gonna go back there tomorrow and see if they can special order them for me in the size I need.  After the blades, I begin to do the neon lights (I'm going all red with those).  There's already been a lot of work done on my car, person before me put ground effects on it, low profile tires, chrome rims, and a new customized front bumper (I didn't even know half this stuff was done until a guy I work with pointed it all out to me).  I <3 the person who owned the car before me...but they just got a small start on it for me...

Something I find funny....my parrot had layed THREE eggs this week.  Weird, huh?!  I mean...I know birds lay eggs, but never really thought about a parrot laying eggs.  So, I now know that Spankee is indeed female.

I have to work tonight and I'm dreading it.  It's rainy, chilly, and I just don't see it being a busy night.  Which means, we'll spend half the night sitting in the dining room playing cards and goofing off...which is fun sometimes, but gets boring fast.

"event","Death.  An inevitable part of life.  Something that has been thought about and discussed alot today.  Why?!  Because one of my mom's students was killed in a fatal car accident last night during a bad thunderstorm.  I didn't even know there had been an accident when I pulled up at my mom's today after work (showing off my BEAUTIFUL new car)...then when I got there, I could just see it in her face that something was wrong and when I asked-it was more then I had expected.  Understandably, she felt pretty sad about it and even hearing about it made me feel bad.  Then somehow we got on the topic of how many people have died from my class since we graduated, not even five years ago.  The number?!  Believe it or not there has been 4 (that I know of).  And yeah, considering I had a class of two hundred and something maybe four isn't bad...but I still think 4 people in less then five years is pretty sad.  If you want to count the ones who passed away during high school, the number nearly doubles.

Out of the 4 that passed after graduation, I was only friends with one of them. I'd hung out with Ross since I was in middle school. You couldn't NOT like Ross, because Ross liked everyone.  He was laid back, out going, and he wasn't the type of person who would talk about people.  You'd see him hanging out with the popular kids just as often as you'd see him talking to the ""outcasts"".  He didn't judge people, he didn't care what others thought of someone.  I wish I could of be more like he was.  My mom loved Ross, he used to come over to her house alot and sit on the front pourch with me for hours just talking.  He'd call the house for me, and if I wasn't there-he's chat with my mom.  When I had a car accident a few years ago, he'd come pick me up and take me to the college for class and he'd stay an hour longer then he had to just so I'd have a ride home as well.  I asked my mom, tonight, if she remember the day...a couple summers ago...when we were at the gas station and Ross came pedaling up to us on his bike (explaining that his mom had a car accident so he was letting her use his car to get to and from work for the time being) and spent a few minutes talking with us.  She thought for a second and nodded; ""Yeah, I remember that day"".  I was quiet for a second then I told her that was the last time I ever saw him alive.  And she nodded slowly and quietly.  And I sat there and remembered watching him pedal away from us, waving, and saying he'd stop in to see me at my work one of these days....

Wow.  My eyes are watering up so badly right now...but my entry isn't done just yet.

Another case where death seems to be a possibility today...we found out my Uncle has something wrong with his heart.  We aren't sure what just yet, but he was transferred to a hospital an hour away from here.  He may have to have open heart surgery.  No one knows much for sure right now.  I didn't think it was that bad, until my dad came and asked me to clean my room up because my Aunt's from Jersey may be coming up tomorrow to stay with us so they can be here for him.

Only downside of the new car...went to get my insurance around for it and found out I'm now going to pay $200 a month for insurance.  All due to the fact it's a sports car, pretty new, and a car that tends to be stolen frequently (I have bad luck as it is...I didn't wanna hear that).  It sucks...but it'll be worth it...especially when I get the body/ground effects kits in place.

Hung out with Sara for awhile last night, sat on her front pourch and enjoyed the warm spring evening (until it got windy and began downpouring out of nowhere lol).  Then watched Real World/Road Rules Inferno and the MTV show I Want a Famous Face.  I knew the guy, Jesse, that was on it.  Last I knew, he was dating my friend Alex (not sure if they still are, but I do know Alex was flying out to Vegas again soon and I assume it is to see Jesse). 

Well....not much really planned today.  Larry wants me to go to some party with him tonight, I told him ""We'll see"".  I'm not sure I feel like partying really.

"event","I GOT A NEW CAR!!!!!!!  Okay, now that I've got that outta my system, I'm going to save the best for last (the new car) and talk about my night last night.

Larry and I went out to the club, and it was a crazy night.  We were already beyond drunk when we arrived (thanks to our mixture of vodka, with a splash of orange juice lol) and we get there and just keep drinking.  I know I saw Larry with a few Long Islands and another screwdriver.  I drank a Long Island, a screw driver, a Jolly Rancher, and then was doing the dollar shots all night long.  I was having a blast...drunker then I've been in ages and loving every second of it.  I'm dancing away, made ammends with someone (this girl who is at the club every weekend thought I hated her, thing is...I thought she hated me.  Neither of us know why we each thought that, but we settled it all), and was just having the time of my life...when I started having a bad asthma attack.  I know that being around the cat at my mom's house brought it on (I'm extremely allergic to cats).  I couldn't breath, my chest was aching badly, my throat was tight, and to make it worse...I was drunk out of my mind which made me panic even more.  I realized I didn't have my inhaler, it was home.  I told Larry I HAD to go home...he was drunk and stupid and was like ""Sure, okay"".  Well, I went and sat in his Jeep for over 15 mintes...trying to catch my breath...and he was no where around.  While I'm out there, this guy who has been infatuated with me for as long as I can remember wanders out and starts talking to me.  Next thing I know, he is pushing himself towards me, lips puckered, attempting to KISSING ME!  I'm freaking out, already out of breath, trying to push this 250 pound guy the fuck away from me.  My friend Andy happens to be outside and sees this and comes running over, grabs the guy, and tells him ""Get the fuck off of her!"".   Thank God for him.  Andy asks me if I'm alright and I'm in tears telling him I need to get home to my inhaler.  He goes inside, comes back out dragging Larry behind him telling him he needs to take me home NOW.

I think everything is going to be okay when Larry first has to stop at the gas station.  Granted, it's two AM, but Elmira is one of those cities (especially on weekends) that is always busy.  The gas station was packed, just for him to get $5 in gas we took 15 minutes.  We leave the gas station, I'm still gasping for air and crying, and I'll be damned...he HAS to stop by his dope dealers house to buy a quarter.  I was so freaking pissed off...I refused to go in with him (going in involved walking up many stairs and I was out of breath as it is).  I must of waited another 15 minutes for him...I was furious.  THEN, he tells me we're stopping by one of his friends houses because he doesn't believe I'm having trouble breathing, he says I'm just drunk and over re-acting.  That's when I just snapped.  I was screaming at him.  I was like ""I can NOT fucking breath, you are taking me home, I'm using MY inhaler, and I'm going to bed in MY bed"".  With that said, he drove me home.  I slammed the door to his car and made sure to flip him off on my way in the house.  Inconsiderate bastard.  I hope to God he never has an asthma attack and goes through what I went through last night.  It was torture, and it was worse that he just kept refusing to drive me home to my inhaler.

Anyways, happier things.  Went looking for a car today and ended up finding one.  It's so hot.  Okay, it's an almost brand new Chevy Cavalier Z24 and the thing is-I've never really been into those...but you have to see it.  The person who owned it before me did lots of body work on it, and it's PIMPED out.  It's two door, sunroof, cd player, spoiler, those small hot tires (can't think of what they are called, the gray/white tinted windows...it's HOT.  I ended up putting a deposit down on it today, I'm taking it to the garage Monday to get it inspected (the guy who owns it said if ANYTHING at all is wrong with it, he will pay to have it fixed before I buy it off him), and then I should have it by the end of next week.  I'm so freaking excited...I know it's a car thats going to draw alot of attention."

The thing is, he promised he'd go to Elmira with me tonight at 11 to pick someone up because I didn't wanna drive alone (it's only 15 min...but still, I'm very tired and feel out of it today for some reason).  Well, we get back to my house and he is like ""Is it okay if I go home and you call me to come back in a couple hours?!"".  FUCK NO it's not okay.  Why you ask?!  Because I know Larry very well.

Everything for the bathroom has an angel/cherub theme...they are beautiful (I love angels).  I also bought some other odds and ends I'll be needing...I bought some glasses for the kitchen that I HAD to have (palm trees, bright pinks and oranges for summer), measuring cups, and such.

I dropped all my stuff off at my mom's, shes letting me store it all in the basement until I get an apartment.  I told her that I realized today I'll also need a second tv, along with a microwave, and other pricey things.  She suggested putting thigns on lay away and making payments...not a bad idea, should of thought about it sooner.  Guess my next trip to Walmart is gonna be all lay away.

"event","Oooohhh what a day.  Worked most of it, ended up making good money though because we were really busy.  Can you believe, that in just two and a half hours, I made over $80 in tips?!  Yeah.  That's how busy it was.  I got out of work and was so tired I just wanted to drop.

I've decided I'm ready to move out now.  It's not that living at home is horrible or anything (I don't have rules or a curfew...haven't in years, I come and go and do as I please) it's just that I am ready to be on my own.  I talked with Sara alot about it last night because she's lived alone for over a year.  She makes $200 less then I do a week, and she's doing okay...that's how I know it'll be possible for me to do this.  And I'm not gonna move right out just yet, I'm gonna wait a couple of months so I can save up some extra money.  In the mean time, I'm making a list of everything I'll need for my own apartment and I'm going to start buying things.  Sara wants to move out of New York eventually and we were talking about that tonight too.  I would love to get outta here as well, but I told her first...I need to prove, to myself, that I can live on my own.  Once I prove that, if she wants to take off-I'm all for it. 

Sara also confessed to me today that she cheated on her boyfriend last night.  Usually, I don't condone that...but in this case, I thought it was a good thing.  I don't like the boyfriend Sara has now.  He trys to ""change"" her all the time.  He wants her to ALWAYS dress up, he says people look sloppy in jeans.  He told her she can't spend her money on fast food.  A whole bunch of other stupid shit.  I'd never take that from a guy.  I'm trying to talk her into getting rid of him completely, I think I was getting somewhere tonight.

My birthday is coming up in less then a month.  I can't freaking wait.  I'm not sure if I wanna go bar hopping, have a bon fire, or do a combination of the two...but I know I'm inviting lots of people to come along.  It'll be a fun night.  And even better, my brother turns 21 in June....I already told him his big sister is gonna take him out that night and show him what a 21st birthday is all about.

Aight, I'm out for now."

"event","Agh.  Why did my mom have to call me so early and wake me up?!  I was in a nice, deep, Nyquil sleep and the phone just kept ringing and ringing....

I don't really have any plans for today.  Kraig mentioned something about going to get some job applications today.  If he goes, I'll probably go along (mainly because he'll let me drive his new Mustang, hee hee).  Other then that, I'm not sure what I'll find to do to amuse myself.  I may just spend most of the day around the house relaxing.  I haven't done that in awhile, I've been either working or running around with friends for the past few weeks.  Only time I've really been home is to sleep.  

Easter was okay, nothing to exciting.  Had dinner at my mom's boyfriends house.  We had ham, deviled eggs, potatos, garlic shells, corn on the cob, and cookies and cupcakes.  Stephanie noticed my nose ring for the first time and couldn't belive I've had it since Ocotber when I told her.  I find it amusing how so many of my friends (who see me often) took months to notice it.

Eh...maybe I'll have more to say later, so until then..."

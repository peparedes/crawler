"event","sometimes you can cry until there is nothing wet left in you
              you can scream and curse to where you throat rebels and ruptures
                      you can pray all you want, to whatever god you think will listen
          and still, it makes no difference.
                      it goes on with no sign as to when it might release you.
 and you know that if it ever did relent.......
         it wouldnt be because it cared

my thoughts exactly.im sorry if offend anyone w/ this post and i dont mean to if i do:i beleieve there is no god. i have believed this for the longest time, but when i bring it up i instantly get called down for it. and it doesnt help that for the last 10 years of my life i've had teachers ,pastors, parents, siblings, friend, ect. shoven this christain bull shit down my throat. i dont call the ""belivers"" dumb, blind, or ignorant, because i respect their opinons , and if some one questions me on my anti-faith, i'll happily tell them my opinions just as long as the dont call me dumb blind or ignorant! if this ""god"" is going to ""appear"" to me it probably wont matter if i study theolagy for years and always go to mas. you preatchers wont make ""him"" come any faster so leave me the fuck alone.im not trying to be a bitch and i dont make me not believing in god a big deal in my life so if any of yall wanted to get to know me but now dont ,that makes you a pretty big fuckin asshole bitch and or bastard. i am alot of fun so dont shun me for my belief and i wont shun you for yours

ps. to day i crack my neck and nuckle and a pleasure chill ran down my back. is this what i get off on?the beautifully repolsive so sound of ligiments being torn, boens breaking and flesh splitting?if so, next time i want an orgassim,ill head to the grave yard.noone there will mind if i snap their bones in half for my own lustful pleasure,then again it would be nice to hear a guys voicemoaning with pain screaming for me to stop. god ,im one sick little fuck"

"event","best song in the world: wait and bleed(slipknot)

i felt the hate rise up in me 
kneel down and clear a stone of leaves
i wonder around where you see 
inside myshell and wait and bleed

worst song in the world:recycled air(the postal service)

i watched the patchwork farms'
slow fade into the oceans arms
and from here they cant see me stare 
the stale taste of recycled air


happy early b-day to my sis, even though it is tomarrow.so wu up wit yall? i havent written in a while cause of events like tony's b-day on the 19th and concerts and holidays and other shit that gives me an excuse. my turkey day was cool, but afterward was bad. my cuz and logan were hell bent on gettin ""da reefer "" or as yall may call it ""da good shit"". they were being such heros(heroes r bad 4 those who dont kno)i luv logan(like a bro) and all but i want all that shit to stop. fuck drugs!(minus heroine)ohhhh! and other thing!fat ass Will is threating to have me arrested for harrassin him at work!!!me and becky!!!!(for those who dont kno,my boyfriend tony was kicked out of his house by Will,tony slept on the street for three days because of it, and Will kicked him out for NO REASON!,but all is good cause now tony is living w his parents again.YAY!will is like 670000lbs. no lie and he looks a pig, no lie!!! he will never get a girl he is crazy none likes him!!he is such a cock sucking bastard hes full of shit,literally!)so yea that fucker needs to die and i wouldnt mind putting a bullet into his brain.i wanna skin his neck, slowly tear out the veins,tie it around his opened ,fleshless neck, and hang him from a crucifix.im sorry for my vulgar display.my hate rises up in me when i think of certain people.one person who will remain nameless made me overflow in hate and has me obssessed with drawing vulgar pictures of dead crucified jews with spikes through their feet,wrists and neck( spikes through the neck arent commonly shown on a crucified person but i had to throw my tase in there a little)and pentagrams carvedinto their faces. im sorry if all this disturbs anyone but im really a nice person, the things i draw are alot different from the things i do. im only in a homicidal set of mind when i do certain things which cant be disclosed at the momentjust kidding! viva la squee!adios"

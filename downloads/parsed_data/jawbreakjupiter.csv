"event","The people promised that if the rocks let them use some of them, the people would wed the rocks with the sod in wonderful arrangements and structures. (Which came to being, the most fantastic structures ever.) Now the rocks had to be moved, and all the people helped and were paid by their weight. Though, that was unfair to the little people, so they worked on other things in dark corners. Soon came time that the little people were ready to unveil their creations. Great machines were made with magnificent spinning wings. They made lots of noise in front of big crowds. I was there. The little people demonstrated their machines to the amazement of many. The metallic winged beasts flew about the clouds and at night, colorful lights emitted from them. It was at night, when something went wrong. In front of the big crowd, the machine came back down at terrible speeds and then landed funny, and crashed and slid and turned over into the crowd. Its wings were spinning so violently, I was the first to do something. I stepped on its wings. Then more people followed and soon many many people were standing on its wings. We pleaded with the creators of these beasts to make them stop. They said it was easy, and came over to flip the switch. But the beast did not want to stop. It's body started spinning so fast that we were afraid to be near it. So, we fled. The people had not control over the metallic beasts that roamed the skies and went to the smartest man in the world for help. He was, at the time, building something he called a farviewing lens. (The farviewing lens was two very large lenses suspended high above ground and when aligned to look into the sky, the vast reaches of space could be seen.)"

"event","I allow myself to fall into some sort of desperate love, or a thing like love, that is sickeningly romantic. Its funny how romantic doesn't even run parallel with practical or realistic even. Its on a different plane or in a black hole or something. I am a sucker for all things romantic. I would run out and buy a horse, and a gun, and a holster for that fantastic gun, and ride around in the fucking desert, all fucking romantic-like, if it was at all practical."

"event","I wake up from a dream that's a dream that's a dream. Now I'm confused but not really caring. A little world inside my own construction, I am in control<sub><b>not really at all </sub></b>. I close my eyes and the play begins. It ends with a headache, heartache and a general all-around nausea. When the feverish tingling subsides, <sub><b>I can feel it when I scratch my legs</sub></b> I get up and lay back down. Pillows have their own gravity. So another play, eerily similar to the real thing <sub><b>a parallel universe perhaps?</sub></b>. Alarm clocks and Monday morning suns have no chance. They try so hard. The pillow wins again. My feet tap and twitch to the latest installment that's permeated my brain <sub><b>Franz Ferdinand</sub></b>. All that moves are my feet and my eyes under closed lids, searching, looking, and seeing."

I am never truly happy. It seems to me to be some extreme that can only exist in the rarest of peaks. I am too mellow of a person to procure said peaks, or extremes. I suppose I did as a child. In the beginning, everything is black and white and then it all fades and dulls into the dark grays and the light grays and the gray grays.

She hides her age from me. Although, I could really care less. It amazes still that these ""grown"" people can act so ""juvenile."" I discern her age and she makes a face... <i>now he knows!</i> I have much in common with her past boyfriends. Blah blah blah. I am not leading her on in the least. Unless being nice is giving a little, then I am always guilty."

"event","I can't help but to admit that I dig his style. His suspenders wear off to the side around his big belly and the velcro shoes are a nice touch. He coughs one of his lungs out as he reaches for his cigarettes. He closes his eyes and keeps them closed and takes long drags. As his eyes remain closed, smoke rolls out of his nostrils and the wind rushes it to my bench. It takes him about a minute to finish his cigarette and he gets up and walks away.

I am stopped in some little town close to Chicago. I didn't feel like sitting in the biggest traffic jam of all-fucking-time. If not of all time, then pretty fucking close to it. I told Jeff I would be back to take him to work. Its his first day. It is now two hours <i>after</i> he is supposed to be there. I was sweating my goddamned life force into my seat, my very being seeping into the upholstery. I had to stop.

I have a little less than two-hundred bucks in my pocket and I am wanting to keep driving past Chicago and on to Portland. The money is for the deposit on my apartment. I've been in a ""fuck it"" mood this past... well, <i>ever</i>.

So whats in Portland? I dunno. A seventeen-year-old-girl-that-shouldn't-have-me-driving-over-the-country-after. Stupid. I'm so stupid and hopeless, but I wonder if she can fill that hole. Plus, anyway, I love the drive. Nothing can be arsed while I'm going at an average of seventy-five miles per hour. I'm just going.

And going."

"event","As I thought about the horrible shame of the capability of this machine, that horrible shame occurred. I turned my car around to see if the cat was alright. Its brains were coming out the top of its head and the twitching of its leg waned. I can't do a goddamn thing and it makes me sick. I just hope that one day I am mangled by a car."

"event","They are practically strangers to me. There is a peace that emits from them though. A peace emits from us. We are strangely like a family. I can't recall ever eating three meals in a day with the same three people. We got up in the morning and Beth made breakfast. Around one, Amy made lunch. Then again, Amy made a meal for dinner. We drink chardonnay because it is summer. We walk freely in and out of each others apartments and practically in our underwear, I might add, because it is so damned hot and terribly humid. No one minds. Why should they?"

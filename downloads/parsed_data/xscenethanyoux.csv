"event","I feel sad. Why does everyone ditch me?? Seriously. Is it because I'm a loser that everyone hates. I mean I think all my friends pretend to be my friends and just attack me secretly. I remember just after school when I was gonna go to a Cremmen's house. I was ditched and Scott, Justin, Cremmen just left me. Damnit, I'm just so mad and angry. I feel so lonely. Will someone just like me, not pretend to. I mean everyone pretends to be my friend. No one is real to me. Is it true or I'm just too negative. I mean I feel this way because of everyone around me makes me so uncomfortable. I mean people accuse me of something I do and one time in Gym kids named Ben Sanderson, Boris Mateev, Jeff Curley, and some other kids accused me of losing the race for them. Well it wasn't completely my fault cause the other team cheated and was in the first lane and Andy was off the track. Still, they blame all their troubles on me. WHY AM I TO BLAME ABOUT THINGS I DON'T DO!!! IT MAKES ME SO UNHAPPY!!! I don't think people have been able to see my extremely sensitive side. Only cause I'm afraid to cry in public. I'm only better just crying alone here in my room. I don't see why everyone's accusing me of everything. Artie Wilson makes me blue a lot. He says that no one cares about me, and I seriously take it personally. He doesn't know because he has no heart to realize that I have a big heart that takes thing too personally. People say I take thing harder than I should. I honestly think I am taking things softer than I should. In gym, Eric, Ben, Boris, and some other kids(I forgot their names but if I do remember 'em, I'll list them here) accused me of doing something weird in the locker room that I did not do. That didn't make me feel that good.  Ian Fraser-Corp is such a dick and a pimp wannabe. He attacks me a lot and stalks me. Ben Sanderson just punches me when I sometimes, go a little crazy. Jake Sumner pisses me off saying he's emo. He calls me a poseur. Which I'm not. I'm not emo either. No one is truly emo. No one. You can't be emo. You can like emo, but that doesn't mean you are emo. Labels are lame and should die. I sometimes call myself ""emo"" as a joke to confuse all you people and say all these overexaggerating things just to confuse people about things. Then, there's Ben Becker. The complete asshole who always grabs me, scares me, and tries to beat me up. I'm even surprised he even has at least one friend."

"event","Went to Newbury Comics, Urban Outfitters, thrift store, and some shoe stores in Cambridge. It was pretty cool. I had dinner there with my dad at the Bertucci's there too. I bought a bunch of stuff from Newbury Comics like The Appleseed Cast's old album, Mare Vitalis(Latin for sea life if you don't know Latin), and Saves the Day's Stay What You Are. I have both on bootleg, but it just doesn't feel the same having a real copy. I only get bootlegs when I'm poor, but I'm not. I even got a new belt with holes in em. I think they're gromett belts, whatever you call them. I even got new Cons that will just replace my worn out, ripped, and small Chucks. I remember it was pretty windy outside and all I had was my Brand New t-shirt and I felt a little chilly. My dad offered his jacket but, his jacket's pretty weird and embaressing for some reason. I always laugh at my dad when he wears it. It just looks funny on him for some reason. BTW, I feel a little sick, it's spring and that means allergy season. I hate it. I had like really horrible watery eyes the other day and they were scary. I also have a runny nose that's being a bitch. There's also a cough which means asthma has came back to me. My vacation's almost over. Oh boy, it's time to go back to school."

I remember like asking everyone what their AIM screen names are. It was awesome seeing Faraway, Therefore I Am, Ambry, and A Loss for Words. The lead singer of Faraway was so nice to me that he gave me their band demo and stickers for free. I even got to like high five the lead singer for ALFW during their set after some guy shouted out saying that they suck but was I was like, you don't suck. They did such a good Boys to Men cover. Therefore I am was awesome. It was the bassist birthday and he sure had a good one. But, it wasn't really his birthday ya know, it's just a tradition, that Jim has a birthday everyday. He gave me a hug when he was talking about me how I'm cool and stuff. Next week, I'm gonna go to another show. It's gonna be longer since there are more bands. It's in Roller Kingdom. I can't wait.

"event","Yea, another posting. I just talked to some girl online who I used to like. She says that she hates me more than I hate her. Well, we just had a talk about how she says that I'm heartless that I hired so many people to like annoy her, piss her off, and say rumors(that she thinks they are but I don't think they are). We all can be heartless at times. I'm just very guilty right now. I mean I did do mean stuff but a lot of people I know would've done the same thing to her if that happened. Well if you're reading this whoever I felt heartless towards, well I'm very sorry. I don't think you'd read it because I blocked you but still, just in case if you do I'm sorry. But I still hate you regardless if I'm sorry. And I'm sorry with all my heart. Ok. Well I feel like a messenger boy having to tell Al things from Hannah. It's very interesting. I mean Hannah still wants him but Al is already with Mirella who I hear basically broke up Hannah and Al. I hope they go back together, they seem like a pretty good couple. Anyways, I had a good time yesterday, just taking pictures of Steve, Ben, Alex, and Joey skating. It was fun, just taking pictures. Except this ass named Kyle started like punching me in the stomach and just trying to beat me up. What a dick. Well, it's like everything is like a rumor about me. Like I hear people who I never told I was going to take pictures of Alex skating asking me, Vini, are you gonna take pictures of Alex skating? People are saying, ""Why are you taking pictures of Alex?"" Some kids think I wanna shoot for Playboy when I'm older, lol. It's just weird. I want to be a photograher and some day take pictures of rock magazines or maybe like nature. Well I can't wait to show em on Monday to one of the skater's gf's. I promised tomorrow but I didn't realize that my dad didn't get em developed at CVS. Oh well. Sorry Stephanie, just wait Monday."

"event","Hey, it's me again. Anyway, I'm just recently listening to this really good band. They're called The Blood Brothers and they are really good. They are so much better than rap or rnb combined. Everyone's like it isn't but they haven't heard it. Everyone thinks they're right about everything. I don't really think I'm right because I just think the Blood Brothers are better than a lot of stuff. Just listen to their old stuff like ""March On Electric Children"" or ""Burn Piano Island, Burn"" and you'll see it's better than Usher or anything you've ever heard. ""Crimes"" their new album's alright, it's a change from their old stuff but it's all good. I can't catagorize this band. It's pretty tough, ppl think they're screamo or hardcore. It's just hard. Well anyway, either way its good shit.

I like long hair and my hair was short before but they had to just mutilate it to a shitty haircut that I had once which I hated soo much. So evil. Plus I want it to cover my entire fricking forehead. I'm not happy with it. That's why i even cut my own hair, to prevent it from being mutilated. Damn, it sucks. It seriously sucks major shit.

I have no friends. Plus, what is the point of having friends. I mean you can go life without friends. There's still family. Maybe people think I worry too much for a 13. But still, I think it's not too young since I'm not in Elementary School anymore. I just don't know. I doubt that anyone truly likes me. Plus people laugh at me when I do stupid things. I try to stop because I think people think im just a stupid weirdo. No one understands me!!! I hate having Asperger's Syndrome. It sucks, having a syndrome that screws up your social skills. I feel so misunderstood. What the hell is even the point of having friends when your misunderstood by every single person on the planet????!!!!!! People say I need to cheer up but I can't. I mean I'm so alienated by people. I think the popular girls pretend to like me because they feel bad for me. Plus, I'm not as cool as some ppl think I am. I think I'm just too overrated as a person. Is it even that important to have friends? I mean I have a family who can support me. But my parents can scare me a little. I don't know. I mean I can be mean, a snob, etc. but I don't mean to do it. Seriously, it just comes naturally. Some people think I need a good hug from someone. I don't think anyone would wanna give a good hug to me. Anyway, last year, I felt so sad for like weeks just crying at night about that I won't get any friends in Jr. High, I think I could've but I doubt that I even got some new friends.Well I have to go get some sleep.

Speaking of the whole nervous breakdown stuff, well, Shansi sure knows how to make people have nervous breakdowns. She IMed me saying that I have no friends, well really, all she said was that I don't have many friends that I have just nerdy friends. Also, that she said that everyone makes fun of me. True, but I have more friends than she thinks. I feel so badly for myself when she told me that. God, I was crying and crying. I needed something to comfort me. Am I lonely? Or do I just worry too much. I think I'm just too worrysome. Not thinking that there are people around me who care. Last year, I felt like that too. I remember the whole thing about signing t shirts, I refused to sign anyone's t shirt and I refused anyone to sign mine cause well, I think that the number of signatures on my back show how many friends I have, I believed. 0, nada, nothing.

Well honestly, I'm just sorta lying cause I really want someone to annoy her, but I can't cause I think I suck at annoying ppl on purpose. I just can't really get over her, remember, I cried for like two days straight at night. She just denies it cause she doesn't know about that whole part. Well I'll just post some lyrics since I dont really have anything else to do, it's a lyric from a really good emo band that I'm listening to right now. 

Let me take this awkward saw
And run it against your thighs
Cut some flesh away
I'll carry this piece of you with me
Because all I can say tonight
is that I hate you
But it would be all right
If we could see each other sometime
If I could somehow make you mine
And if not I'll take my spoons
And dig out your blue eyes
I'll swallow them down to my colon
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
Cause you're beautiful
Just not on the inside
Light comes from within
Your beaming eyes don't seem so bright
Heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Boardwalks and breaking waves
Made our Saturdays
I'd buy you lemonade right now
if you were here
Then I'd throw it in your face
And I'd listen to you cry
I'd remember how I miss
our nights under ocean skies
You and I are like when fire
and the ocean floor collide."

I'm super scared cause she might shout at my at school. Well to make things worse, we were learning about bullying and teasing and sexual harrasment (in her homeroom since my homeroom's tv is screwed)so basically, it made me nervous about the whole rumor thing since she claimed that I was spread rumors that she made me cry. She really did make me cry. It was last year though around like May I think. She said to me ""Vini, do you wanna go out to the dance"" and I said ""um, yea."" The next thing she said was, ""Did you know that im just kidding?"" That really upset me. When I went home, I was in my room crying and crying in my bed. I was just crying myself to sleep. Ever since that day, I got super bitter and I even asked some friends of mine to annoy her on aim and piss her off. I really hate her and if she's reading this, well this is all true.

"event","It's soo early and I dont really have anything to do. I bought some new shoes at the mall and I got a new pc game. It was fun for a little while. It got boring. Now I'm listening to Cursive to just cure my boredom and tireness. I dunno, I just like being awake. Well anyway, I asked out some girl like a few days ago and she was like ""i dont need a bf now"". I'm guessing that's a no. I feel like the only one who hasn't dated. I feel lonely and I cry myself to sleep thinking about this. I mean, I might have a ""few friends"" but they don't cheer me up. I think I'll never have a gf or a bf(remember im bisexual). :'(. Well I g2g bye."

"event","It's snowing like hell today. I wish we had a snow day. Eh, anyway, some girl named Emily wanted me to go out with her. I dont! I just got imed saying that I should ask her out. I dont wanna ask her out. I wanna date Ellie not Emily. A friend of mine (Steven!!!) told me about the time he went out with Emiliy. He said that Emily's mom gave his mom like a bunch of papers with the phone and IM conversations. Steve was like WTF????!!!!. I don't want that to happen to me, plus Emily's not my type. Well I'm a little annoyed that she wants to go out with me. Oh yea, I forgot, when a bunch of ppl found out that im bi, Emily was asking me what guy would I wanna go out with if I had to, and I said, Alex Li and she told Anupa. I'm a little frustrated by Emily.

"event","Hi, this is Vini. I'm just some 13 year old living in a boring place. There is like no real good place to hang out. My parents tend to worry too much about shit. It's like that they like to organized stuff. I mean when a friend wants to come over, my mom's like NO, let's start a friggin schedule so he/she could come. No one really understands me. It's like that everyone at my school says that im cool just cause I stand out. Some mean assholes label me. I seriously hate labels, they're always like, you emo fag, emo sucks, why not u go cry in the corner emo boy. I wear my glasses just cause I like wearing em and it makes me look better. Eh, I got to go. Bye."

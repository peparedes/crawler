Once, from a Rabbi named David at this morning's Side Project to Startup sessions, 'to make white, as if to kill from embarassment'.

Second, having dinner with part of the family at Morton's The Steakhouse. Politics and my drunk family. I was driving, thus, I was not drunk. In short, it was easy to be mortified."

I have four columns of things to do, one each for each of the projects at work, one for all of tech things that should happen, and one column of things to do, just in general.

If I get one thing done from each column every day, I consider myself doing alright. 

Yes, I might be a kindof a stressed out lady. But really, really.. I can handle it. Adulthood isn't as hard when you can write it all down and break it into smaller pieces.

Love life is complicated, only because I'm not upset about it.  I got a lecture from a friend today that I should be more upset about it. I don't necessarily mind. Where's the problem with it? I do what I want, he does what he wants, and only when his doing what he wants impacts my doing what I want - that's the problem. We've, uh, come perilously close to that point of impact. He's out of town right now, with no contact on my part. So we'll see what happens. I'm not all that concerned about it because I have other things on my plate to keep me busy. And that something better is coming, he just might not be here. No problem there.

Work is kicking up. I'm being shanghai'd into showing what I'm good for. It's about time, but it's kindof a bad time. Ah well. It's all about priorities, and right now, that's a fine thing to be priority 2. 
I'm also going to work on getting some Linux Engineering certifications out of the way, so that I really know what I'm doing. That would be great to focus on, except, again, other things are holding my attentions. 

As of this afternoon and starting Wednesday, I'm going to be holding two apartments until the end of May. I also have a cat named Tess. She's sweet, she's going back to her person July 1st. As of yesterday, it looks like I'm going to be singing with a jazz trio in a wine bar downtown this summer, if I get my act together.
Just being well rounded. 

Dinner tonight for myself (and maybe K, if I can get her down here) is going to be lemongrass beef and noodle salad. Sliced steak marinated in a lemongrass-nam pla mixture, seared and served with chilis, cucumbers and fresh cilantro over cellophane noodles. Should be delicious. At this rate, I'm probably not going to eat before 11. Ah well.

I've finally found myself a Wii this weekend, and it's been pretty exciting. I actually haven't used it that much, simply because I'm a little afraid that I'll get sucked in and won't come out of it for awhile. It's kindof an irrational fear, I can only think of a few times that's happened, but it scares me a bit. However, over the course of time, it's a pretty cheap form of therapy.
  Add in time at the Y without using my MP3 player... which I did today. I didn't realize how unproductive my workouts were with music, simply because I tend to focus on the music and not about getting better, either mentally or physically. I went and erged for awhile and tried to think about what I wanted out of life, watched it snow outside and looked at the houses across the street. Much nicer than looking out into the dark, and I'm realizing that I'm cheating myself out of some really nice experiences, doing the work to get better. Mentally, physically, personally and professionally. 
Just do it. Just do the work. Only good things can come.

First I tried her on the phone card, and it rang. And she didn't pick up. So then I called her back, hoping that I had the right number.
Then I got on Skype and sent her a text message. And then, for good measure, I sent her another text message. She finally texted me back and said, way to go, I was in class.

On a completely different note, I am surprised at where my thoughts go when I'm wearing certain perfumes.

Being patient is really really hard for me, because I am very assertive and aggressive and I constantly struggle with the fact that I was not born male. 

But -dammit-. When I want things, I tend to want them now, or to know that I can be actively working towards something and digging my heels in as best I can. I want to be able to just keep swimming and know that everything's going to be ok. 

And so when the best thing to do is clearly back off and let someone else make their moves without being hindered by mine, this is ridiculously difficult for me. I get really frustrated with it, but I have to admit that I held a line for longer than I've been able to hold a line before. Nearly a week, but Halloween hit me tonight as a quasi-mostly holiday, but even though I tried to change things, I didn't meet with anything different. In short, the new boy isn't working out nearly as well as I would like this very second. It's difficult to be emotionally available when you're working 14 hours days all week long and have other plans for the weekend. 

I am noticing that this frustration is starting to move around in my life. It's not as productive as if I had an overabundance of guilt, it's only about half as productive, because I can sit down and watch my frustration beat itself against the bars of the cage. I am starting to wonder what the happiness here is coming from. Is it me telling myself that you should really be happy here, because it will be so much easier? Or am I really truly happy here? It's something that creeps along in the 3am darkness. 

NoNaWriMo is on us. I'm looking at the mirror of self-reflection and am curious as to whether or not I want to try this year. It probably won't hurt to start it, and see how far I get. My WriMo last year was my thesis, and that was fairly hellish. And yet, I could probably sustain that kind of activity again. Kill myself off for a month and see if I can't endure it, see how much more I could be getting. You can get what you want, or you can just get old. 
 Dammit, I still want the choice, or at the very least, the chance. We shall see. We will try to try 'easier' in this, and harder in everything else."

At least everything's the same way as you left it this morning. Perfect? Hardly. But copeable, and I haven't budged yet. Part of it is because I can't. (If I could cave, would I? Absolutely. November. November. November. Not until November. Maybe I feel differently in November. Maybe not.)

Maybe it's the fact that it's gray and cold, and the heat in my apartment hasn't come on so it's just sortof... almost warm in here, but today's just awfully depressing. I keep thinking about breaking my rules and seeing what will happen, but no good can come of it. 
 I want to call him, invite him out here and see if I can't make it work. 
I haven't, and I won't, and if I still feel the same way next Sunday, the 6th or the 7th or the 8th of October, then I'll reevaluate then and see why I feel that way. 
  Um. I think it's long showertime and curl up in bed with a movie or a book because everyfucking other thing is fucking closed. 

  On the other hand, I think my life is going to become considerably more complicated by this time next week. More to come on that."

  Not that I'm content to have my career be the only thing in my life, but you build from there. I'm finally in a place where I can make my own little nest exactly how I want it, and that's helpful too. 
  I'm attempting to distinguish what it is that will make this place 'home' to me. Maybe it's coming over the crest of the hill and seeing the lights laid out in the valley, with the red dots on the surrounding hills that mark the windmills. Maybe it's the Marcus Whitman rising over the highway as I pull over the overpass and get off. Last night, it was rolling down the windows and getting a cold blast of fall air while coasting down the treelined streets to my apartment. 
 Part of me is telling me that if I make this 'home', I will be ever so much happier. And here, I am happy. Maybe not completely, but I'm safe here. 
  Right now, that's the most important thing."

It was built in 1922, just as the deco took over, but I'm more into nouveau, so I expect that I'm going to need at least one chandelier and three stained glass things around. 

In other news, my memory foam bed arrived today. It lives in my living room for the moment, when I figure out a bedframe for it, it'll go into the bedroom. Choices, choices.
  I am so happy to have these choices though, honestly. My apartment. All mine."

"event","He called. Ack! I got really emotional and then my mommy called, which was exactly what I needed. 
 I realize that I really can't talk to him because I end up as his shrink, and I'm way too involved. 
Until then, it was like.. 8, 9 days? I really can't remember how long, but it was good and it felt good and now I can continue like I'm doing. 
  I need to put up something on my refrigerator -- 'Do you really need to have this conversation? Is it going to close the deal any faster? Can you actually deal with this aftershock right now?'
  And if it's not something I can deal with, then I simply have to walk out into the hallway.. because that's a surefire way to break the signal on my cell phone. Brilliant. 
  Tomorrow my new life starts! WHEE!!!
 
I've been riding my bike every morning around the neighborhoods of Walla Walla, and it's been beautiful. Everyone says good morning, and I feel like Belle in Beauty and the Beast. There -might- be more than this provincial life, but you know what? I'm good with it. 
  Little town, it is a quiet village. But I'm sure that there's lots of tension in places, you can see it in the  changes in the blocks. There are lovely tree-lined streets with huge craftsman homes.. and two blocks away it can be hot, dry and dusty with ramshackle cottages and broken down yards.
  If the mortgage collapse really -is- going to hit all over the economy, this is going to be a very interesting place to watch.  My grandmother has been saying for two years that the second Great Depression is coming, and my mother and I had a conversation about that. Grandmother would say to try and attach myself to a farm, because you can grow your own food. I don't think I need to do that yet, but I think that I'm going to see what I can do to make a go of it. I guess I really just have an incredible faith that everything's going to work out the way it's supposed to. 

And apparently, I had forgotten this, but my mother proposed to my father over a plate of pork and beans at a cafe... by saying that she wasn't going to move to California unless he married her.. His response, ""Well, ok, if that's the way it's gonna be, that's ok."" 
  The world's an alright place. It's 80 degrees in my apartment and sunny outside. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing, and I'll be here."

You really have to love the grey market, because it's possible to get a memory foam mattress for less than $200... when you were prepared to pay that much for the lowest end mattress in the furniture stores.
 Yes, I realize that if everyone lived like me, no one would ever make any money.. but what do you -expect-. I'm a consultant, and ideally a very resourceful one at that. 
 
 Tomorrow's the last day before I go in for work for real. Which is good, because summer is nice, but fall is coming, and (yes, <i>Winter is coming</i> after that)... and it means that it's time to go back in.
  I wonder where I'll be at this time next year. 

It hit me the other day that isn't going to be nearly as hard as Italy. Italy was just murderously difficult, because I didn't have any of my people around me, and I got a really good look at the other side of the world, literally and figuratively. Italy the place is great. Italy as an experience can be very trying, but the person that I am now would go back. The person who lived through that was -never- so happy to get on a plane back to the US, but we did it, and we pulled through and we learn to live with ourselves. I never once thought that it was a mistake to be there, though, and I never once considered pulling out, even though it was really tough going when I was that isolated. 
  Perhaps I should learn how to quit things. Some other time. 
  Back to small town living tonight, though."

<i>Slow down, you crazy child
You so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart, 
then tell me why are you still so afraid?

Where's the fire?
What's the hurry about?
you better cool it off before you burn it out
you got so much to do and only so many hours in a day

but you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want
or you can just get old
you're going to kick off 
before you even get halfway through

when will you realize
Vienna waits for you

Slow down, you're doing fine, 
you can't be everything you want to be before your time
although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight... tonight..
Too bad but it's the life you lead 
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Although you can see when you're wrong, you can't always see when you're right
You're right

You've got your passion
You've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true..

When will you realize -- Vienna waits for you. 

Slow down you crazy child 
Take the phone off the hook
And disappear for a while
It's all alright
You can afford to lose a day or two

When will you realize..
Vienna waits for you.

but you know that when the truth is told
that you can get what you want
or you can just get old
you're going to kick off 
before you even get halfway through

Why don't you realize
Vienna waits for you.

I think I learned what time off looks like this summer, but I didn't disappear. Actually, I did a really bad job of actually relaxing this summer, but I'm going to blame that on how touchy everything else has been. But it's the first of September, a new year in a new apartment with a new situation. 
I'm still cleaning, but I've been able to attack the kitchen and decide what stuff I'll use and what stuff I'll deepsix."

 I still haven't felt up to it to go and attack the kitchen, but I did find Vanilla! Coke! at Grocery Outlet, which I appreciate greatly. As well as a new shower curtain, which was desperately needed. The only things that I haven't gotten today were a new toilet seat (because, c'mon. -That's- important.), some fans for the apartment, but then there was a great thunderstorm and that took care of the hot-muggyness. I have put all of my clothes into the closet and the drawers, my bathroom looks to be in better shape than it was, but I should still  clean a bit more, and I'm going to rearrange my living room so that I could fit a futon in it.
 
 Did I mention before that I have a piano in my living room? I kid you all not. I have a Kroeger piano, which I love dearly, and I'm going to try and find my music that I had kicking around. I can tell that it's out of tune, it doesn't hum true when you silence it. 
I also have a guitar, and room for the harp if I convince Mom and Dad to send it to me.
  This is fantastic! If my kitchen wasn't the size of a closet, this would be perfect.
  
The bad thing -- the tile by the tub faucet is badly in need of repair. The maintenance guy is very nice, so I told him to deal with it when he came back from his vacation. Not his fault that Sr. Tweaky didn't pay any damn attention to what went on in the place and didn't let him know ahead of time. 

Things I want to do tonight -- 
  Install MT on the professional blog
  Replace the curtains in the mainroom, while watching Wedding crashers
  Rearrange the desk 
  Research home theater setups and price estimates for LCD display TV (+ futures markets)
  Discover the Labor Day deals in WW

  Pictures of the place are forthcoming. The best way that I can describe it is that I can imagine looking out at the rooftops of Paris in this place, except it's not -quite- that quirky. The kitchen would have to be different, because this kitchen is definitely a one-person galley.

I haven't decided what I'm going to call this house, other than the fact that it is my first place that I have more or less to myself. I have no roommates, and it's pretty much mine to do with as I'd like.

Today I woke up, packed everything up and put it in the car. And when I finally did walk out of the door, lock it behind me and tuck my key under the mat, it was a surreal feeling. If my life was a movie, that part would be entirely silent, and ""Free and Easy Down the Road I Go"" would come on as I start up the car, turn it around, and go down Taylor's Ferry, to 26th St, onto Barbur, loop onto the 5... and driving over the Marquam Bridge, I finally lost it. 
However, I couldn't tell you what I was feeling, or why I was crying, just from the surreality of it all. 
My back is too messed up right now to allow for more thoughts, so I'm off to the store to grab a) ice cream b) coke and c) beer, because it's ridiculously hot and humid here.
 Whee! 
  
 Enjoy the next part of the ride, folks. It can only get better from here. Except for the times when it's worse, but I really don't know when that is, do you?

"event","All over the world, people generally are nice and friendly. I'm momentarily having trouble with the fact that I am a girl getting into the business world and that carries some connotations. I can't negotiate (yet) as I'd like to, because I can't afford the reputation that brings for a woman. 
But as I get more into this, I have to remember what I have that tends to make chance encounters change my mind. E refers to it as my 'rose-colored aura'. 

<i>Other people -- ""Oh, A! We love A!"" 
E - ""Why? She's such a ditz sometimes!"" 
Other people -- ""Oh, yes, we know, but she's so cute!"" 
E -- ""Urgh. I can't believe this. Why don't I have a rose-colored aura?"" 
</i> 
Sunday night, I drove out to Hermiston-area to go see the meteor shower, and ended up having a midnight adventure on a Harley driving out on country roads. Might it have been a motorcycle date? Most probably, but I was pretty honest as to what my 'status' was, and it was good fun. I must never use this force for evil, the one that reminds me that people are genuinely nice if you can get them to open up. This force opens doors that you didn't see coming, where a chance meeting changes your mind about some things. 

Because of a plane flight, I'll remember the ocean in my daily life. It's still possible to be working on a career and still want to be able to save the world. You don't actually -have- to grow up, and you can still be called 'Your Honor'. 
Because of a ride on an escalator, I'll remember that despite the corporate world, there are niches and communities that feed off of the energy and excitement of the people who are in theme, even in the EvilEmpire. (Which I will refer to as the Great Land of M$oft, in the future.) 
Because of a late-night drive, I'll remember motorcycles as a great game to play, and another interesting community that I genuinely enjoy. Despite the fact that you've made a lot of money, you can still mess up your life in big ways. Divorces tend to take parts of your soul that you didn't even know you had, and while you might be worth a bajillion dollars, having someone to come home to is worth more than that. 

I'm not always straightforward here. This time, I will be."

"event","Sometimes when I listen to Manu Chao, I remember Peru. 
 It was the first time that I ever had boy troubles, and a month with them should have been traumatizing, but it was actually really thrilling. I wasn't particularly drawn to either of them, but they were both drawn to me. I don't know of any other way to explain it. 
They were cousins, one was 24 and had just spent the last 3 months traveling around South America, and the other one was my age, 18 and just about to go to college. Of course I ended up choosing the wild worldly one, the one who had nearly bottomed out in New York City and was about to go back to grad school, the one that wanted to smoke and drink and dance and had a strong dislike of religion. I think I acquired all of these things, except the smoking. I have since gotten rid of these tastes, just a little bit. 
 The one that wasn't interested in drinking, dancing and messing around Peru started writing poems about angels with long red hair..  
And I was mortified at the time, and now I think it's really really funny. 
And now I've just spent an hour and a half on AIM catching up. 

In other news, I miss my associate, but he's getting better online."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Headshake!"">After an exciting week, I just had the weirdest conversation with my associate. I am suddenly extremely glad that I'm so independent, because otherwise this would be really difficult.
It's been really difficult in the past, and this time I more or less told myself that it was not going to be like that. 
 And like B. said, the best revenge is living well. And I intend to do that. 
Yes, the possibilities would be fun, but right now, I need some me-and-career time. College was fun. Careers take a bit more effort. 

I'm sure I've said this once or twice before. We're either doing just fine or we're going to get divorced. (Amicably, though.) I really can't tell. I'm also not sure if my feelings have anything to do with it. In the meantime, I'm enjoying my jazz and my car and my freedoms... </lj-cut>
Or why I'm not in Alaska this summer. Urgh. That would drive me batshit. 
Facebook's 'complicated answer' says it all. 

In other news, I have a calltime set up for Wednesday to discuss a job-related decision with a company. Which I am trying not to hope too hard for, but I'll keep the home fires burning wherever I go. 

I'm going to keep baking, and keep working on paring my stuff down to fitting into LittleCar (that I love dearly) and then can drive around to my new life."

"event","Most of you already know that I'm a media junky. If it's in the papers, I'll probably read it, and I read the New York Times everyday. As far as online coverage will get me.
But today was a particularly good article on the letters of Hillary Rodham from her college years... and I loved them. I was a history major because I wanted to hear people's stories, and these small fragments from her past make the difference between a candidate that I could actually support and a candidate that I'm interested in. 
  More to come on this point. 
My computer is making these ghostly wails at me, and I don't think it's iTunes. That brings up an intriguing point. Is it possible to have a haunted computer, different from an infected computer? 

Ah no, it's the new CD I have in iTunes. Maybe that's what I'll do today. Fix iTunes to my liking."

"event","I'm having a moment here, of total panic. 
I'm cute, funny and have lots of stuff going on, not the least of which was working Ubuntu Live over the past couple days. However, I'm guessing that I'm freaking out because I need to put together a better tech resume than I've got, and it's just a matter of getting my shit together. 
 When you only have a certain amount of choices, your life seems simple, and when the curtain is drawn back, it reveals something else entirely. 
Ubuntu Live was fantastically useful. Do I care about Ubuntu now? Without a doubt. Open source software is a bit like the shining light, but I'm torn about what else lives behind the curtain.
    Who am I, really?

(Yes, getting asked for a tech resume -does- feel like the apocalypse. I'm just going to have to sit down and make a list of things that I know I can do, and then add to that as more stuff comes up. Fark.)"

"event","Because everything was rolling around in my head, and I realized that I wasn't done with today yet. 
  I'm taking a deep breath here, because I think I'm on the verge of making a massive misstep. Rationally, I know that can't possibly be, because it's going to work out fine, connecting with people is never as hard as I make it out to be. Still though. 
  
  The taste in my mouth is exactly the same as it was just before I came to school. And that worked out fine, but I've got the same sort of wild energy that's ratcheting in my head. 
  Not all places are created equal. Not all jobs are going to be who I am. WA would be a safe place. 
It might also have the potential to be boring as hell. But it seems more grown up than haring off all over the world. 
  I remember this other person in my life, the person that was tired of the travel and the people who are too busy to talk and visit and even -listen-, the city traffic and the noise, the one who's found somewhere cozy, and comfortable .... where do I put her? What do I do with her when I've spent the past 3 years cultivating her? I hate being up at 3am, in the darkness, with the computer screen for company... but that's exactly the place I am. 
 
  When the genie comes out of the lamp that last time, saying.. Al, you're never gonna find another girl like her, not in a million years. Believe me, I know, I've looked... What exactly was Aladdin leaving behind? 
  Tonight, three hours ago, as I was lying in bed, I got a glimpse of the future. In one, I'm living in a community stripping my front porch of paint, with purple coneflowers growing in the front. It's a blue house, and I'm getting rid of the yellowing white strips in the front, and it'll be a bright white again. But in another, my days are wild and I'm in a black skirt suit and heels, making deals all over the world and I've been to Tokyo three times.... 

 And I'm crying now because I'm not sure if there's someone else's shadow in the background. I stopped and I looked, and in the house, there are pictures, but there's dust motes in the air and I can't make out if they're recent or not. 
I can't tell who the last 10 phone calls are on the other girl's iPhone.. they're probably all business anyways. And Dad. 

Are they happy? Yes, absolutely, I'm certain of that .... but I don't want to wait to find out where the shadow goes. Oh love."

I am not using this particular journal at all these days. Nope, not at all ... not for any random updates nor for the moderating of any of my communities. Though this username is still listed as the maintainer of the communities that I created and will continue to remain listed as the maintainer, in future I will not be the person you will need to go to for any questions regarding any of those communities. I will be appointing a new co-maintainer very soon, but in the meantime, should you have any questions or concerns please send a message to <a href=""http://communitycrew.livejournal.com""><b>communitycrew</b></a> and one of the Crew will get back to you ASAP, thank you!

Please do not send affiliate requests to this journal. Send those to <a href=""http://communitycrew.livejournal.com""><b>communitycrew</b></a>, thanks again!

If you need to contact me personally, send a message, it will go to my new email address so I will see it there.</font>"

so were riding and we get to the intersection in front of dauphin and were in the turn lane...
and i look in the rear view mirror
and theres this crazy weird dude waving and honking.
i didnt recognize who it was so i thought it was just some person with road rage and was about to cry cause i had no idea what i was doing wrong ,..imean youre really NOT supposed to turn left on red. so finally the light turns green and i turn,..and so does he,...and i get into the turn lane for dauphin,..and so does HE,...and then i turn and go to let abbey out and this guy pulls up right beside me and lets down the window,..so im freaking out thinking im being stalked,...
and i look closer,..
and its John Sawyer!
haha. we had a good time,..
he got to ride with m and see how good my driving skills are;)
even though i did run that stop sign :/my mistake.

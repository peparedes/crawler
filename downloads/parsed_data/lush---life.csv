saturday: felt like shit
felt like the 5th wheel
just wanted to stay home
so i pretended to be asleep and 
sat in the car alone instead

sunday:pianted all day
got alot of things off my chest
that i needed to

monday:no school so it counted as the weekend
hungout with the usuals
being the 5th wheel

today:the day started im getting alot of pop-ups
this shitty ass computer
i bet its from all those gay sites 
my brother goes on
i will be painting and not go to school"

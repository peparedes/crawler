"event","Wow. Finals begin on Monday. It's hard to believe it's summer. We're going to be juniors, I guess that's the hardest to process.

Since June started, I've been taking the bus after school seeing as there is no point in buying a pass for the train. It's a lot more fun, mainly because there are so many people who take the bus, that it makes you overlook the uncomfortable standing, squished between two strangers who you strike a conversation with. Vlad, apparently, lives like a block away from me, so there's someone I can take the bus with all the way from school and still walk part of the way home with.

I don't think I want this school year to end/"

You can see bright lights making the ground sparkle
Gentle chords soothes the ears
Little children make magic with their smiles
Colorful packages under a bushel of green
Let yourself become a child all over again"

Look at a child
The blank canvas they behold
To put dark forlorning colors on such an innocence
Will haunt you beyond a time when your eyes close in a dark sleep"

The chains are heavy

To cry over scraped knees
Duck Duck Goose was the most intriguing game
To laughing at simple things
To swinging in the sun
When you could be the prince or the princess of the Jungle Gym Castle
To days when problems were petty
To being a child, stay one as long as you can"

I didn't open my eyes today
I have no reason to do so"

"event","The twinkle of lights, a twinkle in a child's eyes
Little trinkets bring a smile
A time when there is a star for everybody
How does one hold to such wonderful things
I often want to live in this world
A place of wonder and dreams
What definition is worthy of this feeling
You are experiencing an incredible ecstasy
Up in the clouds above all is where your soul lies
The world at your finger tips
So you can fly, high like a cloud
Somewhere where a happy tear turns into a diamond
In the box on the floor
The sky was locked
But turned the key was with a twinkle in a heart
A single twinkle of faith was realized
Little bits of pink sweetness
A person can become a star
How can there be something so amazing?
I think this place is easily achieved.
The taste of wonder.
What you are is you."

There is a young lady painted there
She sits simply, legs together
Two hands gently placed
Her skin seems flawless
Her clothes show status and taste
The little droplets are on her face
The painting was titled Blank Canvas
If this young lady was so blank
Then why are there tears rushing down her cheeks"

Things will happen
But more often if you don't move
Nothing will ever come

Waiting for you
But you will never come
Because I continue to sit
Looking from afar
Trying to grab at something 
It's just out of reach"

I will always be there
When night pulls its blanket over familiar eyes

I hope I can realize myself

Is it a trick of the light?
I think to hard about everything
I should get paid for worrying
Because I do it like its my job
I make myself believe false truths
I am told that I can get what I want
But I feel constantly held back
Held back by what ifs and negative scenarios
Do you think I make my life difficult?
Is it a trick of my mind?"

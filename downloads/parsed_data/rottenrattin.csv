"event","HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME IN FOUR DAYS!!!! I'll be 20! My dad said he is getting me a yummy vanilla cake with raspberry jelly stuff for my partay slumber partay thingy. And I told him he should put bats on it. And he was like, how do you spell Scarah, lol!!!

Errr.. I should probably write in here more often. But I've been doing so much writing its not even funny! I'm making Dayna a book lol.

I have to get going, I have to go to the bank and  post office today and pay off my almost $200.00 for auction stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!

Then I have to go to the grocery store and dollar store to pick up stuff for my slumber partay. And I might look for some nerdy stuff for my Valentines swap partner from goth auctions. You never know. There might be something cool there. And at least I can buy her some candy at the grocery store. But seriously, I want to go to Rite Aid. They have SO much cool V-day stuff right now it's not even FUNNY! Giggle.

Okie dokie, Well, Bye bye bye!

I went looking for trouble
And boy, I found her

She's in love with herself
She likes the dark
And on her milk-white neck
The devil's mark

Now it's All Hallow's Eve
The moon is full
Will she trick or treat?
I bet she will
She will

She's got a date at midnight
With Nosferatu
Oh, baby, Lilly Munster
Ain't got nothing on you

Now when I called her evil
She just laughed
She put that spell on me
Boo Bitch Craft

Yeah, you wanna go out 'cuz it's rainin' and blowin'
You can't go out cuz your roots are showin'
Dye 'em black
Dye 'em black

Black number one

Little wolf skin boots
And clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral
For which she's dressed
Her perfume smells like
Burning leaves
Everyday is Halloween

Lovin' you was like lovin' the dead

It was like fucking the dead"

"event","Helloooo there! Today is my day off... But, I don't really think today should have been my day off... B/c it doesn't feel like one. But yeah... This morning I had to get up at 7 a.m. so I could go to the Monday morning meeting, but today we did a merchandising module, it was all mostly stuff we already knew... Elaine didn't come today either.

After that was over... I had an hour to kill before I rode the bus home. Sooo I went to Baskin Robins and had a scoop of Jamoca Almond Fudge for breakfast. Then I bought a 2004 Boston Terriers calender, b/c I mean.. Look at them. Though, I probably should not have bought that, since I am broke!!! Which reminds me I need to take those boots and that Hello Kitty snow globe back to work. Damn it, I hate the bus. LOL. I almost forgot about riding it til now.

I want a nap. But Garrett is going to call me to come to his house sometime tonight... So I need to stay awake or else I won't go to his house. I also need to go clean my room. But if I go up there, I will want a nap. Which I already want. But damn!!! Stupid winter.. Makes me so tired. And 7 a. m. makes me tired too!!! BLEH

I'm expecting a lot of stuff in the mail from EWbay. Well not a lot, just a couple.. 1. Lip Service Skunk Rock gown in size medium brand new. 2. Morbid threads coats 3. Black vinyl size 10 boots from Hot Topic (Cute strappy dominatrix looking ones! I love them dead!) Then I should be getting a stocking swap package in the mail from Goth auctions.. Hopefully anyways! Ooooh I thought of something else I'm expecting in the mail! 4. Lip Service From Dusk Til' Dawn Peacock bloomers! Now I have bloomers and a skirt, all I need is a top!

Dayna is coming down from Washington on Saturdee... She will be here til January something! GOOD!

I spent way too much money on Xmas this year! I can't believe it! Next year I won't spend so much! But I got a lot of cool stuff for Garrett and everyone. So I hope they will like it!

Okie dokie, I'm going to go now.
Peace out ninja lover!

"event","Ugh, two split shift days in a row. I'm so tired. And my head is broken. AND the people at Baskin Robins totally sassed me. I'm going to talk to the manager. Hehe.. I'm such a biz.

Tomarrow Janet is picking me up from work and I am going with her, Jen, Dayna, and Nicole to the... BLEH.. Good Charlotte concert. I don't even know how I got dragged into that. I mean... I missed the Genitortuers, I'm going to miss KMFDM, Type O Negative AND Cradle of Filth b/c of that... Those bands are all A LOT better. Damn them all. I wish I could go to Type O or at least KMFDM. I'm going to die now. Oh well. At least I can listen to their cds... : \

Then luckily, Wednesday is my day off... I'm going to go stay over at Garrett's house. And be mad at Scavenger.. Since she was harressing the squirrel and hurt his tail. I'm so mad at that cat. She needs to be smacked around some for that. Don't touch my nut muncher Scavenger! I want to go see Elf with Garrett, but I don't know if he and I will be able to on Wednesday. I still want us to get our pictures taken together too... Yup... Damn it all to hell and back again.

Okay, so we hired 6 new people.... So that makes:

Chris, Toph - Manager
Ross, Boss - FT ASM
Sarah (Me), Scarah - PT ASM
Justin, JMD - Keyholder
Elaine - Associate
Rhainna, Rhain - Associate
Rebecca, Chewbecca - Associate
Derek, Ace - Associate
Vanessa - Associate
Andrew, Andy - Associate (Seasonal)
Ashley, Hannah - Associate (Seasonal)
Alex - Associate (Seasonal)
Wayne, Mr. Rogers - Associate (Seasonal)
Judy - Associate (Seasonal)
Adam - Associate (Seasonal)

That's are big huge team!!! *Dance dance dance*

Okie dokie, I'm going to go eat some food, call my bunny head, watch the Halloween adult swim Garrett recorded me b/c he wuvs me (teehee) and then go to bed! I'm so damn tired! I should probably go wash my hair, but since I'm going to that concert tomarrow I might as well do it after the concert since it's going to be covered in dumb jumpy giddy little kids sweat and slobber. EWWWW!!!

Bye bye bye!

"event","Hey there! I havn't updated this bad mother in a while, so I thought I would.

Tomarrow, my day off, isn't really a day off. At 8:30 I need to meet Rossco, Rosstafarian, Boss Ross, Rossy Bossy, Rizzigity Ross, you get it, at work. We are doing group interviews at 9-10. How fun. I hope we have some awesome people this time. I'm getting tired of doing interviews for people that don't care about anything more then our discount. It's kind of sad really. Since Hot Topic is an awesome company. Then later on tomarrow at 7 pm - 9 pm we have a managers meeting to prepare for new hires and the all store meeting on the 16th, but that will be less stressful then the interviews...

MONDAY! HOLY MOLY! We are doing a total store flip. Mens wall to womens wall, etc. That will be exciting, and fun once it's all over. (The work part of it I mean) We are also getting 10 boxes in shipment that day, so we will be busy for a week. LOL.

Sigh, I got my paycheck, but cannot cash it until Monday. I got some horrendous debts. They took out 200 bucks in taxes too! EEP! That's a lot. Hopefully I get a check at the end of the year. That would be rad. And hopefully I get a second check for making bonus.. MMM....

The other day me and Garrett had the most wonderful time. I wish we got along that perfect everyday. : )

Speaking of Garrett and his house, which I am now speaking of.... He got a squirrel! Yea! I love it, it's precious, and we are keeping him.

Tomarrow Elaine might stay the night so she can come to work with me on monday at 6 am. So I need to go clean my room and wash my bed stuffs. So she  doesn't think that I'm a complete slob, like I am. hehe...

Okie dokie, time to clean and play with Tator Tot.

And put away all of my new clothes. *GRIN*

"event","Things are very bleh... Work is going fine. The rest of life is kind of bleh though... I can't find my Cyber Industrial Ninja Babe shirt by Sigh-Co Graphics either. If I don't find it by payday, I'm just going to order another one. And if I find the old one, it's not like you can ever have too many of that shirt... So, Yeah, I'll probably order another one. But I cannot remember if I got a small one or a medium one.. I think I'll go view my auction history now.. Heh... Lame. Tomarrow I work, Sunday I work, Monday I work, and then on Tuesday I don't work and I'm going to hang out with Garrett... Wee... I love him. He is nice and a nerd. That is a very good mix. OOoooh It was a small. Weeeee!!! Maybe I will order a medium this time? But the small fit so so so well. Even Garrett liked how it fit me. I don't think the medium will have much of a differnce though. So maybe I will just order it. I think I may order some other shirts they have too... 

Today I bought 3 Game Boy Games. A Ren and Stimpy one called Space Cadets, Super Mario Land and Super Mario Land 2. I also bought my cd I had orderd from Sam Goody. Before They Were Punk 2. It is an alright cd. I just like it b/c I hear it so much at work. LoL.

Anyways, I'm going to go now. Bye.

Which isn't too shabby. Then that friday is a payday. So looks like I'm gonna get to do some shopping! WOOHOO!!! Sounds good to me... We are going to go to the Hot Topic there, then this cool store called Metro that sells Lip Service as well. She wants us to get tattoos.. But we only will if she has cash..

Tomarow I'm gonna go to Garrett's house. He is picking me up at 10:30 PM. B/c he is going to be doing some night manageing at the park. Late, but worht it. And plus if he is tired, it's not like it is too early to try to get some rest or anything....

But yeah. I'm gonna go. Bye bye bye...

Charlie has 2 days to live, and I don't think she will be able to enjoy them, and I doubt she even knows she is alive now... She overdosed on meth and will die no matter what. She also had an abortion a week ago.. So maybe that added to her weakness? I'm not sure.. She is only 14... R.I.P... Poor Nicole. Hopefully she will never do it again..."

"event","Today was my day off. Vanessa came over. We watched Return to Oz, Lord of the Rings 2 and Little Nikki on tv. By the way, I thought Little Nikki was freaking retarded. There were like a few slightly funny parts, but not enough funniness for me to even say I liked it a little. I mean, I'd never watch it again unless there was absolutely nothing else to do.. Anyhow... We also went to 7-11. I got a cherry slurpee, some onion sun chips (which weren't as good as I had hoped for), some really yummy teryaki beef jerky that I ate too quicky (mmm), and lastly a Hostess lemon fruit pie. I hate the crust, but the lemon filling is tasty. We also went through both of our make ups and made a few trades. She has a lot more then anyone I've seen! Fancy smancy! 

DAMN NO MORE KLEENEX??? God forbid... Now what??? Ugh!!! I mean, ARRG!

Tomarrow I have to work 8 AM - 4:30 PM... I did most of my stupid home work already. I just have to write what I need to improve on now, and it should be satisfactory... Ashley's will probably be better then mine, but at least I did it.. Half assed of course... You can't expect me to do stupid shit like that.. I mean I love work, and will do stuff on my own time.. But for the life of me I will not do something that someone calls homework. It's just not in me... Hehe..

After work I'm gonna go over to Garrett's house. But I seemed to have sunken into a hole full of anger/hate/depression again. So I'm not sure as to what kind of company I will be. And hope that I will not be a big asshole to him... It's not him, it's not anyone.. It's just me... Too much work stuff, and no time to do anything else it seems I guess.. And I hang out with Garrett like twice a week and other friends like twice a month it seems. Especially now that Dayna's gone. Though, she calls for hours of internet fun. Can't go wrong there. She is hilarious!

I got that bird today. It doesn't really go for the whole, ""Hey I'm a bird, you are a person, please be nice to me and hold me and love me,"" scenerio.. More like, ""Hey I'm a bird, I look in my mirror all day long and poop, leave me the hell alone or I'll bite you,"" type thing... But, whatever. At least I get to hear it screech and chirp all day and clean it's cage. Score and a half. Right? Hehe... Okay, so it's cute. But, I don't think it is trainable. Seeming how it is 2 years apparently. And apparently a boy. And nameless, by the way.

I need to get a printer cord.
I need to vaccume my room.
I need to clean my rats cage.
I need to put out some water to distill and clean the fish bowl.
I need to go to the post office and send off stuffs.
I need to go to the bank and fix their mishaps with my account.
I need to go to the bank and cash lots of things.
I need to save some cash for taxes.
I need to learn to drive.
I need to save up some money for an apartment.
I need to get rid of some shit.
I need to organize my room.
I need to start excersising.
I need to quit being lazy.
I need to get my priority's straight.

Where the freak do you get motivation to do all of these things?? I've been trying to figure that out forever and a day and it doesn't work no matter what...  I'm so disfunctional...

Speaking of disfuntional. What the hell is wrong with goth auctions right now?? Oh well, when payday comes around I might move a lot of my stuff to EBAY. I don't really want to, and it's not like I know what I'm doing on there, or know anything about it really, but it seems to me that I might make a little more money then on goth auctions for some of my good items... No one on here has even asked me about a lot of my awesome things... Bleh...

People just really piss me off... Everyone is too involved in their own little world to care about anything else but themselves and the people that do care never have time due to other circumstances. I dunno. Maybe a lot of it is me. I have no clue. 

Anyways, I'm gonna go. I should probably get something to eat and then go to bed. Since it is 12:16.. Which means I have about 6 and 1/2 hours to sleep. Errr.. At least Tuesday is my day off. I will have loads of fun cleaning the rat's cage, going to the bank, and going to the post office. If I am lucky I might have some time to actually read some of the Ravenloft books I ordered. Wouldn't that be fun. I have like 6 or more books that are brand new and havnt' been touched.. And it sucks so bad not to have time to read them... The ones I know I have are:

Tapestry of Dark Souls (Ravenloft Series)
The Enemy Within (Ravenloft Series)
The Hobbit - Tolkein
Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring - Tolkien
Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  - Tolkein
Lord of the Rings: Return of the King - Tolkien
Love in Vein - Poppy Z. Brite

And there are probably others... I know I have ordered 3 other Ravenloft books that should be here within the next 2 weeks as well.. I can read one of these books in a day, but it's just waiting for those days to come around...

I want to move in with Garrett. But, I don't have enough money. If Ashely moves to Clackamas Town Center and I get assistant manager that would probably help out a lot though. But, who knows if and when he wants to. It's not like we don't have time though. I don't think I'm going to die any time soon. I hope not anyways..

My stupid stitches on my boob feel infected. They are hurting and are swollen. I'm wondering if I should call the doctor or just ask Janet about it when I call her tomarrow to ask her about driving me to Portland this week.. I'll probably just ask her when I call, seeming I may call her about it tomarrow anyhow.. It's not like the doctor would do much cept probably put me on some sort of stupid anti biotic.. Probably some generic thing and something not that great, since I'm allergic to so much...

Anyways... G'Night

"event","Aww how sad... 3 of my best buddies are leaving... :*( Ashley is going to be a full time manager in Clackamas town Center, my step sister Dayna leaves for Washington tomarrow morning...  And my new friend  Vanessa will be going to school in Portland very soon... Ashley will luckily still live in Salem for a while, and she said she might take me up there to work with her a couple times, if not at least once.. Since, they are going to be moving into a bigger location at the end of October! How exciting!!! Then tonight I got to hang out with Dayna for like 2 hours. And she gave me her address so we will have to send packages and snail mail as well as talk online every day!!! I dont' get to see her in person often, but she is really one of my best friends. We always have the funniest jokes and stuff. Then lastly, tomarrow me and Vanessa are going to hang out here, and she will still come to Salem on weekends and stuff. So hopefully I can see her more. She is really cool and is into a lot of the same fashion stuff I am, and is just really nice in general. And she appriciates Halloween just as much as I do. *Grin*

OOH! Hot Topic finally came out with some baby clothes. Me and Dayna are so getting Kaitlynn some gothy baby onsies and shirts!!! And prolly some punky ones too. To give the kid some variety. : )

Anyways, if Ashley moves to Clackamas, which she probably is for sure, I might get the part time assistant manager position here in Salem Center... Which would be good for me. Move me up in the company, give me more responsibility and lastly but not leastly, I'd get insurance.. Not dental though. But hey, can't complain.. Plus, assisant manager's get bonuses and stuff. So, makes things more tolerable. : P

Last night closing I did everything right cept staple the papers togetherr in the correct order.. Oh darn... Big mistake.. Though I thought I messed up.. Apparently I didn't.. Woohoo!

Well, time to decide if I'm gonna list some stuffs on ebay or not... Dun Dun Dun...

"event","The bank is a big jerk. Though, I think they got their ""jerk"" karma... B/c today when I went to cash my auction payments the drive through was closed due to an emergency it said... So we drove around to the front and it was all taped off with yellow caution stuff and cops were there... Well, that is what they get for being mean to me... Hehe.. Even though I don't even know what was going on....

My friend Vanessa, from work, has a friend who wants to get rid of a parakeet. So I asked my grandma and she actually said I could have it... Very strange since I begged her for a kitten the other day and she wouldn't give in... Maybe I loosened her up a bit, and she decided a bird was better then a cat? Anyways, the bird is nameless, around 2-3 years old, and is a blue, yellow and neon greenish parakeet! Woohoo! Sounds good to me.. So far that means I have a land animal (rat), water animals (3 fish) and now an air animal (the bird)... But, I still need more... : P

I was supposed to stay at Garrett's house tonight, but he said he had to get up early to do an estate sale... But he isn't answering his phones, so I don't know where he went... After I found out I couldn't go over there, I thought I'd call Dayna and ask her to hang out b/c she is going to be moving up to Washington for school very soon. She said yes, but later on called and told me she couldn't now... So basically I was alone today.

Tomarrow I'm supposed to go to Garrett's after work though.. But, I might not go if I can't get a hold of him tonight. Due to me needing to make proper arrangements.

Today I sent off payment for lots of things. I sent the money for the Lip Service Requim For The Dead Frock from Karen, and a Heavy Red bodice and a striped Lip Service jacket. Then I sent payment to blackdaisies for some Beautifully Chaotic black and purple realistic dreadfalls. I belive them to be just like the black and white ones I got from SallyX. Hopefully anyways... : P I can't remember what else I sent off at the moment... Cept some letters to Jizzy, Rachel, Trudy and Marda.

I really want the Lady is a Tramp set from Lip Service. But so far Karen's rep doesn't know the date on that. So I have to continue to TRY to be patient. But I always feel like a jerk b/c I constantly ask her about it... There is a Tramp bra on Ebay, but there is 8 days left on it with no flashbuy... So I am assuming it will end up at a billion dollars...

Anyways, I'm gonna go now.
Bye.

I just got home from work like 30 min. ago. Normally I would have been home a little after 7:15, but me, Chris, Ross and Sassley stayed for a meeting. So we didn't have to come in for one in the morning... I had to close. Chris taught me. It isnt' that hard I suppose... Tomarrow I think I have to open, then I have to close again tomarrow, but this time with Ashley.

Errrrr.. My grandpa some how decided that he needs to get the roof replaced.. Why did he waste all summer long, and when it finally starts to rain again, decide we need a new roof? And since I live on the top floor.. I have to be the one to prepare for it... Move all of my stuff and be completely inconvienced... I can't very well sleep in the basement while they do it.. Too freaking cold. Anyways, I'm probably just bitching, but still.. Pisses me off just the same. When they previously told me they were waiting til next summer...

I got my goth auctions halloween swap partner.. Want to know who it is? Tee hee hee.. Too bad. Hint: It's a girl. LOL.. Like most of the people on the forums are girls.. Haha..

Yesterday Mel stayed the night. We watched Return to Oz and The Willies. She somehow didn't like Return to Oz... I like it just fine. : P We also ate ice cream and had McDonalds. How healthy of us.. Hehe... We actually started to get tired by 11:00 pm, it was odd. But we ended up staying up until 1 AM. OOH, we also watched the movie Beetle Juice. I almost forgot.

Last night I also got a lot of my auction stuff taken care of, and a lot of letters that needed to be written and sent off prepared. It's about time. I never feel like there is enough time in the day to get things done...

Today I bought two skirts from the Deb. One plain black witchy looking 3/4th one. And one 3/4th black one with a layer of pothole fishnet material over it.. Very interesting. I'm hoping they both fit okay. I got mediums, but the black witchy one looks failry small. Definately probably have to wear it on my waist, b/c I highly doubt I could stretch it to get it over my hips, despite it being made out of spandex and something else.. Hahha, what if it was only made out of spandex... : P I also bought Garrett a Freddy Krugar claw from Spencers Gifts INC. I should have waited til we got ours in at work, but I didn't want to chance not getting him one.. (OMG I WANT THE PINHEAD DOLL THERE!!!) Garrett's old Freddy Claw is ruined times ten... Then I bought two Vargas lunchboxes from Hot Topic and a magizine and some stationary stuff. Oh and some ring pops and a necklace... The lunch boxes were only $2.97..  They are not for me though. I'm going to give them to people for X-Mas. That is such a great deal...

Anyways, I don't want to type anymore. I want to go to bed. But I still have like 10 auctions to repost. Bleh! Oh well.. Money is good.

I don't know what it is called either, so that might have something to do with it? In the song it says, ""I'm going to sell me some sex tonight."" It's a really rad song though. Wev'e just been listening to that cd recently at work, so yeah, need to find it now... Heh.

Last night I stayed over at Garrett's house. But we didn't really do much but hang out. We walked to the store and got some soda. He got Code Red Mountain Dew and I got The Blue Pepsi. I brought home a Big Mac for me and a Chicken Fajita Subway sandwich for him. So dinner was scrumdiddlyumptious. Heh.

Then this morning I went to the mall and got Kiwi some more patches and myself a patch from Hot Topic. JMD was there. Nice seeing him for once. I never ever see him! Ross and Ashley were there also. They seemed to be pretty busy today. And, it is a Saturday, and to top it all off, it is still spring break for kids. After that I used my free sandwich card at Subway for the sweet oinion chicken teriyaki. I also got a bowl of roasted chicken soup. That soup was so good. MMM...

Later today, I went to Rachel's mom and dad's house. That is were she is staying right now. Me and her and her sister watched the movie ""Mystic Pizza"" and ate pizza (Yea for pepperoni). I chipped in $2 bucks. I ate 1 and 1/2 peices. So yeah. That's about right I suppose? But I also brought the soda that we all drank. So, it was more evened out that way. We were going to watch that movie with Jennifer Lopez in it, but they got too tired. Oh welly!

I'm not sure if me and Rachel are going to go to the Motorhead and Dwarves concert now, since it is kind of spendy. $20.00, plus fees. That isn't that bad, but we are going to go to The Faint soon too, and then we are going to get tattoos. Well, she is just getting hers touched up, but I want to get my GWAR one. Tee hee. I am not sure if I want to get the part of the tatoo that is white or not, I could just leave it skin color. Which would probably be cheaper anyways. And if I did that, I could always get it colored in later... And I could just do that at Addictions or something. I am getting this one done at Hot Rod Betties when I go and get my Scrumper peirced. I am thinking I should get the tattoo first, and then get the peircing after. That way I don't have double discomfort while I get my tat. Woohoo, modification day! I hope that we are going to the concert the day before our tattoo stuff. I think we are, but I can't really remember? Anyways!

Last night was the Flogging Molly concert. Rachel had lots of bruises. I guess her and her sis were in the mosh pit most of the time. I wonder how Becca came out? Heh. I'm not really mad that I didn't get to go. Since, I already have allergies, I don't need to have a broken arm too. Heh.

I need to call Cousin Brian, Cousin Danielle, Michelle that was seasonal at Hot Topic, Cousin Chris, hmm... I probably have a bigger list then that. I'm slacking! I need a good bitch slapping to keep me on track. I'm so bored. Anyways... I'm going to go now. So ttyl.

Anyways. I'm not really sick, but I have a sore throat. I don't know why though. I've basically downed a whole Powerade in hopes of making it feel better. Grr.. Oh welly. Anyhow...

Today I went to work at like 5:55 A.m. and started at 6:00 A.m. We did a floor move. The back wall turned into a Matrix theme, the gift wall moved onto the right wall where the car and bathroom stuff was, the hats just moved completely down, as did everything else on that wall, and we condensed the girls section completely. We changed the fixtures around too. It was me, Chris, Rachel, RVI, Ashley and Andrew. Rhain was going to come, but she was sick, so that's why Andrew was there. He was covering her shift.

Then later on today, Crystal came over like at, um, I don't know, 1 something. Then at 2:30 we went to the Armory and we watched the Shrine Circus. It was damn expensive!!! $16.00 to get in the door! I had to loan Crystal 4 bucks. Then I bought some nachos for $3 something. The first act was the tigers. The tamer was a female, which I am not used to... She was okay, but the cats didn't listen to her very well. They were feisty. Heh. Then there was acrobats, tight rope walkers, um, chinese acrobats that did karate stuff and pole climbing, trapeze, and the elephants did all sorts of cute tricks... It was fun, but I came back home from it with a sore throat! :*(

Tator Tot is doing well. He still has a bit of a cold, but I don't think he has Pneumonia anymore. Hopefully not anyways. Because I cannot afford to take him to the vet or buy him medicine. So, yeah...

Anyhow, I'm going to go now, I have to go get my teeth drilled out in the morning and I dont' want to waste the rest of my awake time on here like usual.. So bye...

But, unfortunately that isn't going to last that long. Since my grandparents are coming back from their friends house now and they called and told me it will be about 20 minutes until they get here... Hmm...

Anyhow. So last night me and Crystal and Trudy went to another one of those Freedom Productions concerts. It was lame, but it was better then nothing. We mainly went there because Andrew wanted us to see him and duh, Terminal Complex. They are so silly. Kyle ""killed"" the drums at the end.. Heh. Not really, but it looked like it. Now I have two Terminal Complex stickers in pink. Haha. Pink. I ended up winning another contest at that show. Eating contest. I had to outeat some guys and I did. Two donuts and two bottled waters... EWW. I won this voice distorter called ""The Rave Master"". It is cool.

Garrett about had a heart attack on me last night. He lectured me and pissed me off about alchohol. Even though I didn't even drink anything at all. But oh well... I am just not going to get into that.... Since. Growl.

Got up at 9:00 am, Becca picked me up, went to Rachel's, and we all made cookies. Becca left early. But while she was there, we did get most of the snow man cookies and no-bake cookies done... When Becca left we made m&m and chocolate chip cookies too. Then we made frosting and decorated all of the snow men! Heh. We mad some hooker/strippers, a karate guy, some sterotypical snowmen, a rat, um, and some old ladies? Rachel also showed me some of her stuff and gave me and Becca some fizzy bath bombs and some soap she made last night. Good X-mas gifts! : ) I had a lot fun, and on the way home to my house (Rachel and Brandon gave me a ride) we stopped in at her friends house. I think her name was Lauren? Because they needed help getting there big screen t.v inside the house...

Then, I came home, beat a scenario of War Craft 2 as I waited for my dad and Garrett to arrive. Dad got here, then like 15 minutes later Garrett got here. Then we high tailed it to West Salem to Grandma Ball's house. First we did Jeff's b-day stuff and ate hamburgers. Then my dad had to read a long long letter from Uncle Johnny to all of us. It made my Grandma Ball, bawl, Janet cried and Danielle cried. And, I felt bad, but didn't really understand why. Heh. (Uncle Johnny's in Jail.) (Speaking of Uncle Johnny, apparently I have a cousin that I didn't know about! He had another kid. That is so fucked up. That means I just found out I have another cousin. Danielle doesn't even know her. But, Nicole is like her friend or something?) Anyhow, we opened all of our presants and Garrett made a pretty good haul for a last minute notice sort of thing. Plus, I gave him all of my slipper socks and this weird UFO fiber optic thingy ma jig. I got the coolest ""Tekno Kitten"". It is the most fucking industrial toy I've seen. It is so cute!!! I lost the part that was a fish that says ""Kitty"" on it somehow on the way home. I belive it to be either in West Salem or in the back of my dad's truck's bed. I'll have to ask my dad tomarrow I guess? After that...

We took Garrett home, We as in my dad and I. I felt bad for being a jack-jerk to him all day. But I was cranky from lack of food and from this shitty sore throat I have!!! Grr. It makes me mad just thinking about it! Bastards! Garrett said he liked his stuff, so that is way good. And he was amazed by how much stuff we all got. Spoiled. LOL. Well, the most spoiled was Jeff's kids of course!!! But at least I made out with 3 Hot Topic gift cards by the end of the night!! A total of $60.00. Which means, with my discount I can spend $100.00 store price!!! Yeehaw! Good stuff. (One card was from Mariann, one was from Jeff, Christina, Jennifer, Jessica and Lola, and the other one was from my step-sister Jennifer. Awwww...)

Then we went back to my dad's where Janet, Dayna, Nicole, and Jennifer were already at. My dad kept prolonging the time to open gifts. But it was b/c he had talked Jeff into coming and was secretly waiting for him. (You see, Jeff and Janet got into a fight. And he was so mad he wasn't going to come over at all... But, he did and they had some strange hug and Janet looked like she was going to cry again.) I got a lot of stuff I wanted from Hot Topic. There's only a few more things I really want from there. Heh. For now. I am such a nerd!!!

Then, after dad's house. He took me home and helped me take all of my stuff upstairs... It was a lot to take up there, yup... So now I am here. Writing this. But, I had better go now. I have to get up early in able to be able to take a bath before the relatives make it over here. Psychos I tell you... So, byebye!!!

"event","Hey there. I just got back from the Hot Topic party thingy at Sarah's house. It was pretty fun. But, there were other people there that were not from Hot Topic. It was way cool anyhow. Heh. Let's see, Rachel was there and her hubby Brandon, Becca, Chris, Ross, RVI, Andrew, Elaine, Yarrow, Joel, Bo, Rhain and Rob, um Yarrow brought her room mate... Hmm.. Then there was a lot of people there I didn't know. And um duh, Sarah and Me Sarah were there.

We just mainly all sat around and talked. And I never realized how much of partyers Chris and Ross are. And Bo was pretty shit faced too. Heh. We ordered like 10 pizzas, we all pitched in five bucks and that was fine. The total was only like $45.00. And we gave a $5.00 tip. So, $50.00 total! I had pepperoni pizza.

When we exchanged gifts I didn't get to see what everyone got.. But, Andrew loved his presant from me. I guess he collects super hero stuff, so that totally worked out that I gave him that Incredible Hulk movie! Heh. Rachel ended up being my secret santa and she got me GIR socks, the china girl stlyed underwear and Nightmare Before X-mas trading cards. We also exchanged our other gifts. I got her those shoes, a hello-kitty pen, some heart stickers and a bat shaped soap in the scent of honey almond. And she gave me the KMFDM shirt! Woohoo! (RAD) I am going to wear it tomarrow! Tee hee!

We took pictures too. Me and Grandma went to Bi-mart before the party and I got two disposable cameras for $8.00! That's a good buy, and it's fujifilm. We took shots of just the girls, just the guys, then one of Rhain and Rob, one of Rachel and Brandon, one of me and Becca, one of Andrew, one of the girls with RVI being a weirdo asian in the back. LOL.. And a couple other random ones. I still have to take pictures to fill up the camera. There were like 27 exposures, and I still have like 16. I hope all of those turn out! If they don't, I'll be so so sad!

Garrett is hanging out with Brendon, Jordan and Alex tonight. They are all shit faced drunk. Maybe that is his revenge for me going to Andrew's house party last night? Even though all I drank was a diet Pepsi and a sip of blackberry something becuase Crystal had it.

Dude, Crystal and Eric were all up on eachother, it was sick. She let him all grope her and shit. She still hangs out with him even though he has a different girl friend... You would think that she would get it into her head that it's not working. And she better not even try to date Andrew while she is fucking Eric. That is so not cool. I would be like, hey, no the fuck way... It's pretty rude. But, I suppose she hasn't asked Andrew out anywhere anyways... But, at least Andrew wouldn't cheat on her ass. Oh well.. Not my problem. So I shouldn't get mad about it.

The United Bubble Gum band played again last night at Andrew's house. They are so cool. I don't know, they just really get your juices going if that makes any sense? And Fatty Matty B. makes the most happy coolest faces I've ever seen! LOL. Well, I am sure it has something to do with the energy involved with singing and playing the drums. And he just has a downright awesome personality. Well, from what I have seen anyways... Then I gave Griff my e-mail address. He said he would e-mail me about any info. on them, any show dates/times and when they are going to release their cd! Yea! That is, if he remembers, there is no telling how drunk he decided to get last night...

Becca is going to come over here sometime soon. She wants to help me eat all of the mandarin oranges. Heh. There are a lot. And they are yummy in my tummy. She wants me to bring her one tomarrow too.. So, I will if I remember. But, I think she works til' seven. So, hopefully I remember. I work from five to close. With Rachel! Woo!! Hee hee...

Well, I am going to get going... So bye bye!

"event","Hey there. Today was a long hard day. I didn't have to work until five, but when I got there, there was a lot to be done. I ended up hurting my neck really bad some how. I took a muscle relaxer and a pain killer like 45 minutes ago. So I hope that helps.

There was this guy in the corner by the dressing room today at work, right? He was pretending to sing in a microphone and he was like totally rocking out by himself looking in the mirror. And making poses and flexing and wouldn't let anyone else look in the mirror. He did that for like 25 minutes or so. What a crack head.... No one knew why he was doing it either.

My Skunk Rock jackets not here yet! : ( I am so so so sad. I hope it didn't get lost in the mail. They havn't tracked it since the 17th. And today is like the 20th. I was thinking that's just maybe b/c it's in the USA now and it was being tracked in Canada. Because the last tracking record said that it was dispatched from Canada. I am assuming that means to the USA? If I don't get it by Monday. I am going to have to figure out what's up....

I bought Rachel's shoes today, and my secret santa (Andrew) a bracelet with skulls and studs on leather, I also bought Garrett the same bracelet that I bought Andrew. Then, I got Andrew a Fight Club button, b/c he likes Fight Club. I still have some money left. Thank god for good bidders on goth auctions. I got like 80 bucks b/c I got the money from my catsuit and the money from the dreads....

Haha, Andrew has l33t written on his name tag at work. So I wrote him a whole message (e-mail) in it. He didn't reply back though. So I am wondering if he got it or not... Heh heh. I was all... ""H3y 7h3re, h0\/\/'5 17 901n9? 1/\/\ u83r 1n|}u57r14| n0\/\/ f001..."" J/k. That's not what I said. But I did write a pretty good e-mail in it. LOL.. 

But, yeah. I am going to go finish cleaning my room now. Since Garrett's coming over early in the morning! I wouldn't want him to see that huge ass mess up there. Plus, I need to hide some gifts from him! Hee hee. Even though I practically already told him everything I got him!!!

So, toodles ""g"" fool dawg!

Today I picked my secret Santa at work. I got a boy. I am not going to disclose who it is though, until after it's over. Just in case some of my information leaks out. LOL. I got him a poster so far... He had an extensive list just waiting to be purchased. LOL.. Although, you gotta love shopoholic boys. Don't cha? 

I also didn't go to Garrett's today. We were both too tired. So I am going over there tomarrow after he gets off of work. I don't work tomarrow! Yea! I needed a break (from work.) I've been way tired. But I am going over there for sure. I miss my bunny brains. He is such a cutie patootie!

I have a real shopping problem. It's really really bad. How did that happen? I freaking want everything... Grr.. I need to be rich and live with David Bowie in Beverly Hills, like on Clueless... I wish I was that rich. But, don't we all?

I just thought I would filter out some of my e-mail and check how my downloads were going, before going to bed... And, the downloads are going super slow as always. Never download Therion. (The only reason I am is because my friend Mike made me a Cinema Strange cd, so I told him I would make him any cd he wanted... And he chose Therion, so yup. That's the story.)

The whole freaking basement here is practically flooding. The guy that ""fixed"" the basement this summer sure did a good job! Boy oh boy. So anyhow, Grandma is going to call him to come back and fix it. The bastard! She shouldn't pay him anything this time... She paid him a ton last time and what he did didn't even work! The water is all the way from the wall by the freezer in the washing room, to almost right here where the computer is! Then, in the bedroom - it's leaking out of the closet and from under the window area. Grrr... It's annoying and gross. I don't want to step in it.

I ended up getting a hold of Trudy today. Well, actually, I left three messages and she ended up calling me back. She forgot we were going to hang out today! She slept til' late. Oh well, I slept in pretty good too! When I went over there we had to drive to the coffee shop because she left her notepad thingy with her phone numbers and other stuff on the table last night during the parade. When we asked them about the lost and found, they only had her purple gel pen. But someone else picked up her note pad... So, hopefully she gets it back! Otherwise that would suck! Then, we went over to my mom's house and petted Dixie. I also got some Vanilla coke in a glass, a couple packets of hot cider and hot coacoa, mom gave me a box of candy canes, two huge things of gatorade (as an early X-mas presant), and a big bag of presants to put under grandma's tree for Christmas. Nicole got a black light! A big one! : ( LOL, I wanted that! (I'm such a brat.) Then, Billy let me borrow the dvd Monster's Inc. I havn't seen it yet, and I really want to! So, I'll have to do that on one of my days off!!! After Mom's house, me and Trudy went back to her place, watched a bunch of weird shit on t.v., ate some Strawberry Cream ice cream (It was soo soo good!), I got attacked by the dogs, and licked to death(!), I transfered some of my pictures from her computer to mine (still need to get the pictures of my auctions over here!!!), and I got some of my mail! I feel bad, I got my item I traded with MsManatee, but she hasn't gotten hers yet. Hopefully soon.....

Anyhow, I had better go upstairs and start recording Rosses' Manson movies again. I should have started those earlier. But, I am a lazy turd I guess? So bye bye for now. Oh yeah, I should say that I won't get to write in here a couple of days maybe because I am going to stay the night with Garrett tomarrow (and I am going there right after work.) and maybe on Tuesday night also. So, bye until then!

"event","Hey there. I got to sleep in this morning, so now I'm all happy slappy. I'm supposed to go to Trudy's today, but when I called her no one answered the phone! Grr.. Oh well, I'll try again later. Well, sooner then later. She was probably outside or something like that? Who knows.

Yesterday was tiring. First, I worked from 1:00-6:00, then at 6:30-7:30 was the parade. I only got to sit down for like five minutes on my break at work and eat McDonalds. And I didn't even get a pop, only water... And, I didn't even get a table, just a chair.. It sucked! So that is a long time to be on my feet on those crappy boots without insoles. (My old vinyl ones.) I didn't want to wear my new Docs because theyr'e white, and the parade would get them all gross looking.

Yesterday at work, Chris let me rearrange some of the girls section. It was cool. I mainly just moved the fishnet shirts by the Emily strange hoodys, the blue sparkly fishnet shirts by the fairy shirts, a gothy shirt in black and red by Emily stuff, some army looking shirts in place of the fishnets, some stripey shirts in place of the army shirts, which were once where I put the fishnets... Then some other random arranging was done. Chris said I am good in that area because I can throw outfits together better then some people. Which, I definately take as a compliment!!! I'm trying really hard to impress Chris, Ross and Rachel, without faking anything. Just being the best me I can be I guess?

At the parade, I walked by Christina and Jacob. (My new Aunt and Janet's brother's son.) I walked in the rear of the float, as I always do. I just wore my Lippy flight stimulator pants and my Gwar hoody. And my vinyl boots. I also wore my fake hair, it's way hard to get a stupid Santa hat over my choppy clip in falls! But, I did it. Surprisingly. After trying like fifty different ideas out... It was all cold and rainy, and I was having back spasms after it was over. But, at least I did it! 

Later on, Me, Grandma Ball, Grandpa Ball, Dad, Janet, Jeff, Christina, Jennifer, Jessica, Nicole and Janet's brothers girl Megan all went out to Denny's. I had the American Slam breakfast! Hashed browns, eggs with cheese, two pieces of toast, two sausage links, two bacon slices, and a side of fruit. The fruit was way good! I also ate some of Grandma Ball's cucumbers, a bite of her garlic bread, one cruton, lol and um, my sick parsley. What a meal. LOL. I ate every bit of it. I was freaking starving! I wish i could go out to eat every day!!!

It's getting so close to Christmas!!! I still don't have all of my shopping done. I still need to get Crystal a My Little Pony purse, the checkered tie from Hot Topic, and a journal or something. Then, I need to get Garrett the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac book, Rachel those shoes (which I'll do next time I get a spare $36.00)... On the 22nd, when I get my paycheck, I have to give Grandma Peterson $40.00 for the DSL bill, and Plastic Land Clothing $45.99 for the alien skin short dress size medium. I tried to win that on gothauctions.com like a month ago, but some girl outbid me! By like, $2.00!!! But, then the other day, PlasticLand contacted me and told me that they were deadbeated by her and offered it to me for the original price... Hell yeah!!! So, that is what I did. I'm so lucky that they are nice people and offered it to me! Though, it's quite spendy for me right now... Grr... I wish I wasn't a shopoholic!

Last night I had a dream that I had a lot of rodents in a box/cage thingy. Two little black mice, a bunch of white rats, one big huge ass black and white male rat, a bat (that had it's wings tied up weird for some reason) and some hampsters and things. It was so odd. And I was like, I better give some of the baby's away... And I had to get rid of the two black mice because they were afraid of the rats. It was so weird. I think I dreamt that because my rat kept making noises last night? Who knows? But probably.

Well, I had better get going.. I'm pretty dang hungry! So I have to go find something to eat asap before I ""die"". Okie dokie, ttyl!

"event","Hello there. I just got off of work like a half an hour ago. I closed with Chris. We didn't have any deposit bag thigys, so he will have to go make a personal deposit in the morning. Which isn't a great thing, it is better to do it when we are supposed to, but it really cannot be helped. I like closing with Chris and/or Rachel. I like closing period I guess. I like them. I like Ross too, but I especially get along with Rachel and Chris! LOL. 

When I was starting to get ready to close, my cousin Chris and Michael came in. I bought her a Bettie Page pin, because she was wearing a Bettie shirt and I needed to keep our upt at least at 2. Since, I finally found the Good Charlotte button that Dayna has been wanting! Grr.. I wouldv'e saved some money and bought a gumball eye, but I know she liked it.. So, what the hell?

Today Chris (work Chris) and I made a pact. He is going to start a savings account before January 24th, and I am going to start a bank account and a savings account. We are both shopoholics... Heh. It's so hard not to be. He is I think he said 24, and I am almost 19. So luckily, I'm trying now and so is he...

Also today, Grandma bought me the 14 eye white, with heel, stylish Doc Martens. They rock my socks! White, jesus mary!!! Heh. They were on sale for $50 dollars instead of $150.00!!! In my size! It is because they were disscontinued. God, Ozone always gets me great deals on Docs. They always have my size in the last cheap disscontinued boots! Woohoo, I'm a lucky gopher.

I wanted to relist some of my stuff from Goth Auctions. But, the site wouldn't load on my computer. Luckily before I went to work I relisted like 40 of them. And I only have like 8 more to relist. Darkdaysee bought my Monster velvet thigh highs with flash buy. I'm almost sad to see them go though, because they are so cute. I've never seen another pair that is for sure. Luckily she got it before my second thoughts went any further.. LOL.. I'm such a packrat!

Tomarrow is the parade... Dun dun dun. I work at 1 o'clock until 6 o'clock. Then, the parade starts at 6:30 and ends always around like 9 o'clock I think? So, I'm going to be so freaking tired... I'm NOT wearing my white boots in the parade, god knows what happens to my boots in the parade.. Sick! I hope my grandma doesn't get mad at me this year, because we aren't wearing costumes.. So, I will be wearing my normal clothing. Which means she might get upset that I don't look all wholesome or something. But we are wearing Santa hats. I was wondering if those would even fit over my fake hair? Heh, I guess we will sure find out. I'm taking an umbrella tomarrow.. That is for sure.

Last night I stayed the night with Garrett. He's not going to school anymore, so I'll get to see him a lot more. Between both of our work scedules that is. I think I get to work with Rachel tomarrow by the way - Yea! Anyhow, I'm going to stay at my hunny bunniest head's house probably Monday and Tuesday night. But I have to work Tuesday. (And Thursday, Friday and Saturday.) But, I wanna spend some more time with him.

Well, I had better get going.. I forgot that I told Ross I would have his Marilyn Manson video tape done today. That's three freaking tapes. So what is that? Like 5 hours or more??? Grr.. Oh well, he better be damned greatful. I did offer to make it, I'm just saying, he better be greatful! LOL... Well, bye bye.. 

P.s. Where the hell has Crystal been??? Does anybody know?

"event","Hey there. Right now I am just sitting here and downloading some music. I have 195 songs now. In less then 3 days. DSL rocks my socks. Most of the songs, at least 100 are Dayna's. I am supposed to make her some cds tonight. That is if she ever comes over! I can't get a hold of her. She was going to stay the night. I'll be kind of mad if she doesn't come over. Since I could have made other plans, like with Garrett or stayed at Trudy's house or something.

Speaking of Trudy, I went over there today for a few minutes. I had to pick up some mail, luckily I did, I got a Goth Auctions payment for the gunmetal gray legwarmers that I bought from Crimson Empress Clothing (IE: Countessa). I also borrowed Trudy's VCR so I could make Ross a copy of those Manson movies I am gonna get from Garrett tomarrow. And apparently a pair of my pinstriped Tripp bondage pants were over there still. I don't really like them much, that is probably why I didn't notice them not being here. Heh.

It was so sad when I went to Trudy's. Gypsy and Coal were so excited to see me, and I couldn't stay there to play with them b/c Grandma was in a hurry. (She went to a funeral and church today, so she wanted to come home and relax.) Gypsy was ""Awwoooo-ing"". It was so cute. Then Coal was jumping all around like a retard, what's new though, right? Then when I started to walk out the door Gypsy made the saddest freaking face I have seen. And she just sat there and stared at me walking out the door. Poor baby. When I go over there Sunday, I will have to hold her all day. She will like it. Poor poor pookies! (I didn't even see Princess, she was sleeping in the room with Marda.)

I just ate a really really black toasted grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't that bad though. Then grandma got mad at me b/c she said I always pour a huge glass of milk and leave like an inch and a half at the bottom every time. Yeah I know it's true, but it doesn't matter how much milk I pour, I always leave that much at the bottom. So it seems? It's probalby some strange psychological thingy? Who knows? Milk's weird anyways.

I should probably go work on making my room look clean and lived in today. Grr.. It's all cold up there. So, I'll have to turn my heater on for like an hour and a half. Even though I told my grandma I would only leave it on like ten minutes. I'll see how high her next bill is, and then I will maybe not leave it on so long. I can't help it, I hate cold. It's er um, cold. Heh heh.

Welly wellly, I guess I am going to go now, I would have waited to write on here later, but hopefully Dayna will be here and I am sure she wouldn't want to sit here and watch my type... Maybe? Heh, yeah, right. So bye bye!

Mainly, the whole time I was there it was just me and Ross, because I got there at six o'clock and Rhain and RVI left at seven. Rhain gave me her number, we are probably going to hang out sometime. I wanna hang out with Rachel too, but I don't have her number yet! Grr... Heh. Yeah anyways.. Me and Ross closed. He got mad and threw the stapeler at the ground really hard and it ""exploded"" all over the place. It was pretty funny, since, he wasn't mad at me... LOL...

I said I was going to save my money and everything until I found out about who my secret santa was going to be and so on.. But this girl at Hot Topic so kindly pointed out that the last two black with red star dresses (a small and a medium) were on sale for $18 something.. 98 cents? Anyway! She bought the small, so no duh I had to buy the medium... LOL... I also bought my cousin Chris a package of ""Spidey snacks."" (Shortbread spiderman shaped cookies.) I also got him a Mario Brothers button and I got my step-sister Dayna a Good Charlotte sticker she wanted. The riot girl one one black with pink writing...

I am hoping that I get the money for my ""bigger"" auctions soon. IE: My Twiggy type dreads ($39.00) and my 99.9% Super Low Fat Cat suit... Wait, that one was $39.00, the dreads were probably like $40.00 bucks then.. Well... I wanna get Rachel those shoes from work, and I think they will be like $26.00 after my 40% discount. Also, I wanna get Garrett the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac comic book collection, in the actual book... Instead of buying them all seperate. It's way cheaper and saves space. If I would have known they were going to come out with that I wouldn't have ever bought any of the comics!!! I only have issues #4,5,6... But, I might as well just finish and buy #'s 1,2,3, and 7. I almost did today. But, then I won't have any cash left!!! (&#($*#(*^@(&# <--- Me cussing.. Heh.

This live journal makes me neglect my regular journal! Maybe I will just print out the pages and glue them into my real journal. I at least type hell of a lot faster then I write, I think? And I can write pretty gosh darned fast I tell ya! Though, I would probably not post things that were way private in here, but write them in my journal? But, I am pretty open, so who the hell knows!?

I just noticed that I rant a lot about money. Oh well. Money is a huge topic in everyones life. It can't be helped. You can't even go pee without money anymore. So it seems. Well, when I went to San Fransisco one time there are these bathrooms you have to pay for to use on the streets, so I guess that was a true statement after all!!!

HMM... So Crystal came over today. Me and Grandma and poopy faced Nicole picked her up from Chemeketa. (School.) At 1:30 PM in the front where the busses go. Then we all went to the bank and cashed some of my money orders, then to the Post Office. Where the line was ridiculously long, damn holiday season, and someone smelt funny. So, Me and Crystal got Mike & Ikes from a machine while we waited in line. That will be the last time I have to work with gothicvampire from goth auctions. And no offense, but I can't put up with that shit. Anyhow, then we went to Trudy's house, but no one was there... But I still had my key (which she told me tonight to just hold on to), so I went in and got my deoderant I forgot over there and my toothpaste. I tried to find my mail, but to no avail.. Apparently they put it in a bag and it was some thing from some girl in Medford Oregon. I can't think of who that would be, but anyhow!

So after that Crystal and I came back to my Grandma's house. Er um, my house now.... (I am talking to Mike Anderson on AIM now, so bare with me here.) Heh, I called Mel, Melly Belly... LOL.. Anyhow, back to my story... We just hung out and talked to Andrew on the phone, showed her my computer... Um, showed her my room.. And we played with the rat and ate jalapenio chips! MMM...

"event","Hey there. I was on Goth Auctions sifting through recent posts on the forums... And, I was reading about Live Journal, right? So, I ask for a LJ code. Siniminika was such a sweetheart and gave me a code. Well I went to create an account and apparently my old one from forever ago still existed! But, all of my old journal entries were deleted... Grrr... Oh well. At least someone else might be able to use that code and I can still use this! 

So anyhow... I was going to go to Garrett's house tonight. But I am too tired and I still don't know where the right bus stop is and it's freezing anyhow. Also, I am still unpacking and whatnot. It's okay though, he isn't upset, b/c he realized that he had a big online quiz to do for school. And, school's over on Wednesday. So, it will be good for him to get it all done. But, I am going to go over there early on Thursday, so we can hang out and of course I will stay the night.

Speaking of Garrett, he said he had went to Hot Topic today. And met Chris, Rachel and Andrew. He said they are all nice. I'm hoping to get to know Rachel better. She said that we should go see the movie ""They"" together sometime soon. So, I'll have to ask her about that. Garrett said that Andrew's actually cool, lol... Good! I'm getting to know Andrew better now too, especially since Crystal has an uber crush on him. But not only that, I just think he's way cool. For god's sakes, he likes KMFDM, scratches and wears goggles. Duh, I'm going to be his friend. So hopefully shit between him and Crystal works out or whatever. I guess he's having a party on the 21st or something. So, Crystal and I are going to go.

I wanna get so much crap right now on GO, but I can't afford it. I tried to download the Operation Beat Box cd, but there is only like 4 of the songs on KaZaa. Sooo... I'll either have to somehow find all of the songs, or make a trade or buy it! LOL.. Then Redwitche is auctioning off some of the Hollywood Geisha line. MMM... If only I could complete my collection!!! Maybe if my auctions pick up a bit, I can afford some things... Heh, as if I don't have enough debt... Damn obsessions! Hee hee.

Speaking of auctions once again (This time being Ebay), Mystcat e-mailed me back to ease my paranoia on the long ""Skunk Rock"" Lip Service jacket/coat. She said she hasn't gotten the payment yet, which I pretty much figured, but I still had to e-mail her. She has great feedback and is a super sweetie, but I can't help it. $128.50 is a lot of money not to worry about! Even though Garrett paid $100.00 losing it would suck so hardcore! The reason he paid so much is because it is going to be one of my X-mas presants. And, I told him it was only going to be $100.00... But, I couldn't dare lose that auction!!! I would have to be crazy!

My dad and sister came to my Grandma's today... I left my Ragdoll choppy clip in falls in a box in the back seat of his pick up. They are getting so much thinner looking... :*( I will be so sad the day those falls die! They were my first real pair of synth hair! And they are absolutely gorgeous! If they get ruined I am going to get another pair in the exact style and colors! I ended up buying some dreads from hairexperiments... But they looked yucky on me. I don't think the red went well with me... Though when my hair was magenta and hot hot pink it looked cute.. Oh well. I think I will just spend the $80.00 and get some back combed clip in dreads from ragdolly.net.. Heh, at least she does awesome work, and they will be clip in!!! Right on! Also from Ragdoll I wanted to order some ""Postal"" goggles and turqoise and green lip stick.. And eventually some of those spiked purses/bags and some boots!!! With the cyber removeable panels!!! Oh hell yeah!!!

I only have like $25 bucks left, well after I ship out my auctions I will have $25.00 left. That sucks b/c I still need to buy Crystal a My Little Pony purse and a few other things. And I have to get my sister Nicole a cell phone cover... Garrett some jelly bracelets... Rachel those shoes, #36, size 8... Hee hee... Let's see. I owe pryncessblu on goth auctions $15.75... Crystal I owe $20.00. And I want to get a pair of vinyl 5"" buckle stillettos from this catalogue... Oh and lastly, but probably not least, I have to have cash for the ""Hot Topic Family Dinner"" thing we are having. Also, we are doing a Secret Santa Swap thing, so I'll have to have money for that.... 

Anyhow, I had better get going now, I have to go unpack the rest of the stuff... Dust and clean everything, vacume... Then I have to take a bath... And if I have any more time left I am sure there is some other things that need to be done. Like maybe packaging up some more of my auctions before tomarrow!!!

So, bye bye!

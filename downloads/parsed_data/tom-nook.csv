"event","Sometimes I get sad.  But through careful meditation there is only one way you can really tell.  By holding a piece of paper, or your hand, just under my nose.  It will look like there is a water bottle stuck in my head and someone is holding a flashlight up to it on the other side.  Sometimes i get mad.  Or used to anyway.  Now if you hold your hand up to my ear it'll feel like a furnace is deep inside my head.  I dont know where my emotions went.  The bumper sticker or my car says ""I LOVE MY WIFE"".  Only the LOVE part is actually a red heart.  I dont put gas in that car anymore.  I asked my wife to marry me on top of a mountain.  Every once and a while i go up to the top and ask the mountain where my wife went.  It keeps saying that she was struck by lightning.  I dont think it understands that I already know that, I just want to know where she WENT.  I keep having this dream that I'm driving in that car with no gas, and going pretty fast.  All of the sudden a dog jumps out in front of the car and I hit it.  I stop and get out.  When i look at the dog, its all bloody and it just looks up and says ""Now you're all alone"".  When i wake up there is water all over the place, and my car is still where i left it, and the mountain still does'nt answer me."

"event","Isn't this a familiar sight.  Two men outside of a bar prepared to fight.  Their veins coursing with alcohol, their bodys fearing each others fists.  Its too bad really, if they got to know each other better they might learn how much they have in common.  Their shoe size for instance.  They both wear a size 11 1/2.  Its strange that they cant get along, because this very instant out in the parking lot, their cars are having a friendly conversation about what if feels like to get an oil change.  Boy will it be awkward later when the cars learn what their owners have done.  BAM.  The first punch is delived.  Some blood hits the gravel in the same spot where two squirrels looked up and saw a sunbeam earlier this morning.  Boy did that brighter their day.  No pun intended.  A drunken counter atteack ensues.  The receiver staggers backwards stepping on an anthill that was just finished yesterday.  It took 7 monthes planning, and 2 more monthes of paperwork alone.  Keep right on fighting fellas, im sure itll all make sense at some point."

"event","Im going to start by telling you right off that the following is a dream.  Id rather not have this be one of those stories you start to read where it eventually dawns on you that this is a dream.  Although i think from the content, it would be fairly obvious.  It starts with me, whoever i am, walking through a dimly lit crumbling city.  Its a strange night out, and when i look up, the sky seems to be tearing in two.  There are red streaks of clouds that go from one end of the horizon to the other.  Upon closer inspection i realize that the moon has begun to crack and peel, like a head of garlic.  Its pieces fall to earth igniting on contact, leaving a trail of ashes.  As i walk along a forboding feeling overtakes me, and i feel the urge to slip into the nearest building, just so i dont have to look at the sky any longer.  I find a place with no doors, welcoming enough.  The inside is filled with an irritating light, that doesnt offer much more comfort.  Its a bright dusty red color, and causes me to squint.  Once my eyes adjust i realize that ive somehow entered a strip club by accident.  Ive never been in one of these places before, so the embarrassment begins to creep up my face.  After checking to see if i recognize anyone in the bar, i sit in a stool and take a look at the women.  Only... they arent women at all, they are flames dancing and changing colors.  I watch as one flame quickly changes size, and goes from purple to a light green.  Just when im about to lose it, a girl sits next to me and hands me a drink.  A perfectly normal girl, and a perfectly normal drink.  Thank god.  Without saying anything i drink about half the amber liquid and make eye-contact for the first time.  She smiles, but seems somewhat muffled, as if shes afraid of what is about to happen.  
""Hello..""  Im surprised to hear myself talk, it feels like its been a while.  Sounded more normal than i thought....
""Hi.  Strange night huh?""  She adjusts herself in the chair, and puts her elbows up on the counter.  
""You could say so... i dunno why but it feels very sureal and.. dangerous.  But i guess thats silly.""  I laugh and take another sip.
""Hey, worst that happens is you die right?""  She laughs and winks at me.  ""But that wouldnt be so bad huh.  Depening on what you think of course..."" Is she prying? 
""Well i never really thought about... what happens you know?  I figued whatever it is cant be so bad.""  i usually dislike spiritual talks but at this point id talk about anything just to move the air in my lungs.  I finish off the drink, and she seems to be watching me do so.  She smiles and takes the glass from me.  The room becomes white, and other than the stool i was  sitting on all evidence of the reality i was just in has vinished.  
""You wont wake up from this dream""  She looks at me as seriously as her face will allow.  ""Im afriad that you will die very shortly.  Although this is a dream, i assure you its the truth.""  She looks down as a pained expression passes over her face.
""Some job you have huh, telling people that they are going to die.  That cant be fun.  Seems like youd get used to it though.""  Im fairly calm not sure if its true or not at this point.  I begin to notice the dream getting a little fuzzier though.  details become dulled and white. 
""You would think so wouldnt you...""  Thats the last i hear from her as i feel myself fall off the stool backwards.  Where am i now?  Not sure really but... im doing just fine."

"event","The other day i received quite a scare on my way to work.  I have this unspoken bond with a gopher who happens to live near the on-ramp to 9 north.  I see him from time to time while going to work, and he truly brightens my day.  He must be rahter smart to never run out into traffic, or so i had thought.  The other day i saw what was obviously a gopher slumped on its side quite dead near the same spot.  I wasnt sure how to react at the time.  I never really am when it comes to the death of an animal.  I know to them its not such a big deal, unlike us they seem to accept both aspects of life.  But the way he died seems so unfair.  It surely wasn't a fair fight.  I tired to put it out of my mind as best i could.  Nothing could really be changed, no matter how much i thought about it.  The next day i was driving to work (again) when who should i happen to see, but the gopher again.  I couldnt help but smile and slow down wrecklessly to watch him eat grass.  He looked up at me as if to say ""Dont worry, we dont really die, were here forever.""  As i continued up to the highway, still in a state of awe, i noticed that the corpse of whatever i saw earlier had vanished.  Is this truly a case of invincible gopher?  In this announcers opinion, almost certainly so."

"event","So on the radio tonight I heard people talking about this Mexican show  'Infarto' which is translated to ""hear attack"" I do believe.  It's basically a show like Punk'd from Mexico where they take the pranks way, way too far. Like if they did this in the USA, there would be lawsuits. Anyways it's pretty entertaining. Plus they don't even show what happens when they tell the people it's a lie. It's incredible. I HIGHLY recommend you watch an episode or two. They're all on youtube. Some of them even freaked me out a little bit. Here's a good'n:

<object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/o6sYtaJwTSk""></param><param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/o6sYtaJwTSk"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""425"" height=""350""></embed></object>

And another good'n: 

<object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/n4qH8sIT4wY""></param><param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/n4qH8sIT4wY"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""425"" height=""350""></embed></object>

Actually, you know what? They're all good'ns. Trust me, watch them all.

As I just found, you can see their reactions at the end of the episode. So like part 4 has the reactions from the ones I posted. I can't believe some of the shit they do."

"event","Saturday night was interesting. Went to a party with some friends and had a lot of good times. I just hate it when I see one great friend and another great friend hating each other. hopefully that will all get better. The highlight of the night, I must say, is when I, for the first time of my life, participated in a Roshambo. And won. Took two kicks each but I won. I actually beat two people, one of which never even got to kick me. So to Steven and Nick, thank you for letting me kick you in the balls. I'm sure the running start helped me out. Oh and as a bonus, I got to punch Steven in the face as hard as I wanted."

"event","Life has been interesting lately. Not all in a good way. Won't go in to specifics, but I'm having a bad day today. Last night was fun though. We went to Sharis and ate good food. Sadly, Amy was not working, but we'll get her next time. The wedding is in 2 days. That means I have two days to write a speech. It's okay though, all of my HS speeches were written 15 minutes before class and I got As on most, so 2 days is more than enough. My to do list:

-Get Blue and Pink Suit back from the Scotty.
-Shave... meh.
-Oh shit, go to work!"

"event","Just saw the movie Domino for the first time. I'd have to say it's pretty much amazing. I mean, aside from Keira Knightley being my future wife, it's just a really really good movie. Like, really good. One of my favorites now. If you know me, you know I'm not huge in to action movies. Like die hard type of action. This is the big exception. It was just really well done. Trust me, rent it, borrow it from me, whatever.

Oh, and Sydney is my REAL future wife, (when I'm awake).

Love you."

"event","So today was pretty much the longest day of my life. After 2 hours at work it felt like 6 and by the end of the shift it felt like I had been there for like 24 hours when I was only there for 12. It sucked bigtime. Could have been worse I suppose. I did good as far as caffeine goes. At about midnight I started getting really stressed out, buckled, and had a smoke. Sucky. I totaly regretted it immediately after. I'll get it tomorrow eh. Thanks for all the kind responses to the last post. It makes me feel really supported. Support is really kickass. I'm going to bed now. Being at work for 24 hours today really worse me out. I hope to get up early and go get a new drivers license. That would be good. Also, so it's out there, this is the third Saturday of the month, which means Kell's is on for Saturday night. See you all there. Bueno.

Also, the 4 word rule applies on this post as well."

"event","So my party has been moved. Instead of a cabin at the Flying M, I am now renting 5 cabins (yes, 5) at Champoeg State Park. Because I am too lazy to type everything up, I'll just copy the myspace invitation Sydney sent out.

Party with ben and friends to celebrate his 21st birthday! THEME = Pirates! Have fun and be creative with dressing up~
	
The party is going to take place in 5 cabins at Champoeg State Park, outside of Newberg. Everyone is expected to attend and dress like a pirate, damsel, or wench! We will have plenty of beds and floor space for people to crash on, but be sure to bring blankets because they are not supplied with the cabins. We are only allowed 5 parking spots so please try to car pool with people when you come out to the cabins. We will shuttle people around if we need to.

Beer and hard A will be at the party, but if you want something special, bring your own drinks.

The party is on Saturday December 10th, just few days away, so mark your calanders!! It will probably start around 6, but feel free to show up any time after that.

Here are some directions: From Newberg the park is off 99W, 7 miles E of Newberg. From I-5, take Exit 278 and head west. Follow the signs. For specific directions go to oregonstateparks.org

Ask either ben or I if you have any questions!
See everyone on Saturday!"

"event","I was looking at my shot glasses just now, and they all have charcoal in the bottom. Little flakes of charcoal. This definately means the last drink in each one was 151. This definately means I am awesome.

So I had one of the worst days of my life. Maybe tomorrow will be better, but I'm not gonna hold my breath, partially because I'm still in just as bad a mood, and partially because tomorrow is a day away and I think holding my breath that long would cause me come down with a mild case of... death. (Dr. Robert Kelso)

The weekend was awesome though. With how down a mood I have been in lately, it was good to have friends there to lift my spirits. It probably meant a lot more to me than it did to you. Thank you all though. It cheered me up.

Now I will relax and take a load off with some mac n cheese and more 151. I'm thinking my cat will come hang with me later, but that usually takes till 3 or 4 in the am. She goes and ""catches"" socks and brings them to the bottom of the stairs and howls until someone goes and congratulates her. It's always me. She's so proud of what she caught for us. Most of the time it earns her entry to my room and lots of snuggles. She misses my brother. They were best friends."

It's a wonderful night for me. The red sharpie was used to color an LED that illuminates a plastic ring around my ignition. Instead of an ugly green that does not match the rest of the red lights (gauges and such), I now have a beautiful red light! I'll never miss my ignition again!

Now it is time to watch some Scrubs and try to force myself to fall asleep. I'm getting quite sick of this never seeing anyone ever thing. Kaitl says she may be staying up some nights to hang with me after work. That would be fantastic because I would be around people that arent the 3 guys I work with!"

"event","Another night of being the last one person still awake. It gets me down sometimes. Not really too sure why. I went to Mac about an hour ago for a 2 liter of Dr Pepper. Well worth the trip. It's weird being the last person awake in the whole world. As the night goes on, people stop sending me text messages and people on aim start putting up their away messages one by one. Usually I am left with some sort of project that I eventually give up on, such as a photoshop or some kind of website type thing, and a bottle of Dr Pepper. Flickr is keeping me busy tonight so far. Soon I will turn off the sappy music and put in a movie I've seen a hundred times already and try to sleep. I'm not well at sleeping lately either. I wake up off and on all night. In the morning I wake up, try to go back to sleep, then eventually give up and move 3 feet to my computer, where I waste a good part of my day. Everyone is at work by the time I am awake and everyone is in for the night by the time I get home from work. I then repeat the process of being up late and alone. I don't have much contact with people other than the ones at work through most of my day. I see my dad sometimes at night, and from time to time on her days off, I see my mom in the morning. I hear from people off and on through the day at work, most of whom are responding to text messages or pictures I have sent them out of boredom.

I guess I don't know why I am down so often. I am happy when I am around people but as you can see, that is only on the weekends. It doesn't make sense to me. I have a great girlfriend, my dream car, amazing friends, parents who love me, a brother who I think sometimes means well, and cares for me when there isn't something more important, and a job that pays the bills. I want something more I guess. I don't know what is missing but it feels like something is.

Or maybe it's just the sappy music."

"event","So the concert last night was amazing. Best concert I have seen. Ben Lee was awesome, though his set was short, as openers are. Rufus was good. Very talented guy, but his music just didnt really fit the mood of the show. Ben folds was great. Played mostly classic songs, ""Philosohpy"" ""Underground"" and ""One angry Dwarf a-t-h-s-f"" to name a few of the most exciting ones to hear. I expected a bit more to be said about Elliott Smith when ""Late"" was played, seeing as how Elliott was a Portlander. Either way, 'twas very emotional. Ben throwing his stool at his piano while standing on top of Rufus' piano was great, and his last words being ""FUCK YOU"" was equally awesome. I'd have to say one of the best parts of the show was the 10-ish minute version of ""Bitches aint Shit."" Definately worth the money. We were in the front row and were all leaning ont he stage the whole time, which made being crammed in there for like 5 hours that much easier. Good night."

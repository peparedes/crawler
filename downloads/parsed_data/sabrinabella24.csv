Me and Tabs went to Montana's for supper, then Noel and Evan came. That was fun. We went back to the Broughton's and played Star Wars Monopoly, then I brought Tabs home, and I went back to get Chris and take him to the bar. That kid was looooooaded. He wore the Paulberta shirt, because he's a ""shit disturber"". He managed to talk to this old guy (he told us he was 49) at the Roadhouse for like half an hour. My question was more along the lines of what the hell is a 49 year old doing at a place where 18-22 year olds hang out? Creepy. So we left Roadhouse around 2, went to 2 Guys and a Pizza place, Chris got pizza then we went back to his house and talked in my car til almost 3. It was exciting. Haha. Yeah.</FONT></P>

Friday night, I hung out with Leslie Schmidt and Janay.  We sat in the hot tub and talked for hours on end.  It was nice.  Then we went to the bar in out PJs and wet hair.

Saturday I worked alllllll day.  Sherese came in in her wedding dress.  She looked beautiful.  Then I went home, where Janay called and asked if I wanted to come get drunk in the hot tub.  Of course I went.  Got plastered.  Woop.  Leslie, Chris and Lane came and got us and we went to the Roadhouse and Essies.  Both sucked so we went back in the hot tub.  I slept sooo well.

Yesterday I went to Tabs' house at about 2:30 to watch Love, Actually.  Then she came over for supper, and then her, me and Lisa went and saw 50 First Dates.  Not the best movie ever.  We went back to Tabs house, watched the end of Love, Actually, and started drinking.  Lisa came over and we went to Park Lake and for a spin around the city.  My throat hurt like a you know what.  It felt like there was a golf ball in it.

I went home at like midnight, and was laying in bed, reading, when Chris called.  It was 1:30.  I was like huh?  But we talked for like 15 minutes or so.  I asked him to call me today (meaning tomorrow yesterday) and he said he would, but for some reason he called me at 1:30 this morning too.

Anyways, I gotta go to work.  Have a good one."

"event","Ok so last night was interesting.

Me, Lisa and Leslie were the only people there that came specifically for Evan's band.  The opening band, from Edmonton, sucked.  It made my head hurt.  I called Ashlie from outside the bar because there's no cell phone reception inside apparently, but she didn't answer (:-P).

Anyways, they played really well (MUCH better than Wednesday night) and it was an all around good time.

Then Lisa and I went to Spin.  We hung out with Derek and Nathan for a bit...  Ok, she did...  I was more interested in hanging out with Ryan and Michelle, because frankly, I like them more.  We all danced.  The old creepy GM guy from work...  The really tall freakish one...  Kept asking me to dance.  I was like aaaaaaaah.  Then I saw Noel which was cool.  And then Leslie.  Which was very cool.  And then Chris.  Not so cool.

Jayce called and was like ""Come to the Roadhouse!""  So after Lisa and I did a shot of JD (they spotlighted us!!  Grossest shit ever though) we went.  I hadn't seen Jayce in so long.  I missed him.  At the Roadhouse, Katie was just getting there as we were.  She was like ""Look!  It's Sarah again!""  I said hi and kept walking.

Lisa, Jayce and I made the rounds around the bar and I was in the middle.  Lisa was leading.  She made it past before this guy tried to like molest me in the middle of the place.  He started trying to dance with me and Jayce got so pissed.  He grabbed my hand and shot the guy the NASTIEST look ever.  The guy was scared, I think, which is funny because Jayce is harmless.

Anyways.  I think that's all I have to say.  I gotta go get ready for work now.

P.S. Heidi and Leslie...  Get updating."

Last night was fun.  I went out for supper with Leslie and Janay, then we went and saw Mean Girls.  Tabs called me during the movie saying Kevin decided to stay home and sleep so she wanted to come to the Roadhouse with us.  So me, Tabs, Lisa and Jay went to the Roadhouse.  It was fun.  Melani was there, and so were Derek and Cody.  Jen Critchley.  Katie and Maddy...  Katie and I had a civilized conversation.  Woop woop.

Tonight, Lisa and I are going to Vibes to watch Evan's show.  Mel said she's on alert in case Brandi tries anything...  Just a phonecall away.  Nate and Derek might stop by too *blush*.  I saw Derek today when Lis decided she needed new rollerblades.  I didn't think I liked him that much, but I guess I do.  He gave us the ""rollerblade speach""...  Very cute!!

After we shopped, we went and bugged Derek Mihalik at work.  It was fun.  Muahaha.

Now I'm saying things I swore I'd never say

I used to be so sure
There I was stronger than ever
And here I am blaming the hurt

And if I fall, I will find a way back to my hands
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet again

Here's the song of the moment..  Depressing, but I love it.  It's called If I Fall by Tara MacLean.  Download it, everyone.  Unless you're Leslie Stitt and I sent it to you on MSN.

Ok so Missy and I are going MD shopping this afternoon.  My mom is the hardest person on earth to shop for.  I seriously have no idea what to get her at all.  We were thinking Chicken Soup For The Mother's Soul.  And then like a gift basket of tea, bubble bath...  That kinda stuff.  How does that sound?  Good?  Thought so.

Anyways last night was interesting.  I was loaded.  Sooooooooo loaded.  I felt like a pile of ass this morning to proove it.  I was so sick this morning I thought I was dying.  Alas, it's 1:36 PM and I haven't even showered yet.  Maybe I should do that.

Last night, apparently I was dancing with Ryan Kreeft, which made Christine an unhappy person.  I didn't even recognize him.  I knew I knew him from work so I just said hi and we went and danced.  Then June came over and flipped out on me and was like ""Christine is going to be so pissed"".  Apparently Christine wanted to punch me after that.  When she said that this morning, I just laughed and was like ""yeah that would have been smart...  Tabs would have kicked your ass.""  Tabs is pretty pissed off too.  Like seriously.

Anyways we called Scotty to come get us and he did.  I love Scott.  My parents locked the storm door so I had to drunkenly go in the back door.  That ment climbing over my deck.  Not so smart with my super pink runners on.  I almost broke my neck three times I think.  Then I called Shaw and fixed my internet.  Sweet hey?  I did it when I was drunk!!!!

Yeah that's really all I have to say.  Chris White was at the bar and I was like BYE CHRIS!!!!!  And he just glared at me.  Hahah.  Fucker.  And I told off a Calgary Hell's Angel.  He was like hardcore trying to look down my shirt and I told him to fuck off.  He was like ""do you know who I am?!""  Evidently no, asshole.  Matt Poytress was like ""sorry, my girlfriend is a little drunk right now.""  Tabs wanted to pummel that guys ass too because he kept trying to get with me...  AND HE WAS OLD!!

I saw Nathan too.  No Derek though, which was sad.  He looked really good.  That said, everyone looked really good last night with the amount of alcohol I had in my system.

Anyways off to make friends with my shower as I smell like...  The bar.  Gross.

Love ya!!!

Thanks for the email, Leslie.  It made me giggle.

I ended up going to Essie's with my boys last night.  They played pool while I drank copious amounts of Draft.  Mmmm.  Needless to say, guess who was drunk?  THAT WOULD BE ME.

Chris and all his little followers were there.  I really wish he wouldn't talk to me.  I told him off, then two-stepped with him for like...  Four songs or something like that.  After that I decided I hated him again, and told him that.

Leslie brought me home, and I like died on my floor.

TABATHA IS BACK!!!!!  YAAAAAAY!  She got back from Waterton this afternoon, so we took my sister to the Optometrist's office, then we hung out.  Mean Girls rocks.  It's the funniest movie I've seen in a looooooong time.

Now I'm at home, drinking apple juice and eating Glosette Peanuts.  I need to go to bed, badly.  Work 11-6 tomorrow.  Why does Melissa hate me?

Leslie, call me tomorrow.

I was just planning on sitting on my ass allllll night tonight, doing a lot of nothing.  At all.  But then Lisa decided she was bored and so we went out and had coffee at Denny's.

On Scenic, we saw two cops go like...  Warp speed past us and we were gonna follow them but decided we were tired and came home.

That's really all I have to say...  I close AGAIN tomorrow... WTF.  Apparently Melissa hates me or something.

Oh yeah, and don't let me go to the gym for a loooong time.  I went yesterday and now my abs and legs hurt soooo bad.

Have a good night!

"event","At the urging of Leslie Stitt, I'm updating.  This might not be my DJ, but it's still a journal.

Friday night I got blown off, so Heidi and I went to Andrew's party.  Before that, I went to Scott's house and Michelle and I talked for a while.  She was like ""you can do so much better, he's an ass"" and Ryan got mad at me for going through this again.

Thanks Michelle for making me feel better.

At Andrew's house, I drank an entire bottle of Malibu.  Wow, guess who had issues standing up after that one?  Heidi and I went to Spin, where Chris was with Brandi.  Meagan Van Dorland decided to tell him off or something, so she did, while me, Heidi, Maria and Christine were dancing.  I missed my girls so much.

I got home and called Chris crying...  Yeah...  I think it had to do with the fact that I was drunk and the whole Brett thing.  I spent the entire afternoon crying, then I slept for an hour, then I cried more.  Anyways, Chris came over and I had somewhat of a breakdown and cried, then I got mad at him.  He told me he didn't think us getting back together would work.  No shit, I could have told him that last week.

Last night, me, Tabs, Heidi and Carmen went to Raining Confusion's CD release party.  It was somewhat fun.  I met Leslie there (and he told me to update my DJ, but I decided I liked this one better) and we all hung out.  When Jenae and Tenille got there, we went to The Roadhouse, and then me and Tabs lost everyone else, so we went back to the Starlight.  That place is sooooo...  Creepy?  Yuck.  Anyways.

I got home just after midnight, talked to my Katelyn for a bit, then went to bed, where I stayed until 2 PM when my mom came in and said something like ""shouldn't you maybe get up?""  I grumbled but did.  I mean, it was 2 PM afterall.

Now, Tabatha is in Waterton for three days, and I'm lonely.  Noel told me to have fun.  Tabatha is my fun.  *SIGH*.  Lisa said she'd be my best friend til she gets back...

I think that's about all I have to say.  My mom made Chicken Ciacatorre (sp?), pasta and asparagus for supper.  I'm STOKED.  My nonna is here too.  Woot.

Have a good one!!

Anyways, it's been a long three days.  I miss Brett so much.  It's hard for me to see everyone around me crying and being sad because I want to be happy...  He wouldn't want us to sit and cry for him.  He'd want us to go out and get drunk and toast him every hour.

His funeral is on Friday, and Chris said he'd come.  What a doll.

Chris and I are going on a ""date"" Friday night too.  He's taking me to Spin and letting me get drunk.  Yay.  Wish me luck and Ash, please remind me not to do anything STUPID while I'm with him...

Ummm, that's all really.  My aunt, uncle and cousins got here, and so therefore, I have a splitting headache.  Goody.  It won't go til I get to work tomorrow, then it will come back til they leave on Monday.

My aunt got mad at me for having to work Sunday.  She can go fist a midget, then call Melissa and Melissa can tell her off.

Me and Tabs are going to church with my family this afternoon.  Woop woop.  Parrrrrtay!  My mom and I got into an arguement over religion like ten minutes ago.  I told her I didn't know what I believed and she got mad.  Go.  To.  Hell.

Yeah, I gotta go check in on SOTR, then dry my hair.

So my mom and I were at Save On, getting ready for auntie Loly when my cell rings, my mom answered it because I was wandering the candy aisle, she finds me and it's Melissa.

""Sherese's car broke down, still want the shift?""  I look at the clock and it's 1.  I told her there was no way I'd be there for 1:30 and agreed to come for 2:30-6:30.

Ooookies.  So I get there at 2:15 with Steph telling me to sign in as soon as I can (2:23).  It's lined up down the aisles.  Soooooo busy.  I wanted to run away crying, screaming, whatever.  I spent four hours straight on my till.  I'm wiped.

Anyways, I'm going golfing with Leslie tomorrow.  Haha that will be a gong show.  Me and Leslie?  BAHAHA.

Emo makes me laugh.  Evan has this whole ""emo boy"" image he tries to uphold.  He's had it ever since he and Katelyn broke up.  Sometimes I wish he and Katelyn were still together, because I love Evan more than, and Evan and Kates were so cute together...

Jessica was working.  She was there 11-6, so I had to deal with her for two hours.  I was supposed to be on till 4, but of course it was broken (the damn scanner blew up), so they moved me to 2, next to Chantele.  Not too bad.  Jeff (the GM manager) bent over and OMFG ASS CRACK MUCH?  Jeff is a biiiiig guy...  I'd say pushing 350 or 400...  Not something I wanted to see.  I turned around and looked at Chan with this disgusted look on my face.  She laughed and was like:

""Jeff, Sarah is enjoying the look of your ass right now.""  I was sooooo embarrassed.  I wanted to die.

I got over that, Todd took Chan off, and then Chan sprayed my butt with the green cleaner.  It was soooo cold and soooo wet and I was rediculously uncomfortable for an hour after that.

Then it go busy.  Monster busy.  God damnit.  I was supposed to take New Girl Diana out to show her carts and bullers, and then show her crates, but I didn't get off my till for two hours.  Needless to say, Todd did carts, but then I made Kara clean tills while I showed Diana crates.  Then we did put aways (mostly because it took Diana an hour to clean three tills and we didn't have time for her to piss around doing another one...)

I went to Tabatha's house after.  We hung out.  Went to Boston Pizza with Tynan and Winston (uggggh I HATE Tynan).  That was funny.  Tynan choaked on a wing when I was like ""YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FISTING ME!""  Hello?  My catch phrase?  He felt it necessary to explain what that ment, like I was some dumbass.  Riiight Tynan, whatever you say.

Came home.  That's it.  I'm going to write a story.  Good night!

I talked to Kate last night, went to bed at like 2 AM (ack) and woke up at noon.  It was nice being able to sleep that long.

I made perogies for lunch...  They're really good with garlic chip dip, oddly enough.  I'm weird, I know.  I'm drinking peppermint tea and talking to Emily and Craig now.  Craig is telling me that he and Lysa were exactly like me and Chris were, so he's giving me advice.  Hurray for her.

Me and Em just had a talk about boobs.  Haha.  I love Em.

I'm watching Dr. Phil right now, it's about crazy moms, and then I'm going to shower and get ready for work.  Woop woop.  Still bitter about closing...

What's up all?  I made this account for all my Rainbow girls, and your entries will go in the section marked ""Rainbow Rants"" because none of my friends have Live Journals.  Dead Journals, are another story.

This place will be happy happy, not all the melodrama that goes on at DJ.

Anyways, I woke up at 9 this morning, and had to work at 11.  The first bit sucked.  It was rediculously busy.  Leslie was there, and we were gonna go for a walk tonight, but it got really really windy.  Apparently there's a Wind Warning out now.  At 1, Leslie got sick of training the new girl, so Kristi came and watched me ring stuff through.  HOW FUN HEY??  Haha.  She said it was better than putting the same twenty things through in training mode.

At about 2, Tracey decided to act like the Assistant Supervisor and started training Kristi more, but I'd already taught her everything she didn't know, so at 4, Kristi came back to watching me, while Tracey trained the other new girl, Diana.  Kristi is nice.  We both used to work together, and didn't even know it.

I worked til 6, then came home.  Winston called me all proud of himself for spending $300 at the mall.  He told me he looked hot now and I laughed.  I love that kid.  I went and got gas, and drove home.  At the lights by my house, I got in a staring match with Katie.  It was kinda funny.  Ate dinner, and plopped myself in front of the computer.  I talked to Ashlie and Noel for two and a half hours, then went and had some tea, and now I'm talking to Tabatha, waiting for Katelyn to come on.

I can't believe Katelyn is leaving me!!  I'm so sad.  She's movie to PEI for University.  I can't believe she's going.  Gah.  We're going to Calgary and shopping at IKEA in June, then we're going to be ""European heiresses"" at the zoo.  The Calgary Zoo rocks my socks, and I can't wait to go.  I haven't been for so long.  We were going to ask Noel and some of his friends to come with us and be our ""body guards"" or something, but we decided we were gonna make it a girls day out.  Just the two of us before she leaves for good.

I might move out there when I graduate from college.  We'll see.

It's really weird the things we'd do for the people we love, isn't it?  Guys specifically.  If I'd never met Andrew, I'd be living in Edmonton with my dad right now.  Isn't that crazy?  I fell in love with him (or what I thought was love at the age of 15...) and after begging my mom to let me move, decided I had to stay here.  I just *HAD* to.  I loved him.  We talked about it the other day and he said if we could go back in time, he'd do it all differently and he and I would probably still be together.  He told me he loves me too.  Yay.

I work 4-9 tomorrow.  What the hell is that?  I never close.  Ever.  And so help me god if I have to close with Jessica I'm going to snap.  I hate her!!!!!!  At least Steph is closing, so it won't be too bad.  When I told her I was closing she was like ""what was Melissa on when she made the schedual?""  But since there will probably be another new girl closing, she told me I could train if I wanted, because it makes her job easier.

Anyways, I think that's enough babbling out of me.  Have a good night!!

so now that thats clear, i fear ill spread myself to thin.
If i too many small parts of myself to different guys then i will never be the most important girl to one guy. does that make sense? im nothing unless im the most important to at least one person. 
who am i if im just number two or three or a hot fuck to a couple of guys...nobody
i fear the point when i'm nothing to no one.
i fear that ill never be ok enough with myself to be ok with being nothing to no one but myself
i'm pretty sure ill always be this pathetic way..as sad as it is i know its true
why do i strive more than anything to be the prettiest girl.
why do i feel that need?
do other girls feel that?
Ben has another slice now.  i saw it on facebook, so i was feeling like i was going to fall to pieces so i called Greg and talked to him for almost a half an hour. i love that family.they are a part of me weather i like it or not. 
why cant life be boring and simple? i want to cry more than anything right now and i couldn't quite tell you the cause. im at an expensive school i don't have to work my only obligation is going to a few classes a week and asking my hard working father for money when i need it.
rough life huh?
 i know I'm worthless. you don't have to tell me.
I'm sitting alone getting drunk by myself, that could be a problem.
how do i fix myself 
I've learned a lot and i think i should be able to do it by now
right?
i hate myself more than anyone else on this planet
how could that be, when we all create"

"event","i think i may have figured out a small part of the big problem a second ago.
I'm absolutely aware of my boy problem situation, whatever you may call it.
but when trying to analyze why i came to a conclusion.
so the scenario is i went to a party with the guys and girls on the soccer team last Saturday or Friday or something. Jo (a girl) is one of our captains. shes in good shape, decent face but a bit of acne and not trying to be horrible but shes nothing special besides her bubbly and brilliant personality.
So the other day she informs me that she is interested in one of the boys that was at the party. his name is Jackson he doesn't go to our school hes a hard core runner, tall skinny fluffy hair, hes nothing special either. Point of the story is i never gave him a second glance until Jo mentioned and then all the sudden during our conditioning i spent the whole time checking him out to see if he may glance and me...why in my head i wanted to make sure that i was on his radar rather than Jo. do i want him? no would i give him the time of day if he seemed interested..most likely not. so why waste my energy?
Well I concluded if he showed interest in me rather than Jo that means that i must be prettier than Jo. 
Is that the saddest thing  you've ever herd?
Pathetic
I need help, the funny thing is Ive been getting intensive help for over 10 years of my life. days when a boy doesn't give me the attention that i want or feel i deserve, I'm absolutely crushed. that only most of the time has the ability to almost completely ruin my day.how does one fix that? know the root of my  problem is my shotty self esteem. Ive already got myself into a little pickle. oh and take a wild guess on what is regarding..
boys..ding ding ding
there was this hideous boy named Michael that is random fuck buddies with this girl on my floor Caroline that i was pretty close with. What i took from there ""relationship"" was he would get blackout drunk and wake up in her bed. she was interested in him but not enough to pursue it, oh and don't let me forget to mention that she is currently sleeping with another guy that lives in Killington that we met at a show a few weeks ago. So i was acting overly flirty with Michael since i met him. I thought it was good old friendly fun flirting. Hes absolutely hilarious. So he didn't take it as friendly flirting. One drunken night we fool around no sex involved. Word gets out. Caroline isn't happy. he drunkenly ends up in my room again and then one drunken night i end up in his room there are many details in between but not enough time. end of story is i dropped him and he kind of dropped me because i kept kicking him out of my room. Me and Caroline talk i know shes not pleased with me and i don't blame her but we pretty much squash it.at least i thought we did. so I'm sitting in my room the other night doing homework and i can literally hear her talking shit about me to the girl across the hall. and that first night with Michael i made out with the girl across the halls bf too. we were both shitty drunk. i don't think anyone knows about that so much but they do know we were flirting hardcore. Long story short for the second time i fucked up pretty bad.but nobody likes hearing people talk shit about them. Ha somebody just told me he went home with an admission counselor last night after the pub and then puked all over himself at her house. that's funny shit. Anyways further proving another fact..
this is fucking college, and its a hippie college at that. Lots of sex drugs and grateful dead :) i couldn't be happier.
I feel like I've been keeping it in my pants for the most part at least out of the pants of drama. I'm glad my drunken inner skank hasn't ruined my reputation so much thus far. i think it was the first or second week i got pretty shitfaced on pub night and slept with Giancarlos, very cute but dump as a rock, rock climbing adventure rec major boy and from what i remember it wasn't great so we are still good buddies, no awkwardness i love it! Then a few weeks later some cool alumni guys were back visiting and i slept with one of them, Gram. I was white girl wasted for sure just remember i was really loud but i don't have to see him ever again. which is good, he was kinda cute but kinda a dick.
So everybody out here (maybe not everybody) but some people are really into this local band called Twiddle we made friends coincidentally with some of there friends, one of which i though was really cute and was sorta macin on but then when his ex showed up at the bar i was over it, i then get pursued by the basest of Twiddle his name is Zednek pronounced Sten ick(weird i know) and he takes me home and yeah, to summerize it happened again and then i went over two nights ago and yeah;) bottom line is he is a great fuckin guy. So sweet such good manners, rubs me down, caring and not a slime bucket. i know what your thinking but really a genuinely great guy. He sent me a text on Sunday saying something along the lines of ""hey we are both free spirits but i way into you and i want to please you like youve been pleasing me, i want to taste your pulse, then he said listen i can handle rejection so just say give it to me"" so yeah cool guy in a great band, pretty great sex and the best part of all of it is I am SO damn comfortable with him. we can cuddle talk for hours and laugh. Good shit. Not fully on board but def a good time and i hope that it continues, i think..i just refuse to put myself in any type of positing where i can get hurt ya know?
OK so i'm not done yet. ive saved the best for last. Brian, my athletic trainer. He is a fucking stud for sure. he is a big beautiful hunk of man. I know what your thinking but hes younger than i am hes 22. We flirted pretty hardcore there for awhile then I told him that i was going to a bar in the town over where he went to school and he was like no way you cant go there im going there tonight. to summarize again he takes me home i was a little shwastey pants so i dont remember how the night played out but im like 94% sure we didn't have sex. We get along really well. hes got a great sense of humor. we have hung out one other time outside of school at that bar and we talked for a little bit but i didn't go home with him. He invited me to come make soup with him the other night. I uber regret not going. i was trying to play the game and now im worried that i lost my chance. but it is what it is. I feel really comfortable around him as well. But one thing..he's a good old boy. grew up on a farm, loves country music and loooves his big ford truck. So not Meghan but he is so damn finee! im not sure if im after the chase, the challenge. im not quite sure, he is pretty hard to read im almost positive that hes pretty into me but then he does some things that make me not so sure. the night that i didnt go home with him i told him that i liked him..wtf i know totally not meghan style but im pretty sure he gave me no positive nor negative response. A day or two later i apologized and said that i hope i didn't make him uncomfortable and he said there was no need for that and later that day text-ed me for the first time and then we finally had each others numbers.. no idea how he got my number probably looked in records. Cute shit either way. dont know how to deal with in though, a good part of me is telling me that this is a horrible idea, but i love a challenge and i wanna know what ill do with him once i have him. if i get him..we shall see. it will def be awkward if it carries on and goes bad somehow.
I like boys way to much but look at that technically have only slept with one Green Mountain student so far so 
FUCK YESH i'll take it"

"event","A lot has happened since we last spoke.
but not much has changed.
My lease was up. I decided to move to Vermont.
Well that didn't quite go as planned. My aunt and uncle that i was going to stay with are absolutely and completely neurotic. Marlboro was way crunchier than i think i am able to handle. Bottom line I lasted about 38 hours in VT and i packed my shit back into the Protege and headed back to West Chester. 
Complete and utter FAIL
Oh yeah and the biggest part of this whole equation..I wasn't excepted, but i wasn't denied either. The answer i got was basically they were leaning towards not accepting me but we could negotiate i would have to talk to another adviser to see where i would be placed academically. But most likely even though i would be transferring as almost a senior they would want me to come in as a sophomore.
Not gonna happen.
So I'm crushed and now crossing my fingers that Green Mountain accepts me. If not my dreams are shot. I'm stuck going to West Chester which i just applied to or Ohio State and please just fucking shoot me if i go back to Ohio.I will fall into the same shit. 
Ben,Blackouts and Boredom.
I will admit that being here for a little over a month now has made me realize that my life wasn't nearly as bad i as made it out to be. I love being independent, didn't despise my mediocre job, liked being with Pat and enjoyed my busy day to day routine. 
Some of the large negatives of staying in Ohio is that my sister and the way my parents treat my sister absolutely drive me up a fucking wall. two I clearly have a obsession with Ben that only distance can break. I literally can not stay away from that kid if my life depended on it. I honestly think that if someone told me if you ever see or contact him again someone in your family will die. I don't know if i would be strong enough to stay away. It is my biggest downfall, it is a disease that i fear i will never find the cure for. I felt trapped in Ohio, even though i wasn't living the same drug addicted, crazy binge drinking, sexually promiscuous lifestyle i was in the same area that it all occurred, ever so often running into old drug buddies from high school, or being in room knowing you've slept with three guys just in that general vicinity.
Its Repulsive.
I needed to get out. But every step i take i wonder if I'm taking it in the right direction. Then i think any direction is better than staying in Ohio.  I feel like i'm drifting through life on a cloud. ever so slowly. I need a job. i have an interview tomorrow. Do i want to stay here? the whole point of leaving was to go somewhere crunchy Vermont. I'm taking it one day at a time but its going so slowly and quite frankly nothing seems right. I don't want to go home, i cant live with Jan and Jason i don't have enough money(or balls) to go anywhere and start doing my own thing. It seems like a disaster. Like a simple math equation that for some reason i just cant find the answer to. never ending and unsolvable. I revert back the the reassuring phrase ""everything happens for a reason.""
so here i am."

 Pats in Europe. i have finals this week. its looking like its going to be two A's and a B in math....ill take it.
 i leave for Vermont on sunday. hopefully this marlboro school is everything ive made it out to be. i want out i dont want this anymore these constant reminders of the person i used to be, old friends, old places, seeing my sister struggle and hang out with the same kind of slimy people i used to hang out with. seeing my parents deal with it so poorly. i want something new.
 im not scared or nervous just one more quarter at this shitty community college and then i get my associates and my lease is up and im no longer obligated to stay here.
 there is not one string holding me here i can go where i please and do as i please. dont quite know the plan yet but the Appalachian Trail is def getting worked in there somewhere.
ill figure it out. one day at a time, one day at a time."

"event","the tears well up in my eyes
sayde paces and pants waiting for me to pay attention to her
and my heart hurts to much to move 
the senses fail song one eight seven plays and it describes every emotion
my favorite verse is
 ""you ripped my heart out, you tore my eyes out
 now your gonna pay, i'll stab you one time
 i'll eat your heart out so you feel my pain
 dont you know that i always see you in all of my dreams?""
in fucking tense i love it.
wow so it doesnt hurt as bad now but sometimes i have this intense pain like when you get a cramp in your foot and you just cant move like that but this pain flushes through my brain all the goodness that is within him that i love more than anything washes over me like a great high but he not him anymore things aren't the same he's not with me he wont even answer the phone when i call he wont be here not like it was...or was it i dont even know anymore do i even know what im chasing anymore i wasnt happy im pretty sure i wasnt all i can think of is him telling me he wasnt oh that pain in my chest my brain my entire body i cant smoke it out.
i cant drink it out and even if i do its there when i wake up 
am i chasing whatever it was i used to feel? 
just feeling really with someone and i still think that we understand one another 
i cry and try to leak the pain out but it wont go
 i know he doesnt feel like this.
he wouldn't be able to handle it
i can barely stand it right now 
no he doesn't know me 
i dont think anyone know this feeling 
what ive been through yeah others have been there 
done the things i have
the drugs 
the rehab
the jail time
the sex 
the hurt 
the experiences 
their all your own, its different to everyone. i don't know if he still cries for my as i do for him i assume not
i just hope my heads fucked up and its not really him that i miss is some underlying thing that i haven't revealed myself to.
ha this probably sounds crazy im not even sure its just what goes through my head. do you think ill be able to do it ever? be sane. be able to be clear minded im not sure but when i reach it im sure ill just know. i like to i want to find a nice cabin. like jans cabin live off the land, no cable or internet to fog my thoughts be completely content me and sayde and muffin do things that actually make you feel great grow and hike and swim kayak whatever i want 
after that then i can look for a guy
a guy with pure intentions
i can see it now."

"event","i find it interesting how i sporadically decide to write in here...
is it because I'm waiting for someone to maybe, eventually respond or give me some life changing feedback that I've never herd before.
is it because i don't have anyone else to talk to or simply don't want any overbearing or bullshit feedback and i just need to get all this emotion inside of me out one way or another...
im not quite sure but I'm going to go with option three..sure
my head hurts..from crying? from mom yelling? not sure but im pretty sure i had it before all this nonsense of an evening
all i know is that this glass of wine and bowl is not helping one bit 
pat asked if i wanted to be his girlfriend ""officially"" last night after this amazing vacation we had together with all of our friends if would just be wrong to say no and lets just be honest its been a long time coming now so i said yes we went home from the bonfire and made love...
and then i cried in the bathroom because i couldn't stop thinking about ben...pathetic
i read over my previous posts, i was miserable,  i hated him and i hated me.why do i long for him? why in my silly little brain do i think im in love with him still?
crazy huh?
i dont know how to explain it..i dont know if these feelings for benjamin patrick barnett will ever turn completly sour.
ok im pretty high now and the thoughts begin to drift away.....
wait one more hit
let the think smoke sink in to my brain real good.
thats it
thats all i need
take me up up and away"

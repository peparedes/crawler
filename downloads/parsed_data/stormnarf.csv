Cause anything's better than this
Mix it up with vicadin
Cause anything's better than this
Little cuts on your wrist,
To try and get back the feeling
And no real friendships exists
That would be an understatement

I keep bad company
I'm in trouble 
Keep saying this will end 
Lining em up again
You know I'll never change 

Can we get the chemicals in
Old english is making me manic 
I go to SuicideGirls again 
To check on anything I missed 
The stitches don't even begin
To even stop up the bleeding
Can we get the chemicals in
Cause anything's better than this 

The city is dying 
(at least to me)
The city is dead now
(my kingdom for a friend)
Are you even trying 
(to find some peace)
Don't need a reason
(I get some living in)</i>"

"event","""Even so, Betelgeuse would brighten at least 10,000 times as a supernova, causing it to shine with the luminosity of a crescent Moon. Some sources predict a maximum apparent magnitude equal to about that of the full Moon (mv = -12.5). This would likely last for several months. It would look like a brilliant point, the brightness of a full Moon with the color of an incandescent bulb at night, and easily visible in daylight. After that period it would gradually diminish until after some months or years it would disappear from naked eye view. Then Orion's left shoulder would vanish for a time until, in a few centuries, a splendid nebula would develop. However, if Betelgeuse's axis (one of its poles) is pointed towards Earth there would be tangible effects here. A shower of gamma rays and other cosmic particles would be directed at Earth. There would be spectacular aurorae and possibly a measurable diminution of the ozone layer with consequent adverse radiation effects on life. In such an orientation towards the solar system it would also appear many times brighter than if its axis were pointed away.""


I really wish this would happen in my lifetime, it would be so awesome to see this. Just learned about most of this stuff in Astronomy the past week."

"event","Things rarely come my way, and when they do, I still get robbed. Summer has been very up and down, far too confusing to label it as either good or bad. I'm too emotional about things, I hate it, I've always been this way. Nothing else can tear me up quite like that. I never like getting into anything personal on this journal because its just my way of putting what I feel into words just so I can see it for myself. I don't think that made much sense, I'm not eloquent enough to be a writer. I'm already getting too negative over this, I know this weekend should be fun, but I know I won't be able to shake myself out of this depression in a short period of time like that. All of my anticipation in waiting for summer to begin has been redirected into complete disspapointment because of things I don't even have control over. I just feel like I'm not even in control of myself anymore.I'm still waiting for karma or something to step in and help me out. All I can do it just hang on to the side of this boat and let the wind take me where ever I'm supposed to be going. I wonder if the seven deadly sins have any real merit. I'm probably guilty of a few.

Results:

1. Groundhog Day
2. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
3. The Adventures of Milo and Otis
4. 2001: A Space Odyssey
5. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly
6. Shaun of the Dead
7. The Shining
8. Pulp Fiction
9. Road to Perdition
10. Gattaca

Pretty easy.

Jesse and Brad both tied for first place with 9/10. I'd give the win to Brad though, because he didn't know Road to Perdition, easily the hardest picture I put up. Jesse on the other hand didn't know what Milo and Otis was. That's pretty bad."

2 and 9 are probably the hardest. 9 would have been much better if I had found the image I wanted. 8 is so easy I shouldn't have bothered....but oh well.

"event","<i><pre><u>Evil Spirits?</u>
My dear friends:
I am going to tell you about my first experience in the 
United States.  The first day when I arrived from Greece at 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I went to the train depot to take 
the train to Rock Springs, Wyoming.  It was two o'clock in the 
afternoon and the train did not leave until three.  I sat 
in the waiting room.  I did not know a word of English.  
Ten minutes before train time, I stood up and picked up my 
two suitcases - one in each hand), and went to the door that 
led outside.  There were two glass doors which were closed.  
When I leaned forward to put down my suitcases to open the 
door, I saw the door was open. I stood up with my suitcases
in my hands and I saw the door was closed.  I leaned 
forward to put my suitcases down again and the door again 
opened.  I stood up and it closed again.  I looked around 
to see if somebody was opening and closing the door but 
there wasn't anyone.  I stood there wondering what 
evil spirits -- there were in the United States. The 
third time I must have move closer to the door 
unintentionally, and the door opened and did not close.  
Now I knew it was an electrically controlled door, 
and not -- an evil spirit.  And on my first day 
here in the United States I learned of the wonderful 
progress inthis country of liberty.

"event","<i><u>Grocery Shopping</u>
I have another funny story to tell you.  
The first week after my family came from Greece to 
Rock Springs, Wyoming, my children ate some cereal which a 
Greek friend of mine helped me buy.  My children liked it very 
much, partly on account of the good taste, but mostly on account 
of the pretty pictures of animals which they would cut out 
and play with.
One day I went to the store by myself and I tried to find 
the same cereals, but with different pictures on the 
boxes to make my children happy.  I found some very pretty 
boxes with pictures of cats and dogs on the boxes.  I paid 
for them together with some other groceries and went home.  
My children took the boxes from my arms and were very happy 
with the pretty pictures.  We sat down to breakfast and on 
opening the boxes we were surprised that the cereal was 
different.  This kind was much larger than the cereal we 
had before.  I got my English-Greek dictionary and looked 
up the words that were on the boxes, and I found I had bought 
a nice selection of dog and cat biscuits.  I threw out the 
biscuits but my children cut out the pretty pictures and played 
with them.
I think it would be a good idea to have a picture of a child 
eating on all the cereal boxes and on the boxes of dog and 
cat food, the dogs and cats should be eating.
So, my dear friends, would you please write to the cereal 
and dog and cat food companies and tell them about this so that 
other foreigners will not get confused and make the same mistakes?

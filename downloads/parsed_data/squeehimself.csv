"event","a slow cold blow of air is heard as a thick white smoke is emptyd out of the lungs of a young man into a dark room.""i could tell you a story. a story that you wouldent belive.""said the young man sitting in a hard metal chair handcuffed to it.""try me""said a man of older-age wearing a badge and a suit.the young man puts his cigerette out on the arm of the chair""allright""he says. he blanks out into his head. 

a young man is running down a street yelling or calling you would say for his mother. a screen door opens on one of the houses along the street.""yes jamie what is it""calls a woman.""ma i found a turtle i found it look""says the boy holding a turtle to his mother.""wow jamie loks like you found a new pet""she winks at him. jamie is about the age of fourteen and a strong build. growing up in central oklahoma he isent really in desprate need to stay inside anytime soon. he walks over to a girls house by the name of holina. jamie has knows holina for quite some time and they have devolped a crush of some sorts. jamie climbs up a tree and looks in through a window. jamie bears an angerd look on his face as he sees holina making love to a boy other than jamie. the boy is none other than christopher cringly his best friend.jamie shouts ""fuck you dirty tramp""as he suddenly slips off the branch he had his feet on.chris stops and turns to the window and sees nothing and takes it as the wind blowing. later that night jamie sits in his room thinking deeply.

""so is that when you...""says the badged man looking at the smoker.""no just listen"" says the young man.""have you ever tried so hard to make a friend after something bad has happend? ever try to imagine the perfect buddy? they dont allways come out very kind. they show how much anger you have inside. well what if you had a nack for making things real in your mind everything you imagined you could see clear as day. jamie is like this.""he says. the mans eyes show intrest.

jamie sat in his room all night thinking of names for a friend. he finally made on, his friends name was helden. helden was better than anyone he could do anything that jamie couldent he was ...in a sence..perfect. jame talked to helden every day for a week.ignoring food jamie became week, tired. jamie woke up everything was dark. he was in a room with helden.""make a deal with me""said helden.""what kind?""jamie replys.""i will make everything better for you thats all i want."".jamie asks""what do you want in return""he stummers."" all i want is to make you happy. but to do this i need you to stay here and keep quiet."". ""deal""shouts jamie. suddenly jamie wakes up as if a nightmare has happend.he looks around everything is bright and warm. helenas house has been set on fire and was ketching the rest of the houses in flame.""holy shit""he yelled.he ran outside to extinguish the fires or to help atleased.

jame stand at a fire truck as helena and her parents come with a police officer and walk to jamie.the officer tells jamie to come with him to the station. before he leaves his mother tosses him a pack of cigerettes and a lighter.""keep calm jamie everything will be ok use them to keep you calm.""she tells him.jamie now has a cold look on his eye accepting what has happend.the officers tells jamie""a boy died tonight. just so you know. we all think you did it jamie. he was killed with your fathers gun. and your father has been working allday.""jamie looks with a cold eye still""was it chris?""he smerks.""i think you know""says the cop.

a jerk and push all the way jamie is now seeted in a police station smoking his mother cigerettes. being interogated by an elderly cop.""so jamie whyd you do it?""he cop says.""it wasent me officer it was helden.""he says.""helden? your imaginary friend? i still says its not possible.""he says.suddenly jamie gets an evil glare and stares at the cop.""let me go now or you will get it later""jamie speaks.""kid theres ntoing you can do handcuffed to that chair"". jamie yells""LET ME GO NOW YOU FAT OLD GEEZER OR I WILL GET YOU!"". jamie then faints.the officer rushes to his side and uncuffs him.""medic!"" he yells. just as he yells it jamies eyes open wide and he whispers""helden dosent like loud noises.""

"event","hey...today was boring as shit man everyone was calling about sara being pregnent and shit. i was supposed to go up to west virginia with nikki and sarah but i wasent allowed too. when i come to sterling on thursday i am bringing nikki to the movies i dont know if anyone els is coming i dont care as long as nikki is there with me :). on thursday were goin to see shrek2 wich ive wanted to see for awhile and finaly i get to see it with my girl. i just hope i can keep my eyes on the screen i have this ungodly habbit of looking aver at her and staring then she looks at me funny and i get embarassed. warning to all.. i like the way this relationship is moving since we were good friends b4 and its moving nice and slow i think its what ive been looking for, for quite a while(hopefully she feels the same way). now back to the situation at hand. sara is pregenent with my kid and were young and NOT together so her parents wont let her have an abortions or let the kid be givin up for adoption and i am willing to rais the kid with my mother i dont expect anyone els to helpp me with my mistakes so if i had to i would do it on my own. if her parents wont give the baby to my mother i will ive up my parental right to sara's parents anythiong for the best wishes of a child. i would rather have an abortions tho. and yes sara i know your going to read this i am telling you i am with nikki now and no i dident dump you just to go out with her, i stand by my choices in what i did and my statements on what i said about how our relationship was going down hill. i understand if your mad considering this iss the second time weve been broken up and ive gone out with someone fast but there is something about nikki i really like alot. in closing i am sorry if i dragged anyone in this and if your are in it i just hope you know this drama HAS to end every thing is not a big deal(i honestly dont know what im saying i just think it sounds cool :P)."

"event","I have a few days of summer now, for the first time in a long time.  Time to catch up on all those things that I've been putting off in favor of academia.

I am finally going to visit Eva!  My obligatory outrageous college road trip has arrived.  I can't wait to be in New York again.  We'll go to Magnolia Bakery, and we'll catch a show or two at student prices.  And go to museums and get Thai food, and oh, how I love the idea of a city.  Nothing can compete with real public transportation and real cultural activity.  I think city life  can even be more environmentally friendly than rural if it's done right.  

I am going to make a beautiful scrapbook for Paris finally.  

And I'm going to pre-manage my business, Enriching Arts, for the whole summer so that I can concentrate on my internship for the Louisiana Center for Women and Government.  Something on the state level hopefully.  I find out next week.

May seems to be an unlucky month for my grandparents.  My Paw Paw on my dad's side fell over at the zoo last Thursday and broke a hip.  Fortunately, he is doing very well.  They had the surgery once his blood thickened enough to clot (he'd been on thinners), and he is already stubbornly refusing the pain medicine.  Physical therapy is getting him to stand up, though not on his own, and because of the kind of break, he'll be able to bear weight on it soon.  My Maw Maw is another story: she wouldn't leave his side for five days, not for anything...  

But they'll both heal, and life is good."

"event","but I am greedy with life.



I need to decide what to do my honors thesis on.
-Explore links between music, foreign language study and literacy?
-Write a series of cultural studies essays along the line of Barthes' Mythologies?
-Discuss intertextuality of portrayal of women from Ibsen to T Williams?

-Develop educational reform theory and tactics for enforcing a revolution?
-Another life study of someone such as Hildegard of Bingen? Elisabeth Shoeneur (sp)?
-Elaborate on the Simulacrum of the Southern Bell and the Original Sin of the Idea of Purity?

-Write and stage a postmodern play/ musical.
-Record a cd of jazz standards with my father.
-Something to do with the environment/ environmental law/ ecological science

-How to build a green New Orleans that actually functions as a contemporary city and a city for the future?
-Create a lesson plan for a children's course based on various learning styles and my own philosophy on eduacation, which I must also finally articulate
-Create a lesson plan for a literature and religion college course featuring Life of Pi, White Noise, choses comme ca...


Anyone have any favorites out of these?   Or other ideas?
Should I go to law school?  Teach for America?  Study Hinduism in India?  Escape to France forever?"

"event","I'm back.  The last few days in Paris were mind-blowing and heartbreaking and  generally awe inspiring and now I'm back in the land where people speak English, or Spanish.  At least when we went to Christopher's family parties I could get a bit of my French fix in.  I keep forgetting not to speak in French when I'm in a store or a restaurant or such.  I walk in and start to say, ""Bonjour."" 

On the plane to Chicago, our flight attendants, lovely bilingual people that they are, assumed we were French.  I have to remember that English is not trying to be rude...  

I was having a hugely difficult time adjusting when we first arrived, but a sushi lunch with Brady restored my faith in America a bit.

It took me less than 24 hours to make my mom cry unhappy tears.

I feel better about visiting family now that I'm doing it.  I still want to go back asap, but the need isn't so desperate now.  

Joyeux Noel everyone."

Is it only a week and a day since I was hanging out in Baton Rouge?  It seems so long ago already.  I'm really glad Laura made us watch Coal Miner's Daughter, and it was so much fun to have a sleep over.  A good send off, indeed.  LL, have you been in touch with Zeno?   Christopher and I will be trying to contact her soon.

Brittney, it was great to see you and Todd, even though we all had to hear my awful rendition of Patsy Cline's Crazy.  I so excited you finally got to meet Laura.  

This past Friday, my mother almost tried to make me sing the same song when Daddy's band played at Elmwood.  Fortunately, the mean woman working the bar (mind you, a smoke-free bar in a family friendly atmosphere where she is home by midnight regardless of a band's end time) decided to shut out the lights on the band while they were on their last song because they were two minutes past ten o'clock.  I didn't really want to sing, but that's just rude to the band.  Even typing about it now a week later I still have a mind to call and complain about her.  I have no sympathy for people who have an attitude at their jobs.  If you don't like what you're doing, quit.  I guess I should acknowledge that not everyone has that luxury, but honestly, this woman does not fit that category.  A bar tender at a nationally known health club? Please.

I don't want to forget to write about my day with mom (last Friday), but right now I have to go cajun dancing with Madeline and Patrick.   Goodbyes are always so difficult, but in making sure I spend time with everyone before I leave, I've been more social this week than almost the whole summer."

"event","It is nearly mid August, and I am finally experiencing summer.  

My camps are all complete; wonderful adventure that they are, I am glad to have some down time.  I was especially excited to be a returning faculty member for J's camp and to have successfully done the whole entrepreneurship thing again.  I am destined to be surrounded by oodles and oodles of kids for the rest of my life, hopefully not all my own.  For now, I have at least four months before I'll need to even think about thinking of lesson plans, and even though I'm sure I'll come up with a few just for fun, I am so glad to lower the stress levels in my life.  
On a shallow note, my complexion is visibly thankful for the calm as well, though I guess that since skin is an outward reflection of allover health, not too shallow.  

I'm nervous about not really having jobs lined up for Chicago, but, really , I was juggling Enriching Arts, Summer Bridge, RecPlex, Phon-a-thon, and sporadic odd jobs.  Vacations are yummy.  

Last week, Christopher and I threw a party for my brother's 18th birthday at our apartment (my parents came, which means that my parents saw our apartment for the first time).  We had paella, and cake and ice cream, and swamp juice, and a gloriously spotless apartment decorated to complement our diverse interests and tastes quite stylishly if I do say so myself.  My brother's friends, my brothers, and my parents not only all fit in our place at the same time, they met the plants, hung out on the couch, and seemed very at ease.  Maybe even impressed?  My mom, while having fun cleaning dishes with me after, said she really liked what we'd done and that she thought the decoration motifs were excellent.  She was proud that she could pass on something other than cellulite and the ability to lose keys.  Silly Mama.  

It felt really good, to be an adult (somehow and so suddenly) but to be doing well and to have that acknowledged.

My celebration came paired (as most things in this city seem to) with some destruction as well.  And I'm actually not referring to WWIII or to the current cockroach war of Hrothgar II.  I finally went to my grandparents house in New Orleans  East.  Strange,  I can't say that it was anything especially cathartic.  I sort of just started working, carting things out, and laughing like I couldn't help it, tossing sentimental everything onto the curb...Dad's senior sweater, the last outfit my Maw Maw was sewing for me (and fussing about)  a picture of a ballerina,  her sewing machine. 

 I couldn't help thinking that she's lucky not to remember.  She sometimes thinks Katrina didn't come.  She talks about how she forgot to pack a toothbrush, as if she just arrived.  She knows, but she doesn't know, all that she's lost.  Paw Paw Honey knows what he's yet to lose, what he's losing everyday.  

I couldn't help thinking that much of what we mourn was just locked up in a closet somewhere, supposedly above floodwaters but also above our everyday lives.  Just there, but not really there.  That some of it wouldn't have ever been missed if it weren't for the storm.  

I couldn't help thinking Zen.  That it's all clutter anyway.  That it's good to be free of it.  That our memories are the past and gone, but also that it is our memories that shape our personalities, that we are our pasts.  Still, our pasts are not objects, mementos.  We are our best representation of our past, and we are more than that.  If we can't let go of it in tangible form, though, we're missing out on today.  Rest in Peace, Professor Wren.  

I couldn't help thinking.  But I wasn't really thinking.  I was doing.  Lifting, peeling, coaxing a frog into daylight, throwing things as far I could throw.  I couldn't help thinking.  Almost a year."

"event","to write a eulogy for Paw Paw.  I have never lost someone before, and this someone is so wonderful.  was so wonderful.  is.  My eulogy will be about immortality.

Thursday night, the last time I saw him, I am so glad I went, I thought it would be that night, he was finally back in his own home.  In his living room, surrounded by his family he could finally be peaceful.  He hung on until the next morning.  Long enough that Maw Maw could sneak out and away from Aunt Kathy long enough to be up with him in the middle of the night.  Long enough that, with his work ethic in mind, my mom went to work, Daniel went to class, David went to Nocca, I went to sing.  We lived and he left.  He left nothing unfinished.  We were blessed enough to have time to say goodbye these past few weeks, and still he left behind so much.  So much good.  So much love.  So many things that if they were said about anyone else would be cliches.  But nothing about him was cliche or tired or stale.  He was alive, and when he wasn't, his life stayed as our example, the epitome of a man, the epitome of a Catholic, the epitome of positive energy and goodness and appreciation and I am going to write this.

I don't want this to become the Linda show, though.  I've written his obituary and I'm singing and Uncle Rick is playing and everyone is doing something.  But these words need to come from all of us.  I haven't even been here for twenty of his eighty-five years yet.  I want everyone in this."

"event","so much and too much.  We're losing him.  And I had been so optimistic that I wasn't preparing for this at all.  He is so amazing, and I love him so much.

Last weekend, my mom took Maw Maw to come see Grease, and I realized that I'd never seen Maw Maw without Paw Paw, ever.  Not in public, not at home, they have always been a pair to me. They just celebrated their sixtieth wedding anniversary, and as Maw Maw said in the hospital the other day, explaining how she'd gotten up in the middle of the night confused as to why he wasn't next to her, ""After sixty years, you get kind of attached.""  

And I know I should be approaching this positively, and in some ways I am.  He is able to keep his dignity this way.  When I saw him on Friday, I could tell how frustrated he was.  To have to relearn how to stick out your tongue and swallow and try to talk clearly, to have to ask to use the bathroom, to have people probing and probably oversimplifying and just so many things, after nearly ninety years, why should he want to move into that sort of stage?  But we are all projecting our thoughts, hopes, rationalizations, and fears on him and he cannot articulate what it is he is actually feeling.  He was even so smart as to think about these sort of situations and sign a living will, so in some ways we are guided as to what he wants.  I can't 

I'm making him a cd because that is something I can physically do for him.  There are so many things I want to describe.  So many things I don't want to forget.  I can't right now.  I've never done this before.  I have been so lucky.  I am so lucky.  I've spent nearly twenty years with this amazing man in my life.

"event","I've been checking out my residents all week.  I'm really going to miss being an RA to them.  But I won't miss all this paperwork!

I think that I'm moving an average of every four months now.  There is obviously something sad about leaving behind a home, turning in all my keys (you know that ratio of keys to responsibility?), but it is also satisfying to empty everything out and dust and vacuum and see the emptiness.  
Last night was difficult, but today I am almost ready to say good bye.  I just have few more things to load into the car once Chris gets back.

It is strange to be moving in with him.  Even though we lived together in Chicago, that situation seems worlds apart.  This time it is a conscious, planned decision.  Although I say I don't have a room in my parent's house, they would make something work if I needed them to.  And as much as I complain about dorm life, being the RA with my own room and spending the university's money wasn't a bad gig.  I will definitely miss living ten steps away from the nearest friend, but it's a trade off.  

I know that this is the last time in my life where that sort of living arrangement seems reasonable, so it makes me reluctant to let go.  I don't want to rush into the ""adult"" world as I know there's no way of turning back without tucking my tail between my legs, but I don't see that happening.  One, I don't have a tail, and two, I'm ready for this."

"event","Every muscle and bone in my body hurts, but my heart feels really good.  I didn't think I had it in me, to throw away someone else's life in possessions, but I did indeed gut a house today for someone in St. Bernard.  This morning I woke up before seven and woke up the people on my floor who'd asked me to, and we started out to main campus.  (The one thing I like about the RA job is being able to meet good people and to have a positive impact in their lives- to open a door and make these kinds of opportunities more available to them.  I really love my floor; if it weren't for the awful bureaucracy, I'd apply again.)
 
 Although the turnout for the gutting was less than I'd hoped, it was a successful floor program and for me a successful venture overall.    Project Hope and LUCAP are both great organizations, and I wish they had more volunteers, but people are  much more content wishing they could help than actually helping.  I know.  I've done that.  It's taken me way too long to get out there, but I'm going back as soon as I can.  

  Grease is going as well as can be expected.  I kind of  wish I was Rizzo instead of Sandy, but I guess I'm in no position to complain.  By the time we open it should be a good show; needs a lot of work in the meantime.  In other countries of the world of theatre, my little brother, still in eighth grade is already starring in NOCCA plays, the little brat.  Really, though, he has talent and it's the one thing he takes seriously.  He was hilarious in his SCS show; Chris and Laura and I went to see his last show and perhaps had too much fun, but I was really proud of him.  I can't believe he's so old/young.  A kid I worked with when I helped with Jesuit's choreography for Blake just facebooked me, and his birth year is 1991.  Crazy.

  Oh, surprise, surprise, I am going into education.  Not changing my major again, but for grad school.  And I'm really happy with that decision, excited even.  Maybe I'll be the next Montessori."

I've been planning stuff for my floor, thinking about how to make it a great semester, and reminiscing about last semester.  Chicago was beautiful and taught me a lot.  About people, about college and enjoying myself, about frigidity.  Overall, a bewildering and liberating adventure to the north.

Now I have to fix New Orleans.  I, the eternal, sardonic optimist, have complete faith in the stubborness of these people; just look at the self expression on the abandoned refridgerators for instance. (Peter spoiled me rotten)?

"event","actually today was boring as fuck i had to go to my grandmas to see some relatives and eat filipino food it was ok i just got sick from the food. when i was my grandmas i thinking about a dream i had..haha, i was really closed off at her house i just listened to my head phones like normal and day dreamed.....sometime i wish i was a breakdancer who dated an acrobat we would have really strange sex.  i wish i could make everyone happy even me sometimes but i cant so ill just find someone special and make them the happiest person.  ive been practicing my hand style cause i came to the conclusion i will always be a tagger or bomber not a piecer which is the reason i began writing i always wanted to bust a full blown mural that when other artist walk by and say what the fuck was that guy thinking with a fear of going over me so ill just have to do that bombing and tagging my favorite thing about graffiti is shopping making shit finding new stores new artist new styles writing the same thing over and over again just to get a certain look i love it when i find a artist i look up to but ive never met him i just look out for him and collect photos of him or his stuff i mean like cave all i know about him is hes from big sur and hes really really good i may still be a toy but i know what is what and whos who in the graff world. that was the random gibberish i was thinking about at my grandmas

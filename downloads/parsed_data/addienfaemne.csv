"event","Mourners are crowding in Pyongyang. There will be no &ldquo;Asian Winter&rdquo; to counter the Arab Spring because an overthrow demands a resistance, and there isn&rsquo;t much of one (and this wasn&rsquo;t an overthrow, but rather an old leader dying of old age.) Kim Jong Il and his father purged a resistance long ago, as Bradley K Martin has painstakingly documented in Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader.&nbsp;

Jong Il undoubtedly committed dozens of human rights atrocities, and was a tyrant. His father, Il Sung, was not much better, although even voluntary North Korean political refugees often express great affection for the man.&nbsp;

However, of those who leave North Korea, most are economic migrants seeking temporary labor in China, and over half willingly return.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we cannot ignore those languishing in the prison camps of Yodok and elsewhere, to pretend as though the regime doesn&rsquo;t have a degree of support amongst its people is a Western fantasy.

North Korea is a human rights disaster. Millions have died from famine, and thousands are imprisoned in the camps of Yodok and elsewhere. We don&rsquo;t know the mind of North Korea, but you can&rsquo;t program the displays of grief on broad display in the capital.

We know North Korea is a human rights disaster. But North Koreans seem to, if not love, at least know nothing else other than the status quo. This isn&rsquo;t a Stalinist regime where people are waiting to be &ldquo;rescued&rdquo;. What then, is the ethical way for the world stage to move forward?

The reaction so far in my current hometown of Gwangju, by the way, is mostly apathy. My students and coworkers have expressed happiness that he is gone, but they know it&rsquo;s business as usual. The only vocalized concern I&rsquo;ve heard so far is that Kim Jong Un will become more daring as he attempts to solidify his grasp of power as the new &ldquo;party center&rdquo;.

Oh, and I still lurk around here, I&#39;ve just found LJ is mostly dead these days. Long live Tumblr, kekeke"

"event","In the wake of Fukushima I may be hosting a friend of mine and her lovely wife, both ESL teachers in Japan, for some time if the worst case scenario happens with the nuclear reactors. From my understanding the radiation situation in their prefecture is very precarious. Obviously, their coming here would be a worst case scenario - but it's still a possibility with the way everything is up in the air right now. 

Never have I&nbsp;been more grateful to have a roof over my head and an open door for friends. And never have I&nbsp;thought more about how important it is to do the same for others, as they might do for you in the future."

"event","Long time no talk. I usually use my tumblr for updates, but I&nbsp;figure ol' LJ&nbsp;could use some attention, too!&nbsp;What's up, y'all?&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I went to HomePlus (Korea's answer to Wal-Mart:&nbsp;Supercenters, because Korea doesn't allow Wal-Mart in the country - no joke) and stocked up on home goods to make my apartment feel more like, well... a home. Why? <br /><br />Because, while it's still very tentative visa-paperwork-wise, my boss asked me to stay another year and I&nbsp;said<strong> HELLS YES.</strong> Yay!!!!!!!<br /><br />In short:&nbsp;I&nbsp;love my school. I&nbsp;love the small class sizes, the kids I've gotten to know and love, and the camaraderie we've developed. I&nbsp;love my neighborhood, an upper-middle class section of metropolitan Gwangju near parks and mountains with lots of hiking. <br /><br />And - why lie? - I&nbsp;love saving the money. My goal right now is to put away $1000 USD a month to help fund a master's degree program in education with a teacher training focus, or a teacher training post-bac. I&nbsp;love teaching, and it makes sense to get more experience doing ESL&nbsp;while making grad school as practical - and debt-free - as possible. <br /><br />My challenge during the next year is making another social group, because, with English teaching as transient as it is, most of the main members of my social group have returned to the States to start graduate school or jobs back home.  And there's still so much of Korea I&nbsp;haven't seen - the old capital at Gyeongju, the DMZ, the beaches of Busan, and thousands of gorgeous temples. So there's still a bunch of exploring left yet!&nbsp;<br /><br />Here are some other goals I&nbsp;have so I&nbsp;don't forget:&nbsp;<br /><ul><li>Visit Evan Jeshka in Japan next year over Chuseok.</li><li>Fix up some things in my apartment so it feels like more of a home - replace some lights, get my janky old refrigerator looked at.</li><li>Take and pass the beginner Korean proficiency test - sounds nuts, but this could actually help me get Bilingual ed certification back home. And it would definitely help my resume as an ESL teacher. :)&nbsp;</li><li>Plan a longer, two month trip around Southeast Asia before finishing my second contract. I&nbsp;want to see Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia before returning home.</li></ul>Finally, I&nbsp;will probably get a few weeks to come back to the States before starting a second contract so I will probably do a side trip to Philly to see Mike, Dayna, and Arielle before coming back to Korea. Is there anyone else who would just love to meet up?&nbsp;This would be in January and I'd be happy to travel about. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, my friend Dan and I&nbsp;just got back from a nutso Korean food festival. We saw a cake made to look like a gigantic pirate ship and a marzipan sculpture of a dragon. So.... those pics are going up, soon. LOL"

"event","Lately I&rsquo;ve been having a real emotional struggle about whether or not to re-sign with the same hagwon in Gwangju. I know y'all aren't in Korea, but maybe you can help me unpack my emotional stuff.&nbsp; <p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking:</p> <ul><li>Aside from a few random issues, my hagwon boss treats me really  well. She&rsquo;s very considerate and kind. This is NOT typical in the hagwon  industry. And while I&nbsp;will probably find another job, more and more Americans are coming out here because of the bad economy. I'm starting to think it's smarter to stay with a situation I&nbsp;know than go back to a situation I&nbsp;don't.</li></ul><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t have that much holiday, but I can always take a big holiday  (like I&rsquo;m planning) after Year 2. And my day-to-day schedule is not that  strenuous. My total number of teaching-contact hours per day is 6. It's a 40-hour week so a little longer than most hagwon teachers, but my day flies by pretty quickly.</li></ul><ul><li>I am becoming really attached to my students, particularly the  kindergartners. If I leave and another fresh-off-the-boat teacher is  brought in to replace me, these young children will have to deal with a new teacher who  doesn&rsquo;t know them, probably doesn&rsquo;t know how to teach (not that I did on  Day One, but still, they&rsquo;d have to go through it AGAIN) and may or may  not give a shit about teaching. A lot of people come out here just to fart around, not because they actually want to be teachers. It&rsquo;s starting to feel like it would be a  disservice to them to up and leave after the year is up.</li></ul><ul><li>IDK. I like my apartment. I like the students. I like Gwangju. I  like my life here. Going through the hagwon or public school process  will be another crap shoot.</li></ul> <p>Here&rsquo;s the big con: My family and friends.</p> <p>I&rsquo;d probably only get to go home and see family and friends for 2  weeks. And that is pretty generous length of break, but&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t seen everyone in a  year.</p> <p>Is it fair to Lauren and my mom and friends like Dayna and Mike and my aunt and IDK, everyone.... to be gone from their lives for  another entire year with only a small break in between? Maybe I&nbsp;just need to suck it up, spend some real time with family and friends, and then come back for the year. <br /><br />On the other hand, I&rsquo;m  an adult now, and this is just one tiny piece of my life out of the  years I plan to be home in the States, barring getting hit by a bus or something, IDK. I want to do another year, backpack for a few months, and then come back to the States for good. So it's not like OMG ABANDONING ALL Y'ALL 4EVER.<br /><br /> So what is the best course of  action?</p> <p>I&rsquo;m really really torn. I think of family and friends. And then I  think of my day-to-day with the kids and even silly simple interactions  like the boss&rsquo;s 10 year old son deciding he&rsquo;s my &ldquo;Korean teacher&rdquo; and  making up little lessons for me and those little joys. And how it might  be more &ldquo;right&rdquo; to give these kids another year. Not that English  conversational teaching is <em>Stand and Deliver </em>or anything, just they deserve some consistency.</p> <p>TL;DR give me life advice please?</p>"

Beijing is many things. It is the vastness and
 awe-inspiring facade of  the Forbidden City. It is the feng shui 
geomantic order of the Temple of  Heaven. It is also the Great Wall and 
Tiananmen Square and the eyes of  Mao looking, looking everywhere.  But 
it is also the multitude of foreigners and locals, bikers and  hustlers 
and grifters and salt-of-the-earth workers, Chinese  out-of-towners on a
 summer vacation asking to take a photo with the  white lady. 
It&amp;#8217;s the air pollution that hazes the air and  creates 
bittersweet, beautiful sunsets, that tinges everything. It is  the CCTV 
building looming like a giant AT-AT on the city&amp;#8217;s  collective 
consciousness, the Bird&amp;#8217;s Nest that is now woefully  egg-less 
post-Olympics. It is the street food, piping hot, you can buy  in one of
 the cities 467&amp;#160;hutong, or alleyways, perfect  east-west 
streets aligned with ramshackle courtyards that call to mind a  China of
 yore. Here is how Dan and I proceeded through Beijing: Thursday. We 
arrived in the Beijing Capital Airport to be greeted by the  facade of a
 Starbucks - first thing. We loved it.  We spent the evening orienting 
ourselves, wandering about the tacky  tourist spectacle that is 
Wangfujing Dajie and marveling at the haggle,  haggle, haggle in the 
hutong street markets. We gawked at the Forbidden  City in the evening. 
We laughed at a con artists&amp;#8217; obvious  game. We also marveled 
at this crazy looking statue thing.  Friday Was the Forbidden City and 
the Temple of Heaven park, home of the  famous Confucian edifice. Then 
we got rained on. But a yummy Peking  duck from a tourist trap 
restaurant we nevertheless loved saved the day.   Saturday we spent the 
whole time at the 798 Art District, a collection  of over 150 art 
galleries outside of Beijing&amp;#8217;s city center. It  was absolutely
 worth it to look at the latest in Chinese contemporary  art. Some of it
 was hack-ish and uninspiring. But a whole lot of it was  
thought-provoking, intense, forward - and unmistakably Chinese.  Sunday 
was the Great Wall at Mutianyu, a far superior hike than its  
tourist-trap section Badaling. We rode a cable car up, walked a few  
kilometers of the Wall through the fog, and then took a ski lift down - 
 one of the only sections of Wall where such a fun ride is possible. In 
 nicer weather, you can also tobbogan down to the Wall&amp;#8217;s base -
  how is that not awesome?  We also checked out the Silk Market and I 
successively haggled for an  amazing blue 100% silk robe. I probably 
still paid too much for it, but  it was damned worth it. Three days does
 not a Beijing expert make, by any means! But here are  some quick tips 
and fast impressions on getting around the place:   Hoof about the 
hutong. Far from being mere alleyways,  Beijing&amp;#8217;s hutong 
(&amp;#8220;more numerous than the hairs of  the ox&amp;#8221; is an old
 Chinese proverb) are rich with scrumptious  food stalls, 
people-watching, antiques-shopping, and courtyard scenes  that you 
won&amp;#8217;t see anywhere else about the planet. Were I to  go again 
tomorrow, I&amp;#8217;d rent a bike and explore each one.   Beware the 
scammers. Dan and I were wise to the shady ones, but unlike  relatively 
petty-crime-free Korea, there are plenty of nice-seeming gals  just 
wanting to &amp;#8220;practice their English&amp;#8221; in  Tiananmen - 
who then try to isolate you to a  &amp;#8220;tea-house&amp;#8221; or 
&amp;#8220;art-exhibition&amp;#8221;.  Make no mistake - their English 
is fine, and 99% of the time  they&amp;#8217;re out to rob you of your 
Mao-printed bills. Price  gouging for the clueless white people is also 
rampant. Use your common  sense. Keep your bullshit-meter finely tuned.&nbsp;
  Whether you&amp;#8217;re at a hotel or a hostel or a guest-house, get a
  hotel business card or ask your host to write the name of your place 
in  English and Mandarin Get a mini-map drawn if possible. Better yet, 
buy a  well-marked map in English and Mandarin off Wangfujing. This will
 make  your experience with cab drivers relatively painless.&nbsp;  
Don&amp;#8217;t be public-transportation shy. Dan and I saw 0 fellow  
foreigners on the buses, but bus fare is about 2 yuan - a pittance,  
about 30 cents - and most stops have names written in English. The  
subway is crowded, but far cheapter than constant cab rides, which can  
add up. Our fare to the Great Wall was super-cheap - just 12 Yuan - a  
little over a dollar - for passage to Mutianyu. Compare that to upwards 
 of 200 yuan for a private driver or a pressed-for-time tourist bus,  
which may also take you to some garish consumer traps along the way.   
Haggle like a mofo. Things are pretty cheap in &amp;#8216;Jing, but you 
 can make them cheaper. Even if it makes you uncomfortable, walk away  
from purchases, even if you&amp;#8217;re committed to them. We got  
prices slashed up to 80 percent that way.&nbsp; Try the Peking duck. Anthony 
Bourdain I&amp;#8217;m not, and  I&amp;#8217;m sure some Mandarin 
maestras will turn down their nose at  enjoying such a tourist-y dish, 
but that shit really is as good as  everyone says. Additionally, try the
 hotpot and the Tomato pringles  (Yes, they exist.) And anything that 
looks yummy from a vendor.  Don&amp;#8217;t think too hard about where 
it comes from.   Oh, FYI? There are also Seaweed pringles. I 
wouldn&amp;#8217;t recommend  those."" /></a></p> <p><strong>Beijing, bada-bing. </strong></p> <p>Beijing is many things.

In nicer weather, you can also <strong>tobbogan   down </strong>to the Wall&rsquo;s base - how is that not awesome?</p> <p><img height=""540"" width=""720"" alt="""" src=""http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs037.ash2/35216_729971788527_608296_41143981_4310731_n.jpg"" /></p> <p>We also checked out the <strong>Silk Market</strong> and I   successively haggled for an amazing blue 100% silk robe. I probably   still paid too much for it, but it was damned worth it.</p> <p>Three days does not a Beijing expert make, by any means! But here are   some quick tips and fast impressions on getting around the place:</p> <ol><li><strong>Hoof about the hutong. </strong>Far from being mere  alleyways,  Beijing&rsquo;s <em>hutong </em>(&ldquo;more numerous than the hairs of  the ox&rdquo; is  an old Chinese proverb) are rich with scrumptious food  stalls,  people-watching, antiques-shopping, and courtyard scenes that  you won&rsquo;t  see anywhere else about the planet. Were I to go again  tomorrow, I&rsquo;d <strong>rent  a bike</strong> and explore each one.</li><li><strong>Beware the scammers</strong>. Dan and I were wise to the  shady  ones, but unlike relatively petty-crime-free Korea, there are  plenty of  nice-seeming gals just wanting to &ldquo;practice their English&rdquo; in  Tiananmen -  who then try to isolate you to a &ldquo;tea-house&rdquo; or  &ldquo;art-exhibition&rdquo;. Make  no mistake - their English is fine, and 99% of  the time they&rsquo;re out to  rob you of your Mao-printed bills. Price  gouging for the clueless white  people is also rampant. Use your common  sense. Keep your bullshit-meter  finely tuned.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Whether you&rsquo;re at a hotel or a hostel or a guest-house, get  a  hotel business card </strong>or ask your host to write the name of  your  place in <strong>English and Mandarin</strong> Get a mini-map  drawn if  possible. Better yet, buy a well-marked map in English and  Mandarin off  Wangfujing. This will make your experience with cab  drivers relatively  painless.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be public-transportation shy</strong>. Dan and I saw 0   fellow foreigners on the buses, but bus fare is about 2 yuan - a   pittance, about 30 cents - and most stops have names written in English.   The subway is crowded, but far cheapter than constant cab rides, which   can add up. Our fare to the Great Wall was super-cheap - <em>just 12   Yuan</em> - a little over a dollar - for passage to<strong> Mutianyu</strong>.   Compare that to upwards of 200 yuan for a private driver or a   pressed-for-time tourist bus, which may also take you to some garish   consumer traps along the way.</li><li><strong>Haggle like a mofo. </strong>Things are pretty cheap in  &lsquo;Jing,  but you can make them cheaper. Even if it makes you  uncomfortable, walk  away from purchases, even if you&rsquo;re committed to  them. We got prices  slashed <em>up to 80 percent</em> that way.&nbsp;</li><li>Try the <strong>Peking duck.</strong> Anthony Bourdain I&rsquo;m not, and   I&rsquo;m sure some Mandarin maestras will turn down their nose at enjoying   such a tourist-y dish, but that shit really is as good as everyone says.   Additionally, try the <strong>hotpot</strong> and the <strong>Tomato   pringles</strong> (Yes, they exist.) And anything that looks yummy from a   vendor. Don&rsquo;t think too hard about where it comes from.</li></ol> <p>Oh, FYI? There are also Seaweed pringles. I would<em> not</em>  recommend those.</p> <p><img height=""540"" width=""720"" alt="""" src=""http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs194.snc4/38043_729971239627_608296_41143945_8022938_n.jpg"" /></p> <!-- END TUMBLR CODE --></div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <div class=""post-header""><span class=""date""><a href=""http://jessicainkorea.tumblr.com/post/753283598/on-classroom-management-and-teaching"">June  30, 2010</a></span>                                &nbsp;                <span class=""notes"">                11 notes                                                </span></div></lj-cut>"

"event","Kids are kids everywhere, but there are definitely cultural differences that make teaching a different experience in Korea than in America. I've been thinking about some of the differences and decided to start listing them. <br /><br />Here are some things normal with Korean students that Americans would flip out about:&nbsp;<br /><br /><blockquote> <ul><li>Kids joking about shooting each other (they&rsquo;re truly innocent of the  sinister overtones of, say, a school shooting, so it&rsquo;s all a joke.) Can you imagine that happening in America?&nbsp;The guidance counselor would be called in and parents notified immediately. </li></ul><ul><li>Kids casually hitting each other for lulz. (This also isn&rsquo;t  malicious - it&rsquo;s seen as rough-housing.) I was actually disturbed the first few times I&nbsp;witnessed this - trying to intervene - until I&nbsp;realized that the kids were having a good time and enjoying fighting. Contrast with the American &quot;OMG!&nbsp;YOU BARELY TOUCHED THIS OTHER PERSON!&nbsp;VIOLENCE IS RONG!&quot; attitude. </li></ul><ul><li>Boys coming to school with manicures - I was trying to figure this  out and apparently one dude k-pop star started painting his nails, so no  one gives a F here and they think it&rsquo;s cool. Seriously, it&rsquo;s SO  REFRESHING to see men not feeling like they have to live up to some  hypermasculine Tough Guy ideal. And they also dress stylishly!&nbsp;No kid-ult like huge cargo pants and stupid t-shirts!&nbsp;This is my favorite thing, actually. </li></ul><ul><li>Kids casually swearing - while the students are EONS more respectful  to me than American students are/were, swearing isn&rsquo;t seen as a &ldquo;big  deal&rdquo; or something &ldquo;children shouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m told this varies  somewhat, though. I had to explain to them that while &quot;Shippal seki&quot;&nbsp;(a Korean swear) and &quot;Fuck you&quot; are OK to say to each other and in class in Korea, if they said someone &quot;Fuck you&quot;&nbsp;in America, unless they knew them very well, it would be REALLY bad. </li></ul><ul><li>Kids sharing answers and helping less advanced kids&nbsp;finish the  assignment&nbsp;- it&rsquo;s seen more as collaborative learning than &ldquo;cheating.&rdquo; There isn't that much of a focus on individualized learning, I've noticed - although, obviously, the standardized test is King. </li></ul> None of this is written judgmentally - I&rsquo;m trying to remember and  analyze what separates my Korean classroom experience from my American  classroom experience. And it&rsquo;s interesting to think about Why Things Are  The Way They Are. The biggest observation (negative for American):  Korean kids and teachers aren&rsquo;t always fearing being slapped with a Big  Lawsuit by some litigious parent. So kids and teachers tend to keep it  &ldquo;realer&rdquo; than they would in the sometimes sanctimonious and  hyper-policed American classrooms.<br /><br />I realize most people reading this aren't teachers, but I&nbsp;figure it's pretty interesting, at least culturally. <br /> <br /></blockquote>"

Robert Rodriguez released an early trailer for his forthcoming ""Machete"" (itself a fake trailer before his Grindhouse that he decided to turn into a movie) as a ""special response"" to SB1070 in Arizona. 

You guys. You <i>guys</i>. Danny Trejo. Cheech. Robert DeNiro. STEVEN SEAGAL. Lindsay Lohan acting the fool. A send-up of 70s' exploitation films. ""They just fucked with the wrong Mexican."" 

This is going to be <i>so amazing</i>."

It would be YEARS before I&nbsp;ever got sick in America. Now? Every 3 weeks or so, my immune system goes haywire thanks to yet another bug the snotty-nosed children bring in, or the TERRIBLE air quality. 

My hagwon director is good people, but like every hagwon director dragging her feet on getting me insurance. Thankfully, I&nbsp;don't have to push it because medical care here is 1st world - but also VERY cheap.

So I&nbsp;'m heading to the hospital tomorrow (hospitals aren't just for serious emergencies here)&nbsp;and requesting an English-speaking doctor and some heavy-duty medicine. 

I'm SICK (pun!) of living like this."

"event","<div class=""post_title"">But I really have nothing to say these days.</div> <p>Teaching leaves me tired and wanting to zone out at the end of the day. I  have no energy to blog! Especially teaching kindergartners - I'm with four different groups of kindergarten kids for 3 hours a day, and while I love me some adorable Korean kindergarten kids to death, they're <em>exhausting. </em><br /><br />I come home and play computer games and read until bedtime, or head to the jjimjilbang (public steam/bath rooms which are really nice, ubiquitous in Korea, and not shady at all.) <br /><br />It's good work. It's rewarding work. It's enjoyable work. But it's definitely <em>work. </em>I have SO MUCH RESPECT for kindergarten teachers. Their job - to basically nourish a love for education in tiny human beings - is such a responsibility!&nbsp;It looks easy from the outside - but it's so not.</p> <p>My only observation of the day: Koreans love them some sweet potatoes. For  some reason every pizza I order is stuffed with sweet potato paste in the crust. And gift-giving is seriously important to friendship here - my kids are giving me small gifts (usually food)&nbsp;like every other day. Guess what gift the piano academy teacher brought to the kindergarten yesterday? Yup - tons and tons of boiled sweet potatoes. Here, people just eat them as a snack. <br /><br />I'm trying to get more in the gift-giving spirit - Koreans really are a million times more generous, even as casual acquaintances, than Americans are. It seems to be really important for building friendships in a way that is just not true in American culture And it's fun!&nbsp;Yesterday I declared it &quot;Sticker Day&quot;&nbsp;for my students and they all got many fun additions to their sticker books. For the teachers, I brought hodu kwaja (Korean for little walnut cakes. They're served at coffee shops and are oh-so-tasty.) Everyone seemed to like it. I&nbsp;just feel so stingy compared to all the kids and the teachers here - whenever they bring anything, it's ALWAYS to share. <br /><br />Also! I may visit China on Buddha's birthday weekend in May with some friends from my Dungeons and Dragons group here in Gwangju. We want to visit Beijing and see the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. I'm thinking in September I'll visit Shanghai to see the World Expo which is supposed to be a reprise of the great World's Fairs of yore. <br /><br />What's up with you guys?&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I just learned that there is more than one Valentine's Day in South Korea!&nbsp;In fact, there are many!&nbsp;

Here are a few of them:&nbsp;

Feb 14th - Red Valentine's Day. Girls give boys chocolate, and not vice versa.
March 14th - White Valentine's Day. Boys give girls chocolate! 
April 14th - &quot;Black&quot;&nbsp;Valentine's Day. Singles congregate and eat &quot;black&quot;&nbsp;noodles to symbolize the blackness of their single hearts. I&nbsp;am not making this up. 
May 14th - &quot;Roses&quot;&nbsp;Valentine's Day. Flower exchange.
June 14th - Yellow Day - Teddy bear exchange.
July 14th - Kiss Day - self-explanatory.

I&nbsp;kind of love the Korean tendency to make up a holiday about EVERYTHING. I swear to God there is a festival every weekend here. It makes life exciting!&nbsp;"

Very sad, very sad.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;IV line.&rdquo; (One of the kids even got up with a marker and drew the picture of the IV line and  the mom in a hospital bed on the chalkboard!)</p> <p>&ldquo;Very very sick.&rdquo;</p> <p>The kid in question kept saying &ldquo;No, no, is fine,&rdquo; so I thought this  meant she WAS at the hospital, but was fine.</p> <p>At the end of class I was like: &ldquo;Is your mom really OK?&rdquo;</p> <p>He looks at me, starts cracking up laughing, and says &ldquo;Is all lies!&rdquo;</p> <p>I ABOUT LOST IT.</p> <p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound that funny writing it out, but there was something  about the fact that this barely-conversational group of kids looked up  the words for &ldquo;ambulance&rdquo;, &ldquo;IV,&rdquo; &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;, and &ldquo;very sick&rdquo; just to  troll their teacher&hellip; and clearly planned the whole charade before class started&hellip;  and I&nbsp;fell for it... just cracked me the hell up.</p>"

"event","It looks like <lj user=""jordan179""> is having a public discussion with others about how I could possibly have defriended him*. It looks like the general consensus is that my delicate sensibilities are offended by his assault on Political Correctness.

Actually, it's a little more complex than that, and has to do with the ways I - and others - use this medium.

Watch this space, more commentary later. 

I will say that political discussions in and of themselves don't offend me. Political discussions with others who I am suspicious of, or who I don't know very well, aren't really my cup o' tea.

Defending my honor is probably futile, because anyone who comes to the space on his side is going to assume I am a Cookie Cutter Liberal Who Hates America, but so it goes.

*Actually, defriending him is impossible because I never friended him in the first place. Which reminds me to remember to use ""Friendslock"" on more of my posts, because they're generally not for the consumption of random strangers.""

ETA: Please don't go fling poo at him or his LJ friends on the discussion they're having. I said a few things to defend my honor, as there were a lot of unfair assumptions being made about my character, but there's no need to name-call anyone there. Go comment if you feel like it, but let's avoid any further smearing."

"event","<p>I spent the evening yesterday with a group of very sweet people who are helping my Dad - helping him rent an apartment (he&rsquo;s paying but probably couldn&rsquo;t get a lease on his own) and they were some of the only people who prayed at his bedside.</p> <p>I went to church with Mom on Sunday. There is one man in particular who was at my father&rsquo;s bedside just about every single day at the ICU. He didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;have&rdquo; to be there. No one made him go. And he has a job, so it&rsquo;s not like he wasn&rsquo;t inconvenienced. He just went and he prayed for my father. A lot of people reading this probably aren&rsquo;t religious but I do think it made a huge difference in my father&rsquo;s recovery.</p> <p>I kept trying to go up to thank him for his service. But I kept choking up and couldn&rsquo;t quite get to him to tell him what I thought.</p> <p>We were all visiting last night after Dad barbecued some steaks on the grill. Dad looks pretty good - still thin, and somewhat frail, but remarkable for someone who survived an injury that kills 99% of the people who experience it.</p> <p>And of course, the conversation turns to Obama.</p> <p>They kept pushing me to disavow him because he&rsquo;s not Christian enough or isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;real leader&rdquo; or whatever. (They WORSHIPPED W.)</p> <p>The old me would have answered them with surly hostility. Instead, I attempted to find some common ground and changed the subject with humor when it was clear they wouldn&rsquo;t agree. (Gay marriage was the other hot button issue.)</p> <p>These people aren&rsquo;t bad people. They&rsquo;ve helped my father. They&rsquo;re caring neighbors. And they also think Barack Obama is a secret Muslin terrorist who will recruit me into the Hitler Youth tomorrow.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m not sure where I&rsquo;m going with this, but this is just to say that sometimes dealing with people isn&rsquo;t so black and white.</p>"

"event","I am just doing really, really well. I'm all settled in. Butters is settled in. Mom and I have found our groove. Lauren is fantastic. Her FIRST SCHOOL DANCE EVER is coming up. Omg!&nbsp;<br /><br />Sample conversation:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Me:</strong>                     So, your first school dance, huh? I like your outfit. Who are you going with?  <br />                                     <strong>Lauren:</strong>                     [Boy in school]. <br />                                     <strong>Me:</strong>                     Oh, did he ask you out? <br />                                     <strong>Lauren:</strong>                     No, I asked him! <br />                                     <strong>Me:</strong>                     Why's that? <br />                                     <strong>Lauren:</strong> You think he'd have the guts to ask ME out! The boys in this school are chicken! You just have to make a move!<br /><br />LOL. <br /><br />Also, her twelfth birthday is coming up. She wants a <em>Twilight </em>theme and a skating party. (Don't worry, the Twihard stuff is just because she thinks werewolves are AWESOME.) As a closet ironic Twihard, I&nbsp;approve of an authorized occasion to drool over Taylor Lautner. <br /><br />Healthwise, I'm really worried about Mom. She wants to go to sleep at 7 PM every day thanks to the two nodules fucking up her thyroid. Her doc is recommending a 2-3 week leave while she gets the potentially cancerous nodules removed and gets her hormones right with an endocrinologist. As I already wrote, I'll be taking over her 6th grade science classroom while she's gone. <br /><br />Otherwise, she seems to be doing well. Her divorce is final, and she's sworn off marriage, which I&nbsp;honestly think is best for her. (She's great as a friend/girlfriend, but really has some serious, deep down self-esteem issues that cause her to gravitate towards unworthy men.) Her boyfriend seems worthy, however, and is very respectful of her. She loves her job and her friends. I've seen her sink to some pretty low bouts of depression, and she was miserable in her last marriage, so I'm happy she's single and seems to be OK with it. <br /><br />Honestly, it makes me wonder if marriage is right for ME. I know plenty of happy married people (many on LJ) but I&nbsp;worry the same issues lurk underneath the surface. It will happen if it happens, I suppose. I&nbsp;know, for SURE, that I&nbsp;definitely want a kid (and will possibly adopt or foster.) Marriage?&nbsp;Not as sure. Hmm. <br /><br />Anywayz. <br /><br />Today I finished up my required hours of observation to be my mom's substitute. Her first four classes are absolute angels - an average mix, intelligence-wise, but they're really quiet and follow directions, and what more can you ask for? Her fifth period is the advanced class, and they show it. Sixth is a free period.<br /><br />Seventh and eighth are hell on wheels. Lord help me. They're the kids from the projects and they act like they were raised by wolves/think being in gangs is 'cool'. Most of them mean well, but they're definitely not on their Best Junior High Behavior Yet. (Whatever that is!)&nbsp;<br /><br />I plan to be stern with that class and not allow any bullshit. The best part in this situation is they know I'm Ms. Delamar's daughter and will&nbsp; I immediately let her know what's going on at home if they try anything - that's a leverage most subs don't have. <br /><br />So subbing for three weeks will net me some cash. I'm awaiting a returned rental deposit, if the stereotypically Italian landlords don't try any funny business with me. (They are a walking stereotype. Their names are Vinny and Mario. They worked at a pizza joint. And demanded all the rent in cash. It was... an interesting time.) <br /><br />Annnd then I'm going to start the visa process to go to Korea for a Jan-Feb start as a private school teacher. Perhaps even a March start, because I&nbsp;do like hanging around here. As far as my keep, I'm pretty much earning it as the house-cleaner/glorified live-in nanny/cook. And it's a fun job, because my fam is awesome. <br /><br />Life is good!&nbsp;<br /><br />"

"event","So I&nbsp;will now.<br /><br />I am home, after moving out of Brooklyn and spending the weekend enjoying yummy food and the sardonic company of <lj user=""yagathai""/>&nbsp;. (I&nbsp;fucked up a bit by not appraising <lj user=""easter""/>&nbsp;, who had promised me lodging, of my plans. I will now call that idiocy the Great Jessica Fail of 2009. I think Daae will be amused by that.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The flight home was... well, a saga. It's stressing me out to think about it. <br /><br />I&nbsp;had a hard pet carrier for Butters to bring him home. was&nbsp; 9 inches tall. Unfortunately, the limit for height was 8 inches.&nbsp; I did not know this because Continental's pet policy is somewhat Byzantine, and the pet carrier model was &quot;certified airplane safe,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;so admittedly I didn't do the due diligence I&nbsp;&nbsp;should have. <br /><br />The new soft carrier cost 60 bucks. I&nbsp;had 55 bucks on me. They did not accept payments over the phone, or any alternate form of payment or a check, or a return guarantee. The payment had to be cash. <br /><br />I&nbsp;kind of had a mental breakdown. <br /><br />All is well, though. One money transfer from Dad (thank GOD) and a quick rebooking (gratis) later, I was on the plane with Butters.<br /><br />The next slapstick event happened when a sedated Butters figured out he could open the velcro tab of the soft carrier with his nose (which, granted, as already slightly open as I'd been petting him.)<br /><br />Two hours into the flight, I&nbsp;was tapped by a flight attendant.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;You have a cat, right?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Huh?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, he's made friends with the entire first class.&quot;<br /><br />Cat on a plane! Butters had not only snuck out, but he found the lap of a cute elderly couple to snuggle and be cute in - in the first class cabin. (I was in coach. He spoiled!)&nbsp;<br /><br />That was... mortifying.&nbsp; But funny.<br /><br />Now I'm home. Thanks to the largesse of a very generous male friend (whom I&nbsp;like very much - he treats my mother with dignity, respect and kindness and that's all I can ask for) - my mom's home is heavily remodeled in a way she loves. Her guy, who owns a construction company, can afford renovations gratis - it's his company!&nbsp;<br /><br />So now we have repainted walls, new bathroom fixtures like new Jacuzzi tubs, and new windows that badly needed replacing. The house looks great. It makes Mom really happy - &quot;I&nbsp;have a home I can be proud of.&quot;&nbsp; I&nbsp;think it's kind of a way for Mom to get the specter of her asshole ex-husband out of her life. The house literally seemed darker when he was around. It's a relief to just interact with Lauren and her without his asshole presence.&nbsp; Her boyfriend has his own home and business an hour away, and they &quot;visit from time to time&quot; for a couple of days. And according to Mom, &quot;That's all I&nbsp;&nbsp;need in my life right now.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yay&nbsp; seemingly stable not-crazy boyfriend!<br /><br />Healthwise, the good news is that my mom's health problem (two marble-sized throat nodules)&nbsp;is NOT cancer. However, said nodules may contain cells that could quickly metastize into an aggressive, terminal, cancer, and is causing severe side effects for her besides. So she is strongly considering removing the thyroid which may require 2-3 weeks of leave.<br /><br />She is doing OK financially, but is in some debt from the ex-husband years (long story short:&nbsp;he drained her dry. I&nbsp;&nbsp;always hated him - from day one in fact. It's really hard to not dance around singing, &quot;I&nbsp;&nbsp;told you so! Told you so!&quot;&nbsp; Petty, I&nbsp;&nbsp;know.)&nbsp;<br /><br />So being here is a relief to her - if I&nbsp;start to teach as a substitute, which I'm interested in doing for a few months, I&nbsp;can help put food on the table. And pay my own considerable debt from personal loans, student loans, and simply&nbsp; stupid financial decisions I made in college. (Never again!)<br /><br />Mom actually asked me to take over her 6th grade science class if she does end up taking that long a leave. I've... I've never felt more honored.<br /><br />Frankly, it's good to be home. I was Lauren's &quot;parent&quot; at her 6th grade Open House tonight, because Mom had to talk to parents herself. It made me sentimental because I was in 6th grade when she was born. She's grown up so much!&nbsp;She's taking up trombone - my instrument - to be &quot;just like you, Jessica&quot; (her words.) Unlike me, she's a math and science whiz (I was always an English girl)&nbsp;and she signed up for science and math academic competitions through UIL, Texas' public school competitive body. <br /><br />She's just a cool kid. Not as much of a reader as I&nbsp;was, but she'll watch Discovery Channel and National Geographic for hours and absorb every word. She's thoughtful - she'll make breakfast for Mom and cook dinner if Mom's tired. She's interested in everything around her and asks me about history, politics, and art. She's a bit of a nerd and a bit of a popular kid at the same time. Dances to the beat of her own drum, that girl. <br /><br />I'm just really proud to be her big sis. And happy to be home. That's all. :)&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />"

Whether or not you agree MJ is worthy of mourning, his child's utter grief is heart-wrenching. I'm kind of choking back tears."

I expect some jokes about how they&rsquo;re &ldquo;slumming&rdquo; it since everyone knows rich white people live in Manhattan, not Brooklyn! Lollerskates! I bet they&rsquo;ll deal with &ldquo;edgy&rdquo; topics like stroller envy!<br /><br />Manhattan has already dealt with the influx of Sex and the City wannabes. Now they're coming to Brooklyn?

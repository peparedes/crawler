"event","Pushed into a journal entry after my amazing LFO entry. That's fine, some people just can't appreciate the soothing sounds of LFO. It's an aquired taste.

Anyway, summer's here. Flowers are bloomed, sun's shining (kinda), the OCs on reruns, and I'm sitting on my thumb all day. Shits wack as fuck lately. All I do is work out then come home. I love being at practice but really by the tim i get home ppl havnt even woken up yet. Pisses the fuck outta me but I manage to get by. The really cool people are online when I'm bored and talk to me. The extremely chill ppln actually call me. The dope trillin people come over and give me company. You all know who you are. SHOW ME SOME LOVE!

Summer has been pretty boring besides the few pople who keep me from sleeping all day. Marshal, Jordan, Criag, Steven, Michelle, and Willy have been over lately, been getting closer to the team (wow get off,) and I continue bumming rides due to my grounding (o yea, you didnt hear? I actually got grounded this time for grades, the only time I dont make a post about it I get grounded. fucking bad luck.)

Cruise coming up on the 26th. Excited for crazy white bitches... I mean... Crazy tourist bitches... yea... mmm tourists...

<u><b>And now for my classic rant:</b></u>

As I get older, greyer and wiser, I like to take time to reflect on the epic journeys I've been on, to remember the strange and wonderful places I've seen, and to chase those damn kids off my lawn. You young whippersnappers! Anyhow, I realized that even with my vast corporate holdings, advanced technology and unlimited scientific knowledge, I've still never been to the end of the universe. So I went on a little road trip this week and decided to see what all the hoopla was about. It took me 16 billion anti-light years to get there, which you might think is a long time, but it's not. It's a long anti-time. It was pretty disappointing though. Just a bunch of old photons from back when time had started, chasing younger photons off their lawns. There wasn't even a place to get a drink, except that restaurant everyone talks about, and they were out of Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters. Then my van broke down, so I gave the whole thing up and came home. Yes, my van. What did you think, I was going to walk? The bright side is that I also got bored on the way back, so I madea new LJ Entry. I posted it form the future, so it should be there by now.

C'mon.. (na na na na)
I said lets talk about it as she walked out on me and slammed the door
But I just laugh about it 'cause she's always playin' those games...(C'mon)
<b>Deep down I know she loves me, but she got a funny way of showin' me
how she cares (she cares)</b>
Last night she did a doughnut on my lawn
and <i>drove off with one finger in the air</i> (oh yeah)

Sometimes it's black, sometimes it's white,
Sometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right,
<b>Sometimes we talk about it and we figure it out,
but then she just changed her mind</b>
Sometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold
<b>Sometimes my head wants to explode,
but when I think about it, I'm so in love with her
<i>Every other time</i></b>
Yeah, every other time
(na na na na)

Sometimes we sit around just the two of us on a park bench
Sometimes we swim around like two dolphins in the ocean of our hearts
<b>But then I think about the time when we broke up after the prom</b>
and you told everyone that I was gay...ok
Sometimes I walk around the town for hours just to settle down
<b>but I take you back and you kick me down
'Cause that's the way uh-huh uh-huh <i>I like it.</i></b>

<i>Keep it up homegirl don't you quit</i>
You know the way you scream is the ultimate
And <b>when I walk away just watch the clock
I bet I don't even get around the block</b>
I said let's talk about it as she walked out on me and slammed the door
<i>One day we'll laugh about it</i>, <b>'cause we're always playin' those games</b>
(na na na na na, na na n- every o- every other time...)

So now I need to find a ride to the Metro Station. Maybe Chris will take me home. I'm too tired so all I'm going to write are sentence fragments. K? K! My legs aren't functioning too well and today we run. I love this idea of waking up early. It's great. Whatever I'm going to go and fall asleep standing up before I cramp up.

EDIT: Left the house at 6:05 and got to practice at 6:15. That's 10 minutes from 12th ave and 8th street to 127th ave and 8th street. Who's a bad ass?"

The God is here. He's here to stay. So many have been complaining that I've been slacking lately with my LJ. I give all of you one big sorry and lick/blowjob. I'll fulfill your LJ needs from now on. Well, now on to business...

Summer... O dear summer. You have been so dull. I want to suffocate you for making this the most boring beggining of summer yet. Atleast I got football. Waking up at 5am and getting practicing at 6:15am. Feels good but really murders the fuck out of my hot sexy nights. But that's fine, I'll find pleasure and entertainment through out the time I'm awake. Usually I fucking sleep till 1 or 2 in the afternoon. Not anymore, by then I'm actually getting ready for work. Yep, lazy ass Josh got off his ass and grabbed a job. I'm working at the EB Games over at bayside. Shits chill, pays average but its really chill. Just what I needed.

I've been waking up at 5am every day now for football practice again. Shits murder. Yet it feels nice to work out before everyone wakes up. Leaves the rest of the day free."

Anyway, Marco was very overrated, but thankfully my room was the hit of Marco. I rented two rooms, and threw 3 parties in 3 nights. Everyone kept coming and going. Didn't know who the fuck they were, nor did I care. I have about one picture of the last party (only time I was sober enough to use a camera.) I took 98 pictures in total from the weekend. But only a couple can be posted due to some law about underage something... Whatever I forget the law. All I know is it's illegal. Fucking ey, man.

Well, imagine my sarcasm x10, and then throw in about 1/2 the randomness that is me, and you have my brother. He is such a beautiful person but very wierd in his very own way. Altough I am as unique as it comes, my brother gets his own category.

He can be serious:

I fell asleep on the 88th question of my 200 question Art History final. I saw Marshall get up and turn in the test when I woke up at 9:30am. So I guessed the rest and turned it in. Fuck you, Gerry.

On a lighter note: Star Wars Episode III opened today. My inner nerd is crying for a taste. But probably wont get it's fix until the weekend or next week. :(

"event","Weekend was pretty amazing. Turned into one night at the beach to an entire weekend that we can call ""Pre-Marco."" Not that I'm excited for Marco or anything (bc its the same shit every year,) but yea it felt like a mini-Marco Island. Whatever. Funny thing was this was supposed to be a celebration for Michelle's graduation, but we turned into our own celebration. 

Me, Mark, Steven, and Bryan rode over the the beach with a duffle bag of liquor just for fun. Didn't think the night would be fun but whatever. We meet up in Nicolle's room and we begin the festivities. As soon as we started getting faded we headed down to the beach and then the prom let out shit got ridiculous. Bon fires, fireworks, everyone hooking up, even people that said they wouldn't hook up went ahead and did it anyways. Those fucking liars ;) . It felt like I was in the middle of Woodstock... Except without the rapes and shit. Actually, maybe there was a rape, I don't know I was too ripped to notice. Saturday I refused to drink, so I watched all the bad influences take body shots and relayed the good news to Michelle bc she wasn't able to attend that night. (Sorry for the lack of&nbsp; details but if I get into specifics I'd make alot of enemies. Ah fuck it, I'll do it anyways.)

Sunday came and we went to the beach. Ate shit, played Volleyball and Frisbee. I dove for everything thing even when it was unecessary. I broke 3 ribs and my shoulder was dislocated, but hey... atleast I didn't get AIDS. o_0???

I have no pictures but I'm sure everyone else does, so I'll bum some off of them later.

This week is going to be wierd. I start finals on thurday and am planning on failing bc Art History is a waste and the credits are worthless. Basically: fuck you, Gerry. Then is english and I'm going to rape alexander on his fucking exam. The retard just copy and pasted tests to gether. Then the next week will be a blur.

Marco's coming and I'm mildy excited. I'll probably stay sober and look for a fight like I usually do bc I'm hardcore. As a back up plan I'll make sure to bring some entertainment. aka NIGGAZ!

She say that she still wants a friendship
She can't live her life without me as a friend
I can't figure out why I give a damn to what she wants
I don't understand the now before the then
Most of this garbage I write that these people seem to like
Is about you and how I let you infect my life
And if they got to know you, I doubt that they would see it
They'd wonder what I showed you how you could leave it
A friend in Chicago said that I should stay persistent
If I stay around I'm bound to break resistance
<b>Fuck you</b> Lucy for defining my existence
<b>Fuck you</b> and your differences
Ever since I was a young lad with a part-time dad
It was hard to find happiness inside of what I had
I studied my mother, I digested her pain
And vowed no women on my path would have to walk the same
Travel like sound across the fate ladder
I travel with spoon to mix this cake batter
And I travel with feel, so I can with touch
It's like that, thank you very much, <b>fuck you very much!</b>

Fuck the <i>'what happened?'</i> I got stuck
They can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck
Used to walk with luck, used to hold her hand
Fell behind and played the role of a slower man
I want to stand on top of this mountain and yell
I want to wake up and break up this lake of hell
I feel like a <i>bitch</i> for letting the sheet twist me up
The last starfighter was wounded, time to give it up
On a pick it up mission, kept it bitter
Gettin' in a million memories just to forget her
The difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled
Cookies for the road, took me by the soul
Hunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture
Gonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder
Interpret the eyes, read the lines on her face
The sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?
<b>Fuck you</b> Lucy for leaving me
<b>Fuck you</b> Lucy for not needing me

That's all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left
And save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning

But the problem is I love you Lucy
So instead I'ma finish my drink and have another

"event","How many times have you heard the phrase ""nice guys finish last"" ? You probably can't even count how many times you've heard some frustrated guy say this. You might even say this yourself quite frequently. So, what is it about ""Nice Guys"" that cause their hearts to get stomped on by women and people in general? I'm going to help explain this as clearly as possible.

First, it is NOT the fact that a guy is ""nice"" that makes him unattractive to women. Being nice is a great personality trait and there's nothing wrong with being a nice person. So many men are under the impression that they were ""too nice"" and that's why they got stomped on and stepped over. Wrong !

<u><b>No more Mr. Nice Guy</b></u>

The first and most crucial mistake a guy can make is to lie to himself about the REAL reason that woman got scared off. Most of the time he is just too needy and attempts to build his entire existence and happiness around being with her. Guys...this is TOO MUCH pressure and feels suffocating. Men don't like overly needy women and women don't like overly needy men. So, how do you avoid turning into a clump of belly button lint stuck in some woman's navel? Simple...do NOT build your life around her or anyone else, for that matter. Have your own interests and activities. Build a happy and healthy life for yourself so that when you do find a good woman she compliments the good life you already have rather than creates or completes your life. Every good and quality relationship includes time away from each other and room for each person to be an individual as well as part of a couple.

Another mistake so many nice guys make is to devote all of their time into doing things for other people to the point where they aren't taking care of themselves. Learn to say no when you need or want to say it. It's okay to put your own needs and wants ahead of doing things for others that they could do for themselves. If you don't take care of yourself first you won't be worth a damn to anyone else. How can you be there for that woman in your life if you don't see to your own needs first? You can't.

Love is a wonderful thing, and it's a precious gift you can give to other people. However, most importantly, you MUST love yourself first. Until you can genuinely love yourself you can't love another person in a healthy way. So many ""nice guys"" mistakenly believe that if they worship the ground a woman walks on and idolizes her that she will automatically return the same treatment towards him. These are what I like to call ""Unrealistic Expectations"". More often than not, these kinds of expectations go unmet and lead to pain, frustration and sometimes anger. These expectations are nothing more than premeditated resentments. This isn't healthy behavior and what it boils down to is a heavy dose of self inflicted suffering. Never set yourself up for this kind of disappointment. Treat yourself better than this.

Finally...if a man spends all of his time catering to the whims of others, how can he find the time to have a full and rich life? He can't, and his life is spent helping others to make their lives more interesting while his life becomes more and more dull and boring. He has little energy left for his own adventures and excitement and his love life suffers as a result. Women don't like boredom and stagnation.

<b>The mistakes nice guys make are

*Being too needy
*Unrealistic Expectations/Premeditated Resentments
*Idolizing a woman
*Living for everyone else but himself and becoming dull
*Making his happiness and existence too dependent on his relationships with others</b>

If you recognize your own behavior in this list, you have probably blamed your ""niceness"" for hindering your relationships with women. Hopefully this article will help you to see and understand exactly where the problem is and what you need to do to fix it.

<b>Here are a few things you can start doing right away to help you to stop making this mistakes with women.

*Start saying ""No"" when you don't want to do someone a favor. ""Sorry, I can't"" is just as easy to say, and the world won't stop turning if you say no.

*Go spend some time with and on yourself...make your life exciting and interesting. Do things you enjoy just because you enjoy it. You deserve this! It's YOUR life!

*Don't worship women. They are human, make mistakes and aren't perfect. They are just like you for the most part, and are no better or worse than you are. Don't treat them like they deserve more than you do. If you don't respect yourself women won't respect you either.

*You ""need"" food and water. You ""need"" shelter. You don't ""need"" any specific person to create your happiness and make you ""somebody"". If you feel like you ""need"" someone else to be happy then your feelings towards that person are NOT healthy. It's healthy to ""want"" someone to compliment who you ALREADY are, but NOT to ""need"" someone to define or complete you.</b> 

In conclusion ... <u><b>don't lose the niceness, lose the neediness.</b></u>

On a lighter note: I ordered Dominos American Cheeseburger Pizza. That shit is so hot when ordered with no tomatoes and onions. The perfect <b>munchies</b> food. ;)"

Those born on the sixth are more apt to be open and honest with everyone, and more caring about family and friends, too. 

This is a number associated with responsibility and caring - this birthday lends a degree of concern for others.</td>

"event","Isn't today that day that everyone who hates Mexicans go and get really drunk with Mexicans making pretend to like them just so that can steal their tequila? Isn't that what El Cinco de Mayo is all about? Hiring mariachis to come over to your house while they expect a party and its actually just you there sitting alone withe a stack of burritos and tacos ready to listen to your favorite Mexican Samba.

Well in actuality today is the day Mexico celebrates their freedom. Not that I care, considering I think Mexicans smell (no offense, just i dont like the smell of chicken tacos and garden tools.) Ahhh, you all know I'm just joking. <b>I <3 Mexicans.</b>

"event","Ha, I've been so occupied with random shit that I almost forgot to update about the prom and my afterparty (yeah, I threw a party...)

Basically, prom was fun, everyone fucking danced for the first time, its pretty funny. People I didn't expect knew how to move their feet went and danced. It was really entertaining to to see some really stupid shit, like Jordan falling and breaking his watch, watching Correoso dance (I don't know why I found it funny, but it was a something that will be engraved in my mind forever...), and also the lovely styles of Marshall.

The prom finished and we headed out to my house. So many people showed up and made this party so chill. People were either just laying out back or shilling inside with drink in their hand and their date in their arms. Or if they were me thay had Hptoniq in their hands and a gallon of Vodka in their system. From the moment I got back into my house at 2:30 I didn't remember a thing after. Only in small blurs. So much fun. Anthony got a little too drunk and threw a chair across my yard. Other than that everyone else was chill. I fell over a bit too many times. Woke up with a huge hangover. <i>Moved on</i> when Monday came.

Such fun times to come. :)"

Basically, what you meant to say was ""I'm over you; go away."" I used that excuse when I was in 5th grade. Kind of an insult that you would even think I can believe that. There must of been a certain reason why we fell apart. Or a certain person...

Prom is tonight. I'm mildly looking forward to it. 

I don't know whats wrong with me lately, but I've completly given up on everything. If something turns out bad I just won't care. I won't attempt to fix it or to find out what was wrong... I just don't care anymore. Everything can fall all part in my life right now for all I care. Yea, sure... of course I don't want that to happen, but if it were to happen I would seriously consider joining the military just to get away from my life. I might soung like I hate life right now, but the truth is I love it and everything about it. The thing that's making me feel like this is the fact that nothing lasts forever, no matter if its good or bad... it will eventually fade to black. You might want that for bad situations, but you will never want that for good ones. You want the good times to last forever, but deep down inside you know that is impossible and that you will eventually get hurt. Fuck, I'm just talking out of my ass. What the fuck do I know?

Jesus, just please let tonight be something that I can remember forever. Something that I don't ever want to end. Something that I can enjoy so fun with my friends. Something I can share so beautifully with my love. Something that <b>I</b> can't complain about...

So, Marshall took Roque and I to the regional track meet... Heh, ""meat."" As in ""penis."" Heh... *shake's off the perverted-ness* Anyway, a bunch of the team placed in states. Me and Marshall then left to his house so he can get dressed and we rode out to that party on sunset. It was pretty good, figuring that there was nothing else to do and every one in the private school syndicate was there.

Later, we all (Me, Marshall, Ian, Brolley, Navarro, Eric, and C.A.'s brother Mark) headed out to Krispy Kream. It's like sex with your mouth those donuts, I tell you! Now I'm home planning out future shit with Bryan.

Tomorrow is the NFL Draft! OH BOY!!! Me, Marshall, Roque, Brolley, etc... are all going to an undisclosed location. If you want to meet us call my cell. Make sure you're cool first. We don't want to abandon this place like we had to do with Dave & Busters. :( After, I'm going to Michelle's for a rowdy as fuck Lebanese feast. My mommy's cooking. Everyone's gonna be there and I <b><i>FINALLY</i></b> get to see my love.

"event","Well, this is going to probably (I'm serious this time) be the last weekend I'll see until finals are over. Fuck grades suck again. I've got the worst case of senior-itis even though I'm a fucking junior. I don't even open my bag anymore when I get home. I just get home, workout, shower, AIM, talk on the phone, sleep. Every.Single.Night. Shit never gets boring, though.

Remember when I said I'm horrible at cheating? Well it showed up again. Today I aqquired a cheat sheet, and I copied all the answers wrong. Yep, that's called being retarded. I walked out so confidently, until I realized there were only 30 questions on the test, and I answered 46. :(

I don't think I'm gonna show up to school tomorrow. Since my grades come out on Monday this means that this is my last weekend of freedom. So, why not make it a long weekend? I think Mark's gonna pick my ass up tomorrow after he gets outta work and we'll go get lost somewhere.

So today I was at the track meet 6th and 7th period (fuck a nigga named class) and I watched the meet. Some girl that was doing hurdles from St. Brendan decided to free ball under her track shorts... or free cooch... =\&nbsp;  It was amusing when we all pointed and laughed at her when she walked back to her team. Some other bitch fucking ate it jumping the hurdles, I also pointed and laughed, but this time people called me an asshole.

Speaking of calling me an asshole... Michelle... :) You know I only play around, I never get mad. <33

Saturday I'm passing up a huge mansion party, but it's ok. Mansion's are overrated. 15's are where the parties are at.

Here's a thought: Have any of you ever tried to talk in lyrics? Like you know, when you memorized the lyrics to a song you try to use those lyrics in a conversation w/o singing them. Like let's say some guy is talking shit to you... Do you wanna sound generic and say, ""WTF?"" Or would you like to sound like T.I. (very cool) and say, ""Save all the hatin' and the poppin', nigga you don't know me."" I'd go with the latter.

Oh yea, and too complete my random thought essay, here's an amazing new trend called ""stealing celebrities cell phones and then hacking into their naked pictures so that horny teenagers and old men can jerk off to their pictures while they save them on their harddrive and then pass them around to all their perverted buddies."" They stold Paris Hilton's phone. Now they stole Vida Guerra's. The hottest woman on the face of the earth. Well, besides my girlfriend. ;)

Friday I went to Michelles <33 . It was our 3 month. I attempted to bake a cake just so that I can lick the batter inside the bowl. We followed all the instructions, but it still came out fucking horrible. I can truthfully blame it on Michelle, bc it is ALWAYS her fault... ;)&nbsp;  I then realized I didn't bring a movie, so we were left with nothing other than the TV. It was a fun night. Always memorable.

Saturday was boring as hell until Mark picked my ass up and we went to Moe's. We ate, almost ran over 3 people and went home. We started getting dressed for our music video rendering of ""U ALREADY KNOW"" by 112. We were planning it well until Michelle and Evelyn got there. Distractions. Well, atleast Michelle was. Fucking pervert. Wanting us to make a porno. After the video we made another one with ""SOME CUT."" It was as close as you can get to a porno w/o it actually being one.

That night we all ended up at the grove. Me, Michelle, Mark, Nicolle, Natasha, Mel, Evelyn, Andrew, and Kevin. We ate at Hooters, made some observations. We watched Fever Pitch and it was horrible. Anyway, I'm on my way to Michelle's now for a BBQ. Ill finish this up later.

Ok back... I TOLD YOU WE'D HAVE FUN, MICHELLE!!! It was very chill. Natasha got dressed up in Marks Black Tee and she looked so natural. We learned how to Irish Step-Dance. Mark taught Michelle how to step-dance after me and Mark re-enacted our Some Cut video. We laughed, we cried, me and Michelle tricked people. Very, very, smart person to come up with <i>that</i> joke. Haha!

Now I'm going to throw in one of my random stories:

Have you ever had a job interview where people ask you questions like, ""Describe your weaknesses"", or ""What are three words that describe you?"".  I have.  Apparently the correct answer is not ""awesome"", ""seriously awesome"", and ""magnificent"".  I figured later that they probably didn't like the answer because that was actually four words.  That's ok, who really needs a Vice President of Everything position at some multi-national corporation anyway.  They were probably just looking for a patsy to take the fall for their accounting anyway.  I mean, who wouldn't hire somebody that is awesome, not to mention seriously awesome?  Even if I did list my major weakness as ""working"".  I'm still awesome.  Seriously."

I'm driving back home and there are these circles in the middle of the intersections in my neighborhood that we have to go around. There is a yield sign for those cars approaching the circles. I'm driving around the circles and out of nowhere a dominoes delivery guy speeds through the circle and ignores the yield sign. The motherfucker almost hits me. I beep the horn and scream out the window (half-thuggish), ""WTF, NIGGA?! YOU GOTTA YIELD!!!"" He stops the car in the middle of the road and gets out all hardcore looking and shit. He points at me and says, ""THE FUCK YOU TALKING TO?!"" I'm like wow, this fag really wants to fight me... So I boost the volume of the radio and jump out of the car. I swear... by coincidence, Knuck If You Buck was playing. Wiiiiieeeerd. I look at him and he's approximately 5 foot 6 or 5 foot 8, I couldn't make it out he was about 10 yards in front of me. I give him a hard stare and ask him normally (yet still semi-thuggish), ""So, what'chu wanna do, dog?""

I'm already clenching my fists read for him to charge, but he either realized that his pizza was getting cold or that I was about four inches taller than him and was able to rip his throat out of the back of his head and looks at me and then at the sign and says, ""Oh, may bad. I didn't see the sign."" He then promptly jumps in his car and speeds off. I'm left there fucking thinking... ""WTF just happened?!"" I then can't stop laughing in the middle of the road and get back into my car. Drive home and write it in here. Wow...

And who brought you the news that Elvis was alive in a hotel in Kansas City, but was being kept prisoner by aliens that had cloned Hilary Clinton? Well, that was probably the Enquirer, but it could have been me. I'm a bit fuzzy on that one. But in keeping with my strong devotion to public service and enlightenment, I'd like to remind you to set your clocks forward this Sunday.

Yesterday was pretty fucked up in alotta ways. I didn't know how to deal with any of it so I just decided to fall asleep early. Atleast I solved one problem. The other ones aren't as important, but still need to be solved. I felt normal yesterday... Today, <b>WILL</b> be a good day. Haha.

Anyways, shits been pretty <b>random</b> lately. Just the way like it. <b>(I SMELL A RANDOM STORY COMING!!!!)</b> 

Making the most of a crappy situation is my motto. (Actually, this is my secondary motto.&nbsp; My real motto is top secret, contains hydroflouric acid, and has been known to attract elephants.) So when I realized that I was being punished by primal forces of nature and there was nothing I could do about it, I decided that at least I should have some fun.&nbsp; Yes, I'm talking about static electricity.&nbsp; Not just regular 'ol shuffle-your-feet-on-the-carpet-and-touch-your-friend warm and fuzzy static electricity, I mean the blue spark flyin', every hair on your body is receiving a different television channel, o-m-g-the-cat-is-stuck-to-the-ceiling kind of static electricity.&nbsp; Seriously, he's up there.

Anyways, I'm making the most of it.&nbsp; I've managed to set up enough wire along my hallway to amplify the field to such a level that I can accelerate charged objects through it and out the front door at surprising velocities.&nbsp; My brother wandered into it, but don't worry, since he was on the roof he was just propelled into the doorjamb and didn't get outside.

So that and a few drinks is keeping me down to earth this week. I've been mixing dark Puerto Rican Rum with Triple Sec Vodka, a bit of Cranberry Juice, and alotta ICE! Shit's fiiiiire. I call it the Mighty RCT.

"event","If you've had as tough a week as I have, then you deserve to read this shit. I came to the realization that pretty quick here I'm going to have to stop procrastinating and get to work on SATs.&nbsp; That wouldn't be so bad, except I'm WAY better at procrastinating than I am at SATs. Just look at that squirrel outside. He's pretty cute. Maybe I should go feed him, he looks kind of hungry.&nbsp; Aww, poor little guy.&nbsp; Hang on, what was I doing?&nbsp; Oh yeah, liquor. Anyways, my week got even tougher when I realized that I also blew all of my money on liquor to develop a 2nd liver. I came close, but my other liver died, and it kept spilling the liquor into the inside of my body.&nbsp; Also, after too much vodka synthesization, I started getting sluggish and unpredictable, and kept sending out emails to ex-girlfriends.&nbsp; Since I have no money left to buy more liquor, I was faced with the tough decision of either lying to the liquor store clerk, or attempting one last test of my SAT book.&nbsp; Fortunately, I really don't like lying, and I also really don't like the SAT books.&nbsp; So enjoy this entry, I'm very distracted.

Tonight we went to the Knife. Very overrated. I don't recommend that shit for no one. We had alot of steak. Alot. ALOT. Of course... you know me. I can't stand restaurants I get all quiet and shit, confined to the rules that are presented at the door. Once I walk through those doors I always get quiet. It's like walking into a fucking chruch. W.e. I eat quietly and watch everyone eat shit. Like a;ways I feel left out but that's because I don't attempt to talk to anyone. Inside jokes lay ahed.... WARNING: Bleeding steak... MOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Messy table. alot more, Melissa will tell me the rest. Here it is:

"event","Well everything has been amazing lately. I'm loving life so much... and Michelle. ;)

I get back from New York and guess whos there to pick me up? Yep, it's Michelle! Dope ride home. Next day I went out and bought so much liquor. 5 Six packs of random Smirnoff and Bacardi shit, and 3 Quartz of Smirnoff and Bacardi. It's just party shit. Now for out first weekly ""insert food-name here"" Party. We had a Hotdog Party, it was pretty nice. Michelle came and brought Anne with her then Natasha showed up. Later, Manoach and Marshall and Jordan passed by. Bryan Showed up, then the 3 D's. Danny Garrcia, Danny Noste, and D-Rod. Everyone left finally and it was just back to normal again. We all bonded. Scared the fuck out of some of of Michelle's friends, it was all in good fun. Night ends and next day comes.

We go to Monty's around 4 or something. It was a great day to sexcersize! :) lol We ended up at bayside with teh Caraballo's and the Chavez's and we bought this book that taught us how to be hippies. Melissa got some good ideas. We then went onto a Paty boat. Worst.Thing.Ever. It was freezing, and boring, and I was falling asleep. W.e. Dope car ride home. We dropped off Michelle and Steven and their family. We then dragged our assed to La Carreta with the Caraballo's. So tired. But it got pretty stupid/funny. Mario ordered two CORQUETAS. I spelled it wrong on purpose bc thats how mario said it... Haha me and melissa have accepted eachother as cousins... ILLLL MY BROTHER!!! Haha, w.e. End.

School was w.e. I donated blood, and watched a Volleball game. Bryan's car got keyed again. It's funny because now we <b>HAVE</b> beat the fuck out of someone. I was so hoping to just ride it out and not hurt anybody. Oh, well. I guess the monkey has it coming. Here's a photo rendering of what will probably happen:

"event","I'm out to New York after 2nd period on Tuesday. New York, my second favorite place on earth, right behind my 1st favorite place on earth (the liquor store on the corner that doesn't card me.) I'll be there for 4 days, I get back on Friday, late as fuck, like almost 12.

I'll be with a real interesting group, Chris Gonzalez, Ray Rufat, Me (the bad influence,) and the last minute man Frankie Ponce de Leon. I hope to go to China Town and buy endless amounts of cheap imitations and hand them out to friends and special people while I swear to them they are real.

Man, this shit's gonna be so unpredictable. Such high expectations.

Welcome me home with open arms, bitches."

"event","Today is Michelle's special day... Just think, 15 years and 9 months ago today she was nothing but sperm. Just one of her dad's little sperms swimming around. Haha, but today shes here and older.

Special day, we all went to Cheesecake Factory (Michelle, Me, Anne, Melissa, Natasha, Evelyn, Steven, and Willy). I think the burgers got me sick, but I definately felt better when I got out of the restaraunt. We went down and saw this old guy dancing with his cane making pretend it was a sax or guitar or something... We kept walking around and had a really good time. Haha, those glowing stars. Night was unforgettable.

We started to drive home, and got soo crunk. Put yo' sign in his face, gang sign in his face! Natasha got a little X-Rated on the car ride to Melissa's house. ""WHIP IT OUT!!!!"" Good times.

Happy Birthday, Michelle!"

"event","Delicious hotdogs will rain from the heavens and solve world hunger... one day. Until then, there will be my world famous hot dog parties. Every weekend I'll invite a select few of well rounded friends to come and share the pleasure of eating hotdogs with me. Unfortunately, this weekend's hotdog party was planned and set for today at noon, but no one took me serioulsy. They'll know better next time. ;)

Friday was pretty much a joke, but I enjoyed myself around the time my nipple froze off and I couldnt feel any of my arms or legs. Me, Mark, Bryan, Joe, Marshall, Roque, Ian, Bofill, Johnny, and Javi went to Drenched over at the Bayside Hut. Had a little trouble at the beggining, but that was solved with a quick talk with Alex. I was introduced to more people from Gawdrock. Pretty straight. I walked myself to the front of the line like I was important or something. What fools to let me skip them. Night got cold, we got wet, people got sick, bryan got a flat tire, we fell asleep in the cold with our wet clothes on, and then finally me and Mark got home to Marshall at the door in his boxers. 

We woke up on Saturday and chilled with our thumbs in our asses while we kept asking eachother what we're gonna do today. The all of a sudden me and Mark clicked and decided to throw a party... Steaks and Beer. The <b>only</b> way to throw a party. We invited Michelle, Evelyn, and Natasha over. Willy came over later, too. We downed 3 6 packs of Smirnoff Twizted Watermelon, and Smirnoff Triple Black. Then two 12 packs of Amstel light. We got crunker than Lil' Scrappy over a recycled beat. Michelle got a bit.... <i>inarticulate</i> (she started slurring her words...lol) We ended the night in my room. People had sex, someone got naked, Michelle nailed me in the nuts so hard I couldn't breathe. I have <i>never</i> been hit so hard in my life. <b>EVER!</b> She didn't even say sorry. :( Then later she stuck me in the face. Once again, I couldn't breathe. Goddamnit that hurt, too! I told everyone to come over for a hotdog party and everyone said yes, but no one showed up the next day. Whatever!

We woke up and waited, and then moved on and headed over to Miracle Mile. There was a festival. A festival is a gathering of witches and wizards with the sole intentions of strengthening... ah you read the convo:

<b>XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: helloo melon
DrastikMeasurez9: lolol wtf, melon?
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: :-P
DrastikMeasurez9: :-D festival?
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: r u asking if i'm going?
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: lolol 
DrastikMeasurez9: no im asking for you to define it and then use it in a sentence
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: ookkk... festival.. big gathering of witches
DrastikMeasurez9: ...witches <i>and wizards</i>
DrastikMeasurez9: now the sentence...
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: we must attend the festival in salem.. to make our powers stronger.. 
DrastikMeasurez9: lmao
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: then u must teach mme how to fly
DrastikMeasurez9: i dont know how to fly
DrastikMeasurez9: :-\
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: we will learn..
DrastikMeasurez9: one day
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: yesss
DrastikMeasurez9: one day the stars and planets will align and our powers will strengthen enough to lift us off the ground
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX (1:14:56 PM): omg.. it all sounds soo exciting
DrastikMeasurez9: for real
XtOOcuTE 4yOaZzX: 8-)
DrastikMeasurez9: :-D</b>

The whole day at the festival definately wasn't a waste. It was really fun if you had to right people to hang out with. :) I'll get pictures up later of the dancing old man and of Mark's art work. I found my new car! Pontiac G6 GT. Beautiful. I mean, atleast I'll look beautiful in it. We got kicked out of a H2 Hummer. Very stupid... Then we headed out to Barnes and Nobles to use the bathroom but they smelled like vomit, so no one went in. I found a book (it was by accident, I swear!) called ""Ultimate Gay Sex."" I showed it to the girls as a joke, then my intentions were to put it away, but NOOOOO! Nicolle decides that she wants to read it with everyone! O god... Those images will forever be burned in my head. Wow, Nicolle... Just, WOW! Then we had to leave, and I invited everyone over, but of course everyone just laughed at walked away. 

Really great weekend. The best things in life are just unexpected and unplanned. Haha. ( <font color=""#000000"">Oh man, I still love her.</font> ) Let's all do this shit again! Everyone just needs to get crunker than the crunkest. But of course no one can, because I am the crunkest, and no bitch ass nigga can take that title away from me. 

<strike>Cuz I'm the people's champ.</strike>"

A few of the things I did today. Also, my favorite I might add, was that I threw a small log for a giant dog and it made his day that someone played with him. It was cute. 

I love. So wonderful And this person, I freaking adore Maybe you'll see this the first time?

I am laying in my bed; alone. Nothing on but my skivvies! Boy it's nice. Nice to just be. Be warm and cool at the same time. Fan + a summer night = lovely combination..


........



So, I'm here. And I can sense great things getting closer. It's the weeks prior that very nearly drive me mad. Sitting. Waiting. Wishing. Fantasizing about what could happen. It's very love-hate type thing. hA. Funny... when anticipation is running high, nothing ever happens. So, I keep myself stocked up on pot and ciggs. Just a couple of things to pass the time more efficiently... between now and the end of my days really.... huh.



I have very nearly lost my mind waiting to feel your hand in mine. Since the day I was born, I've craved to be turned inside out by your caress. And now, I find I've missed out; wasted my days waiting for the man I had only pictured in my head... and not the one who stood before me so long ago and confessed his love.

"event","This relationship sucks. I feel like I have gotten caught up in a vicious cycle. We never do anything fun. I've gained 20 pounds because the only thing available to eat when I come over is fucking cheesburgers. We lay in bed all the time. Waste the day. Get fat. Then we get up and fight, get drunk(sometimes). This is not what I want. He never wants to go do anything. There's never any money to go out and do anything. I cannot understand why I hang around for this. Something, someone. Please give me a push! Give me the balls to end it once and for all!!!! I cannot take this anymore! My health is suffering. My self esteem is suffering. I do not enjoy it anymore!!!!

"event","so many thoughts right now. i suppose i will begin with new years eve. it was amazing to say the least. my friend chase picked me up at home around 11:30 and we headed to winston-salem. we met up with some guys at school and discussed plans. we all decided to go climb the tallest building on campus and hang out on the roof. it was quite an adventure. it wasn't as easy as i thought it was going to be just because of pipes, ledges, ladders, steep rooves, etc. anyway, we got to the top and the view was great. we sat there for a few hours and shared a bottle of champagne. who knows how much later, it was getting pretty cold so we decided to leave. getting down was interesting. never attempt to get off of very tall buildings while intoxicated. BAD IDEA. chase and i drove off to find food. cookout was open, so we ate there. cheese fries. mmm. after that we went to this guys house and crashed. it was a very fun night. i got home today around 1:00 pm looking pretty hoboesque with a 40 oz in hand. my mom was in the kitchen waiting for me. i told her about my adventures and all was well. she left soon after and i finished my supply. adrienne came over and we talked about our evenings and stuff. she left a couple hours later and i went to sleep. that was my night/day. fun fun.


tomorrow i have to go to school and pack all of my stuff at school. i am really sad about leaving. i want to cry everytime i think about it. i hope i am making the right choice. this is a lot harder than i thought it was going to be. so much shit here at home.... i hate it. i'm always being yelled at. always being told that i never put any effort into anything. always being told that i am using my parents... having an attitude, etc. fuck them. i'm not using them. i dont want to. that would make me a worthless shithead and i am definitely not that. not even close. i have til the end of the month to find a job or i have to leave home or join the military. fair enough. military is out of the question. and if i dont get any of the jobs i have applied for, i guess i would be considered homeless. 

my heart feels like it is being pulled and twisted in the most painful way i have ever felt. it's hard to take. it's so hard to get through the day without breaking down because you want something you can't have. i hate this."

me: hi.
mom: hi. we need to talk. 
me: go ahead. 
mom: well, i cant talk to you right now about it. you need to be here at home.
me:  what do you need to talk to me about? 
mom: well, i made you an appointment at 8:30 on wednesday. 
me: an appointment for what? 
mom: an appointment for you to get a pap smear. 
me: what? a pap smear? why...no. do you know what? screw you. i didnt have sex with him. im not a fucking whore. goodbye.

i hung up on her. i called again:

me: oh, and one more thing. i'm not going. goodbye.

so things aren't going so well. i've gotten my heart broken and my mom thinks i'm a slut. she isn't concerned about whether or not i'm carrying diseases. i just went to the obgyn a couple weeks ago, so she knows i'm not. she wants to satisfy her curiosity. fuck that.

"event","today, i sucked at life. i fucked shit up in my classes and i slept. i can't seem to get things right around here.... unless i am asleep and then everything is perfect and wonderful. i am glad i have that escape. tonight was boring. i didnt have shit to do. i went to a dorm i dont live in and i ended up sprawled across the floor talking to people on the hall. they sat down and i sang sucky ass pop songs to anyone who would listen. it was quite entertaining.... mostly because i have strep throat and it all sounded horrible. but... i left soon after and went back to my room. i cleaned it and worked on my giant wall collage some more. i could use some magazines or something. it feels later than it actually is right now. thats pretty cool. did i talk about my halloween weekend at all?? i dont remember. or this past weekend??? i will sum them both up in one word: drunk. i wont be doing that again for a LONGGGG time. i decided that i didnt like it. i enjoy being tipsy, but not flat out drunk. it just sucks. i need to go shopping. i have too much black in my closet. it just depresses me. black band shirts and black hoodies. that is my wardrobe. eww. i mean, one or two band shirts would be cool, but i have like 12. that is wayyyyyy too many. i dont know how i got so many. hmmm. thats crazy. i guess they just appeared out of nowhere. i feel plain. it is time for new hair. the dye i used the other weekend sucks and my hair looks like shit. i had better call my hair dresser. aka adrienne loebe. she seems to know her shit. i miss her. i think she should come and see me this friday. i might be at home.....<br>

"event","hey.

i need to take a shower. i am also hungry. i slept through performance hour. theyve had stupid violins playing for the past 3 weeks every wednesday. i am starting to hate the violin. there are too damn many of them. theyre like.... ants. i have no clean clothes. i have no money. i don't know what to be for halloween. when adrienne comes over this weekend, she had better be ready to party. i want to dye my hair more than anything ever right now. i think i am going to leave the blonde in the front and dye the rest a really dark shade of brown. who knows. i sure could use a ride to wal mart. i would love to have $1.25 to wash my clothes with. money to use the dryer would be nice too. i miss my favorite jeans. i want to wear them but there is dirt on them because i sit on the ground alot. everything smells like cigarettes. ewwww. i hate it. 

TONIGHT IS HORN NITE!!!!!!

i hope lots of old people come. that would be fun. i love listening to old people play their horns. they are the best at it. they know their shit. they know how to play a french horn like nobodys business. one day, i'll get to be old and sound good.

a certain someone is just starting to piss me off. i seriously need to start taking the advice of my friends. i'd save myself alot of heartache, stress, and sleep. but mostly sleep.

my ears itch. 1/2"" now. i hate the healing process.

goodbye until whenever.


p.s. note to creator of the cat mood things: i am feeling blank. there should be a cat with no face on my mood thingy. work on that."

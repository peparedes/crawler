Anyway Katie is coming to watch some movies with me at work today. My friend Barry is going to make it a long day with nothing to do. I love storms."

Even if I only got three hours of sleep last night before work it was all worth it and would do it again. I wish there was more to say but all I do is work. So I guess that's it for now."

I have been call an asshole for how I feel and was told I wasn't willing to do anything for someone. I would have done anything for her and I mean anything. Shes not who I thought she was. Shes not the person I fell in love with. I now know it will never be the way I want it to be and at this point I don't want it to be anything. I gave so much and tried so hard for her. She doesn't believe me when I said I loved her. No one knows what happen and no one can have an opinion of her or this but me. I'm so hurt on what was said today. I loved the past few months and thought I did a lot to show how I feel. If I knew this was going to happen... I don't know what I think about it. So I'm still coming home and my sisters having a party for me on Friday the 13th and I will be going to my Less Than Jake show with Mike. I'm going to have a good time and not think once about what I wanted my trip home to be. Well back to work."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Ok so now im back to work and not feeling at all better. In fact I feel worst. I watched Risky Buniess the other night and the train part got me thinking and I saw another night of not sleeping. I try so hard not to look yet I cant help myself knowing its going to hurt. But comments, away messages, profiles. I dont know what to do. Part of me says to tell her to fuck off and end it for good. but part of me feel it might already be there and as always im the last to know. I thought about that this weekend. Im always the last to know. Ill sit there and think all is well and then as like all the times before im killing myself over what I did and thinking of what had happen. I have no one to talk to and no one to understand. I have noway to win or get what I want. As always im by myself to deal with this myself."

"event","<p>So last night I needed to get out so I went to the beach. I sat on the sea wall for a long long time till I was to cold to sit anymore. Then I got in my car and just went aroung the city with my sad songs on. When I got home I just sat in my car and did the same. I so hate the weekends now. I think way too much and it hurts.</p>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Im not in a good place at the moment. Im at the point where I cant sleep and when I do I have great dreams about her. All day my thoughts are on them and all the stuff I wanted to do that he now takes the place of. I had planes for coming home. A trip a show. But now she will be going with him to see Less Than Jake. I need not to tell you how mad I am at that. I was cheated on and had no say to save it at all. Her mind was made up. After three years of some of the most amazing time she can just drop me like that. I just cant do this. I want to be with her so so bad. I love her I really do. I didnt say it to her and now it to late. I fucked up. I just want this to work. I want to be able to do it right and do it for real with her. I just want to say I dont buy that if its meant to be shit. If I did I would still be trying to be a pilot. You need to work for what you want and not give up on it. In three months I think Ill be coming home and its going to be so hard. I just want to kiss her again and hold her tight and now ill never let go. I would do anything for this. Its unfair I can only sit her and do nothing. Just think about the girl I love and her new boyfriend. When I said I love you I got hurt and when I didnt I got hurt. I dont know what to do. Why do I always get left behind. I try so hard I do. I just want it to be like it used to be. I fell for her hard and now im paying for something I told her I was uncomfortable&nbsp; with. I want to be with her I need her in my life and not like this. Reading her away seeing someone else with her love and attention. Soon pictures and stories. I cant do this. Im lost hurt sick with pain. I want to go home and have a true romance with her. Everything makes me think of her and I now feel as if im not even thought about.

And my brother wanted me to take him to downtown Disney and I said I cant. Im such a tool and an idiot. Im going home and going to try to hae fun. Im sure I will have a great time. So far I have two great shows im going to. Im going in to Boston with to ice skate and I get to meet some of my moms family. I wanted to show someone Boston and how I was away from all the shit I was going through here. Maybe if that happen I wouldnt be where I am now. Im still not sleeping and I need to shave. This girlat my brothers drum band thing trys to talk to me all the time but I just say a few words and call someone. I feel bad. Ill see her tonight and say sorry to her. I havent been calling my family up in Boston that much and need to do that as well. When I get back from home its all going to be different. Ill be in school ill have a job, a car, money and be able to do what I want. maybe ill feel better by then too. I doubt it."

these white pills aren't kind
i've given a lot of thought on this 13-hour drive
i missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
and slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
i've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
the days have come and gone
our lives when but so fast
i faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
where i laid and told you but you sweared you loved me more

do you care if i don't know what to say
will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
will i shake this off pretend its all okay
that there someone out there who feels just like me
there is

those notes you wrote me
i've kept them all
i'll give a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
with every single letter in every single word there
will be a hidden message about a boy that's
loves a girl
do you care if i don't know what to say
will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
will i shake this off
pretend its all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me
there is

do you care if i don't know what to say?
will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
will i shake this off

"event","so I posted a song on my myspace blog that I wrote over four years ago to/about my ex-fiance and almost instantly she posted a comment on it.  How did she know was she just randomly checking out my space?  Does she subscribe to my blogs?  What happened how did she it less than a minute later?  Were not friends. We dont talk.  Her and her family hates me.  Shes married and has a child.  So why in the hell would you write me?  You cheated on me!  Now your married to that fool and have a little baby boy with him.  So why say that shit to me?  Its not my fault that you were an idiot and now are completely unhappy/miserable with your marriage.  I would have tried to give you the world but instead you absolutely crushed mine.  So hopefuly I wont ever hear from you again EVER!!!!!  How dare you write me and want to talk about your marriage when Im sitting here almost five years later as alone and depressed as the day that you left me....."

"event","I gotta call a telephone call today.  
Somebodys offering a job a thousand miles away
and I wanna take it 
Its the opportunity of a lifetime
but I need a second opinion 
an opinion other than mine

(chorus)
So I 
Im turning to you
because you always seem to know what to do 
when times like theses arrive
I call on my only true friend in the world 
my girl 
so I, 
I want to know 
should I really really go and if so 
are you coming with me?  

Ive never wanted anything as much 
as I want you with me
you were the one who said to follow my dreams
of having a house, a car, a view of the stars and a beautiful wife
so I need someone I can grow with 
I need some love in my life

(chours)

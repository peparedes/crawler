"event","Today I am sick! I hate being sick. It is really boring.
Anyway, i've talked to alot of my friends in Denmark which is wonderful(I LOVE THEM)
and i really miss them.

today i'm also moving back to my old host-family which is ok, I kinda like the place where im currently living.

but, the most crazy thing this weekend was the weird Bush party up Carmi.
police everywhere, it's crazy that they really have nothing better to do. Anyway they stopped us even though we threw our alcohol away before they stopped us but they found it, we got a ticket because we were to many people in the car, it was really screwed up.

I went to Kelowna yesterday and bought some hippie - gear for Halloween. that was pretty exciting.
And i also talked to my parents...that was so nice...i miss them so much:)

im gonna lay down now im not feeling so well

"event","well, today i had a pretty bad day.
I slept zero the last night and I think i'm catching a cold. I also feel very very homesick at the moment. I miss everyone in Denmark. My boyfriend,my friends, my family. EVERYONE.
It's really hard making friends here, much harder than I though im afraid.
But I am trying, really hard. Its gonna be okay. This weekend there is a party i hope.
And then ofcourse there is Alice in Wonderland - me starring as the white queen. Exciting!:D
Oh, rite I went on a date with this cody guy, I've never felt so akward in my life. And he haven't talked to me since...asshole!! Guys gets me all confused. 
Anyway, that was my first canadian date, interesting...Like all the other things here.
Oh well...Im tired now, I'll post tomorrow again. Oh one last thing...I almost cried in front of my guidance counsellor in school today (Mr. Toneatto) because we were talking about denmark. tsk tsk i must learn to control those damn feelings:)
I LOVE YOU CANADA(L)

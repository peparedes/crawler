"event","Chloe stayed behind one of the many nooks and crannies on the TARDIS, listening to the familiar 'vworp vworp' noise the time machine made. She had escaped with her life; she was bruised and scratched up, her hair had been torn out of their braids and fell in fiery waves down her back, and her butt was going to kill her in the morning. But she was alive.

But she wasn't done yet.

Ten. Doc. 

He wasn't okay. So Chloe wasn't okay either.

So while the good Doctor sent everyone back to their worlds, Chloe stayed behind, hoping to stay hidden till everyone was gone."

"event","Chloe nearly bolted out of her chair, barely making it downstairs before tripping. She wondered what Ten had in mind, not that she figured it was anything bad. She just wasn't sure what it was. Not seeing anything in the front yard, she headed to the backyard instead, wondering what she should be looking for."

"event","Chloe sighed as she shut her math book, Metal Santa's ""Jesus Ate My Beef"" blaring on the radio. ""I can't do math like this,"" she moaned, ""I need the hum of my computer to concentrate and stuff."" She pouted, looking at the barren, burnt area on her desk where her computer had been till it blew up. It would be replaced in a couple of days, but till then, Chloe found herself bored. And missing people. ""I wonder what all the nice community people are doing,"" she wondered, taking her teddy bear into her arms and holding it close."

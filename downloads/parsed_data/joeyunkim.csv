"event","Sorry for not ermmm ever really posting.  I know I said I'd update this often but its really hard to find the time.  

I decided that I'd stay for another 3 months.  I'm having such a fun time, its hard for me to leave.  Can't really afford it
but decided to put a lot of the expenses on my credit card and pay it off using my financial aid when I start school.  Should have a lot of excess financial aid since I'll be living at home.  

Believe it or not I've been doing things here that are errmmm NOT typical of me.  

First atypical thing, I've been consuming alcohol... and lots of it.  Being tipsy is kinda fun.  They have this drink here called soju, its pretty strong, made out of rice and kinda like sake (I never tasted sake so I wouldnt know, but its the same clear color and made out of rice too so I figure its similiar?).  Anyways, weekends are usually devoted to drinking.  Wee.

Second atypical thing, I've been going to clubs.  Which is really fun, not that I have any clubbing clothes, but its still
fun.  Lots of pretty girls =)

Over the weekend, we were going to go to a district of Seoul called Hongjik (I think I spelled it wrong), it has a bunch of clubs and places that young college people like to go to... like Sool-jibs (bars).  But decided to stay in sinchon.  Anyways, initially it was going to be a Japanese friend, two japanese girls and another Korean-American friend.  But the group eventually ballooned to 3 chinese guys, a chinese girl, 2 japanese girls, 2 korean girls, me, my japanese and korean american friend.  We first went to a bar and started drinking.  Anyways, I exchanged numbers with everyone and we then went to a local club at Sinchon.  

Anyways, crazy things have been happening lately.  First, the chinese girl that went with us over the weekend, she's been text messaging me constantly.  Apparently she had a fun time and wants to meet up again.  So I text messaged her back and said we're going to hongjik this friday and that she's free to come with us(its a club night which means we can visit more than one club without paying separate cover fees).  She said that sounds fun but she'd rather do something with me tomorrow?!  Errm... I am so baffled because no girl has ever expressed interested in going out with me ever.  Not only that but this girl is very good looking, wants to be a hip-hop dancer?, and is the type of girl that goes clubbing a lot... mostly the type of girl that I'm usually invisible too and the total opposite of me.  I think this girl might have vision problems because there were a lot more single guys in the group better looking than me (it was actually pretty dark in the bar hehe).  Also, I hardly talked to the girl so she knows hardly anything about me.  Kinda makes me wonder if this is some nasty trick =)  Well we'll see, I messaged her that I was busy tomorrow but can go out on Thursday, which she messaged back and said ""Great"".  Not sure how we're going to communicate/talk because she speaks a little korean + very little english and I speak absolute no chinese and my korean sucks hehe.

Oh well, I'll update with pictures soon.  Later!"

"event","Sorry for not updating my travel blog.  I'll post some pretty long blog entries to cover the past two weeks over the next few days.  I'm actually leaving for my aunt's house in Daejeon and will be staying there for 4 days (I get a small vacation because Korea celeberates the Lunar Calendar New Years, which is this weekend).  I should have lots of time because my cousin will be out of town so I'll just be with my aunt and uncle.

I've had a pretty amazing time so far in Korea.  Class is pretty intensive, and to be honest I haven't given it my full attention.  (Bad Student! Bad Student!)  So I guess in this post I'll explain a little bit about the area I'm in.

I'm actually staying in a district of Seoul called Sinchon.  Because there are two major universities, Sinchon is a pretty trendy place.  I'm actually attending Ewha Womans University (Yes ""Womans""), which is supposedly one of the best and well-known schools in Korea.  Yonsei, which is right next door, is considered the second best university (next to Seoul National).  In any case, practically everyone here looks like a celebrity (i.e. astonishingly good-looking and well-dressed, that goes for both guys and girls).  Especially the girls, some of the most prettiest girls I've ever seen walk around Sinchon (and you can't walk more than 5 feet without bumping into someone and thinking ""wow"").  Supposedly though, I came at a bad time because its actually vacation time at Ewha, so its fairly ""empty"".  But it still feels very busy and lively.

I'm staying at the International Dorms (yes its Co-Ed).  Its actually pretty nice though, there's housekeeping everyday (they clean your bathroom + sweep your floors).  You get your own personal bathroom complete with shower.  They provide linens + blanket + TV + refrigerator + desk.  

My class is primarily made up of Japanese students.  My school enrolls A LOT of japanese students (I'd say like 80% are japanese).  Ironically, I think I know more Japanese people than I do Korean.  Thankfully, all the Japanese people I've met have been really friendly.  If I actually master Korean one day, I actually might consider learning Japanese in Japan.

Food:  Food here is amazingly cheap, but the prices make no sense some times.  For example, you can get a full blown meal (more food than you can possibly eat) for the equivalent of $3.00.  Yet if you go to a coffee house its like $4.50 for one cup of coffee.  Domestic beer here is really cheap, a pitcher (this is not a normal sized pitcher, about twice as big as whats in the U.S.) for about $6.00.  1 bottle of domestic beer is about $1.90.  As a result, umm... I've actually learned a couple of drinking games =)  They're actually quite fun heh.

Anyways, so far I'm having a very good time.  Part of me wishes I just went to school directly, but the other part is really happy I chose to experience Korea (even if its a short time).  Korea has left a huge impression on me, I actually wouldn't mind living here for awhile... if thats possible with my career.  If I make some good Korean friends here, I actually may consider coming here during every vacation I get.

I'll update the blog with my activities on my next posts, but so far I love Korea.  I definately am going to beg my cousin to do this trip (my older cousin was considering going with me to Korea).  I actually would recommend anyone, even if your not Korean, to consider trying it =)

Anyways, my laundry is almost done so going to sign off now.

Laters!

"event","My First Official Entry in Korea!

Just wanted to give everyone an update that I arrived in Korea safe and sound.  First impressions of Seoul is that its BUSY, and by Busy I mean Manhattan, NY busy.  Stores everywhere, I mean you can't walk more than 20 feet without hitting a place that sells something or some service.  So far I've eaten A LOT of great korean food and got to ride a bullet train several times.  I'll explain more later, but for now I'm kind of tired because I just got back from my cousin's house, he lives in Taejeon which is 2 hours away from Seoul.  Anyways, I'll give a more full account of my experiences so far with pictures later on.

"event","Labor Day sags with the prospect of a new school year.&nbsp; The brilliant weather mocks, and I can't bear the sight of the little boy I will abandon to preschool tomorrow so I can go entertain rogues. 

Somehow this day isn't as enervating as previous ""day before school"" moments.&nbsp; Perhaps it's just early.&nbsp; I'm on the porch at 8 am, the trim pretty is out walking and the beast is still asleep.&nbsp; Crickets and cicadas are trilling through the pre-car neighborhood. 

Perhaps, I'm just more prepared.&nbsp; The classroom is done.&nbsp; The odds and ends that I usually only remember the night before--extra toothbrush, homeroom prizes--I remembered three nights before, and there all packed in the trunk waiting to go.&nbsp; The only thing that remains is to make it through this day unhospitalized and wake up in the morning.&nbsp; 

Or, is ambivalence a sign of burnout?&nbsp; I should be glad I'm not frantic about tomorrow, but should I be concerned that I'm not excited.&nbsp; Maybe thirteen years is too many for me. Maybe thirteen years means I finally have experience to feel somewhat confident."

"event","Katrina was an indictment. The storm, the failed evacuation, the hamstrung rescue efforts, the ugly, toxic cleanup all revealed a disgusting state of affairs.  Our attention is riveted on the Gulf Coast now, where otherwise no media would bother to go. There's no news there usually, and we're attracted to the power stories in Washington and the glamour of New York and LA. Then, a storm (or a tidal wave) lands and momentarily we're attracted. 

So, why is it news now, and for how long?  Perhaps it's the random fury of nature that brings us to the TV screen, or the bungling of our always smug leaders.  Destruction makes good visuals, and sweating politicians offer great targets.  But don't say it's because as a nation we care about the survivors. Don't say it's the ""human drama"" because it is so clearly not. 

Consider the tsunami.  The survivors are still facing what could easily be termed a ""human drama"".  We don't care.  It's been six months and we've moved on to ""Dancing with the Stars"".  It's back to school time, and the World Series is on the horizon.  Did you know that Brad has been hanging out with Angelina?  Of course, you did.  And you stopped thinking about tragedy.  

In fact, the real human drama, the real tragedy, occured before the tsunami and before the storm.   The human toll of those natural disasters was exponentiated by the extreme poverty of the victims.  And people were dying before those events, just more slowly and with fewer television cameras. 

I think now about the places I've taught before and the quiet violence of poverty that my students suffered.  I wonder about those whose story will never be told to the media and whose needs will never be met by the Red Cross, FEMA, or care packages from school children around the world.  

Our poverty never gets attention.  It is especially telling when we elect people who budget billions of dollars for unreasonable enterprises.  Who believe that we can be a model for other nations.  Who design constitutions for Iraq.  Who believe that liberty will save the world.  Who offer debt relief to Africa in exchange for a commitment to human rights. 

What can be said about our human rights?

So go ahead, send your check to the Red Cross.  I did.  And, like you, 6 months from now, I will have forgotten the victims of hurricane Katrina, as I did the tsunami survivors, and the families of September 11.  We are nation of feel good charity and oblivion.

People live in poverty, and it takes a hurricane for us to pay attention.  Any chance one could hit DC?"

"event","I shrinkingly realize that this blog's title is a terrible pun.  Some of you may image Bill Shatner leaning over his electrified armrest and emoting some random notes about science fiction adventure.  Please be aware that I do not wish ""classroom logs"" to echo ""captain's log; stardate: 102.3"" in any way. 

The classroom logs are real. 

Late October, 2003, I was driving through the easy sprawl of Arlington, VA. It was trash day; all the neighborhood buckets were out from the evening before, dripping from a 3 a.m. rain. I remember the smell of hot, wet banana diaper tacos. 

There is really no way to excuse myself for becoming so grim on that drive.  Sure, I'd forgotten to take out the trash. So what if my pregnant wife would have to drag them to the curb.  She--the one who had quit smoking and grad school when we first saw the green and black pinky toe dance on the sonogram--was trundling and effervescent. I, instead, was a mope--amused, excited, and optimistic--but a mope. At the sonogram, I had mumbled, ""Weird,"" and the technician looked like she wanted to check my provenance. It did not get me to kick smoking: that would take another year and a half.  I was simply moping--getting lousy at a job I used to be up for, assembling baby furniture until I had to lie down for a few hours of sleep, wondering recklessly if other people ached as much during their pregnancies, seeing defeat, bankruptcy, abandon at every turn. There is absolutely no reason or excuse for me; I was being a lousy person, and being lousy at it.

I could get so depressed, and, then, I could swerve around a garbage truck on a late October morning, roll down a hill, and slow down near a pile of logs someone had left out for collection. I left the truck idling. Finding the three biggest, sturdiest pieces, I lifted them onto the tailgate.  When they stand as cylinders, they're only a foot and a half tall, but they weigh about eighty pounds each.  I hauled them to school, rolled them into my classroom, and had no idea what they were for. The kids invented many uses for them, but, for me, maybe because they were free, because they were so heavy, because they were so unexpected, because the students could ask ""Why do you have trees?"" and I could say, ""I don't see any trees"", maybe because--well, for me, it seemed like as good as any signal could be that I needed to start snapping the hell out of it."

"event","If assessment informs instruction, then a teacher uses each examination as a way to adjust the instructional activities of the following week to compensate for perceived deficiencies. There isn't a instructional or accountability element to it.  I punish my students enough and don't need a test to do it for me.

However, the SOL--at least at struggling schools--are used as a form of instruction and a form of accountability. I do appreciate that the tests are criterion referenced and untimed; they are leagues from anything administered in California, Illi nois, Iowa, or California.  But they do warp the free exercise of learning. We teach to the test, and students are stigmatized by failing them.   That's tragic and silly enough; add to that the fact that the English Reading Test sucks.  It's drivel.  Absolutely LCD crap.  And written by fools.  I'd be happy to blab all about the questions that are particularly egregious, but I like not getting fired.  

Tests of this level--these grand, high stakes, universally rendered, mythic, ass pimplin', archaic, Christian-right-chubby-rubbin' Scatologies Of Learning--can never work but will never go away.  Stupid people like numbers.  Assholes like to point and say, ""My white baby is so much smarter than your baby who, sadly, is not white.  Here, please take this basketball/soccer ball/nanny job/prison sentence.""

There have been nonviolent protests; will violence be the key, then?

Also, these week, I chose a Graduation Poem from 27 entries.  Mawkish and underdeveloped. But still, I hated to disappoint those who did not win.  Competitions for writing are not what writing is all about. I hate your abysmal and deeply-personal writing, and you hate mine, and that's perfect."

"event","I woke at 11 pm to shower and ate a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich--cornerstone of the 7-11 line of microwavable treats--on the way the Gunston lock-in. 

Lock-in is an ""up all night"" affair for 8th graders, where they can play basketball, pool, dodgeball, soccer, or video games; watch movies; eat ice cream; give manicures; perform karaoke; dance; and/or watch movies.  No one sleeps, and the students are literally locked-in until 7:00 am.  

I took the late shift because I am a night owl and because an 8th grader at 4 am is majestically surreal.  They wander about like zombies, giggling maniacally, with red bull and lust coursing through their veins.  Their usual distemper is dampened by sleep deprivation, and they seem somehow more vulnerable, less defensed, and more real. 

And to see them at play . . . .  There are no middle school politics at 4 am to stifle creativity, mirth, and whimsy.  You can't be the grim, sarcastic, adolescent while you're wearing Tweety Bird pajama pants.  Girls--even the over-sexualized ones--stroll around with teddy bears and fuzzy slippers. Guys stroll around with donuts. 

Strange groups mix.   I saw a soccer team with four of Salvadoran ESL boys and one giant African American special ed kid; I can imagine them ever even seeing one another during the light of day.  I played basketball against the Green Valley Boys AND the Northside Perfect Girls.  

This is always the moment in the year--beyond any field trip or classroom encounter or afterschool game--where I am reminded of how kid-like kids can be if they give themselves a chance and we don't screw it up."

"event","This week, we finished a review of non-fiction.  In middle school, a ""review"" occurs when a teacher asks, ""Remember? Yesterday?  We talked about this?  You did a group project?  The homework?"", and the students respond with narrow-eyed curiosity.  I've been weaning them from open-ended responses and activities because the tests are coming soon (May 24) and they've got to begin to believe in the ""one right answer"" dogma of NCLB.  Their quiz and test grades are abyssmal.  That should set them on a perfect downward confidence trajectory that will bottom out nicely on test day.  

In a few of the classes, we discussed the nature of imagination.  Most students posited that the mind in generative; these nifty ideas just pop in. As an experiment, I explained that we could generated a class story out loud and had two students choose names for the main characters.  One chose Bob and the other, Sally May.  I paused the story making there to ask the other students to guess where those names had come from.  They weren't new names: they must have heard them somewhere before.  Students talked about the possibility of relatives, TV characters, book characters, old jokes, old friends.  At that point students began to consider imagination as more of a regenerative phenomenon.  Old idea are recombined and recycled to bring out fanciful imaginative ones. 

The students giggled nervously when I asked them to consider this:  that if one of their peers one day became a writer, then perhaps that writer would include their name, or one of their habits or facial expressions or statements or something in a work of fiction."

"event","Second day on the Mr. Mom kick.  Working the second shift: after school I've to pick up, entertain, feed, bathe, and get the boy to sleep.  It's very tiring.  I've lost all orientation to the sun.  The thing is, I'm enjoying it, and I should be--more time with Senor Fat--but all the time I'm wondering how I'm going to keep it all together, where I am with dinner, laundry, dishes, etc, and always an eye on the clock and on Chub to make sure I'm not pushing his schedule too far.  He's chipper mainly, but when it's time to crash, he dissembles rapidly. 

Anyhow, this is my lot, and will be for quite some time.  C got her job and we're all proud and supportive--and reeling from the consequences.  

What, like every woman who works and has kids plays it this way--the second shift--and here I am playing the martyr.  I am, inescapably, a bit fat pussy."

"event","I have a sick day:  the kids are finishing a Myers' story about Brown v. Board, and I'm taking the day.  Really, I'm re-apportioning my work time because I have to go in around 2:30 to prepare for tonight's Celebrate Gunston.  CG is a conglomeration of all school activities pumping enthusiasm into one giant jamboree of adolescent so-very-important-ness. Choirs, ensembles, art clubs, international desserts, poetry coffee houses, and--my thing--shameless snake-oil auctioneering.  Yes, a fundraiser.  All sorts of people have donated all sorts of debris, which will then be bought by the charitable and recycled. Every TA homeroom filled a basket with themed items, bowed it all up, and these baskets will sell for $50 or more. Someone donated a vacation home for a week; someone donated an IPod. Big bucks for the school; Stepford-like chipperness from me. 

I have to put in about eight hours on this tonight, after untold many in preparation.  Truly the parents have been gracious and dauntless, but when the extracurricular becomes so central, it serves to remind me of all the teaching that I'd really rather be doing. 

Got a $3500 grant for my summer writing/painting workshop yesterday; will put in another for IPod podcasting today.  We'll see."

AT SCHOOL, poetry groans. Complaints come often about the boredom; the bored ones don't realize that their ennui is symptomatic of processing difficulties. Teenagers, as a class of people, have been degenerated: I can't imagine any of them able to ride a bus without a conversation, a phone, an mp3, a book, or a ball of lint to roll back and forth between thumb and finger. We have all lost the ability to entertain ourselves without outside input. Worse, we demand highly specialized and specific types of input: our friends, our music, our leisure occupations. Given anything outside of that comfort zone, we flail. It makes us entirely unadaptive and closed to new experiences, ideas, people, and paths of life. and teenagers are the worst. 

Think: as punishment, we teachers take away your stimuli, and you feel brutalized. That's sad.

So, I have the weekends off like a real person now. And my new boss told me yesterday that he was discussing with the owner how ""awesome"" I am. Things on the job front are pretty fantastic. And I still love dogs. 

I am obsessed with the new Andrew Bird album, Noble Beast. Do pick it up. Except the vinyl STILL isn't out yet. The cd came out in late january. WTF?

Anyway. That's about it for now. Gotta get to those doggies."

I had so much fun in Bloomington last week. I actually missed it. OK, mostly I missed the people associated with it, but still. You should all move to Chicago to make me happy. DO IT!

Anywho, the fourth at Sidney's was great. It was nice to have Kellyanna with me on the ride home. It was great to see Mike, MBL, Katherine, Chopra, Sid and Brenden. I'm thinking about coming back around late August, 25th-ish. Thoughts?

And I have acquired a guitar. It's pink and acoustic. I've named her Joni. I can play a D and a G chord! I am uber excited.

I think that's about it. I'm at work so I should go. MWAH!"

Also, I saw Iron and Wine on Monday at the Vic, made some new friends standing in line for the show. Hung around after the show and successfully introduced myself and shook hands with Sam Beam!!!!!!!!!

He is so super sweet. 

He did Laid in the Reins for the encore. And the awesome calypso versions of woman king and weary memory... PS _ I got a set list if anyone is interested. And the opening band, Caliphone, was pretty good as well. A little trancy for a show, but on cd or vinyl, top notch."

So if you want an update on my life here it is. I love my life. My apartment is awesome, my job is forcing me (against my will) to lose a ton of weight which is extremely positive considering how lazy I am (especially as far as exercise goes). I've been to some amazing shows and have discovered a couple new bands.

Ryan Adams was amazing. AH - Fucking - Mazing. I officially need every album ever by him. 

MC Chris - also amazing. He is a really fun show and extremely geeky and cute. I hope he facebook friends me back. 

Iron and Wine - WHY did it take me this long to get into him? Seriously, I am obsessed with ""Naked as We Came"" on ""Our Endless Numbered Days"".

     1969. I'm kind of obsessed with that year in general. It was the beginning of so much...Gay rights @ Stonewall, Women's movement, anti-war protests, Abbie Hoffman, Chicago riots...
  
2. You have a choice...to save the life of one dog, or to save the life
  of Bono. You have to make your decision quick! Who is it? The dog or
  Bono!?! GO!
     The dog. Bono can save himself or one of his many yes men can do it for him. Dogs can't speak english and cannot ask for help.
  
3. Solo work-wise, which Beatle is your favorite? And, explain why.
     I know the most John solo work. I don't actually own any solo beatle records and do not feel qualified to answer this question. So, clearly, someone needs to burn me some cds. Hint Hint.
 
 4. Is there anything you regret about your time at IU?
     Not having come out until I was 20.
 
 5. What is your favorite color? AND what is your favorite thing/object

It's been an interesting weekend/Halloween. And don't worry, I have pictures to  prove it. Facebook has them all but if you're not my friend on facebook I might have to email you them, you know, if you REALLY want to see me in my HP glory. Anyway.

Friday and Saturday were tons of fun minus the trip to Sports where dressing in drag as a young boy kept me from getting squeezed/molested too much. Katharine and I lasted roughly ten minutes before we high tailed it out of there. Yesterday I went to class dressed up and was nearly the only one, but that's ok. Everyone recognized me, which was nice for a change. Usually I'm obscure film/TV characters so the acknowledgement of my efforts was rewarding. 

Last night was a really good time. I actually managed to get properly drunk for the first time as Harry. Tension wasn't too bad betwixt me and some ... not exactly friends, which was nice. Pumpkin soup at Tuto Bene is delicious as well as wine tasting.

I saw Girlyman last night with Eric and Kellyanna in Louisville. It was an amazing show with fantastic audience participation and a nice two hour set, which is refreshing after seeing them open for Dar for like 30 minutes. So, the show. Wow. they did around 5 new songs which are really starting to show their abilities as growing songwriters and I was blown away. Ty also wrote a song about jealousy and they have a new road manager which makes me think maybe she is single again. After the show we were hanging out waiting for the band because I had my camera and wanted a picture. Ty and Doris came out and said yes very graciously to a picture. I introduced myself, and Ty said ""Yeah, we've met before haven't we?"" She fucking remembered me. So we got a picture with the two of them that will soon be on facebook if you want to see it or I can e-mail it to you. Best night ever.
Today was also life-changing. I started my volunteer work at the shelter and have, of course, fallen in love with so many dogs. I don't have the time or room or money for another dog and that is why I am volunteering. It is my mantra right now. Anyway, the dogs were fantastic as well as a couple of cats. There was a very cute girl there and I hope I run into her again because I am asking her out when I do. I also started a car pool already, offering a ride to a very nice girl who has the unfortunate circumstance of living in Briscoe. She was so adorable in an innocent kind of way. When we walked out to my car she noticed my many bumper stickers and said ""I love your bumper stickers. So you're a...vegetarian."" to which I answered ""Among other things."" Later on on the ride Melissa Etheridge came on, and I said ""If you weren't sure I'm a lesbian before, you are now,"" to which she laughed. When I told her where I live, she had no idea where it was. Even when I said it was near Soma. So she asked if we could go my house and then she would walk from there. She asked me which direction Kirkwood was from my house, and I told her I would walk her there with the dog. So, after a pit stop (because she needed to see the bathroom) at Soma I directed her toward campus. I showed her her local co-op and to that she said ""What's a co-op?"" Adorable. I felt like I was showing her my Bloomington as apposed to the north side of campus that she was used to. She also loved Bear and told me she's trying to be a vegetarian so I'm hoping I can offer her advice on that.  
And then I talked to Sidney for almost an hour and that was good. I miss her. I am so in love with my life right now."

"event","I love this town. I got up this morning, walked the dog then headed over to the Farmer's Market where I purchased a tomato and saw so many hippie babies in their snuglies. I also got an application so I can volunteer at the animal shelter. I then proceeded to walk around downtown and found a number of hilarious books for sale, but could not justify actually purchasing any of them. Then I went to Bloomingfoods for lunch, mainly so I could say my shiny new member number. And then I came home to my amazing dog. I LOVE today."

"event","So here are some pearls of wisdom from my history of rock 70's and 80's and Beatles teacher; ""The blues is the crust of the Rock and Roll pizza"". He also made some kind of small penis joke in class today. I love my life. I'm so glad I get to see this guy everyday. Well, Monday through Thursday, anyway. I also decided in class while watching a montage of Beatles images that if I ever get married and if there is some kind of reception, the first dance will be to ""In My Life"" and if you don't know that song for the love of GOD/DESS come over and I will share it with you."

"event","So last night my mom told she thinks marriage means a man and a woman and that gay people shouldn't have kids. When I asked her why she said because it would be a hard life, having two moms or two dads. I asked her if she ever met any kids from a gay couple. She hasn't. I asked her if she wanted me to set up a meeting. She said no, because if the kids are happy and well adjusted, her whole theory of hate goes out the window. I've decided it's her new church I want to burn it down. But I won't. I miss Bloomington. I miss vegetarian options. I miss liberalism and protests against the war and my friends. 
Aleksys also died last night. I don't know what I'm doing wrong with ratties, but now I'm really worried about Cassie. 
But I did introduce my little sister to Superman, and she LOVED it. She also told me I should marry a girl if I want and have all the babies. And she told me as soon as she moves out, she's going veggie. I told her when she tells her dad that she's a vegetarian she should also tell him she's gay, just for the hell of it. We laughed about his head would explode.
 I'm coming HOME saturday. And I mean Home. With a capital H. 
Now back to torturing my mom with LOGO."

"event","I'm taking half my vacation in Lafayette, IN. Which is way more fun than you'd think. My first day here, I just hung out with Sidney and Brenden and then Wednesday Sid and I went to Wolf Park and we got to see some beautiful creatures, but the best was the Coyote PUPPY! Her name was Twister and she came right up to the fence! Amazing. And then we hung out with Ashley and got ice cream. I miss them SO much. I was suppossed to leave tonight, but then was convinced by the HOTTIE tour guide at Wolf Park that I need to stay for Howl Night. So tonight I get to howl at wolves and then see them howl back at me! I'm so excited. I hope Rose(hottie) is there. She also has an accent. Anyway, that's been my week in a nut shell. I miss you guys and I promise I will back in Bloomington the Saturday or Sunday before classes start.
Here's a pic of Twister, hopefully.

Also, I have re-discovered Elliott Smith, and am obsessed with Either/Or. 2.45 AM might be my favorite, followed closely by Say Yes. 
And in dog related stories; Bear spit toothpaste at me last night. It was funny until I forgot this morning and wore the jeans to class with white spots all over them. No, it's still funny. 
I have to write two papers this week. I should start them soon. But then, I am done until fall semester. 
Kellyanna and I found website for an ALL vegan grocery in Portland Oregon. We're moving there. It's something like food fight or fight food. Check it out.

"event","i just accidentally listened to some old Tim McGraw song on itunes and i had these vivid memories of 10th grade. It made me a little sad...especially considering I've been talking to Berkley a lot lately. 10th grade was a really fun year. i wish i had more pictures. And a better memory."

"event","i guess i have no reason to stay in los angeles anymore. the industry that i had planned to speed my life working in now bores me. and the life i had in la is no longer my life. someone will fill my shoes...but will she'll fill them completely, which i was incapable of doing. everyone's lives will go on. probably in a much better way than they are now. 

at least she finally admitted what i've known for a long time...that i make her miserable and that she's better without me. that makes me feel a little better, like i'm doing the right thing. but then it also makes me feel worse than anything else has ever felt in my life. It's not like I didn't know that's what I made a person feel like because I HAVE known for months (if not longer). How could I not have known? It wasn't like the feelings were really hidden. But they were always denied until tonight. So in some ways it's a relief knowing, but, like I said, it also hurts more than I thought anything could possibly hurt. 

but it's an excuse to leave la, i guess. maybe i could even come back to ny. i forgot how much i missed it. but most of the time i feel like my life in ny ended. i don't need to move back. it's my past. there are other places other than la. not only because i hate los angeles, but because the thought of ever seeing her with someone else makes my skin crawl. it makes me want to scream. i never want to have to experience that. everywhere i go will have some sort of ghost that reminds me of the person with whom i thought i'd spend my entire life. 

i have to fly 'home' tomorrow. everyone keeps trying to get me to extend my ticket and stay longer. as much as i'd like to, i really just need to go home so i can cry in my own bed."

What Makes You Unique?

Katie, your most unique quality is that you're unusually Intense

You're wound up and have a lot going on. Others may have trouble understanding what you're going through, but they generally find your intensity very compelling and are drawn to you. This happens even without effort on your part. Compared to others who are also intense, you are unusually quick to react when someone tries to hurt you. Only 2.1% of all test takers have this unique combination of personality strengths."

And how much I hated the grocery store that was the closest to us because it was closed on Sundays and also because it was mexican and it didn't fit in on the upper west side. And how it had tons of closets but they were ridiculously small and oddly shaped. And how you could watch the Thanksgiving Day Parade from if you stuck your head out of the window or got on the fire escape. And how we named all of our across the street neighbors. I wonder where ""Kathy"" and ""Steven"" are now. And how Monica and Holly came over one night after work to watch FRIENDS and they couldn't believe my stockpile of black beans. And how Eddie, the Super, would turn on the heat really high and I'd open my windows when it was snowing out and it felt perfect. I had on a mas during said facial when I was thinking this and I cried. Because I'll never have that apartment again. That was the apartment that felt like home. I lived in 2 others ones in the city for 2 different summers, but neither ever felt like home. That was the apartment that made New York City feel like the only place in the world. I missed Lennys, and the city grill, and Harrys, and that italian restaurant on 66th and Columbus, across from ABC and the movie theater, and Rays, and the sunday flea market across the street from my building, and that one summer I rode my bike in central park, and trying to buy the handcuffs from dress up in Webers but being told they were for people who tried to steal and not for sale. I think I missed that time in my life moreso that that actual apartment. I guess I realized I can never have that again, even if I wanted it. Sometimes I just miss my past. I miss these random moments in my past. Like rushing from work one day to go to the shoe sale at Bergdorf with Monica and Holly. And drinking at Dukes with them, during a snowstorm. And meeting a stranger named jc and carroll getting in a fight in some bar called Martinis that no longer exists when it was blizzarding and work and schools were closed. And buying a subway map in a store in the world trade center and then a month later watching it collapse. And then being dragged down to the rubble by my parents when all I wanted to do was scream at all the tourist assholes for making it a tourist attraction. it was a mass grave. not somewhere to file by, taking pictures. To this day I hate that I did it. I also hate that I didn't volunteer to help look for people and things immediately following. I hate myself for that. My school sent some people to help and I could have gone and I didn't. 
Anyway, something really triggered these memories of this other life I had. It's not to say I don't like my life now. Well, I hate where I live and I don't feel settled like I have at every other point in my life but I do like my life with the ladyfriend. And I wouldn't trade that. I guess I'm just really happy that I had that New York experience. It was perfect. I doubt if I ever moved back there it would be the same. My life isn't the same. I'm not in the same place. It was perfect when it happened and the way it happened. 

I forgot how good cold weather feels. It's somewhat cold (40s) in Seattle right now. I love walking out into that."

"event","i really wish i didn't live at the end of the world. i can't really take trains from here because it would take 24 days to get anywhere. Plus Amtrak sucks, thanks to car and oil companies and the good ol' united states of america. Thanks, United States government, for not investing in highspeed train travel like the TGV in France or the InterCity Express in Germany. or the whole effing Eurail in all of Europe. Delta and US Air, among others, have been on the brink of bankruptcy for YEARS and the government keeps bailing them out. Stop bailing them out. Then the other airlines will stop sucking and get their acts together. But that's another subject completely. Government, stop kissing the ass of car companies and gas companies and build new tracks so this FictionalHighspeedRailroad of mine will have it's own tracks, and not have to use those of freight company's (who get priority, thus stalling Amtrak trains ALL.THE.TIME) tracks.&nbsp; Some of us hate planes. And driving isn't cool. All I want is a train. That moves fast. Like they do in other ""real"" countries. 

This is just another mess I'm going to have to clean up in the my future political office days."

"event","these are the things i dislike the most (currently):

-Islamic douchebags (so every islamic individual)
-mexicans 
-mayor mexicano
-any politician who is more concerned with political correctness rather than doing what needs to be done (so that means every politician)
-welfare
-strippers with hearts of gold
-the fact that i'm a racist if i want to have white history month, but black people can have black history month and no one cares. celebrate rosa parks all you want, i still say she was a moron. the back of the bus is the best part of the bus, idiot. way to lose the good section of buses. 
-kids with mooostaches
-people who want the 2016 olympics in los angeles. 
-weather people in la
-sylmar
-morgan spurlock(sp?)
-people who stick their legs in dry ice


i enjoy the following:
-koko
-americans who answer the phone at delta
-gay southern boys on reality shows
-dippin dots
-thunder
-melrose place

i'm bored."

thanks, Mr. Governor, for calling in the national guard to the airport. And fuck you, Mexican mayor, for not supporting that. Stupid fucking dirty mexican. I hope Arnold kicks you in the face with the help of his national guard friends. why we've allowed mexicans to hold political positions is beyond me."

"event","i'm going to have to start making plans with my old friends. Sitting here, alone, every weekend night isn't fun. <br /><br />i'm really ready to go home. i tried changing my ticket just now to leave earlier, but it cost like $500 extra. It's not that I want to leave THAT badly, but I'm just bored out of my mind every night. It's okay on weeknights, but sitting here alone in my living room starting at 9:30 or 10 on a friday and saturday isn't really my idea of fun. I'm <em>SO</em> glad I stayed up this morning when I was miserable and exhausted so we could do stuff. I should have just gone to sleep instead. <br /><br />What a great weekend. Yet again."

"event","For what you did to me,
and what I'll do to you,
you get, what everyone else gets,
you get a lifetime!

Lets Go! 

Do you remember that day when we met 
you told me this gets harder 
well it did!
been holding on forever,
promise me that when i'm gone you'll kill my enemies,
the damage you've inflicted temporary wounds
I'm coming back from the dead and i'll take you home with me
i'm taking back the life you stole

we never got that far,
this helps me to think all through the night
bright lights that, wont kill me now, or tell me how 
just you and I your starless eyes remain.

Hip Hip Hooray for me, you talk to me, but would you kill me in my sleep 
lay still like the dead
from the razor to the rosary
we could lose ourselves
and paint these walls in pitchfork red

I will avenge my ghost with every breath i take
i'm coming back from the dead and ill take you home with me
i'm taking back the life you stole

this hole that you put me in 
wasn't deep enough 
and i'm climbing out right now 
your running out of places to hide from me 
when you go
just know that i will remember you
if living was the hardest part
we'll then one day be together
and in the end we'll fall apart
just as the leaves changing colors
and then i will be with you 
i will be there one last time now

when you go
just know that i will remember you

i lost my fear of falling
i will be with you
i will be with you"

"event","Okay, for the past few nights, I've been having I guess a 'series' of dreams. All focusing on this murderer. I mean...it's werid, you know? He actually killed someone right in front of me in the first one. I don't think anyone else has been in the dreams, except Heather really. And last night Aleshia Steward was in it. O.o;; How weird is that? A girl I haven't seen in 3+ years...So, no one else I know has been murdered in the dreams, just random people. The guy actually scares me to death because for the most part, they've taken place inside and around BHS, and it has A LOT of places to hide in it. And the other night was fucking weird too. The last thing I dreamt was that there were bugs (I think it was bugs) either scratching on or coming out of my throat (again, I can't remember). That was the first dream I actually sat straight up when I woke up and started  clawing my throat because I thought they were there. Hopefully these things will end, last night I actually got close to him but he said that he was ""done with his old ways."" 

Okay, so I'm done freaking people out, yes? Whee, go me and my murderer dreams. x.x;;;"

That little lane next to the two car lanes on 14th street has a pretty icon in it.&nbsp; It's a person on top of two wheels.&nbsp; I&nbsp;suppose that technically, that could look like a motorcycle.

But it is, in fact, a bicycle lane.&nbsp; Made for bicycles.

I guess that I&nbsp;don't really care if you use it to get to the front of the line when there's a long wait at a red light.&nbsp; But when you then honk at me in the middle of the next block because I'm not going as fast as you'd like, that's annoying.

In other news, apparently the demise of our economy has caused a dramatic upshoot in people commuting in cars.&nbsp; Or, at least an increase in the number of people waiting at red lights - that's what I&nbsp;tend to notice.

In other other news, commuting via bike is nice, except for the people who make it not nice.&nbsp; Riding is now officially faster than the bus."

I know there's a &quot;disable&quot; option on them, but it doesn't seem to work - probably because I have third-party cookies disabled.<br /><br />The solution is easy - I now have Adblock Plus installed.  I'm not using any of the advertisement subscriptions - I'm blocking only a single entry, *.snap.com.

Consider SQL.  Any decent SQL interpreter terminates a command at a semicolon; thus, you would expect
<code>SELECT name FROM sysdatabases;</code>
to do what it looks like it would do.

But in <i>OSQL</i>, the interpreter for Microsoft's Data Environment, it's slightly different.  There is a slightly different syntax - 
<code>SELECT name FROM sysdatabases;</code>
just results in another prompt.

The proper way to run the command is:
<code>1&gt; SELECT name FROM sysdatabases
2&gt; go</code>

The semicolon, of course, is unnecessary when you've got <i>go</i>.  Which, of course, has to be on its own line.  At least they make a small concession to *everyone else* - it doesn't throw an error if I leave the semicolon there.  Which makes everything better.

"event","OK, so I officially hate Verizon.

Section I: I have a cell phone, so I figured that to save money, I would get their cheapest per-month long distance plan, and just use the cell phone.  ""But it'll be expensive - 30 cents a minute!"", they said.  Great.  Whatever.
And then they send me a summary of my plan: I'm on the 40 cents a minute plan.  50 if I call during peak times.
I don't really care that it's so expensive, because I'm not doing long distance from my landline anyhow.  But the fact that they quoted me a price and then sent me info that was significantly more expensive is ridiculous.  What if I had made a ""30c"" call this past week, before the letter came?

Section II: They sent me a defective modem.  Well, it's not necessarily defective from their viewpoint.  But it seems to have a strange problem where it won't give an IP address to Linux machines.  Or maybe it's dhcpcd.  I haven't poked it enough to see.[1]
Whatever the reason, if I reboot the modem and plug it into my computer, it stops responding and goes into a power-cycle loop.  I have to power-cycle it to get it to come back.
If I plug it in with Windows running, it happily connects and gives me an IP.  If I then reboot back to Linux, the IP stays.  So I can get on the 'net, as long as I start in Windows.  I hate everything.  And especially Verizon.

<b>Edit:</b> It's the OS, it seems.  Apparently, even pump(8) can't trick this modem.  So:  If you're signing up with Verizon for DSL, and you're connecting a Linux machine directly to it (I will experiment with a wireless router when UPS gets here tonight), don't get the very basic simple cheapest one that they have.  It'll be a Westell Model 6100, and you won't be able to connect.  Suck.

[1] Doesn't OS X use some form of dhcpcd?  I can't honestly remember, but they claim that the modem works with OS X, so maybe it's Linux.  At some point I'll poke it with pump(8), which is some sort of Red Hat devilry, but has a ""pretend to be a Windows box"" argument.  It fooled the Cisco routers at Oberlin, so maybe it'll fool the modem too."

We signed up for DSL, because it's cheap, and they sent us the modem and stuff.

Problem 1: From the Verizon TOS:
<b>3.6.5</b> You may not use the Broadband Service to host any type of server personal or commercial in nature.

Problem 2: They enforce that particular bit.  Sort of.  It's security through obscurity - there is exactly zero documentation on how to access the modem's control panel web page thingy.  If I hadn't used a DSL modem before, I would have no idea how to get there - and therefore no idea of how to set up a tunnel or open ports.

So: It's against the rules for me to run my webserver, and I feel icky about how few people would be able to figure out how to do it.
The answer?  Today I switched to Speakeasy.

In other news, I have an interview on Monday.  Here's hoping it goes well.  And that I really like the job.  And that they want to give me lots of money.  Yeah."

The difference: *3* business days, or 5 calendar days.  They also promised that I could get it tomorrow if I chose next-day shipping.

In other news, they turned on one-click shopping for me.  Again.
For those who haven't heard my rant, the last time I shopped from amazon, I ended up buying something I was intending to buy anyhow, but a few days earlier than I planned, because one-click was suddenly on.  I admit that it was my fault, because I was just clicking where I knew the ""add-to-cart"" button was, and then went through my cart to see the total cost, and didn't read the text on the icons.

But what if I hadn't wanted to buy it?  I put stuff I'm not necessarily going to buy in my cart all the time.
I am sure that I didn't turn on one-click shopping, but someone suggested that perhaps I had done it accidentally, or by mistake.  I accepted that as a possibility, and went on my merry way.

But, as I went to buy something yesterday, what did I find?  One-click shopping was turned back on.  I've been *very* careful not to turn it on, because I don't want it.  I considered buying elsewhere, but Amazon was the only place I could find what I was looking for.

After the last time, I deleted all of my credit card information, so they can't actually charge any money with the one-click thing.  But I don't understand how it got turned back on.  And I'm frustrated.

In other news, I wanted to buy headphones.  There was one model that I decided on, and it came in lots of colors.  Two days ago, I put the green ones in my cart.  Yesterday, I tried to buy them, and it said that the green ones were no longer available from Amazon - only from their partners.  And if I bought them from the partners, they don't count in the $25 for free shipping.

So now I'm getting blue headphones.  Not a big deal, but more frustration on top of everything else.

I will preface this with the fact that an airplane that was supposed to take off at 7:15 actually did so at 10:45 due to bad weather in Boston.  So rather than get home at 9:30 and have a late dinner, I was faced with the conundrum of having to feed myself while maintaining my vegetarian state.
I began at a small coffee-shop-type-place that served bagels and wraps and stuff.  They had a ""vegetarian wrap"".  It had the potential to be at least a little bit interesting.  So I got it.
Turns out that vegetarian wrap means ""salad that you eat with your hands"".  There was lettuce and a little bit of red pepper, wrapped in a spinach-colored burrito shell.  At least it came with a little carrot stick...
I was less than satiated.

I then wandered around to see what else was open.  There was a Burger King, and I went by to see just how little there was that I could eat.  The server-person said that I looked amused; I told her why.  She immediately said, ""Ah, but we have the Vegetarian Whopper!""  Not posted on any of their listing boards.  But whatever.  There aren't that many vegetarians around, I suppose.  I had money, and time, and was interest was piqued, not to mention my appetite, so I decided to experiment and get one.  She asked me if I wanted lettuce, tomato and onion; I asked her to hold the onion.

I got my food.  I sat down and looked at it.  It was, in fact, vegetarian.  It had a bun.  Lettuce.  And tomato.  They were nice enough to throw in a slice of cheese.
And that was it.  The Veggie Whopper, as it's called, is their Whopper-burger, without the burger.  And it's $2.19, only 30 cents less than the one with the meat.

I eventually went to Sbarro's and got overcooked pasta with bad cheese.  Because that was the best that I could do.

Next time I go to the airport, I'm having dinner first."

"event","Well, here I am.

This is a beginning.  I'll use this to share my thoughts with the three people who know about this space.  And maybe it will let me get out some of my frustrations.
Writing helps, so they say.  Like talking to people.  But I don't have anyone to talk to.  So the mysterious aether of the internet will have to do.
If you don't understand something that I've written, tell me.  Most of what I'm writing makes sense in my head.  Hopefully I can straighten it out for you.

I'm tired.  And lonely.
Between saying goodbye to the people at Simmons, and then to Kate, and feeling like I did neither of them properly, I feel like I'm leaving everything behind.  I know that I have friends at Oberlin, and that my friends will be here when I come back, doesn't help.

I've been watching episodes of Voyager on my computer.  The ones where people die, or get sick, or develop a recursive loop in their holomatrices, but then get saved by some miracle of time-travel, or advanced (and entirely unbelievable) technological breakthroughs.  Or the crew coming together to care for one of their own.  I like that the best.

I know that my life isn't scripted.  There isn't anyone 15 years in the future trying to send me messages.  Things don't always work out right at the end of the episode. 

I feel some sort of point arriving here, but I can't quite spell it out.  Something about life lessons and deep stuff like that.  But I'm tired.  Perhaps I'll write more when I've slept, and am thinking clearly."

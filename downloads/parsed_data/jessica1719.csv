"event","Ok another week has gone by. School is getting quite boring..but its okay. This weekend was pretty good though.  Friday I came home and cleaned around the house a bit..then me and benz went to eat at chick-fila, i took her home then staretd getting ready to go hang out with john and his friend william for john's b-day.  Whitney comes over then around 8:30 we meet up with john, william, and jordan..johns brother.  They wanted to go see a movie but instead decide to go bowling. I for one suck at that game so me & whit just sat and watched them.  I also saw some other people i knew down there like Timmy, Jeptha, and Katrina so i talked with them for a bit while the guys bowled. We left there around 11:45 cuz the guys had to be home. I hope u had a good b-day john..i didnt have enough money to get you a decent birthday present but me & whit did give you a kiss so thats good enough right :)? That night whintey spent the night..we woke up around 9 cuz i had to take my car to ptc to get the oil changed. whit went home and i follwed my dad over there..dropped off my car..took him to work in my moms car then came home. I had to go back and pick him adn my car up around 1 so i did that. on the way back we went to the ptc pet store and i found this adorable chihuahua he was a t-cup and was 1 lb. ohh my goodness. but he was also $700. I really want a daschund though..i foudn oneof those too for $600. but he was going to be a big one and i want a mini one. Im hoping they will get me one cuz the love of my life dolly my dog is dieing i think, she is like 15 and the other day my dad found a tumor thing in her stomach :(. i am taking her to the vet tomorow. but anyyyways..after i did that i had to babysit for the easterwoods at 8..got off around 10:30 then went and picked up benz who was supposed to be at stasias b-day concert but her ride didnt get her. so i took her there and back home before i went to roni's sleep over. There it was me, kim, katie, brittany, nichole, and kayla. It was fun, i hadnt spent the night with more than one girl in i dont know how long..my choice though, ha. We stayed up all night til about 7:30..then went to bed and woke up around 10..then i came home and started feeling sick. i napped all throughout the day and then this morning felt even worse so i missed school then went to the doctor. i am now on 2 antibiotics. wooo hoo. anyways im going to go read this book i gotta start for lit..peace kids."

"event","This week was the first week of school..besides the meaningless friday. It hasnt been so bad actully...I havent had too much work till on friday when i had 2 test. One in Lit and one in U.S. hist..the one in lit was just a vocab..and the chapt 1-4 test in u.s was easy as nuuuuttts cuz i have holland and she is a pree school teacher (right kyle) and she lets u use your notes on ur test & all...so piece of cake. After school friday Jim drove me and janet to ptc cuz i wanted to go to the pet store to look for puppies. well i completely take us down this long assss road and miss our turn )sorry jim) and by the time my dumbass self realizes it..its too late cuz the pet store was closed seeing as how it was around 7:15. So we decide since we are there we'll go get starbucks or some shit but instead i wanetd marble slab. so we go there..get some ice cream and sit outside and talk for a bit..that was nice. then matt called us so we go meet up with him and paul. Traces of Day was supposed to be on the radio that night at 9:00 so we all sit in matts truck listening for it then the guy comes on saying how homegrown wouldnt be on tonight and he was sorry to the band traces of day. but its all good it was stil cool to hear their name and now he says he'll play the song twice since it got canceled the original night..so that got us all excited then the 5 of us decide to go to blockbuster. We wanted a scary movie but didnt find a good one..so then matt finds one he thinks will be good..cant rememebr the name of it though..so we take it up to check it out and the guy that works there is all ""no this isnt scary..its more funny"" and matts like yea we want that..and the guy is like no if u want that get this one called ""The Clowns from Outter Space""....wow. so we get that go to jims and watch it..wow what an experience. These gay little clowns kill people by shooting popcorn at them out of this water gun looking thing..then they shoot u with this other gun that wraps u up in cotton candy...YEA. kinda funny though seeing as how janet was scared of these clowns. Then whit comes by just in time to catch the end to this wonderful film...and uh yea thats about it. Saturday i clean then call jan and we go to her house order pizza and watch some films. she was going to spend the night with me but instead i spend the night there. so around 9:30 we go hang with matt, paul, and jim for a bit..then we go to qt so i can get an icee..then to bed. this morning we went to church then i came home..went to fayetville and blah blah blah. yea im done, peace"

Whitneys parents said i had to have her back in grantville by 10 which would of been gay since my curfew wasnt till 12, so we decide to bullshit our parents & tell them we are going to stay @ ambers for the night, when really our plan is for me, amy, amber, & whit to just drive around..and prob go hang with people all night & end up staying at ranen's apt maybe..well..this doenst work out..my mom says yes to ""ambers"" but my dad says so..so we take whintey home around 9:55..well on the way back i got on the wrong exit ramp (ambers fault, ha) and we go north. so we're like ah shit we'll just get off at the next exit..turns out the next exit was like 8 miles away. so finally when we start going south again we see a sign that says 7 miles back to grantville..and 17 miles back to newnan. so im like gd it. this sucks. but oh well we finally get back into newnan..after a few wrong turns (eh girls, ha?) then we go hang out with chris & ranen at the apt for like an hour then i go home. sunday i do nothing but hang wiht my mom. well tired, bed later"

"event","Ok..let's see, saturday me and benz had planned to go to the copeland show. so i get home around 12:30 friday night from hanging with millie, chirs, and some other guys. then i hit the sack and woke up around 10. I call benz and she tells me trey is going to the show with us and we are all going to atl a little early. so i get ready then head over to benz's house.then trey came and picked us up. we drive to atl and trey takes us to this kickass restaurant called..jade palace i think? anyways it was really good you picked out what you wanted to eat and they cooked it in front of you. he did a wonderful job on that place. so then we had a while before the copeland show starts, so we head over to the park. We get there and see all these kids swiming in the ponds & stuff so me and benz get in with our skirts on..but eh we didnt care it was fantastic, untill these little kids got in there and started splashing around, so then we got out. The 3 of us took some really cool pictures then we walked around and looked at all the different bricks. Oh yea, some older guy kept following us around which was kinda creepy, but oh well. its all good. So we talked for a while about what we thought would be good dates, and good proposels and stuff..it was so much fun just talking and doing something different. I LOVE THOSE TWO!so after a bit we left, to go to the copeland show. Matt walker called me and we convinced him to come to the show with zach, so that was cool. we get there and stand in line for a bit..then buy our tickets & head in. Benz got up in the front and i was a little more toward the middle of the crowd with matt, trey, stevo, & zach. shit was funny as hell listening to them sing in their girliest voices & make smartass comments to all the bands who played before copeland, i about pissed my pants. then for copeland mercedes got the bitchy girls in the front to let me come up there with her cuz she wanted to sing to me. well..there was one band who was the last to play before copeland who sucked sooo bad and made us both want to pass out and sleep. they were just so ______________ cant even think of a word to describe it. boring i guess. but then it picked up when they played the main song i knew (also on mine and mercedes love mix) ""ill take care of you"". it was really good, and benz sang to me. then they played maybe one other song i knew but it was ok cuz i had a good time. after the show we stopped by eriks for abit then i spent the night with benz. this morning we got up, went to waffle house, then i went home, took a shower, and went and hung with erik & trey. so all together the weekend was really fun and i had a GREAT time! <3 you kids! jess"

kickass car/golf-cart thing..well..it was cool but only went like 25 mph. so some of the cars on the road were getting pissed off..others were honking and laughing at us. we pull up beside this van and its all these guys..2 of them jump out and ask if they can ride with us..so we're like uh yea sure. so we ride around then we drop them off @ wendys and me and mill go to mcdonald's. there we see David Clifton, Jim Harrison, Jake Reichel, and clayton. so they say they'll call us later on that night. so we end up going over there that night with cameron hyde and ryan. so that was cool, they are all funny motherfuckers. then thursday millie's brothers friend says we can take his big NICe truck. so we go find stuff to do. we are riding around the strip and see zack a, alex, richrd, and mitchel bowen (nicest kid ever). then that night katie and roni called me asking if i was down there and saying they wanted to go bunjee jump. so me, mill, roni, and katie go over to the strip and find what we think is a bunjee. well, it turns out the guys there tell us that what u do is they lift you up 150 ft in the air and you have on this vest thing strapped to a cord, strapped to the cage lifting you up. then once u get to the top the guy controling it opens the bottom part and u are like in a sitting position with ur cord hanging off the thing..and then they unclip you and u fall down into this big net which is raised a little off the ground. so basicilly you freefall 150 ft and if u dont hit the net ur dead..ha..uhh. being the bitches we are and wanting to do something fun we decide to. the guys were really cool and thought we were too, so gave us a discount and it only ended up being like 10 dollats a person. so we do that then me and mill go back to davids and then around 2 that morning go back to our hotel. then we go to seth tarpley's with millies brother and some of his friends who drove down that night & hang with seth, tim g, joey ward, and adam, come home around 4. next morning wake up, waffle house, and then we meet up with zack & them. chris and jay come that night too. we all decide we want to get drunk, so we finally get this one guy @a gas station to buy us a case of bud light. well then me, zack, chris, and jay all go to see if someone wil buy us liquor. so we get these guys who say they will and they never come so we sat there for like an hour and wasted time. then we went back and millie is hyper/drunk. funny shit though. i end up having 1 beer and decided to stay sober to watch millie..then she leaves to go somewhere with mitchel..dont remember where though. so me, zack, chris & jay decide to go upstaris and do shit to alex because he intoxicated and passed out. so we begin to squirt shaving cream on him and he stil doesnt wake up. then we take tampons..stick them in this nasty smelling salad dressing and put them on his face. then chris gets a pickel and shoves it in his mouth. then i decide to get mayonise cuz it smells awful. so zack hands me this big paintbrush and says dip it in the mayonise and paint his face (keep in mind we are filming this with zacks video-camera) so i start putting the shit in his hair and then decide itd be easier to sling the mayonise off the brush onto his face so he wont feel it as much. so i dip that shit in there and go to sling it off and the freaking paintbrush brekas off the stick and lands on his mouth. funniest damn thing i have ever seen in my LIFE. so yea that was wonderful and alex laughed like hell when he saw that tape. jiz was fed up. ha. so then chris & jay were supposed to go back to newnan but never did so they had no place to stay so millies mom says they can stay with us..well that nigtht after we leave zacks we decide we dont want to go home & millies mom is partying so she doesnt care. so we decide to stay up all night,drive around,go to wal-mart @ like 6 am and play hiding go seek..cool shit. then @ 7 go to publix to get some money chris's mom wired him. so yea we go back to the hotel at like 8 and are all pretty tired..but stil say no sleep. chris & jay took showers before me and millie were suposed to..but then we ended up faling asleep so they leave and tell us to call them when we wake up. so we do. then me, mill, chris, jay, laura, richard, alex,zack, and mitchel go to the beach for the day. then katie and roni come meet up with us..we all go our seperate ways..take showers meet back up & go out to eat. then we do that freefall thing again. so that night i FORREAL needed to get shitty since it was our last. so once again, me, zack and jay drive to the liquor store and find some guys who said they'll do it. we all put in money and end up getting the biggest bottle of vodka they had. then zack tells us to let him out @ publix and he comes out with magrita juice and pinacolda mixed stuff. so we're like uh ok. get back & take millie to hooters and she says shes coming back..but its her bros b-day and she just wated to spend a little time with him. so we go back to the condo and i begin to tear that shit up. i never drink liquor and am use to having alot of beers and being good. so i get out this big glass and fill it half full with vodka and just a ltitle bit of magrita mix. the guys tell me im going to be on my ass..but me and my stuborn self tell drink it. then i had lauras margrita she didnt want. then i poured me a glass of straight vodka and me and chris chug our stuff then the guys begin to tell me how i am like a guy with clochol..hmm ok. then i had a penacolada (sp?..but ew) so yea im feeling pretty tipsy and me and chris and zack decide to go skinny-dipping in the pool but cant cuz the cover is on it. well..11 o'clock comes and millie calls me telling me i need to come where she is NOW. so im like ok wtf? so dd mithcel takes me. her mom says that millie shouldnt of left me and i have to stay there with them. and by then i am SOO  gone worse than ever. all i can do is sit i cant even walk and my words are all slurred. so millie takes me inside this club and leves me siting there @ the bar while she goes and does her thing (dances). so im sitting there chilling dont know where the hell i am and am in a really depressed/bored mood. then i see zack who had came to bring me my purse i left. he helps me go outside and stuff and i am fixing to go back in and i sling my hair over & get back up..(wobbling i guess) and the guy stops me and goes UH NO ur too intoxicated to go back in, so the guy takes my braclet off. ummm ok. i guess he thought i had been drinking underage @ the bar there. so zack & them sit with me and finally millie and her mom came out. then they go back in and once again i sit outside. then her mom says she guesses they'll leave. so we do. then we go to waffle house with zack & her mom and everyone and i am stil in terrible condition. all i want to do is go to bed but no one wants to go in. so finally around 2:30 we go back & mill is a little tipsy too from the bar so we deicde to sleep. doesnt work out..some sluts her brother was with took our beds..(UGH) so we go in her bros friend room where no one was and slept. gah, what a night. taylor ferrish comes in there and tells me im a trooper but its going to suck in the morning. but turns out i wake up fine..millie says i woke up stil drunk becuase we only got 2 hrs of sleep..check out was @ like 10 and we got up @ 8. so eh? who knows. @ least no hangover. so yea then today we drove home and i went and got benz and we went to waffle house. But to sum this long thing up spring break KICKED ASS!! i have never had so much fun and hung out with people i didnt think id like and i now love em. but yea..school tomorrow, so later kids."

He is cool as nuts, we hadnt seen him since like 8th grade. so he talks with us for a bit, then we go to tan. Go to wendy's..then i take benz home. well i am here for like 10 mins and drew says he is going to circut city..then like 10 secs later he comes back in the house & goes holy shit who hit ur car? and im thinking oh shit..big dent or something. so i go outside look @ my front right fender.. and all down the side of my car is white paint. so there i am flipping out cuz its not just a few marks..its like i got the front of my shit painted white.  so i begin to flip out and just think of what my dad wil say..even though i didnt do it..still. hed be like..""no spring break, or give me ur keys"" or some shit.  so i put my wendy's down & go get this shit my dad has that is scratch remover, thinking i can maybe remove the paint. well i am out there for 2 hours scrubbing @ that jiiz, and finally it comes off. but there are 2 black scratches that is down to the metal so i cant remove those, but i figure the dad wont notice them just as long as i got the bright white paint off. so then i wash my car, and am stil feeling shitty..but then i remember i have wendy's to cheer me up. yea fing right..i go upstairs..sick my hand in my bag and pull out my nuggets & frys covered in anys..MOTHER FUCKES. so by now i am extremely pissed off. Then my mom comes home..i tell her the car deal, but tell her to keep it on the low since i fixed it.  then she tells me they are having a sale @ goodys so i decide to go there to look for some skirts. i go get benz & we go.  i found the cutest fucking outfit..but had to put it on hold. then i dropped benz off & went to blimpie..and steak & shake for a chocolate milkshake (my fav) so yea..tonight turned out alright. now i am going to go do hw and get ready for bed, later.  jess."

"event","1st period started out pretty lame. We did a lot of work & then finished a movie..then i just talked to millie, matt, brian, and chris some. 2nd block was a bore as usual..considering i hate sweing. uh 3rd block we had this really cool sub named mr. prosper tong..he was from france & very cool. he kept having trouble with the computer so would scream phrsases such a ""shit damn it"" or ""mother fuck"" only it sounded way cool with his accent. he didnt make us do shit, someone was having a talk about sex & out of nowhere yelledd ""if your going to tap it you better rap it"" Mr. Tong just sat there for a minute..than yelled..thats right. so yea that was amusing. then 4th block i had another substitue who was cool & all we did was talk about music & take facts on a movie. So school wasnt too bad. Then on the drive home i realize how great it feels outside..so ditch the cancer box & decide to lay outside. well..i lay out fot about 10 mins.(i get way too hot) then trey came over & we watched texas chainsaw massacre, i think its a good movie. then i went to wendys got some good shit..and yea thats about it. Music time now, later kiddos."

"event","Uh, today was alright.  Kinda sucked last night cuz i couldnt get so sleep, and then we lost an hour..so being woke up this morning sucked even more than usual.  Let's see..i got up around 10, made breakfast, cleaned, took shower, then remembered i had to babysit 4:30.  so i go to babysit and this weekend they're are 15 kids there..which was very overwelming..and all of them are between the ages of 2-7. they did alright, except while sitting on the couch one of the little boys kept trying to tickle my chest..and then decided to stick his hand down my pants...jeez..his parents will deff have to watch him when he gets older. But yea, around 8 they tell me i can leave..so i begin to head out after the guy pays me 10 dollars..wow..what the nuts? that isnt even worth it.  so that large amount of cash will prob go toward filling up half of my gas tank..or wendy's or some shit.  so yea that was pretty much my day..now im tired so im going to go clean then prob just watch a movie for the rest of the night, lata. <3 jess."

Then when i get home benz calls me and ask if i want to go play tennis. i shower. and then go pick her up..so we get to the clubhouse & i am looking for a big enough parking place to park the truck in.  I find one i think i might can get into. well, turns out i cant park a truck for shit and im all slanted. so i try to reverse and straighten out..while doing this me and benz notice iam fixing to hit the van parked next to me..so i once again pull forward. doing this about 5 times i get frustrated and push the gas really hard, running over the chain link infront of the parking spots. so these 2 older men see me and with a grin on their face say ""honey are you alright? and im like..uhh no sir, so one of them offers to get in and get it out of there for me, i thank him for saving me the embaressment ha. benz found it to be one of the most hilarious things ever..so that made me laugh about it too. then we go in and eat, then deicde to go tan.  where i actually parked correctly..ha YES.  oh yea on the way to tanning some HOT guy honked @ us & waved. we just kinda sat there like who the fuck are you? but eh, oh well. he was hot.  so then my dad calls me and tells me to haul my ass back to ptc to pick him & my car up.  then we go eat chick-fila & i come home & take a nap. wasnt feeling to good.  Now im just sitting here trying to decide if i want to do something tonight, if i do it will deff be with benz. but anyways my cell is ringing & igotta go feed my psycho cat who keeps clawig my foot (i hate her)  later kids."

School was pretty boring as usual. nothing exciting took place except for this girl in my 3rd block gave me a cherry flavored condom, that was pretty neat.  other than that, it blew.  So after school i take me and benz tanning, then we decide what we want to do tonight.  i go home for a bit, then back over to her house where we get ready. We find out all the kids are playing poker @ jims so we deicde to go there. First though we want waffle house, so we go therer & its crowded as nuts..so we leave and go to taco bell where we see some bitchy girls giving us mean looks..fuck em.  Then we leave and head to jims.  We get there and see a bunch of kids. then sit around..and do nothing.  Then we go to starbucks, which is always cool.  Then back to Jims..and me and benz sit & talk.

"event","well to ""officially"" start spring break (since i havent done anything yet really..) linz  came with me to my drum lesson last night and slept over.  it was fun cuz she is reallt the first person who saw me play except for my ""instructer"" dave.  and she sed i was really good =)
well my grades have improved alot and i picked out a set, so ill probably be getting drums ina couple weeks :)...yeah finally some good news for chels

well anyway then we rented to movies from hollywood and we wanted to get ones we never heard of so we got ""camp"" and ""big girls dont cry""  we didnt have any instint popcorn so we had cornels and a popcorn machine..and it was basicully about ton explode....well ""camp"" was about this theater camp that had only girls and gay guys...and one summer a straight guy came and sexed up all the girls lol it was funny cuz he almost turned gay at the end.

  so then at around 11:30 we watched , and found out that ""big girls dont cry"" was in german so it had subtitles...yeah im the smart one who picked it out.  well anyway i knew it was gona be about ""bad girls"" but uh...i dint knwo how bad they were gona be.lol. it was rated R but we told Dan it was basicully a german porn movie lol.  the best part was when this girl almost got raped> cuz it was funny cuz it was a old guy. but also it was funny cuz the whole time i was trying to speak the subtitles and i was sounding french instead of germen.  and whenever the two girls woulh hug and kiss i woudl sart singing the lesbo german girl song ""they're not gona get us!"" by T.A.T.U  haha

well this is pretty long and i think we might do something today with  ""the 3 stooges"" and sarah. bowling? i dunno cuz are plans always get screwd up."

"event","well today i wasnt feeling so great but after talking to sarah i feel better. it not often that i have like that ""really happy this persons my friend"" moment cuz whenever i think that about a friend, i sometimes take it back. well i dont think i will....

LuvvYourHate: there was shit i had to deal with when i was younger and i alwasy thought ""i hate my life its never gona get better"" but the fact is...time goes on IT GETS BETTER and we get over stuff...and i think its better to have to deal with stuff when your young cuz i think its just Gods way of saying ""if you make it through this then youll have a great future"" like i think you are gona have a great life cuz YOU DESERVE way more than alot of people get, and thier the ones who are gona suffer when they get older...
soldout romancex: me?
LuvvYourHate: all this teenage ""OC"" type drama doesnt matter in the end....i honestly woudln matter having a depressing life as long as i knew it ended well...jeez i seriously think surviving teen years is the biggest challenge in our lives but eventually itll be a thing of the past
soldout romancex: i agreeeeeee!!!
LuvvYourHate: im just talking ""hypotheticully"" but yeah you are gona have the best life than anymore cuz you deserve it and eventually everyone gets whats coming to them....maybe people that get all the guys now because in their future they dont get married..and we do..or somehting...but i like the fact that once we get older we can meet everyone in the world and pick who we want to be ou friends instead of gettin stuck with people we may not like.....woah im feeling so ""wise"" tongiht lol
soldout romancex: haha yes! your telling me stff that a smart person knows:-)
soldout romancex: and your also gonna have a GREAT life .. outta eevryone i know .. you deserve it .. every fuckin second of it
LuvvYourHate: woah knows...maybe youll end up marrying who you like lol but the fact is  everything happens for a reason and alot of times bad stuff happens but then even better stuff happens...like my mom was engaged before my dad..but then broke it off..and if she never broke up with that guy she never would of met my dad (her soulmate lol) and wouldnt of been as happy> yeah thats just a example
soldout romancex: awww
LuvvYourHate:  and nah i already have a great life...cuz i have awesome friends like YOU..but you are gona have to best life ever and if you dont im gona force you to and if you dont like it well TOO BAD cuz ill do whatever it takes so that you can get what you want lol
soldout romancex: aww BG i fuckin love youu!:-) and spending so much time with you has already started my great life<3:-):-)
LuvvYourHate: hehe spending time with my BG has started my great life too ehhe<333333  man i sure do love helping the people i love..cuz you know we were all put on earth for a reason maybe mine was to be a philosopher and yours was to be the bestest person on earth hehe <3

LuvvYourHate: haha yeah i think you might win ""most talkative"" for the whole earth hehe but its a good thing cuz without talking all we woudl do is sitt around hateing each other cuz no one would be able to say anything hehe...and all i know is that you deffinatly were meant to be my friend cuz you always make me feel good and im glad i have you, so your purpose is to be the pimp-iest pimpshades, be a talker, grow up to be the best person ever  and to be my fwennnnnnd ehhe
soldout romancex: awww and bg .. your perpose on hte earth is to make me smile and feel happy times 1000000000! and make everyone happy by telling them good things about them and you were deff meant to be my frnd bc you always know how to make me happy and have a fun fun time! and we always can talk for 2 hours straight with a guy .. start out with a frown and end in a smile .. i mean only certin people can make me happy and your deffinitly one of those people .. i mean with out my bg .. my life would have this spot that needed to be filled .. but im just grateful that i have a frnd that cares about me and is always there for me like you:-)

"event","ok so this is probably the last time i'll be updateing for a while cuz i think im failing math and science and once my mom checks my grades online tomorow (like she gona do every friday) itll be all over for me. but not like it matters cuz no one noticed last time i was gone...but anyway i got some good advice from the guy whos been teaching me drums and he seems to ""know how it is"" so i took it. well heres today...

P1: WOW, thats all i got to say...so here we are watching ""the miracle of life"" in sex ed (with the hippie Ms. chiachio as a sub) an all of the sudden theres this huge crash..first i thought she knocked over a desk but then i noticed her running over to the phone. Blaine w. had a seizure.He banged his head into his desk then againest his chair then he fell out of the chiar onto the floor.  i felt so bad cuz ive been there passing out and not being sure what happened and it also got me kinda scared cuz ive been going to a brain doctor and theyve been trying to figure out some stuff about me and i wouldnt know what to think if that happened to me. 
P2:nothing al that great sewing class is kinda ""eh"" but o well it aint every day
P3: me and Dona talked about ""the old days"" of 4th grade and 5th grade...hmm i dont remember being so odd..;p
P4: i think thats when me and Erin were agruing with Dona for liek 10 minutes..i dunno but theres just something about argueing that i cant resist..and also miss brennan talked in her ""black man "" voice as she read us this story
P5: science test.""The Webb"" got mad at me. same old same old.
P6: at lunch Jack kept trying to ""feel me up"" again and everyone was arm wrestling and i beat Ant M twice and Jack was like ""ill arm wrestle you , and if you win ill leave you alone but if i win i get to grab your tits"" so of course just like yesterday joe ant alex and all them were like ""yeah do it chels""...uhh nah hes a wrestler (liek i woudl win)
P7:i failed my millionth quiz this week , yet i helped kids correct their quizzes
P8: we had our second day of ""Olympics"" in S.S my group was alyse rach mike ang and me. i was the only ""gold medalist"" on my team lol... and i think we got in last place..yeah PRETTY GAY HUH..hah i love that class cuz we alwasy do embaressing things>we even had to parade down the 6th grade wing with our ""olympic flags"". but i could care less

then tonight me and trac went to the high school for another ""funfilled night"" of ""42nd street"" then i went to old town music and now im here.yup. and i think im gona have another grounded-so-im-sitting-in-my-room-with-radio-on-in-the-dark>kinda weekend

and you people wonder why im alwasy looking forward to school?"

"event","if you havent read the previous entry read that first or this one wont make sense...

well last night as some of you know i was online at like 9 o'clock.. anyway i went away cuz my parents wanted to check my math H/W cuz i did alot of problems wrong. so i went in thier room and like always we started fighting. i dont know why i always got to fight and curse and yell and scream but then again i coudl ask my mom the same question. anyway stuff happened, and i was so over the edge that i had to do somethign drastic. i signed off from the interent ran into my moms bathroom and took back the antidepressents...big mistake.  i went into my bathroom locked the door and just stood there. i was holding the pill thinking about what i woudl do remebering what my mom sed about me not taking them. so of course being the intelligent person i am i just swallowed it. i had one of those moments when you smile with tears in your eyes. so then without saying anything i went to bed. i felt miserable but i was hoping the medicine would kick in and i woudl be happy the next day...then at like 3 oclock in the morning i woke up. i was sweating really hard my hands were shaking and i was breatheing really deep, i coudl feel in my stomach so much pain and the first thing that popped in my head was. ""why did i do it?"" i knew i coudlnt get back to sleep cuz i could hardly breathe so i just sat up and tried to walk to the bathroom to get some water. the second i got up i started feeling really dizzy and i coudl barely stand. i started to wlak out of my room and i think the sound of me runnign into the walls woke my dad up because i remember seeing him walk out of his room. then suddenly i collasped. i took one look up at the ceiling and blacked out. <lj-cut>

when i woke up i was on the floor in my parents room and they both were awake. my whole body was shaking and i coudl barely move my arms.  my dad kept asking if i was sleep walking or if something happened to me. i coudl hardly talk and my words were all slurred but i sed ""i took the antidepressents"" i tried to open my eyes and i looked up at my mom and i coudl see the disapointed look on her face.  my dad then went into my bathroom and found the pills and took them into the room. i dont really remember much that was sed but i do remember my dad asking me if i needed help getting back into my bed and i told him i couldnt lift my head up. so i decided to make laying on the floor work for me. for about an hour we all just talked about this and about our fight last night and i just repeatedly sed i was sorry and for once i really meant it :-/ i think probably every side effect that you could of gotten form the pills i had cuz i felt like i was just going to shut down. my dad threw me a blanket and i just fell asleep.  i woke up at around 6:30 still feeling weak and still not being able to get up. i honestly dont know how im gona start feeling any better. right now its about 11 and im sure everyones in school doing some frickin Do Now or something and 12 hours since i took the pill i still feel like shit. every once ina while il put my hand out and i can see it shaking, and i feel restless walking around and my head feels so heavy.  im not sure how to feel right now or what to think , cuz i think i just hit a all time low. but then again, once youve hit rock bottom, theres now where to go but up. right?"

"event","well im in one of those situations where i probably shoudlnt talk about this, but im someone who doesnt really care if people know stuff so here goes..well some of my friends know that i went to a brain doctor on friday in hopes of figureing why ive been getting major headaches for two years. well the doctor did some tests and he asked met aloot of personal questions and hehad a few guesses why ive been feeling so sick.(and mayeb if my whole stomach sickness is connected to my head) and so he suggested alot of things i should do, change what i eat, get a xray of my head, go see this certain stomach doctor, and one mor ethin that my mom wasnt to proud of. he gave me a prescription for anti-depressents cuz he thinks that im someone that has a ""chemical embalance"" and they woul help. so im all right with that. thats fine. but anyway tongiht im in the carwith my mom and she goes ""hey chel have you taken those pills yet"" me:"" no but im gona start tkaing them tongiht"" mom:"" well actually im gona take them away form you cuz i dont want you taking them, because i think you dont need them, your not a depressed person"" me:(pissed look) ""well thats your opinion"" mom:""yeah but its right too"" ...BULLSHIT i never stop hearing form my mom that im a miserable person and that she thinks im alwasy depressed and now when i actually get help she thinks theres nothing wrong because after all im am the daughter of a ""perfect"" person.  its bad enough having your parents complain that you dont smile enough but when they take it back by sayin ""they know you better then you know youself"" pisses me off. so what if im Mary fucking Poppins in school, i know tons of people that act happy when their not, and im no exception. i cant help being how i am and i wish i always wasnt o miserable but im realy starting to think that its not my fault, and that its just a ""chemical imbalance"". so FYI tomorow im gona be really pissed in school, or maybe i might be super happy..i dunno it all depends if i can find ""them"".."

"event","well yesterday sucked for trac/chels cuz they got their purses and cell phone stolen by these paulsboro bitches. i feel so bad and if i didnt leave early i would of probably gotten my stuff stolen too.

 this morning sucked cuz me and trac had to go to rehersel...4 hours of tap dancing ..and we still dont know the dance, and all we did was talk to alex the whole time :p  then me/trac/chels/linz went to the mall and on the way there lindsay told me that in desirae beebes subprofile she has a hitlist and im #1 , i actually find that more flattering than creepy...is that weird? 

at the mall we saw dan, dom,mike, den, and their whole gang and then me and linz went in Hot Topic and this 20 year od guy was hitting on her and gave her his phone # and his website. we were kinda creeped out but he gave me a hi five and asked for my name too. he kept staring at us the whole time and i was like ""he probably thinks your 18 and he wants to bang you""

well it seems like ever since the insident at RW last night my whole gang is ""prejudice"" and tracy sed they were having a ""blackfest"" at the mall tonight...and also chelsey woudlnt let me say ""cellphone"" cuz that got her depressed, so of course being the little assholes me and lindsay are we kept claling them and talking about cellphones and i was like ""guys check your cell phones to see what time it is "" and chels sed ""YOU DONT HAVE TO SAY CELL PHONES YOU CAN JUST ASK FOR THE TIME!""

..nothing else is really going on except for my new ""medication"" that everyone keeps asking about lol, no its not ""happy pills"" but pretty close..hmm its weird cuz most people would think i woudlnt need them , but also most people dont know me that well..

that was long.thanx for reading.heartheart"

"event","well it seems like i never tell about my day anymore in these entrys so i guess il talk a little about this week. we had off on monday and then we came to school late yesterday which was great. then later that night me and trac went to rehersel and it seems like we had a good time this time. except for the fact that the boys kept caling us ""14 year old 7th graders"" but then it was so  funny when we were doing a scene and ""alomst josh"" walked away from christina bland and she was like ""you better bring your milkshake back over to this yard!"" hah and then that tim kid is so weird and he was trying to impress me with his ""talents"" but it didnt really work out for him :p. 
then today first period we had our last day of gym and me and jessie were stanidng behind the net in handball and the gym teachers kept saying ""you chicken girls get out form behind the net"", and the whole class they kept calling us chicken girls. w/e but then my big moment came when i ran up and threw the ball and scored the winning point for me team (it was 6-6) and i jumped up and then ran back to the scoreing thing.  the other team thought they won and mr cross blew the whistle and everyone got silent and he was like ""chelsea warner scored that point before you guys did but she wasnt rude and cut infront of people, she went around so chelsea warners team wins"" and me and jessie were laughing and im like ""this is the single greatest moment of my life (that and also when i got colin out ;)
then 2nd period i made fudge again and screwed it up again, so i guess that was fun :p and hopefully my ""baby girl"" can hang out wiht me tomorow, so that should be fun:)

"event","well nothing really happened today, except for one important discovery. well for over 4 months ive had a bad stomach sickness that i havent been able to get rid of.  ive gone to the nurse more than i ever intended to and ive taken too many pills that doctors sed would fix me, and didnt.  after getting negative results from tests doctors gave me my mom started wondering if it was because of what i was eating.  not only did i always had really bad stomach paisn but i was always tired and alot of times when i would stand up i would balck out for a minute or my vision woudl go really blurry. well we finally figured it out. i have a eating disorder. not until today did i realize that i would only eat junk, or i just wouldnt eat at all. im never hungry because of the sickness so basicully i just never got better cuz i woudl always stop eating.  i just feel really stupid that it took me so long to realize something that i was doing to  myself.  at the moment im not hungry and i feel kinda sick but im gona go eat anytway even though i dont want to. :/


anyway something good is that for proabably one of the first times in my life im glad to have a brother :) recently me and dan have been getting along good, and i cant remember the last time we had a argument and he is actually pretty fun and nice person to be around.  i always tell them i wish i had a sister but now im not so sure about that. o yeah and as for matt...uh..yeah. ::rolls eyes::"

"event","well obviously today is Xmas, and it sucks cuz i talked to a couple  people that arent having the best day, and i want to change that.  im not the best person at brightening up my own day but i hope i can just help  everyone else have a nice day.  people have been asking me what i got and i usually just sed ""stuff""...but i wasnt lieing..it is JUST stuff. this year i guess i just feel the true ""spirit "" of christmas hehe..as corny as that may sound.

 well tomorow i hope i can sleep over tracys house. also i want to see ""the return of the king"" sometime this week and im not sure what else im doing.>>somebody make plans with me<< yeah.

  well anyway right now im at my G'moms house (boorrring) and me and dan are watching this really crappy ""horror"" movie on digital cable called ""jack frost"" its about a snow man that goes on a killing spree in hawaii. it might just be the fucking funniest movie i have ever seen. its made by a amature filmaker and the snow man gtes his parts (carrot, coal , ice cubes..) and creeps around the iland and doing such things like the carrot pushes a anvil on a girl, another girl swallows a icecube and her head explodes, and i guy gets a snowball throw at him by the snow mand and his arms fliess off and starts squirting blood all over everyone. everyone shoudl check it out. definatly oscar worthy. 

also i got a new digital camera and i guess thats the ""big"" gift. so if anyone sees me smile so i can take your picture and eventually get it in my journal. k?. :)"

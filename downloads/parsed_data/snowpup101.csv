"event","You know, nameing a hill after rattlesnakes is brilliant. The only reason I say that is that the hill near my house that is just AWESOME is called Rattlesnake Hill. My brother named it. One of the kids that I babysit showed me a place on Rattlesnake Hill that is a huge hole that is awesome. My sister, friend, and I are making it our ""clubhouse"" because is pretty big and hidden. It is deeper than I am tall. 


P.S I added some more pics to my ELijah collage, after I'm done I'm going to take a picture of it to show you."

"event","I tried hangin' with a different group and they were really nive to me!! They even gave me their AIM screen names! So practice wasn't entirly good, there was a dog that got away from its owner, a kid no more than 7 years old, so I stopped and helped. Practice was alomost over so I though it would be okay. I mean seriously, have you ever had a dog get away from you? Its scary. Sometimes you aren't sure wether you're going to get it back, the kid was frantic. The dog ran straight towards me so I grabbed its collar and walked it back to the kid. My team was screaming at me!!!!!! ""Get back here!"" ""leave the dog alone!"" ""Let the do runaway!"" THey didn't understand. THe kid was frantic and I felt really sorry for him so I helped him. Urgh. My team is sooo insensitive. *sighs*. Another reason that they are insensitive is this: A kid on our team has a huge lump on her throat. It makes it hard to breathe and/or swallow. She was in tears because she couldn't breathe so two kids decided to escort her off the feild. The coach went into fits and said, ""she doesn't need help. Get back here!"" He made us do two extra sprints because they helped her!!!!!!!!!!!! Then when they got back Pippi, thats her nickname, started yelling, ""OMG! you made us do two extra sprints!"" I'm all, ""Pippi, chill. THey were helping a teammate."" The sprints weren't very long, just five of 'em up a small hill.
Okay, so while i'm writing I'll tell you this: a kid asked me out!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's a sweet kid. I feel so loved!!! School was better 'cuz i hung out with different kids. I don't know him very well but I talk to him occaionally."

"event","You know what sitnks? When everything you are looking forward to and the one thing you're dreading is on. I was liiking forward to going to boulder w/my orchestra but that was cancelled. Then I was all, ""at least I have my soccer game to look forward to"" and guess what? My game was cancelled too. Life sucks sometimes. Oh, yeah that reminds me, Katie and Kristin made no effort to contact me on the snow day and then my my only neighborhood friend got grounded. SHe's grounded until May 23rd or something like that because she's grounded till the end of the school year. I guess the reminder of this year, that was I swear a taste of living hell, will be spent in front if the computer or engrossed in a book. I read the book that inspired the movie, ""The Ring"". It was kinda odd, but good. I haven't seen the movie, is it any good? Anyways, I have to go."

"event","Urgh, my school district is soooooooo stupid!!!!!!! I was supposed to go on an orchestra tour with my school orchestra <I play violin> but noooooooo they just canceled it because of one damn inch of snow!!! If they decided to delay or cancel school it would be canceled, of course they decided to cancel school. At least it wasn't just a delay so I would have to go to school on top of it all. ARRGH! Sometimes they don't even DELAY when there is a FOOT of snow. It is sooooooooooooooo stupid!!! I know, I repeated myself alot but I am VERY annoyed."

"event","What is the point in life? To make a difference? How the heck are we supposed to do that? I know! I know! helping someone up from the ground after they've tripped, write a note to somebody with now friends, or support somebody through hard times. This is what I think that we are supposed to do in life along with getting good grades. But what does school matter if all we're supposed to do is help people? School is there to help you learn so you can graduate from helping someone up to curing their sickness if you are a doctor, or discovering a new virus and warning people if you are a scientist. You could even help people design their houses. Yes some careers help people more than others, but every little thing counts. I think that the people in Hell are murderers and buiness owners that do nothing other than order people around all day and getting rich from other people's effort. If there is a Hell, if there is even life after death. I think that the only kind of life after death that I would appreciate would being able to experience different things. Sometimes being a plain old human gets to be REALLY dull. Most of us don't realize the meaning of life, those who do, like GANDHI, only occasionly act upon the knowledge. Life after death would be awesome if you could experience things like being an animal, being able to make things levitate with the swish and flick of a magic wand, but being able to keep all your own memories. In the religion that people do belive you come back to life as something else but don't keep your own memmories and knowledge. I wish I could be me but a different me, if you get what I'm saying.

P.S A kid at my school got a cutting utensil stuck up into his cheekbone.
P.P.S It was really gross.
P.P.P.S I'm supposed to be typing an essay.
P.P.P.P.S Harry Potter Rox!"

"event","There is a theory out there that always seems to get some people peeved. This is: answer bad with good. Why should you do this? Well I should think that this is obvious: the more good, the less bad. If someone insults you I'm not saying that you have to compliment them, just ignore it, don't retaliate. I know that I am bullied and I just recently figured out how to put a stop to it: IGNORE THEM!!! They do it for the reaction... If there is no reaction, the bullying will become less. So, answer bad with good. Come on, help someone out... If someone is getting bullied then defend them, or tell someone."

Then, three or more hours later I go outside only to find packages on the doorstep. This usually means that they are being delivered in the DARK. Not to mention that my cousin had a package delivered to the SIDE of her house. Not the porch, not anywhere near the door, but on the side. The only reason it was found was because her grandson tripped over it. While I appreciate the postal services zeal to deliver the goods, I can't help but think that there's a fundamental sorting problem going on."

"event","I've been thinking about Supernatural lately. Hey, what else should I be doing? 

<lj-cut text=""My thoughts this way"">I don't buy that Dean has no hunger. In my opinion Dean's hunger is to avert the apocalypse -kill/imprison Lucifer. Like Famine's going to indulge that. Of course, Famine obviously didn't see Sam's desire for the same and so we have two Horsemen down. And, after this episode, I'm pretty damn sure I don't want to see what the powers that be have in mind for Pestilence.

Regarding the apocalypse as a whole, I believe that it's a test for the angels, one that they are failing miserably. Well, with one notable exception. And, if I'm lucky, Gabriel will get with Winchester's the program but I'm not holding my breath.

As for the whole: There's no free will. I say, ""Bullshit"". If everything is so damn predetermined then why are the angels trying so very, very, hard to make it happen? If all roads lead to the apocalypse then why not sit back and let it happen? Again, I think this is part of the angel's test.

Almost forgot. Castiel said that his vessel craved red meat. There are cases (go ahead, google) of organ donor recipients who start to crave things that their donors once loved. So, until Jimmy makes an appearance, I'll continue to believe that he's gone on to his reward.</lj-cut>"

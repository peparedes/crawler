I can't even put the words to the feelings but this feels so much like the lesson I am struggling so hard to learn and do.  If not the biggest lesson then one of them for sure.  To me the purity of feeling in his voice in this cut in particular is awe inspiring in the Hebrew sense of the word: part admiration, part wonder, part fear."

"event","I'm looking on behalf of a friend who is going to be forced to live out of her truck for the summer to save up money for damage deposit, first month's rent, and general reserve.  Through no fault of hers, the apartment she was at got severely smoke damaged by a fire in the unit across the hall from hers. The apartment she had was barely tolerable to start with.  The replacement is worse.  She gave notice and wants to move out.  What she wants is basically to pay $100-200/mo for at a minimum a level place to park and a place to plug in her extension cord and the bit of electricity she needs to recharge her laptop and a couple other things.  She will pay the higher amount in that range if she can also negotiate some access to kitchen and bathrooms.

She's got a job and in fact was promoted lately and her work situation is as good as it's been in years.  I'm not mentioning her name because it would be bad for her promotion prospects if this got out at work. (office politics, feh) She can just barely make ends meet at the best of times, she can't _afford_ to take on debt.  She's done this living out of the vehicle thing before.  I've lived with her for a month and visited her a couple times since. We're not lovers, so I'm not biased here, I think.  She's a smart, hardworking person. 

The ""worst"" that can be said of her is I suspect she's on the autistic spectrum (her opinion is ""that would explain a lot, if tests ever showed that I'd believe it""). So she makes a steady trickle of faux pas and failures to catch things which causes some incidents evoking eye rolling annoyance on the parts of others.  But as far as I can see she's never been anything but willing to make amends if given the chance.  She does ""get"" social reciprocity and feel an obligation to heed the feelings of others.  Just there seldom seems an avenue to negotiate that.  If I'm wrong as to the cause, this is at any rate the only negative pattern in dealing with her: she makes occasional serious errors of social common sense.

(This is why she's not bothering trying to find an actual room.  All her shared situations have gone awry and she wants to stay socially at arm's length, polite but aloof and noninteractive with her hosts as much as practical.)

So anyone know anyone who might be interested who has driveway space? it's only three-four months...she's a sweet, ethical, hardworking person who's had a difficult time in life because of the social-common sense stuff."

quote from Cracked's list of ""6 Animals that don't give a f*ck""

re: the mongoose

f they allowed bets on interspecies rivalries, we'd lay our money square on the snake, every time. And we would lose that money, for one very simple reason: because the mongoose isn't fighting snakes for food, or for territory, or for survival -- it's fighting snakes because <i>f*ck snakes</i>. That's seriously the reason why: Occasionally you will see a mongoose eating the meat from a defeated snake, but as a general rule, they prefer to avoid it. Yet they still actively seek out and hunt snakes, oftentimes ones larger than themselves.



Logically, I know this makes no sense why I am finding that so absolutely hilarious.  The other two cases were:
The stick figure animation to the infamous ""Onyxia wipe"" recording (from WoW)
The super abridged version of Wheel of Time's first 10 or 11 books (http://www.ataricommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=386600)

The wipe video had me in stitches because of the imaginative, minimalistic humorous graphics juxtaposed with the absurdity of a raid leader whose raid didn't know the plan before they started, who either gives too much detail or too little detail and is oblivious to the fact he is not God's gift to gamers.  The tears started when he's going ""I want DoT's, (animation of a stick figure throwing a cloud of pretty polka dots) more DoT's (same animation, bigger cloud) (a few more instructions) MORE DoT's! (HUGE cloud of dots thrown by the stick figure, think they panned back to show them maybe)

ISAM had me struggling not to make noise and wake other passengers on the bus because it does mercilessly and very concisely expose most of the idiot balls, fridge logic and just plain bad writing in one of my favorite series. And I was laughing partially because I hadn't realized how many there WERE, and partially because I kinda knew all along it wasn't the best written series, but I hadn't stopped to really parse _why_ this was so.  The tone is wonderfully droll.

The mongoose thing, I really am not sure right now why I lost it so much.  My guess is because that attitude...racist, bigoted possibly genocidal hatred projected onto an animal...contrasted to the blithely confident judgment ""Of course the snake will win"" underlines an impression of pure wtf by the writer.  But I already knew the mongoose had the edge.  So partly it was sadistic ""you go mongoose!"" feeling... I mean, I like both animals.  It just seemed clear to me the snake would lose way more often than it would win.  Ironically, my reasoning why might have been quite flawed itself.  Also, I found the image of this nigh-psychotic mongoose just consumed with snake hatred funny because I can't think of any other case where predators _routinely_ end up locked in combat just to have a fight.  I mean, more than a skirmish of the stronger scaring the weaker off.  So the hypothesized contradiction of my take on predator-predator relations amused me.

I hope others are amused by the quote or the other two cases of stuff that made me laugh enough to cry. 

(Which made me check if wiki has any comments why it evolved this way they don't say.)"

"event","My parents are both fairly perceptive about politics in general and specific ploys politicians use to mislead and manipulate in particular.  I remember when I was studying Nazi Germany in World War II history class and somehow Mom noted this ""one of the cleverest things Hitler did was to quickly identify himself as the driving force behind national salvation...and that being opposed to his policies thus made you a bad German.""  It is true despite this he had a LOT of Germans unhappy with him and defiant all throughout the war (this was the source of much Allied intelligence gathering...)  But really when you stop and think about it, that definitely was a big thing all the same and certainly helped keep dissent from reaching epic proportions as he mismanaged the country into the ground.

The reason this springs to mind is I was picking at the memoirs of Albert Speer lately. And I realized ""I think it would be best not to be seen reading this in public, political discourse has become so debased a random stranger might conclude I'm a freaking Nazi sympathizer.""  And I was thinking over possible defenses and my mom's comment came to mind. ""My mom said the cleverest thing Hitler did to get people behind the bad things he did was to convince them that doing otherwise was being a bad German.  Now we're living on a continent dominated by a country that is preaching nonstop (and often at gunpoint) that disagreeing with American security measures or demanding American accountability for the nasty things they've done means you're a terrorist.  I'm reading about the history of the Nazis because I want to understand how I ended up living in this messed up situation and see if there's any obvious weak points in their machine"".

(Of course, I count myself lucky that I have no friends I'd need to make this defense to.  Despite the fact that at least 1/3 of my friends have strong political differences with me.)"

"event","okay, there's this moderately amusing webcomic, http://www.egscomics.com  It's kind of like Buffy crossed with Parker Lewis Can't Lose and a bit of the Tuck saga.   I just had one of the only times I've felt good about the world around me in recent years.  There's this silly bit in the gaming shop where this character works.  He ends up drawing attention to the fact he's gay for the reader's benefit, but apparently a few of the shop's patrons too.  That sets the stage for :

http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2003-03-12

Attn: The bit where the kid says ""I'm not out to bash you or anyone else for being different; X Men have taught me better than that.""

I just had to give a huzzah and pump my fist in the air after reading that :)

For perspective, when I first got to college, Northstar was made gay as a publicity stunt, first gay character in mainstream comics at that point. (Remember the comment at the time ""oooh, they made one of Marvel's most irritating characters gay, thanks a lot guys!"")  That was only 20 years ago.  An eyeblink in sociological terms.

I was just reading last night how a couple of mutant chars in one of the X franchise pretended to be gay to mess with people and be into each other.  But then they decided they were gay, but not into each other :)  And I realized ""wow.  being queer is getting close to being a routine character trait rather than a stunt/ploy/token.  It's even gotten to the X Men, the backbone of Marvel's print operations!""  Damned.  It still sucks how much the fundies want to kill everyone like me or at least make us very sorry we were ever born unless we admit we're naughty children and marry and breed like good like drones....but damned.

I mean, not long after Northstar came out, I did.  It was 1991-92 school year, there was national coming out day.  And I realized ""I'm in a liberal university living on campus in a school with a firm equal rights policy in the most cosmopolitan, affluent city in my province which is really the most socially unconventional province in the country, overall.  If I can't get over my fear of persecution and 'show the flag' and help make people see we're everywhere while living here and now, I'll NEVER feel safe enough"".  So I did, and in typical autistic tactless fashion sewed a pink triangle on my jacket :)  When I got back home for summer vacation, I was a little nervous, but I was ready to risk being beaten or spit at or whatever.  I think I was home about a week when mom ripped it off my jacket while I was asleep and she berated me not to go making myself a target.  

Mom for the record isn't homophobic but it wasn't till a couple years after I came out that she really examined her own conditioning and agreed it was stupid.  She did note she'd probably always feel a little uneasy about the queer thing just because of how deep the conditioning went.   But I'm just sharing this because I'm seriously bemused. First, how fast twenty years passes @_@  But more that even in my hometown, which is one of the most conservative towns in the province, to be fair, I probably wouldn't get more than some black looks or catcalls these days.  Probably have problems renting there or getting a job (I mean, presuming I was an otherwise reasonable hire) but it wouldn't be impossible by any means. (And I may not be giving them credit, I need to ask my friend who's still living there)  Kids probably are out while going to school at least some of the time and while it's probably not fun for that brave handful, _it's a realistic choice_.  When I went to school, NO ONE was ""out"" at school.  No one even hinted they were.

Damned. Society changed for the better while I wasn't looking.  Too little, too late.  I still think the species is doomed by its stupidity.  But it's nice to be reminded things aren't all bad in all ways about the hairless apes....weirder still I was a tiny part of a positive change.  How odd."

"event","Back in the late seventies, when Punk Rock was the dominant form of rebellious music, a bunch of musicians came to a realisation that led to the creation of a new genre. The conversation went a bit like this:

First: Shit, I just realised something!
Second: What, you're drunk?
First: No, I realised that punk rock... has too much music in it! People listen to it!
Second: Your point being?
Third: Actually, that's a very good question. What's your point, man?
First: Look, what if we made the ultimate form of rebellious music by resisting conformity to musical standards?
Second: Eh?
First: What if we made anti-music?
Second: ...
Third: That might work, actually.

... these guys decided to combine Electronic Music with punk (the mentality of punk, anyway), then attempt to make it unlistenable so that they could rebel. Or something.

Except, their plan backfired. People liked this form of music...

-->from ""Industrial Music"" tvtropes entry

I laughed myself silly at that since this pretty much describes Einstuerzende Neubauten's Kollaps perfectly.  Even _fans_ call the album borderline unlistenable.


...of course I'm not sure how many of my friends have listened to Industrial...

It reminds me of a quote from a WKRP episode where a hoodlum rock band comes in for an interview as part of a promotion.
 
""So what's the difference between hoodlum rock and say punk rock?""

""Well, for one thing, they dress deplorably. [the band is dressed in sharp 3 piece suits]
[beat]
Second, they don't actually attack their audiences.
[drummer pipes up] We don't like audiences.""

I'd say it was impossible except it seems you also have problems going broke overestimating the masochism of your demographic sometimes...As an aside has anyone ever been horrified by a movie or book that they innocently tried out not expecting something soul chilling...to such a degree they either didn't finish or vowed never to see/read/think about it again? (ah for brain bleach...)

For me, The Cube definitely counts.  Not so much for the existential horror or the gorn.  Rather because it just seemed to have an _atmosphere_ that to me summed up the worst nightmares of modern society.  For books, Angel Fire East by Terry Brooks.  That is so far the ONLY novel I put down for being too grim.  There's been novels I didn't read the protagonist chapters for till last.  Novels I read very slowly and unenthusiastically in places.  But that was the first where the author described the hero getting so horribly ganked and tested by God I put it down saying ""your dream shows you that you might betray your vows and turn to evil.  I'd say you should.  If good can only win by breaking your soul utterly, it doesn't deserve to win""."

"event","I've had a few stories that have had a huge impact on my life in non religious literature (the nature of the impact of religious stories differs because the wrestling with the unanswerable and unspeakable dominates the narrative more because religion is focused and pointed toward that struggle.  Not to say that regular stories don't do that too sometimes, but it's a bit like erotica.  You expect a balance between narrative and sex.  Regular stories have almost no sex or cursory sex.  Erotic fiction has a mix of story and sex.  Pornography has almost no story or cursory story...)  V For Vendetta (graphic novel), Fight Club (the movie), Grendel (the comic series, Christine Spar and her boyfriend), the end of The Gathering Storm, The Crow (graphic novel), Atlas Shrugged (because it taught me the law of unintended consequences and that nothing was as simple as it looked at first glance.  The rest of it was only meaningful as an illustration of the axiom ""you have an idea, an ideology has you"")...

Really now that I think about it, there's not so many that have had a big impact on me as to how I think or perceive the world in one shot.  Bits and pieces have come along the way to be sure...but not big heavy shoves like those.  I think I may have gotten my next shove...ironically from all places in the form of the anime Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.  I won't go into what the shove was except that suddenly I think I understand what Buddha was getting at , roughly, when he said ""all things are impermanent"".  When I first heard it, I hated it for what I thought was an embrace or endorsement of futility.  I should have realized that the fear that everything was in vain was what I was hearing instead.  It's a loud distraction to hear through to be sure.

But what struck me is that if I just showed this to friends who don't watch anime, even if I gave them a briefing sheet on anime storytelling conventions and tropes...I don't think it would mean much to them.  Because there is a sort of...ambiance, an atmosphere, a milieu, something that's hard to describe...involved with _any_ passionate pursuit.  Sports, politics, religion, anime, stamp collecting...403 mentioned something about ""mirroring""...it's a psychological phenomena.  It describes how people get most of their cues as to how to react and much of their motivation to bear hardship or strive from imitation of those around them.  I think very much part of the lens I saw this anime through was the particular feelings and sensibilities I knew that the people I watched it with had.  It's like, in order to appreciate these things fully, you partially dissolve your own innate reactions in the reactions you see others having.  Your own reaction is still real but it is twisted and braided through the forces of the perceived reactions others have to the material.  At least, so it is with me anyway.  And this in turn lends a sort of vividness to the experience that does not apply to things that are just you by yourself..."

We're living in a police state.  The fact that most people are too tired and harried to rattle the bars of the cage doesn't change the fact we exercise our rights on _sufferance_ not on a basis of _law_.  Law is always an aspiration more than achievement but we are sliding steadily into an abyss of arbitrary, unaccountable authority.  If you can spare anything, spare $5.00 to help these people and remind others around you that if we thought it was worth _killing people_ to protect ""Libyan citizens simply seeking to assert their rights"" what does that say about what we should be doing now, hrm?"

I hadn't been excluded because of a lack of willingness to disclose/share data with me. Both have trusted me with their life and shown they'll do anything to save my own.  The reason I wasn't included was because it was wordlessly agreed I was too optimistic and lacked a background in grappling with the level of grimness they were discussing so it was unlikely I'd have any useful suggestions and it would just horribly depress me and make me anxious to listen in.

Maybe I'm learning the beginnings of mercy and acceptance without endorsement.&nbsp; The world is still horribly fucked up, but it needs space and forgiveness to purify itself just as much as&nbsp; I do...."

I remember that we killed 16 million people and wounded (often grievously) another 21 million.  They died and were hurt fighting for the interests of the rich and privileged.  

I remember that the soldiers involved ultimately were fighting for their squads or companies, not their armies or countries.  

I remember that by the first Christmas the soldiers on the front line felt they had more in common with each other than their civilian population back home

I remember that the precious ""national autonomy"" the major powers fought for was never at risk on _any_ front.  Look at the peace in the East in 1917.  And the lot of minor powers has always been to be trading cards between the major.

I remember we had World War II because the Western Allies wanted to arm Hitler to fight the Russians.  If we hadn't paid for his rearmament, his war machine would not have been in the league to do what it did, even with the greatest geniuses in history leading it.

I remember that our soldiers weren't fighting to protect us from the people of other nations but the rapacious bastards on top of the social order who give them their orders.  And that if everyone refused to accept such orders, wars like this couldn't happen.

So I read their chapters with diligence and decided to cover Caligula.  Why?  Because he showed more creativity and less tendency to repeat previous ""shockers"".  In fact, in studying Western History since then, I don't think anyone barring perhaps Ivan the Terrible of Russia compares for having had the power and that level of ""out there"".  Certainly Caligula is the craziest of the most renowned (to Westerners) rulers.

you know how it is? When you're falling and falling, and there are no walls, nothing really stable around you. falling and falling. What can stop it? Just somehow. A string, or a rope A ribbon. It just grazes your fingers and you hold it. You hold it without even knowing you grabbed it. And you stop falling. You just hang there. What even puts that ribbon there, how it got there, why it's wrapped around the wrist, even if you let it go, it just is there.  

So it's grabbed. You see it and you realize ""If this breaks, if I let go. I'll plummet"". This ribbon, it just came out of no place. *nods*  There was a time ago that I realized I had this ribbon in my hands.  Clutching, and hanging, and thinking. ""Is it even possible to let these other threads wrap around me?""  And I don't know what I'm saying <murrrrs sleepily> but it's like ""is there a foothold?"" There's so much that comes with knowing there is just a ribbon.



...the trip home had a huge patch of darkness in it.  First, I hurt a friend, because I thought I knew better than they did and couldn't stand the possibilities of a choice they wanted to make differently than I wanted them to make it.  Flair's teacher says that mind magic is an obscenity beyond obscenity and I think he's right.  So just as divination is giving God the finger, so trying to coerce someone is like a five year old trying to beat someone to death with a can opener.  It probably won't do more than bruise but the intent is reprehensible.

...and some conversations I'd had with Dellar about gods and cosmology and purpose had disturbed me and I felt as bad as I had since just before Nov 23rd...

and then my purse was stolen in Victoria.  I made the whole trip back uneventfully. But I was so tired by the turmoil of my aforementioned misdeed when I tried to coerce my friend (communicating through my new Sidekick on the bus)...and I was dead asleep when the bus pulled into Victoria.  And some bastard on the bus noticed, pried my purse from out of my sleeping hands and ran off with it. I tried to stop him but I didn't even remember what town I was in, I just heard someone yell ""stop"" and tried to chase the guy but I slipped and fell, and the one guy who tried to chase him down was too slow.  Ironically, the sidekick fell out of my purse, and my charger was in my pocket.

But the purse had $700.00 inside.  And all my identity documents except birth certificate and name change record.  Because I had taken the rent money down across the border with me in case the border guards pulled that '$50.00 a day in your pocket or we turn you back' bullshit.  And I was going to mail it to my landlord but I hate fussing with money orders and mail and so I phoned and asked to western union it to him and he said ""ah, pay me when you're back on the 18th"".  And I got repaid $300.00 by Dee so I could get my next ticket.  I've known for years I have to take precautions when carrying a lot of money. I never did. I'd taken strong risks a few times and not suffered for it.

I was not a happy camper.

But I got home, talked to Luci online and just said I needed to be held and...she did something somehow and I felt myself _dragged_ out of the rut I was falling into. And then she did something similar again tonight.  Not with sex.  Just warmth and the need for things to be better than they were. I didn't fall very far, but her words, ruminating about her own experiences the last year or two...echoed my own. and maybe of others.  I certainly will work this image into what strange prayers I still articulate.

I am richer than I ever have been in my life."

All I can say is I have kept true to my intent to not give up the task entirely and move on to something else...just gone super inefficient at times.  But so far so good, got the messiest part of my desk clean which has to be done first so I can unplug my computer and move everything out of my room. then when it's all out, I have to scrub down every surface and then scrub a second time with sage soap.  But here's the breaking news worth commenting on:

Sometimes my brain parses something slow but I don't feel that horrible gnawing anxiety that marks all similar processes I've ever done (this is equivalent to me moving out of my room, pretty much, labor wise).  Yar!

So it'll get done...just possibly a long time from now. but it will get done damn it.  This matters a lot not just because of the stress effects of living with so much clutter or the embarrassment of losing a pile of stuff ""on the top layer"" because the top layer ceased to be the top layer o_O  It matters because I really do feel I sweated a lot of pain into this room and its time to clean it if only for symbolic value.  I'm not sick anymore and I shouldn't be living in an invalid's sickroom.  (Of course, I'm not HUGELY talented yet, but I'm working on that. It's coming :)  Considering that trying to meditate for relaxation in April for two minutes sent me into a funk of depression and self destruction that took THREE MONTHS to settle, I think I'm pretty proud that meditation is quite an experience now, and takes up at least an hour of my day and really helps get me consolidated and intent.)

Right now the last preparation is music to listen to while working.  I am bemused and sad that I had to absolutely scour my collection to get even 1/4 of a gig of positive or neutral music. Now, to be fair, my collection's only 2 or 3 gigs but still >_<  However, I am happy on another count.  I was listening to Rav's DJ show (Thursdays, 5-7PM pacific) on SL at Alt7 club and he was playing ""Boys Don't Cry""...someone commented they love the Cure's ""A Forest"".  I commented ""that song's about as spooky as I can handle the Cure now...in fact, it makes me shudder to think of listening to Faith or Pornography"" [the two albums after the album on which A Forest is, based on Robert Smith's early days as a heroin addict.] ""well you don't have to....""

""Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand, because extroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in voluble, and frequently inescapable, interaction with other people.  They are as inscrutable as puppy dogs.""


....and extroverts are the majority (sometimes the vast majority depending on the field) of all managers and administrators.  And this is why I find work torturous.  Because they're making it crystal clear in every single interaction what their nature is.  I really don't like typical ""human nature"".  I _really_ loathe ""managerial human nature"".  And the fact they have authority and renumeration and status over me makes part of me go ""... the world keeps putting these socio-emotional perverts in power over me, the fact I'm here right now having my nose rubbed in their ickiness...why did I f*ck up again? How could I not avoid this fate again? This is so horrible and it keeps happening over and over....""

(Note to self: redouble all efforts on shielding, good sleep patterns, holding vigilant intentions to stay out of reflexive thinking, and emotion control.)

I may well be kinda extroverted myself.  ""Working out who they are in voluble, inescaple"" ways is very me, I have to admit.  I still think I'm relatively hard to figure out...but I think that's just because I have very intricate specific response patterns within some generally obvious themes of my behaviour.  So its not that I'm saying extroversion is bad.  But it does magnify any social friction I have with a person a lot.   Again, strangled laugh, no wonder work sucks so much for me.

And I'm pretty puppy doggish to some people (giggles)  In fact, I am struck by the irony that the reason why regular managers don't like me is because while I do control my verbal expression around them somewhat, everything else about me is making it clear what I think and feel of the situation.  And some of them are very pissed by that.  And the type of people who will appreciate will appreciate me a lot because if they don't really like me, getting ""what I am"" at such volume will push them away :)"

And that's in its own way as dangerous as being purely a pawn of your emotions (shout out to Nancy for showing that one).  But I think there are three major parts
(1) Extracting info from negative feelings, soothing and quelling them aside or asleep or recycling the energy from them.
(2) Creating a mood from nothing
(3) Transforming an existing negative or undesired mood to an equal or greater intensity mood without having to cycle through tracking down all the sub components.

""But clearly, there exists some threshold of horror awful enough that God will intervene."" (re: his sense of ""when does God's non intervention become too problematic to bear"")

For me what proved ""too horrible a thing for God to allow"" was simple: if a metaphysical act was the cause of irreparable human suffering or destruction.  I simply cannot accept that metaphysical layer would be flawed and imperfect.  Why? _because that layer is our interface with God_.  If the layer is cracked or warped we can't always fulfill whatever it is God put us here to do.  Why? Because religion states we cannot fulfill our purpose without a clear connection to God.  If 
   humans do not have metaphysical abilities
   and metaphysical factors are sometimes the _margin of failure_ to fulfill a life's purpose
   then humans who fail on account of metaphysical reasons fail because God's work stopped them.

This is totally incompatible with the only monotheistic definitions of God I can accept.  I don't care how rare it is, if ""grievous in the eyes of the Lord are the death of His faithful"" then a wasted life is a tragedy beyond compare.  And a life wasted _because God's work is responsible for wrecking it_ is an obscenity. (It's not that we are ASSURED fulfillment of our purpose.  But that uncertainty makes divine intervention against humanity utterly intolerable to me.)

Ironically, it has been my healing that has destroyed my faith in God.  Thankfully, I don't need that anymore.

Because I didn't heal because someone gave me good advice.  I didn't heal because I was smart and dedicated to solving my problems.  I didn't heal because of light boxes or medication or a health food diet cured me.  I healed because I exploited metaphysical laws.  As far as I can see there is broad agreement by many of my friends that:

(a) however you feel about the universe, good or bad, seems to be how you will be treated in your life: good or bad
(b) decisions substantiated by deeds make the world a person lives through.  Decisions that do not agree with aims or decisions without adequate substantiation have a negative or null impact.
(c) emotions can be controlled, but only if someone learns this control is possible. It is not an innate and automatic property of being human. 


How did I know this was what cured me? Because these are the only factors I changed.  I didn't even change them very strongly.  But I put my effort into making those changes and it was like everything that was impossible before has started to become possible.  Enough changes have happened I have no reason to think they are transitory.

How do I know these changes did not operate in some psychological fashion? Well, first, much of psychology is so non scientific it might as well be metaphysical. Second, two events determined my success.  

One, I burned sage to drive off evil spirits _when everything I knew in every way said it should fail_ I mean both rational views _and_ ""crazy ideas about metaphysics"".  Yet doing this improved my state of mind enough that I succeeded in learning Lesson #1: I control my emotions.  My mood only improved the night of the lesson to allow the learning because I had done this. (admittedly this was the smallest factor yet it is clear to me I was heading the wrong way with the mood I was in when the day started.)

Two, I had a series of emotional lessons that expanded this first step radically.  These lessons only happened because I met Flair and decided to be her student in magic.  The first lesson which I learned for myself (that my emotions could be controlled) would have been inadequate because it contained no clues how to _quickly_ induce purely emotional learning. As a boggling side note: to the degree Flair's words directly impacted me _none of the change inducing ideas were new_.  I'd heard everything in terms of emotional and perceptual management from at least one other person before.  Often many people.

(When I say emotional lessons I mean when you know something is right objectively and you can't make yourself believe it emotionally no matter what you think.  For example, I knew that logically my parents didn't hate me.  I could never believe it _until_ an emotional event happened that told me ""my parents SHOULD be merciful, their mercy to me is _natural_ not an _aberration_."")

The thing is, its all about emotions.  Everything I've learned tells me that yes, evil spirits are a _large_ influence on emotions.  Not the largest, but a big enough influence that evil spirits + bad decisions == irreparably f*cked up life for some significant percentage of the sample of living people.  I had nearly been such a case.  And logically, such cases exist. I suffered because a metaphysical fact was the margin by which I was not able to learn the lesson about emotional control.  Without emotional control, reasons ( a ) and usually ( b ) mean I would have been scourged.  Being scourged created negative emotions.  Evil spirits came and made those emotions worse.  Rinse, repeat for 23 years.  I presumed this was the cycle and I could break the cycle through that presumption as opposed to the abject failure of  23 years of trying everything else.

I am actually happy with the universe again.  I would be happier if there were a God as I believed in during my time with Judaism.  But the mechanism that permitted my healing is not a uniform blessing.  That mechanism is all too often a horrible source of unavoidable human suffering.   So that's why I'm done with God. As Eliezer said, something sufficiently awful came to my attention that God was obligated to stop.  Yet God, if God exists, is the cause.

I am glad Flair gave me a basis to believe in another type of divinity so that I did not have to believe I lived in a universe dominated by an evil God.

I only wrote the entry because I wanted to give praise to how to the point Eliezer's quote is. It absolutely describes the heart of a complex but sudden collapse of belief.   Just because he'd call me a fool is no reason not to praise his artistry and intellect :)  It also seemed a good opportunity to explicitly map out a critical turning point in my life.

Tragic aside: as far as I can tell, there's only two ways that magic ever becomes a huge influence in one's life.  Either a power out there wants you, contacts you and you accept their patronage with full consent.   Or you are faced with a calamity of a fate even worse than your own death.  Ironically, though Eliezer would hate me for citing him in support of irrationality, http://lesswrong.com/lw/nb/something_to_protect/ sums up the principle by which the second clause works.  This unfairness above all convinces me of the nonexistence of a monotheistic God.  You simply can't _choose_ to face a fate worse than death.  Yet we're in a world where magic is sometimes the only thing that can save us from endless horror.

"event","I don't actually talk to my teacher much.  The current lesson is extremely simple:
Go into a place where at a bare minimum you're touching grass or raw earth, preferably with a tree or two nearby, and just be still.  Don't have to be barefoot but if you like that, do it.  Listen.   Do that as often as seems a good idea.  As I mentioned before ""If it starts to feel like a chore, you're doing it wrong"".

But she has another student and I was talking to her about developments with him.  The other student is a prodigy.  I call him Neo o_O  He resisted this at first but as I'm pointing out to him the amazing things he can do, he's reluctantly accepting this.  And Neo's pretty young and his mom and dad aren't 100% keen on their ""baby"" talking to a 39 year old on disability.  I commented ""At least Neo's dad is slowly starting to think I'm a good influence.  I guess he just figures I'm a freak but a harmless freak"".

(The irony that its like Neo and I are akin to study partners in the Jewish sense of the learning process and Flair as our ""Rabbi"" just makes me chortle horribly.  I will never cast aside or denegate the the good things I learned through Judaism. One day, when I forgive G*d for not existing, I'll probably do some Torah study again, maybe even Talmud.)

Flair said one of the longest sentences she would in this conversation ""You know, you're not a freak"".  And it just slowly dawned on me she was right.  Like, I maintain consciously that I am unashamed of what I am and if the world has a f*cking issue they can go to Hades.  However, not too far under the skin that's just how I feel.  A freak.  And I resent the world horribly for making me feel that way.

I just sort of thought about this.  And I decided to do a sage purification and another sage-rosemary soap shower.  I wondered if it would be like the one in the last entry.  It was even better.  And it highlighted to me several key points that boil down to : moment to moment vigilance is difficult at first but is ultimately the very best thing, because quiet, tiny feelings synergize dramatically, and if they're bad feelings then you end up blinded to the fact the synergy has happened.  

And I do feel like less of a freak now and I think I'll be done with that in the forseeable future.

Second bit:

I had made a promise to give nurturing to a friend I had fallen out of touch with.  Flair gave me help making sure I was doing the right thing.  She agreed that he could benefit by what I wanted to do.  But...he and I have a bit of a checkered past (no, he's not anyone I ever mentioned in LJ, because he was one of the last people I visited RL _before_ starting LJ.  (I mean, the first time, as Strangess).  We have some powerful similarities and potential to please each other.  And some powerful dissonances that strikes sparks.  So since he used an instant messenger program I don't use for anyone else...and he got off to three spark-strikes with me in 24 hours of promising this...and he said he didn't expect to hear much from me till I visited physically again...well, I'm busy these days so I just didn't talk to him at all.

This was bad.  Fortunately, he was finally bold enough after a week or so to ask Flair what was up with me.  She simply said (man, she's terse online) ""Someone's concerned about you"".  and zip,into a messenger conference.  And I see him and go ""aaaw f*ck"" in my head as I realize that I've basically so far broken my promise of assistance.  And...Flair's pretty strict about keeping promises, like, about anything serious. Things the Little Prince would TRULY regard as ""Matters of Consequence"".  And I had a moment of real terror before I saw it and got on top of it.  Terror she'd turn her back on me for this.  She'd made it clear that duties to someone you take on as being ""in your care"" are paramount.  And after that terror, then I had some serious mortification at having done so badly by my old friend.  I was experiencing true contrition, not just the flash of attrition I started with. 

But I did kinda keep a lid on it. Not hugely well, but sorta ok.  And suddenly I felt this sensation in my chest, like I was falling and an electrical shock for about half a second or so.  I asked her ""Was that your wolf that nipped me or mine?"" ""Mine"" ""thank you""
and I improved my control a couple more critical notches. (I had implored her if I ever needed correction and wasn't ""getting it"" to nip me.  She took me at my word. Huzzah!) 

Then toward the end of the conversation I was just feeling bad about how this was just the biggest mishap in me doing the Listen stuff right. Because Listen isn't just about meditating.  For me, what I've learned is to sense the natural balance and try to make it the model for my internal state.  The center of my life.  I am aiming not to meditate as something I do from time to time.  Rather, when I Listen is the time I'm fully alive. The rest of my life I wish to be the way that I experience the truth of what I'm Listening too.   It's a high idea and I haven't done the best with it lately.  (Though I wasn't angsting about it.) But in the shadow of having nearly messed thing up this night... I was sobered and contrite and a bit scared.  And I felt _another_ nip but much much gentler.  Just a bare disturbance.  The minimum to get my attention.  I ask Flair ""nip again?"" ""yes"" ""thank you"".  And that helped me calm down all the way.  So I just square my shoulders and try to do things better going forward.

I've never been around ANYONE who knows how to treat me to evoke the best responses like this.  Mom was pretty good. Flair's better. And there isn't a scintilla of sex or romance involved.  Flair is pledged to Autumn and Omega.  I swear, I can _feel_ that bound stretching far far into the future.  Besides one doesn't have sex with the alpha (giggles) that's how it is for canines and that's how I feel o_O

She also reminded me, just for the cherry on top, that I had done something rare and amazing in deciding to turn my back on the darkness.  (The darkness I spent the last year mired in.)  I had braved turning away from that darkness.  Even though I was still a little scared (even on the night I met her) that I was going the wrong way.   I was still worried -even worse things- than the darkness lay ahead if I turned my back on the darkness.   Flair emphasized that I was very much a worthy student.  She noted she hadn't had to hardly do anything. I was doing all the hard work.  And she is right.  Bronze is tin, copper and antimony.  Tin is the backbone, the predominantly large portion.  But without copper and antimony, you don't have bronze.  Bronze is damned useful."

Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived-- as on all planets-- good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin-- timidly at first-- to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.

"event","<lj-cut text = ""Elaborated episode of a pleasant event with significant metaphysical undercurrents""> 

...so I finally get to take the tensor bandage off yesterday and I realize this morning ""hey, I can shower again!"" (I hurt my hand sparring on Christmas Day.  Because I'm a bit finicky I preferred to skip showering than mess around with a plastic bag over my hand or something wild eyed and practical like taking it off to shampoo, since really, the underlying injury wasn't bad, I'd just gone to emergency to make sure there were no hairline fractures or anything.)

Just after Christmas, I'd purchased some special soap made with sage and rosemary and something else.  I did this because I'd been feeling bad things poking at me spiritually.  Still, I didn't think any had really gotten in.  But I wanted to see if there was anything simple I could do to enhance my defenses.  So showering was my first chance to use the soap.  (It wouldn't be a disaster if something got in, usually bad spirits are merely the non physical version of liver flukes and tapeworms or they enhance negative emotions...but if you keep negative emotions quelled they can't do much.  All the same, there's the once in a blue moon exceptions.  Moreover, firm shields make for better mental health, too, whatever a few of my readers might think (giggles)) (Victor, the medicine man who'd given me good advice in this regard had suggested showering and using the soap.  Sage is basically penicillin for non corporeal nasties, all native societies that have it growing on their lands agree on this.)  This was thus the first chance I'd had to use it.  So I showered and washed thoroughly with the special soap.

I suppose sometime I'm going to have to go into why I think there are such things as bad spirits and that I'm not crazy for feeling some of the things I've felt lately.  The short version is: lessons 1 and 2 (see earlier journal entries) were only possible because of something consistent, metaphysical and useful that I was able to expand upon.  (Expanding upon a few very intense positive emotional experiences earlier in 2009).  Since those lessons have endured and seem to be stable and real, I'm daring to believe I'm not deluded.

The experience I had in the shower (and another one just afterward) is one of the reasons I think something real is going on.  I've been working on holding shields lately.  I usually can't sense the shields themselves though the last couple days I'd been having a few short intervals where I did.  The thing that surprised me was that I wasn't really thinking of any of that.  And suddenly not only did I feel my shields, I felt they had a sort of blue tinge stacked on top of the regular silver of the last few days. (the color's changed from time to time since I started.)  And while it didn't really thicken the shields, for some reason I felt much clearer and intent than I had in at least three days.  I hadn't even really clearly realized how fuzzy I was getting until bedtime the night before.  It wasn't the shower bringing this clarity because I was wide awake when I got in the shower and I'd been in the shower ten minutes when this feeling blossomed.  

This was more significant than it might sound.  I had been wrestling with a side effect of goodness the previous three days. The good part was that I was finally happy to start feeling safe after the harrowing stuff of Oct 2008 to late Nov 2009.  The side effect was that I was getting aimless and unfocused.  It can be easier to do things to take care of yourself when you think your safety depends on it.  At least, that's how it was for me in this case.  One thing I'd noticed is I'd been letting the ""negative emotion watchdog"" I'd set up slip.  And one of the things I'd noticed was how I felt at certain points during my meditations those days when the metaphorical watchdog was loud and strong in response to my need.  It was a feeling of clarity, kind of like just after picking up a very untidy room.  And suddenly that feeling just came over me while showering.  It was stronger than I'd ever felt it.

I followed up by meditating. The wordless state I'd arrived at a few days ago was VERY handy here.  As far as I can tell holding a clear but non verbal thought has the same sort of power in it as dreaming and perceiving something you've created in the dream that has powerful significance to you.  (That's only happened in my dreams a handful of times in my life.)  Of course, without words its hard to describe what I was meditating about.  But the long and short was I felt a sensation I've been told means the Earth is blessing me and wanting me to do well (and putting a little ""oomph"" into that wish).  This was the strongest I'd felt this blessing sensation (of three or four times I'd had it).  Again, I hadn't been steering or dictating my experience, just letting things happen.

Then the two doors down neighbour's kid who's teaching me to fight came over for a short sparring lesson.  His timing was impressive since it was something like fifteen minutes or so after I was done.  Unusually, he was staying in the back yard after getting my attention by knocking on my window.  When I came around he looked at me and commented ""wow. you like half dead or...no, like you're on crack"".  He wasn't totally serious but he was struck by the impression that I was clearly slightly out of my head.  It was a good session, though short, and just as well since we were experimenting with using firm branches as ""staves"" and I'd taken a few hits to my fingers that were stinging (thankfully I'd grabbed gloves this time).  But nothing too bad.

The thing was I wanted to just make a short note about the whole experience so I could remember it later in case I lost track of it in a spell of aimlessness or lack of focus in the future.  I was also I admit slightly proud of myself since I'd been concerned I wasn't going to be able to GET my focus back.  And I was still mildly euphoric from the showering, the meditation, and the minor but significant improvements in my sparring.

I was bemused that sparring had helped get me down to earth but not entirely since I was sure I was still grinning or otherwise looking in an odd way and very happy.  The day after this point went quite well, too, until some stupidity late at night, but I even dealt with the stupidity reasonably well.

(The title is just my bemusement that showering with the soap revealed unexpected properties of the soap or of something I was doing without thinking about it)

(I'm not going to talk about why I'm practicing physical combat except to say that no, I'm not planning to beat anyone up, and no, there is no person I've pissed off or otherwise crossed whom I am scared of.)

And I thought about that one and realized that was quite quite true.  Up until now, I don't think I've really trusted my friends as a rule (a few exceptions but only one completely.  I've submitted to them.  Thus the tension that the more sensitive ones detected.  When I met Laura last year she was almost angry and adamant that I not submit.  At the time I'd thought that was ""her stuff"" but I realize now she just couldn't stand the ambient undertone of ""am I doing it right? is this ok?""  Submitting without trust is bad.  And trust should be possible without submission.  In fact, having submission as my main dynamic of interacting with my friends is bad o_O  And it just goes on and on as I thought about that.

"event","Well, I did think to myself ""y'know, I think I'm going to regret sounding so certain and full of power and unstoppability"" in the entry I wrote on solstice (Dec 21, 2009)  The main thing is that before, my main snare between me and accomplishing things was a hovering, neverending sense of pain, fear and stress. Not always all three at once, but usually at least one.  I could at times sort of armor myself in joy against these feelings. But it was only pushing them away, not dispelling them.  But when that joy wasn't there to draw on, to the degree the joy was absent, I was chained.

Anytime I did ANYTHING there was a sense ""this is taking me away from the activities I'm using to not think about 99% of my world.  This chore, be it cooking or walking to the store, or washing my clothes or showering or looking for a job or anything? it's just between me and coping with the pain"" and I had a real fear though usually it wasn't so bad, that like, if I left my coping mechanisms, I could get _trapped_ in the world of pain and not allowed to return to a state of tolerable numbness interjected by whatever intervals of happiness I could find that rose higher than the pain (and I had a fair number of those. 1 year out of 29 years of ""lights on upstairs in my head"" overall (not all at once) was joyful.  Another three years (again, patched together) were good.)  I was so scared that I'd have to be ""awake"" and immersed in the world that made me feel this pain, fear and stress (and rage, all to often too, but that wasn't so much pain as burning myself up a millimeter at a time).

Well, my trap now is joy.  Things feel so good that I just want to bathe in this pleasure and soak in it.  But when I do interrupt my joy bath to go do something, it doesn't feel like before.  Not in the least.  One of the high points of Christmas day was the hour I spent washing dirty dishes, making food, and then washing the dishes again.  And this morning, doing the same just after rising was positively a joyful experience itself in a different way.  And while meditation I've done lately never felt bad, the last couple times it felt like an actively good thing, not just an emotionally euphonic calisthenic.  In fact, I have to be careful not to get too limited by the influences of joy echoing from that meditation.

I haven't done as much as I should but I have:
--> started working on taking care of my body
--> started cooking food for myself to improve my diet and avoid processed foods and salt
--> stopped reading while eating (and thus overeating and favoring processed, salty foods
--> learned to shield even though at first it required me to do something I HATED: doing a task that was not 100% clear and precise and did not play to strengths I could sense.

there has been one exception to the ""no fear"" part (learning to play Dawn of War, zomg, it's NOTHING like Starcraft because everything happens so fast. if RTS combat is about sort of a paper scissor rock thing, here, if you lose the pick you get SMASHED very very fast.  It was kinda traumatic for me.  The fact I kept learning despite this trauma is impressive itself, despite the fact it's just a game.  Cause the learning curve at first was stirring some feelings as bad as any in the old days.)

More will come. I just have to get better at holding my intent and not getting mired in the joy trap for 95% of the day...and learning to take enough to that joy into my constructive labor...but not so much that I lose track of what reality is or try to _preclude_ pain or the negative.  Balance, always balance: find the moving niche where I'm meant to prosper and accept all the conditions in that niche so that it welcomes me."

I have hit a bit of a stumbling block, but I'm still damned proud of what I've done and I prove the utility of it every day.  And I realized...a key part?  I have very good trance skills.  I keep asking my friends ""can you enter trance easily' and they go ""no, why would I know how to do that??""

"event","...the friends I thanked last entry:
Jeliza: quiet, quirky ,expressive and very intuitive.  Very caring person who's extremely curious and has very strong (if quiet) morals and high expectations of herself.  She's into MMO's, anime and animals and wants to be a veterinary assistant.  Lives with her father because her mom died and she feels bad about leaving him alone.  Bad points: timid/paranoid, blames herself needlessly, aimless

Autumn: impudent (in a good way), empathic, doesn't back down, polite, perceptive, excellent listener.  Very logical.  Very principled and has suffered to help others and will do so in the future.  Just loves learning, some gaming, music and has a bit of a social life.  Everyone seems impressed by her competence.  She slightly resents people's urges to protect her since she wants to be on the front lines of any fight :)  bad points: impatient, blames herself needlessly, somewhat overconfident at times

Omega: very quiet.  very organized, precise mind.  Very self confident, yet humble.  Dry, dark sense of humor.  Fierce passion for his music, he's been in a band he's learning to be a professional DJ.  Very honor bound and dutiful.  Extremely impatient with stupidity and bad character.  Bad points: brooding, intimidating, blames himself needlessly (but quietly)

Flair (my teacher): there's not a good word for most of her traits :)  she's outgoing and energetic and very amiable, but she shifts to unyielding and confrontational in a heartbeat if she thinks it will accomplish anything worthwhile.  Deeply cares about healing and helping, but is definitely no one's servant and has healthy self esteem.  Absolutely, unyielding and passionate about her mission in life and upholding her values.  a warrior in the best sense of the term.  Bad points: angry, impatient, impulsive, blames herself needlessly.

I suppose if I were going to describe me, just to be fair I'd say:
very analytical, perceptive, intuitive.  Empathic and sharing of what she has.  Unconcerned with convention.  Obsessive gamer.  Loves to teach.  Extremely dedicated to her vision of purpose and morality.  Able to understand different points of view though doesn't always remember she can do this.  Bad points (past): depressed, pedantic, apathetic, blames herself needlessly Bad points present: pedantic, impulsive, blames herself needlessly, complacent (at times)"

Lesson #1: I control my emotions.  My perceptions can make me oblivious to what I'm feeling but once I have my perceptions centered, I control what I'm feeling.  My feelings may drift away from that, but once I notice that drift, I can bring them back.

On Dec 21, 2009
Lesson #2: I am not my past.  I am not the sum of all the things that happened to me.  I am an independent being who has experienced those things.  They do not determine my state, only my knowledge.

These are not just words.  These are emotions and understanding I've felt working in my head.  Proof in deeds to follow.

I'll explain who these people are later but...
thanks Flair, Omega, Autumn and Jeliza.  For prepping me for this lesson and probably for even more."

"event","and that's a severe understatement.

Yesterday, was talking with my new friend Autumn, and my teacher, Flair.  Something came up in conversation where there was suddenly a lot of tension about some sort of threat in Autumn's life.  Flair turns to me soon after this becomes known and says ""Kendra, calm down"".  And I'm saying ""what? I'm not tense...?"" and I thought I was calm. I really did. Even did a sort of spot check on my emotions the second time she said this a little later.  She then said ""look, get up, go outside, do a meditation, you're too tense"".  And I was a bit puzzled but I trusted her judgment. (Plus there really wasn't tons that was relevant for me to say in the conversation at that point.)  But I got up and did that.

First step was to open the window and burn some sage.  And as I got back down off the bed from opening my window I realized I was shaking. Like, in serious adrenalin reaction. Not the worst I've had.  But enough that this wasn't a mild jolt.  Later, today, Flair said she knows the size of the gap in time between my text messages.  It only goes below  a certain level if I'm HUGELY agitated over something.  No one's ever noticed that before.  Or if they did, they were obtuse enough not to realize I might like to know that o_O  Flair let me know.  It's very nice to be understood."

"event","I've been kind of quiet about what's been going on in my life.  I'm not going to do anything but nod and say ""Things got worse....and then finally things got better.""  And I have a lot of people to thank explicitly for this, people whom I'll have to introduce the existence of to my friends and acquaintances.  So I won't recite a list of names without context.

Last night I got to have a !!! moment of proof I'm doing the right thing now.

Basically, I have a teacher now (at least that's the most prominent role she has with me. It's not romantic it's just....very strange.  Deep kinship, basically).  And she gave me my first formal assignment...except it sounded like she wanted me to research something impossible.  I was becoming very agitated.  I very much wanted to learn more than I ever had in my life.  How could she be doing this?  I must be misunderstanding the question.  So I kept asking over and over trying to get her full attention to clarify.   Because she seemed to think she wasn't asking anything exceptional.  

But here's the weird thing.  It was like I heard a voice of my own in my head.  Distant but clear a sort of flat intonation saying ""See, you knew this would happen, she'd hurt you after all, see...."" and on and on in that line.  And I have experienced that sort of voice before.  However, this ""hearing"" was usually only apparent in review of very recent memories. It's like the voice has a Someone Else's Problem field.  My mind perceives it and doesn't really have the option to react.  Except there was one HUGE difference.  First, I was more aware of the voice than almost any other time.  Like the Someone Else's Problem Field went down most of the way. 100 watts to 25.  But it gets stranger....

Because the voice had no emotional effect or affect.  Normally, the voice ALWAYS creates or spreads very negative emotions.  Perhaps weakly at first but gets stronger quickly.  Moreover, I felt a sort of mental-emotional muscle working which I recognized.  Part of me was trying to make the voice stronger.  Was trying to make me hurt myself.  This had it's own Someone Else's Problem field, and that one was at 50 watts.  I was still really ignoring both parts because I was so anxious to be answered.

But that's all I felt.  I did feel despair trying to get a hold in my mind, but it kept...mostly just sliding around unable to really get leverage.  And then my teacher explained I'd misunderstood the question.  And both SEP's dropped to zero and I went ""The f*ck you say.  Get GONE damn you!  See? YOU! you were wrong!  and YOU! go to SLEEP!""  That wasn't my literal reaction but that's the best verbal narrative.  And the two parts did as I bade them.  And I turned to my teacher and I explained what had just happened.  And that even with the people I loved the very best, whom I had trusted with my life, I had never been able to so thoroughly avoid a self destructive impulse.  Not even so much as avoid it: instinctively REPELLED the impulse.

I realized I felt safe.  And I started to cry but I purified my joy and I was very giddy and had to go meditate for a few minutes to calm down to functional levels :)"

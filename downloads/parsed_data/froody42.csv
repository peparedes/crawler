You observe it but rarely interfere. Because of your shy and timid nature you will not have so many friends in your life. But then again, large crowds aren't your thing anyway. You are comfortable on your own and are reserved to others who you don't know or know very little of. You know everyone out there does not want to be your friend, and knowing that is good. However, people who don't know you that well thinks that you are cold and distant since you don't want  to talk to them. Although you mean no harm, you can't always be perfectly understood in the world. No one can. Life in general are you quite serene with even if there are some things you don't like. Your love-life is not so full of boys/girls, but if you flirted more with the ones you were interested in I'm sure something would happen. The hobbies you choose are calmer ones, you are no party person that likes to drink and make-out with three or more guys/girls in one night. Reading a book or swimming is more your thing.<br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(0,0,0)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/PainfulBliss/quizzes/What+is+your+element%3F+%5Bwith+pics+%2B+detailed+answeres%5D"">quiz</a>!<br/>

"event","Section 1: How You Approach Life and How You Appear To Others
    You are always questioning and learning, and you seem young and alive no matter what your chronological age, for your mind is always alert, curious, flexible and open to new experiences. You have a childlike enthusiasm for anything new and you learn easily, but you also get bored rather quickly. You can be something of a scatterbrain, for you tend to have so many ideas and irons in the fire that it is hard to keep track of them all. You need and crave variety, change, mental stimulation, and an active social life. Find out more with your full-length reading...

 Section 2: The Inner You: Your Real Motivation
    You are a gambler and an adventurer at heart, one who loves to take risks, to discover and explore new worlds, and to take the untried path rather than the safe, reliable one. You are an independent soul, freedom-loving, and often very restless. You need a lifestyle that provides opportunities for travel, movement, change, and meeting new people. A steady routine which offers much in the way of security but little in the way of space and freedom is odious to you. Find out more with your full-length reading..."

i am so tierd. molly i love you, and thank you so much for the food. i ate it and it was Delicious:P i ended up going to work all week, i knew id just have to go through with it annyway, and so i just dragged myself through it. apologies for annoying everyone with my whineing. i just didnt know what to do and was unhappy. i miss you all, and it sucks that all i ever get to see you is on weekends, and i work on weekends. but i am of course working on changing things, i just dont like how not clear cut it can be sometimes. like, in order to change cirtan things i dont like i might have to change some things i do like, such as the people i work with, and having insurance and whatnot. it might be easyer if they where solid on putting me on to gos, they have been telling me how hard they have been trying for months now, and thats all that seems there is. who knows how long it will take and if they even care if it happens at all. they have tons of people they could find to do that job. (and i have wached a few trained after i asked)they need me in another position, why should they care to put me somwhere else and themselves in a pickle. i feel bad though, if they are indeed trying.

  i want to go to famous daves to make more money and work better hours.but i am afraid i wont like it, and if it is worth it. but how do you know unless you do it?? so there you go."

"event","i worked really fucking hard to get out of that shit hole before twelve. just for the idea of the thing. i was doing great. started cleaning my floor( which was fucking filthy.. )at like 11:15 or some crap like that. and for any one who dosnt know  thats awsome. we close at eleven on saturday. so how the fuck, do you ask, i actually end up walking out the door at 12:11? people just like being crappy and fucking selfish i guess. a lot of the usuall stuff i cant really remember, because that junk just happens all the time. Brian the busser is a douchebag. i got so mad at him i didnt know what to do with mysef. because he is a selfish bastard he got to leave with the line ( which i was practically done at the same time as.. and besides all he has to clean is the lane and that is about as big as my closet. the alley is as big as about three of my kitchens and i clean it every time i work.  )so cutting to the point here, i was done before him. i worked harder, i think, to get my closing duties done. i was done, all accept for the floor in back of the coolers. should take me two seconds litterally to sweep the water from behind there into the nearby drain. i was pushing the coolers out of the way when he runs back to take the very device i need for this task. my squeegee.(sp???) so he asks while grabbing it, "" can i borrow this for five munutes?? i swear it'll take me five minutes""i reply "" no im right about to use it just now, it'll take me less than five...."" he walks away from me with it. so i yell after him: "" NO, I SAID NO!!! YOURE SUCKH JERK!!! IM USING THAT!!! DO YOU KNOW WHAT NO MEANS??"" he ignores me 
all accept for repeating "" ill bring it to you when im done."" so i eventually find one that the line gets done with and start using it instead. and when the idiot comes back im already done and he is being cheaked out. thanks a lot. what a fucking jerk?? your not the only one who wants to leave asap today. and because you are so damn selfish my work is for nothing. he got to leave when the line did. and i had to wait in the lobby for about a half hour after the manager checked me out untill to gos or the bar or dish was done so i could leave. it ended up being the to go person jo jo that i left with.i was infuryated. i HATE being ignored or disrespected. i dont belive i do anything to earn disrespect. i give it to anyone else, just basic respect as a person, is a big thing with me. i cant imagine me doing that to anyone else. not even someone i feel might have earned it. i was just so mad and i had nobody or no way of letting it out.  

 and then lilly calls me. i wanted to teller what a crappy person brian was  and how i was just waling through the door. but then i cant even differentiate her voice from the fifty down at osu all having fun on  the first new years right after i turn 21. it must be a trend with me or somthing. so what did you do on your sweet sixteen?? i worked. what did you for prom? i worked. what did you do for summer vacation? i worked. practically since i was in sixth grade. 21st birthday i was supposed to work, but i called off. that was pretty cool though. it makes me so mad. i was fine all day at work sept for the last maybe half hour. and it ruined my night.stupid crap. i wanted to talk to lilly. i told her to go somwhere quieter. the  phone just gets passed from person to person screaming HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!  and telling me they love me. i love them too. and i am glad to hear from them, because they thought of me. but it just makes me sad. that i cant be there with them. and so i waited. because if i hung up everyone would be like, whats her deal. and i am not mad at THEM. but nobody was saying anything. i just hear party and it makes me want to cry. so i say im gonna take a shower. no reply, just party. so i hung up. and took a shower, and here i am.. alone in front of the computer whining about my dumb job. i was so mad i didnt know what to do.there was no one to be mad at. so why was i so flipping mad?? i just dont want to make salads for the rest of my life. or even now. i hate food and the people who come out and buy it annoy me. so how could i make that shit my life. and yes fourty hours a week makes that feel like your life. but im not mad anymore. just hungry. and  wanting to be with my buds on new years eve. instead of what seems like perpetuating the loserdome i seem to have created for myself,  or fallen into, what have you."

  i think getting a new job would make me much happier. i want to go to school. but i really dont want to. i forget how stupid everyone is there. im glad ant understands that, i dont think many do, or ever can, thier heads are on such a different place. its kind of furstrating. but then, nobody but a few can compleatly grasp the total meaning of anything from one person. words get used instead of feelings. i dont feel alone. i hated high school, but i loved it.there are good things hidden in stupid crap. like i guess there is everywhere.

first day off since..hmmm last friday. but more next week i think. at least two. thats nice. but how will my paycheak be?? fine im sure. (getting greedy am i??)
im sposed to go pick up my matty from my dads later today. i do miss him. crazy that kids got a job already. i feel old,haha. 
 one thing that does suck is that ive never cared so much about money as i do now it seems. which i guess would make sence, taking into account im not livin in my mammas house anymore. 
i still wanna go to art school :).
ugh. i also lost my phone.cant find it anywhere. i hate losing shit. that is a good source of annoyance even if i get approved by sprint to get a new one, i gotta pay a fifty dollar deductable. and i still gotta apply for health insurance and whatnot from og, sounds like fun. what a racket that whole thing is. it would be easyer if my employers learned html, since they say we now HAVE to do it online.molly, when is it your opening this bookstore of yours?? hehe sorry, take your time love ;). 

my cats are crazy. i think im off to the store now to provide for them."

   sorry i cant post regularly. on wednesday we saw mc chris in bg.it was cool to see all the other dorks, i felt not alone :), got two complements on my gryffindor jacket, and mc chris signed it. i really appreaciate that.especially because of all the dweebs it seemed trying to take advantage of his sighning stuff. sorta made you sad. like that dave matthews song, if u get my meaning. ""play more, ten times in the same day,"".hes a person, and people need to remember that. had a real cool time with lil,lea,chris and his buddy billy. ah, and who could forget my libby. thanks for commin guys.i needed somthn like that to cheer me up.its nice to go out and do some stuff.. and to have the buds i do. u guys make me happy. yay for working all next week!!!me n u lil.:) corse lea too..sept not at the og. 



 ah more to post. apologies, stop reading when u feel the need:) so today i put in my two weeks at the moveies. i shall miss that place. it is a cool job for high school kids, but three years for me is just enough, and i make no real money there. and this right after a review, hah. but speeking of high school,i had the Pleasure of seeing someone who shall not be named, due to my restraint of anger tward them. i feel i should be decent, if only to be better than said person and friend. they came to the movies on presumably ""fall break"" since i havent seen this person in quite a while.it probobly should not have upeset me so, but being behind the consession orderd arround like that, without a doubt did not make me feel.. good. snide remarks and facial expressions are not needed from you. i know where i work. i know where i am. and what dissapoints me is that you will probly never know anything of this, or for that matter anything other than your own lot in life, and not even care to discover anything else.  

but i take that back. i dont mean to be mean. you probly dont even know what you did, its just where you are right now."

        but hey, in other news of my crazy adventures, i was just sitting here bout a half hour ago on this computer, when suddenly i hear a "" screeeeeeeeeeeeccch bang!"". and you know what that means, car accident! so just like dane cook said, all the neigbors are slowly emerging from thier dwellings to veiw the wreckage and hopefully find new gossip for thier pals(oh the irony).just thought it was funny. so i didnt go out,just for this reason, and when im in an accident i think i would want people to mind thier own damn business.. its kind of embarassing. but this did not prevent me from discovering the true happenings out on the street below. upon entering my bedroom upstairs i discover a clear view of the street outside our house, and a shiney red pickup whith its front end entwined with a street light, compleatly in the grass on the side of the road, like it was drivin on the sidewalk or somethin. thought that was odd. well, thats all for now, as i am hungry and need socks."

"event","so right now im trying to persuade myself that calling off today was the right thing to do. I feel so bad that someone else has to pick up my slack, and if it ends up being lilly that would be awful. I just told myself that she can just say no when they ask her to close the ally, (somthing i get stuck doing every single day i'm there and it's a bitch) but now on second thought they might just make her feel bad and pressure her into it because they know if they work her down its likely she will just do it. why does no one want to to that job? its so stupid, they just pile all the shit jobs onto one super shit job and just leave it to one person to do. what happens if that person cant one time? they are just sqrewed all night because nobody will want to to that once theve been used to somthing else. its like out of the blue to them, ""why should I do that?"". I know its my fault. I said i'd do the stupid job, but I believe some revisions to the job description are in order. or maybe I should just stop being a litte bitch and get crap done. but i dont think a stupid job should make somenone feel so depressed and worthless. if everyone just did one little part of the ally( because im not the one who was even using it and messing it all up,that would be the servers. and believe me it gets pretty messy.)just one little part, would take em only 15, 20 ,min.whereas when left to one(me)it takes about three hours. and I think I make good time. then all this shit wouldnt be piled on one person's 8 hour shift everyday. just after a few months it gets a bit old. but enough bitching. just had to get that out. maybe if i am unsatisfied with somthing i should fix it. i just wonder if I can. or if this is all I am good for."

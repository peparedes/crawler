Can I just say that I hate my family right now and that my dad makes me <b>so</b> angry. He's talking about not letting me go to Central. Which really pisses me off because Greensboro is NOT where I want to be at all. It <i>NEVER</I> has been. And I could be with all of the credits I deserve and took and happy in my place if my parents hadn't harassed me to leave Hartford and told me they wouldn't pay for my schooling. Now he wants me to not go to Central because ""he cant afford it."" I didn't ask him to fucking go to Ghana for two months <i>knowing</i> he wouldn't get paid. And if he had fucking been paying my credit card <b>THAT HE HAS BEEN USING</b> then I would be able to take out a fucking loan to cover the difference of my finacial aid. But he has not been paying my credit card and has FUCKED UP my credit. I got the credit card and left it at home so that I wouldn't use it and this man maxed it out and didn't bother to pay for it. WHAT THE FUCK IS HIS PROBLEM!!! So he's fucked up my credit and left up to him I'll be unhappy and angry living miserably in this god forsaken piece of shit southern fucking shithole town called Raleigh like <i>him</i>. And that makes me angry because Terance GOT TO CHOOSE where he wanted to go to school and also got to stay where he started. I don't GIVE A SHIT if it is in-state. Because we were living in MA when he got in. And the ONLY reason I said I didin't care if we moved to this POS place is because they kept harassing me AT THE WORST times when I was fucking depressed asking me if we could move. Not only was I sick of them bothering me but I was ready to say anything to get them the hell out of my face. And I've experienced VERY FEW good things in this place AND I HATE IT. I want to be elsewhere. Where I can be happy and make friends who aren't fake who GET me and stay there and be stable and have stable relationships. But I <b>didn't</b> <i>get</i> to choose where I went to school, because my first choice school was in Canada. He told me I can't leave the country. I didn't get into my next choice school. And the school that I finally <i>chose</i> to go to, a school that I liked, a school I had friends at, a school I did well in, a school WHERE I LEARNED <i>SOMETHING</i> I was forced out of because of my asshole dad. And forced to go to that PIECE OF SHIT SCHOOL which will probably be the reason I don't get into medical school. This is just ridiculous. <b>WHY THE HELL CAN'T <i>I</i> GO WHERE THE FUCK <i>I</i> WANT TO GO, HUH!?!?!?</b> I wish I could say this shit to my dad because there's some other bullshit I would like to bitch at him about, but I won't say it here because someone might <i>hack</i> their way into my online diary and read it when they have no business reading it and then go and tell my brother that I <i>""Have stuff about my life on the internet""</i> Even though it is <b>NO BUSINESS OF ANYONE'S <I>WHAT</> THE HELL I PUT ON THE INTERNET!"

I know why I'm mad... I'm mad at him for making me do it, because I had just like 10 minutes before had the conversation with him about how I didn't want to have sex with him and why that is. So yea, after having that conversation with him I <i>am</i> mad at him for that much. Also, as bad as this sounds and as much as I hate to admit it; I actually kind of liked it. Granted, if it didn't take place the way it did it would've been better... But I don't like that it was like <i>'enjoyable'</i>. So I'm mad at myself for that, because I didn't want to like it, then I could've been mad about that too, that he like wasn't 'gentle' or something...but he was... kind of... excluding the times I tried to get up and he pulled be back. He didn't like hit me or pick me up and toss me (which has happened as hard as that is to believe). Even so, I'm still mad at him for it; I'm glad he didn't like hurt me physically but that kind of thing hurts on the inside and will in my case manifest itself into physical pain because that's how things are for me... anyways... 

I walked away for like an hour and now I don't know what I really wanted to say other than that I'm mad for two reasons...

What is wrong with me that I manage to get myself into shitty situations??? It's gotta be me, cuz this is not the first time some bullshit like this has happened with me and sex and someone I don't want to do it with... I liked Dante until last night. Not liked a lot; but I liked him enough to want to get to know him. I'm really just mad at myself, I guess cuz I wonder if I can actually hold it against him for wanting to hook up with me when he was drunk as hell and I <i>had</i> made out with him at my apartment before we went to the party... But I was curious and kisses don't really mean that I have to have sex with someone. I don't know why I'm mad. I mean, I know I have reason to <i>be</i> mad; I just haven't had enough time to think about it to really figure out why I'm mad, because I feel inclined to blame myself for this one- that maybe I sent him mixed signals or something. But I wasn't like shaking my ass in his face or anything. He had been to my apartment he's seen my room he saw Theo's toothbrush in my toothbrush holder; he said ""Aww look at you and your boyfriend's toothbrush sittin there,"" <b> HE SAID <i>THAT</i></b>!!! Granted, Theo isn't my boyfriend, but he saw the toothbrush and he jumped to the conclusion that I had a boyfriend and I didn't say anything to make him believe different (but I did <i>do</i> differently... the kisses) Maybe I'm mad at myself for not following him in my own car to that party last night- not that I was sober enough to drive at 6am this morning- SO I would've had to take a cab back anyway. But the walk to Walgreens to meet the cab that I called <i>did</i> bring new meaning to the phrase ""walk of shame"" for me; that is while morning traffic was just picking up I felt like I was being stared at; oh wait, I <i>was</i> being stared at, cuz there was no side walk so I was walking on the side of the road looking like a prostitute or a runaway highschool kid or something... I don't know exactly what I looked at but I know I looked bad, 'specially since I had cried all my makeup off.yyyeaaaa..... 

I made Lauren feel bad about not coming to get me. I didn't mean to. I just didn't think to take a cab until I had walked a good 1/2 mile in my heals and saw Bluebird cab drive by... heh... I texted her like 19 times while I was still there, and I called her and she didnt answer and i called her house phone to wake her up even though I couldn't speak to her. I just needed her to wake up and read my texts. All of the text messages I sent her reached her phone around 8:15 when I was sitting in my living room nursing my feet, which walked over a mile <i>in heals</i> that aren't that comfortable when I'm sitting down let alone walking up a ridiculously sized mountain- ok... medium sized hill- either way, i was wearing the wrong shoes for this walk. 

""Date rape"" that was the first thing Theo said after I told him the story. Then he grabbed my butt and he was like ""it's getting bigger... that's why all the guys want you."" And he asked me why I didn't call the cops and I was like ""because I've been to jail and I don't want to go again."" And he was like ""it was self defense."" But it was also self-defense last year when I hit Emily after she hit me in the face... Alright, it wasn't self-defense last year; that... that was pride. But it could've been considered self-defense. Either way I would've had to go to jail this morning and call my mom and tell her that she was gonna have to find at least 1000 bucks to get me out of jail. I say that cuz that's how much my bail was in Hartford. And Theo of all people should know that cops <i>always</i> and will always and forever make <b>everything</b> worse in any situation. Theo was like ""what does he look like?"" and I was like ""skinny, black, big lips lol."" And he's like ""he got money?"" and I was like ""I guess... he works at a bank america"" and hes like ""i'm a beat dat mutha fuckas ass and rob 'em"" lol... I think maybe he deserves the ass whoopin (I <i>did</i> say ""no""). 'specially since I told him about my 'incident' with the marine last year... Ex-airmen, Dante had to do the same...Not exactly the same cuz I can definitely say that I did not send <i>that</i> guy mixed signals, but I can't say that I didn't with Dante. Either way, he's a Fuckin' jerk...

Matt texted me to ask me ""how life is treating [me]"" lol I don't know, but I think he may have noticed my away messahge which stated  ""it's just me and my feet... no one is ever there when I <i>actually</i> need them."" I told him ""awful.""  He requested twice for me to talk to him about it and I was like ""nothin's wrong"" he asked me if I was lying and I said ""yes."" and he was like ""So talk to me"" and I was like ""I don't want to talk about it."" and he left his open invite for me to call him and talk to him (like usual)... *smiles* that Matt... He's a sweetheart. 

Anyway.... I'm gonna go to Lindell's little Shin dig at his new apartment... can't get raped by a gay guy... well, I could lol, but I don't think its likely...

What can I say?
I'm smiling when I'm with him 
I can't help but to frown when I'm without him 
Today a knock came at my door 
And I actually jumped knowing it was him... 
In my dreams...
I know he's with other women
But I think I know where his heart is
I know I can't have him fully
Yet I'm so happy 
Yet I feel good with him 
And like I'm not alone
Because he's there 
Until we part ways again 
And I'm alone 
And all I can think about is his well-being 
Is he ok?
Does he need me?
Does he care the way I do?
Maybe it's me
Maybe I care too much
Maybe the wanting hasn't left me 
Not like it should have
All I want is for him to be here
And all I wish is for the knocking to be him
Instead of my imagination
So my anxiety and this anticipation can retreat
So that maybe I can sleep in peace - 1:42am

I don't see what the problem is... Why doesn't god just take me now and get it over with???? All my money is gone.... WHERE IT WENT is a <i>Fucking MYSTER</i> to me, but whatever its gone. And I'm supposed to go see Dima in DE tomorrow... How does one do that with no money??? Oh, I'm the fuckin' retard who is going to make that happen. And for what?!?!?! So that I can see him and be happy for one more moment in time before I have to force myself to leave his side again. And choke back tears for 8 hours as I drive back here alone and heart broken. I don't know what my motive is. I really, honestly and truly don't know anymore why I bother or why I care or why I bother to care to give my heart to anybody <b>ever</b>

I talked to Kate the other day about whether I should go to see Dima and how I want to be over him so that maybe I can finally start to enjoy the company of other guys. She told me that she's <i>still</i> not over Terance and it's been 4 years! I don't want to pine over Dima for 4 years, nor do I want to be with anybody but him right now. Even though I am basically stringing along two guys right now. Well, really just one... cuz let's be honest Theo wouldn't care if he found out about Jeremy... So I ask myself again, why am I going to DE to see Dima? Partially because I'm sick of sitting around in Greensboro and so I can say I did <i>something</i> over spring break. And I guess I have this stupid naive idea that maybe, just <i>maybe</i> if I go up there to see him that I'll finally be able to convince him to move down here to be with me. But why bother? When I know the chance is so slim its invisible... Maybe because I know I'll hate myself if I let the opportunity to see him and look into his eyes and see how much he cares about me and if its worth my tears every night pass... because I know if I can't say that I tried and did everything I could to get him to come down here to be with me, then I wasted my time with him when I was <b>in</b> Hartford. I don't want to be able to say that.  Shower

That I'm not in control of myself. I want control. I want control over myself and my life and my feelings and I don't have it and I don't like it. 

Good eye, sniper 
Now I shoot, you run 
The words you scribbled on the walls 
The lots of friends you didn't have 
I'll call you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out? 
For them all to know the end of us all 

Bye bye beautiful 
Don't bother to write 
Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars 
Face step, let down. 
Face step, step down. 

Reggie keeps asking me to have sex with him. fuckin JERK... I told him sex complicates things. From the very beginning i told him that sex complicates things and that I don't want to do it. But he keeps asking. aaahh!!!! It makes me really mad. He doesnt listen. ""I just wanna punch [him] in the face... oh well, another time place."" I miss Dima... and i started to miss theo earlier today when we were at the mall shopping for reggie and i saw the shirt that he had that i put in the hawaiian punch bottle :-( i got sad and almost started to cry.

OH when the day is blue 
I'll sit here wondering about you
And how the pollen fell
All around your face in strange yellow patterns

But I wasn't prepared for this...noo
I wasn't prepared for this...


Come, come back to me my, my darling 
Come, come back to me my, my darling (beba)

I'm randomly quoting a song which means I need to go to bed... so I will."

I have the worst headache and I was wondering why and then I remembered it's cuz I cried earlier. Why did I cry earlier??? Because Dima's ring fell off my finger at Shelly's house and broke in half and as it did so my heart did the same. Yes, I cried over Dima's broken ring. He gave it to me and I said I'd never take it off and it broke IN HALF. I could like kill myself I feel so alone... I'm a failure. I can't even keep a ring on my hand how sad is that. I called him as soon as it happened... He was out somewhere. There was lots of noise in the background. He was like ""It's all good."" but its NOT. It is to him but it's not to me because it actually means something to me, because he gave it to me. He put the ring down on my lap and said it was made out of stone and I looked at it and said ""r u giving this to me?"" and he looked at me and said ""u want it?"" and I nodded and smiled the way I only do with him and put it on my thumb and he said ""u can keep it."" and he gave me matching lil stone too... and i broke the ring because I'm a failure who can't do anything right :-(

That ring is only the beginning... a sign that my life shall further crumble that I- no matter how hard I try to fight am a slave to that which I hate most about myself- my emotions; I'll always be a hopeless ball of emotions deprioritizing only to prioritize again, letting go only to grab hold again and running forward only to look back and watch the past suck me in. I <I>am</i> alone. That is the truth, that no matter how many people are in my company I'm only me and alone. I can't hide from that nor can I run from it. I can only accept it. And eventually give in. I CANT BELEIVE I BROKE HIS FUCKING RING!!!! I'm so upset. 

I'm a slave to a &hearts; that won't let go</font></body></html>"

<font face=""Arial narrow"" color=""41058"" size=""03""><b>I wrote a song. I think about Dima way too much... Here's my song:</b>

Last Night I had a dream
My world came crashing down upon me
And all I could do was watch 
And feel the tears fall down my face

I looked up to the sky
And asked God please take this pain away from me 
And all I could think is how he's given up on me 
It was then I knew that it would never end 

Chorus:
I once had my life together
I once had all my priorities straight
I once knew what I wanted 
Now all that has changed 

And now all that  I want
He's what I want 
That man I cannot have 

Last night I had a dream
I asked you if you were with her
When you answered these visions came over me

It's been 6 months and I still can't believe
Maybe we'll still get together
And thoughts of that spot in your bed
That used to belong to me 

Chorus:
I once had my life together
I once had all my priorities straight
I once knew what I wanted 
Now all that has changed 

And now all I want
He's what I want 
That man I cannot have 

Last night I had a dream
My world can crashing down upon me 
And when I woke I looked around
And realized it was not a dream

I just realized a minute it ago that I'm still not over Dima... and that I never fully got over Richard. I can't read my poem about Richard without starting to cry and I can't think about how happy I was with Dima without crying or at least starting to. 

It's sad really... My favorite picture of me and Dima together is the first one we ever took together on our second date to... I forgot the guy's name but he's a weird redhead... well it was to his b-day party... We went out to breakfast with him and some other guys on one of my last days in CT. And we listened to his band play... Well, Dima listened and I fell asleep on the couch because I was kind of bored. But even being bored I was just happy that I was there with him... <b>point:</b> Every time I look at that picture I start crying, so I put a different picture in my frame and hid that one on the backside of the pic I put in. That way, it's still framed but I don't have to look at it and think about how I went through Bradley airport with red eyes and in histerics crying over leaving my boyfriend, whom I just <i>knew</i> I'd never see again. Granted, I saw him again but he wasn't my boyfriend anymore and I knew it was going to happen. I knew it all along and tried to prepare myself, but I couldn't.

I don't think I'd get back together with Richard... I say this because of how I am and how I've called him 8 times in the past 2 weeks and he has answered only once and the one time he answered i dont think he meant to cuz he hung up on me lol... He says he's excited for me to come up and I believe him; he's just so weird about like socializing even if it's with me, which is bad. 

Dima says he's not comin' down here now. I thought he was  <b>::::::::</b> Shrugs <b>::::::::</b>      I wonder how life would've been if I lost my v-card to Dima. At least I'd have a happier relationship to remember. 

I was happy knowing I was with Richard, but he disappointed me on many occasions so it <i>wasn't</i> very happy... I remember the time I cheated on him, because he cancelled a date on me by not calling me or answering my calls... so basically he stood me up. He said he was working and that his phone died... Which I believed. It was just the fact that <i>he</i> didn't call <i>me</i>. I remembered I pushed my parents to go out that night to a jazz club so that I could have sex and go wherever he wanted to take me without having to explain anything to my parents. Yea, that didn't work out... I was so mad at him that I called Josh K. who left a party, came and hooked up with me and then left. It didn't make me feel as good as I thought it was going to lol 

Yea... <b>I hate being home alone because I start thinking about the past and getting all sad and crying...</b> I don't know if I'm friends with Jessica any more... She called me last night to apologize for saying some shit to me, but I was still asleep when I was on the phone so I don't know what she said to me really... She was like ""I'm not apologizing for what I said, I'm apologizing for how I said it."" and I kind of just grunted ""uh-huh."" So she said she'd let me go. That was at like 9pm... I've been up since then its 9:12am now... I guess I should stop avoiding her and have the conversation that we should have had back in October when I got mad at her in the first place... I guess I can call her now, since my day has already been ruined by my previous thoughts. Those thoughts will rule my day as they have so often done in the past at random times. 

Jen's pissed at me because I said some rude shit to her about Jon... I didn't mean to say it the way that I did. I actually didn't mean it the way that it came out. Well maybe I did a little... No... No I didn't mean it that way at all... I felt bad about it and I apologized to her like 2 1/2 minutes after I said it after she put up an away message saying ""this is the line don't cross it"" o0ops... Anyways... I'm gonna do something else...</font></body></html>"

I haven't been thinking very much lately. I'm just bored really. Finals came around and I shut my brain off before I could get myself organized. I don't like UNCG. At Hartford it was like finals gradually came after Thanksgiving, but here it's like I came back from thanksgiving and the next Monday I was taking finals... actually it wasn't <i>like</i> that, it's what actually happened. Oh well, what can ya do right? I have an F in bio, a D in Cognitive psych which means I have to take it over even though I was going to anyway because I didn't learn shit from the guy, I got a C in Film and a B in Clinical Psych yay me... I'm going to be a super senior. Now I have to replan my next five years. This shit sucks. Next semest, I have to bring my GPA up. Which won't be hard, I just have to focus. When I'm focused like I was last year I am unstoppable. It's ridiculous how well I did last year. I got 100s on essays. <i>No one</i> gets perfect scores on essays, but I did. And I did a few without the help of James. I've spoken to him like 3 times this semester. Med school will keep you busy... I miss him. eh... Anyway, I just felt like doing something... But I don't really have anything more to say...</font></body></html>"

I want a boyfriend... I'm tired of being alone and sexless... I'm sick of seeing other people excited about their relationships and not having one of my own to be excited about... I've exhausted the thought of me ending up alone forever, without children, without a family, without a person to share my dreams with... and that is my only complaint about my life now. 

I think I've become too focused on the future, but I feel like I'm too old not to be. Granted, last year I had this conversation with Tewauna that I'm young and I want to have fun and that I wanted a boyfriend but that I wasn't going to start considering marriage right away because I had just turned 18 and had and have yet to be in a relationship for longer than 6 months... 3 months really... Because let's talk about it: 
Richard and I started in i think like March or april and I'm more inclined to say april even though I vaguely remember snow being on the ground the morning I went into school and told Lia about my first time, but anyway... yea we'll call it March... I didn't see him again until August the night before I was moving away and he only came then to say goodbye and every date we made between those dates was cancelled by him because he was working or something or blah blah blah... maybe that's y he says I will take much to get what I want... yea i def. wouldn't put up with that now, and every guy I meet for the rest of my life can thank him for that...
After him there was Doug C. who died, which isnt very chill but yea he and i were at the like 3 week point or something... 
Then there was Will who shouldn't really count because it wasn't a real relationship but for 4 months I had a title... I may have seen him once or twice a month for that 4 month period if I was lucky... oh yea and when I did see him he was all about the sex; lucky for him he was so much about the sex enough that I'd purposely try to annoy him by declining... 
so yea then there was Mike 2 weeks... then mike again like a week and a half and 
then julian like 5 months 'cept like we were together a week before i left for college and I hooked up with other guys so it really doesn't count... then mike again which is this time around and I'm just not gonna bother breaking up with him again cuz he just doesnt get it. 
Then Dima... first <i>real</i> like <i>actual</i> relationship from the end of February till July so like 5 months, 'cept like almost 2 of those months I was here. So that's like 3 months.  aaaaaannnndd <b>my point was....:</b> oh yea... I was in no place last year to be all about getting married and having kids right away like she is, but I do worry about my time passing and never finding the right person until it's too late to have kids and stuff. And before Dima I hadn't been in a real, healthy relationship where I felt comfortable enough to open up and say what's on my mind and stuff.. I mean kind of with Julian but our relationship by no means was healthy, because he begged me to go out with him. And the only reason I accepted was because he said that I could cheat on him if I wanted to as he was begging and he probably regretted that later. But anyways... 4 relationships with titles in the last 4 years and at this point I'm sick of waiting around; I'm sick of wasting my time with worthless guys; I'm sick of thinking that maybe my worst nightmare is going to come true as God's way of further smiting me. but yea... that's my complaint. My only wish is to succeed and to have someone to share my successes with.

Hate to be a lil' emo bitch, but this whole Matt dating a Chi Omega shit is really bothering me. Why? I dunno... I can be honest I don't know him that well, but a crush is a crush and I can't help it. I actually wouldn't have any kind of a problem with him dating a sorority girl if she were an AKA or a Delt or a Zeta or whatever, but a <i>Chi O-fuckin-mega</i>... It's kind of a slap in the face cuz if I'm not mistaken he and I had a long ass conversation about why I didn't join a black sorority, yet he goes out to date a girl in a white one... hmmm... And we could say that I'm jealous, but I had already gotten over the fact that he wanted to ""keep it friendly."" It just bothers me of his choice, a ""chi-o girl."" Not to mention, he's on her facebook pic from when they went to the Crimson and Creme dance or whatever... Which I actually wanted to go to... kind of... ok so I didn't want to go, but I would have gone if I had been asked... And the other day was her birthday and the fact that the facebook friend pics rotate shes on the front page of my profile today... I just can't stop seeing her. And I saw her yesterday when I was goin to luminaries with Teresa. I fuckin' walked right by her and if I had known at the time what I found out later last night I wouldn't have smiled at her. In fact, I probably would have given her the worst look in THE WORLD. So I guess it's better that I didn't know at the time. And ok I never liked Chi Omega... so I never really had a <b> real significant</b> reason to dislike the Chi Omegas; o0o0o0o0o but now I do. Ok and it's not like she purposely was like my friend and knew I liked him and went and started dating him plus I'm not the kind of bitch who'd go cause problems in a relationships because I'm jealous or whatever because I 1) have way to much pride to do that 2) don't really want him anymore 3) I have way to much pride to do that cuz he doesn't like me. But it's not him not liking me that bothers me and its not him having a girlfriend that bothers me cuz he told me he was talkin' to someone its the fact that of all the girls on this campus of all the friggin sorority girls it <b>HAD</b> to be a FUCKING CHI OMEGA. Its the fact that she's a chi omega that bothers me. If she had been an AD pi I'd probably feel the same. With all the white sororities I'd feel the same unless it was one of <i>my</i> sisters.

Ok. I'm pissed again lol... This stupid bitch on poets.com got mad at me for actually scrutinizing her poem and giving her advice when SHE ASKED ME FOR HELP, because she thought I offended her. I send her a message back and I was like ""i actually spent time trying to help you because you asked me and I could have just said ""the flow is off,"" but to me a review like that is not helpful."" Like she got mad and said that I basically told her that she's a bad writer and to be honest her poem was SHITTY there were A LOT of errors. And one of her reviews actually did say ""the flow is off and some places."" THATS IT. I like to point out to people where the flow is off if i think so, otherwise you're wasting your time and theirs because obviously they didnt think the flow was wrong when they posted it. But this particular woman actually sent me an e-mail before saying ""iom trying to make edits to this poem will u review it blah blah blah."" And I thought wow she actually wants a real review out of me; no, she just wanted me to say ""it's fine."" And she had the nerve to call me ignorant. IM SORRY but when I get reviews that say ""your flow is off"" I don't bother to go back and look at my poem 1) because I don't have issues with flow so if someone says that to me I'd know they were saying it because I said it to them 2)if the flow is off I'm not going to notice where you think it's off because I WROTE IT that's the point of the site (to encourage new writers to write and to help them get better). I'm sorry but you don't get better at ANYTHING with ""thats good."" You get better with constructive criticism and if you cant take that criticism then you don't need to put your poetry on a site like poets.com. You need to put it in your livejournal or xanga so that your friends can tell you it's good because they don't want to hurt your feelings. 

And this other person not sure if its male or female but ill say male. <i>HE</i> got mad at because he attempted to write a limerick and did the syllables and rythmn wrong; so in my review, I told him that the syllables and rythmn are off and pointed out where they are off and <b>WHY</b> they are wrong. He had the nerve to tell me there are no rules on syllables in a limerick and that if there is a rule to show him the site. So... And I know he's gonna get mad about this... I went on google read the first 5 sites and copy and pasted the link of each one in the e-mail saying ""proof: 1) link 2) link 3) link 4) link 5) link    Thank you for your time."" 

I'd get mad if someone proved me wrong like that, but anyways... lol I was just a lil annoyed that people can't take criticsm. Yes, my poetry is very important to me and it speaks of A LOT of my feelings, but I can take criticsm on it if it deals with structure of it or like the diction. There's a difference if you come to me and say ""your poem sucks because its about love."" THATS when you get offended; THATS when you get mad, but ""maybe you should change the words in line 4 of stanza 5 because it throws the flow off maybe you can try this 'blah blah blah'"" THAT IS HELPFUL and i don't understand why that woman got so mad about it. Granted; I had atleast one something to say about at least one something in every stanza, BUT it wasn't I who said that the poem was bad it was she. And if I made her feel that it was bad ok sorry, but you asked me to review it to help you which means you need to be able to put your feelings that are in the words aside and take the criticism for what the poem actually is not what its about. I didn't say anything about what the poem is about. When you ask someone to review your poem to help you then you need to be able to take it because it will make you and your poem better. </font></body></html>"

So I talked to Richard online a few hours ago lol... I've got to say it was probably one of the strangest conversations I've ever had with him. But I've gotta say I <i>am</i> 'bout sick of him telling me that I'm immature and could not possibly understand him. I HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT... If you don't think I'm on your level why would you talk to me? lol... That's what gets me... But yea, he claims he's a sociopath. I can't say I don't believe him I just think it's weird the way he brought it up, because all I said was that he needs to start calling me so that we can talk. He said there's nothing to talk about and I said that that's a problem. Not having anything to say to me shows that there's no relationship obviously right now there isn't. I'm not expecting him to call me and have an hour long conversation, but I did tell him that we need to try to develop a relationship and we can only do that by talking. And that's when he went off on a tangeant about how he's a sociopath and doesn't feel things the same way I feel things. And he proceeding to call me immature, tell me not to judge him which he did to me and some shit about how he wants nothing from me and he can go on knowing me or without knowing me and it wouldnt bother him... and he was like he likes me but I'm impleasant and there are other people he'd rather talk to lol... And he got off without saying bye which really chapped my hide btw... oh yea AND he told me that I don't think highly of myself because I take a lot in order to get what I want. And well... where I'm from, you need to sacrifice for things you really want. Yes I take a lot of crap, but I have to take shit to get what I want if it's important to me I'll do it. But yea when he came to that last argument of him I had to pause for like a minute and I thought ""oh no... thats true"" lol... but obviously I don't need him to tell me what I think of myself because I know what I think of myself, but I did think it was a good argument. 'Cept I told him that if I didn't think highly of myself I wouldn't have goals because I wouldn't care enough to set them for myself and he was like ""i guess."" I don't know. Of all of the stupid arguments we get into I've got to say that this one was actually funny to me, which is mean to say cuz he did start to kind of almost open up to me about the whole being a sociopath thing. The problem is that we were on two completely different pages in different books lol... Like I was seriously just talking about him calling me every once in a while so that we're not weird with each other and he went off about being a sociopath... and it really got started when i was like ""when u hang out with ur friends u have long conversations u may or may not be a phone person but your phone conversations should be like ur in person"" <--im taking back those quotes because thats not exactly what i said...but anyway he was like ""what friends"" so i was like ""i know u have friends"" and he was like ""i may talk to them once a week but we dont hang out"" he said he didnt have time and stuff... and i was like ""you dont have time to get together with friends?"" and he said no and proceeded that he has a few ex's that he calls every once in a while obvious assumption: he calls them to have sex...i asked if he doesnt have time for friends how does he have time to date... he said ""I DONT DATE."" So i asked him how he meets women because he had to have time to have sex with those 80 women he told me about and he corrected me and said 50... Which is still a ridiculous number and he accused me of having had sex with more people than him and i said ""definitely not."" I thought: ""nice try though."" lol So he gave up on that one... And it's stupid how we even got to that conversation, because whole point was that we need to communicate more lol... But he's so weird... I think that's my problem: I'm attracted to weirdos... They just aren't the guy for me unless they r weird as shit or have a major something wrong with them (mr. perfect)...

But yea... I thought about me and Josh's rel. which is why I decided to write lol... So I'm thinking that tonight's argument was, in fact a sign that I need to work on a piece of my personality and that is that I do manage to start stupid fights about nothing with guys... The problem is that I never mean to... ok... sometimes I do, but never with Richard. With Josh I do admit that sometimes I'd start arguments with him just because I knew that I knew how to push his buttons just right and that I could and he would let me and he would indulge me for a good 2 hours until he got sick of arguing with me. But Richard... I don't purposely start arguments with him... like last time it was like 4am and i got mad at him that he didnt want to read my poem about him... and all he could say was that he was tired and just wanted to have an easy conversation with me and i wouldnt let that take place because he obviously didnt care about my feelings if he was gonna blow off my poem that way or at least that's what i was thinking. And I can admit now that I started that one I couldve just let it go, but I'm so attached to my poetry that that was kind of insulting for me... But I guess it makes sense; at 4am I don't want to listen to other people bitch about their life and their love and shit, but of course I don't mind doing the bitching <b>:-)</b> heh. But tonight I really didn't mean to. I bring up telephone conversation he says hes a sociopath OH YEA and has the nerve to tell me that I don't understand my psychology... or the concept of sociopathy that his personality disorder is not chemical and it is therefore incurable... I asked him if the sociopath was a self-diagnosis and come to think of it he didnt answer that but anyway... he was like ""youre not a pyshcmajor even so your understanding of the subject is hazy."" Which sounds almost like shit that Jessica said that made me not want to speak to her anymore... hmm... But yea so he says because hes a sociopath and he creates his feelings that to him everyone else is weak and fragile... and well last time I checked THATS NORMAL... I'm not sure if I told him that his disorder not being chemical meant he needed to work on his personality lol but I definitely thought it... And we <i>did</i> learn in psych last year that a person can cure themself of their non-chemical personality disorder by changing aspects of their personality, but in Richard's defense we were also told that most people aren't just going to change their personality because someone tells them they should that it's like secondary motivation as is money and sex...So basically we were told that the only way a person can change thier personality is if they want to and Richard clearly doesnt want to lol... I don't want him to either but I <b>DO</b> want him to stop pulling the age card out cuz I will only put up with that bullshit for so long. Yes, I may do some immature things but I'm not slow or anything I understand everything once it's been explained to me but he acts like I'm slow and I can't keep up with him and that pisses me off, because I'm a very intelligent woman. My thing is that if you don't want to talk about something fully that is that when someone asks you a question about it you don't want to answer then don't bring it up and that's common sense because once you've begun to talk about it and you decide to withdraw you're going to get more and more questions. Anyways its 6am I'm goin to bed... </font></body></html>"

<marquee>Lookin back in November</marquee>

I talked to Josh K. online today. It was a pretty long conversation for us recently. He tried to convince me to move to Vegas with him. I was like 'ur retarded if u think i'm gonna follow u around the united states.' It was amusing though we talked about a bunch of junk... School, love... about that love shit though, I realize that it has never really been about me not liking me. Well, not recently. I love myself. I like myself the way I am and if other people don't oh well. But I've been so much better about seeing the good and people and not disliking people I've barely exchanged two words with. I just feel empty right now. Yes, the grades upset me but they aren't the reason I feel the way I do. And as much as I'd like to say its not cuz I don't have a guy; it is. And I can't say that I'm unhappy with my life. I like it. My life is fine and I am happy... for everyone else and all the exciting things that are happening for them. And I'm sorry if I sound selfish... but what the fuck about me?!? I gotta say I've been patient. I've waited for something so exciting as to change the dynamic of my so very disgustingly boring life and it has yet to come along and sweep me off of my feet. I gotta say this year more bad things have happened to me than good... In less than a year I've managed to get my first speeding ticket, become witness to he corrupt institution that is our Safety net (the police), run out of money, transfer into an awful school, GAIN 15 FUCKING POUNDS (wanna kill myself... not really), get all of the stuff I bought when I went shopping stolen ON MY BIRTHDAY, get a boyfriend and be forced to 'mutually' break up with him. And all the good stuff that has happened was with him. I don't know why I'm really so bothered by it though. That's the story of my life right?? The matchmaker who cannot find her own that will last; the quiet girl who is too busy judging the world while trying to make the best of it; the girl people love to her face and hate when shes not looking; the lady all the guys could see themselves in bed with but not together with. That's me. No, the world's not out to get me; God's testing me. I wish He wouldn't.

Anyway. It's still light outside... thats a first write an entry at 5:30 in the evening. Semi-formal is tonite. I'm not going... I was going to. I was never really excited about it though, but I asked Matt Flamer to go with me and he said he'd check the date cuz there was a concert he wanted to go to...Kanye West. And it is tonight. He's part of the reason I decided not to go cuz i didnt wanna go alone... But also cuz... ok so he was my only reason for not going. I told him that I like him the other day. Haven't really spoken to him since. Needless to say; I don't think he feels the same way lol... Which I'm fine with, but I'd still like to be able to talk to him. 

I saw Theo walking down the street yesterday when I was driving to campus from my job at the church nursery. I just immediately got sad. I knew it was him before I even passed. That walk and his head. I thought ""Is that Theo?"" and it was. I don't know why it makes me sad to even think about him... I don't know. I actually liked him i guess. I could supress that for a while, but I guess I just need to admit that I liked him. And I let him go for Jessica whom I never even talk to anymore cuz I'm mad at her for making me make that decision. I'd NEVER do that to her. NEVER. I mean she said shit about him being a bumb and using me for a place to stay... And ok fine I'll admit; no, he didn't have a place to live... But he wasn't staying on the street before he met me, so he obvisouly had somewhere to stay whether it was his own place or not. That didn't bother me. No, he doesn't have his own car, but I had stopped driving him everywhere after like the first 2 weeks of seeing him. I liked him. And I guess I still do, but it's like, with him, everything was so much more real. Like this is the world and I can sink or swim and as weird as it sounds I liked that. I liked being with him and knowing whether he said so or not that I was his girl and he was my guy. Even though it wasn't official. I know that he knew I wouldn't talk to him anymore if he did stuff with another girl. And for that whole two months when we were together I didn't <i>want</i> to find a guy to be with. I was satisfied with where I was with him. I could go to the club and I could go to parties without him and come back and get in the bed with him and feel good when he held me. And vice versa. When he went to clubs and shit and came back to get in my bed with me I felt like I could trust him and that he hadn't been with another girl and then came here to hop in my bed and go to sleep partially cuz we usually ended up doing something when he got back anyway but still... Being with him made me feel good and real. Like I'm not living in someone elses dream cuz something good finally happened to me. I felt like he needed me; not for a place to lay his head, or a vagina to stick his cock into, or anything like that. Just like I was the evaporated milk to his tea or the sugar to his kool aid. I don't really feel like I had to get him out of my life. I just wanted him not 'living with me.' But I think I might have gotten him fired from his job :-(
I miss him. It's been like a month now. Exactly a month actually. Anyway i'm gonna lay down for a couple hours til I go hang out with Terance.

<center>You make me
Do such krazy things
You make me 
love you 
And you make me feel
Shamless
You take away 
my pain
You take away 
my regret
And you make me feel 
like a dream

There is nothin' else
Don't want to let go 
And I don't think I can 
You're all that I've got
And sometimes it hurts
At times it sucks
And sometimes its nice
At times I want to hate you
But you're all that I've got
Sometimes I'm disappointed
At times I could kiss you
But cannot
Sometimes I wish for you 
Sometiems I dream 
At times I fall asleep alone

You are
Everything I aspire to be
And sometimes
You make me krazy
Because you're everything I need
You are
The only love I've known
And sometimes 
I wish you were not 
And I always 
hate depending on you

Sometimes I call 
Sometimes you answer
Sometimes I call 
Most times you're not there 
Sometimes
I forget
Sometimes 
I remember
Sometimes 
I'm on one knee
Most times 
I say screw you

I squeeze...
Listen to that CD
All the way through
And I think of you 
Want nothing 
But to Be with you

Sometimes I want
Sometimes I need
Other times I depend 
And others it's me

Sometimes my heart bleeds
At times it pumps blood
Sometimes it beats
And I breath
I squeeze
That space you've penetrated it 
And you're the only...
Sometimes I want to...
Sometimes I want you
At times I'm weird 
Sometimes you're special
At times I want 
And I squeeze

Sometimes I write
And dot the i's with hearts
Cross them out
Sometimes they see through me 
Sometimes I'm transparent
And at times I remember 
Sometimes I talk to him 
He who gave me the confidence 
You've taken away
He who saw the body
Before you took control
He who created it 
Before it was created
Before you were there
Before you liked it
Before he liked it
I talk to him

Where I float
I feel free
I feel you 
Surrounding me
And I weaken
And you take the strength
That I've created
You take my lonliness
You make me feel wanted 
Special
And love
But I'm incapable
Because you take 
my humanity
You take 
my emotions
You make me a follower

I'm not me with you 
You're not you with me 
And we're not ourselves
I take a piece of you
You take the rest of me
I'd give myself to you 
If you'd ask 
I'd love 
But I'm incapable 
I'm afraid of it 
I can't commit to it
I can't commit to you 
You can't to me
And we're different

I close my eyes
The t.v.'s on
August 2002
I'm with you
I'm kissing you
And hugging you
I'm holding you 
Your hand in mine
I could cry
A tear to my eye 
I could cry

You're around somtimes 
I remember 
August 2002
The darkness 
our breathing
My feelings 
And I depend 
on you
tell me what to do 
decide my plans 
treat me like a hobby
3 months
9 months
12 months 
it's here
The anniversary
The rotting v-day chocolate
Memories
Of all that I need 
And you 

Sometimes
You're here with me
If I could realize
That it's all good
And you're not what you should
And I tried all I could
And I gave all I could
And I'm still giving you
All that I have

And you're holding me
And I'm wanting you
And it's all me and you
And I see you smile
And I hear you voice
And I call for the machine
And I obsess
And I squeeze
And I play guitar
And it itches
And I almost cried

Then you were gone
You were my salvation
You were my everything
And I left you
When you were ready
And I need a friend
I need you
And I left you 
I left everything 
I left my everything
Threw away all I've known 
Given away my freedom
Sold myself to slavery
Slapped a chain on my
own neck
made myself worthless
Left myself bare
Made myself the object
Sold my soul for you
And gave it up

Kissed your feet
Bore my emotions
Waited for you
all night
Thought of you
first period
Thought of you
second
Thought of you at lunch
And all day
And I waited for tomorrow
To see you
And I called 
On a pay phone
At school
And you promised 
But you didn't 
And I should have known
All the promises you've broken
But you worked
And I understood

'Cause you're all I want
And You're all I need
And you move me
And sometimes you 
Take my breath away
And at times I'm annoyed
And sometimes I expect too much
But sometimes I need so much
And you're everything
At times
And I need you
And I wish 
Ans I squeeze
And I cried
And the tears fell
And that was my end
You took me
You stole my strength
You stole my pride
You took my stubborn
No; it's not ok
Sometimes I hate you
But I'm incapable 
Because
I love you </center>

I'm gonna start by saying that I hate black people. Oh, black people made me angry before; before i joked about how black people suck and how they make me angry but it took me until tonite wednesday, november 2, 2005 at 11:37pm to truly <b>HATE</b> my own people. I've sat around my entire life getting a lil' on the defensive side when people tell me I'm white or that I act white, but why should I? It should be a fucking compliment. When someone says ""ur white"" i should be like ""thank you now can you convince the cops of that?""  Everyday in this world there are hundreds of people who are harassed by the police and end up in jail because they were forced to protect themselves. Fortunately for me I haven't been there, but I saw it tonight, how awful this world is. The men and women that our hard earned tax money go to are GOOD FOR NOTHING, <i><b>especially</b></i> the black people. There should be no quota and there should be no misuse of power, Well I witnessed a <b>BLATANT</b> misuse of authority tonight that makes me just want to go out and fucking kidnap torture and kill police officers cuz so many of them deserve it. They fucking deserve it. I was not wronged so bad tonight that I would feel like I were taking an 'eye for an eye' if I so happened to lose my mind and do some shit like that, but its a wonder someone doesn't do it. I hope they do and if I sat on the jury for that person's crimes i would make sure they got away with it because at least they got an 'eye for an eye' for someone who was wrongly accused or forced into a situation with a police officer when they didn't do anything. That's the intro... Here's my story:

I ride into campus to pick Jessica (my roommate) up because I dropped her there when I went onto campus to be with my sisters and study and I left by mistake without her and I realized it or whatever and I got ready to go to a party with some of my sisters and I drive back onto campus to pick her up and drop her here. Well I drove into campus onto carr st going in the direction in which Coit dorm is on my right. No I call Jessica and tell her that I'm there. And I pulled over to the right side of the rode and put my right turn signal all, because that's what you're supposed to do when you pull over and are waiting. This cop, officer Johnson is his name flashes his flashlight in my eyes from like down the rode. Now, I don't read minds nor do I know morris code or whatever so I didn't know what that meant so I turned my head cuz light in the eyes when its dark out hurts. He comes up to my car knocks on the passenger side window and says in a very rude tone: ""You have 5 seconds to move this car or I'm towing."" I assumed he was telling me to move my car because I was right at the end of a curve, so I pulled forward. I saw Jessica coming down the rode walking extremely slow I might add and the man came back to my passenger side window and yelled ""move the car you're in the road."" <i>Of course I'm in the road that's where cars are supposed to be</i>. Anyway, I tried to calmly explain to him that I was just picking up my friend and was not staying and when I said ""excuse me sir, could you please listen to me for a second,"" he cut me off midsentence and said and I quote (everything else is quoted also by the way) ""I'm not listening to you-"" and began to ramble about something else but I rolled my window up, because I will not listen to a pissy tail ass FUCKING NIGGER, yes NIGGER who won't listen to me. So he walked over to his car and turned on the siren lights... not the actual siren just the lights I guess to show that he's pulling me over. Now at this point JEssica is standing across the way on the sidewalk I guess waiting for the cop to go away or whatever. And he came up to my window and yelled ""put the window down."" I rolled down my back window because the front window is messed up. So he says still in as rude a tone as possible ""GIVE ME YOUR LISCENSE AND REGISTRATION."" And I looked at him and said ""Why?"" Because, by law he has to tell me why he 'pulled me over.' And he said: ""you're obstructing and delaying."" and I said ""All I'm doing is trying to pick up my friend and she's right over there."" and pointed her out. Then he used his little walky talky shoulder thing or whatever. And I began to pull out my liscense and I opened my door and I pulled out my registration after he asked me for it again. After I gave it to him he asked me to step out of the car. And I told him ""no"", because I didn't believe he had right to ask me to leave my car, which he didn't because if he had had the right officer Edwards -whom I'm assuming is his boss or sargeant or manager or whatever- would have probably asked me to step out of my vehicle as well. He said again ""you're obstruction and delaying now get out of your car or I'll pull you out of your car."" And my thoughts got the best of me and I said ""If you touch me..."" And I didn't finish my sentence or make any threat at him.  and he said ""you'll what?"" and I just turned my head, I believe that's when I believe I tried to close my car door, but he stood in the way and pushed against it. I said to him ""I gave you my liscense and registration so go ahead and write me a ticket if that's what you're going to do."" and he said ""I've asked you several times for your liscense and regiustration"" and I said ""and you have it so write the ticket if that's what you're going to do."" and he began to say ""it's too late for that I'm asking you to step out,"" but at the same time officer Edwards pulled up and began to get out of her car and the second she opened the door I said and I quote ""Excuse me ma'am."" and she came over and said ""yes."" I said ""This man pulled me over when all I did was pull to the side of the road so that I can pick up my friend who is right over there (I pointed). He's threatened to take me to jail he asked me for my liscense and registration and he has it so could you please tell him to go ahead and write me a ticket if that's what he's going to do so I can leave?"" And she nodded. Then he said ""ok, now..."" and pulled her behind my car to speak with her. Why he couldn't say what he thought while I was there is a mystery to me, but I don't care. Anyways. He went back to his car to write me a ticket or whatever and she went and sat in her car. And I called my mom to say what was happening and explain everything, so my mother stayed on the phone with me from 11:36pm until 12:11 when he finally decided to bring my ticket to the car. And I rolled down my back window again because my front window is messed up and he said he was giving me a ticket for obstructing and delaying because he asked me repeatedly for my liscense and registration and I wouldn't give it to him. And I nodded or whatever and I tried to take the paper out of his hand so I could go about my way and he pulled it back and kept talking while officer Edwards stood there, because I guess he could have gotten into some type of trouble if he hadn't saying all the bullshit he said. So I let him finish and he asked me if I had any questions and I said no. And Terance came up as the man was asking me my social security number and address and phone number, because my mom had called him. And my mom was talking to me at the same time and telling me not to give him certain information or whatever and guy started to yell at me and say ""you can talk to your mom later."" and I said ""my mother wants to talk to you."" and he said ""i cant talk to your mother right now."" and the woman said that she had tried to contact her while she was waiting in her car, but the line cut off or something. And I started to hand the phone to her instead my mom just said whatever that she's gonna complain about it tomorrow.  Terance walked up to my car just as the guy handed me my ticket and he asked me what the man said or whatever and I started to tell him and honked some horn or something and said some shit about me having 1 second to move. And Terance was just like ""just pull up there."" so I pulled into a lil paking lot at the bottom of the hill and he came down and looked at my tickets and junk. And I told Terance the quick story that I pulled over to wait to pick up my friend and the man started to give me shit and act retarded and that all he wanted to do was act like he has a little power or whatever. And Terance was like ""Thats exactly what it is he just wanted to act like he has a little power cuz its late."" And I stayed on the phone with my mom until I got in the door. 

I tell you I hate this world and I hate black people. If that woman officer had not come up I probably would be in jail right now because that's what the asshole guy wanted to do. And I'm not even saying like it's a sexest thing. Because his whole attitude changed when that woman came up and I won't say that she was on my side because she didn't say anything. It's black people. We don't know how to stick together, because we all think we're better than each other and it's not true. Yes, I act snooty like I'm 'better than everyone' cuz people tell me that I act that way, <i>but</i> I don't do it because I believe it's true I do it because I don't like people. Because <i>people</i> do things like that cop did to me tonight: try to exercise thei'r authority. The man had reason to give me a ticket after I spoke back to him, but he had no right to come to my window in the first place so all the crap afterward could have been avoided if he had <b>a.)</b> Calmly said, you can't park or wait here, you have to go down there and turn around <b>b.)</b> listened to me when I tried to tell him that I was just waiting for a friend, in which case he could have calmly told me that I couldn't wait there or <b>c.)</b> waited more than 35 seconds before trying to flash some shit in my eyes and knock on my window. It only took her like a minute or 2 to get to my car. If he hadn't tried to exercise some type of pompous authhority and tell me I couldn't pull over on that road he wouldn't have had to sit there and let every drunk person that walked by him get away, because to me that seems like a bigger crime than pulling over and waiting. Let's stress that I didn't put on my hazard lights and put my car in park and go in the building nor did I leave the car on and put it in park and stand outside of my car while leaving against it. I put my turn signal on and pulled to the right side of the road, but apparently that was illegal in his eyes because I was born with the same cursed skin colour as he was. I never use my colour as an excuse for anything, but I've always known I'd be treated differently because of it because my parents would tell me that when I was very young. And it's fine when you're in middle school and highschool and your teachers see black people as being stupid when 75% of them are seen during classes wondering about the halls aimlessly all day every day. It's not ok to think that we're all stupid, but it makes sense why you would make that assumption as a white teacher. But it doesn't make sense to me why the people who's salaries I pay -because yes I do work and pay taxes- would be so heinous toward anyone. Why did he even decide to become a cop? And is it so awful a job that he doesn't know how to speak to people? And if it is why not get another job? Granted jobs with benefits and security are hard to come by these days, but no one told him to become a cop. Just like no one told teachers to become teachers. Like no one told military men and women to become military men and woman. Like no one told the hoodlems on the streets to drop out of high school and join a gang. We are not forced to do the things we do, we choose them and if it sucks it's no one elses fault but our own. Like no one told Soma to become a real estate saleman and when he realized he hated it he went back to school and decided he wanted to be a doctor. And if I'm not mistaken he had to do 2 or 3 more years of undergrad work before going to medschool, but he's in med school now preparing to go into a field that would be more rewarding to him than selling property. 

My biggest problem with the whole incident is that that man is going to still have that job tomorrow and maybe not tomorrow or the next day or the day after, but some day he will find a way to ruin someone's life; that could be by unrightful search and seizure or whatevever else pulling someone out of their car and forcing them to fight him. I don't know. But somehow I know that he's going to continue to get away with doing unlawful shit like 'pulling me over' tonight and worse. And say by some divine right or prophecy he loses his badge and is no longer allowed to roam the streets pretending that he's helping the people of this world, there's a fucked up asshole who may not even be black he may just be racist or someone who interprets 'the law' too strictly who will get away with harassing and unlawfully pulling people over like him and that just makes me sad. I mean I can honestly say that tonight was not that serious. It could have been but it wasn't. I got a ticket which I will fight all the way to the ground. And my parents may not have money, but I don't care if it's necessary I'll take out a loan just to show that POS that he can't do shit like that do people and get away with it and to show people that that shit shouldn't be allowed to happen. 

About a month ago or so I told my mom that I'm going to change the world one day, if its the last thing I do. And i told her that because I know that it takes a long time to change people I will make sure my legacy lives on and that I build the stairs for others to walk up and take my place in doing what needs to be done and that is force this world that is the people in it to change. Its necessary. 
I'm going to go to bed. its 2:33am.

<font face=""Arial narrow"" size=""03"" color=""9B30FF"">
Ok so on Sunday shit went down with me and Jessica partially cuz when she walked in my door Theo was sitting on the couch. And She said so much shit to me its ridiculous. She had the nerve to say shit to me about my grades knowing good and well it annoys the hell out of me and that i <i>am</i> trying to pull them up. But oh she acts like she knows what its like to transfer school and be in a completely new school that runs a completely different way from the one u left and the one that u liked. I HATE THIS PLACE. I'll be the first one to say it if its necessary, but that's NOT what's getting in the way of my success at this school. I am getting in the way of my success and I have not once blamed ANYONE <i>but</i> myself for my failure NOT ONCE. So for her to sit there and say to me ""That shit that happened you were a kid is in the past now and it wasnt ur fault but u have no one to blame for where u r now but urself."" Never once have I blamed anyone else. NEVER ONCE. I got mad at a teacher who looked at me like an idiot and REFUSED to explain a concept to me. And she goes on talking about ""teachers know if u've been coming to their class and ur insulting them by going to them and asking for help when u go and ask them stuff, ur insulting their intelligence."" Ok it understandle if I'm just not going to class at all and not trying. After my first test that was when I buckled down and granted I should have been in class regularly anyway, but when I start coming to class regularly and we have a test the next week and come to my teacher and ask her to explain something to me I EXPECT a REAL MOTHERFUCKING ANSWER not ""u don't know what that is?"" NO I DONT FUCKING KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IT IS and here's jessica ""well ur insulting her profession by doing that. They can look u up on the computer and see ur major and say oh this is a class she needs well she must not care'"" REGARDLESS if that's what she did or not, students dont go to their teachers to ask them questions about things they dont understand so that they can know if for a test just cuz they dont care. Sorry that doesn't happen cuz I don't know anyone who would want to waste their time in a teacher's office. And the fact is that I'm over that now... I failed the test partially cuz I didn't know more than I thought I didn't know etc. Ok the test is over I HAVE to look toward the next classes and the next test, which is what i'm doing. When I told her that shit it had just taken place that week. Its over but she keeps bringing it up to say that that's an expectation of a highschool student. Well let's be real here... I could expect a teacher to say some shit like that to me when I was in highschool and be like 'ok thats fucked up of that teacher' BUT I WASNT SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL no I'm spending thousands of dollars a year in college and in college is where I EXPECT to get my monies worth out of the teacher. My monie's worth out of the teacher is not just classes it is her office hours when I need to ask a question and i want a REAL fucking answer when I go cuz otherwise I might as well just go to her office hours and sit there and talk to her to annoy the shit out of her to get that money if thatr makes sense to anyone besides myself. 

Then jessica had the nerve to tell me that saying my major was for my parents... I'm sorry let's stop this train ur rolling with jessica. MY MAJOR IS FOR ME. As with everything else I do. ITS FOR ME. Honestly I never even had a conversation about my major with my father. Hard to believe but it's true. My dad never came into my room and said ""so ur going to college have u thought about a major?"" actually that's a lie. He <i>DID</i> come into my room and use those exact words and I said ""yea"" and turned and went back to IM-ing people cuz that's what I did with my life in H.S. He came back later that night and asked me what I wanted to major in and I said ""psychology"" and he said ""ok... well what do you want to be?"" and i said ""a psychiatrist"" and he said ""ok. so you want to research what causes psychological ailments and try to make a cure or something?"" and i said ""no. I want to go to med school so I can treat people."" and because at that point in time I was sick of speaking to my father I again turned and continued to IM people. Whether him asking me that question was his reverse psychological way of getting me to tell him what I wanted to do with my life is in fact irrelevent because before that moment he didn't know what I wanted to do nor had he ever tried to instill some major into my brain. When I was little I wanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to Harvard. Harvard was out of the question then and it is now and honestly I dont wanna go to Harvard, but I <i>DO</i> want to be a doctor and I'm going to get there no matter what it takes. Yet she had the nerve to tell me I was insulting her profession because it wasnt something I really wanted to do or some shit because I'm supposed to act like I'm already a doctor or some shit. I'm like sorry to break it to u YOU CAN PRETEND UR AS HIGH AND MIGHTY AS YOU WANT TO. u can PRETEND that I'm insulting your future profession whenits the same one I want to go into but DONT YOU DARE tell me that oh i'm gonna retake bio I KNOW, dont tell me my major is for my majors ITS NOT and the fact that as my friend she believed that goes to show how little she knows about me today. 

Sometimes people fuck up and sometimes people get bad grades and this semester that is me, but I started out in the hole and I'm trying my best to dig myself out of it and to me that leaves her no right to say shit because shes not in my shoes. Whether I brought the bad grades on myself is irrelevant because I saw the bad grades andI'm working on fixing them I was on the dean's list all last year and I'll be on the dean's list again starting next semester. One bad semester is going to hurt me when applying to medical school but it will also help me to learn some stuff. I spoke to a health professions counselor and he gave me all of these papers that talked about like tips for pre-med professions and like careers and all that stuff but one of the tips on a list of 10 he gave me he pointed out to me specifically and it says  ""while grades are important, more than academic performance is considered. Grade trends are important; a less than spectacular year can be overcome."" Now obvisouly he didn't say that to me so I'd slack off. And Since a week or two before I even spoke with the man I HAVENT. She told me that I shouldn't get a job for blah blah blah reason. Ok first off... I wanted a job or internship that is in the field of my interest. Something dealing with sick or psychologically ill children. And I did look for jobs like that and I interviewed for jobs like that and those interviews were ones that I thought I did terribly in. So, because I needed money as well I started working at bruegger's again. 2 Weeks later I called in and quit on a day I was supposed to work because I was like ""i don't care. They don't pay me enough and I don't want to go."" I got the money that I had needed for what I wanted to do and the only thing I need a job for now is to pay my bills. Well 10 minutes after I quit that job I got a call from my worst interview ever and I'm going to be making twice and a half as much as I did at Bruegger's and I'm happy with that. My point is that she thinks I need to focus more on school and stuff. Ok my focus IS on school. The time I have now to complete my assignments is still going to be there and it will still get done. I might work once or twice during the week and then on weekends. Plus when I'm not busy I just end up procrastinatting and that's part of the reason I did so well at Hartford. Because, I had practices at 7pm and because I wouldn't get out and be settled in until around 11 I got my shit done... because I knew I wouldn't have any other time to do my shit, so it got done and it was awesome quality. When I'm sitting around for hours with all this time on my hands I dont get anything done. And that has been a fact about me since Needham. I did cheerleading and soccer and I got good grades and if I got a bad grade it was just cuz ""i didnt want to do it"" whatever the assignment. Well first quarter of freshman year in highschool I had AWESOME grades until I went to the hospital and things were shitty after that, but that's life I needed to be in the hospital oh well. Anyways for her to sit there and make accusations and try to make decisions for me like shes's my parent is ridiculous. As my 'friend' she's supposed to have faith in me and clearly she doesnt... but if ur calling urself my friend and uve lost respect for me and faith in me then ur not my friend and there's no point in even trying to have that conversation with me.

She also said that I haven't been a friend to her in the past year and that when she needed me when I was at hartford I never returned her calls until like weeks after the event took place and she didnt wanna talk about it anymore. And I'm sorry she feels that way. And I feel bad because I probably could have made more time to call her and chat, but I didn't know that things were so shitty when she'd e-mail me and say 'call me.' Granted if she e-mails and says call I should call, but if its so important that u need to talk to me I thought that she would say that, because <i>I</i> would say that. If I e-mailed her and it was that important I'd say that or call her myself. And I know that she had to use phone cards to call me so I can't blame her waiting for me to call on her thats my fault but she should have said it was so important that she needed to talk to me. Cuz in e-mails she would mention something about what she wanted to talk about and I thought it was just some long story she wanted to just tell me or gossip about. And I honestly thought the point of our ongoing e-mail was to be able to tell each other stuff and she says that she's a slow typer and when she's mad about something that she'd rather talk and not type, but if that's the way we're communicating and u know that u want to talk about something and not type it I expected her to tell me that in the e-mail cuz I don't know otherwise. If I had known then that it was so important to her then I would have called more often,but I didn't and that was a lack of communication issue, but in my opinion she cant be mad atme for that. She says that I went off and changed and YES I DID. I wanted to. She has no idea what its been like to be me, moving around and every place I've ever been to its progressively gotten harder and harder to make friends. She grew up in Raleigh; I DIDNT. For 2 years the only person I could call a friend was her and that means a lot to me, but I was sick and im STILL SICK of trying to be the person that my friends and parents and relatives want me to be. IM GLAD I CHANGED. Last year I could actually say that I was myself. When I was in Needham I dont know if I could have honestly said that I was true to myself and I was being the person that I was on the inside. Like with Irene and them <i>sometimes</i> I showed my true colours but I had lots of issues with being who they wanted me to be as well. So I'm sorry if she doesn't like the person I've become but that's life u have to grow up. And I had to grow up for myself whether whoever likes it or not. She accused me of seeing other people not go to class and think I could do the same thing. The truth is at Hartford I didn't go to class and I got A's and some people WISHED they could just not go to class and still get an A. We had jokes like ""Donna u should get some sleep""... ""who needs sleep when u've got A's."" I didn't not sleep cuz I didnt want to at Hartford I didn't sleep because I couldnt. And Jessica always says shit liek ""i know u have a sleeping disorder but..."" <b>NO</b> don't pull that shit on me because I have <b>NOT</b> blamed my grades or my life or my personality or relationships on not getting sleep, not since fucking 7th and 8th grade. And that was when I was diagnosed with my shit. After hospitalization in 9th grade I accepted it 'i have fucked up sleep patterns and theres a point at which i will be at risk of dying when i go to sleep just cuz i'll be old' I accepted it and I let it go. That's a part of my life and who I am now. I stay awake until really late or early hours and I finally get to sleep and I wake up in the middle of the afternoon and I go to classes and I do it al over again. And proof of the fact that I can't change my sleeping patters is the time when I slept for 72 hours straight and only got up twice to drink cranberry juice, pee and go back to sleep and the two times I got up no one was around. That's proof I can only sleep when I'm tired and I will only get up when I'm tired for essential things such as emptying my bladder and getting water water was the reason I drank the cranberry juice cuz I was dehydrated but I wasnt a water person at the time. I've alreayd overcome that shit so I never bring it up cuz thats not an excuse for me. Using my sleeping disorders as an excuse would be taking myself back to middle school and I will not and have not and do not plan to do that. 

She had the nerve to say that the way I was acting was the way a freshman in highschool would. As a freshman in highschool I was excessively mature but also stuck up. She didnt know me as a freshman in highshool and I have done nothing BUT MATURE and change gradually since Freshman year in highschool. I'm SO MUCH better at holding my anger and not letting it get to me and turn me into this depressed puddle of mud. And I've been so much better at not letting guys walk all over me. Cuz let's be honest the guys there have been since freshman year were Richard, jeffery, will, mike, richard, tony and dima and theo... now the first richard was like my first real boyfriend and we only broke up cuz i moved to the shittiest place on earth NC. He never tried to walk over me and if he had at the time I probably would have let him. jeff who was just a hook up did try to walk all over me cuz he treated me like crap in front of people and wanted to get a piece of ass when no one was looking and ok i let that take place and the same thing happened with will and they r the reason i dont like black guys because somehow i manage to let black guys EXCEPT mike walk all over me (that was my thought process when i decided that i dont like black guys)... if mike had been more agressive the first time we got together it probaly would have been a repeat of jeff and will but since it wasn't i realized what i needed and didnt want in my relationships so being with mike was more of a ledarning experience than a relationship... the second richard was <i>almost</i> a repeat but I realized it before it started and then it was over. Tony who was also only a hook up but a guy I wanted to date and almost started to date was nice to me. I never had issues with him until I started to act like a girlfriend and then he pulled away and I got over him thinking he didnt want a gf until I started seeing dima whos the best bf ive ever had and that was when tony told me he wanted to be my bf but thats life.. and since dima who was great there was theo whom i originally thought i wanted to date but realized i didnt want to date but also didnt want to get rid of because with him i was a bit unsure. jessica seems to think i let him walk over me but she wasnt <i>here</i> for it. u cant pass judgement when all u get is complaints from me because im only gonna complain when something is bothering me and I'm not really the one to talk about all the good stuff its more just me complaining to get shit off my chest so that i dont have to harbor it. granted theo was pretty much living with me for like 6 weeks its not like he didnt have a place to stay or whatever. He stayed with me because <b><i>I</b></i> wanted him to and he stayed here <i>because</i> he knew that I wanted him to. He didn't really eat here most of the time because I doubt he felt comfortable coming in here and cooking something or whatever which was fine but the few times he did eat here a lot of stuff got gone fast and what did he do? he gave me money for groceries. In the beginning I gave him rides to lots of places and when I finally told him that he was inconvienencing me by asking me to take him somewhere all the time he stopped. And the few times after that when I drove him somewhere he offered me gas money which is the polite thing to do. He was someone that I liked. Whom I kept around for whatever the reason I don't really know but things were fine until we got into a fight and he hit me. Now taking him back was stupid on my part and that was me showing my weakness with men and putting up with the way they treat me when its bad, but for me thats and issue and it has been. And its not like I don't think I'm pretty or worth more or whatever. I do think I'm pretty. When I look in the mirror the only thing wrong with my face that I can pick out is usually as small at a black or white head on my nose and the bags under my eyes from years of not sleeping. and i dont wear makeup all the time, but the bags arent something that I cant cover up with makeup. But to myself I look fine without makeup which is y i dont wear it very often. as far as my body goes I still think i'm fat and I want to lose weight and Ive started my low cal regimen again. Ive seen fat though so I don't think I'm a disgustingly large size I just want to lose weight so that when I buy pants that the thighs will fit better and I dont have to worry about the jeans wearing out where my thighs are. I don't like the largeness of my lower belly because I like low-rise jeans and I don't like wearing long t-shirts so thats something that hangs out and looks unattractive to me. besides those things which r fixable which r not that bad looking I like myself. I liked my personality cuz its actually me. The problem with me and men is that when I first started getting attention from guys I was not in the mindeset that I am now and <i>did</i> have low self-esteem and I did think I was this huge obese-looking person, but I wasn't. And I see how I was with guys then I know how I was and I know y I was like that which is y im not and wont be like that anymore. But for me at this point and I know I'm not the only person I am easily won over by the way I am treated in the beginning of a relationship because when I was younger I didnt get that, so now when a guy calls me just to say like 'i just wanted to see how u were doing' i feel good and when a guy comes to my house on a really busy day just to drop off an x-mas present and say 'dont open it while im here cuz i dont know if u'll like it' and leave i think thats kute and getting the present makes me feel good and when guys r like 'let's go out to dinner where do u wanna eat?' it makes me feel good because I believe that I am worth that treatment so that's what I expect from guys now. So when I started seeing Theo and he came over and I saw that I could really easily talk to him i felt good and when he was here and we woke up early in the morning and he was like 'lets go get breakfast' even tho i had to drive us i liked that he had the consideration for me to ask me if i wanted to go because he couldve gone with any one of his friends to breakfast any day. that is that he couldve gotten up <i>without me</i> and gone downstairs and gone to breakfast with his lil friend and I wouldve woken up alone; instead he waited for me. And I liked that. The only thing I didn't like was our living together. He got on my nerves with stupid stuff like using a new bathcloth and towel every day  and leaving his shoes in front of my closet door and his pants in the middle of my floor and not making up my bed if he left after i did those things annoyed the hell out of me and they r proof that im not yet mature enough to live with someone im dating, but i dont think i need to be. Also the only other bad thing about him was that he wouldn't give me the gf title, which after a while I got over because I knew where he was during the day and I knew he was with me at night so I <i>was</i> his girlfriend without the title and when u think about it when u get older u dont just give that title to people... that's highschool and I liked having the title only because I wanted to feel secure but I realize now that the title is not that important when its at the boyfriend/ girlfriend level. fiance is different... wife is different but bf/gf its not that serious but ya know after like 6 months and theres no title i'd prolly want it at that point... but he and i were like a 2 month thing that was serious but shouldnt have been as serious as it was because i wasnt ready for that. Anyways the point is that I'm mature enough to be in my present situation and handle it my way without jessica telling me what to do. And I'm mature enough to be in the situation cuz I can point out things that I did wrong and I can do them differently for the next time; granted, it took me 2 diff guys to figure out the guy problem but part of it was that they came one after the other too quickly for me to have time to think about it

And the last thing that I need to get off my chest is jessicas <b><i>AUDACITY</b></i> to tell me that I shouldn't hang out with my sisters. She had the nerve to say that she doesn't think I'm in a good place right now and that they're not good for me. Ok the girls that I chill with on weekends drink. Wow its college big suprise girls who r a part of a social organization like to drink and party on weekends. I'm sorry THATS NORMAL. NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL! She was like ""u should stop drinking."" and I said ok at first but now that I've thought about it FUCK THAT! I have fun drinking. On Friday and Saturday night when I've been through a long ass week of school I LIKE to go out to a party and drink its FUN. I started drinking in Highschool and I went out on weekends to parties with friends got plastered and talked about it afterward and we laughed about how stupid the other one acted. Before about a month ago I had never been so drunk that I threw up and I had never been so drunk that someone had to take care of me or watch over me. When Jessica was there and she did that it was <i>HER</i> decision only and not mine. At the prom party when I got drunk and started running I had a reason for running; I wanted to see Ben take off his clothes and fo swim in the lake or river or whatever was back there but he ended up not doing it. At the prom party when I was drunk and sitting on the rock with her waiting for my parents to come pick us up I didn't really say much and when I got in the car i fell asleep and didnt say shit to my parents. When I got drunk and threw up a month ago at a party with my sisters that jessica and patrice left me at because they were bore my sisters let me drink because they figured i would stop when i needed to. I wanted to test my tolerance that night which is the reason I drank so much. Unfortunately, I tested my tolerance and got to a drunkeness that I never want to be at again, but because I went through that I know my new tolerance now. And obviously the way to test ur tolerance is not the way that I did it which is having a lot of high percentage of alcohol beverages one after the other after the other. And I'm glad Jessica was there to take care of me, but she can't say that shes sick of doing it because that has only happened once. It never happened at hartford with anybody else and the one time it happened in highschool it wasnt as bad and it was like my first time drinking in a social setting anyway and i didnt throw up i was just stupid for drinking when i was on medication cuz it intensified the effect and little bit of snow in my face from a big pile outside was all it took for me to 'sober up' persay. I'm not gonna stop doing the things that I enjoy for her. And I'm not gonna let her choose my friends for me cuz i dont do that to her and I didn't like the people she started hanging out with at A&T. The only time I ever said anything was because they were rude I didnt want them in my car and she realiszed it then too, but I would never judger her based on her friends or decided that i dont like her friends and that they arent good for her because thats fucked up. I would be insulting her intelligence the way she did to me by doing that. She can dislike my sisters all she wants to but I'm not gonna stop talking to them because she thinks I'm in a bad place or situation or whatever cuz i'm not and that's dumb of her to pull out of her ass. Besides the fact that she was the one who encouraged me to get to know them. I was going to get to know them anyway I was just having trouble letting go of my routine of hanging out with her and patrice on weekends. SHE encouraged it then had the nerve to tell me that i pushed patrice away. NO I DIDNT push patrice away. Patrice and I kinda stopped talking on the week when I had to do 6 study hours in one week go to all my classes 2 tests and a midterm, a job interview AND an interest party. Now it's understandable y we would have stopped talking because its under the same principle as the reason i stopped really talking to christina... christina is very interested in herself likes to listen to u talk about anything but boys unless she has one in which case she can talk about hers and u can talk about urs but not if she doesnt have one... Same principle; if i called christina when she was with scott or whatever boy she was with or is with she would say 'well he's here we're gonna go do this but later tonite we can all do something and i'll call u' andlater that night she wouldnt call and if i called her shed be busy doing something else or whatever... so thats y i stopped really talking to her... the week when patrice and i really fell off i had all that shit to do and for a week or 2 before that when i really started trying to get to know my sisters she would call me and I would just say ""im on campus with my sisters"" assuming that she didnt wanna hang out with a group of girls that she didnt know that she probably didnt really wanna get to know because if i called her and she said she was with her sisters and invited me along i wouldnt wanna go because id wanna spend time with her and shed wanna spend time with both... and i know how i am if she had been there i wouldve only talked to her or only talked to my sisters and i dont know which one it wouldve been i just know it wouldve been one or the other. i feel like if i had invited her along she wouldve declined anyway but as a friend i shouldve done that... and the week when i had all that shit to do she happened to call me a bunch when i was in study hours and i'd answer and say i was in study hours and tell her id call her back and i wouldnt end up calling her back till either really late or at all... but one day that week i told her id call her back and i did and it was like midnight but she and i used to take midnight trips to walmart all the time so i asked her if she wanted to go to walmart even tho i didnt need to go and she said yes and i got held up so i didnt end up leaving the hall and getting back to my apt until like 30 mins later and when i called her when i got back she was like ""u can go on im gonna go to bed."" which is understandable because it was like 12:30 at the time even tho she and i did it on a regular basis before that... After that week we like stopped talking... And I understand that. I did to her what Christina did to me but jessica has no right to try to throw it in my face because i didnt purposely say ""oh hey... im just gonna ignore her because im making new friends."" No thats not how it took place at all. And I'm sorry if a busy week is a REALLY busy week for me, but thats the story of my life. When I have enough things on my plate the way I like it when I'm busy i TRULY am busy and there's very little 'me time' in that day or week or 2 weeks... And I don't do that purposely it just happens that way. I like being busy and when I'm busy on a normal basis then its inevitable that there will be a point when a lot of things come at me or pile up and i work my but off to get it all done. 

But anyways... I went to bed at 11pm its 5:10 now. I woke up at like 3 something and couldnt go back to sleep which sucked... But i'm gonna attempt to go back to bed cuz now that I've said all that I need to say and it should all be gone from my head I should be able to get some rest. g'nite to whoever reads my journal.</font>

Oh yea and P.S. Dima's gotta girlfriend now. U wanna know what he said ""its been too long without a girlfriend."" I asked him what i should do about x-mas and he said ""i dont know."" So I told him i wouldnt bother so he could be happy with her. And he laughed. He said shes prude and that i may not last long. And i told him she'd be krazy to give him up and he said that i may be the other way around cuz he doesn't know how long he could take a prude girlfriend. I had no idea what the fuck to say to that. What if I had made him wait longer???  He wouldve broken up with me? he said he still cares about me or whatever and then said ""plus your seeing all these guys down there some not sucessfully."" I didnt expect him to wait for me forever. I didn't, but somehow I thought I'd have more time to be able to put myself by his side again. He said shes from his hometown and very old fashioned kind of like his grandmother. He's FUCKING DATING A RUSSIAN GIRL HOW THE HELL DO I COMPARE TO A RUSSIAN GIRL. He can talk to her and relate to her better. Granted she won't have sex with him but I didn't see that as being a major part of our relationship. I mean, I was happy to do it with him, but I didn't do it for myself. I don't know what upset me about it most... the fact that she can relate to him better than I can or the fact that hes truly beyond my reach now. I don't know maybe I shouldnt try anymore. Maybe I should give up on everyone I know and just be alone, because let me tell ya it sucks but at least no one can let me down or make me feel bad or make me cry. I ACTUALLY cried. I didnt cry over Will. Or anyone besides the first Richard for that matter which is understandable as my first boyfriend ever. I cried and we were already broken up. I cried then too. I was a friggin MESS that day. And tonite again. And i dont know if this is another time when I'm letting the guy hurt me. But the first thing I thought was that if i had pulled the money out of my ass to go see him a month or so ago in maryland before he lost his liscense when he asked me to meet him there because he wanted to see me before he lost his liscense if i had seen him then that he wouldnt be with her now. Like the job offer he got in NC I wish he hadnt told me and that I could keep pretending like he'd be around for me forever and that I could IM him when i want and tell him that I love him or text him or call him and say it knowing that i mean it and thinking that it actually means something to him. </font>
<font face=""Arial narrow"" size=""03"" color=""9B30FF"">
I just hate the way everything is going right now. And its ALWAYS like this when I move everything turns to shit and I have to dig my way out of a shithole and pretend like everything's great when its not and there r more than a few times that I can honestly say I enjoyed and that the sky is blue when its always been gray to me. I'm not depressed. I'm self-centered. And I'm not pessimistic. I'm realistic. I actually felt comfortable enough with dima to be my real self. He was the first person i showed my changed real self to... And he s gone from me and thats not his fault or my own its life. taking place before my very eyes and shit like that always happens so why should i have ever come out of my shell to be the real me and try to live a real life inside of the box instead od outside of it like in middle school and highschool? Why? What's the point anymore? I have a plan for my life. And to me for the past 2 years reaching my career goal has been the main thing i could think of. But let's think about it; I want to be a psychiatrist because I thik I can be better than the ones I've been to; I want to be a psychiatrist so that I can afford to take care of my family on my own and that doesn't mean i want my husband to be jobless it means i want my husband to have a career that makes enough money to take care of our family on his own so that we can spoil our kids with the extra money we have; I want to be a psychiastrist so that I can help people cuz I dont think that I was helped because for me dealing with things and realizing things comes to me through speaking and writing in diaries and stuff, so going to a psychiatrist and spending all that money was stupid because my diaries helped me and i dont think it was worth the money if just listening to me was all they did. I want to be a psychiatrist because I don't feel like everyone needs medication, i didnt. And I know that I didn't because I stopped taking my medication my sophomore year of highschool and I was fine no i wasnt harboring supressed unconscious emotions because I felt better. Letting my medication sit on my book case and be a reminder of where and what I came from and grew up out of was enough. I wrote in my diary until I had no more to say. And I don't even really need a diary that much anymore. I've used this journal like twice in the past like 4 or 5 months maybe even 6 cuz i dont remember what the last thing I wrote was... Everyone needs to talk about stuff and get things off their chests some probably more than others cuz i know once i get in a place where i feel like i need to get something off my chest i talk about it even if its to myself aloud and then I'm fine. But I don't know if I want to be a psychiatrist because I really want to help people like I tell the people who ask me y I want to do it. I've never really helped anyone before. I gave my last 35 cents to a begger in boston when i was in like 5th grade or something iwas walking with irene. I gave my salad and french fries to a woman outside of ham's who said she was in a hotel with her son and needed money for food or something and she was probably lying and wanted money for drugs cuz it doesnt make sense for u to be able to afford to stay in a hotel but not be able to afford to eat but I gave her my food. And I remember a time when Irene was crying and I said stupid stuff to make her laugh. And I gave terance half my x-mas money once as a present; that didnt make me feel good cuz i was coaxed into it by my mom who said since hes in college he should have more money than me but ive always believed she likes him better than me and i still do. I treated Dima to 2 meals when we were in MD ::shrugs:: but he treated me to MAAANNNY more before that. I gave Rachael one of the pillows I had sewn by hand that I really liked when I found out she got into a car accident. I told her that she looked like she needed a pillow and handed it to her and later when she tried to give it back i told her to keep it. I hooked Lia up with that guy we met in dunkins that day in 9th grade... i thought he was kute too but i hooked her up with him instead of being selfish and getting myself in there. Those r all the times I can think of when I actually did something for someone other than myself and they arent very big or memorable. But when I think about how rewarding it would be to be able to REALLY TRULY help someone. Help them so much that they remember me and what I did for them; I think about what I want to be. But I also know that I'll have a lot of patients who won't think I helped them who won't remember me... eh... whatever I think I think too much. I'm callin it quits for real this time... its 6:17am... hopefully i can go to sleep now. so g'nite to whoever reads my journal.

<marquee>Who's that girl livin' my life?</marquee></font>


<font face=""arial narrow"" color=""9B30FF"" size=""03"">I don't know where to begin... I wish I could have stayed at Hartford... cuz at Hartford I wouldn't be failing all my classes, cuz t hartford I'd have a teacher who actually cared to help me or explain something to me... I hate it here... UNCG makes me wanna like drop out of college... very discouraging. The only good thing that has happened to me here was joining tri-sigma. My rel. with Gizzle is becoming more and more shady cuz I feel like she's always harassing me or nagging me about something... like that I never talk to her anymore or whatever and she doesnt understand that I'm busy. And she annoys me so much now every time I talk to her that I just don't want to talk to her anymore a lot of the time. And the first guy I met who could compare to Dima in the slightest bit turned out to be the biggest asshole, yet I'm the dumby who likes him and I hate myself for it. <b>I HATE NC</b> being here is the biggest self-esteem reducer ever. I hate it. I feel like I have no support system and it sucks. Obvisouly, I'm supposed to be able to count on my sisters to be there for me, but let's be real... I don't use the term 'friends' lightly therefore the term 'sisters' isn't gonna be any different. I say sisters just so I can get myself used to saying it, but I haven't been able to get close enough to anyone in the past 5 weeks that I could let in on all the stuff that Jgizzle knows. 

I hooked up with a lambda chi alpha last nite... I met him last nite and I hooked up with him last nite how sad and pathetic is my life??? and hes this like scrawny short guy so not even close to my normal standards... but I was drunk and at the time he was kute, but if I'm not mistaken he has a lil gap in his teeth and if i see him again and I'm sober its gonna annoy the hell outta me. Oh yea and let's talk about how he asked me if I wanted to do him: ""r u wantin' some dick?"" WOW!!!!! ok... last semester if anyone besides Todd had asked me that <i>in that way</i> I would have laughed in his face so I don't know what the hell is wrong with me but it needs to go away. 

Like ok... I said I feel like my selfr-esteem is low... and I won't say that cuz when I'm not drunk my standards are still pretty high with the exception of Theo cuz I was blinded by his initial likeness to my Beba... but he's so not at all and not worth my time... but I let him back in cuz I'm a dumbass. But I don't know. Part of the problem is that a lot of girls in my sorority r engaged and a bunch in very serious relationships on the verge of engagement and I'm the girl who has yet to be in a relationship for longer than 6 months. I need a guy like Dima who can be everything I want him to be while being himself. I don't want a guy that I have to shape and mold and change and bitch at all the time like Mike B. It's stupid I dont want to do that. If he lacks in looks and makes up for it in personality and everything else I'm great. There were like 2 things about my Beba that if I had the power to change I would have considered, but also I liked him the way he was before I noticed those 2 things... It was his personality and his hoensty that I saw and liked first... and I thought I saw something of the sort in Theo but it was just me wanting him to be like Dima and he's not and never will be and I see that and know that now but I don't know how to end it completely without still wanting to be with him because in some way I've become attached and i HATE it. 

And I know its bad to compare other guys to Dima because I'll always be let down, but its so hard when I've met a guy that I feel like I couldve possible spent the rest of my life with... granted I don't want to be married for 10 years but I want to be in a real relationship before that I want to find someone that I can be with before then...

On a more playful note... one of my sisters and I r making lists of things we want to do before we die. I'm gonna post mine here but in a diff entry on another day... gotta go to bed so I can get up and do 2 projects that r gonna take all day."

It's been a while... Here's the scooop to anyone who cares... I'm dating this guy named Dima who lives in CT... he's a sweetheart and I like him... He asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend on feb 26 or 27... I thought it was the 27th but I have a voicemail that came on the 26th on which he called me sweetie so I dunno now lol... but anyways we've pretty much been with each other every day since then... well if u include the 3 times we hung out before that then its 3 days before the date lol... but anyways.... so the guy i was just hooking up with before, Tony was pissed when he found out... he like hates me now lol... awesome... Tony claims that he didnt know that I wanted a bf and that I should have told him before so that me starting to date someone wouldnt have been such a shock to him... he proceded to tell me that he thought we were ""together"" as hook up buddies... and ok I'll give that to him cuz I told him that if he hooked up with other chicks that I wouldnt do him anymore... but thats just cuz I dont want what any other chicks have... but he agreed to it or whatever but anyways... I guess I kind of hurt his feelings but oh well... I spoke to him a few days after that convo and he said that we were friends but i never considered us friends cuz friends hang out with each other and dont have sex... but whatever anyways... back to Dima and thats pronounced (dee-muh) <i>not</i> (dim-muh). 

I'm a wee bit on the annoyed side with him tonite just cuz he and I get into blanket fights at night when I sleep over there and he told me that I had to bring my blanket to his house otherwise I'd just be assed out for a blanket...So i brought it over there and I forgot it today when he brought me back to school and hes like ""im not driving over there to bring u ur blanket..."" hes like im tired blah blah blah blah blah blah anyways so im blanketless and ok bee he lives 15-20 mins away and didnt want to make the drive just to drop it off ok fine understandable but dont get mad at me when i get mad at u.... cuz thats just not allowed... 

so yea that guy richard... bad shit wwent down... he promised me he'd come up here the weekend before v-day... and that wasnt my doing i didnt ask him he said he was coming and got me excited which was really shitty of him cuz i told him all about the crappy guys i meet and he turned out to be one of them I was so angry... but anyways this is how it went down:

The asshole said he'd be here on the 11th and I went like a week and a half without talking to him I had this awesome v-day present lined up and the day was approaching so I called him not wednesday just before the 11th but the wednesday before actually it may have been monday I asked him if he was still coming and we had a sshort conversation i was like ""yay"" so then I didnt speak with him for another week so I called him on that wednesday to double check only some girl answered the phone and was like ""hes gonna be in south carolina for the next 2 months"" and i was like ""what the fuck"" but yea so then I was mad and I had already gotten my hopes up and made his v-day present which was a huge ass poster sized collage of myself framed and everything... but hes a fucking no show... wow, my anger... but anyways... havent spoken to him he hasnt called me or anything so fuck him... fuck him up the ass with a fucking 10 foot pole and we'll see how far it takes him... grrrrg I hate people like that... honestly it wasnt <i>me</i> who was like ""richard will u come visit me please please please i love u muah muah muah"" no...I could have been fine with us not deciding to date until the summer or deciding not to date at all or whatever...I wouldnt have expected anything of him if he hadnt brought it up himself... I could have been perfectly fine with him being my hook up for the summer when I go home... I could have been if he hadnt fucking pretended that he actually wanted a relationship... but he did so whatever... thats kool though cuz like ive said before and this goes to every person who has wronged me in my life every last asshole I've ever met, each one of them will fall each one of them will crumble and I will be there to see each one fall to pieces in their own shit... (angery management lol) 

oh yea... life lesson: 18th birthday in college SUCKS... so do ur best to turn 18 before college.. cuz not only will u go through an entire week of people calling u a youngin but thats alllll u'll get... couple happy birthdays from some nice or fake people fake smiles r usually the indication of fake people... but yea there will be no fun... I havent gotten my tattoo yet but I will... I almost feel like waiting until summer to get it done at Blueflame.. I think I will... or put the money i got from my rents in my bank account and save it and ask for more money in a couple weeks so that I wont have to worry about not having enough money cuz right now I have like 120 which isnt gonna be enough and I dunno... eh... I think most of the excitement for me came from me being able to say ""im 18 im gonna go get a tattoo"" Ive been thinking about the design for months so its not like I would regret putting it on my body but its almost kinda lost its appeal since my dad told me to spend my money on better things and its been almost a week... I'm thinking since I'm not going home for spring break- which starts in like 2 days, that I'll tell my dad that I need new shoes more shirts and like another pair of pants or so and just shop cuz I can... and I'll blow the money he gives me and the tattoo money on that... Neil gave me 25 bucks to put toward the tattoo... hate to sound bitchy or ungrateful but how far did he think 25 bucks would go??? lol sometimes that guy doesnt think... nice gesture though Ill give him that 

oh yea on saturday night before my b-day Dima took me to a Japanese place for dinner in Manchester, CT... the place was pretty expensive.... it was very sweet of him... I was soooo bright and smiley on the inside lol... when we finished eating he asked me if I wanted dessert and I assumed it would be too expensive at the place we were at and I was like ""maybe we should go somewhere else for dessert"" so I told him that we should go to friendly's cuz it was the most inexpensive place I could think of and he was like ""ok"" so yea... we got ice cream at friendly's and went to his friend Missy's place... I think her name is Missy something like that it starts with an M... but yea we chilled there and thats where I turned 18 and he talked for hours with her bf and I watched tv while they talked over it lol and then we went back to his place around 3 or 4am... and we had planned to take a day trip to Vermont on my actual birthday which was Sunday but our b-ball team won so I had to be here to fucking watch a tv with the team and my squad grrrrrg how angry did that make me... all we did was watch a damn television WTF... I should have told my coach that I wasn't gonna be around I should have been like ""my boyfriend is taking me somewhere for the day... he didnt tell me where but its my birthday and I'm going"" but yea... I didnt and I wish I had... </font>

<font face=""arial narrow"" color=""FF33CC"" size=""03""> oh yea... I told my mom about Dima and she doesn't quite approve of me dating a a 6'3, 330lb russian guy... she didnt bother to ask me how old he is... she just went on about cultural differences and proceeded to make 'fat jokes' she like ""c'mon LaDonna ur not big"" and I was like ""I know"" and she goes ""why would you go with someone that big? you don't need some big guy to hold you down"" UGH shes like ""you just like fat guys"" Its not like I go like ""oh hes fat Ive got to have him"" Ive just come to the point where I dont see it anymore... obviously I can tell that hes much larger than everyone but whats it matter if he makes me happy? even if its temporary... listening to her say that kinda made me envy Christina... the fact that I could envy her- a person that I call my friend, makes me feel like I have sooo much to work on...  its so pathetic of me... I dunno its dumb... before I was too picky now im not pick enough??? I dunno my moms like ""skinny guys with money"" grrrrrg and no I wouldnt tell christina that I think her bf is hot... but could someone in this fucking world tell me why the hell guys that look like him dont look at me?!?!?! 'course I'm gonna feel bad if either of the two of them read this (dima and stina) but they r gonna have to deal with the fact that Im their silent angry friend... oh yea and Im NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT saying that I don't like Dima...  I'm soo not saying that... for me hes PERFECT personality wise.... for me hes PERFECT height wise... and if I wanna follow mommy's words hes PERFECT money wise for me... he has a kute face... those kute chubby cheeks... yea his hair is weird but hes comfortable with it so so what... hes muscular and I like that hes got a lot of fat on top of those muscles which isnt healthy but it doesnt bother me... its not like he takes his shirt off and I get grossed out and wanna tell him to put it back on... I like him so fuck everybody else... :-( My mom even said some shit about me when she was talking about his weight shes like ""hes gonna make u get right back fat again after you lost all that weight"" I'm still trying to lose weight and it is kind of hard when theres no one there to remind me that eating foods that are too fattening will make me gain weight... and he says hes dieting even tho he just eats whenever he wants and eats just before going to bed and so on but whatever I'm just gonna have to be extra careful about my eating and continue my 1300 cals a day strictly until I go home and have jessica to keep me in line... I'll starve myself before I get over 210lbs again...  but I dont have an eating disorder I swear... but anyway that shit my mom said just made me really upset and mad not to mention Alex's boyfriend Jason making fat jokes when I told him about him too... he goes ""c'mon u cant make up a reason for that"" and I go ""its not his fault his mom fed him"" and he goes ""sounds like everybody fed him"" and then he was like ""I'm wanna come down with u to meet him so he can get my stamp of approval"" and i was like ""no I'm not introducing u to him"" plus katie and my roommate and melissa and her bf met him and all said he was sketchy... we stood outside and talkked for like a total of 45 fucking seconds and hes sketchy... I HATE PEOPLE I HATE THEM I HATE THEM I HATE THEM I HATE PEOPLE ALL TOGETHER... 45 seconds is NOT enough time to get to know someone 45 seconds is NOT enough time to judge someone ps who died and made us jesus to judge someone cuz last I hear he was already dead... and when marissa realized that I like him and dont think hes sketchy shes like ""i dont think hes sketchy cuz u like him"" WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT.... no thats not good enough... she thinks hes sketchy and thats it... she has no other contact experiences with him to decide that she doesnt think hes sketchy...</font><font face=""arial narrow"" color=""dodgerblue"" size=""03""> ::sigh::</font>

Dima took me to Needham not last weekend but the weekend before at like 2am it was really funny... i told him i wanted to go for a drive and we drove to needham... it was fun and I liked spending the time with him... but anyways i need to shower and go to bed if i wanna go to the gym in the morning...

It's been a while... but if anyone was wondering I had fun seeing JJ and kissy Kissying him... I'm kind of mad at him now but its a long story and my new years revolution is to learn how to tell short stories... and since this story is just long in general I won't tell it... but if u want a story of the day type story you can ask me... :-) 

X-mas was chill I guess... I met a guy named Richard when I was at home... MY original plan was to hook him up with Jgizzle... that didn't really work out... I hooked up with him a little... Strangely enough I don't really feel bad about it. Usually I'd feel bad cuz its like stabbing JJ in the heart, but... </font> <font face=""arial narrow"" color=""dodgerblue"" size=""04"">

So Bush is here for another 4 years until someone assasinates him 
*cough cough* i wonder who... lol.... I hope the CIA doesnt like find this website and look for me hahaha..... 
but just in case no names today lol... whatever hahaha... 
my roomie and i were just talking about it like shes like ""thats right agent 212"" i go ""i concurr agent 213"" so we decided we'd spell out our names with like the phone digits hahaha
me: agent 5236662
she: agent 6274772
hardy har har har.... yes im deeply PISSED and frustrated that I live in a country full of so many dumbasses that would vote for Bush after seeing what he has gotten us into in the past 4 years... <i>uhhh durrrr did u think it was gonna get better?!?!?!?</i> NO... Bush is gonna be dumb and reinstate the draft like an asshole... and this is how u'll catch me.... everyone is gonna have to put on their thinking caps and imagine this one ready?
here goes:
When Bush reinstates the draft... you will catch me on the beach in Australia during my last 2 months of pregnancy rubbing my belly enjoying a nice cold smoothie staring off into the distance beside my husband who will be SOMA... with my maternity clothes on...stomach big as hell cuz im having twins... then u'll catch me in the hospital upset that they wont cut the baby out unless its a health hazard so i HAD to go through the natural birth thing even tho im a woos... THEN 10 months later.... after they've asked my parents where i am and my parents told then because my parents dont lie that im in Australia... this will be the conversation: 
""I'm sorry Mr. President but I hate you and if u want me to go to war I want u in the front line and ill be RIGHT BEHIND u...umm 'excuse me.... im sorry??? Oh no... I know... This guy... uh-uh... LOOK... I have two children sitting next to me, one boy and one girl who are BOTH ciitizens of Australia and Australia is where the hell I'm staying... I'm coming back???? watch me..."" That would be where I hung up.....  
and about a month or so after that you'll catch me in the US prison because I guess it would be called abandoning the US or something but either way I won't be dying in any war... so dont u worry about me guys.... 
C'mon guys do you <i>reeeeeellly</i> wanna see me like that??? i think not... 

and there are <marquee><font size=""04"">19 days left till I Kissy Kissy my JJ</font></marquee><font face=""arial narrow"" size=""03"" color=""dodgerblue"">
So here's the 19th day's song which is not a love song but a song about politics and I figure since JJ's the love of my life he'll understand:

<font face=""arial narrow"" size=""03"" color=""red"">
<p align=""right"">
<b>""Your Silence""</b>

War for profit can nothing stop it
punish those unloyal war for oil
we dominate we obliterate
world economics and other countries
U.S. policy hands in everything
our intervention ends in destruction
collateral damage the pack is rabid
foaming at the mouth awaiting the feast

Your Silence 
Equals your death

War for peace it doesn't fool me
the guise of freedom blindly leading them
foolish sense of pride for the rich you die
media whitewash blood is the cost
the innocent dead use your fucking head
Protest and survive don't believe their lies
A million reasons to believe 'em
A million reasons A million reasons


Equals Your Death 

You said politics don't concern me and that's 
just fine so sing along to the radio's love song
and when they reinstate the draft you'll be the
first to go you're 23 so when you're in Iraq
staring into the eyes of the man who's the enemy
with skud missles streaming over your head remember
when you said ""Politics don't concern me""
what you gonna do it's either gonna be him or
you what you gonna do you're just a pawn you're
just a tool what you gonna do gonna die at the
age of 23 what you gonna do still say ""It Doesn't
Concern me""
The world is spinning out of control 
It's all about money </p></font>

<b>Taking Over Me</b>

you don't remember me but i remember you
i lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
but who can decide what they dream?
and dream i do...

i believe in you
i'll give up everything just to find you
i have to be with you to live to breathe
you're taking over me

have you forgotten all i know
and all we had?
you saw me mourning my love for you
and touched my hand
i knew you loved me then

i believe in you
i'll give up everything just to find you
i have to be with you to live to breathe
you're taking over me

i look in the mirror and see your face
if i look deep enough
so many things inside that are just like you are taking over

i believe in you
i'll give up everything just to find you
i have to be with you to live to breathe
you're taking over me

i believe in you
i'll give up everything just to find you

<marquee><b>40 MORE DAYS</b></marquee></font>
<font face=""arial narrow"" color=""dodgerblue"" size=""03""> I don't think anyone understands my like anxiety right now... I keep having this like recurring dream of me and JJ on my last nite... I can like watch us from the doorway and its weird as shit... I fucking miss him to no end aaaaahhhhhh.... I'm dying. I'd describe the dream but it'll end up being a book then no one will read it so my effort to explain my dreams would be a waste... so if u wanna know ask me and I'll tell you... 

Cell phone should be here on monday i so0o0o0o excited... and then i can get my refund check from the school wo0o0o... <b>monies</b>!!!!!! 

oh yea and the story of the day which is NOT a convo:
Today in english we got our papers back. the teacher read a few peoples' thesis statements as examples to the class of what a good thesis statement is and how it should be developed and not just stated... lol so she reads like the first paragraph from a few peoples stories and then she starts reading mine i'm like ""wow...pretty good eh?"" i say this to myself of course... so yea she reads not <i>just</i> my thesis, not <i>just</i> my first two paragraphs but the <b><i>WHILE</i></b> story lol... and what makes it even worse is that I cried. I cried from my own story. I knew what was gonna happen and I <i>still</i> cried at the end... MY OWN story lol... but yea i got a 14/15 which is a 93% which seems to be the highest grade of the kids in my class... I lost points on punctuation lol.... so had SOMA done his job better i would have had a hundred lol.... jk love you soma MUAH </font><font face=""arial narrow"" color=""dodgerblue"" size=""04"">BIG HUG TO SOMA</font><font face=""arial narrow"" color=""dodgerblue"" size=""03"">hehehe anyways I was like tickled to death and like a few people asked me what I got lol and later i thought to myself... 'if u know ur grade isn't that good, why would you ask someone what their grade is knowing they r gonna ask u what urs is back??' its almost like they r trying to embarass themselves.... maybe its just me... and i feel like that's cocky of me to say mostly cuz i'm the one with the good grade but in H.S. when i got a bad grade on something I didn't even mention it like ever... I also think to myself like ""did they think that <i>i</i> would have a lower grade then them??""  cuz in H.S. when there was someone i KNEW would have a lower grade than me i'd ask them what they got just so i wouldnt feel as bad haha... so if that's what they were thinking then <i>why</i>??? a

anyways.... i think that i think too much so im gonna stop thinking.... hehehehe :-)

<b>""Anything But Ordinary""</b>

Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep
It's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast
Just to feel the danger
I wanna scream
It makes me feel alive

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please

To walk within the lines
Would make my life so boring
I want to know that I 
Have been to the extreme
So knock me off my feet
Come on now give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive
 

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rahter be anything but ordinary please.

Let down your defences
Use no common sense
If you look you will see 
that this world is a beautiful 
accident turbulent suculent 
opulent permanent, no way
I wanna taste it 
Don't wanna waste it away

Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh my self to sleep
It's my lullaby

Is it enough?
Is it enough?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please

Is it enough?
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please. -Avril</font> <font face=""arial narrow"" color=""dodgerblue"" size=""03"">

<font face=""arial narrow"" color=""red"" size=""03"">

<b>""Unwanted""</b>

All that I did was walk over
Start off by shaking your hands
That's how it went
I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight
Oh, yeah, yeah
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way 
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away

No, I just don't understand why
you won't talk to me
It's hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you

Make me go away

I tried to belong
It didn't seem wrong
My head aches
Its been so long
I'll write this song
If that's what it take

Make me go away
Make me go away  - Avril Lavigne</font>

So apparently I forgot to tell Jessica that I changed livejournal sites lol... So she posted the BEST southern dialect comment on my old journal... so this is how it goes guys.... go to the old site and check out what she said... its the top entry just cuz i know those fags still check the site... thanx to some insider information... I thought they should see it... ya know... so go <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ladonnathe01"">here</a> and be amused... cuz Jgiz tells ya how it is... Oh guys don't be gay and comment in the old journal and be like ""ladonna so your new journal... blah blah blah"" Cuz we all know the reason I got a new journal was so they'd stop harassing me.... 

Ok So I have this nice big decision to make.... :-\ My daddy was gonna come for parents weekend, but since I wanna go home for thanksgiving he's not gonna come. And my assumption is that if I go home for thanksgiving that the cell phone won't be coming before january either lol... but I'm debating whether I'd rather just stay here for thanksgiving... like if I can last 'til Thanksgiving without seeing my dog and my mom and dad and shit I may as well just wait another month until december right?? I mean its only two more months from now... I need advice... I'm gonna ask soma and everyone has to comment and tell me what they think... ASAP (blackness... heheh)

Anyone who remembers the Richard kraze way back when.... Jessica YOU BETTA REMEMBER... lol Lia should know... but umm I called him last nite on Neil's cell cuz we all know I ain't got one... and well umm lol... He told me to call him back toniute at 8:00 but I'm gonna be at cheerleading and well umm I don't feel like i care to call him anymore... Cuz after a little while you realize what it means when richard walsh tells you to call him at a certain time the next day... in-fact it means: ""I won't <i>mind</i> talking to you tomorrow at that time but right now I'm in bed with someone that you wouldn't approve of, but I prefer not to talk toy ou at all..."" It took me a while to figure that out lol but I got it now... lol jk Soma told me that, but I still don't believe him. I'm not gonna believe him until the day I call and actually hear a chick... To me Shit don't stink 'till I smell it  so there's that.... 

I went the whole weekend without running into Ryan which is FUCKING ROCK you have no idea. So I don't care how uneventful the weekend was it was definitely happy and sucessful :-)

Anyone I gots cheerleading in 90 mins and a shit load of hw so I'll catch u all on the flip-flop... someone tape One Tree Hill for me.... I have study group at 10:30 so I won't be around my room till like midnight.... flip-flop guys....

PS  I GOT MY PRESENT FORM SOMA WHO IS THE WAY KOOLEST to everyone who didn't know already hehehe.... MUAH

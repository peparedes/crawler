"event","Have you ever notices that it is warmer right before the sun rises?

Normally, I wouldn't notice that, but seeing as I'm up at the buttcrack of dawn, I thought maybe I would study it seeing as I'll probebly be up at this time for the next two years or more.  

Have you ever has something eating away at you, and you didn't know what?  Its like an empty feeling inside that you don't really notice until you start to think about it and how it got there.  I used to have that big empty feeling.  Now its much smaller and I barely notice it or care to notice it anymore.  For now, it is as much apart of me as everything else is, and though eventually I will figure out how to repair it, right now it proves to be no real threat.  

In a way, Emilia has saved my heart.  Because of her, I know that I will always be able to love no matter what happens and who breaks it.  It will always beat because now it has a definate purpose.  I'd love to say that all my worries about ending up alone from now until who knows when has been taken care of and no longer exist, however, such thoughts have risen again.  I don't mull over it like I did before until it makes me so miserable that I can hardly breathe.  I have no time for that anymore, and I have to be here for Emma.  However, its like a dull pain and a nagging voice in the back of my mind preaching what I've tried so hard to get rid of.  You're not good enough, you're not interesting enough, if you were anything worth keeping, someone would have kept you.  I hate that little voice.  I have been trying so hard to convince myself otherwise for the past who knows how many months.  

I stand in front of the mirror, and instead of picking things that I hate about my appearance, I pick things that I love.  Like my eye.  One of my eyes has a brown spot in it.  Its unique.  Only I have that eye.  And I think its cool.  There are so many things that I have discovered about myself.  Like, if I am upset, a lot of times I'll lie about it and say I'm not just so people don't worry about me.  I don't like causing other people grief.  I don't like to talk much anymore.  The only time I really talk to anyone is at D & D or church.  And even at Church, I tend to stay quiet, only responding with a couple of words.  I keep to myself, no longer wanting to be the center of attention.  If all eyes are on me, I shy away.  A bit of the butterfly I used to be will come out around friends, but not oftan.  I am just as quick to anger as I was, however I'll actually sit and think about it for a second before I respond, which has been something that I was never good at in the past.  

Some days, I feel so happy that it seems impossible that I could ever be sad again.  I had a straight month and a half of such happiness, but now I know that it does indeed leave for periods of time and in its place hatches worry, and a little anger.  I think...If he stays with me, I want it to be because he wants me and loves me, not because he's afraid of hurting me.  See, I can get over heartbreak.  I have done it before.  That pain is always there in small amounts, but the majority of it goes away and I can breathe and smile again.  I can stand up and try again.  My cousin and an old friend thinks I'm brave (or stupid) for being able to keep trying.  I guess I am the undying inbodyment of hope.  Which sucks sometimes because that hope gets me into pain in the first place.  I will admit that I am scared.  I mean, who the hell isn't?  You'd have to be an idiot not to be scared.  But at least I admit it and go forth in the HOPE that maybe I'll conquer that fear and never have to feel it again.  

-sigh-  I'm done rambling.  Right now, I have to go feed myself before I pass out.  I'm going to talk to my aunt and see about starting to lift weights again.  ^.^ I now have hips!  I'm so excited!  I love my figure in complete now!  I work out just for the sheer joy of lifting something heavy and knowing that somewhere in the world, there is someone who can't lift something as heavy as you.  Like my brother -evil grin-  just kidding.  My favorite excersizes are my abdomen ones and my leg ones.  I love my legs.  I think they are my best feature, so when I work them out and see them improve more to strength, its one of the best feelings in the world.  I lurve it.  Well, off to eat and get ready for church.  

Signing off!"

"event","Well, I am tired.  LOL, very tired.  And my memory is failing.  But I am alive.  

Congratulations Tom and Em.  I am so happy for you.  I wish I could be there when you guys get married, but I have no way to get there and a baby to boot.  ^.^ You guys should have it here instead.  In any case, Congrats and I love you both!  I hope you have a happy life together!  

All is well here.  I took Emma to get her pictures taken today.  Her first pictures.  She slept through all but the last two.  She is absolutely adorable.  Valerie knows.  she saw a kind of bad copy of it that comes on the receipt, but it was good enough to get the basic idea.  She had her eyes open and everything.  ^.^ 

Well, only time for a quick update and let everyone know that I am alive and well."

"event","Its been a little while since I have updated here.  For those of you who don't know already, I had my baby girl last monday at 11:47 p.m.  It was a baby girl, and she is beautiful.  Shes a really good baby too.  She is pretty calm and doesn't cry much.  She makes some of the most adorable expressions too.  However, in the course of a week, I have managed to get a bit of the baby blues.  

I feel horrible today.  I feel terrible that I feel horrible, mainly because I have no reason to feel horrible.  I have a healthy and beautiful baby girl and so much else that makes me happier than I have ever been, but I guess its just that my fears are starting to get to me.  Fears and worries.  Old ones, new ones, stupid unfounded ones.  They are all there and I've managed to think of all of them.  

It really doesn't help that I miss Tyler so much.  He couldn't make it to the birth.  He tried to find a flight, but when its the week of Christmas, its kind of hard to do that.  I just miss him and he has been so busy and tired lately.  I don't know, whenever I get an e-mail or a call from him, I can feel myself become lighter and happier.  He was probebly late this morning or just didn't have time today, or the internet was going all funky, but I really could have used the smile today.  One of the bigger unfounded or stupid worries I've been mulling over would be that I'm scared of losing him.  This is the best relationship I've literally ever had and I'm afraid of losing him.  All my dating life, I have managed to short-change myself.  And the ones that I didn't short change myself on I ended up running away from because it was strange and unfamiliar to me and I didn't want to get hurt.  With those ones, I couldn't understand what in the heck they would be doing with me and I was convinced that at some point they would leave.  That fear is back now and no matter how hard I try to push it away, it still remains one of those old fears.  I know that I trust him and I know that I wouldn't leave him despite that fear because of how right this relationship feels to me.  But its there as one of those stupid, unfounded fears.  I have no reason to fear it, I just do.  When he tells me he loves me or he misses me, its so reassuring.  I know that I'm not becoming too boring for him or that he has not changed his mind about being with me.  otherwise, I feel a little scared.  Everything that has ever seemed so good in my life has ended.  It has always been like that quote written on my cousin's wall;  'If something seems too good to be true, than it probebly is.'  I'm afraid that once again, that quote will be true.  I'm afraid of ending up alone later in life and I'm afraid of failing.  I'm afraid of failing myself, my family, my friends and most of all my daughter.  I'm afraid that if I become too stressed I'll go back to my old habits that I have been working so hard to leave behind, like the smoking.  I'm afraid of the type of person I used to be.  I'm afraid that I'll never be able to get into college and get that degree so that I can teach.  I'm afraid of how much love I feel for my daughter.  I'm afraid of how much I love Tyler and just how much power he does have over me.  I'm afraid of falling and hitting the ground.  You know what I'm really afraid of though?  These stupid baby blues.  I have so many things to be happy about and that I am happy about.  I haven't felt sad like this in a very long time and I'm not used to it anymore.  I hate this feeling when I used to revel in it.  It gave me an excuse to pity myself and write repetative poetry and lyrics about the world ending and all that.  It gave me an excuse to whine and complain about just how much my life sucked and how unfair everything was.  I hate that person.  I've learned to love myself in so many different ways and just how much I am worth, and when I think about it, I know that I hate that person that I used to be.  

So what I am going to do right now, is think of everything I have that makes my life ten times better then it ever has been, take a long bath, watch one of my favorite Disney movies while I cuddle under a blanket with my baby daughter in my arms, and enjoy everything that I have and wouldn't give up for the world.  I'm going to forget my worries and fears now that I have typed them up and left them on a page instead of in my head, and I'm going to have an awsome night and meet everyone and everything with a smile.  It might now be a solution, but it is a start.  Maybe tomorrow I will feel better because of my venting on here.  I guess we all have our bad days and I am no different.  I was overdue for one anyway ^.^"

"event","When I close my eyes I see a whole different world.  Its one that can never be copied onto paper or canves as it is ever-changing.  I love how my mind can wander and see different things.  Sometimes I see 'snapshots'.  My most recent 'snapshot' is me and Emma on a porch, sitting on the cement steps.  We are both wearing these tye-dye shirts and she looks to be about two or three years old.  She is sitting between my legs with her back to me and I'm holding her small hands in mine.  We both have this big smile on our faces.  Our feet are bare and we both have cut-off blue jean shorts on.  The whole scene is so beautiful to me.  Its surreal in a way, something that one could have seen in the 60's.  It looks so happy and I can't help but hope that some day, the 'snapshot' will become real.  Who was holding the camera?  Who were we smiling so avidly for?  Where were we?  Questions that will hopefully have answers at some point.  I can't help but smile at these thoughts.  I can see myself on that same day chasing her around an old tree, her little girlish giggle echoing in the air and encouraging me to 'try and catch' her.  I can already feel the cool grass between my feet and the light I feel within my heart.  Such random beauty, but I can't wait to do all that."

<TD>Your type is known as the Champion type, which is part of the larger group called idealists. Nothing occurs that does not have some deep and ethical significance in your eyes. You see life as an exciting drama. You are very charismatic, yet tend to be too harsh on yourself for not being as genuine as you think you should be. 3% of the population shares your type.<BR>As a romantic partner, you need to talk about what is going on in your life. You are a strong supporter for your partner's efforts to grow and change and be happy. You need to feel that same support from your partner. Expressive, optimistic, and curious, you are eager to enjoy new experiences with your partner, whom you wish to be your confidant and soul mate, as well as play mate. You are uncomfortable sharing negative emotion, though, and tend to withdraw from confrontation and process your feelings privately. You feel most loved when your partner appreciates your creativity, accepts your uniqueness, and sees you as the compassionate person you are. You need to hear your partner tell you how much you mean to them and would love if they did thoughtful spontaneous things to demonstrate it.<BR>Your group summary: <A href=""http://keirsey.com/personality/nf.html"" a>idealists (NF) </A><BR>Your type summary: <A href=""http://keirsey.com/personality/nfep.html"" a>ENFP</A> <BR></TD></TR>

"event","Well another day is nearing it's end and a long day it has been.  I woke up at 6:00 this morning because I had to take that three hour glucose test to make sure I don't have gestational diabetes.  I failed the one hour one.  I couldn't eat anything after midnight and so I was really hungry and the monkey within was starting to protest.  Anyway, So, I got there early and sat for a while.  They called me back, took a blood sample to make sure of my blood level was right, and then sent me out while they processed it.  a half an hour later, they brought me a glucola as they call it, and I had to drink it before five minutes was up.  That stuff is so nasty.  Its really really sweet and it has a nasty aftertaste.  -shudder-  Anyway, so I had to wait an hour after that, they took another blood sample and then let me take up residence for the next two hours in a bed because I was feeling sick and exausted.  I find out the results tomorrow.  

Anyway, so I get home and I'm eating some leftover potato salad from dinner last night, and I had to stop because I was starting to feel sick again.  I stood and walked towards the house, but had to stop and lay down in the grass because I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was horribly shaky and felt really weak.  After trying to gather my wits, I walked as fast as I could to the house before my legs gave out, and laid down for a while in a chair.  Once I was confident enough in my legs not to call for help to get downstairs, I went to my room and tried to take a nap for a couple of hours, but I didn't get very far.  I didn't sleep very well last night.  Luckily, I feel better now.  I just feel like laying around and doing nothing because I'm still a bit tired.  

I made it through another day.  I always knew I would, but I discovered that if I keep myself busy doing something and listening to music, I'm distracted and don't really think about anything.  Stress seems to just fade away for a while.  I'm starting into the compulsive cleaning state again that I was in before working at walmart.  I'm happier when I'm busy.  I seriously never thought I'd say this, but scrubbing counters, sweeping, and looking at the progression in the room that you've been cleaning is very therapeutic in a way.  I decided to make dinner tonight despite the fact that it would probebly be only me and my brother eating.  I made this beanless chili stuff and cornbread.  I had to stop eating it because it was already beginning to give me heartburn, but everything gives me heartburn.  

I've been working on short stories and rants lately.  It also seems to keep my mind from wandering to all the bad things that could happen.  I was reading this pregnancy book, and I guess that most women in their third Trimester start to worry about everything that can go wrong with the baby and just around her in general.  That made me feel better too.  Sometimes I feel so stupid for worrying about the things I worry about all the time even when there is solidity that it is not going to happen.  

Yesterday, we got to listen to Emilia's heartbeat.  It was so funny.  The doctor pushed the thingy-probe-whatever-you-want-to-call-it into my stomach and she kicked it.  And you could hear her kick it!  There was this steady strong hearbeat and then a 'thump' that sounded like someone tapping a microphone.  She did it twice.  I'm really excited to meet her.  Valerie has christened her 'Bug'.  I guess every child needs some strange kind of nickname.  My mom's brothers and my grandmother all called me pumpkin when I was little.  When I turned ten my uncle Larry stopped calling me pumpkin and started calling me little sis.  ^.^ He still calls me little sis.  Those are the only nicknames I've really ever had except for Ella or El-Train.  ^.^ I love Dani for that nickname.  She started calling me El-Train when we went cliff-diving two years ago.  Those were some good times. 

Alot of things happened in the past week that I haven't mentioned yet.  One is actually quite important.  Brandon e-mailed me.  We had a sort of falling out a while back because of my idiocy and he surprised me with an e-mail.  I had been really nervous before I opened it, but we've reconciled and are hoping to become friends again.  I'm really glad for that.  I missed him a great deal.  Our friendship most likely will never be the same as it was before, but that is such with starting over.  I'm just glad that he is giving me another chance.  I feel lucky for that.

I have three Home and Garden parties going on right now.  They are catalog parties and hopefully they will do well.  I've been trying to encourage the hostesses the best I can and answering questions, but I'm very new at this and don't know the ropes yet.  I am learning though.  I have two parties scheduled for november so far, hopefully more will be made.  Eventually, I'm going to call my aunts in Utah after I've saved some money and become a bit more confident in myself and I'm going to go to Utah for a week and do however many parties I can.  I guess Utah is wide open territory ready for whoever wants it.  Depending on how good everything goes, I may end up going down there every month to two months for a week to do whatever parties are booked off of the first ones.  The place has great potential and I need to do the best I can.  So, cross your fingers for me.

Anyway, well, I'm going to skip and try to finish another short story.  I really need to work on my form, wording, and the general idea.  I think that I want to get everything in so badly that I miss out at parts and don't explain things particularly well, therefore leaving the piece seemingly unfinished and insensible.  So, hopefully, I can start to work on that.  Till later."

"event","Okay, Emma is still healthy and strong and all that.  Boy am I glad.  I thought I was paranoid before.  I'm a klutz, and I'm afraid of tripping and banging into something or falling down the stairs...I actually almost fell down the stairs a week ago.  Scared the shit out of me.  My brother and I had just gotten into a fight and he had just got done telling me how much he hated me, so I was leaving the room and going downstairs to calm down.  I tripped on the top stair and fumbled/slid a bit before I could get a grip on the rail, hence saving myself from tumbling down.  I had made a loud noise about it apparently because my brother came running into the dining room asking if I was alright and if Emilia was alright.  He then apologized, I apologized and I was able to catch my breath.  

Having weird dreams still.  The other night I had a dream about craving butterfingers and this little pocketbook/hairless-rabbit was chasing me around trying to bite my legs off because it picked up one of my butterfingers when I dropped it and I took it back.  

Anyway, I'm going to attempt to wake up Valerie, because I have to go get my brother and get some stuff at the store for tonight.  Its my first home and garden party.  I had to quit walmart because it was getting too difficult to  bend over and lift things, and by the time morning came, I was so sore I could barely walk.  I tried to get switched, I even talked to the damn store manager about it, but it didn't work and my mom just told me to quit because it wasn't worth mine or my baby's health.  so I did.  

Signing out for now."

I'll be hungry and fix something to eat, but as soon as I start eating it I can just tell that its not going to settle right and I'm going to pay for eating it later.  >.<  Picky child.  So far, I can eat bread, some kinds of soup, fruit, and precious few other things.  Luckily its enough of a variety for me to still be able to eat healthy, but its just barely that.

"event","Its been a long time, and for that I apologize.  I've been working nights, so I sleep until about 7:00 or so at night and then I spend the rest of the time before work trying to wake up, eat, and get ready.  When I go online, its on my days off and even then sometimes I don't have the brain to write.  

I beleive that I am perminantly stuck in softlines (clothing and apparel,) which isn't too bad, but some of the boxes are quite heavy and a couple of the girls I work with leave everything to the last minute.  Becky is really good and so is Melissa.  Both are hard workers and are interesting to talk too.  But when Norma and Martha work, I seem to get into trouble in the mornings.  I don't when the other two work.  Norma and Martha are the ones who seem to leave everything to the last minute.  They are bound and determined to get EVERYthing onto the floor, even though it is quite impossible unless you stash them places.  We always manage to get the pallets to the back room far to late when they work and being the one who my manager Lori seems to magnitize too in situations like this, I get chewed out because we weren't off the floor on time.  -hits head-  There really is no use in trying to convince them anything.  However, I have a great respect for those two.  They are very hard workers and Norma always has a smile on her face.  However, I feel like Val sometimes when she looks at my eyes and notices the brown dot.  I just want to rip it out.

Anyhow, work isn't too bad.  It has it's ups and downs, good people, and its bad people.  But for the most part, I think the only thing keeping me from liking this job as much as it deserves is the fact that its over night and by lunch, my legs feel like they are about to fall off under my butt.

I got a nose bleed last night.  The second one I've ever had in my life and both have happened during this pregnancy.  A couple people suggested I talk to my doc about it.  Maybe I will.  Its probebly not too important.  

lol -shakes head-  Jack, one thing.  I love you!  You are my comic releif now.  Every time I feel down I picture what you tell me to picture and I laugh all night.  ^.^ It really is a beautiful image, what you have created in my head.  Oh god, sometimes I'll be stocking a rack and it will be so silent, then there it pops up out of the blue.  

Its so weird.  I'm like...half a month away from my third trimester.  Everything is going by so fast!"

"event","By 10 to 30, I mean its ten minutes to 3:30 a.m. at the moment.  To answer the question of why I'm up at 3:30 in the morning is simple.  I'm used to staying up all night and can't sleep whether I want to or not.  So, I'm staying up and wreaking havoc on the cyberworld.  In a while, after I'm updating this journal of course, I'm going to go inside, drink from the milk carton and debate on whether or not I want to kick back in a recliner and watch a movie, or go downstairs and attempt to sleep.  

I ate a cheeseburger earlier.  It tasted like shit.  I haven't eaten fast food in a long time, so thats probebly why it tasted like shit.  ^.^ but oh well.  I went and saw Charlie and the chocolate Factory earlier.  That is such an awsome movie.  ^.^ I liked it just because it was so weird.  Tim Burton is a Genius.  I can't wait to see The Corpse Bride.  

I can't find any good roleplays.  Oh well.  I go in for my ultrasound in...two days.  I'm so excited.  I hope we find out what it is.  I mean, I'm far enough along to be able to tell, but if the baby isn't exactly forthcomming...yeah.  you know what I mean.  I was thinking about going up to Jump Creek for a few hours, but I slept too late into the day.  I used to go there alot.  I haven't been there for a while.  I miss the waterfall so much and how it feels so cool when your next to it despite how hot it is.  I want to sit on my big rock and just stare at the water. 

I'm also sorely tempted to visit the old Pen again, but I doubt I'll go right now.  At some point I just want to go up there so I can see the cork tree and stuff.  Maybe get a piece of it.  -shrug-  dunno.  

Anyway, just wanted to update and make sure everyone knew I was alive.  On another note, This child will be either a great soccer player, or a helluva good boxer.  maybe Karate or something...but either way, this child doesn't sit still very oftan and man does it like to kick!!!"

"event","I am updating!  I've been sick for the past few days. :P  It sucks.  Either I ate something that was bad, or I'm catching that stupid stomach virus thats been going around.  Its been three days and I'm still not 100%.  Anyhow, a few days ago, as I was working on restocking the pharmacy (I hate, HATE mind you, the pharmacy...-grumbles-), I heard a song that I've heard a few times before, but only in the company of Brandon.  I stopped my work and listened to it, and just had to smile.  I think I heard that song every time at least once when I was in his car.  It brought back alot of memories and made me think about how much I miss him, but the old times are gone now and we've gone our seperate ways.  I hope he is okay.

I go in for my first Ultrasound in a week from tomorrow.  I'm really excited, as are alot of people.  I am starting to feel the baby really kick.  You can't feel it on the outside yet, but with the strength of the kick already, it shouldn't be much longer. 

I have decided to tell you all what boy's name I have chosen, overlooking my original qualms in NOT saying anything before.

If the child is indeed a boy, his name will be Lewis Oliver.  I have liked both names for a while, and recently came to find out that I loved them both together.  

Now, the girls name is one I'm keeping to myself -evil grin-  just because I can, and because Em keeps pestering me about it.  :P so there.

Lets see here, Oh yeah!  my friend heather from work has been trying to set me up with guys there >.<  I don't want to go out with anyone there!  I proves to be a distraction and neither of us would be able to perform well enough.  On top of that, its just...I don't want to date right now.  Its not a good time.  So I told her that.  -withering look- She's still doing it.  But I can't escape her, she's my partner in most of the area's I work.

Anyhow, I'm going to go and get some shtuff done.

"event","So...tired...Oh well, I slept in until 2:30 today which is a record for me, and I am debating between asking Valerie over to hang out tonight or watching 'Paint Your Wagon' with Clint Eastwood. One thing is for damn sure, I don't want to do anything and I don't want to see walmart anywhere for the next two days.  I've been working there for three nights and I already feel like I live there.  Of course, thats because I always end up there later before I have to go to work.  Hours before I go to work.  >.<  -sigh-  That problem is that I don't sleep during the day.  I'll take an hour long nap or so and the longest nap I usually take after I say up all night is about 4 hours.  So, I go places, weary myself, then come home and go back to sleep.  

Anyway, I hurt so bad last night that I could barely walk this morning.  It hurt so bad.  But, I calculated the estimated amount on my first paycheck, and believe me...I would rather work during the night and hurt all over then work during the day and get paid minimum wage.  The figures were nice.  Veeerrry nice.  I can't wait.  To comemmorate it,  I'm going to buy $10.00's worth of roses!  maybe even $15.00!  my dried flowers got thrown away :( so I need to dry more.  My room looks weird without drying plants hanging down. 

Anyway, I'm going to go try Val again, talk to Flitwick and Skai, and then sit down and watch a movie since I have the today and tomorrow off.

I just thought I'd update and let y'all know that everything is peachy."

"event","^.^ I found this tape that was the soundtrack to the movie Cocktail, and it had that song on it.  It also had Hippie hippie, tuttifrutti, Kokamo, and...I can't remember what else.  

FLITWICK ATE IN FRONT OF ME!  Okay, so heres whats been happening with Flitwick and Skai.  I bought them this big cage on my birthday so that they wouldn't be so cramped and I could put all their Petco spoilings in with them.  It was going great.  I was getting the cage all set up in its place with food and water, and then It took forever to put the toys and stuff in because I was so compulsive about it.  I think I was doing the whole Feng shui thing because I was moving things all around until it finally felt right.  I do that to my room too. ^.^  I had gotten most of the stuff out of what had been the current cage with the birds still in them, and they didn't move or anything, they scooted out of the way when I got the hoop out, but for the most part they seemed really easy.  

After I got everything set up finally, I bought the old cage and set it on top of the new one so it would be faster getting them it.  I was talking to them for a bit and finally, I attempted to get them into the new cage. >.<  They went flying around in there.  I finally got ahold of Skai, who had finally stood still, and as I was pulling her out, she started struggling, but I finally got her into the cage.  I then moved onto Flitwick, and when I finally got ahold of him, he was biting me and he got away.  His wings are clipped, so he was hopping around on the floor.  I finally got this ingenius idea to use a bandana. I draped it over him and gently scooped him up, then I put him in the cage.  He ruffled his feathers and just stared indignantly at me after that.  However, As I was putting him in, Skai flew out again.  Her wings arent clipped.  So she is flying around back and forth and I'm trying to catch her and calm her down at the same time.  Luckily, she is not a fast flyer.  I implored the use of the bandana once again, and this time, I gently caught her into it, still talking to her mind you.  I only have her half in the bandana, and her head is sticking out, looking around and chirping.  She could have gotten out, I'm surprised she didn't, but she just sat there in my hands as calm as could be, chirping back and forth with Flitwick.

So, I finally get them in there, and as soon as I shut the door, they fly onto one of the perches and start chewing me out loudly.  So...I chewed them out silently in my head and left the room to check my e-mails.  Anyway, that was two days ago, and I've been giving them both space.  I mean, if I come into the room, I'll talk to them and sometimes I'll sit in front of the cage and talk, but for the most part, they don't move at ALL in my presence.  They just stare and back away if I get too close.  But a little while ago, I came in the room, said hello and was going about my business.  They didn't scoot away or anything, and then, Flitwick flew down from his perch, chirped at me, scooted down a bit and started eating in front of me.  This is the first time that either of them have flown around in my presence or jumped of their own accord.  Its the first time either of them as chirped at me, moved down the perch in front of me, and then started eating!  ^.^ I felt so privilaged.  Anyway, I have to go for now, but I might update again later on tonight.  toodles!"

I have this pink skirt and this black hippie shirt and when I wear it, I feel like the most beautiful creature in the world for some reason.  I honestly don't know why.  Maybe it makes me feel more graceful or something.  I don't know.  ^.^  Anyway, its such a nice feeling!"

"event","^.^ Teehee, that sounds like it could be in one of the 'Series of Unfortunate Events' books.  But seriously...I went to Utah and saw my Grandpa in the hospital this past weekend.  We left on Sunday, and we reached the hospital just in time to see him that night before visiting hours ended.  He didn't say anything to me.  He practically ignored me.  He made a point to talk to Brandon and ask all sorts of questions, and then my dad, which I could understand.  But he didn't ask me any questions, or say anything to me.  I had been emotional anyway, and I ended up leaving the room because I couldn't keep from crying any longer.  I've only ever seen my grandfather up on his feet and riding horses and four-wheelers and breaking fouls, and we've always been very close.  I could tell him anything and he'd always be interested.  So, seeing him practically confined to a bed with tubes sewn into him and i.v.'s and that stupid feeding tube, plus the fact that I was practically not there anyway really hurt.  I hated seeing him like that.

After I finally calmed down enough, I was heading back into the room and everyone was leaving.  My dad asked me what was wrong, and I started crying again, you know, those wracking sobs that keep you from breathing?  I hate those!  I felt like such a baby.  I told him what was wrong and he told me that Grandpa probebly didn't know what to say to me.  That just made me feel worse, because I was afraid all of my family would be like that.  I regretted coming, and in past years, I've always been first in the car when we planned to go to Utah.  

But, the next day, I decided to come and visit him again, and my dad took my Grandma to get a handy-cap sticker for the car.  Grandpa asked me what the plan was, being as we were finally alone, and I told him I was keeping my baby.  He then told me that I just made his day and that he was so afraid I was going to do something else.  Then he told me that my Uncle Brett was every bodies half brother and that grandpa had adopted him because Brett's mother wanted to give him up.  Grandpa also adopted Uncle Brett's deceased half-brother, no relation to my Grandpa other then Brett.  He told me it broke his heart to hear stories that I planned on giving it up.  

That talk made MY day.  Grandpa knew exactly why I was keeping my baby and not giving it up for adoption.  He supported me completely on it and told me to never give up no matter how hard it gets.  He told me that I was beautiful for making that descision and I was being trusted with a soul and a life, and that that in itself, is the MOST beautiful thing in the world.  I felt so much better after that. 

Anyway, so we lolligagged around Utah for another day, and then left last night, getting home around 12:47.  It was a very long trip it seemed, but between Mountain Home and Caldwell, everything just flew by.  ^.^ I nodded off.

Anyway, I woke up this morning and decided to clean my room.  I got all of my dirty laundry together and started washing.  I almost have my room clean.  It would have been clean hours ago, but let me tell you where the second part of my title comes in.  

I was doing a load of laundry, and the washer died.  So my dad is looking at it and trying to figure out whats wrong.  Everyone happens to be out of clean clothing just about.  So, Mom comes in and says we were going to sort everything into piles and take it to the laundrimat.  I just got back from 5 hours in a blasted laundrimat and I'M NEVER DOING LAUNDRY AGAIN!!!  not for another week at least. -pouts-  At some point, we had every stinking washer in that building occupied, dryer as well, and then we had to wash a few loads over again because some dog crap brandon was too lazy to clean up in his room got stuck to his dirty clothes and got washed along with it.  DO YOU KNOW HOW DISGUSTING THAT IS? it pissed both of us off.  Anyway, my feet are so swolen.  I was starting to move slow and everything was getting painful, so mom sent me home.  I insisted on staying with her to finish because she wasn't going to leave until everything was folded, but she wouldn't let me.  So I complained about going home for a few minutes, in which case I took a bunch of clothes out of a few of the dryers and started folding them, and she grabbed them from my hand, and told me to go home before I hurt myself and her grandchild.  After which, I frowned at her, said 'fine' in a grumpy voice and attempted to help her carry the finished things out to the car.  >.< She yelled at me and told me to put those clothes down.  

So, I drove home, and now, I'm reclining in a chair writing this long and quite meaningless update before I go in and finish my room.  No matter how tired I am, I have to finish my room tonight or it will never get done.  I have other things to do.  I was going to pick up the rest of the house today too, but that went well >.<

Oh, and to give you an idea of how much laundry we had, We filled 20 washers full of clothing, including 5 double loaders.  it was very VERY bad.  

Anyway, I have a few things to do yet, so I'm going to get.  

Oh, here is a little something I found when I was cleaning my room.  I dont remember how long ago I wrote it though and its not very long.

Mr. Stardust

hello Mr. Stardust
have you come for my dreams?
to melt them together into nothing
and hand them back forever useless?

I wish I could smile too
Wilst I break someone's heart
A smile like yours would be
a fine thing to have.  

Were you a troubled child?
Oh, Mr. Stardust, you must have been
For only someone with such a childhood
could be so sadistic, yet masochistic at the same time.

Well, you have my pity.
Even as you smile, break my heart
and steal my dreams, I know it is
you that is hopeless, not I."

"event","Tonight is when I start staying up all night and going to sleep in the morning.  I'm going to try and take a nap today so I can do this, but its going to be difficult anyway since for some reason, as soon as the first Trimester passed, I had no trouble getting to sleep.  ^.^ I love sleep.  But anyhow, Tomorrow morning, I will go to sleep around 8:00 since that is when I'll probebly get home from work, and see how long I sleep.  Being one of those people who can't sleep with any light, my windows are blocked off and my room is like a second night.  I still have some cracks to plug.  I think maybe I'll sleep for about 4 or 5 hours and then wake up, but after a few days of this different schedule, perhaps I'll sleep longer.  

But right now, I'm not quite awake yet and I need to eat really badly.

Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky

So she took her love
For to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in the fields of gold

Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in the fields of gold
We'll walk in the fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in the fields of gold
When we walked in the fields of gold
When we walked in the fields of gold"

"event","This morning, my mother woke me up saying I had a phonecall.  On the phone was a walmart manager and I had an interview at 1:15 this afternoon.  That was an awsome wake-up call, let me tell you!  But then, I got online and found out that one of my old friends e-mailed me.  I was very excited, but more nervous then ever.  Starting out in an extremely good mood due to the phone call, I read it, and I went from nervousness, to shock, to hurt, to extremely pissed off.  I replied to my old friend, went into the house, took a shower, and went to my interview.

Guess what?  I got a job.  I'm working graveyard shift in apparel.  I get to stock stuff.  I also get to work with Norma.  I like Norma, she's a good person and friend and I've known her since I was in 4th grade.  yay me.  Just wanted to let you all know.  

Man, I'm in a dark mood.  I got the job and I was happy.  But, as soon as I left the walmart parking lot, I was pissed off again.  Part of it was because I had to go and piss in another goddamn plastic cup.  I did that the day before last!  -grr-  I hate peeing in cups.  I'd much rather they drain me of my blood.  I don't mind that and its interesting to watch as it fills the little tube.  (Sorry, but as horrible as it may be, I love going to the doctor to get blood drawn.  its one of my favorite things.  I hate getting shots, but I love it when they draw blood.)  If they had taken blood, that would have put me in a considerably better mood because I think that is one of the coolest things in the world.  But no.  Piss test.  I didn't even have anything to test for!  

Man, I'm starting to get shaky.  I finally quit smoking.  I tried twice before, but I didn't make it.  But I only got through a 2 days.  So far, I'm a week without and still going strong.  And it wasn't because I ran out, because I still have like 7 left from the pack I had.  But, I had cut way down considerably and some days I wouldn't even have one, so I decided to try again.  I'm doing good.  Times like this morning and yesterday when Val and I got into ANOTHER fight (Which was resolved), I really really wanted one.  But I was so proud of myself.  I'm doing really good with that.  I'm not letting myself go over to Vals for a while because of the smoke exposure, so I told her she was going to have to come here.  And seeing as I never really go anywhere else, It really hasn't been as hard as people say.  I mean, I'll have a nic fit, but its gone after I start doing something to keep my mind off of it.  

Anyway, I have to go eat something.  I wonder if I should even waste my time waiting for a reply from my friend?  I doubt it.  He's too pissed off at me.  And I'll admit, it is for good reason.  I just wish he'd get his facts straight or at least tell me what his supposed facts are that way I can correct him on it.  But you know what?  It really doesn't matter.  If he thinks I'm so horrible and not worthy to forgive then whatever relationship isn't worth it.  And you know what?  If thats the case, then I feel really sorry for him because he's going to miss alot of good things.  

Oi, Jack, let me know how your plans with Christina and her birthday are going, or how it went!  I haven't been able to talk to you for a while, we're never on at the right times!"

Unpretty 

T-Boz:
I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you
Look into the mirror who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today (yeah)

Chilli:
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways 
But it's all the same
At the end of the day 
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

Chorus:
T-Boz & Chilli:
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up that Mac can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel so damn unpretty

T-Boz & Chilli:
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm in stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things 
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me (hey)

Chilli:
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through

I have myself to blame
I can't believe I'm trippin'

"event","Man.  You ever just have one of those bad days?  Usually, when I have one of these, I figure out something to do and I go and do it.  But, I'm stuck at my house and I have like no friends, so everything is just ten times more fucked up.  

I went to my first doctors appointment yesterday.  I got to listen to my baby's heartbeat.  ^.^  I'm excited about that.  

But yeah...I need a hug.  And a friend.  it would be nice not to be so lonely all the time.


I'm so Lonesome I could Cry--Johnny Cash

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low:
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud,
To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a Robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost his will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

The silence of a falling star,
Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are,
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
I'm so lonesome I could cry."

"event","Everyone pregnant that I know right now seems to be having early births.  Not by days or a couple weeks, but 6 or 7 weeks.  Whenever I hear then talk about it I am amazed.  The babies are healthy and fighting.  But it worries me.  What if my baby was born that early?  Just thinking about seeing my child in an incubater weighing only just over 4 pounds scares me.  How would I take it?  Probebly not well.  I've already begun to build a strong bond with my unborn child.  I checked up on a calander thing, and my baby is about the size of my stretched out hand.  It has ears, arms, hands, fingers, legs, toes...I can't wait to hear the heartbeat or feel the first kick.  I'm almost 4 months along now, 17 weeks.  23 more weeks.  When you put it into how many weeks are left, it doesn't seem like much at all.  

People are already bringing things over.  One neighbor bought a carseat.  Its not an infant car seat, but its the next size up.  Then, the same day, Vanessa sent some stuff over that her baby has already grown out of.  A basonet, diapers, nursing pads, sheets for the basonet, and a bathing tub. She was talking about sending a swing over too, lol.  

I'm going out to find a job today.  I'm applying at Walmart, and maybe a few other places. I don't know what they are, but a few other places.  Hopefully I'll get on at Walmart as a cashier.  That would be nice.  Then, I can start saving a bit towards baby stuff, help pay insurance, food and the phonebill, and maybe even beauty school.

I've been searching for good schools.  Hairdressers make pretty good money these days and eventually, having that certification can help me get into and pay for college.  
-sigh-  Well, see you all later."

"event","Well, not much of anything happening in my life at the moment.  I got home from Wyoming and had...one friend around here who even wanted to talk to me and that was my cousin.  So, I've been spending alot of time just cleaning the house every day and yelling at my brother for making a mess all over the floor when I just swept.  For those of you who don't know, I despise cleaning, and its getting to the point where I do it to take my mind off of things or calm down or because I'm bored.  And I'm getting eccentric in the way that I do it too.  I clean the same room every day.  During the course of that day, The room (lets say the kitchen) is swept a total of 2-3 times, dishes are done depending on how many there are (its gotten down to 1 load a day), The counters and stove are wiped down 1-3 times a day depending on what was cooked and how big of a mess it made, and the things on the countertops are rearranged about twice a day.  Thats just the kitchen mind you, and thats over the course of one day.  There is still the livingroom, bathroom, and dining room to contend with.  

I also cook alot.  but I don't mind that so much.  The problem with me is I seem to cook double the amount needed...The trip to wyoming really screwed me up.  At dinner time, everyone showed up.  Robert's roustabout crew, a few friends, and then there was Cassie, Me, and the kids.  When alot of people show up for dinner, you get used to cooking alot.  

I finally got a break though.  I finally let myself out of the house and went to work with my mom.  When she went to work, I took the car (even though I'm not supposed to drive) and went and played pool and Rack em.  After a few games in which the cueball went into the pocket more then the rest of the balls, I took myself to a movie then picked my mother up.  Even though I went by myself, I had alot of fun.  It was just nice to get out and meet new people and do something aside from trying to get a kool-aid stain out of the counter-top (which is impossible mind you.)

My birthday is on the 13th.  I turn 18.  Its so funny.  A year ago, I was so excided for this and I was planning things with my friends like camping trips and road trips and all the stuff we wanted to do together before it was too late.  But now that I'm two weeks away, all my friends are off getting ready for college somewhere else, I can't get ahold of them, or they are too far away.  I have my family, but every one works on that day and the days after.  -shrug- no biggie though.  I'll probebly just clean as usual.  After all, the downstairs needs cleaned REALLY bad.  I've been dreading it.  Maybe I'll scrounge up some change and buy a sugar cookie for myself at the gas station. ^.^  Those are so good sometimes!  It all depends on if they are 'fresh' or not.  Or, maybe I can convince my dad to go target shooting or fishing or something.  Just to get out of the house and have a little fun, even if its something as simple as listening to an awsome song on the way to the gas station to get my pink frosted sugar cookie.  

I'm going to try and get a job at Walmart.  Hopefully I can get it.  Then I can buy groceries and we won't have to keep getting food from the church.  Anyway, I have to go.  I'll update sooner then I did this time.  


Jaded--Counting Crows

Happy birthday baby
What's it gonna be
Monday morning' with a hurricane warning'
Oh well, I guess you've got yourself to please
Jaded. Faded.
I don't wanna be afraid.
Jaded. I hate it.
I don't wanna be your slave.
Saw you peeking' round my garden gate
I thought you'd liked what you'd seen
So I said, ""Darlin' if you want a little of these peaches,
just come on and shake my tree.""
Jaded. Faded.
I don't wanna be your slave.
Jaded. I hate it.
I don't wanna be afraid.
Every waking' hour
We break down in different combinations.
We spin around in smaller constellations.
Took a ride on the love wheel
Scary, scary go-round and around.
Honey, Honey I don't want none of your money.
I just want off before we hit the ground.
Jaded. Faded.
I don't wanna be your friend.
Jaded. I hate it.
I don't wanna be your slave.
Saw you hangin' around the avenue baby
So I got down outta my tree.
I think I need a little animal honey.
Come on and shake a little monkey with me.
Jaded. Faded.
Oh. I don't wanna be afraid.
Jaded. I hate it.
I don't wanna be your slave
Every waking' hour
We break down in smaller combinations.
We spin around in different constellations.
Wanna be right there to carry you away
Knowing that our love will last through the day.
It's the same thing.
Gonna be here on the light, on the light
I wanna see me, see me going away
I've been gone such a long time.
Leaving' again today.
Leaving' someday."

Your embrace is as dead as a corpse's. You've been<br>hurt continuous times that you can't see the<br>light any longer. You just want to reach out to<br>people, but you're trapped in that little black<br>box and can't escape... You need help from<br>humans; but instead you rely on your dreams and<br>salvation to hold grasp onto this spinning<br>world... People care about you, you just<br>haven't realized it yet. You fall off the<br>cliff, hoping to die, but instead youre<br>spreading your wings and finding that you can<br>fly... :) Smile a little more, frowning never<br>looked that great on a person anyway. Take<br>everything you've been blessed with, enjoy your<br>life a little more! A hug means many things:<br>love, hurt, anger, celebration, kindness,<br>support, and thank you... In this case, it<br>means hurt and despair... You fall so you can<br>learn to pick yourself up again; spread your<br>wings and fly... Even if it's only to your<br>dreams, dreams are the most powerful thing in<br>the world ^-^

I'm three months along now, I have my first appointment on the 3rd, and I have one friend that I am in contact with!  Val!  My friend, sister, and cousin!  -sigh-  everyone else I can't get ahold of because the phone number is different, or they aren't answering the phone, or email...I dunno.  I've been a bit Lonely and bored lately, but its all good.  I'VE BEEN HAVING SOME DAMN NICE DREAMS!    They are so cool!  They are all kinda set as if in a fantasy book, and some of them even have nicely detailed intimate scenes...The one I had last night!  IT WAS COOL!  I really want to tell Valerie, but since SHE ISN'T ANSWERING HER PHONE AGAIN...she'll have to wait on the details.  And its a dream I knew you'd love to hear about too...-sighs and shakes head-  such a pity, that.  Anyway...so I'm home!  call me or something those that read my journal."

My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams
20 bucks should get me through the week
Never said a word of discontentment
Fought it a thousand times but now
I'm leaving home

Here in the shadows 
I'm safe
I'm free 
I've nowhere else to go but
I cannot stay where I don't belong

Two months pass by and it's getting cold
I know I'm not lost 
I am just alone
But I won't cry
I won't give up
I can't go back now
Waking up is knowing who you really are

Here in the shadows 
I'm safe
I'm free 
I've nowhere else to go but
I cannot stay where I don't belong

Here in the shadows 
I'm safe
I'm free 
I've nowhere else to go but

Show me the shadow where true meaning lies
So much more dismay in empty eyes"

I got chased by some bees, almost killed myself on an extremely precarious bridge to a dock, and almost fell down a hill with lots of sharp rocks.  But I didn't fall. ^.^  I also think I ate way too much potato salad.  bleh...-hits head-  But all is well.  It was a very pleasant day and i just relaxed for the most part.  

I pushed Val into the lake and won half of $50.00!  We split it because she went into the water and all I did was push.  I wanted to go into the water, but she refused adamently and was going on about how I could take myself and the baby into shock, or something. -sighs-  As if I haven't waded into cold water before.  But I guess is wasn't really wading...I would have been pushed head first...-shrugs-  anyway.  Pizza is here, so I have to go.

"event","Lets see here....Haven't updated for a few days.  Went to see star wars and Constantine w/ Brandon.  That was so much fun!  The movie was awsome!  I ate nachos.

The next day, we went to Jump creek and climbed around, attempted to go swimming, and ended up sitting on assorted rocks with eachother.  ^.^ It was great.  I'm really happy I met him.  I'm alot happier.

I came to a conclusion yesterday.  everyone who reads my journal knows about this, but in January, I'm gonna be a mommy.  I've been depressing about it because I suddenly have all these descisions to make and it feels like I'm being pressured into so many things at once.  Whether I am to place the baby in an adoptive home or whether I'm gonna keep it.  I need to get a job and I'm worrying over college.  But I've come to the conclusion that I'me just going to take one step at a time.  I've started a little book, almost like a journal.  Its going to keep track of all the firsts; cravings, sickness, the movements, ultrasounds, all that.  Then, when the baby is born, if I place, I'll have something to keep with me that I can give to the child later on in life.  If I keep the baby, then its something to go in the memory box.  I have decided to make the best out of a bad situation and look at this as a chance instead of a mistake.  When I decided all of this, it seemed as if a weight was lifted and I'm a bit happier.  Other then this situation, I really had nothing else to be unhappy about.  So now that I have that somewhat settled, I can be happier.  

Anyhow, I can't wait to see Brandon again.  I'm excited to spend more time with him.

Right now, though, I have to get going.  I have to go home, eat something, and figure out whats going on my senior table for the thingamajig tomorrow.

oh, and I LOVE THIS SONG!  ITS SO SAD BUT I LOVE IT!!!  

When I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice

I can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
Now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says"

"event","My My My...time passes so slowly, yet so quickly. Already, it is the last week of school for my peers.  I can't help but feel a sort of regret for not buckling down during highschool.  I would have loved running down the hall screaming and pushing the school bell.  I would have loved going to San Fransisco with the select choir I was in.  I would have loved to walk down that aisle with my peers and accept that scrap of paper that I had been working for for twelve years (you know what they say:  Twelve years of hell for a peice of paper and a handshake).  But it would have been worth it.  To run around in a stupid rented gown and take pictures of people I would see less and less of over the spanse of five years.  It would have been worth it to hear ""Schools out forever"" over the intercom one last time when the aides took over the office and the intercom.  It would have been worth all the time I had spent actually attempting to study just to see the proud looks on the faces of my teachers and family.  To say that I finally made it.  I had finally reached my goal.  It would have been so worth it.

But I don't have that.  Sure I have a graduation ceremony at TVCC, but its just not the same.  I'll be graduating with people I haven't known but for a month tops.  For some reason, even though I'm glad I got my G.E.D., I feel this sense of disapointment in myself.  This self loathing that I couldn't even stick it out for a whole four years, even if it was just to say that I actually did it.  I get to walk with strangers.  I was so excited when I got it, but now, its seems so distant and I'm all but lost and without a sense of security.  I've lost a part of myself that I can never get back.  I've lost alot that I can never get back.  I can honestly say, that if I could change one thing, it would be that could have paid more attention and actually stayed in school.  I would have done my Sophomore year over again.  I would have been careful not to get caught up in all the shit that I had done.  I would have saved myself alot of greif, guilt, and shame.  I never thought I would say that I miss the stuff I got from highschool.  But I do, and it saddens me.  You can never go back, they say.  And you can't.  I wish I could, but I can't.  I'm caught in the descisions I made, and that that I thought would never catch up to me, finally has.  I'm paying for my mistakes in full now.  Every last one of them.  

Sometimes, I feel like I just want to break down, stop caring, never leave the house.  I think thats why I'm never home.  Because if I stay there, I feel it will consume me and I'll do what I fear the most.  I hate crying, but lately, I've been doing it alot.  I guess tears are poison, and one could get sick if they don't cry.  I heard that was a scientific fact.  If thats true, why do I feel sick inside?  Why can't I just cry all of it out and let it get better?  Does it ever get better?  The hope in me is starting to leave and be replaced by logic.  Not all the time, but alot of the time.  But no matter how much I logic, there is no answer.  I was told to follow my heart.  Do I even have one anymore?  Sometimes, I know I do and I'm just being too hard on myself.  But other times, I wonder where it has gone.

I'm one prone to self-pity and depression.  One of those who falls into a hole easily, and has no energy to climb out, so they mull about it and not try to solve the problem at hand.  I get so caught up in my reading that I wish for something that doesn't exist, and never will.  I suppose its my own form of torture.  As is roleplay.  I love it, yet its my death.  I roleplay to become another person.  To forget who I am and become wrapped up in a seemingly endless story.  To become and be apart of something I so dearly want.  

I read to get away from my problems and imagine myself in a characters position.  I'm strange that way.  I'm fascinated by other points of view. I absorbe like a sponge.  I've always been observant, according to my mom, which is why I know answers to questions most people would have to search books for.  I see alot of things and keep them in my memory as if my life depended on it.

Maybe thats it.  Maybe I'm doomed to be alone all my life and do nothing but read or write myself insane.  Then I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have the rest of the crack-pots in the assylum to keep me company.  

But then again, maybe there is hope.  Its a dim light, but its there.  Man, I need help."

We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you

Sometimes I need some time...on my 
own Sometimes I need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ohhh yeahhh
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain


Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one"

NO RAIN

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
and speak my point of view
But it's not sane, It's not sane

I just want some one to say to me
I'll always be there when you wake
Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
escape......escape......escape......

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
ya don't like my point of view
ya think I'm insane
Its not sane......it's not sane.

All I can say you know my life it's pretty plain
And all that I can do, is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
No it's not sane
It's not sane

And I don't understand why I sleep all God damn day
All that I do, is read a book to stay awake
It rips my life away
And it rips my life away
And it will rip your life away

"event","What is going on?  Valerie!?  I did tell you about this!  Why are you being so rude about everything?  Brandon is one of my good friends.  No I haven't known him for very long, but he has made his intentions quite clear!  If you do anything, just trust me.  I've lost a whole bunch of friends over these past couple of weeks and I'm down to about four.  You, your mom, Brandon, and Heather.  Everyone else seemed to have abandoned me when I needed them the most.  Brandon and I don't have a romantic relationship.  There is the potential, I think, but right now some things have to be sorted out and said and it will be sorted out and said very soon.  I'm not sure how things will end up after, but things will be out in the open.

I appreciate your protectiveness, and god knows, I need it, but for once, I'm not rushing into anything.  I'm being openminded about alot of things and I'd like to be given the chance to make the right descision for once.  When that descision is made, please trust me with it."

"event","What is life?  Is it a gift, or nothing more then an endless string of seconds tracked and/or wasted?  Is it something that can be bought?  Is it something that can be saved?  Can life be geneticly altered or transformed to fit the human status and prolong mortality?  Or is the enevitable breaking point right around the bend? So many sciences have been born in the hopes to create a sort of immortality.  Stem-cell research.  Genetic Alteration.  Disease analysis.  Chemicals and elixers that hold the secret to the so-called 'Fountain of Youth.' Cloning.  Are we at the pivotal point where we all decide who can play the higher power?  Who is stronger, who is smarter?  Who can create, save, and end life at will?  Who will be the leader, and who will play 'Simon Says'?  The human race is like sheep.  They hear the food bell or the sound of the truck, and they come running to their shepard; Their leader.  In this comparison, Food is to sheep as life is to humans.  They hear the sounds of life and run to it.  Almost everyone wants to life at least another second. minute. day.  They didn't live enough during their time or they are simply afraid to die.  They fear what might come next.  Is it judgement or is it a vast abyss that we all dissapear into?  As you can see it has come to my attention that the people of this world are toying with something that is dangerous.  We are toying with life and death. The consiquence of all this may be less appealing when it is brought to attention.  However, this research has its finer points.  For those who are sick, there is a chance that certain things could be done to prolong life and cure the ailment, thus giving the burdened person an actual chance to live!  By going in a geneticly altering someone who was born with a nuerological disorder or a heretitary disease, they too will be given a chance.  But either way, for good or bad, if the person is supposed to die and a certain point, they will die.  Its called a biological clock, and it's batteries will die no matter how many times you attempt to recharge them.  

Love.  What is love? Who knows what love is.  For all we know, it is a chemical that the brain sends through-out the body in the blood system.  The heart is the main HQ for the blood, and that would explain why when we feel love, we feel it in our heart.  All feelings are are chemical reactions, negative or positive, but reactions none the less.  Certain chemicals in our body are highly addictive, which is why when we are away from someone that we love, we miss them and want to be around them so badly that it sometimes hurts.  Yet another chemical reaction.

And last but not least, Happiness.  What is happiness for you?  For those of you reading this, answer.  

What is happiness for you?

Happiness is best left unrationalized.  Love may be too.  However, in a world that is being taken over by science, pretty soon, we will all have to get used to deciphering crazy talk."

"event","last night, I got called by a couple of people.  Damon finally called, and much to my dismay, I found out that he's not going to be over here for a few more years :(  Damon has been one of my best guyfriends for about 4 years.  He had always been there for me and he told me countless times that i was his best and only friend he just got back from cali on a deka trip or some shit like that.  something for smart people.  I dunno.  

Remember Zack?  yeah, he called to.  He enlisted in the marines and he had been trying to get ahold of me for the past three days.  that was interesting.  He's been humbled.  He doesn't talk about himself much anymore which is good, because I can get a word in edgewise.  

Anyhow, there are rumors flying around at my old school -evil grin-  I'm going to have fun with this.  When I was there, one of my favorite past times was to push buttons and conduct experiments to determine the IQ of the school as a whole.  You could say that I secretly thought of them as labrats.  As horrible as it may sound, it seemed that that was all most of them were worthy of being nicknamed.  

But yeah, I have to call Brandon and see when he gets his next day off.  that and I am just going through withdrawls from his voice.  I PINE!!! ;) -evil cackle-  You know you liked that, Brandon!  mwahahahaaaaa!!!

Well, I have to go cater to my addiction for roleplaying and reading, so I'm gonna scram"

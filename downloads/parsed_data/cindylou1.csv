<TD><FONT size=-2>This test measured 3 variables. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=red>First, this test measured how <B>organized</B> you are. Some muppets like Cookie Monster make big messes, while others like Bert are quite anal about things being clean. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue>Second, this test measured if you prefer a <B>concrete</B> or an <B>abstract</B> viewpoint. For the purposes of this test, concrete people are considered to gravitate more to <I>mathematical and logical approaches</I>, whereas abstract people are more the <I>dreamers and artistic type.</I></FONT>
<P><FONT color=green>Third, this test measured if you are more of an <B>introvert</B> or an <B>extrovert.</B> By definition, an introvert concentrates more on herself and an extrovert focuses more on others. In this test an introvert was somebody that either tends to spend more time alone or thinks more about herself. </FONT>
<P>You are <B>mostly</B> organized, <B>more </B>abstract, and <B>both </B>introverted and extroverted.
<P>Most people either love or hate Elmo. I hope you love Elmo, because that's who you are.
<P><FONT color=purple>You are both somewhat organized. You have a good idea where you put things and you probably keep your place reasonably clean. You aren't totally obsessed with neatness though. Elmo has the same basic approach. His place is pretty tidy, but he doesn't spend all of his time cleaning it up.<BR><BR>You both are abstract thinkers. You definitely are not afraid to take chances in life. You only live once. You may notice others around you playing it safe, but you are more concerned with not compromising your desires, and getting everything you can out of life. This is a very romantic approach to life, but hopefully you are also grounded enough to get by. Elmo's whole life is based on fantasy and his imagination. In the beginning he was a regular character, but now he spends most of his time in this fantasy world. <BR><BR>You are both somewhat extroverts. Like Elmo, you probably like to have some time to yourself, but you do appreciate spending time with your friends, and you aren't scared of social situations. Elmo spends some of his time with real friends, but he also needs some time just to chat it up with his goldfish.</FONT>

ok, this last quiz really quite annoys be because i think it begins with the assumption that faith and reason and science and spirituality are polar opposites, which i certainly don't think is always true...i don't like the way the chart is laid out.  ok, that's all...i just found that a bit irritating, haha."

"event","so i am sitting here in the library, procrastinating from doing work, shocker.  but i am having a difficult time trying to piece together how i am going to write this ramsey/yoder paper.  like in my head, i think i have a good argument, but trying to find the actual evidence to back it up using the two sources that we are supposed to use is tricky...like my argument is based more on several other yoder books, in addition to the one we are supposed to be using primarily.  so trying to actually find a way to structure my paper with good evidence is proving challenging at the moment, even though i know the argument is a solid one.  so the question we are supposed to be answering is, 'using ramsey, how does yoder get just war wrong?'  and what i want to argue is that for ramsey, yoder's account of just war comes across as wrong because of their differing christologies.  because of how they understand the work of christ, their views of the world and church are different, and therefore effect the way in which they understand the just war tradition.  i want to argue that yoder, who thinks in terms of a realized eschatology (because of his christology) cannot give the best account of just war because it does not fit in to his understanding of the witness of the church- but ramsey's understanding of just war as an account of statecraft works much more readily within his framework of the doctrine of two kingdoms, and that is how just war is meant to be understood.  this kind of ties back into what i wrote in my dissertation about how eschatology plays a large part in determining how one approaches the question of war.  so yeah...my thoughts are still sort of all over the place, i am having trouble articulating what i mean, and i can't find good passages out of my 2 main sources to back me up....grrr.  i am just getting annoyed now."

"event","so i am sitting here in the library and i really should be doing work, but i just can't find the motivation at the moment.  though i think i have figured out my schedule for next semester:
monday- no classes
tuesday- new testament (nt) 9-9:50; spiritual formation group 10-10:50; modern european christianity (mec) 11-12:15; the anglican tradition 4-6:30
wednesday- nt 9-9:50; old testament (ot) 11-12:15
thursday- nt 9-9:50; mec 11-12:15; mec precept 1:30-2:20
friday- ot precept 9-9:50; nt precept 10-10:50; ot 11-12:15

so this is quite similar to the schedule i have now, except my evening class on tuesday is a lot earlier and i have an added precept on thursday afternoon....but this means i will be able to keep pretty much the same work schedule, and tuesday won't be as long of a day as it is now where i am on campus from 8am til 9:30pm.

anyway.  so right now i am sitting here with the hopes of getting work done, but i doubt much will come of that.  i am waiting for michelle to get out of class at 5 and then we are going shopping because she needs some winter clothes (she is from florida and is a bit underprepared for nc, which i think is funny since nc doesn't really get that bad in the winter, haha).  though i am feeling pretty good about my work though for this week...it is just the work for the coming weeks that i am starting to get concerned about.  hauerwas just assigned us a paper due in a couple of weeks last night and i have absolutely no idea how i am going to answer the question he is asking us to write about...i really need to sit down and go through what we have read so far and think about that.  and then i need to start thinking about my exegesis paper for old testament...i mean, it isn't due til after thanksgiving, but i don't even know what passage i am exegeting yet.  and then the normal workload, plus 2 more papers for church history, a couple more papers for holy spirit, and whatever else i am forgetting off the top of my head, it is going to be busy...oh yeah, and studying for finals....that will be a big undertaking because we have gotten so much information this semester, especially in church history.  ok, i am done thinking about this stuff for now though.

i am glad it is almost the weekend (haha, i like how i consider wednesday afternoon almost the weekend) but this weekend should be fun.  friday night graham is coming with me to the hurricanes/flyers game...i am really looking forward to getting to see some hockey again!  i love it!  and then saturday sarah invited me out with a bunch of her friends to some sort of haunted corn maze...which doesn't thrill me all that much in and of itself, but i am looking forward to hanging out with people.  ok, well since i am, after all, sitting here in the library i should probably at least try to make some effort to do work....so i guess i am going to get to that at least for a little bit."

2. i love my war in the christian tradition class...we had the best discussion tonight in preceptorial.  seriously.

3. i got coldplay tickets tonight so mike and i are going to see them in charlotte on friday.  how excited am i?

4. i had one of those moments during the vigil we were having today to remember a murder victim in durham, bobby perry, where i realized how lucky i am, how much the world hurts, and how real the presense of god is.  all on one short moment.  so i don't know if that was necessarily a good thing as in, oh, it was happy...but good in the sense that it is those moments that helps shape me and guide me because most of my life is lived in between those moments of clarity."

"event","yay, i am 23 today!  anyway, today actually wasn't all that exciting or out of the ordinary considering i had to be at orientation all day.  and it was rather boring.  i mean, i am excited about being at duke and think this is going to be a very good experience, but i am not too fond of sitting for hours on end listening to lots of people give me lots of information that isn't necessarily completely vital to me at this particular moment.  oh well.  yesterday we got to register for classes.  this semester i will be taking an old testament class (required), medeival church history (also required), the holy spirit and ministry, and war in the christian tradition.  i am particularly excited about this last class considering it was pretty much my dissertation topic.  and as sick as i was of actually writing my dissertation, the topic still totally fascinates me.  and that class is with hauerwas so i am excited about that too.  i made my first official friend today at duke as well...michelle.  she is very nice, just moved up here from tampa.  anyway, we hung out all evening...first she came back with me over to my apartment, then we ended up back at her town house eating pizza and watching a movie.  then her fiance got into town so i met him too.  they are getting married in december and he is moving up here then.  oh, so i bought my books today...or almost all of them...$324...ack.  fortunately, the bookstore here lets you open up a charge account, so you can charge your books with no interest, and as long as you pay it off before next semester, you are good.  so thank goodness for that!  otherwise i would have been screwed because i wouldn't have been able to afford more than a third of my books right now.  anyway, tomorrow is the last day of orientation, thank goodness.  and then tomorrow night mike is coming over again and we are watching fight club since i still have never seen it (i'm not sure how i haven't seen it yet...it seems like such a me movie) but yeah, overall i am feeling pretty good about life in general...a way i definitely haven't felt for a while.  i really have the feeling that duke is the right place for me.  among the people that are attending there are a wide range of beliefs and backgrounds religiously, and i think that is a very good thing because there will be more debate and discussion and it will help all of us to grow.  michelle and i were having this conversation earlier about how much more fun it is when you are surrounded by people that think differently from you (she and i being case in point) and that being in a place where everyone is the same doesn't challenge you or stretch you in ways that being among the people at duke might.  so i am excited.  and tired.  so i think i am going to go to bed now.  happy birthday to me 0:-)"

"event","omg i seriously have no motivation to finish my dissertation.  i mostly just sit here and stare dumbly at my computer screen.  it is almost done though...almost there.  ugh.

so last night i hung out with ken and people in burlington and went bowling, which was fun.  and i had cookout. mmmmm.  then today i had a dr's appointment and ran a couple of errands....i got a couple of candle sconces for the wall in my living room and put them up...they each hold 3 tea light candles and i have them lit now.  i think they look nice.  at the moment i am sitting here, doing minimal amounts of work on the dissertation while watching bring it on.  this movie never ceases to amuse me.  it always reminds me of elon though because i went to go see it my first week as a freshman with a group of people on my hall.

speaking of elon, but going off on completely different subject i haven't gone off on for quite a while...sam.  so i still have had absolutely no contact with him since that day a couple of months ago when i told him i couldn't have him as any part of my life anymore and haven't even thought about him all that much, or at least if i have it has been as a passing thought.  but it is like now that i am back in the area he has been on my mind a bit more.  not in the sense that i miss him or still want him or anything...(well, i mean, i still have those moments, but they pass) but more in the sense that i am terrified of running into him somewhere.  like i am totally worried that i will run into him at homecoming or something and don't think i would react in a very good way.  like if i saw him to talk to him i would probably be able to give off the appearance of being fine, but just the thought of seeing him gives me this sinking feeling in my stomach...like i know i would be really upset and would probably lose the battle in fighting off a major urge to cry.  but all this thinking is making me wonder if i am less over sam than i thought.  i mean, i am over him to the point where i don't particularly want to date him again but perhaps not to the point where i would be alright seeing him or where i think i could have serious feelings about someone else.  which kind of annoys me.  i guess it is almost like i am still wondering whether or not i will ever be able to have feelings for someone in the future like the ones i had for sam. but anyway.  i am just really freaked out by the possibility of running into him, slim though it is.  at least i knew when i was in scotland that there was absolutely no chance of that happening.  now that i am back in the area, there is actually a possibility, especially if i hang out with people in burlington.  but yeah...a part of me almost wants to not go to homecoming for fear of seeing him.  but that is a stupid reason not to go.  yes, the chances of running into him are much greater, but i will be around friends and it would be a shame to miss out of fun stuff just because i am worried about something that could happen.  ok, well enough on that.  i need to just stop thinking about it/him.  i am sure he probably doesn't think about me much, if at all and i would like it if that could be the same for me.

so my birthday is a week from today....23.  that is officially mid-twenties.  crazy.  if anyone wants to know, i am accepting gifts.  and personal checks ;-) or perhaps just a ""happy birthday"" will do.

alright, i guess that is enough procrastinating for now."

"event","ugh, i can't sleep... i woke up at like 1:45 and haven't been able to go back to sleep.  i thought perhaps if i watched boring infomercials on tv i would fall asleep, but that didn't work.  so then i thought, well, maybe if i take a nice warm bath.  but that didn't work either.  so now i have just given up and am out in the living room listening to bbc radio 4 via the internet.  that is one thing i definitely miss about the uk.  i mean, i like npr here, but bbc radio 4 is a million times better.  much better and varied programming.  now i am listening to the broadcast from earlier today of women's hour with jenny murray...ah, i listened to that every morning.  thank goodness i can still listen over the internet!  but seriously...npr should take a cue from the bbc.

so orientation for duke starts a week from tomorrow, yay!  i am excited to get started with things.  today owen and joyce got back from the mountains (they are my landlords) and the had me over for dinner along with jesus (as in hey-zeus) and carla (jesus is a spanish philosopher who is over here for a bit...owen, who is the chair of the philosophy department at duke is his mentor) and we had barbeque....mmmm.  but yeah, i think living here is going to be good.  owen and joyce are quite cool...i haven't met their daughter kate yet, but she is a senior at chapel hill, and i met ben on friday when i was moving in...he is 24 and in a band....he seems like a cool person, someone i would see myself being friends with.  but he headed back to california on saturday or something.  oh, but get this.  so owen is very into eastern philosophy and he is friends with the dalai lama.  i think that is pretty cool.

ok, well i guess maybe i should actually try to go to sleep again since i have to get up at a reasonable time to do more work on my dissertation tomorrow....of course, i could probably use this opportunity of being awake to work on it, and in fact that would probably do a good job of putting me to sleep, but i just can't be arsed to do it right now."

"event","well, i got back home on wednesday...and might i just say, though this trip was certainly still long (3 flights) it was the easiest/smoothest journey i have had either to or from scotland.  so anyway, by the time i finally walked in my door it was sometime after 2 am and i had been awake/traveling for about 24 hours.  so clearly thursday i wasn't much good for anything.  i haven't done all that much since i have been home...my body is still sort of on british time i think...i have been going to bed pretty early and waking up quite early too.  i played a couple of rounds of golf with my dad...shot an 86 on friday...my game wasn't that on....but today i played rather well and shot a 78, so that was good.  it is nice to know that i can still play well even when i am really out of practice.  tomorrow i need to get back to work on my dissertation since i haven't even looked at it in like a week.  ugh.  but i think in the morning my mom and i are going to bed bath and beyond so i can get a couple of things for my apartment (ie. a shoe rack, body pillow, towels and whatever else i realize i don't have) so that will be fun....i loooove bed bath and beyond haha.  but yeah...my goal for this week is to get a good bit done on my dissertation because on friday i am heading up to maryland to do volunteer for a week of camp so i will be gone til the following sunday.  then i come back, then eliza comes down for a couple of days, and then it is time to move into my apartment...so things will be busy for the next couple of weeks.  which is good.  i much prefer to be busy than not.  i get bored otherwise.  so yeah, i don't have anything that is too exciting to say right now, just yay for being home!  oh, but might i just say, holy crap it is hot here....i have been totally melting ever since i got off the plane!  i think it will take a little bit of time for my body to readjust to the weather back here.  right.  that's all for now."

Revocation of the Independance of America

To the citizens of the United States of America, in the light of your failure to elect a competent President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical
duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except
Utah, which she does not fancy.

Your new Prime Minister (The Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America without the need for further elections.

Congress and the Senate will be disbanded. A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed. To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then look up ""aluminium."" Check the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour'; skipping the letter 'U' is nothing more than laziness on your part. Likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters. You will end your love affair with the letter 'Z' (pronounced 'zed' not 'zee') and the suffix ""ize"" will be replaced by the suffix ""ise."" You will learn that the suffix 'burgh' is pronounced 'burra' e.g. Edinburgh. You are welcome to re-spell Pittsburgh as 'Pittsberg' if you can't cope with correct pronunciation.

Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary."" Using the same thirty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""uhh"", ""like"", and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed."" There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you shouldn't have chat shows. Then you learn to develop your vocabulary, and then you won't have to use bad language as often.

2. There is no such thing as ""US English."" We will let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of ""-ize.""

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). You will also have to learn how to understand regional accents --- Scottish dramas such as ""Taggart"" will no longer be broadcast with subtitles. While we're talking about regions, you must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is ""Devon."" If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become ""shires"" e.g. Texasshire, Floridashire, Louisianashire.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good guys. Hollywood will be required to cast English actors to play English characters. British sit-coms such as ""Men Behaving Badly"" or ""Red Dwarf"" will not be re-cast and watered down for a wishy-washy American audience who can't cope with the humour of occasional political incorrectness.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get confused and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American ""football."" There is only one kind of football. What you refer to as American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may have noticed that no one else plays ""American"" football. You will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It is a difficult game. Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full Kevlar body armour like nancies. We are hoping to get together at least a US Rugby sevens side by 2010.


You should stop playing baseball. It is not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America. Since only 2.15% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called ""rounders,"" which is baseball without fancy team strip, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs.

7. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because we don't believe you are sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you will require a permit if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.

8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 2nd will be a new national holiday, but only in England. It will be called ""Indecisive Day.""

9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap, and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts. You will start driving on the left with immediate effect. At the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour.

10. You will learn to make real chips. Those things you call 'French fries' are not real chips. Fries aren't even French, they are Belgian. Though 97.85% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called ""crisps."" Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat. Waitresses will be trained to be more aggressive with customers.

11. As a sign of penance 5 grams of sea salt per cup will be added to all tea made within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this quantity to be doubled for tea made within the city of Boston itself.

12. The cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling ""beer"" is not actually beer at all, it is lager. From November 1st only proper British Bitter will be referred to as ""beer,"" and European brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as ""Lager."" The substances formerly known as ""American Beer"" will henceforth be referred to as ""Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine,"" with the exception of the product of the American Budweiser company whose product will be referred to as ""Weak Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine."" This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in the Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion.

13. From November 10th the UK will harmonise petrol (or ""gasoline,"" as you will be permitted to keep calling it until April 1st 2006) prices with the former USA. The UK will harmonise its prices to those of the former USA and the Former USA will, in return, adopt UK petrol price (roughly $6/US gallon -- get used to it).

14. You will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers or therapists. The fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent. Guns should only be handled by adults. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, then you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.

15. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.

16. Tax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776).

Thank you for your co-operation."

I wish you all could have been there!  It was so awesome!  I don't think there was a dry eye in the chapel when we had the family ceremony and Bri, Robert and I exchanged rings.  And you gotta love a wedding when the Pastor says to the best man ""Frodo Baggins, the rings please"".  I will write more later.  RL is still a tad hectic and I can't go online at my new job.  

Love to you all!  I miss you all as well.  *HUGS*"

"event","Hey all!!  Thank you so much for all of the congrats and well wishes.  You don't even know how much I appreciate them.  Even though I haven't responded to anyone, I have read your entries.  I have been up to my ears in wedding plans.  I am so happy!  Robert truely is everythng I have ever wanted and more.  6 MORE DAYS UNTIL I AM MRS. ROBERT TORRES!!!!!!!!!

OK, I know this is strange.  But our wedding ceremony is going to be http://www.wisconsinmemorialpark.com/about.shtml.  Look at the second picture.  It's called the chapel of chimes.  Yes, it is a cemetary but it is so beautiful.  AND, they want to do a press release on the wedding.  I will post if they do.  

http://www.foodspot.com/loafandjug/brookfield/picturegallery.html is where the reception is.  The middle top picture is the table he proposed at.

Our cake is white cake with white choclolate icing (instead of fondant) and raspberry filling.  I wish Sprootles was making it but I can't have it all.

My dress is my Grandmother's wedding dress from over 60 years ago.  It is ivory satin and just gorgeous.  It was a little too small so the dressmaker put in new side panels and she is putting lace over the new panels.  

Our wedding rings and white gold with eight round diamonds evenly spaced around the ring.  We are also got white gold bands for our right hands.  We are having a family ceremony with Bri at the wedding to commit to becoming a family.  She decided she was going to call him Daddy.  The look on his face when she did that was so priceless.  

Premarital counseling is going great.  We are haivng so much fun with it.  

I have to admit that waiting until marriage is getting a bit difficult, but we only have 6 more days until the honeymoon at http://www.lazycloud.com/bandb/tiffany.asp.  That is going to be our actual room that we aren't leaving for the whole weekend.  That man is in serious trouble.  I am going to, well, anyway...

The downsides of the wedding:

My father's reaction was ""I have to absorb this and I don't know if I will be in town"".  Then he had the nerve to come over and tell Robert he was upset because I didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle.  While he had been drinking.  Um HELLLLLLOOOOO - Robert was a drug and alcohol counselor.  And he wonders why Bri is walking me down the aisle and not him?   At least SHE doesn't talk about me badly CONSTANTLY.  

I have had two friends tell me that they would like to be happy for me but just can't manage.  Robert's boss tried to hold an intervention with him about the wedding, managed to insult all of us and when he didn't cave, they let him go early.  

OK, have to go to bed.  Must get a wax tomorrow.  Anyone ever get a Brazilian?  I am thinking about it to a point.  

*HUGS & LOVE* to you all!!  I miss you so much!!"

I put in my notice at my job and am looking for another.  Long story, suffice to say that my views and theirs on Christianity differ immensely (they are way to hypocritical) and also Bri can't come to work with me any longer.  I will miss the kids so much but what is the point of working there to help other kids but don't see my own?

I have a boyfriend.  His name is Robert (what a shock!).  He works at Teen Challenge.  He is awesome and I think I am in LOVE!!!!  We just click.  We (me, Bri and him) were together all day and it was wonderful!  We had so much fun going to different farmer's markets.

BERLIN (Reuters) - An aggressive squirrel attacked and injured three people in a German town before a 72-year-old pensioner dispatched the rampaging animal with his crutch.

The squirrel first ran into a house in the southern town of Passau, leapt from behind on a 70-year-old woman, and sank its teeth into her hand, a local police spokesman said Thursday.

With the squirrel still hanging from her hand, the woman ran onto the street in panic, where she managed to shake it off.

The animal then entered a building site and jumped on a construction worker, injuring him on the hand and arm, before he managed to fight it off with a measuring pole.

""After that, the squirrel went into the 72-year-old man's garden and massively attacked him on the arms, hand and thigh,"" the spokesman said. ""Then he killed it with his crutch.""

The spokesman said experts thought the attack may have been linked to the mating season or because the squirrel was ill."

Alrighty then!  Well, I had a volunteer meeting yesterday (Mr. Marine was there but I didn't get to talk to him - too obvious if I sat by him and not the people whose team I am on).  I will be helping out at the day care center for inner city kids this summer.  I can bring Bri and Izzy, so yeah!!  I will be tutoring the kids and helping with field trips.  

I also found out that (for now) I will be on the schedule for the detention center 3 times a month on Thursdays, as well as going there on Sundays to play games with the girls and helping celebrating b-days every month.  Did you know some of these kids don't even know what a birthday is?  How sad is that??  I am thinking that I may start to bake cookies and stuff for them each week.  And I think I am going to start baking stuff for Teen Challenge (http://www.teenchallengeonline.com/) as well.  I am just waiting for them to call me back to see if that is something that is acceptable.  One of my resolutions was to spend the same amount as a week's worth of groceries each month as food donations.  I think this will be a good way to achieve that.  

<lj-cut text=""For those that don't know about Teen Challenge"">
Teen Challenge is one of the oldest, largest and most successful programs of its kind in the world. Established in 1958 by David Wilkerson, Teen Challenge has grown to more than 170 centers in the United States. If you would like to know the story of how Teen Challenge started as told in the book ""The Cross and the Switchblade,"" visit our store where you can order a copy of the book. 

According to the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use, an estimated 7.7 million individuals age 12 or older were in need of care for an illicit drug problem. Furthermore, an estimated 18.6 million persons age 12 or older were in need of assistance for an alcohol problem. Teen Challenge has responded with action to statistics like these. Providing residential and non-residential care for thousands of men and women seeking freedom from life-controlling problems, Teen Challenge has become their answer.

In the process of breaking down the addiction cycle, Teen Challenge has become a solution to the addiction crisis. Teen Challenge is known throughout the world for providing successful recovery programs. Enthusiastic law enforcement officials, judges, mayors, governors and other prominent community and country leaders advocate the mission of Teen Challenge. Several United States presidents have voiced their appreciation for the unique work of Teen Challenge.

Teen Challenge is structured to allow flexibility in meeting the needs of those whose lives have been shattered by addictions. Where residential care is needed, Teen Challenge offers a well-developed, multi-phased discipleship training program. Teen Challenge also provides extensive non-residential assistance through personal and group sessions. Prevention programs are provided to thousands each year through public school assemblies and church meetings.

Teen Challenge has significant impact on local communities. By the time an individual enters Teen Challenge he has typically had almost every relationship and family tie shattered that might be helpful in recovery. He has usually formed strong relationships with people and groups that actually perpetuate the addiction spiral. After completing Teen Challenge, hope is restored to more than just the addict, but to the family as well. Solid, positive relationships within community and family are also re-established. Teen Challenge involvement in a community facilitates a reduction in drug-related crimes in the area. Prevention efforts within the community improve since recovered addicts exert a profound impact on family, friends, and community. The economic cost to society is reduced and restored men and women become contributors to their community. Teen Challenge even participates in community projects, outreaches, food bank services, correctional facility meetings, thrift stores and work projects. Many Teen Challenge programs offer assistance and referral services to the community.

Well, I wanted to post a quick update.  

Good news - tonight we are getting a new addition to our household.  Her name will be Emma and she is a 3 year old pure bred yellow lab.  She was at the pound.  She grew up on a farm and they used her for breeding.  She was never even named.  So, hello to being spoiled, getting bones from the butcher and lots of love.  

Bad news - Dobie needs to be put down.  Right now Bob has him and is trying to get a second opinion but it isn't looking good.  Not that my vet recommends putting him down.  However, Dobie is having trouble walking, he is falling down the stairs, he is going to the bathroom in the house (he doesn't realize he is doing it), and he has been growling at Bri.  The vet advised me to get x-rays but they think he either has nerve damage or a problem with his spine, which is typical in dobies.  A few weeks ago we spent $650 in blood tests and such.  From that, they recommend B shots and prescription dog food.  The x-rays alone are $150.  

I can't have the dog going to the bathroom in the house.  What if G-pa slips in the pee in the kitchen (where Dobie likes to pee)?  The linoleum has yellow in it and it is hard to see; I can hardly see it.  Bri has slipped in it before. 

I feel terrible about this but I don't see a whole lot of options.  Dobie is at least 8 and the life span is 8 - 10 years old.  He limps constantly and I an already giving him anti inflammatories.  He can't get up on the couch any longer and he has lost 6 pounds.  I am feeding the dog the amount they recommend for a 100 lb dog.  And frankly, we can't afford to spend all this money on tests and things.  

We are getting the new addition so soon because Dobie is my G-pa's life.  He talks to the dog all day.  He is devastated by all of this but he doesn't want to spend all this money when the merciful thing to do is to let Dobie go.  

*le sigh*

On the bright side, My official last day is now 6/22/07.  We get paid the last week of June as well as 13 weeks severance.  WOOT!!!"

"event","Hit by high prices and fees, some gas station owners stop selling fuel

As gas prices hit another record last Friday, Jeff Curro couldn't take it anymore.

After owning the Shell gas station at 3075 N. 124th St. in Brookfield for 20 years, Jeff Curro has stopped selling gas. As gas prices rose, his profit margin dropped. 
 
He wasn't a motorist at the pump fed up by the blur of numbers spinning higher as he filled his tank.

Curro is a gas station owner who has stopped selling gas to his own customers.

After selling gas at N. 124th and W. Burleigh streets for 20 years, Curro turned off his pumps at his Shell station in Brookfield when the price he was being asked to pay was just too much.

Including the wholesale cost of gas and other taxes and charges, he was being asked to pay $3.44 a gallon Friday, a day when the competing stations down the street were selling gasoline for $3.47.

""Three cents a gallon doesn't cut it,"" Curro said. ""It doesn't pay the bills.""

Add to that the money he loses every time a motorist uses a credit card at the pump, and there was no reason to keep selling gas, Curro said.

Credit card companies and banks get an average of 2.75% on every gallon of gas sold, and credit card processing fees now rank as the second-biggest expense for gas station operators, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores.

""The way I see it is, I'm doing all the work of providing the labor, the wages, the electricity, the lighting, the maintenance of the pumps, the repairs and the insurance, which is quite substantial,"" Curro said. ""I'm doing all the work, and somebody else is getting fat on me.""

Curro isn't alone in deciding to not sell gas anymore. Casey O'Gorman did the same thing. In business for 25 years near State Fair Park, his West Allis service station is now doing business exclusively as Auto Analyzers. The Shell name came down a few months back.

""I finally had to just pull the plug on it and say, 'I can't afford to do it anymore,' "" O'Gorman said.

High wholesale prices
Curro and O'Gorman are leaving a relatively small and disappearing group of service station owners who both sell gas and repair cars.

Independent auto-repair shops face competition from car dealerships and quick-lube repair shops, and in the sale of gasoline, they compete against full-line convenience stores.

Most gas stations today double as convenience stores, and although they generate more than two-thirds of sales from gas, two-thirds of profit comes from in-store sales of cigarettes, drinks and food, according to the convenience store association.

When drivers are paying more, they think that means higher profits for the filling station, said Bob Bartlett, executive vice president of the Wisconsin Petroleum Marketers & Convenience Stores Association.

The case of the two Shell stations stopping sales of gas illustrates the challenges faced by independent station owners across the state, Bartlett said. Nine of 10 stations in the state are independently owned and run, he said.

Between Feb. 1 and Monday, Bartlett said, the average wholesale price paid by service stations in Milwaukee to buy gasoline rose from $1.66 to $2.94. Add in taxes paid to the federal and state governments, as well as transportation costs, and the average service station had to cover $3.47 on Monday, without charging any profit. On that day, stations were charging their customers $3.47 on average in Milwaukee, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report.

""People are upset about oil and gas prices, but it's not this guy right here,"" Bartlett said of the independent gas station owner. ""He's not OPEC. He's not refining it. He's buying it kind of like I am, right at the end of the line here.""

Sales up, profit down
Curro has been thinking about shutting down his gas pumps for about a year, and he has complained to his supplier about prices.

When he shut down his pumps, he was charging $3.59 a gallon, 12 cents higher than the competing stations nearby. 

""Even at $3.59, I was making 15 cents, but I was still giving 10 of those cents to MasterCard,"" he said.

Nationally, the Association of Convenience Stores estimates that sales rose 12% but profit fell 23% industrywide last year, and for the first time, credit card fees were higher than the industry's profit.

Lower margins on the sale of fuel and credit card fees were the two main factors behind the drop in profit, the association said, as profit margins on the sale of fuel dipped to their lowest point since 1983.

Until January, O'Gorman and the predecessors at S. 84th St. and W. Greenfield Ave. sold gasoline on that corner since 1938. 

He says he never made much money selling gas but started seeing margins nosedive last year when gas prices rose.

"event","Would you trust a guy who wrote that rape victims ""gain pleasure from being beaten, bound, and otherwise made to suffer"" as ""the price they are willing to pay for gaining the gratification of receiving the sperm?"" A guy who published his belief that ""the child who has suffered bona fide abuse may very well have enjoyed the experience...""? A guy who claimed that incest is not harmful, (citing Shakespeare) only ""thinking makes it so""?


<lj-cut text=""to read more disturbing thoughts..."">
<i>I know you think I'm talking about ""Opie and Anthony,"" recently suspended from their radio talk gig for ""joking"" with a guest, ""Homeless Charlie,"" who said he wanted to rape Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush. The hosts encouraged these horrifying remarks -- in fact they laughed and imagined ""the horror"" on Rice's face as she is held down and punched in the face. 

No, I'm talking about another sick reality. Let me ask you first: Would you trust a guy who wrote that rape victims ""gain pleasure from being beaten, bound, and otherwise made to suffer"" as ""the price they are willing to pay for gaining the gratification of receiving the sperm?"" A guy who published his belief that ""the child who has suffered bona fide abuse may very well have enjoyed the experience...""? A guy who claimed that incest is not harmful, (citing Shakespeare) only ""thinking makes it so""?

And I know I don't even have to ask this -- but would you trust this guy with your kids? 

I thought not. Which leads me to ponder how on earth the ""theory"" this guy thought up has found its way into court rooms across the country, and is currently influencing child custody decisions, especially those involving child abuse. That's right, this guy, a psychiatrist named Richard Gardner -- who, by the way, also asserted that adult-child sex is normal AND beneficial for both parties as well as for the survival of the human race -- is being given credence in cases involving the fate of children and families. 

And believe it or not, it seems that nine state governors have jumped on Gardner's pro-pedophilia bandwagon. In Florida, Indiana, Connecticut, Kentucky, Nebraska, Iowa, Maine, and Nevada, there is now reportedly a whole day officially dedicated to raising ""awareness"" about Gardner's theory called Parental Alienation Syndrome, in which the very reports of abuse by a child against a father are themselves evidence that the child is being brainwashed by the mother (and if the child is angry at the father, or doesn't want to visit, that's even more evidence) and the only ""cure"" for this syndrome is to force the child to live with the abuser and deny ANY contact with the protective mother, who has no history of abuse.

C'mon, you're thinking, what judge would buy this crock? Doesn't it matter if the abuse really happened? Apparently not.

Although it may sound like it, this is no sick joke. It's a sad, sick reality. And anyone who cares even a little about children's human rights and the epidemic of family violence should take note and take action. 

Let's start with the lowdown on ""parental alienation syndrome"" (PAS), which is also being called ""parental alienation."" Like I said, Richard Gardner thought it up. The late Dr. Gardner was a child psychiatrist who liked to tell people he was a full professor at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Actually, he was an unpaid volunteer. But hey -- professor, volunteer; child sexual abuse, fun adult-child sex -- hey, what's the difference? If you're Richard Gardner, not much. 

But I digress. While Gardner was volunteering at Columbia in the 1980s, he formed some opinions and made some personal observations that, together, he decided to call ""parental alienation syndrome."" He defined PAS as a condition arising from one parent's (mostly mothers, he said) ""programming"" of the child to wage an unreasonable ""campaign of denigration against"" the other parent (most of the time, the father, according to Gardner). PAS, he said, arises most often during child custody disputes, usually involves false allegations of child sexual abuse as part of the programmer parent's attempt to turn the child against the other parent, and causes ""enormous grief"" in the alienated parent.

Gardner's diagnostic criteria included finding out from the child the parent's ""frequency of programming thoughts"" and the parent's ""success in manipulating the legal system to enhance the programming."" The ridiculousness of these criteria goes without saying. Gardner was insistent that the ""programming parent"" is the mother, and that the alienated parent is the father. He opined that treatment involve forcing the mother to stop expressing negative views about the father and granting custody of the child to him and denying any visitation to her. No part of the PAS diagnostic process involves examining the father's psychiatric history or conduct, or even inquiring whether he had actually engaged in abuse.

According to an article by Dr. Paul J. Fink, past president of the American Psychiatric Association, and Hon. Sol Gothard, retired judge and former faculty member for the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges:

""Parental Alienation Syndrome has been used nationwide by batterers as a courtroom tactic to silence abused children by attempting to discredit their disclosures of abuse. This theory is not recognized as valid by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, or the American Medical Association. Parental Alienation Syndrome is not accepted as a psychiatric diagnosis, and has been rejected by the mainstream psychological community. Parental Alienation Syndrome is junk science; there is no valid research or empirical data to support this unproven theory."" 
To date, none of the studies necessary to judge the validity of Gardner's so-called syndrome have been conducted. In 2006, the Children's Legal Rights Journal (a multi-disciplinary journal published in conjunction with the American Bar Association Center on Children and the Law, the National Association of Counsel for Children, and the Loyola University School of Law) and the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges each published analyses finding no scientific or legal basis for the use of PAS.

And yet, PAS keeps making appearances in courts across the country, subverting and perverting the pursuit of justice one family at a time. According to the Children's Legal Rights Journal, a North Carolina court incarcerated a teenage girl who refused to visit her father, and a New Jersey court suspended a mother's contact with her two children, granting sole custody to the father despite ""'foreseeable emotional upset and possible trauma'"" to the children (Hoult, 1). In Pennsylvania, a court ordered a teenager into ""PAS treatment,"" and he subsequently hung himself. 

Young people who have suffered due to inhumane court rulings involving PAS are speaking out. 

They are not the only ones. This month, the NOW Foundation joined other leading organizations working on family law and family violence in a complaint filed against the United States with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The complaint charges that U.S. courts are failing to protect the life, liberties, security, and other human rights of abused mothers and children by frequently awarding child custody to abusers and child molesters. PAS is one predominant strategy being used by lawyers to place children in such danger. A recent Newsweek article noted the finding of a Harvard study that in custody cases involving documented spousal abuse, 54% granted custody to the batterer, and parental alienation was used as an argument in nearly every single one. 

This is not a trend that will fade away. It's junk science that's gaining momentum, amassing victims, fooling powerful government officials, and even attracting an unfortunately famous ally or two like Alec Baldwin. PAS advocates play down the theory's unquestionably absurd roots in Gardner's pseudo-science, pathologize and punish mothers fighting to protect themselves and their children, and stand faithfully by fathers' so-called right to unfettered access to their children despite any history of assault or abuse. And the judges and the media are buying it hook, line and sinker.

Do something about it. Contact the governors who've proclaimed ""Parental Alienation Awareness"" days and raise their awareness about what's in the best interest of our families. Contact the media outlets who are giving PAS advocates like Alec Baldwin a platform to lie to the public. Pressure your judges to educate themselves and get our justice system back on track. 

Gloria Steinem said, ""The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off."" I'm definitely pissed off about PAS and hope you are, too. It's just what we need to set our families free from junk science, junk justice, and sick realities.</i>

<b>Parental Alienation Syndrome is a putative disorder proposed by Richard A. Gardner as ""a disturbance in which children are obsessively preoccupied with depreciation and/or criticism of a parent. In other words, denigration that is unjustified and or exaggerated."" Although Parental Alienation Syndrome has not gained official recognition as a psychological disorder, case law has recognized it in child custody disputes.</b>

OK, I can see this happening as far as some women trying to get back at the man or vice versa, but can you really trust a guy that makes comments like some of those?

"event","A young lady was waiting for her flight in the boarding area of a big airport. 
As she would need to wait many hours, she decided to buy a book to pass the time. She also bought a packet of cookies. 
She sat down in an armchair, in the VIP room of airport, to rest and read in peace. 
Beside the armchair where the packet of cookies lay, a man sat down in the next seat, opened his magazine and started reading. 
When she took out the first cookie, the man took one also. She felt irritated but said nothing. She just thought, ""What a nerve! If I were in the mood I would punch him for daring!"" 
For each cookie she took, the man took one also. 
This was infuriating her but she did not want to cause a scene. 
When only one cookie remained, she thought: ""Ah...what will this abusive man do now?"" Then, the man, taking the last cookie, divided it in half and gave her half. 
Ah! That was too much. 
She was much too angry now! 
In a huff, she took her things, her book, and stromed to the boarding area. 
When she sat down in her seat, in the plane, she looked into her purse to take out her eye glasses and to her surprise, her packet of cookies was there, untouched, unopened! 
She felt so ashamed! She realized that she was wrong...she had forgotten that her cookies were kept in her purse. 
The man had divided his cookies with her, without feeling angered or bitter...while she had been very angry, thinking that she was dividing her cookies with him. and now there was no chance to explain herself or to apologize. 

There are 4 things that you cannot recover... 

The stone...after the throw.

TWO teenagers who wanted to experience murder told police it ""felt right"" to strangle a friend and bury her body in a shallow grave beneath her West Australian home.

The 17-year-old girls, who cannot be named due to their age, today faced a sentencing hearing in Perth Children's Court after pleading guilty to murdering Eliza Jane Davis in the small coal mining town of Collie on June 18, 2006.

As the girls sat stony-faced in court today, Prosecutor Simon Stone said they had confessed that after partying with Eliza on the Saturday night they decided to kill her.

""Sunday morning me and (her) woke up, and we were just talking, and for some reason we just decided to kill her,"" one of the girls told police in her interview.

""We just did it because we felt like it, it is hard to explain,"" the other girl said.

""I knew we had wanted to kill someone before.

""We knew it was wrong, but it didn't feel wrong at all, it just felt right.""

The girls planned their attack and changed into old clothes.

One of them snuck up behind Eliza as she was reading, wrapped speaker wire twice around her throat and quickly tightened it as the other held her down, trying to press a chemical soaked cloth into her mouth.

""She started not being able to get her breath, and we just kept going,"" one of the girls said.

""She was just yelling at us `What the f**k, what are you doing' .. `Oh you freaks, what's wrong with you psychos.""

Mr Stone said they chose to strangle Eliza because one of them had to return to Perth that afternoon and they wanted a quick and ""non-messy"" killing.

""As our friend, we did not really want her to suffer,"" one told police.

""We didn't really expect to get away with it.

""We were willing to take the risk.""

The girls regretted the fuss the killing caused but neither felt remorse for their dead friend, Mr Stone said.

""If she had died another way it probably would have bothered me ... but it just did not,"" one girl said.

The girls reported Eliza missing after they buried her and pretended to help her family look for the dead girl.

The girls turned themselves in several days later, walking into separate police stations and directing authorities to where they buried her body. 

Mr Stone told the court the girls had no remorse and were holding back on the reason behind their cold-blooded, premeditated, sadistic killing.

""It is a mystery your honour, what happened.""

He said the girls had discussed killing someone else and one had prepared for homicide by killing two kittens.

""Whilst together (they) will continue to pose some risk to others in custody.""

Mr Stone called for sentences of life in prison.

The hearing continues tomorrow.

"event","HAPPY BIRTHDAY CANOODLES!!

My mom just informed me that she would like to take some of her inheritance from Oma and possibly (depending on her budget) take Bri and I to Germany.   WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If so, I want to go to Bavaria since it borders France and Switzerland (can you say visit to Canoodles, Boe & Froggy???).  

I am so excited!  

Also, at a Bible study I go to, the Rev. came up to me and asked me to pray for the local detention center that we do a musical outreach program to once a month.  I said, OK, what am I praying for?  He said that they will be able to find 2 women to go and teach a Bible study to the girls once a month.  I looked at him and said are you asking me to pray or to do it?  He sheepishly said, to pray that you will do it.  So, I said yes.  I am hoping that I can up it to once a week to establish more of a relationship with these girls and work on issues they are concerned about.  I am so flattered that he wanted me to do it.  And a little intimidated."

<b>You can spend your whole life building something from nothing
One storm can come and blow it all away ... build it anyway
You can chase a dream that seems so out of reach
And you know it might not ever come your way ... dream it anyway

God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray it doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway ... I do it anyway

This worlds gone crazy and it's hard to believe,
That tomorrow will be better than today ... believe it anyway
You can love someone with all your heart, for all the right reasons

And in a moment they can choose to walk away ... love em anyway

God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray it doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway ... yeah, I do it anyway

You can pour your soul out singing a song you believe in
That tomorrow they'll forget you ever sang
Sing it anyway ... yeah, sing it anyway yeah, yeah

I sing ... I dream ... I love ... Anyway </b>"

"event","<b>Board gives initial OK to use handcuffs in MPS </b>

<i>Restraints will not be used this school year

A handcuff policy that appeared to be in something resembling handcuffs was approved late Thursday by the Milwaukee School Board after three hours of debate that was frequently angry, intense and downright confusing.

The net effect of the tumultuous meeting seemed to be that planning to begin using flexible, plastic handcuffs on students whose behavior is considered dangerous to themselves or others will continue, but a revamped School Board with four new members will have to give an OK before restraints can be used. They will not be used in any school during this school year.

Since the idea was publicized Saturday, it has become a subject of debate, with numerous political leaders in the African-American community and the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People criticizing the idea and saying there had been inadequate opportunities to give public opinion. Thursday's meeting was the second this week in which the School Board spent hours on the subject, and debate was stormy.

At the end of the night Thursday - and in its last action as a group - the board voted 7-1 to approve the handcuff policy proposed by Superintendent William Andrekopoulos, but with major constraints on implementing it. But the 7-1 vote was really a 6-2 vote because member Peter Blewett voted in favor as a political maneuver; the board majority then refused to allow him to change his vote.

""Obviously, this is a very heated item,"" Andrekopoulos said in proposing the go-slow approach to handcuff use. He said that all rules related to handcuffs would be approved by the board before the policy is implemented, that there will be efforts to get public input on use of the restraints, and that training of MPS safety workers on using the handcuffs will be open to the public.

""What's important here is for us to move slowly, but to still move,"" Andrekopoulos said.

But shortly before the vote, board member Charlene Hardin, the most vehement critic of the idea, said, ""If it's passed tonight, there will be handcuffs."" 

Earlier, she angrily attacked the plan as a way to ""shackle"" students that will only bring more safety problems to schools and turn schools into prisons. In tears, she said she and opponents of the idea had not been truly heard.

""You didn't understand, you didn't care,"" she said. ""What are you trying to do, destroy the public school system?"" 

Several board members who supported the idea said they agreed that beyond the handcuff proposal was the bigger issue of dwindling resources and inadequate programs in the community for dealing with troubled children. Some criticized legislators and others who they felt hadn't done enough to provide or fund programs that would lead to fewer violent students in schools.

Board member Jennifer Morales said everyone talks about putting children first. ""Hardly anybody is putting their money where their mouths are"" in doing that, she said. 

Voting for the modified handcuff proposal were Joe Dannecker, Danny Goldberg, Barbara Horton, Ken Johnson, Morales and Jeff Spence, plus Blewett. Hardin voted no. 

A new school board year begins next week and three of those who voted yes - Dannecker, Horton and Johnson - will be gone.</i>

Do you THINK maybe they could try other things first like, oh, I don't know, maybe TAKING SUGAR OUT OF THE SCHOOLS????  What about the processed food??  I am so disgusted.  This may be one of my new causes.  And the man that proposed this?  One of my dad's high school buddies."

Well, he is still in jail and will be there until Monday, when he has to go in front of the judge.  I just thank God that no one was hurt and I pray that this will open his eyes to what he is doing to himself, his family and his friends.  My dad is finally having to pay for his actions.  He has never spent the day in jail and now he has to spend the weekend there (Trust me - not fun!).  And no one will bail him out.  That has got to be an eye opener.

On the bright side, I helped a recovering alcoholic and homeless crack addict and fed a bunch of people this week.  And next week, I am visiting the local juvenile detention center (ooooh, think of all the people that I can help!!).  I don't know if any one heard this, but the crime is getting so bad here that there was talk about having the National Guard come in over the summer.  The ministry I volunteer with was a part of a meeting called by the local police captains and the mayor.  On 7/21, they will be blocking off one of the worst blocks in town and having a break dancing competition.  I am really looking forward to this.  I'm bringing some of the kids from the neighborhood (their mom is originally from that hood and having problems with her teens) and whomever else I can drag.  In addition to my book, I think this is where my life is headed.  Scary and exciting all at the same time!!  
 
(((((FLIST)))))  Thank you all for being there for me and letting me vent.  I love you all and appreciate you all!

P.S. My vacay is this summer when my job ends.  ;P"

Second, a friend of mine and I were talking about it the other day and she was mentioning our water supply was only so much then it would be depleted.  If this is the case, wouldn't the snow caps melting slowly be a good thing so they could replenish the water supply??  

Also, if Earth has already experienced 4 ice ages, then it seems to be that this would be cycle the Earth goes through by the Earth rotating on its axis.  I understand we may be accelerating it but it still seems to be this is what should be happening.  

Please enlighten me.  I am trying to broaden my horizons and form educated opinions.  

Thank you!!

Oma's memorial is on May 11.  Since so many are in different parts of the country, she wanted a memorial.  She is being cremated and her remains will be buried after the service.  Everything is in place, I just have to create the invitations.

I wrote this:
<i>Please do not mourn for me, for I have gone to be with my Lord.
Remember my love and my laughter
Remember the memories we made
And remember I prayed that we may meet again some day. </i>

for the Memorial card.  Don't ask me where that came form.

On a brighter note, Bri was diagnosed with pnuemonia yesterday by the hunky doctor at her clinic.  *eyeroll*

Oma died today.  Memorial some time in the future.  I have to go write an obit.  I called my dad to tell him (he was close to her) and he said thank you for telling me, then hung up on me.  *sigh*  And people wonder why my eye started twitching.

"event","I had a few revelations about religious fanatics this weekend.  First, as much as it says in the Bible that homosexuality is a sin, there are no ""degrees"" of sin so that sin is no worse than adultry or being a single mom (which is a HUGE sin!!).  So, if these so called Christians are blasting gay people, they need to shut it because the gay people aren't sinning more than the rest of us (or the people that are sinning by blasting them).  

My second revelation is that people are loving each other as they love themselves.  Unfortunately, a lot of people don't love themselves so they are haters towards each other. So, if we all start loving ourselves, then love others as we love ourselves, the world would be a much better place.   Until we love ourselves, treat others as we would want to be treated.  There, I solved the world's problems and it's only 11:30 am."

"event","<b>Bob Update:</b>

I talked to him last week after he had our receptionist on the phone for 25 minutes.  She is a friend of mine so he felt it was OK to talk to her about this.  He wanted to meet as closure and I said no.  There was nothing left to say that I hadn't already said.  The only thing left to say would be hurtful things and I don't want to do that.  I asked if there was anything he needed immediately from the house.  There's not.  I am starting to go through things in the house.  I want to make my built ins in my room a mini library.

<b>Oma Update:</b>
The woman is amazing. She has gone from death's door to teaching herself to eat with her left hand.  She can't talk but she is humming along to songs in therapy.  I will be getting her medical Power of Attorney soon because I am close by whereas my uncle is in Hawaii and mom is in TN.  BUT mom is thinking of getting a condo up here and coming up more often.  And, if her husband passes, she will move up here permanently so it would really be more of an investment.  Thank you all for your prayers and well wishes.  

<b>Life update:</b>
I am happily kicking my butt in TKD.  I am testing for my gold (first) belt in May.  I am hoping to start up the healthy lifestyle support group in April.  There has been a lot of interest.

I have been praying a lot to figure out where my life is going and to see what kind of blessing I can be to others.  More and more I am feeling a pulling towards writing a book geared towards helping others that are unmarried single moms or on my journey as a party girl.  What an unpleasant journey that will be.  I know the title - <b>Fallen</b>.  I just don't know the contents yet.  Either way, I fear that my past will disgust people and definitely shock more than a few.  I have quite the tawdry past.  I suppose I need to suck it up and just write what ever it is God has in store for me.

"event","I heard about this and thought it was interesting...

<i> <b>Sugar Blues</b> is a book by William Dufty that was released in 1975 to somewhat surprising commercial success. In the book, Dufty argues that sugar is an addictive drug, that sugar is extremely harmful to the human body, and that the sugar industry conspires to keep Americans addicted to sugar.

<b>Sugar Blues</b> is probably the first popular culture book that gives insight into the often overlooked link between diet and depression, and how a small dietary change, eliminating refined sugar, can make a huge difference in how good one is able to feel physically and mentally. Dufty even goes so far as to suggest that eliminating refined sugar from the diet of those institutionalized for mental illness could be an effective treatment for some.

Dufty may have been far ahead of his time, as researchers at the University of Florida have just discovered a major link between Fructose (50% of the metabolite of sugar) and Obesity in rats. The other metabolite in sugar, Glucose, did not affect the rats health at all. Fructose causes a spike in Uric Acid levels, which according to researchers disrupts insulin levels and makes the rats hungrier than they actually are. The widespread use of High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) since the 1980's with even higher percentages of Fructose than sugar have simply compounded the problem. So in the end Dufty may be right all along, and science is simply catching up. To combat the Fructose Metabolism problem if it also exists in humans, just drink plenty of water to dilute Uric Acid and avoid sweets. It is really just that simple, other carbohydrates (exceptions are corn, carrots, a few others...) do not contain Fructose or metabolize to it after digestion. So starches are OK, sugars that contain or metabolize to Fructose are not. This information is based on the latest research into Obesity and its potential causes.

A more recent book on a similar subject is Potatoes Not Prozac by Dr. Kathleen DesMaisons.</i>"

"event","Last Week I threw out Worrying, it was getting old and in the way.

It kept me from being me; I couldn't do things God's way.

I threw out a book on MY PAST
(Didn't have time to read it anyway).

Replaced it with NEW GOALS, started reading it today.

I threw out hate and bad memories,
(Remember how I treasured them so)?

Got me a NEW PHILOSOPHY too, threw out the one from long ago.

Brought in some new books too, called I CAN, I WILL, AND I MUST.

Threw out I might, I think and I ought.
WOW, you should've seen the dust.

I ran across an OLD FRIEND, I hadn't talked to in a while.

His name is GOD the Father, and I really like His style.

He helped me to do some cleaning and added some things Himself.

Like PRAYER, HOPE, FAITH and LOVE,
Yes I placed them right on the shelf.

I picked up this special thing and placed it at the front door.

I FOUND IT- its called PEACE. Nothing gets me down anymore.

Yes, I've got my house looking nice.

Looks good around the place.

For things like Worry and Trouble there just isn't any space.

It's good to do a little house cleaning,
Get rid of the things on the shelf.

It sure makes things brighter; maybe you should TRY IT YOURSELF. 
BE BLESSED AND BE A BLESSING TO SOMEONE ELSE!!!!

May the Lord open the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that
you will not have room enough to receive it all.
Malachi 3:10.

May the Lord bless you exceedingly abundantly above all you could ever
hope for.
Philippians 4:19."

"event","Well, I came home last night and what did I see?  I BEAUTIFUL  display of love from my friends!!  Thank you SO MUCH <b>Tara, Dexy, Sboof, Lish, Molly, Mag, Pen, Canute, Moon, Dora, Catz, Rosey, and Hermi</b>!!  You guys don't realize how much it meant to me or how much it was needed.  I have been a bundle of stress the past few days.

Update:
Oma is back at the nursing home.  She is eating less than 200 calories a day.  they sent her back to the nursing home because there is nothing more the hospital can do.  According to her Living Will, she does not want a feeding tube.  My uncle went home to Hawaii today.  We got a lot of her apartment cleaned out, but there is still stuff to do.  

I haven't talked to Bob since the fainting spell.  He forwarded me a few jokes, but nothing else.  So, we are technically not broken up because the words have not been offical said even though my heart feels that way.  He did talk to one of my friends/business partners to ask about Saturday's seminar.  And he left a message for my mom to see how we are and how Oma is.

"event","I am writing this in light of a flister's post but I thought it may help a few people.  

Don't let your parents' attitude define the way you feel about yourself.  I will share a secret with you all.  I was told that the only reason my parents got married was because I was conceived (my mom & dad).  I was told I ruined my father's life be being born (my grandma).  I was told I was the reason for all of my step mom's misery and miscarriages (my step mom).  I was told I will never amount to anything because I am worthless (my first step dad).  My mother told me she wanted to start a new life after her 2nd divorce and that life didn't include me (I was 14).  My mother lied to me about why I had to go back and live with my dad (so she could get married to a man that didn't want me as a step daughter).  I could keep going, but I think you get the picture.  

I was devastated for the longest time.  I drank a lot every night and had so many one night stands thinking that's all I was good for.  How could someone love me when my parents didn't feel I was worthy enough for their love?  I have hurt for a very long time.  I let people abuse me and treat me terribly because that's what I thought I deserved.  And then I had my daughter and I realized I had to help myself so she would be a happy and well adjusted child.  It's sad that I wouldn't help myself for me but I was willing for her.  Either way, it needed to be done before I ruined her life and mine.  

Helping myself has really been a huge struggle.  The only thing I have found that helped is turning to God.  Now, I cannot stand most religion and churches.  I think most have lost sight of what is important and have put up too many rules and are too puffed up with their own importance.  They seem to be the first to condemn.  Who would want to be around people that condemn and/or judge?  Most spiritual leaders need to teach about having a <b>relationship</b> with God not about following a bunch of rules and regulations that they have determined God wants us to follow (religion).  A lot of religious people are BORING.  Funny thing is, Jesus hung out with the undesirables.  Jesus performed his first miracle at a PARTY.  

God wants us to enjoy our lives and be prosperous.  God wants us to be happy and have peace.  But we will never TRUELY be able to do that without His help.  I am not recommending finding a church is that is not your thing.  I am recommending reading a Bible, finding some books on how to develop a relationship with God.  You don't HAVE to go to church to have a relationship with him.  

I was listening to someone named Shari Rose Shepherd this weekend.  She is a former Mrs. USA but, more importantly, she is an ex-drug and food addict.  Her mother actually sent her baby things back to her with a sticky note saying that she wishes she was never born because she caused her so much hurt and pain.  I also listen to another woman that was sexually abused for 15 years by her father.  She was really screwed up.  I think I recommended her before - Joyce Meyer.  You can listen to her podcasts on joycemeyer.org.  Yes, she is spiritual BUT she will be the first person to tell you that she cannot stand Religion and most churches.  

I have learned that if God is the first person I turn to when I have a problem, it won't seem as terrible.  If I stop trying to figure everything out myself and take it to Him, things work out a lot better.  

*HUGS and LOVE*"

"event","Hey all!  Thanks so much for the support & hugs for everything!  I love you all and I am so glad I can call you all my friends.

We don't expect Oma to make it through the weekend.  She indicated she was ready to meet God to my mom today.  My uncle and aunt are flying in Saturday after Oma let my mom know she wanted them to fly in.  Oma is just waiting for them to get here so she can see my uncle before she goes.  She isn't eating and who can blame her?  She is 91 and has lead a full life.  Right now, her life is lying in a hospital bed and that's not her.  Her right side is paralyzed.  She can't talk.  She can only nod and gesture with her left hand.  If she doesn't start eating, they want to insert a feeding tube but what is the point?  She is DNR and this is no life for her.  She was always on the go, out and about.  She lived life the way she wanted and now she wants to die.  

The thing is she always wrote me letters but I always avoided her because she was good at making me feel as if I didn't measure up.  She would include these articles on how to be a better parent, what to do to interview for a job, where to search for jobs, how to study, how to pay my bills, etc.  She even sent an article one time on how to meet men when I was dating someone.  She also used to take care of me every day until I was 10.  She taught me how to cook, manners, and how to clean a house.  She used to let me do her hair.  So many memories and I can't change the past...

Last Friday I actually took the time to sit down and write her a letter back.  Little did I know that she had a stroke that night.  I was just starting to take steps to spend time with her because it was the right thing to do.  Late last year I started coming around more and bringing left overs so she didn't have to cook any longer.  I've been to the hospital 4 times this week, so I feel good about that.  I am going to take time off tomorrow and spend most of the day at the hospital after I change the locks and get a new phone.  

I won't be on very much, but I will update when I can.

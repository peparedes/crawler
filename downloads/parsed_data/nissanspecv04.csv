"event","Well work hasnt been to bad. I havent done much work yet. Just alot of training. There are so many people that work there its hard to remember names but everyone knows me somehow lol. Grover told a few people about how much I know about computers and it seems like the whole building knows. I already have people asking me to go to there house to fix things and asking my suggestion on computers. Lol I get my first check for 80 hours on november 2nd so it should be close to, if not above, 800 bux :D. So im getting some glasses and getting a fone through verizon. Then I get my next check a few days before the Wii release so I will be getting one of those and a few games too. Then its saving time so I can get out of my house and get myself another car. So things are going really good right now."

"event","well I start my new job with the city this monday. A little weird about going to this job. It seems like its more professional then my past jobs. The pay is actually decent at 11.76 an hour and being full time with normal 8am-430pm mon-fri work hours I can do things that normal people do. Although I will just play warcraft alot seeing that the expansion comes out november 29th. Meaning i have a whole new guy to level to 70 and I will be on a new server. Blood elfs rock so far. My friend adam is a beta tester so I get to see a lot of new content before a lot of people and it looks interesting so far. Not like any of you have a clue as to what im talking about and you all are missing out. Also with the Wii coming out november 19th, I will be busy with that until the wow expansion. My plans to move out are still looking good. The house im interested in is still available. Now I just need to make this job work....basically my last chance at something good or im stuck with a crap job like doller general with no moving out, games, or school for a longggggggggggg time. So it WILL work."

"event","well I know I havent posted in a while. Just pvping a lot in wow and working. Well today I went in to work at 6am and when I got in I was called into the managers office. I go in and her manager was there to. So im thinking to myself great whats wrong now....because this is the worst company Ive ever worked for. They tell me they lost my paperwork again and said they were sorry. I laughed at them and said ""are you serious? You guys suck at being managers. I dont understand how you can even run a store."" they looked very suprised at me. I told them im tired of being the only person that shows up to work on time, does more then expected, stays late if they let me, and doesnt call in. I get no respect from them at all. They think its a game. Well its not for me anymore. I need money so I can get out of my house. Get a car with cash so I dont have to make paymesnt anymore and get back into school. They apologized again and I told them to stop saying they were sorry and to grow up. I filled out more paperwork, for the third time, and said ""call me if you get it right this time"" and left. that was around 630am. well around 2pm I recieve an email from the city of st.pete, the place a friend of mine works at saying they are interested in hiring me for 11.76 an hour, 40 hours a week. Woot. I start october 16th. This is awesome. I wont be going back to my last job. So I have a few weeks off now to ""recover"" lol. 

One of the best things is I can move out now. My friend that works there, grover, knows a lady renting a 2 bedroom House. And said she will cut us a deal if we want it. I went with him and looked at the house today and it looks awesome. over 1100 square feet and fully furnished too. This weekend I will get to see the inside of the house but through the window it looked awesome. Brand new furniture, wood flooring, huge living room, and only 950 a month. Not bad with the money him and I are making. So im planning on january being moved out of my house. This way I will have a few grand saved up and be able to move out comfortably. So i really hope this job works out. It will make everything so much easier for me. Which is good because im tired of working hard and having nothing to show for it."

Then I did one hour of stock and cam home. So yea good first day. Now all the money I make from this job will go to a car that I wont make payments on and school. Once thats done I can start looking to move it. So it should be summer os '07 I will be moved out. Figure thats a good timeframe. well Im gonna go back into the pool. Later"

"event","alright as most fo you know Ive been going back and forth from operating systems for a while. Only sticking with windows because it supporst World of warcraft compared to linux which doesnt. So im not to thrilled about windows at all. Well the more I read about vista, Microsofts next Operating system, the more excited I get about it. Im all about performance, I upgrade everything in my computer as fast as I can because I love to push the limit of computers. Well there are two features vista has that xp doesnt and can certainly use. Its called ""Superfetch"" and the use of external memory devices. What windows xp does now is when you load an application like photoshop or warcraft that program is loaded into you ram(memory). When you exit the application a little piece of that program stays in memory in case you need to start that program again during THAT session. Shutdown erases that little piece so it takes a long time to start again. Well Vista kinda learns what you use most. So with me running warcraft everyday it will always be in memory making it load extremely fast. Also, some of you now know that adding ram to your computer speeds it up. well what if you can add that ram in the form of a usb drive??? Enter vistas ""external memory device"" support. Lets says you have a 512mb usb drive laying around and never use. Dont throw it out, add that to your comps ram. So if you only have 256mb of ram, your now up to 768MB. Thats a nice improvement. So instead of having windows use whats called the pagefile system(programs running off of the the hdd instead of the ram or both) will now have more space to run off ram which is much quicker also meaning faster load times. I can go on and on about the improvements im reading but im exhausted so im going to sleep. L8r all."

"event","well im gettin pretty close to being level 60 in the game. Highest level until the expansion pack this year which will then be level 70. Its so freakin awesome. I need more people from the sammitch krew to play it. Its taken me close to 12 days(288 hours) of play time to get where I am, and thats of course with helping grover with 2 days of play time(48 playing hours) I have a guest pass where you have 10 days to play the game for free. kyle I know your computer can play it, zack im not familiar with yours and max I have no idea what you use. david knows his comp situation, and petes laptop I dont think is capable. so if any of you want to give warcraft a try let me know. Ill bring over the game and key and install it. Give you a walk through show you some sites that helped me out. well im going back to playing for a few hours before work, l8r all."

Besides, I would get the cable and road runner free along with digital fone service at half price so thats over 120 dollars saved right there.

My aim was compromised but I fixed that so you can message me again at This Jason Says. For a while I was thinking about going into the air force. I mean school, basic school like college isnt my style. So ive been meeting my recruiter a lot. Then this afternoon I wake up to my bro giving me the fone. I say Hello and its Brighthouse. They ask if im still interested so in a second I decided to take the job. So after waiting about 3 weeks to hear from them they finally call. SO I will be a Network Wiring Technician for Brighthouse and will be getting free road runner, cable, and fone service. ANd a van with a laptop and a whole bunch of training with sweet schooling options paid for by them and a lot of tools ive never heard of. The Air force would of been a lot of fun and im still considering it but If I can stay here with all my friends and family then I would prefer it. Training for the USAF is in texas and ive always wanted to go but now with all the cash im gonna make I could own land there. This is awesome. O and the most important thing. I Turned 21 on wednesday. I got some cash and an awesome blue L.E.D binary watch. Im too lazy to get a link for you but go to thinkgeek.com and look at the watches section.

I gave them the 400 I got from kyle and now I have to sell the system fast. Its 2 12inch auido pipe blue series subs each 850watts, 1 800watt crunch amp model DS-2400vu, and a nice prted box. I told zack he could get it for 300 with the stereo deck in my car but I wont be able to do that now. The lowest I can go is 350 since thats what my friend needs to keep the debt away from annoying his parents. Sorry zack, if you still get it maybe I can get the 50 back to you. So please post around and ask around about the car system im selling. To zack only will go the head unit. but to others it would be the 2 subs, a box for them, the wires, and the amp. Im sorry for not keeping in contact. Kyle I will be at your house the first chance I get so dont think im avoiding you. Its been hard on me and my friends family. Also my aim ID was stolen so please dont send any info to it. When I get a new name Ill send it to each of you personaly. Now I go back to my friends house."

"event","Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846.
John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946.

Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860.
John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.

Both were particularly concerned with civil rights.
Both wives lost their children while living in the White House.

Both Presidents were shot on a Friday.
Both Presidents were shot in the head.

Now it gets really weird.

Lincoln 's secretary was named Kennedy.
Kennedy's Secretary was named Lincoln.

Both were assassinated by Southerners.
Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.

Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was born in 1808.
Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy, was born in 1908.

John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was born in 1839.
Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy, was born in 1939.

Both assassins were known by their three names.
Both names are composed of fifteen letters.

Now hang on to your seat.

Lincoln was shot at the theater named 'Ford.'
Kennedy was shot in a car called ' Lincoln' made by 'Ford.'

Lincoln w as shot in a theater and his assassin ran and hid in a warehouse.
Kennedy was shot from a warehouse and his assassin ran and hid in a theater.

Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.

And here's the kicker...

A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland
A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe."

Things like hooking up hdtv, surround sound systems, running fone lines, cable lines, setting up wired and wireless networks, and some other things that they said I would learn if I was hired.

"event","well tonite was wierd. I hung out with grover the whole day. we're bored so we're chillin in my pool and david says ""lets go to sawgrass park."" I say why to look for aliens??? and he says yea. SO i say ok. my brother and his friend travis want to come too. So we hang around my house till about 11pm then we walk down 62nd ave to the st.pete times building and and walk the creek all the way back to where the water towers are and I see a gaurd outside so we turn back. Travis says that instead of walking all the way back around we could go through the sewer right back into my neighbor hood since we're right next to it. Looks safe so we all head down into the sewer. lol this is no short sewer or big either. we are all walking like we are catchers on a baseball team for about 100ft. We get to the part where the gutter goes into the road and my brother and travis(who are smaller then me and dave) wiggle out of the sewer onto the street. This is right in front of travis's house, well his aunt comes out right at the same time so him and my brother take off running as not to be seen. Me and david are stuck down there cause we cant fit to wiggle out so we have to turn around and basically crawl all the way back. It was very uncomfortable. I didnt think david was going to make it though. I get out first and I noticed flashlights right across the creek. So I turn mine on and ask them if they have seen a dog lol. They say no and ask  if im ok, im like yea, im just looking for a black german shephard and they say ""well let you know if we see it."" Like they know who I am. lol Well david finally gets out of the sewer and we walk back to my house to meet up with travis and my brother. At this point me and david are soaked with nasty sewer water GROSS and sweat. So we change. and then we go back to another part of my neighborhood and find a way into the locked park through someones yard. Well after you walk through the yard you come to this open field all lit up by lights from the water towers. So we run across and come to the creek again past the security post and climb under the fence thats there. When we finally get into the park close to the gate we all see something different. My brother sees blue eyes travis sees a wierd fog take form, david sees a fence and then I see ""somethign crawl or walk right out in front of the fence and stop. its kneeled over and something smaller is walking towards then away from it. Well Ive seen wierd shit back there before so I start to back off but everyone wants to go closer. SO I walk out in front of them and watch this wierd bent over thing. Then there is a little blue flash of light. the size of a firefly but not a firefly, because they arent blue, they dont explode and it doesnt move over 20 feet in one second about 30 feet away from you. after the first flash david says""what the fuck was that"" really loud. As soon as he said that, that wierd thing I was watching looks at us and then there was a second flash a lot closer maybe 10 ft from us. Lol I take off running the oppisite direction and I hear david travis and my borther following me. well we walk all the way back home and its about 130am when we finally go over whats happened. As we are talking about it all the power in my house goes out with a sudden flash. We are all stunned. I wait a minute and go and reset the fuse for the house. What a wierd and very long night. Im gonna take a shower now and them im going to sleep. Hope im here in the morning lol l8r all"

"event","well I think its been a while since I last updated. I quit my job a couple days ago. I couldnt take it there anymore. So im gonna be out looking for one basically till I can get one. Anyone know of anyplaces hiring?? Also I helped my brother get his first car.  He's the oppisite of me, he doesnt want speed he wants reliability and comfort. So we went and checked out a 1994 Ford tempo. Man that thing was clean. Only 60K miles on the car. Interior is full carpet blue and everything is power, seats, mirrors, steering, everything. The sound system is stock but damn it hits way above average for a car that yr. The body is in near perfect shape too. Oh and nice cold ac. Its not a very quick car but thats what he wanted. Well im going out to fix his door locks and power windows. Happy birthday to Zack too. L8r all"

"event","so yesterday right when I got off work I came home for a little bit and decided I wanted to work on my car. So I went to my friend jims house.  I spent about 4 hours working an my car. I got a SAFC (Super Air Fuel Controller) from a friend. The safc lets you control the amount of fuel that mixes with air in your engine. Well after a couple hours of work I realized that my car is newer than the instructions so I couldnt use it. I have to get an SAFC 2... o well. So after being awake from 3pm wednsday I didnt get to sleep until about 4pm on thursday. Then I slept until 6am today. Then I went back to jims and installed my Air to fuel ratio gauge which tells me how my air and fuel is mixing, lol I got that one to work and it only took 2 hours. I guess now im gonna sleep for a couple more hours. Then I have to decide if I want to buy another battery now or next week. l8r all"

"event","well I dont think ive really updated in a while. Not much to say really. Ive just been working a lot. Im starting to really get tired of where I work. I like the job but the people are idiots. Everyone thinks they are a boss and tell others what to do while the bosses just sit around and complain. Im going to try to get a job at brighthouse soon. I will get free road runner and cable will be discounted. Ive raced a couple people with my car. Won most of them. The few I lost too were serious contenders though. One with a Cobra mustang, V-8 320hp and 317lbs of tq wieghing in at 3400lbs, another against a Acura NSX V-6 290hp and 224lbs of tq wieghing in at 300lbs. My car is an Inline 4 with 165hp and 170lbs of tq wieghing at 2700lbs. I expected to lose since my car is under 20k to buy and those are above 40k. Ive also just been spending a lot of time around the house. Just sleeping. I convinced my parets that if they pay for my first class and registration that I would start school this august. So thursday morning im going to spc to do all that jazz. O and I also broke down and got a credit catrd. Checked everything out first to make sure it wasnt one of those cards you activate and have to pay 300 bux for lol. Well I think im gonna go watch some tv. L8r all"

"event","I discovered at the Pattie House this weekend that it has been wayyyyy too long since I updated last.  I discovered this b/c someone asked me ""Where's Cody?"" and when I said ""Not too sure..."" they reacted all crazy like, at that moment I realized that a shit-load of ppl probs think we are still togther.  We actually broke up about a month ago... So there you go ppl who I primarily keep in touch with through LJ, Thibs is dunsky!!! LOL Sad but true!! Really the friggin reason I haven't updated in a while is b/c I live in Norland...and everyone knows Norland has no internet. LOL There are a few other random things I wanna say and I always find it the easiest to do this in a list:

1. Dani Wallis leaves Banff f-ing Alberta today and comes back into my life for approx. a week...it will be unspeakably magical and I will rejoice every moment...LOL...the only thing that could be better is if Philly was coming too...

2. Never try to date someone who originated in Norland...even if they do leave it for good...yes I know this sounds hypocritical b/c I am from stupid Norland, but I think the town is just too small for two Norlanders to date ONEANOTHER...

3. Living at home for the summer doesn't have too too many benefits (except ur rents spot u some cash now and then)Next year, I must find a job in Guelph

4. JennN gives the best frigging b-day gifts in the WORLD and I LOVE her for it...but it also makes me sad b/c I am not as good at it and want to return the favour, but just seem to be less talented in general than she is, at most things (except for at nuggling, everyone knows i am the best at nuggling)    

5. Boys can sometimes just be supremely dumb,(funny, but dumb) here's a tip for all you aspiring playas' out there:

If you want to sucessfully attempt to date two girls at the same time, calling them everynight, asking them to go on little daty things and text them 50 times a day, try to make sure that you are not carrying out this plan with two BEST friends who have been so since like grade 10. ALSO you should try to make sure they don't work together.  They will probably notice sooner or later... Another good thing to consider...you should probably try to avoid pursuing your best friends ex-girlfriend of 3 1/2 years less than a month after they break up!!!! This is just a basic moral..LOL OHHHHH BOOOOYYYYYSSSSS   WILL THEY EVER LEARN????

Anyways...thats all for now...

LOVE"

"event","Well:
Tonight was one of the most brutal nights ever!!!  Lindsay and her boyfriend came over and wanted to go out to the bar.  They decided the Ranch would be a good idea.  It wasn't.  the line up was huge, so we decided to go see how it was at Franks. I will tell you how it was at Franks...SHITTY!!!! We waited in line for about 1 1/2 hours, and we were at the front of the line for like 45 minutes of that time.

Things I discovered after tonight:

1. I hate bouncers...well most bouncers

2. I hate girls who are pretty (because they get in without waiting)

3. People who smoke in bar lines should stop

4. Court should pee before we leave home from now on

5. You should be on guard at all times for bar fights, so you don't get involved in the biggest one ever by accident...simply by walking by at the very second it begins

6. If u are gonna try to go to the Ranch you should always bring an extra shirt that doesn't say ""I Love Cowboys"" on it in case you don't get in and have to be a misfit at another bar while wearing it  

7. Old women are apparently hotter than me because they get in without waiting too (they must have been pretty girls when they were young)

8. Club Vinyl has less than 10 people in it at 11 pm

9.  I need to start drinking so that I can find nights like this funny rather than annoying

So as I have already written, Court just bought a new bocce ball set, and the day she bought it we went and got Andrew, Boose,and Janzen to play with us in the park behind our house.  It was insane fun, we seriously just spent the afternoon in the sun playing around all carefree like.  Then today, court decided we needed even more outdoor games and bought a badminton set.  We put it up this afternoon and only stopped playing at like 7 ish.  Andrew and JennN were here and it was just so relaxing.  A couple more days like this and I will have no problem with life at all!!! Man, I never realized how much the weather could make me happy, but it did, and it couldn't have possibly came at a better time!!!!

1.It floods....well, just the basement where my room is

2. It is currently freezing cold, and none of us can figure out how to fix it, and when I say cold, I MEAN crazy cold

3. The phone jack in my room no longer works...because my landlords husband cut it by accident and then left without fixing it

4. Sometimes it smells like mothballs

5.  Lastly, its missing Dani Wallis

Anyways, it basically frusterates me but, I still wouldn't give it up for anything in the world.  I am really gonna miss it this summer, and all of the fun that I have with Fare and Court.  Those girls are what holds me together most days let me tell you, well and on tuesdays and thursdays Jenn N helps too!! LOL I am so glad that that we became so ultra close this year...at the same time I miss my BLPP family and am more than looking forward to my summer with them.
I have been trying to be optimistic about my problems lately, but it is kinda hard.  Of course the weather and the new Bocce ball set Court just bought help tonnes.....

I had come to the previous conclusion that the reason why I barely ever did work was because I had people around me who were much more intereseting than Canadian history to distract me.  What I have realized though, from spending this entire weekend alone, is that I do even less work when there is no one around.  All I have done so far this weekend is eat, and watch TV and movies.  Hardly productive.  Basically, I think that I just never do work, no matter what the conditions.  I am the biggest procrastinator on the planet....anyways, since I have done nothing this weekend, I have nothing interesting to write about!! COME BACK FARRAN AND COURT COME BACK!!!!!!

"event","It seems as if no one has been updating lately besides Jack...and although Jack is from Woodville which makes him cooler than the average bear, I need to know about other people as WELL as him.  I have also not been updating and I am assuming it is for the same reason as everyone else...too much damn school work!!!  Anyways lots of interesting stuff has happened...

1.Cody and I got back together

2.My basement flooded

3. My aunts husband beat her to the point where she needed to go to the hospital

4. I killed my aunts husband and am now updating from prison

Well, starting with the Cody situation... Things have gotten much better now!!! I think that he just didn't think that I was being serious before when I told him I was unhappy because of my easy going attitude and also because I am basically happy a large percentage of the time.  So anyways it seems as if he realized when I broke up with him that I meant business!!  So things are FOR SURE better now!!!

The basement is indeed flooded here at 48 Rodgers RD. and it is no good b/c that is where my bedroom is.  Thankfully nothing belonging to me has been ruined as of yet, but it really smells down here!! My landlord is kinda stupid and isn't coming until this weekend and I told her about this last wednesday!!! On the bright side we now have an indoor swimming pool in our house.

So the last day of reading week my Aunt Dale, who by the way had a brain annurism like 1 1/2 years ago had to be taken to the emerg.  This is all becaus eher reject of a husband decided to slam her head off of the dashboard of their car until she passed out.  She is fine and everything except for the obvious inhuries i.e black eyes etc, but it is lucky she did'nt die because of her previous head injury problems.  So needless to say things have been tense with my family lately as she is the baby of the family, everyone wants to murder him, and he is being a prick and trying to gut FULL custody of their 3 year old baby....  I have NEVER seen my mom so angry in my life, and I have seen her pretty MAD!!!

So yeah other than the above I have just been loaded down with school work to the point of exhaustion!!! I am so glad that it is almost all over and I can make my way back up north where everything is a little more relaxed...other than above mentioned problem.  But that good old Balsam Lake Provincial Park job is starting to look better than Matthew Mcconaughey in board shorts...lol oh I am a geek

Well, I have zero funds...this is for sure the truth.  So regarding this situation I have a few things to report:

1. Tried to get the STUPID bank to give me money but that isn't looking too good

2. Running out of money real fast and regreting buying a ridiculas amount of uneeded clothes with my OSAP earlier in the year.

3. Good news, I got a job today and it only took me two days after handing in resumes

4. Bad news, its a good job where I have to actually do whole week of training and a bunch of tests and shit and therefore HAVE to MISS my ENTIRE reading week.

So ya, I really need money but I also am pretty stressed these days and happen to also need my MOM.  So oh well I can go home for the weekends and that will rock...also in one week I will make almost one whole month rent.  SWEET

Courts BF Luke is coming here from HALIFAX tomorrow, his flight lands at like 7 am.  We are all super excited and I can't wait to meet him because he seems hilarious.  Tonight we had a luke preparation night and painted our nails and did other make ourselves pretty things.  Also we made him a bunch of CUTE sugar cookies shaped in hearts and decorated them all CUTE.  Mine were the best...lol j/k.  Anyways it was a fun night which I really needed!!! My roomies are two cute kid let me tell you!!! Also what made me happy is that Farran showed us her abs tonight (because I noticed them and made her, but seriously she has an actual six pack...all that hard work is paying off. Hopefully someday if I keep going at the eliptical machine as I have been lately I will also look like a fitness model!!!! lol

"event","Well:

Today was valentines day!! This is the first Valentines day that I can remember being alone, as I haven't been single for around 4 years.  Needless to say it was weird.  What also didn't help is that I recieved roses this morning from Cody which he had ordered before we broke up...not so good times!!  I am so confused about life right now that it is astounding!!! Even though I know that not being with Cody was the right decision and I don't regret it at all I am having a hard time adjusting to how it feels to be alone.  You don't realise how much your daily activities and thoughts are organized around the person youare with until you aren't with them anymore...and that is what I need to overcome.  I really wish that Philly was here because she is my saviour in times like these, but the fact that she isn't is an even bigger sign that I need to do this on my own.  Also another thing I REALLY don't understand is how do all the boys around you who didn't even seem slightly interested in you before all of the sudden want in ur pants two days after you are single???? It is a bizzare fact of life...
Anyways thank GOD for my friends because without them I would probably literaly die of stress...
Until next time....

Quick summary of my life these days:

1. I have been working out alot and feeling guilty when I don't
2. I have been eating so much that it doesn't matter how much I work out
3. I have been missing Philly and Dani more and more with each passing day
4. I have been contemplating my life and my relationship and have realized that    some things have got to change
5. I have been finding quotes to make me feel good about these changes such as ""Action may not always bring happiness; but there is no happiness without action""
6. I have been watching alot of reality television... like American Idol and The Bachelor 
7. I have not been doing too much school work
8. I have been making sweet love to JennN because she is basically the only person who I ever see that I don't live with
9. I have been learning German... Meine name ist Jayme...Ich bin 20 jahre alt...you get the idea

Well JennN stayed over last night after the OC, and helped me to bake her B-day cake/brownie cake.  This was tbe most detailed ridiculas cake of all.  We actually were up until 4:30 in the morning making the cake and didn't get to sleep until 5.

  The cake involved a rainbow made out of sourpatch kids, an actual house crafted out of candy lego with white icing in between each brick as mortor, a candy sun, and a border of peanut M&M's.  It also included 4 different colours of icing.  LoL!! It was good times.  We couldn't start the cake until real late because I had a paper due today that I had to finish.  And we also had to wait until Farran was in a deep sleep.  Court made her a breakfast in bed of pilsbury cinna buns which was sweet because I got to have one too!

We are going out to Franks tonight which will rock, Cam and Drew's house and also Andrew's house are coming out, and Farran is having some friends here from home.  Yeah New friends!!!

Anyway the last question of the night will be... COULD THERE BE A BETTER TIME THAN THIS?"

"event","McDonald's, as you all well know has a plan called McDeal days!  One of these McDeal days is a two cheeseburger meal. This meal is the best of all of the meals for many reasons...Here are some of them:

1. The cheeseburger meal falls on thursdays which are the same night that the OC is on and also the night of our OC parties, so really...who has time to cook

2. The phrase ""I betcha can't eat just one"" simply does not even need to be considered because...well..theres two

3. It is by far the most filling meal you can get without supersizing

4. It reminds me of the times when my life was good and Philly was still in guelph and she and Andrew would go every single thursday for this meal and sometimes call me to tag along

5. There are McDonald's pickles on the cheeseburgers and McDonalds have a superior pickle

6. At McDonalds you can ""Eat and Laugh and Share""...wait I think that is the pizza hut slogan... but oh well it still applies here...except for the SHARING part, and also I guess the laughing part because you are too busy EATING, but as I said ""at McDonald's you can EAT""

7. Farran always lures me into going by saying ""it's two cheeseburger night"" when really all she eats is the chicken nuggets

So Really what is going down here is that I am going to eat two cheeseburgers for dinner...if you didn't already catch on, and I am gonna LOVE IT!!!"

Court has noticed the same silver car parked outside of our house every morning for the past three days, and everytime she looks out the door he sees her looking and drives away.  He only leaves when she OBVIOUSLY looks out though, if she just peeks he stays there.  This morning he was parked facing our house with the window down and she stared out and he left then later this morning he was there again, and she was in her room with just her bra on blow drying her hair and then she saw him and closed the blinds...within ten seconds of closing the blinds he was gone...its scary.  So we are gonna keep an eye out for him and if we see him again we aer gonna get his plate number and call the police just to have them do drive by checks. Just to be safe."

1.  I slip on it about 3 times each time it comes, and never is it a non embarassing slip like when I am alone or something...oh no it always happens in front of really attractive but obnoxious boys who laugh at me but offer me no help while I am trying to pop my dislocated ankle back into place

2. Sometimes when I fall I have my very overdue egg salad sandwich lunch in my hand that took me a while to prepare but have no time to eat at home beacuse I am late for class, and it falls onto the ground and I can't make any new lunch until about 4 o'clock

3. It makes my socks wet, and ruins my shoes

4. I have to scrape off my car before I can drive and my hands get real cold

5. I have to change into new pants each time before I go back out because my previous ones are soaked all the way up to my breasts

6.Tuesdays are garbage night and garbage is bad enough without really cold rain

Why did I get out of bed today?

We documented this incident with photos and are hoping that none of the places we went had a camera! We decided that dropping all of the bags in one place would take too long and would therefore increase our chances of being caught in that particular place so we dropped some off at Zhers and some also at Lambton.  Oh man it was sooo funny, students at Lambtonsaw us doing it too. We decided that this method of garbage disposal was much more fun but perhaps a little too risky!"

I feel like court and I became so much closer this weekend which is good because it is a first step to feeling happier here without Dani and Philly!! I hope that I have that much fun all of the time from now on...if I did I would have no reason to be sad!!! LOL!! Well I kinda wish Farran was here this weekend too but like I said, it gave me an oppurtunity to have soooo much fun with court!!! Wow, well here goes the weekend...

Friday:

1.We go to the Guelph Storm game where I find myself to be infatuated with Ryan Parent (Team Canada Juniors), and we have laughs over this
2. We get yelled at by the events staff for taking pictures of ryan parent...lol
3. The guys behind us (like 10 of them)are all hitting on us pretty hard! Theguy behind me was really persistant and everytime court got up to get beer he would ask me really bizarre questions like ""Do you like Zebras?"" WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ALL ABOUT.. not too sure!!
4. Guelph wins....
5. We leave the building and get hit on 3 more times before we leave....weird
6. We go to Frank and Steins which was kinda dull but we had fun anyways
7. I pull an illegal u turn in front of the po-lice and DON'T get pulled over
8. we eat sunsuns and subway and are content

Saterday:

1. Jenn N and Gord come here from Missasauga..needless to say...good times
2.We want to go to the ranch but.. the line up is down the highway
3. We go to Franks again for like the 4th time this week
4. We wait in line for 2 hours...nearly freeze...and Jenn almost gets in a few fights with the pushers behind us..lol BITCHES
5. We finaly get in and Court gets hit on more than ever...we get lots of pictures 
6. We eat sun suns again and each gain at least 5 pounds because of the constant sun sun's diet  
7.Court talks to surfer boy and introduces him to me as ""Surfer"" lol
8. We meet this guy on the way to the car who says he plays for the London Knights and his name is Ryan Davis, later we discover that they had a game last night...in Barrie, and that there is no Ryan Davis on the team... Court wishes she hadn't of chanted his name at him down the street...
9. We go to Andrew's house until like 6 am and smell insense while boose and Janzen saranade us with their guitars and organs...at some point in the night I draw a fairly accurate picture of the male anatomy...not too sure why???
10. We come home and sleep until I get a call from Germany..

So summary is basically got alot of male attention which is nice for a change...there must be something in the air...had insane good times, watched everyone get real drunk..and got lots of pictures to prove it!!!

Hopefully tonight I eat something for dinner that isnt sun suns...

I have a dilema..it's that if I want to pass my english class, I will have to read all of the assigned readings from the entire semester before tomorrow which is when the exam is!!! I am so glad that I never procrastinate because life could getreal hard if I did!!!! Oh well, when I say pass what I actually mean is get a decent mark, because I will pass even if I don't go..but it is my major so probs a good plan to hit the books at least for a bit!! Dani is here right now so I am having lots of fun, and philly was here real late last night...we all coloured, and debated whether or not girls who are real slutty colour in their spare time! We decided no because we wanted to be special.

Had Christmas with the gurls last night and gave away and recieved some pimp ass shit!! Here is a list:

From Dani: Oc calander, fuzzy socks, and shirt from garage
to Dani: Fun PJ's they are blue and sexy lol  also socks from ae

From Farran: cutest stuffed cat ever with real big eyes..she named it pussy
To Farran: Brown roxy T shirt with blue writing that I really LOVE and socks from ae

From Court:Change container thing that is really trendy that says makeup funds on the front because...well i like buying things of the sort...alot
To Court: Bath and body products from american eagle and ae socks

From Court and Fare: The best sweater EVER from garage that I was gonna buy for myself but for once resisted and save the governments money...aka OSAP

Oh what they would do to me if they only knew what their money goes to...lol!!! SUCKERS

Anyways it was basically a good night overall
We then went to watch King Kong..and can I say that I LOVE THAT BEAST...HE IS ONE SEXY BEAST...oh what a loser I am!!!
It's not just me tho, we all wanted to marry king kong...it s the BEST movie ever, really better than any other!!!
Tuesday Jenn and Philly and Kula and I got together and we had our christmas together too, it was awesome we all made eachother really cute gifts thati love so much more than anything...and no philly yours is not as you say ""amature"" or ""elementary school"" I LOVE IT!!!! Anyways the christmas season is a time of ove and sharing, so I hope my prof was in that mood when he wrote the exam that is going to kick my ass tomorrow...

All for now...
Later"

"event","Well, I have just been soooo busy lately!!

Finnally I found a house and am soo excited to move in next year!!! it is soo perfect and i will be happy to get out of rez.  Well Alicia is gone and nothing in this entire world could have made me more happy then that. I have so much homework to do today because i have been slacking out of depression all semester!!! Last night Jenn and I got Thai food and that was soooo good, we also sat down and watched a movie which helped me to calm down from the crazziness that has been my life these days.  I have been organizing my new room, doing tonnes of house stuff, trying to fit in Cody this weekend just past, figuring out what was up with Andrew, and all of this has left me wasted.  I just need to try and relax today and do some homework.  Oh yeah, and my fish died, which is a sad sad thing!  I was so happy to go home this weekend and see cody and my family, i needed them after the week i had had.  Cody was comforting but his mom was being nasty to me all weekend, which was not easy for me to deal with after all of my alicia stress!  But anyways that is all over now, I just need to concentrate on my future, and that means that it is HOMEWORK TIME!!!!!

Bye,
Jayme"

"event","So... Somedays I just don't know what to do with myself!!!  I had a great week at home until I discovered that my roomate is great big huge fuck up!!! She broke my vase, she let that walking STD Skot sleep in my bed ALL weekend, she got like 4 I.R's, her friend peed at Jenn's door in the hall and to top it all off she went onto my computer, pass my password, and got me kicked off of the internet!! Not too mention all of the ignorant things that she has said to me all year so far... all i have to say is that i have had it!! She can't run away from her problems any more sooner or later the RA's are gonna find her, even if she does hide in south forever.  And Skot is not good for her he hits her and she has bruises all over her arms from their supposed ""play"" fighting. Oh well, she has asked for a room transfer to south and i hope to God that she gets it!!! That would be the best christmas gift EVER!!! I am sooo excited to go home for christmas, i am excited to give Cody his gifts and to find out finall y what he got me.... I cannot wait!! Jenn and i had a sad day wen Andrew left for the break, we will miss our ""top Cack"".  He is a cutie, he got me a Roxy sticker for my car to cheer me up because he knew that i was upset about Alicia.  Jenn, Andrea and i watched princess diaries two tonight and it made me happy, that chris pine is a GOD!! I miss Cody every single day especially when it's a stressful one like today was! He is such a sweetie, i dunno what i'd do without him around to keep me sane!! So anyways Jenn, Philpott and i are having a little mall trip tomorrow which will also help to make me feel better but then i will have to come back and have my meeting with the residence manager that my R.A has set up....EWWWW! I dunno what to tell him, i want Alicia gone but i kinda feel bad!! She isn't a completely horrible person she just needs a major reality check...oh well i think that it is time for bed... Night"

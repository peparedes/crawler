"event","Phew its been too long.
I dont seem to have any time anymore. 

Life has been very stressed of late. My head has been in turmoil and things just got a bit much. Just went through a bad patch and i really would not have got through it if Silverseckmet and Knightclubber had not come to the rescue. I owe them so much. 

I am trying to look up on life and how lucky i am to be surounded by the people that i am. 

Even though i knew lots of people i knew wernt going to the Coven i decided to go anyway. Had good time seeing Bunster, CovenAlex, Spaul and others. Had to go home early due to severe tyredness zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Havet been sleeping much lately and i think it caught up with me. Aught to get myself to Luton more often, lots of nice people."

"event","<P>Last week was pretty crap on all fronts really, i did have a good weekend though. on saturday i had a bit of a relax even though i had to get out of the house so not to have a row. I had a good session down the gym and then went on to the workshop where i am really suprising myself at what i am producing. Appart from a aggressive meeting with some local lads it wasnt a bad day. Sunday was good even at the time i got up to get there in time. I met up with <lj user=""Knightclubber"" />&nbsp; and <lj user=""Silversekhmet"" />&nbsp; and enjoyed one of my favourite pastimes, SHOPPING. I managed to get all the supplies i need for my winter projects now all i need to do is get them done in time. I got some good ideas to try out at the market, unfortunetly the tax man knicked alot of my overtime money so i didnt have as much to spend as i would have liked (even though i spent to much). Camden may need to be posponed (only for a little while though).</P>
<P>This week hasnt started off to bad, i got called op to the office where i thought i was going to be saked (YIPEEEEEE). No such luck but i got something nearly as good a bit of a pay rise. I also got told that if things keep going the way they are i'll be a director in January. Unfortunetly the rest of the day was spent cleaning the drains that were blocked and moving two tons of rubble that the builders left behind. I'm doing late shift this week (2pm till 10pm) and i'm kinda looking forward to the weekend. Who knows my mood may improve!</P>"

"event","Its been a while since ive updated cause ive een at my dads house in livonia but nothing really bigged happened because i was there.  Except for on Saturday i went with carrie to Neil's show and it was actually a fun time.  Neil did better this time mostly because he wasnt nearly as nervous as last time.  After the show we went with a few of his friends to coney and let me tell you that was a fun time! i dont think i ever saw carrie so annoyed..lol! Neils friend, the drummer Joe kept on shooting spit balls at carrie along with a bunch of other shit and i was just waiting to see when she was going to blow up at him...which would have been great! Today was actually a good day but very long...altho the poking from Jon and Evan got a bit annoying...lol!! i hate sitting in front of Jon in sociology..hehe!! I also realized how much i need a job.  I can't get a actual job being that im in softball right now but like a babysitting thing or someting on the weekends would be great.  I hate never having money on me!! That's it for today...im off to dinner at the pancake house with my fam!!!

"event","Today started of awesome because it started off with me and ashley and courtney cooking biscuits in foods class which by the way was awesome. Were the best cooks ever, they were AMAZING!! not much really happened today except for the fact that i had softball conditioning after school and that sucked so bad cause i hate running and in softball we dont een really run..lol!! I just got back from softball and in a hour i have to go to the softball cages till like 8:30 which sucks by the way cause the OC my favorite show ever is on at 8 and i cant miss it beause summer and seth kiss and their my fav. people in the show.  Them together was the reason i started watching this show and then they broke up for a while :(....now they might get bakc together and i'll miss it..AHHHH!! Anywho, i was talking to Maria and Michelle today in my 7th hour and the topic of sadies got broughten up and i realized that the dance is March 12th and i have no one to ask. Like id ask one of our friends but none of them really like dances except for Evan.  I'd ask evan cause it'd be fun and its not like it'd be weird or anything cause ive known him forever but i dont even know if anyone else is going or if he'd even wanna go this time.  It sucks cause its my senior year and you should go to everyting and i feel like im going to miss everything.  I already didn't go to Homecoming and morp and now its going to be Sadies as well.  And then Prom, thats a whole other issue.  If i don't go to prom ill be so upset cause thats like the one dance that you can't miss and im almost positive i wont get asked.  I hate having to worry about all this, and now that i got thinking about it, it's never going to get out of my head!! Well thats it for today...again another borring day for me...I love it!!! By the way...Carrie your going to love your gift and im still not going to tell you because you NEED TO BE SURPRISED!!! HAHA...lov ya girl!!

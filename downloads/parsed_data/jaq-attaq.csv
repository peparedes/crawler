"event","the world is covered in sunshine and my smile stretches from one end of the rainbow to the next. hahah ok not really but it sounded pretty philosphical huh. k maybe not. anyways, this weekend was eventful even if i didnt roll to andrew foxes w. lex, i had my own fun. but speaking of lexie...im scared for her. shes my best friend (one of a few) and it just seeems like shes messing up kinda right now. but then i think...its not my place to be her mom, its her life and her descision, i really dont care as long as she calls me in the morning and tells me what happened. but yea, we will see how this little phase pans out. and leslie and i hung out for the first time in a while on saturday. that was great. i miss her i mean she is my best friend toooo. but i am STOKED for her birthday on the 3rd and her birthday party that lexie and i are planning for her on...THE 9TH....as we like to call it. (yeah...pencil that date in...) and i saw tyler this weekend, my other other best friend. we fun...i had fun...i finally got to tell him what i wanted to tell him. even tho i was kinda mad at myself for not making it perfect liek i imagined it...and for him not saying it at all the PRIME (sorry) times he was going to...but then i realized, when its something like this, when and where shouldnt matter. it was all about the words and what they meant. and i am SO glad i get to know what it feels liek. and so glad i got to tell him how i feel. finally i dont have to say it with hash marks i can just say i love you.




I LOVE ALL OF YOU.

(but thanks to 11pm curfews...cough cough....they must...end) and then i just smile, all the way in the house, all the way online, all the way to bed, all the way thru my dreams, until i see u the next day and feel the butterflies again.

"event","so this has definatley been an eventful couple of days. i forget if i wrote about this yet...but i locked my KEYS IN MY CAR the FIRST 3 HOURS after being grounded. i got ripped a fat one...especially when AAA pulled up in front of haley kaesmans house w. their HUGE headlights. i was so scared. but fianlly it got opened. grrrr...im an idiot. but that incident reminded me of saturday when a friend of mine had her own AAA experience. that was a big shit-fuck from us all...but its ok, she bought me a frosty afterwards. truce. hahhaha! hmmmm...i really dont have anything else worth saying, well i need to edit the names hardcore...i got bitched out by ""tommy"" because of somehting i was NOT aware of and he really hurt my feelings. so there. hahahaha...i think i've guilt tripped him backk wayy too much. but this is the kind of stuff that happens when were all back together again!! yayyyyy girlies, were back! :)  o and i havent said anything about ""hmmhmm"" in awhile - ok, jk i like just talked about him in the last one of these...but anyways i always have stuff to say about him. im still veerrrryyy fuzzie and happy and never get bored hanging out w. him, even tho there is NEVER anywhere to go. thats kinda gay, but im gonna blame long beach for that. and i realized how much my feelings for him are different from other guys beacuse when ""tommmy"" told me that ""hmmmhmm"" was pissed about something and i felt so horrible...i mean i went to the kids house to tell him that he heard wrong and that it wasnt about him. he wasnt there, but it was the thought that counts...haha. but it was really strange about how i cared so much and how i needed to be positive he wasnt mad. i really cannot screw this up...its way to perfect. but i hate haveing to be the forward one. its kinda strange cuse ive never had to do that before, but its chill i guess. aww sigh aww sigh...ill shut up, but its just so great i cant help it. 
o yes...and on a different note, im spazing out right now. my boss just called me and told me that i didnt have to work my shift today, but she wants me to come in and have a ""chat."" i really think that im gonna be in trouble because i was like 30 minutes late one day and then i ate a pretzel one day and never paid for it. ehhhhhh (cringing in scared pain) i hope i dont get fired over some oversleeping and BREAD!"

NO NO NO NO!! we get back in the car and it doesnt start...so i freak out and then whatever....long story short i realize that i kinda may have ran my car out of gas, so yes u guessed it...FATTIE MISSON! we go across the street to the gas station and buy one of those gas canteens and fill the $11 piece of plastic w. $2.29 a gallon rip off gas. (tyler scoring points the whole time....i seriously would have died if he wasnt there being a boy) so moving on, $30 later, we put a gallon of gas in satan and the shitter still doesnt start, so we pop the top and fiddle, take something plastic off of something....i really couldnt tell you, but anyways, ty finally starts it. drive it home its fine. drive it to get my phone exchanged....(thats a different story) and then when im leaving second street it DOESNT START. i tripp out...try to start it like 235254532532 times and it doesnt. then i try to be butch and look at the motor, i just get confused and kick it. whatever. i get the thing to start 10 minutes later. then mr. i saved jaqueleens car and pumped her gas man came over and my mom made me take it to the mechanic...grrr....she makes tyler go ( i swear to god i owe that kid sooo many favors) so we go....the guy fiddles grunts...says i need a tune up etc...i dont know. he gets it to work. so its all great and happy....except for when i get down the street and my seat slides off the tracks and im  to drive the traffic circle w. my seat ALL the WAY BACK. i was so scared adn now im driving w. a crate holding my seat so i can reach the pedals...but it pushes it up so far that i look like those 90 year olds who can drive w. their teeth becuase they are so close the the wheel. hahahhaa.....please dont laugh if u see me driving. 

oh and as for the cell phone situation....it randowmy cracked (the screen) so i cant see anything on it and yeah i totaled my phone, that means ive ruined appox. 4 phones in 1.5 years....grrr.....

and today, just to top stuff off...and speaking of top and off...alec was showing off his boobies and was like ""o ahhaha look at jaqueleens"" and pulled my bathing suit top pretty much off....that probably was one of the most embarassing moments ever.EVER.....and spank please was RIGHT there...err....NOT CUTE...i was violated by a 7 year old...

anyway, the evil bitch was increasingly mean and unaffectionate. she denied an invitation to the grand ceremony of graduation and that was the last straw....BLACKMAN was ready to ge this hands dirty. well maybe jsut regular dirrrrty....BLACKMAN (aka jawanna man delaney) flew through the town and landed in the evil gf's bedroom. u can take a stab at what went down. once u go black u never go back, but she needed to learn her lesson. she was scared but being the bitch she handled the shlong. it made her want her old boyfriends... 7.989 times bigger increases pleasure u know....so the bitch and bf were reunited again...thanks to black man and mojo. so they lived happily ever after until the evil bitch became bitchy agian and the bf strapped some on...and put the bitch in check

"event","So i did the stupidest thing ever today. I read my ex's livejournal. And now, I am absolutely crushed by the fact that he ""wasted"" a year and a half of his life with me... if he felt that way, why would be do all that stuff he did for me? All those names I was being called.... they hurt. It makes me glad I ended it now, and that I have someone who really cares for me, someone who loves me as much as I love him and would never hurt me like that ever. I'll admit, for a second I *was* having some doubts but I'm certainlynot anymore. However, it does comfirm the fact that I will no longer be using Livejournal so I do not do that by accident again. if you guys still want to keep in touch with me, I have a  myspace, www.myspace.com/aerowynn. Goodbye guys."

All in all, lately I'm pretty happy. I started talking to Matt again, because I realized I was a hypocrite. I tell people not to change for anyone but themselves, yet there I was not talking to my best friend because a certain person got jealous? Wtf? Especially since my relationship with Matt is exactly like the relationship I ""had no reason to be jealous of"". Hmmmmm.... a little selfish maybe?  But anyways, yea I'm having lots of fun with all my friends again, I got in touch with everyone and now we hang out a lot more :D  and its my birthday on saturday wooo! I'll be 20! No more teen for me! oh I am having such a good life now, everything(well, almost everything) is working well.  I just have to be patient for some other things :) Anywho, talk at you later

"event","so. My cat's being put down tomorrow.  Great christmas present huh.  Thats two of my cats in less than 6 months.  It's hard enough getting over one, and before I even have there goes another one.  I'm just waiting for the dog to keel over too now.  Oh, and maybe you can take the rest of my family too now,'God'.  There's still 2 cats and the humans you missed.  Better yet, why don't you just strike me repeatedly in the heart with lightning or something. I'm sure it would hurt less.  So I would suggest not bringing cats up around me for a while, or meowing.  So if anyone elseout there thinks they're having a bad time of it, I think maybe they need to rethink whats important in their lives.... like the things you do have.  Because before you know it, thay're gone.  And you'll never see them again.  They'll never meow at you again while your making a sandwich, you'll never sneak them your food again, or hear them purr, or have to turn the television up because you can't hear it over them purring.  They'll never be there for you when your having a bad day. Ever. Again."

"event","I am about to have a momentary lapse of the hard outer shell I have taken years to build around myself to hide myself from the cold hard truth that I could not face.





I hate myself.


I am a rutheless, cold, bitchy, hateful, egotistical, self-centered, angry, horrible person.  I'm an emotional wreck.  I'm not even sure if I could properly be called human anymore.  I had to face the horrible truth tonight, when I let the old me out.  I realized just how distant and cold and horrible I used to be.... and then I realized that not much had really changed.  All that happened was that the cesspool known as my soul finaly had its fill of peoples shit aimed at me and I could no longer hold my emotions as I once could. The only change is that I go off like a flawed timebomb and stop just as quickly, but I still have no room anywhere in me for anyhting good to happen. Anyone that gives me anything of their own free will is only trying to fill up the impossibly big hole, and they can only fail.  There is no room for anything but the hate and contempt I feel for those who let their weakness show, the weakness I spent so long envying others of and trying to hide it behind the cold-hearted mask that is me.  I cannot show the emotions that matter. They have been stripped out of me and forever banished behind the walls that will never crumble, never break, not matter how hard I beat at them.  I have realized that I cannot be anything more than a heartless unloving selfish bitch no matter that I want to be something else. It has been a mask so long that I do not know how to be anything else.  Not only do I have no hope whatsoever for myself, but I bring with me those who would try to help me. Anyone who tries to help me, I hurt unintentionally.  I am so jealous of what they have that I can never have that the only thing I know is to bring them into the pain I feel every day, the hopeless sorrow of the endless black pit, the mountain I can never seem to climb over.  There are only two people I know how to be, only two people I CAN be, and neither one is any good.  Both are horrible mockeries to remind me that I can never be anything but a weak horrible person that should never have been brought into this world and most certainly does not deserve to be anywhere near someone who shows so much love and trust and innocence in the face of all my hate and screaming and stubbornness and cold-heartedness.... and just everything.  You know who you are.  There is just no cure for this, and there is not enough love in the world to fill the hole I created myself to protect myself.... I should just save everyone the effort and pain and go somewhere far away where no one will remember me or much less care that I removed myself from this place. 


I'm done ranting, sorry guys that this is so long but I don't know how to put it behind the link thing and you'll probably just skip over all of it anyways till the end and say ""oh yes thats a good idea please"".  That's all.  I'm done."

I mean, I know that I've decided that this is not what I want to spend my life doing... but should I still finish the useless courses that I wouldn't need for anyhting else with like a 60 average if I was lucky, or should I drop them and try again?  urgh, I'm just so sick of school right now, I totally overloaded with classes this year... because I wanted to finish as quickly as possible.  But I realize now that that isn't the way you should live, you should take the time and enjoy it instead of insanely rushing through everything to hurry the hell up and get where you want.  besides, I think I need more time to decide what I really wanna do.  I mean, I know right now what I wanna do but I also know it's more than likely just a passing thing that will go away within the next little while... but it would still be pretty cool to build like rockets and cars and planes and stuff ^-^ (to those who know where this is coming from, shut up  ;P)  anywho, maybe if you guys could give me your opinions on what I should do, I kinda need them on this one  ~_^  and remember, a waste of time is worse than a waste of money in m opinion.... you can always get more money."

So next week I have a midterm like every freaking day so I gotta do a lot of studying monday or tuesday... aaand last wednesday some creepy jerky mcjerkerson guy back out of his driveway into me and I just happened to be driving my mothers car that day... and now he's saying it wasn't even his fault EVEN THOUGH three times in our conversation he said it was totally his fault, he even saw me there too.  Yea, so I had a busy week... but this week shouldn't be too bad other than midterms, since I have monday off and no chem lab on tuesday.  Oh and right now I'm housesitting for my sister so I can raid the fridge hehehe... if she had anything inthere anyways XP  and she got a little kitten who's name is Nazi (pronounced Nassi NOT like Hitler's regime)whome I am babysitting ;p  So I'll get back to that I guess hehe...laters!"

"event","well.  I just found out I'm completely screwed over for my money right now. apparently, although they didn't tell me when I first went in there to get the visa OR when I went to make the appointment that since I'm still in the probationary period at Superstore I can't gt a credit sheck or some stupid thing liek that, so it's gonan be at least another MONTH before I can get my damn books.... which means that there's no way I'm gonna be able to pass my classes now.  AND now I can't even pay my mother back for my ticket OR the laptop!  SO I have no idea what the hell I'm gonna do now, maybe I'll take out some kinda loan or something even though that'll put me even more in the hole than I am now.... aaaaaargh why must this always happen nothing ever works out even the slightest bit for me does it..... ><  and I have to wprl today which totally sucks I hate work especially when I'm going to school since it cuts out my homework time and the very little time I spend with friends.... oh wait I don't have friends hehehe  XP  aw well, guess I better suck it up and managage somehow huh."

"event","Well, I'm updating on my new laptop from the college right now. It's pretty cool.... so I'm gonna need your help setting it up hopefully tonight caleb.  Unless of course your 'going out with friends' of course.  You know, this last month has been really totally and completely shitty for me.  Yea, I figured since other people let everything out on here, maybe it's high time I finally did too.... but I'm pretty sure you won't like it, there's a lot of shit piled up in here. So if you don't want to hear it, skip this whole damn entry.  



I just don't feel like no one cares anymore, if they ever even did.  You know, it really kinda hurts to be lied to no matter how small a lie doesn't it?  I know you've all felt it, I know you know how I feel.  its just so frusterating to have this happen to you.  But see, I can't even explain how angry and torn and hurt I am unless you understand where I'm coming from anyways.  Like, I hate myself for being the way I am, completely and utterly.  I HATE being extremely jealous, I HATE being paranoid off my rocker, Ijust bloddy well hate it all!  But, you just can't change like that, it takes for one a lot of time.... and it also needs people who will help you with changing.  They aren't for example, making it better when they can't come outright and tell you what they think.  It also doesn't help when your having a really shitty goddamn life and everyone just basically ignores you and doesn't listen when you suggest something, but as soon as someone else does oh THAT'S a good idea, lets do THAT since she didn't suggest it.  I'm always made to feel liek the outsider, just once I'd like to feel liek I fit somewhere, I don't even care where! I don't fit in at tim hortons, all anyone ever does is talk to each other and ignore me... its obvious to me they don't want me there, they're just humoring the stupid girl, and they always make excuses to stay away whenever they can.  Like saying they'll only be oh... an hour or so, than they're lets say a LITTLE BIT 3 hours late?  Seem a little suspicious to you?  Probably not, but it sure as hell does to me.  It's obvious to me these certain people don't want me there, they've never said anyhtign different, so maybe I should just do them all a favor and drop off the face of the planet.  Or at least their part of it.  I know they'd be a lot happier together, without me puching my way into the middle of them.  I know they want to be together and just want me out of there.  Maybe I should just do everyone a favor and kill myself.


There you go, I warned you not to read it if you didn't want to hear it, so if you read it it's your own fault don't get on my case."

I had earth sciences which is the class I'm really interested in... and chemistry was good, the teacher actually explains stuff for you in that class unlike stupid calculus... and I bought some of my books so I can like start on some homework now and have some free time later if I wanted hehehe. I really should go shopping for lunch meat soon though, or I may starve to death at school XP  although I met up with Tom and Ashley(whom I work with) today for lunch, that was fun... and then Tom and I went out for coffee after school and I told him how I scared the crap outa Caleb and he thought that was hilarious ;)  anywho, I'm gonna um.... maybe do some homework now."

"event","well, the first day of college went better than I thought it would, but it still sucks darnit :P  So I need to buy 2 more binders, and 3 notebooks at least... as well as some sorta special graph paper... and lotsa school books which'll be expensive.  I don't think I'm going to have much time to work while I'm going to college either, there seems to be a lot of homework involved... at least not for the first semester since it's completely packed... and to top it all of, I'm pretty sure I have a cold now too, bleh.  Aw well, if I have to sell my car I will I guess...I'm gonna type up my notes now."

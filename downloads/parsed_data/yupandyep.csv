"event","Man. Things have been strange for me. I was so lonely and so desperate, but now I feel so... indescribable. I have to know what I want. This book, while I have resisted in some parts and fought in others, I must admit, that it holds truth. It was right all along about interdependencies not creating true intimacy and it was right about consciousness and beliefs creating health and wellbeing. Did I listen? No. Did I try? No, I fought. Am I listening now? Sort of. I'm trying to listen to my body and hear what it has to say.

Reason is overrated. 

I had a really long conversation with James at Emily's house the night before the 4th of July. We talked about so much stuff, it was insane. I surprised myself by talking about inspiration, but unfortunately... I didn't write about it and neither did he, and so we forgot a lot about what we were talking about. Damn margaritas! Why were you so delicious?!

Anyway, I'm learning to sew and it pretty much rules.

I hate that toilet. All day, it runs.

I felt pretty heartbroken about Jeff and all, but I think I'm over it. I've been having a good time lately and I guess that's really all that matters. When things come down to it, I've resigned myself to indifference in love. 

Blah. Sometimes, I get this feeling that everyone already knows everything about life and that I'm the last to know. Like I'm always the last to discover love and heartbreak and I'm not as immune to it as other people. It's theatrically dramatic with me. Everything is always so hardcore, dammit! Drama drama drama. 

""You're just passionate.""

I guess, but is that a good thing? 
One word: 

Overwhelming."

I told Benny The Mallet about G-ma B's husband exposing himself to me the other night. I keep wanting to tell Mom about it. It happened so long ago and the old bastard is dead. What could Mom do? What could she say? She'd only be upset, you know? Still, I get this feeling that I should tell her. There's no reason. 

Mom found a slide of porn in a box. We threw away a whole box of Dad's stuff. 

It's father's day. I forgot to call him. I remembered at work, but my phone died. I haven't called yet. 

It's Sierra's birthday. I've been thinking about it all day. I don't know what to get her. I have a feeling that it should be something real special. She's... 16?! WHAT!!! No way. Damn. Just... damn. @_@ That's what happens.

PENIS

I keep thinking about this guy's penis, too. It's so gross. Fat and crooked. It had so many purple veins on it. He used to masturbate when he was on the phone with me. He was such a creep. I was new back then.

I feel all old and used now. Used, especially. There is nothing but sex and no love anymore. I cannot aspire for more. I don't believe in love. I was not made to be loved, only to love. I fall in love with everyone and get heartbroken. I'm addicted to having my heart broken. 

There are mysterious bruises on my knee. Pressing on bruises is a special feeling. It's not painful or pleasurable. It's both.

Sororities are awful things. Bruise pressers, the lot of them! All day pressing each other's bruises.

I've been feeling a little heartbroken lately. One of my friends is avoiding me. There's really nothing I can do about it. It kinda sucks the way I found out. Really, what can you tell someone who is avoiding you? If he wants to come around, he will. If not, then the alternative is always for the best. Maybe it's just something I say to admit defeat, ""it's for the best."" It's for the best. Rejection is a totally heartbreaking experience.

I don't care about you anymore. I just don't care. I never asked you to do half of the stupid shit that you did. I told you that. So you imposed those unreasonable constraints on me.

Last night, I had a dream that I was dreaming. That's a first. I dreamed that I woke up and then did some stuff and then I realized that I was still in a dream. When I truly awoke, I was confused and unsure if I was sleeping or waking. There was some moments of complete clarity. ""I'm sleeping. God don't let me wake up.""

Blake and I are/were suppose(d) to see a movie sometime this week. Thursdays are a no. Since, I have a film class. He said no Fridays. This weekend, I don't feel like seeing him. It's always back and forth. I'm beginning to believe that he just talked to me because he liked me. Isn't that always the case though? TH and I were talking on MySpace, getting caught up and whatnot. Out of nowhere he sends me a message:

gotta say this cuz its doing me no good keeping to to myself. i would like to be more than friends with u, if ur not interested let me know, if u want me to leave u alone i will, honesty gets u extra cool points 

What the crap? No! So, there it is. I think he was just talking to me because he wanted to be ""more than friends"". I think ""being friends"" is one of the requirements before being ""more than friends."" What a creep.

I have a feeling that I'm going to be single for a really long time. I'm not girlfriend stuff, there isn't the right kind of guy out there for me. I don't know if I'm the type who will ever get over her committment-phobia long enough to fall in love. Falling in love is such romantic bullshit. Maybe I'm turning cold-hearted. I don't ever feel appreciated in relationships and maybe I never will. Maybe that's because I'm really not that great of a person to date. It wouldn't surprise me. I go from distant to clingy.

Listen to this crap: My scholarship comes with a $200 worth of books per semester agreement thing. Well, you don't get to keep the books. The programs uses the books they already bought and count it off the $200 that you are supposed to get. So, I have a French book (used price: $94.50). The cost of all (6) books for my Spirtuality and Lit class is $74. What crap. They should've not charged me the almost $100 for a single book that I already am borrowing from the Luper library. This is shit! Also, what are they doing with the money that they are supposed to have but aren't letting us utilize because they keep charging us for books the program already has!

He'd talk about how important his career is to him, but then his reasons for living with Christina seemed a bit conflicting. Maybe he was lying to me. I get that feeling a lot now. 

I am totally over him. I realized this the other day when Mom started talking about him. She wanted us to get back together. :-/ She asked me if I miss him. I said I didn't. It was pretty much amazing for me at the time. Ah, the sad truth. I'll never love JR the way I did ever again. It was completely unhealthy and too compromising. He had unrealistic expectations and I guess I did too. I didn't expect him to be so selfish! But then, I guess it's because I liked him so much I didn't listen to everyone else. I had no idea that so many people thought JR was selfish. Really, I should've remembered that he was referred to as ""The Selfish Bastard"" before I ever met him. 

Anyway. I realized that it doesn't matter to me if JR is doing cocaine. Then I felt a little sad. Like, what if JR died? Maybe because I went to a funeral, I am thinking of this. I'd probably be sad. I wouldn't feel guilty though. He does a lot of stuff without thinking it through. Maybe his brain is already damaged. He probably wasn't clean for the majority of his college career.

She likes to put people down a lot. Gives her pleasure. She's sadistic. I dread being here. It's messy but she doesn't help. She complains all day about this and that and changes nothing.

I've been told that I'm a nice person. I'm too considerate. What the fuck? You can't be too nice! What's that supposed to mean? I end up hurting myself from being too nice? I could see where that would be coming from but I think it's far better to be nice while it lasts. It's not my fault that people are shit. :( 

Sometimes, I wonder if Jeff thinks about me. He didn't think about us whenever we were breaking up, when he wanted more time to ""think."" He didn't then, why would he now? I knew it. I was right when we got into that argument afterward. He didn't want to make an effort. He wants an effortless relationship because he's too damn selfish to think about anyone else except himself! It hurts for me to think this way about someone I claimed to have loved once upon a time. I don't love him. I don't.

My heart skips. I remember writing his name over and over in my journal trying to actualize him in the future. Excuse me. *A* future. In *A* future with me. Did not happen. I've tried so hard and it's hard to admit but...

<b>My love was in vain.</b> 

Nothing came of it. Wasted. It wasn't returned or appreciated. I should love a table more. It would serve more purpose to me. Steady without expectation. No obligation.

I caught myself daydreaming about Ed. @_@ That was weird. I don't think I'm completely over Jeff yet. But I'm not giving myself any deadlines anymore. I'll be completely over Jeff when I'm over him. Actually. I'm almost there. The idea of Jeff having sex with some other girl kinda makes me go ""Ew"" and ""What was I thinking?"" :) I'm on good with this getting over.

You know? I think I feel like I'm falling in love again. This time with being single and learning to love myself.  Not in a vain kind of way. In an accepting life for what it is kind of thing. It makes me happy.

I like the lounging bass beats breaking slow. I love classic rock. I'm falling in love with music. Starting over. Good things and good times. I feel like I shouldn't say that I'm over Jeff because then it's like admitting that you aren't because I still think about him. But that's not true entirely. I think it's my own progress with this that makes me think of it. He's not on my mind when I wake up or when I go to bed. He's just an inconvienent memory that pops up every now and then. 

He really made me unhappy. He wasn't good to me. It's just a part of life. I don't like who I became when I was around him. I started getting all pissy and shit all the time. Feeling like I was unworthy. I'm a good person, he just didn't see that.

He didn't see me for who I am. I tried to change for him too much. I don't like that. So long, Jeff. You've already lost your chance. I don't think I'd ever date him again. He can't be honest with his own feelings, how could he ever be honest with me? Jeff is bad news romantically. Heh. He always has been even when I tried to overlook it. I think he tried to warn me that he was a loser-boyfriend and I thought, ""Noo"" because that's not who I wanted him to be. I can't change him even if he changed me.

I'm going back to being real again. I'm going to be happy this time. 
We always like the wrong guys."

Man. I feel really weird. All day I've been twitching from nervousness and what not. I'm suffering from insomnia. I took some sleeping pills at like 10:30 and they aren't working. I don't know why they wouldn't work. Oh well. 

I feel like I'm in a Time Trap.
Do I want to save my mind?
Do I want to save my mind?
I could never know that in a time trap...

What is the source of all this anxiety?! I have no idea.

My Friends at OCU... they change me.

I have a great friend Grace. She has an amazing voice. I could listen to her talk all day. She's incredibly smart and very motivated. She makes me want to change the world. She's going somewhere.
I have a great friend Tabby. She makes me laugh so hard. We are a couple of weirdos. She hangs with some chill folk. Tabby is incredible, she's such an inspiration to her sisters and I'm so proud of her. Tabby is very level-headed. We're different but so alike. Tabby is hardcore goodness.
I love my boyfriend Jeff. I could write on and on how much he means to me right now in my life, but it'd get boring and everyone would think it mushy stuff. I love Jeff. I love being loved by Jeff, it's the best kind of love there is. 
I don't have a ""best"" friend. But one of them is my roomie. I can tell her anything. We have led similar lives. I've learned so much about Heather this past year. She's absolutely awesome. The best roommate ever. I decided that if I ever get married, she's going to be the maid of honor. She's helped me with Jeff so much and she always keeps my heart pointed in the right direction. Right back at Jeff. I'm so grateful for Heather being in my life. I love her like she was my sister. We really have the best times together in the dorm. Wal-mart. I wouldn't mind being roomies with Heather again next year. We would have a BLAST!
Emily is a great sister. We are so crazy when we get around each other. She's a great player and awesome sister. I feel like I can tell her anything. I love Emily! She keeps me in line too. Gosh, I have no idea where my head would be without all these people!
Jessica and I are like crazy indian twins. We are insane. Jessica and I clash on some things but for the most part, we had each other when we felt so alone. Jessica, I want the best to happen for her.

I don't know why I feel like writing about my friends. I could go on and on about some people and especially the ones that don't go to OCU. 

Oof. It's 1! 1 and I haven't fallen asleep yet! These pills are a ripoff. 

My head is full of readjusting. Coming down and then finding that reality is in the state of confusion is no fun.
Big bummer. 

I want to dye my hair or cut it... I want to change.

I think I've changed a lot in a year. I don't drink or smoke as much as I did last year. I quit smoking cigarettes for the most part. I sometimes wonder what people think of me changing so much. I don't know if I've moved for the better or worse. I feel shittier about myself, but at the same time, I'm glad I'm changing. I'm letting go and letting in."

I've been having strange dreams and this incredible disconnection from reality. Like, I have no idea what's going on and well... It kind of feels like time travel. Some things just naturally feel like a memory of the past and other things are just happening. It's a weird sensation.

I suppose it's what chemicals can do. I ran out of medicine. 

I'm still sick too. I feel like a non-thinker. For awhile there, I started having thoughts of suicide and tracing them like a diagram on some timeline of a map, I realized the end is nothing but a stressful new beginning. There is no end, no death. No easy relief, and it's not death I'm looking for... It's fulfillment of living. Feeling strangely like a distopian novel.

I started thinking of poetry again. I don't know if you know how much it makes me happy. I really miss writing. Writer's block depresses me greatly. I need inspiration and it's so hard to feel inspired if in evreything I find is a cyclic happening of redundancy. Yes yes yes. Circles goddamn IT, if there was ever the shape of god.

My head full of ""what she said.""

Just the thought of it is enough to penetrate my comfort zone.

My dad is supposed to visit me tomorrow. It's going to be wonderful to have some real food. Chelo kebob. My taste buds weep in joy everytime. I feel more free to write when I feel like no one is looking. Isn't it funny... this... feeling inside?

You know... it's not one I can easily hide. This journal is the closest to Laila I think I come in all of my writings.

I still have no light in my room. It's dark and disappointing.

Anyway. I had a dream last night that I had a baby. I was holding my baby and I told Sierra to watch her for a minute while I did something. While Sierra was holding the baby, Mark walked up and was acting crazy to her and she started crying. I got all sad that my baby was crying and it was like, all of a sudden I couldn't get to her. Like people were filling up the room and I had to shove them aside to get to the baby. When I got to her, Mark was red in the face screaming at me because the baby threw up. I started yelling at him that babies will do that, so just shut the fuck up. I wasn't really yelling though because I was holding the baby by then. Agh, and Sierra just started yelling that everyone should be quiet and she was watching TV. What an awful dream. Except for the fact about the baby. Oh man. Sometimes, it's just like... This is the right time to bring a baby in the world, if only I wasn't so... young and unstable. Oh yeah! Gary was in my dream too. He was being nice though and helping me out but he didn't really say anything, he was just... there. The dream happened at the old house. 

Another point in my dream last night, I was standing outside and I kept spitting out some disgusting stuff. Yeah, and I was in the car with some guy and we were looking at powerlines. He said it was stupid that ""they"" changed all the powerlines because now they will fall in the winter. I had no idea what he meant but I agreed anyway. I pointed out a metallic structure that ""they"" had built because the metal tower broke. I said it didn't do anything because all the wooden posts around the area were breaking in half, so all the powerlines dragged to the ground. It was weird. Then the guy and I drove around, and we saw a ""casino."" When we went inside, it was warm and he decided to play some poker. I started walking around and I saw someone that I used to know. I forgot who it was now, but in my dream I started following them. I remember I was really bored because the guy I was with just wanted to play poker. I went outside because I was going to leave, when I realized I was wearing someone else's jacket. I looked for a name and checked the pockets but found nothing. The tag read: One Size For All. I examined the jacket and clearly not all sizes could wear it. I wanted to see if it was true, so I laid the jacket on the car and waited for someone to pick it up. A wooden post broke, and I went back in the casino. I couldn't find the guy who was playing poker. 

That's it. 

Yeah, maybe he was the father of the baby? I have no idea. Only, I didn't really get the impression that we were together in the dream. It was like, this guy was just giving me a ride to someplace. I don't know. It was weird. Oh yeah! 

Some time in the dream, I was in the building with the big dead fish again. (Reoccuring dream)Giant giant giant fish. Only, all of the fish were dead. Even the ones in the tank. The elevator was rusty now. This time when I was in the building, I was all alone. I could hear the echos of people but no one was around, except the giant rotting corpses of the fish. :( I found the stairway."

Sometimes I honestly scare myself and I have no idea what the hell I am doing. Agh, I just get so angry and then I don't feel like talking about it anymore. It being whatever is bothering me. I repress it so much that the feeling stays but the reason doesn't. I'm so fucked up and it's hard to understand why. I feel like I'm not ready to be back in society again. I'm really fucking up my shit at school right now. I can hardly stand it. I keep telling myself that it's just because i don't like my classes. That might be part of it but I think this depression shit is really messing with my head too. It makes me not want to wake up and not go to sleep, makes me want to walk past my class and run away into forever. I want to disappear so I'm pushing away the only people who can save me. 
I feel like I need saving.

I don't know if I can handle doing this all on my own so sudden. I need money all the time and I am always needing someone... someone to love me unconditionally.

I feel like I am disappointing them. 

I used to have problems with not being able to cry. Now it seems I can't keep myself from crying. Even during class. Algebra, I'll look at my messy notes and things I've written while I was high in class and just realize what a waste I am. Such the fuck-up. All the time."

"event","Ahh. Just got out of the shower. I watched Envy and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. :) That was fun. I had the WEIRDEST dream last night. It was like I was in a war game and this monster was trying to break into my fort. I felt like I was pressing up down x x circle triangle but I knew that it was real. Suddenly, I had to get another ""player"" on my team to help me shut off the walls of the fort and turn a gigantic wheel that made a small circle in the middle of it sink in and a machine gun appear. 8D! Yeah. It was weird. 

Another part of my dream, I was talking to Ron. I gave him a hug and then he was trying to kiss me. It was sad but I kissed him back. This next part is mean but I don't care. Ron can't kiss. It's AWFUL. :( 

(stops to talk to Jeff)"

"event","I had something I wanted to talk about but now I'm not sure I'm ready to admit it. You know how those things are, when you are secretly in denial of an obvious fact and it hurts too much to admit it to yourself but you already know. Hopelessly hopeful.

Sometimes, it's just better to forget than go after something you know will just end in anger or sadness. I don't want things to be this way. I'm not going to pretend like everything is fine because it's not. But I'm not sad, I know I'm angry. I'm indifferent. Apathy extravaganza! Trust is too hard to come by. I feel like I am too trusting of people and when it gets broken I overreact. I know people aren't trustworthy. There is no one but myself. I hate that. Yet, I know it's true. 

I can't think of a person who hasn't in one way or another disappointed me. I'm not wanting everyone to be perfect all the time. I'm not faultless. I'm the worst person I know of... I hate it when I see qualities in other people that I recognize in myself. Things I hate. Things I want to change. It's a shame. I guess it's these things that make me feel connected with people. I don't want that.

Sometimes I scare myself that really I am optimistic.

Man this post is so emo. Just like this journal. Yeah. 

Jocko said no when I came back last time 
It's lookin' like I lost a friend 
No use callin' 'cause the sky is fallin' 
And I'm gettin' pretty near the end 
A smoke-filled room in a corner basement 
The situation must be right 
A bag o' goodies and a bottle o' wine 
We're gonna get it on right tonight"

Ok so I've been extra moody because of all the stress. I'm so normal, people! You don't even know! Alright! Alright! Here's my fist, where's the fight?! Alright! Alright! 

Mr. Anderson was my sub in Calculus today. It was so weird. It's like I knew him but... yeah.

At lunch, Kenny sat with us and we started talking about Republicans and Democrats and Coal started rambling on about Iraq... It was interesting. Eric came to school today... I felt so lost without him. I couldn't go ""eri-eri-eric!"" :( oh well. Hehe. Today was so fun. I'm so excite. Thursday has become the new Friday. :) And then there is still Friday. Exciting! Positively awesome!

My hair all done up in strands of blue, green, and gold. :) I want to be a karma chameleon... I'll need to be red, gold, and green though. 

Lizzy is doing her English... like a neeerd. Oh well. I'm so awesome! I'm so cool! I'm so green! I'm so rockin'! I'm so ego!


MY ID MY ID! I want to scream my lines over and over. I'm too afraid of shouting in anyone's ears...


I'm a good student. I don't do drugs. I am not a ""public good."" I'm well-rounded. I'm artistic. I'm fun. I'm so happy right now. This moment. 


Until that is... my neck starts itching. Hehe. Weeeeeeeird. Red gold and green. Red gold and greeeeeen. Oh no.

I have until 3:30 until Ron gets here."

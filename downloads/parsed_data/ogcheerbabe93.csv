Well yesterday, I had to cheer at 2 basketball games in a row, and then me and Lindsey went to the lock-in at the church. We stayed up all night long. It was so fun. Me, Lindsey, Kendyl,&nbsp;and some girl named Laura ran around the church and played for so long. Then Blake came in our room and started bugging us, so we kicked him out. It was fun!! lol! Then, 2 other guys came in our room and messed with our stuff and it made me SO mad. Then, we all played 007 and I didn't win. ( In&nbsp;case you don't know what 007 is: It is where you turn off all the lights and hide and 5 people come and find u with a flashlight and if u get tagged with the flashlight, your out.) After that, we ate Krystals and went back up to the room and did more stuff the rest of the night, but I came remeber it all. Then today, Lindsey's mom came and got us and we went back to Lindsey's house and slept until 2:00. When we woke up, we had lunch for breakfast! Lol It was good.&nbsp; And later on, we went to Fred's and Shoe Dept. Well I am very tired so I'll ttyl</STRONG></FONT></P>

All that happened that was semi-exiting was we had this thingy where we went out to the football field and watched the marching band do a show thingy. They did real good. I still think they should have let the cheerleaders do something though. Oh well. Other than it being extremely boring,it was a pretty good day. Me and Breanna aren't mad anymore. Me and Lindsey are still mad though. Oh well I don't really care cause she has no reason to be mad. I had a baked potatoe and soup for dinner tonight. It was yummy. OMG! I am so upset! Ms. Rheuby isn't gonna be our cheerleading coach next year! WAA! I love Ms. Rheuby! I don't want her to go! The new coach is gonna be mean ol' Ms. Parker. GRRRR... I don't like her!

"event","soooooo.. i've narrowed my choices for the english project down to two!<br /><br /><strong>BLOG</strong> - basically i have to comment on each of the major units we've covered since september on a xanga or whatever in ""a lucid and original way""<br /><strong>POETRY</strong> - write 10 original war-themed poems with the audience being servicemen in the US Army fighting in Iraq<br /><br />i think that the poems is, if you look at it, kinda easy. i mean, poetry can be however long or short you want it to be right? so i can practically BS the whole thing and still get a good grade, or not, because it's all based on interpretation. blogging would take up a lot more time in comparison. however, blogging fits more into <strong><u>m</u>y<u> lifest</u>y<u>le</u></strong>. i mean, i don't mind blogging and rambling about my thoughts on certain things. i also have somewhat of an idea of how i'd portray each section that we've covered. going more into depth about my thoughts on these things.. for the poems, i don't know if i can <strong>really </strong>BS the whole thing because i don't really have a perspective on war or what it's like for the army. and i guess if i chose that project that's part of the work that's needed - to research army life and what not. also, i don't know how much material i would have for <strong>ten poems</strong>. really the only experience of war that i have is that with my parents lol. so yeah. i need help. please help me."

"event","soooo.. for josan, i'm updating! be happy =p also, i'm bored and waiting for the time to pass. why, you may i ask? hahaha i'll tell you why eventually..<br />wow, i really haven't logged in here in the longest time. the layout is so crappy T____T i <strong>must</strong> change it.. eventually..<br />spring break has not felt like a break at all. i've been busy busy busy. i really don't even remember much of what happened last week. it feels like it's been so long ago!<br /><br /><strong>April 17, 2006<br /></strong>9:30 - 12:30 driving classes<br />yes, driving classes, my dears because i've been a bum and haven't taken them yet. so, yay for driving around newark and maplewood lol<br /><br /><strong>April 18, 2006<br /></strong><em>COLUMBIA COLLEGE VISIT</em><br />my goodness, Columbia is so amazingly beautiful. i went with kristine and our moms. the ride there was spent with mostly our moms talking about random stuff but as soon as we got into new york the scenery was just.. wow..<br />the info-session and tour made me want to go to Columbia sooooo badly, however, my grades and requirements probably won't make the cut. i can still dream, right? i'm unsure of whether or not i should apply early decision to Columbia or NYU. i guess it all depends on how the NYU visit goes..<br />anyway, our tour was a chibi filipina. she was from TX and was very thorough and informative throughout the tour. the place was very college-y and i &lt;3 it.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>April 19, 2006<br /></strong><em>SETON HALL COLLEGE VISIT</em><br />my mom and i went on the 10:00 am info-session and tour to Seton Hall. it's an okay school and i guess it's more of a likely school for me. apparently it's really easy to commute from Seton to NYC so it'd be okay if i wanted some internships in the city etc. they had a speech-language pathologist booth towards the end of the tour and i totally signed up for information. ever since stanko's girlfriend visited our linguistics class i've been inclined to take speech-language pathology as my major. according to.. i forgot her name, so i'll just call her mrs. stanko lol.. anyway, according to her, Kean, Seton Hall, TCNJ, and i think Montclair State have good speech-language pathology courses. i think she mentioned Rutgers did, too, but i don't remember. and apparently the NYU SLP course isn't as good as the others because that's where they place the rejects from the other schools.. but hey, if i suck that much maybe i <strong>will </strong>get into NYU because of that. hah...<br />after the Seton Hall visit my mom and i went to UMDNJ to drop of keys for my idiot dad who locked his own in the car. -_- we stayed there for lunch and i had sushi and a fruit cup. on my way out of there i saw a sign that lead to ""speech-language pathology"" and pointed it out to my mom who was skeptical about SLP being a successful or popular job etc. so she's going to ask around the hospital about how much speech-language pathologists get and what not when she goes back to work.<br /><br /><em>start chem homework?</em><br />HAHAHA, that was funny. my plan with kristine was to go out to the movies and stuff. sooo, as an excuse i'd go to her house then we'd go out. so much for that. it seems like a lot of my plans to hang out with people have been thwarted all this week. ahh well. when i got home from UMD i asked my mom if i could go to kristine's house to do chem hw [ which i intended to start there ]. so around 5 or 6 i went and ended up not even looking at chem. first, i was helping kris stuff boxes for her party favors. then, it was getting hot in her room so i suggested we go to magic fountain and invite victor, too, lol. so kristine and i left and waited for victor at her bro's hwa rang do school across the street. damn, matt's so into the whole thing compared to kris' bro who was yawning during the 10 minute dance workout. kris and i met this korean girl, master yum's niece, kristine or christine. master yum said that she's on the PGA tour and i was wondering if she was that amazing asian golfer girl on TV. she <strong>did</strong> look like her... i don't know her name though, so yeah.<br />well, eventually victor came an hour later so we went to magic fountain and got our usuals. kris' mom called and asked when we were going to come back and kris told her that victor just got there. lol, kris' mom is soooo funny.. nakakatuwa siya. i wish i had a mom that approved of my guy friends and was humorous about the whole guy situation. eventually, all of us, kris, me, rj, and victor went back to kris' house. tita marge asked me to play the piano and i pushed on that victor was so much better than me [ really, he is... ]. so tita marge tells victor to play for her so she can judge if he's worthy or not lol. victor plays and blows her off while she complains that kris and i don't practice enough. so kris and i attempt to play our duet from last year's recital and embarrass ourselves horribly. basically we all just had a mini-piano concert for kris' mom until i left. *sigh* they're so cute. while i was playing tita marge, kris, and victor were sitting on the couch together and it was just..&nbsp; awww.. my mom's so not cool -_-<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>April 20, 2006<br /></strong>10:00 - 1:00 driving classes<br />yay!! i finally got my permit!! i practiced for maybe 2 hours at i think Weequahic Park in newark parallel parking and k-turning. ugh.. i got so hot and sweaty from the nervousness and the heat. i feel accomplished though, so that's good =)<br /><br />2:00 - 5:00 calc/chem homework @ westfield library<br />so christina and i decided to meet up at WML to attempt homework and what not. we started doing calc and we were going along well doing our 45 minute practice AP test. then we lost all hope of ever passing calc and went on to chem. well, eventually we just gave up and just talked. heh.. the mafia's name <strong>should</strong> probably changed to the ""azn heartbreakers"". we're awesome. yes.<br />christina left around 5 and i waited for my mom. she came and let me drive us home ^__^&nbsp; yayness. i was excited. and nervous. my mom said i was good!! so i drove us to and from the chapel later on as well and did a good job again!! i'm so exicted to drive now lol. i wouldn't mind going out with her now as long as i can drive. teeheehee.<br /><strong><br />April 21, 2006<br /></strong>soooo.. finally to today!! i woke up at about 6 and couldn't go back to sleep because i'm so excited! today i'm visiting NYU with my mom, christina, and rob. christina's picking my mom and me up and dropping us off at the elizabeth station at around 9:00 am and hopefully we'll meet rob from his linden train at 9:22. i've been planning this for soooo long and it's finally come! well, first we're going to visit Fordham for the 10:00 info-session and tour then hopefully catch the 2:30 NYU info-session and tour. my mom tried to reserve spots for us around last week but the NYU people said that all of their info-sessions were booked for this week. so originally we were just gonna meet up with one of my friend's from there and she'd tour us around. but then rob told me that ariyan visited without having registered for the specific date he visited and it was okay. so late last night i went online and signed us all up for the info-session on monday just in case lol. so yeah, we're gonna try to go to the info-session at 2:30 - 4:30 and at around 5 we'll meet up with becky, my pingry buddayy! we'll probably get back home late at night..<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>April 22, 2006</strong><br />hmm.. i really don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. well, if all goes according to plan today i'll be able to go to the Yankee game with rob, kris, and victor. lol, i don't know how <strong>that's</strong> gonna work out but i hope it will.. i've been looking forward to this all break. *sigh*<br /><br />so yeah, that's my spring break!! so busy.. i really haven't gotten much rest. i've been watching naruto probably almost every day and i'm still only on episode 101! rawrr i'm so far behind compared to alaa and josan. here are just some future dates i'm looking forward to..<br /><strong>April 29, 2006</strong> - Sakura Matsuri [ Cherry Blossom Festival ] @ Brooklyn Botanic Garden<br /><strong>May 13, 2006 </strong>- multi-cultural fair! look for me at the bubble tea booth with kirk and tara!! i'm gonna be making some really sweet bubble tea =)<br /><strong>June 16 - 18, 2006</strong> - animeNEXT with EVERYONE lol<br /><br />yeah, those are the only major things i could think of so far.. i think they're the only things that can get me through the rest of the school year. i might be taking an EMT course at the Clark Volunteer Squad over the summer if my mom'll let me. so yay for community service hours!<br /><br />well i should really get going and take a shower since it's been an hour since i've started writing this crap. bye bye for now!!"

<P>so life's really been treating me fairly nowadays. school has been way too much of a hassle and i feel like i just died today. there's just way too much crap teachers are piling up on us and it's only the beginning of the marking period! i hate my physics group, no offense. i feel like i did so much during that period without much help. it gave me such a bad headache that i couldn't study for the english test. grawr. thankfully i'm going on that french/spanish club trip tomorrow. i can't take another day of school!</p><p>i've been so much more active in church right now and i'm happy about it. i still feel kinda left out with everyone else. last night was so bad for me emotionally. at MGEM practice kim brought in the scrapbook she made for kai and i was just wishing i had friends like that. close close friends like kai. they were together since they were little kids but that's only a dream of mine. i haven't had any really close friends that i can completely trust and turn to and that my parents approve of either. even in that horoscope email thing it said that the number of real close friends i have in my lifetime would only be six. that's true i guess, but i really need just someone to understand me completely right now. but what can i do? all i <b><i>can</b></i> do is to turn to God to comfort me.</P>"

"event","mango..first snow of the season. =DDD so pretty yet so freakishly annoying. let's see..i left school at 3 and got home around 5:45. yurp..well, we had a few stop overs. julia came with me luckily. if she didn't she wouldn't have gotten a ride home cuz i heard that the hillside bus never came to votech/magnet. crap..that sucks..we went on route 22 cuz my dad wanted to buy a new shovel. we passed by blinds to go to pick up our blinds and then we went to home depot and walmart but no shovel!! mango..sucks. mommy also wanted me to buy her gloves but i couldn't find the ones she wanted!! they were all expensive and ugly-ish and there wasn't that great of a selection at walmart. we took a 'shortcut' home cuz 22 was really traffic-y but we were stuck there for about 30ish minutes. turns out there were two accidents on the way home.

dropped of julia and went home. good news though!!..kinda..all my plans for this weekend are cancelled due to the snow!! so my weekend's NOT booked! general choir practice was cancelled for today, sadly..first <b>ever</b> general practice cancelled..my voice concert tomorrow is cancelled as well as my piano recital on sunday. yay!!! i'm freeeeee!!! ohh yeah, maude, i've been trying to call you about it!!! anyway, i'll possibly go to the movies with christina tomorrow if she didn't change her mind. if not, maybe with kristine?? yeahh..watch HONEY!! jessica alba =DDD

pretty pretty snow. first snow of the season. beautiful. luckily i dressed for the occasion. someone reminded me about it too =) yup, i was ready!! wore my scarf, insulated windbreakers, and timbs!! so totally ready!!

wow, can you believe it?! hahaha..mann..
there's so much going on. everything's
big but it's all going by so fast that i just
don't have the time to let it sink into my
head..

so many things are happening. there's so
much here swirling in my head. i've been
talking to dar a lot lately..kinda. we have 
good chats. even if they're serious we always
have something to laugh about. and we almost
always usually end on a happy note..like last
night. we spread our thoughts on life, about
our past, it was good. i felt lighter a bit, i really
needed it too. she helped me get my mind out
of all the things that i was worrying about.
thanks, dar! =)

now i'm talking to glenn. mann..he's so smart
and talented..he has so much love to give! haha..
spread the love, glenn!  we don't really know
each other but we've got the basics down..we've
already had some good convos and he's already
watching over me,  how sweet..mann..he better
visit next summer! our brief meeting was so
blurred last time..just for a minute..yeah, we
better chill next summer!

goin to philly tomorrow! i think it'll be okay..
my mom's goin as a 'chaperone' hehe..yeah
they needed a nurse just in case something
happens to us kids. my mom was all talking
about making her own personalized first aid
kit..lol it's gonna be cool. even though i have
the two teachers i don't really like as my other
chaperones. i'ma stick with my mommy! yeah,
her, christina, and maude. brigesh and vaidehi
are in my group too. our group rocks! if only we
had arakelian and sanservino though.. =( ohh
well, we'll make the best of it, right? =)

do i seem superficial to you? i'm so vague about
so many things. it always looks like i'm happy and
so optimistic, right? what's beyond this exterior
of mine? am i hurting? am i sad? sometimes i
ask myself the same question. am i just pretending
to be strong for the benefit of others? that's how
i feel sometimes..but then when i pretend to be
happy and eventually make them happy, i get happy
too. so i guess it's a good thing..maybe.."

yes, i actually am. i'm in the mmc almost
every day. and then i have tech every mon,
wed, fri. then i go online every day for
at least two hours after school or whenever.
it's getting pretty boring. i have things
to do but i'm getting bored of going on
the internet..i'm online too much. i should
limit myself. damn, what the hell is wrong

i'm in the mmc. i've been here
since fitness class. we didn't go
out cuz of the rain. we made soccer
plays. it was pretty stupid crap.

i woke up late today. i thought
i alarmed for 6a but it was 6p so
i woke up at 7 and yeahh rushed to
finish my english homework. i didn't
read anythin and i had to answer those
stupid questions. i was late for school
and class and we didn't have to bring
in the questions!! grr..but o well. i
wasn't marked late cuz i took a bus pass
lol..i don't take the bus but yeah, i
just nodded when the lady asked me and
this bunch of people near me too.

i'm hungry. that's okay. i'll eat during
lunch. i think. umm yeahhhh. last night
was cool. i got closer to some people and
yeah, found out the truth about a lot of
clandestine problems between us and other
people. i was so optimistic last night
even though i ended up crying some times.
i don't know, maybe it's the fact that i
try so hard and actually got something
back and it felt good..it feels good to
know that i make a difference in their
lives and i somehow impact them..hopefully
things will continue to go on and our
bonds will be stronger. our dreams can come
true, my hopes and wishes too..and hopefully
things can change for the better..

it's the simple things that make
life so wonderful.."

i think the only teacher that i can actually kinda tolerate is ms. arakelian. she's nice and stuff and i can tolerate her. my other teachers are umm, weird? i dunno..history? mr. sanservino hasn't really said or done much to make me like him. the fitness teachers are okay, but i don't really talk to them and they just tell us what to do and how to do it. mme. schwalje nice and stuff, but she talks too much in french for me to actually get what she's saying. mrs. green-parkes is okay, but she's kinda strict. mrs. weisgerber is too lenient and soft-spoken. mr. mariano is just flat out disgusting. he thinks he's all that and whatever. he's young, too young. and he's such a perv and sooooo unfair. always flirting with girls and whatever. he was flirting with this girl in my class and was doing basically her whole project for her. mann, that's not right. and maude said that he also checks out this other girl in her class. eww..that's just disgusting. ms. marcello looks like ray's wife in everybody loves ramond..kinda, not really..but yeah. she 'seems' nice, but she can get a bit mean and maybe biotchy. well that's the basic analysis of my teachers.

two days to do it and all cuz of the
block A and B schedule.

my butt hurts. i kicked it hard
during soccer drills in fitness.
they told me to! so yeah..i did..
and now it hurts..and same with
my legs and thighs..oww..

now that i've switched to french III i
had to switch to another geo/trig class.
kirk's in my class..as well as sharissa's
brother, mark..and some other sophs in
my french III class. i met a lot of people
but i mainly hang out with christina and
sit with her, kristine, danny, sam, nidhi,
maude, and paulina during lunch. i went
with sam to the bathroom n she got stuck
in the stall haha..i had to kick it open lol.
during lunch yesterday, someone, i forget
if it was nidhi or maude..or both of them..
well, anyway, they said that christina,
me, sam, and kristine were all like
quadruplets..cuz we were sitting all
next to each other and yeah..
dunno, some guy thought me and
christina were twins..but like yeah, she's
chinese and i'm filipina..no duhh..dunno,
it's weird..

i'm still awake. hehe. what the
heck am i doing? ohh yeah =)"

sitting in the same class
for an hour and 20 minutes..
stupid block schedule.

i'm taking french III. it's
final. i switched it with my
geo/trig class period. my
brain hurt..they were way
too advanced and me and
christina where like..uhh??
but i guess we'll catch up..
hopefully. there are supposed
to be more french III transfer
people. like two more i think..
christina and i still have the
same identical schedule. =)

i have a class with julia!!! yay
she's in my fitness/health class
with the other juniors.. ohh yeah,
roanne, i met katrina!! and
i don't think she knows me cuz she
asked about my 'brother' and i
don't have one..so yeah..

and dar..maude says hi and
that she doesn't know you but
has heard of you.

too much homework..at
least it's long term, then again
i procrastinate too much..
tsk tsk on me."

today was fun. we only had two blocks and then a meeting then free until the end of the day!!! woohoo!! that rocked..we [froshes] were supposed to get our ID pics taken today but we were 'having too much fun' and they didn't wanna interrupt us. it wasn't really eventful..i just got to know some ppl better and yeah..sam n danny..i met nidhi and maude and other ppl. kristine n sam were askin danny why he's always surrounded by asian girls lol..cuz yeah, in the auditorium sam and kristine were on his left and me n christina were on his right. lol..yeahh and he's all 'pimp' like..and not even asian. ohh welpz, i guess union ppl rub off on the asians that live there hehe..

"event","<font face=""arial"">wow..people are really depressed or getting depressed lately. i look at some of my friends' xangas or ljs and it's all about depression, sadness, pain. i feel so bad for them, but i don't know what to do. i don't know what words to say or if it'll even help them at all. i was kinda lucky to have gone through my depression stage with some of my friends behind me. 'the journal' if anyone gets that..but i guess i kinda passed that stage of depression in this part of my life..everyone with 'the journal' got through it..and i think we're better people know. we're stronger and used to being disappointed and sad. i just got tired of hating myself for certain things that happened in the past and despising myself for my qualities that i disliked. i'm so tired of complaining about life. i remembered that i would push people away when i got depressed. i never wanted anyone to know how i felt and because of that, i missed out on so much. 

i remember there was just so much depression at one point that i kept on thinking about taking away my life. i felt so alone, like no one was there for me, but it was my own fault. i pushed them away. and now i know that suicide is not right. God gave us life and it was his gift unto us and we shouldn't take it for granted. there are so many people that i've seen, heard, or read about, that couldn't continue carrying on. it's sad really, the various stories of how and why they decided to end their lives..they don't know what's out there. they can't see the beauty of life behind their own shadows of the past and present. they live only now and they can't see dreams come true. 

after pessimism came optimism for me. i try not to dwell in the past anymore. it's my past, everyone's haunted by their past, but just because it happened, it doesn't mean that it can haunt you forever. people can change their present and look to a better future. sounds stupid, i know, but it's true.."

"event","so i went to levinn's party. it
was fun. i actually went out
and did something i wanted to
do. sucks i couldn't sleepover
but that's okay. yeah, when
my dad realized that it was only
me, heather, and elisabeth
there he said if he had known
i could have slept over. blehh..
but it's okay. yeah, if i did, i
wouldn't have been able to do
some stuff this morning.

that's the first time i've seen
them since the last day of
school..it's the first time i've
seen anyone from pingry since
then. they talked a lot about
their teachers and classes and
heather and elisabeth talked a lot
about their camp, but their
stories were very amusing.

when i first got there, we
were in levinn's room and
looking at some old emails
and stories they wrote..
we saw levinn's school
books and then i just had
the sudden urge to sing
our song lol ""je suis un chien
[ouaf ouaf]"" fun fun fun

the pool/hot tub was fun lol.
the hot tub especially..they
[heather and elisabeth] were
singing ""two ladies...two ladies..
and i'm the only mannn!!"" haha..
in the pool, we kept on flipping
each other over and fighting
for the two rafts. i got flipped
like a billion times. we also
tried making a whirlpool in her
hot tub but it was too small and
we kept on freakin bumping into
each other or the sides of the tub.
steam!! it looked like we were in a
cauldron or something. tres awesome.

after we got out of the pool
we ate ice cream bday cake..
and mutilated it lol. veryy yummy.
for some reason, i just had
the sudden urge to sing ""don't
touch my birdie""..so i did..
only the chorus though, and
they freaked out lol..""just call
it..and it will comeee""

all in all, i had fun. i am
soooo glad i wasn't stuck
watching the VMAs all night.

"event","i wrote a short story. i
really like it actually, but
it's just too revealing. it
says too much about my
life and it's way to obvious
that something like it has
happened to me. i don't
really want a stranger to
know something so deep
about me..especially not
a teacher. so i guess i'm
gonna keep it for myself
and my own pleasure. i'll
write another one that's
not as revealing as this
one is. i'm really proud
of what i wrote though..

anyway, does anyone remember
son by four and their song,
""the purest of pain""? well, yeah
i was going through the cd my
kuya chad and i burned together
and it came to that song. i just
remembered when it was still
popular and was way overplayed
on the radio. after a while
it was gone. but it's really
a beautiful song.."

"event","i've been thinking a lot about my name description from kabalarians:
[here's what it said..just in case you don't want to look all the way down to the entry]
>>The name of Steffanie has created a congenial nature with the desire to associate in friendship and understanding both socially and in the business world. Peaceful and settled conditions appeal to you and you are naturally desirous of having the security of a home, where your life could follow a definite pattern, and where you would not have to make major decisions. You find it difficult to take a definite stand, partly because you lack confidence, and also because you dislike any issues which create dissension between people. Procrastination is a weakness of your nature, causing an inability always to complete your plans or to concentrate for long. You need to see a concept presented completely in detail before you can understand it, and if you cannot understand it, you come to your own conclusion and often fail to listen to and reason out another's point of view. You resist being forced into change and could become almost impervious to new ideas. You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood. Your name has given you a desire for heavy, rich foods, which cause sluggish digestion. You could suffer with constipation, stomach, or intestinal disorders, or disturbances in the fluid functions of the body.<<
i think the whole thing is practically true. i like to make friends 'both socially and in the business world.' and about 'peaceful and settled conditions' and 'the security of a home,' that is true too. i don't like it when people argue [""you dislike any issues which create dissension between people""], especially my parents. i can't stand it when they yell at each other. when i grow up and start my own family, i seriously imagine myself with a filipino man..someone, preferably, who grew up in the philippines and knows tagalog. i love my culture and i want to pass it down to my own children and remind them of their roots so that they'll be proud to be who they are.
i do lack confidence in myself and i'm afraid to make decisions on my own. if a question is asked in class and i'm unsure of the answer, i just don't answer at all. i don't feel confident that i might know it and then i get ashamed if i'm wrong.
the part about procrastination is way on too. i usually finish my assignments for school and piano at the last minute and the part about trouble understanding new concepts..i mean WOW. i hate change, i shouldn't, but i do..or at least i try to keep things the same. i resist it, same thing. i can deal with it and everything-death, people entering and leaving my life, being in different environments-but before i can deal with it, i worry about it. i dread the day it comes, but after it passes, it doesn't bother me much..i just usually try to avoid it i guess because i want to avoid the pain of knowing that what i'm used to might be gone.
no one understands me really..and that's right. i can only think of maybe a handful of people who might understand why i do what i do, say what i say, etc. but still, they don't know so many things about me. i usually find myself being the consoler rather than the speaker. it's also hard for me to trust someone until they trust me. i get close to people by them first opening up to me that kinda goes with the appreciation part. they appreciate me because they trust me with how they feel and rely on me. i don't know why it's that way, but that's the way it happens. i don't really approve of it cuz the relationship between two friends shouldn't be like that, but it's like that with me. if they open up to me, i might just open up to them little by little. i guess i also fear the pain of being teased or betrayed by unreliable people.
dang..this thing is getting me depressed. i need to stop thinking, but my mind is just so stubborn..it can't stop. all these things bother me so much. whenever i feel like this and have so much on my mind, i want to tell someone, but then this usually occurs when no one is really available. next time i get the opportunity to talk to someone, the feeling passes and i back out on spilling out my past feelings. i'm also afraid to pass my burdens to other people while they have their own problems to tend to..so i continue going on my own..alone.."

"event","chinatown was wayy fun =) after my mom
got a facial, we went shopping! lol..what else?
actually..a lot else, but yeah. my mom didn't bring
enough cash and she didn't wanna use her credit
card so i ended up paying for a lot of stuff. we didn't
really buy much and stay long cuz she had to go to work.
i saw this t-shirt that said 'i survived the blackout: new york
august 14, 2003' i wanted to buy it, but yeah..didn't bring
enough cash. anyway, we're goin back next monday, or
at least she is, but i am sooo gonna persuade
her to bring me.

we bought the things we really needed. kinda..
i bought a cute lil flower bag and a chinese
shirt for church. both of them added up to $40
altogether after my mom did some haggling.
that's the way filipinos do it hehe. we also bought
a souvenir for my kuya chad in the philippines.
i hope he likes it. i spent most of my money though,
on my ate leah's bday gift. we bought her a jade
pendant for $60 after a lot a lot a lot of haggling
and then the saleswoman said that she'd sell me
this flip flop pendant and chain for $40 if i come
back. she's a good saleswoman. lol.

anyway, it was fun..short, too short, but fun."

Omg people want to be you.

and is that who i think it is in the pic up there?
<b>//edit</b> that <b>is</b> who i thought it was..

and didn't feel like going to my piano lesson
 early in the morning. i went anyway
and ms. anna opens the door and asks
me to stay until 12 cuz dreem couldn't come to teach.
just my luck right? i wanted to go home right after and sleep!!
yeah, anyway i got $20 for teaching an hour and a half after
i had my own lesson. not bad...good pay. yeah, but i still felt like crap..because
stupid me, it's that stupid time of the month. oh joy! when i got home
i didn't feel like sleeping anymore so i took a nice, long, relaxing bubble bath.
my highlight of the day. yay! =) afterwards, i went online and talked to

"event","tomorrow's parents' night sponsored by the kadiwa and binhi. and guess what the theme is..western. as in texas type clothes, cowboy hats, boots, dirty denim etc. what a coincidence right? x_O

the blackout was annoying. my food's spoiled and my ice cream's melted! *cries* i talked to aileen for most of it anyway, so it wasn't soooo bad. we were talkin bout the blackout being like a nationwide lockdown. and complaining and everything..and about high school. magnet might shut down. rumors have been going around that they don't have enough money to keep the school going. it's only paid by taxes and i don't think that's enough to keep a highly technical and developed school running for a long period of time.

updated webshots by the way. my scanner sucks. i can't wait to get a new comp or laptop. still need a digi cam so it's easier to send pics to my relatives in philippines. lucky them..they have one. they are soooo much more advanced than i am. with their new computer with 3000+ songs downloaded onto winamp and their built in cd burner..and their digi cam. i'm kinda thinking attending college there might be nice. especially if i don't get into ivy league. don't really wanna get into one but my parents are gonna force me to apply. i can see it now. it's way cheaper there and i'll get to know my family more. silliman seems like a nice college. if i go there for four years i most definitely am gonna know more tagalog and bisaya..and my auntie promised that she'd buy me my own motorcycle if i go to college there! that's a definite plus. i miss riding soooo much *sniffles* and driving..*sigh* i miss all the coconut plantations that i might own in the future..i seriously don't know what to do after high school. what i do decides who i'll be for the rest of my life. i'm being way too pessimistic of the future. gotta have some optimism, right?"

"event","i was reading something about ffx-2 when i came across a definition of the name lenne/ren..a character in ffx-2. it had a link to this name definer website and i entered my name and some of my friends' names..it's sometimes so accurate it's freaky..

The name of Steffanie has created a congenial nature with the desire to associate in friendship and understanding both socially and in the business world. Peaceful and settled conditions appeal to you and you are naturally desirous of having the security of a home, where your life could follow a definite pattern, and where you would not have to make major decisions. You find it difficult to take a definite stand, partly because you lack confidence, and also because you dislike any issues which create dissension between people. Procrastination is a weakness of your nature, causing an inability always to complete your plans or to concentrate for long. You need to see a concept presented completely in detail before you can understand it, and if you cannot understand it, you come to your own conclusion and often fail to listen to and reason out another's point of view. You resist being forced into change and could become almost impervious to new ideas. You desire refinement, understanding, and appreciation, yet sometimes your outward attitude does not reveal your innermost feelings, and thus you have never felt truly understood. Your name has given you a desire for heavy, rich foods, which cause sluggish digestion. You could suffer with constipation, stomach, or intestinal disorders, or disturbances in the fluid functions of the body.

a lot of that is really true..it's freaky. i think i scared dar, j.i., and jill with theirs..here's some of their name descriptions: 
(p.s. sorry j.i...i didn't put yours cuz they don't have the correct spelling for it..lol 'jhun')

<lj-cut text=""friend descriptions"">
<b>darlene</b>
Your name of Darlene creates an intense desire for association with people and new experiences, many of which have been rather bitter. This name has given you a gregarious personality and a quick-thinking, creative, and versatile nature, but one that is unstable emotionally. You desire change and travel and would enjoy opportunities that allowed you to be creative and to act independently, rather than to conform to system and routine. However, this name does not allow you to complete your undertakings, as farther fields always look greener. Although you may appear confident and positive, you actually lack confidence and feel self-conscious at times. This name spoils patience and depth of thought, and weakens your stand in matters of principle. You are too open to suggestion, and thus you could become involved in detrimental associations which could lead you into by-paths of thrill-seeking or emotional indulgence. Any weakness in your health would appear in the fluid functions as kidney, bladder, or circulatory problems. or in a sensitivity affecting your stomach.

<b>jillian</b>
Your first name of Jillian has made you a hard worker with a meticulous sense of detail. You have a great deal of patience and independence, and you can be relied upon to complete your undertakings. You are stable, trustworthy, homeloving, and logical in practical matters, but rather unresponsive to suggestions from others. You resist change. This name does not give you great ambitions, vision, or imagination. It frustrates the expression of your softer, feminine qualities in that you find it difficult to express the depth of your feelings for those you love. It limits you to practical matters of the day, filling your life with detailed routine. hard work, and monotony. Weaknesses in the health could affect the intestinal organs, causing growths, ulcers, constipation, or glandular conditions. Problems from head tension affecting the eyes, ears, sinuses, or teeth could arise. 

<b>nataniel</b>
The name of Nataniel creates a quiet, systematic, and technical nature and a clever, inventive mind, attentive to detail. You are attracted to working outdoors in nature, where you would experience the peace and serenity you so much desire. You would find electricity, electronics, and similar technical fields of interest, as well as computer, mathematical, and scientific studies. You are inclined to be quiet, reserved, patient, and conservative, preferring to test and prove everything to your own satisfaction before committing yourself. You like to finish what you start without interruptions, and also to have everything in its place and properly organized. You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing turmoil and unhappiness. Finding it difficult to join in light conversation with those with whom you are not well acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative. As a result, you seem aloof. Your limited verbal expression--except with those involved in your field of interest--makes it difficult for you to communicate your deeper thoughts even to those closest to you. Friendships and personal association are accordingly restricted, as well as business success, because you are over-cautious in venturing into financial risks or promotional effort. You could experience sensitivity in your heart, lungs, and bronchial organs, and also suffer from constipation or other ailments affecting the intestinal tract.

play practice sucks. it's not like anyone's gonna like it anyway. and i don't get why everyone thinks my scene is good. she effin made me do a pelvic thrust!! and seriously, i don't think that's entertaining.
mr. bowes is so stupid. i seriously don't know why he's a teacher. he's so bad at it and its just not right for teachers to act gay by wearing pink pants and flowered ties..and acting like Ngo Ding Diem walking through rice fields while greeting vietnamese rice workers...and like today, playing a recorder while pretending to be a soldier. OMG, i can't stand it anymore!
well tomorrow is the first annual DuBourg concert. so i have to stay at school for about 12 hours. friday's the teaser for alice and wonderland and saturday we have a seven hour rehearsal..again x_O i can't wait until summer.
i hope i'll be able to go cuz of the SARS issue. and i hope i can see ate gladys again."

fuck u contacts. okay lah, maybe i didnt wash properly. but i have sth called the cornea ulcer. ): it's so fucking painful that i cannot even stare directly at the light. or rather, i cannot even open my eyes. ): went to the doctor the first day, doctor said 'aiyo. cornea ulcer. if gets bigger, need to hospitalized. actually ur left eye also kenna already. only that yr right eye is so bad, u cant feel anything on ur left eye.' 

that night, couldnt take it, went to a&amp;e. doctor said to be hospitalized, but no bed. so he said, put eye drops every 20mins like that throughout the whole night next morning, go see him again. my parents didnt even sleep. haha. they stayed in the room with me to wake me up every 20mins to apply the eye drops.

oh, HAHA. and i sms u to receive a 'who u huh?' reply. great. simply great. my heart broke and was 20 times more painful than my eyes. so u returned the number back to ur manager? or was tt just u pretending to be someone else. sigh, everything hurtss.

so, went to the doctor, no improvement and now, they cover my right eye with this eye patch. i look like a pirate now. sigh

SOMEBODY SAVE MEEEEE</strong><br /><br />i'm addicted. i'm becoming those stupid gambler you see on channel 8 dramas ):<br /><br />online gambling is causing my downfalllllllll. i can lose 1.5k dollars on roulette and baccarat in a few hours then earn it bck to 1.7k again and cycle repeats for the last few days. then i decided to STOP. god, so now i am 260dollars richer. THANK U AC. u helped me so fucking much in winning bck the money though i do hate u a lil for introducing tt to me. hahaha. <br /><br />oh, and not to mention i totally screwed up my smu interview cause there's 6 mass comm people in my group. i barely even spoke. but thank u to poon,alicia,jm,amal, adrian, AC. they call, sms and accompany me to the interview. THANK U THANK U VERY MUCHHH. i feel very much loved. haha<br /><br />okay, back to the online gambling thingy. god, rei and i were so lucky. we had 3 accounts with 500$ in each account. so anything tt goes below 500dollars, we have to pay. so 3 x 500 = 1500$. anything below 1500, ac and i gotta pay.<br /><br />ac and i played and we kept losing, so it was 209 + 370 + 48 = 627$!!! which means we need to pay 873$! then the next day, he was sleeping, i decided to try my luck again, thi time asking reinald to sit beside me. and we kept winning. WE WERE FUCKING PRO. KEPT WINNING AND WINNING i made the 209$ account to 857$ and the 370$ account to 700$. okay, but i made the 48$ account bankrupt. so in total, from 627$, it became 1557$. i swear he was fucking pleasantly surprised when he woke up. <br /><br />then, the itchy hand me decided to act pro and played with the 700$ account and it became 65$. I GOT REALLY SCARED and then i used the 857$ account and tried to make it 1.5k back. then then then blah blah blahhhhh roulette baccarat, finally, it became 1.7k like tt. and adding the 65$ in the other account, i won 1765 -1500 = 260$$. ac decided to let me have the 260$ cause apparently he won alot from soccer. blahhh. <br /><br />so that's my tale on how i became 260$ richer. i m feeling a lil richer that if anyone comes up to me and ask for a treat, NO PROBLEM!<br /><br />on another totally different note,&nbsp; federico macheda quite shuai right. haha, he didnt only did it not once but twiceeeee!!!!!!! <br /><br /><br />"

so, he used someone's hp to call me, i called him back on that number later as he wanted to meet the next day, then the person said he doesnt know jonathon and that he just borrowed his phone. so i waited for his call, no calls. and went to sleep and someone woke me up around like 3am? 4am? 5am? calling from another random number. i answered and i forgotton what i said, then awhile later, got a call from another random number. GOD. this is like the first time i receive calls in a night from like 4 or 5 different random person. anw, he's gone last night. he called me again using that free phone in the airport you know.. so i asked him 'i am like an angel?' then he said sth like 'oh, so this is the number to heaven?' i dont know. i find it so funny. HAHAHAHA. okay nvm

ANDDDDD, I WON 38DOLLARS FROM SOCCER BETTINGGGGGGGG!!!!!! YAYY! it was 8dollars. bt it increased! yayy! cause i bet on some spanish team, I AM PROO. okay, not me. i jus followed his advice. ahahha. anw, i was supposed to be like 68 pls. but SOMEONE REFUSE TO BELIEVE ME AND BET ON ARSENALLL. i told him arsenal will win. he didnt believe it and he said he will just bet with me. i won, but he said change it to a free meal instead.

"event","i did this quiz given by daniel again and i swear it's so true. fuck<br /><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);""><br /></span><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);""><strong>It would appear that at this particular time of your life you are going through a tough time. You are feeling (or have recently felt) miserable and depressed and perhaps you are still feeling that way. </strong>Maybe all the trials and tribulations just aren't worth it. Your present anxieties could have been associated with either your 'private' or 'business' life - whatever ... what you really need at this time is to get away from it all, maybe a vacation - alone, or better still, perhaps with someone that you know really cares for you, someone who appreciates you - not for what you have but for who you are. A short vacation may be all you need to afford you the time to recover and to get back to your normal vital self.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"">Being a likeable person you get on well with neighbours and friends. You don't need anything to 'Rock your boat'. You want to<strong> 'love' and to be loved'. (gosh, i practically told everyone tt)</strong></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);""><strong>Loneliness is soul destroying and at this time you feel lost and lonely,</strong> perhaps it is because you feel so frustrated that you are prepared to go out of your way to become emotionally involved with someone who could accept you for what you are. You are <strong>egocentric, antagonistic and quick to take offence</strong>, although it must be said, <strong>you can control your pent-up up emotion and thus avoid open conflict</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"">From every direction there appear to be unwarranted restrictions on your freedom of action and this is producing considerable stress. You're really looking for independence and freedom from any restriction and therefore avoiding any obligations or anything which might prove hampering. You are being subjected to considerable pressures and you would like nothing better than to escape from them but you tend to lack the necessary strength of purpose to succeed in this. Whichever way you turn you are being frustrated. You need to be free to do your 'thing' in your own way.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"">You are anxious about all the limitations to which you are subjected to at this time. You feel that you are not valued for what or who you are. <strong>You need OUT. So why procrastinate any longer - MOVE!</strong></span></p>fucking, fucking true. it gives me the creeps. <br /><br />"

oh, went vivo with ras,poon,sham and joseph the other day. blooodyyyyyyyy valentine...... gore gore. everyone kept asking me what happened, I CANNOT REMEMBER. i close my eyes during like 3/4 of the movie. all i can remember is whispering 'dont see. dont see. dont see' haha! and i rememered the dead silence movie with chron nick poon and sham some time back. HAHAHA! nick was covering poon eyes. AND CHRON WHO WAS SITTING BESIDE ME, WAS PULLING MY HAND AWAY FROM MY EYES. ASKING ME TO WATCH. cause he claims he need to help me. 

and then, i thought about it. screw those suspicions and doubts, and you not helping to clear those doubts, in turn making me feel more paranoid is not helping anything at all. so, i decide to forgo you as a friend. sorry, bt thinking and getting so paranoid every single fucking day is killing me. and besides, i cannot take it if everything came true. BUT FUCK, i still have to see your face and get stuck with you. not for long i swear. not for long. SIGH.

"event","If God is all I need, then why do I continuely search for other things in empty spaces. It makes no sence. On the surface I don't feel myself, or like the person I really want to be...someone completely devoted to God. Deep down I really want to make the right choices, and give everything to God, but I don't seem capable of geting past some stupid things. Growing up in the church is bitter-sweet. On one hand, I've grown up knowing God, and realizing what life is really about. But on the other hand, now a days, I really dont know why I believe what I do anymore. Beliving in him just because I have all my life isn't good anymore. This probably sounds really weird, but its like theres two of me. The one part is struggling with worldly things,while the other is screamin God is everythin you need, just trust him. I know with out a doubt, 100% there is a God, but what exactly I'm supposed to do with my life . I want to give up and just say screw it all, but some part of me won't let go. About 4 years ago, I felt a call to something. I can't explain it, but I know God wants me to do something big for him. But if I don't get by these struggles, I'll never do it. If I don't throw away all my dreams and self-ambitions I'll never reach it. It's all my fault this stuff is happening too. I never read my Bible, I never pray meaninful prayers or heart-filled ones, I always re-commit my life to God, but it always ends in failure. I seem so determined, but always screw up...and get so ticked off. Everytime I screw up, its like crucifying him all over again...and knowing that makes me feel even worse. But it's because of his amazing grace that I can get back up, and try again. It's because of him I'm here, and it's because of him I'll never give up. Thinking of all my friends or people  who don't believe in God; if I put my self in their shoes, goin through life not knowin why I'm here, and the ultimate happiness and fulfilment, ad a personal realtionship with JC, thats gotta be 100x worse than what I'm goin through. No matter what I go through, he's there. And from now on I'm always gonna seek him first.

Turning endless pages of this tragedy 
Sculpting every move you compose a symphony

Broken stained-glass windows, the fragments ramble on 
Tales of broken souls, an eternity's been won

I look beyond the empty cross
forgetting what my life has cost
and wipe away the crimson stains
and dull the nails that still remains
More and more I need you now,
I owe you more each passing hour
battle between grace and pride
I gave up not so long ago
So steal my heart and take the pain,
wash the feet and cleanse my pride
take the selfish, take the weak,
and all the things I cannot hide
take the beauty, take my tears
this sin-soaked heart and make it yours
take my world apart
take it now, take it now
and serve the ones that I despise
speak the words I can't deny
watch the world I used to love
fall to dust get blown away
I look beyond the empty cross
forgetting what my life has cost

"event","Ha, I just got back from the super bowl party at my church, and I'm glad that Ben and Danny came and got me, so thanks guys! Anyways, I am liking our youth group mo and mo, even though I need to pray for patience *cough ASHLEY cough*.....
I truly believe that we have the potential to change the schools we attend if we just surrender everything and become true followers and lovers of Jesus. Recently I have been on a ""dry spell"" when it comes to everything pretty much, but its all because I stopped reading my bible and praying, and attendoing church. I now know that if I ever want a chance to be fullfilled, truly happy, and in love with life, I need God. I never want to go back to my old way of life, and I truly wanna be used by God. I really have no clue who reads my journal, but if you EVER wanna talk about anything, any struggles, prayer requests, questions, ANYTHING, just comment. I'll be more than happy to listen and help as best as I can. Now I'm off to bed, cause its really late and i still have hw to complete. Adios amigos..."

"event","Today, I went to church for the first time in about 1 month. It felt strange at first, but I realized its where I need to be. This is the longest time i have gone w/o going to chutch and it was weird. Without Jesus,my life is pointless. Nothing seems fulfilling without God, and in reality nothing is worth doing if im not drawing closer to him. I can't wait to go off to college or do w/e it is I am supposed to do, but anything then is better than high school. A christian college is probably where I'll end up, but theres really no telling. im tired now so adios. 

oh yeah, keep my family in ur prayers, they really need it."

"event","Wow..alot of things are going horribly wrong right now, and I doubt many people know what........just keep thinking postively...happy thoughts

Friday I think I'm gonna practice with Dan, Brandon, and Andy, which should be fun. I'll do anything to get better at my guitar, ha. 

I wish I could go back to when I was younger...the good ol days..................................................or go forward til Senior year of highschool........if anyone reads this then sorry for rambling on, but its my journal so poo in ur face.



Ohhhh...also, in school, I have recently noticed alot of A-HOLES! Some moron was kicking this kid's lunchbox around, and then taking his stuff and throwing it, so I told the kid to stop acting like a jerk, and so since this kid was bigger, he slammed my head into a locker, and started insulting me and my religion (he knows im a christian). Now, if this dude would have been smaller, I would have charged him and beat the living sh*t out of him. But that wouldn't have taugh him much, I need to be more christ-like...Not only after that, but at lunch, the same kid walked by with his moron friends and started stealing my food....wow..they are cool kids aren't they?"

"event","I heard a voice through the discord
A deluge of passersby
I saw one gaze frozen in time
Watching me passing by

I swear I'll know your face in the crowd
And I'll hear your voice so loud
When you're whispering

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another

Here's my kiss to betray
Desperate to brush the lips of grace
Do you feel hollow when you think of how I lied?

Oh sweet angel of mercy
With your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me
Oh sweet angel of mercy
With your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger
Hey unloving
I will love you
And will love you

Jesus I'm ready to come home
I'm ready to come
Jesus I'm ready to come home
Unfaithful
Ungraceful
And unloving
I will love you"

They are seriously like the best friends in the world.  Amber asked me to go to Panera Bread with her so I went and then she wanted to go back to her house and watch the Shawshank Redemption.  So we open the door to her house and SURPRISE!  made me extremely happy.  It was really nice.  After everyone left Liz, Christina, and I spent the night at Amber's house.  Had a few drinks nothing enough to get buzzed or anything just relaxing.  I am going to miss everyone so much."

"event","Have you ever just fell in love with a song?  Even after you have heard it a million times just one second, one second you are listening to the song and it just seems so perfect to you in every way?  Well the song I have fallen for recently is this one...

Bat your eyes girl
Be otherworldly
Count your blessings
Seduce a stranger
What's so wrong with
Being happy
Kudos to those who
See through sickness
When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
I suggest we
Learn to love ourselves before it's
Made illegal
When will we learn?
When will we change?
Just in time to
See it all fall down
Those left standing...will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been
When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
Floating in this
Cosmic jacuzzi
We are like frogs oblivious
To the water
Starting to boil
No one flinches
We all float face down
When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by

Anyways.  Saturday Lauren's birthday party should be much fun.  Then Sunday I am going up to Maine with my Mom to visit my sister fro her 18th birthday.  (Amber if you want to come you can).  

I am feeling odd.  Things are strange and so are people.  I miss some people.  I haven't talked to Amber in like two days maybe not even that and I feel like I miss her.

She wanted to get hair dye.  Went back to Stop N Shop to pick up the film then went to good old Elm St. for a moment then back to her house so I could dye her hair.  I dyed her hair, we ate macaroni n cheese, played phase 10, and chatted a bit.  Then I helped her on her homework which consisted of me playing with the  magnet board and we talked some more.  Came home about 10:45 got online for a few minutes talked to Mike a bit about his female problems and tried to go to bed listening to a ""string quartet tribute to tool"" didn't work although I really liked the music I couldn't fall asleep.  Eventually though I managed to fall asleep and I woke up with the HUGEST (ok not the hugest but kinda bad) headache I have had in a while.  Took some advil and went back to bed.  Woke up to the phone and talked to Shauna for a bit.  She might be coming over at or around 2pm or something like that.  We will see she has a habit of being late.  I am kinda bored so I am going to listen to some music.  Maybe I will update later."

"event","Yesterday was Amber's party.  I got to see all these people that I love and it made me really happy.  Steph, Lauren, and I spent the night at Amber's house and drank.  There was so much talking.  Steph gets more talkative when she is drunk and so do I.  

I was just thinking how can a word express a feeling.  Obviously it is so general because everyone is different.  

There is a can of Mountain Dew sitting on my desk.  I don't know how it got there.  I don't really care much for soda and I never drink it at home and if I do its Diet Coke and it isn't in a can.  I don't like soda in a can or bottle.  I like it in a cup with ice.  I should probably stop talking about soda because it is extremely pointless.  

My mom is confusing me something about forgetting she left a knife in the freezer.  Why it would be in the freezer at all I have no clue but hey whatever.

I hate the word fine.  If you say what you mean do you mean what you say.  Why say something if you don't mean it?  It devalues everything else you say if you do that.  What is the point of talking if what you say has no value?  

Amber had cheese at her party.

Who wrote the dictionary and why do they get to decide what words mean?  That is not fair.  :-(

Afterwards they wanted us to go to Boston with them and hang out at their house.  We were bored so we decided we would go.  We made sure Theo got the license plate number though just in case we ended up missing or dead lol or something.  It was alright there.  We kinda hung out all night talking and listening to music pretty much.  I have never had two guys argue over me (or one) it was rather funny.  Besides a few key events it was alright.  We'll see.

"event","Wow.  Last night was probably one of the weirdest nights this summer.  Girl's night out lol.  First we go to the park and start drinking.  Feel pretty buzzed now.  We here some weird guy screaming in Rock Rimmon so we decide to go because he is being creepy.  From there we come back to my house around 1:30.  My mom was all like I am so glad you came home when you did the neighbors called the cop at this guy screaming at rock rimmon blah blah blah so we stay at my house for a few minutes and get dresed warmly, grab some eggs and head over to Shauna's boyfriends, David's house.  Well David lives near South Willow street kind of so it is a rather long walk.  Along the way we encounter several creepy guys.  One guy was in a station wagon and would go about 2 miles an hour and kept comming around the block trying to talk to us.  It was kind of funny.  Then we head over to Cumberland Farms on Union St to get a drink.  Well there we meet these two weird guys.  We tell them we are going to egg this guys car and they want to come.  So use being still buzzed we get in the car with them and show them where to go.  They egg his car for us and the drive away.  They ask us to come over their house for a few beers so we end up going after some debate.  We get there and sit in their living room and continue drinking our vodka.  A little bit of time pasts and they are doing someithing with the computer and they step aside and up comes a porno.  It is actually funny when I look back on it.  Well after about 5-10 minutes of us asking them to turn it off they finally do.  So we continue dirnking and they get all touchy feely so girls of course resort to the we're lesbians.  Anywho we start asking for him to bring us home.  He says after he finishes his drink.  Well about an hour later he hasn't finish is drink which was half full to begin with.  So I am getting agitated with him.  I start bitching at him and he retailates and finally we decide to fuck them and walk home even though we have no idea where the hell we are so we leave and I pour my orange juice on his car in anger lol.  We start walking and about two minutes later they drive up beside us and say they will give us a ride home.  Well on Elm St some car is honking at him and he says something about his gun and starts reaching for the dashboard and the other guy is like no no no and so we are kind of freaked out because I guess most people would if they were around them because they were really weird and like child molestors.  Anywho we are stopped at a red light about to turn on to bridge street when the car next to us gets out of her car and walks over to the passenger side window and starts screaming at him and hitting him and grabbing his money.  And they try to drive off but she has ahold of something and she is looking at us and she is like ""you guys need to GET OUT of the car these guys are asshole I will drive you girls home"" so looks totally serious and opens my door and I go to get out and the guy in the front seat shuts my door and they lock them so we can't get out so we are wicked freaked out.  We are driving across the bridge and we were like who was that and they try to play it off like they never met ehr before in their lives haha yeah right so everyone starts yelling and its crazy and we are screaming for them to stop and let us get out and finally he stops and we get out and go home.  There is kinda more to the story but I don't feel like sharing so lol that was my strange evening."

Fuck that yes I can!  God what the fuck am I talking about.  I look back and reread me entries and they are shit.  Complete shit.  I am not some weak little bitch that gets walked all over.  I stand up for myself and don't sit there and do nothing.  So fuck those entries.  I am going to New York City tomorrow and I am going to have an awesome time with my best friend ever Amber.  I am not going to let anything bring me down.  I am still kind of depressed but you know what I don't care because I will live."

Brad stayed till today.  I won't go into details because I don't feel the need to.  Everything should be great.  It is.  On the outside.  On the inside it isn't so great.  Just.  I don't know.  I don't think I should get in to it in here because people actually read it.  I want to because it would be nice to get things out.  I have no one at all to talk to.  I mean... I do but I don't.  When I need to talk to someone I don't just come out and say hey I need to talk.  I am just not like that.  I kind of beat around the bush.  Obviously not well.  Sometimes I amaze myself by how low I can manage to get myself.  I want to cry so bad but I have been holding it in for so long I am not sure I can let it out.

"event","Damn.  I have been partying non stop.  Lets recap.  Saturday we went driving around with Roden and Sammi and Jen and Shauna.  Well we smoked a lot.  Lol we ran out of gas and it was so funny.  Sammi was jumping on the car while Roden tried to get the car going on fumes.  It was wicked funny because we were out in the middle of no where on hooksett back roads.  We end up getting the car to go up a hill and then it ran out completely so we just rolled down sitting in the car lol.  We pulled in to someones drive way and they were home but a car was there so Roden and Sammi borrowed some gas and left a note and money lmao.  Anywho yeah so much more went on that night but last night damn.  We went to the beach and smoked so much then went back to Sammi's house and his grandfather was wicked messed up it was so funny.  Then we went to Brian's house and he lives in a condo so we stuck into the pool and sauna area and me and Shauna got sooooo trashed.  Everyone else was kinda drunk but me and Shauna were wicked messed up it was so funny we had two bottles of captin morgans and we were so drunk.  I ended up puking a lot for a feww minutes lol.  Well then after a while we were driving home again on the hookset back roads and we were in two cars.  Shauna and Roden in one and me, Jen, and Sammi.  Well Roden and Sammi were the drivers because they both swore they were sober enough.  Well you know boys they we racing like crazy and well yeah we crashed in to Roden's car.  It was pretty bad.  I smashed my head against the window and got a bloody nose it was awful.  So yeah we looked at the cars and it didn't seem to bad so we decided that it was a deer and we swerved to miss it.  Well yeah me and Shauna ended up crashing at Sammi's house and yeah in the morning there was hell.  Me and Shauna went out side to look at the car and it was completely smashed up.  And Sammi was getting hell from his sister because it was her car and she doesn't have insurance.  So yeah right now I am just hanging out with Shauna and Jen before we go back out and cause some more trouble lol."

I slap my fingers against the key bored and my thoughts pour out.  I discuss my very being with this white palette of freedom.  I watch little black letters fill up the box and realize that is what I am.  My thoughts.  I continue typing till I feel ready to stop.  I reread what I have written and wonder why I wrote it.  I highlight the text and press delete.  I clear my mind for the day.  I begin to write my actual entry.  I pause and thing that this means nothing to me.  I explain my day.

  Went to the park by Central High School with Steph to meet up with Zack, Tom, Neils, and Jon (I think thats his name).  Played foot ball or tried to lol then it started raining so we all piled into Toms 4 seater convertible and went to Zack's house.  We stayed there for a little while listening to music and playing fooseball(sp?).  Then Jon called Nick and Nick came to Zack's house and Neils and Jon went in Nick's car and the rest of us went in Tom's and we headed to Tom's house.  Hehe we beat Nick there.  We played pool and fooseball(sp?) and listen to music and stuff at Tom's.  It was actually really fun especially for being 100% sober.  Well I am going to go to bed because I only got 4 hours of sleep after last night's craziness.  Night night."

So I stopped at my house to pick up some alc and we went to Amber's.  We started drinking a little.  I stopped though after like 2 shots.  I don't know why.  I have been feeling really strange lately.  Right now I am not talking about like emotional strange but actually physically strange.  I don't know if it is the new meds I don't think it is because I have been feeling this way since before I started them.  I don't know if it is from hitting my head so hard at the bottom of the Liz's pool.  That why would be weird.  I am trying to remember exactly when it started because it started a while ago me getting really dizzy then it stopped and we chalked it up to withdrawal from the Zoloft.  I have been getting dizzy I guess you could call it that.  Like I will turn my head and it will take a few seconds for everything to catch up.  Also I have been feeling really tingly.  Kind of like when you foot falls asleep but not exactly.  I don't know."

I fell asleep fairly quickly last night because I started a new medication Mirtazapine.  It is a sedative and an antidepressant so I have to take it at night because it will help me sleep.  I am wondering if that is why I slept so much or if maybe I just slept so much because I was able to.  Usually I can never sleep so maybe I was just catching up on it.  I don't know.  It isn't really important.  I am really in the mood for Oreos.  Strange.  I feel very tired.  I really like renting some movies though.  I don't know I am in a weird mood.  I guess I am going to go.

Then bright and early (9:30am) we went to target cute cute and then to the mall.  I was going to buy some cute stuff at Spencer's but when I got there the stuff was'nt cute anymore.  Weird.  We went to hot topic and I bough some henna paste and a cd.  Then we went home.  Then to my aunts and went swimming and stuff.  We ended up raiding my aunts liquor cabinet.  First we took a bottle of peppermint schnapps then we went swimming then when we went back inside my kelptoness got to me so we ended up pouring half of her vodka into a bottle and then some random bottle that I have no idea what it was.  Anywho after that we went to Applebee's because we haven't been there in forever then we rented some movies, The Guru, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, and Just Married.  We only ended up watching the guru and how to lose tonight but thats ok because I have already seen just married.  Right now I think I am going to go and hang up a light because Amber lent me her drill.  Night night."

You do not want to be able to<br>take things back and this is the perfect thing<br>for you. You don't change your mind very often.<br>When you become fixed on something you achieve<br>it, better or worse. Instant death will prevent<br>anyone from helping you back into the world you<br>loathe so much.

Really young.  I'd say anywhere from 15-35.<br>But you'll go out with a bang.  You'll get in a<br>car accident or be shot.  You'll never have to<br>see yourself get old.  Sad though.  Really sad.<br>By the way, its common knowledge that more<br>people with great goals and aspirations die<br>young.  And if you want to die old, you'll die<br>young and vice versa.

You sure are motivated.  You have a definite knack<br>for getting what you want.  You always put your<br>own interests before those of others, and you<br>almost always find youself being satisfied.<br>Though you have determination, try some<br>compassion.  Putting others first occassionally<br>can get you even more satisfying relationships.

"event","Yeah so last night I was super depressed but this morning I am a bit better.  I am not depressed, not really happy either but just numb kind of.  So yeah last night I was online while I was in my depressed state of mind and Brad IMs me.  So we talk for a few minutes and I actually ended up feeling a lot better.  One of the things I like about him is he actually talks to me like if I were talk tell someone else I was feeling down they would be like ""oh I'm sorry"" and I understand that they probably don't know what else to say but like if I am telling them I am feeling down at the moment I am not telling them so I can complain I am most likely looking for advice or guidance of some sort of at least the reassurance that I am not alone.  I dunno I guess I am going to go.  Just thumbs up to Brad.  Bye"

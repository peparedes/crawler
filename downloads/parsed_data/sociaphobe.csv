"event","I work for Time Warner Cable now.  A pretty cool job, actually.  I install and repair people's cable, cable internet, digital phone, or surround sound devices.  It's really easy, but sometimes uncomfortable.  

I'm actually in training right now.  I rode around in one of the trucks with a coworker who's been there a while and got to help/learn how they do things.  I knew most of it already, which is probably why I think it's going to be an easy job, and also half the time you spend driving around in the truck.  

My training, however, is a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.  Yesterday we spent the day training at the Pole Farm.  The Pole Farm is a section behind the main training building where they have installed about 15 utility poles that each go up 35 feet.  They also have some fake houses, and taps, and other cable installation stuff.  It's where we'll train how to climb the poles, as well as install cable and troubleshoot problems.  Right now we're concentrating on pole climbing. 

It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.  It's a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but it's really scarry--largely because it's a lot less safe than I thought it would be.  You don't even get to wear a strap or harness or anything when climbing.  Basically, you wear gaffs, which are metal brackets that attach to your legs and feet that have a single 1"" spike sticking out of the bottom side of your foot.  You then grab the pole on its sides, and you stab your foot into the pole, and just walk up the pole.  It sounds easy, and the guys doing it make it look easy, but it's really not easy.  Uses a completely different set of muscles than you normally use.  and you ahve to keep your feet at a 35 degree angle away from the pole, or the spike slips out and you come falling down on to the rocks below--all of us slipped and fell at least once--just thank god we were only at 3 feet and not 20 feet.  By the time we finish the pole climbing, we will have to go all the way to the 20 foot marker, belt off, lean far to the right, far to the left, then walk around the pole laterally, then come back down.  It's tough, but I'm confident I can do it.  I did it at three feet, which won't be any different than 20--except I'll be scared out of my mind that I'll slip and fall.  

But hey, it's been interesting.  From what they say, every single class at least one person either falls off the pole at 20 feet, or they just quit and say they can't do it.  If you fall off the pole, you get terminated--because you'll probably break a bone, and then not be able to complete the assignment.  And if you quit, obviously you don't get to keep your job then either.  So I know I'm not going to quit--I just hope I'm not the one person that falls.  That would suck ass.

Well, that's all for now.  Hope everyone is doing well.  Things are going good down here in Houston.  It's been really hot lately--and I know it's going to get even hotter come August."

"event","Just so all you people realize--most 'stalkers' aren't really that creepy.  And if they are, it's not by choice, and it's not dangerous.  The thing is, if you KNOW someone is 'stalking' you, by your standards, they probably aren't really stalking you.  A REAL stalker would never fully let you know when and where and how you're being watched.  It's THOSE kinds you need to watch out for.  And chances are you'll never find out who they are until they do whatever it is they wanted to do with you to you.  And those types of stalkers are very rare.  Today's common 'stalker' are usually just people who are too shy to approach you, but still appreciate you--beit for your external beauty, or something they see on your inside.  

I just wanted all you to know that you should be nice to your local stalker, because in reality, they're just someone who adores you so much they're too afraid to approach you.  So stop worrying, the REAL stalkers you'll never even know existed until you're bound and gagged in a damp, musky-smelling basement somewhere in soho.

So do a good deed today: go up to your stalker and tell him (or her) they're cute, and introduce yourself.

BTW: this type of 'good stalker' that I'm refering to does not include anyone that is already comfortable around you--meaning ex's, or people you think are just 'friends', etc.  Anyone that is already able to--and frequently does--talk to you non-chalantly, they might potentially be the 'bad stalker' type if they're following you around everywhere, taking pictures, etc..

This has been a public service announcement."

"event","Interesting thing happened the other day.<BR><BR>After renting a movie at the local Blockbuster Video, my companion and I walked around the corner to the Albertsons to purchase some late-night candy for our late-night video.  I looked in astonishment as my favorite candy brand (Nestle) was on sale!  Three for a dollar - mix and match!  I was so excited!  After about an hour of debating, my companion and I settled on six different candy bars as follows: Two Rootsie Rolls, a Bit O' Honey, a SweetTarts Shockers, a Butterfinger, and some other peanut-type candy bar.  We rush to the counter, present our Albertsons membership card, along with our handful of candy bars, and the cashier gladly rings them up.  <BR><BR>Can you guess what the total was?<BR><BR>If you guessed $2.00 <B>YOU ARE WRONG!</B>  That's right, the total came out to be $2.01.  Hmmm...perplexing, isn't it?  I certainly thought so.  I asked the cashier how if the candy bars were three for a dollar, how it would end up as $2.01 for six?  The cashier simply shrugged it off and said something resembling ""I dunno, I guess it's just how the computer calculates the discount.""  <BR><BR>Being as it's almost 1:00am at this point, I decided not to press the issue, and paid the $2.01.  But I'll have you know, I was determined to call their customer service line and complain.<BR><BR>And I did just that.  As soon as I got home, I called the number on the bottom of the receipt.  1-877-932-7948.  I immediately got through to a 'customer care representative'.  I told them that I had an issue--that I was overcharged by a penny for an item.  The 'customer care representative' (from now on to be refered to as the CCR) informed me that any overcharges must be taken care of at the store itself.  He was going to transfer me, when I told him that I mentioned it to the people at the store, and they didn't do anything about it.  He then asked me if I'd prefer to have him take the information and electronically transfer a case to the store for the manager to look over.  I said yes.  So first he asked if I'd like them to contact me when the problem was taken care of.  I said ""of course"", and gave him my name, phone number, and address.  He then asked me to tell him the details of what happened.  So I explained to him how I bought six candy bars that were supposed to be three for a dollar, and instead they ended up costing me $2.01.  After a slight pause (and whilst my companion is getting increasingly embarassed at knowing me at all for going through so much trouble about a penny from purchasing a hoarde of candy bars), he told me he successfully submitted the case, and my case number was 55726.  I said thank you, and hung up.  My companion then complained about how big of an idiot I was, then we proceeded to watch the video we rented, and gorge ourselves on the candy we just purchased.  <BR><BR>The next morning is when the fun happened.  I got this call that woke me up sometime around 11:00am, and since I didn't get to the phone in time, the answering machine recorded almost our entire conversation.  I'm going to try and write the transcript of that conversation below:<BR><BR>Austin: Hi, [insert my name here], my name is Austin, I'm the store director down here at the Albertsons in[inster city here].<BR>Me: mmm-hmm.<BR>Austin: I'm calling you in reguards tothe uh...the candy bars.<BR>Me: Okay.<BR>Austin: Ummm...I guess, well, they didn't give me a whole lot of information here...ummm...and I was hoping to uhh...hear it from you.<BR>Me: Okay, well, quite simple, you advertised three candy bars for one dollar...<BR>Austin: uh-huh...<BR>Me: And I bought six candy bars and it cost $2.01<BR>Austin: Okay...<BR>Me: and I noticed that as a mathamatical error--I assume it'd difficult for a cash register to compute one third of a cent--uhh..but this is a concern to me not necessarily because I buy a lot of candy bars or anything, but because country wide, potentially that could be a lot of money that consumers are losing.<BR>Austin: Correct.  And I agree with you completely--and before I called you, I actually went through and took every single candy bar that was on three for a buck and test scanned everything, and I found that a couple of the candy bars messed up.  You hit it right on the head, because you have to set the computer up--because it has to ring up 33.33 in a row and--did you buy all three of the same candy bar?<BR>Me: No<BR><BR>Anyway, I just realized how long it would take for me to transpose this whole damn thing, because it goes on for some length at how you have to set up the computer to recognize each of the candy bars that are in the deal to work with eachother--and some of them weren't set up properly, that's why I got charged the extra cent.  He then went on to say he was most concerned about how I said when I mentioned it to the teller, the teller didn't do anything about it.  So he told me how he was going to repremand her--which I felt bad for--but really, she shoudl've taken off the cent when I mentioned it to her.  I then went on to ask him if he was going to pass the problem on to corporate or something so other stores wouldn't run into the same problem, and he said he would, but he was pretty sure it was just in their store, because you have to set up the scanners individually, and it would've been a store problem.  He also told me that he couldn't figure out how to set up the scanners properly, so he instead changed all the candy bars to be 33 cents each--that way they're 3 for 99 cents now--until his scan expert shows up on monday.<BR><BR>All in all, it was quite amusing for me.  I guess it just goes to show how I have no life and need to get a hobby or something...  <BR><BR>Too bad, though, I never got my penny back.  I should have asked him to mail me a check for the penny....hmmm...I have his name, maybe I could call and ask...<BR><BR>Anyway, speaking of candy--I took the candy test.  <BR><BR><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/P/PartyDownUnder/1093738019_resbrownie.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""HASH(0x8c0ba08)""><br>Brownie- Your like a brownie you melt on people and<br>people stick to you your kind and affectionate.<br>Your a good listener whether you know it or not<br>and people look up to you no matter how they<br>act everybody has a place for you in their<br>heart.

"event","Why do revelations always come at 3am when you're contently tucked away in bed?

I had way too much Dr Pepper before I went to bed, and the caffiene and sugar has kept me up.  I've been bouncing back and forth on my bed, tossing and turning, etc..  And whenever I'm lying there trying to fall asleep and can't, since my body can't be that active, my mind is.  Thinking a zillion things a minute.  Until I just can't keep it all inside anymore.

So here's what I came up with.  Not really a huge revelation--more just an expansion of things I've mentioned previously.

I realize now it's not about being busy.  Well, it is but it isn't.  I've mentioned before that I'm not happy unless I'm busy.  That's why I've jam-packed my schedule with things to do.  It's only when I have downtime that I get depressed with my life.

Well, that's true to an extent, but it goes a little deeper, I've found.  It's not JUST the being busy that has to happen.  I have to keep advancing.  It's not a matter of filling the day up with things to do, it's a matter of filling the day up with things that allow me to advance something or someone (myself included) in someway, somehow.  I just have to be proactive.  I have to be constructive.  Even destructive would work, if it's in a constructive manor.  Just doing something.  It can be simple--just doing a small thing I haven't done before.  Or it can be huge--like getting a college degree.  Whatever it is, I just have to continue advancing someway, somehow.  I realize now that I will never be content with my life in a pattern.  I will never be able to be one of those people that:

Get out of bed.<BR>In shower at 6:22am.<BR>Breakfast of cornflakes at 6:48am.<BR>Ready for work by 7:20am.<BR>In car by 7:23am.<BR>Start car 7:24am.<BR>At work 8:15am.<BR>Lunch at 12:15pm.<BR>End lunch at 1:15pm.<BR>Off work at 5:30pm.<BR>Stay until 6:10pm.<BR>In car by 6:14pm.<BR>Start car 6:16pm.<BR>Home 7:07pm.<BR>Dinner 7:30pm.<BR>TV 8:30pm.<BR>Fall asleep on couch 10:30pm.<BR>Move to bed 1:00am.<BR>Repeat.

I will never be able to do that.  If I ever get stuck in a pattern like that, I will be the most depressed individual you've ever met.  I have to do something.  Always.  I will never be content with a 9-5 job.  I see that now.  I mean, I'll be content, for a while--assuming I feel that I'm accomplishing something with the job.  Or I'd have to be accomplishing something in life outside the job.  Building a business.  Building a car.  Building a house.  Fixing a car.  Fixing a house.  Looking for a new job.  Finding a new job.  Coming up with something to do with my time.  Something, ANYTHING.  Volunteering at a hospital.  Going to school.  I have to keep moving.  I'm like a shark.  If I stop, stay stagnant in the water too long, I'll die.  

Okay, so like I said, it's not that much of a revelation.  But it makes sense to me.  This is why I should own and operate a business.  Manotany kills me.  If I own and operate a business, I'll have something new to do every day.  It'll be a constant accomplishment.  

Well, those are my 3am ramblings.  I hope you enjoyed."

"event","I am updating this journal again.  I don't really know why, because I have yet to figure it out.  This is so sad.  I want to understand how to set this up so I like it, and add pictures and all that fun stuff--since I know the potential for this live journal is 100 million times better than what I'm using on freeopendiary, but at the same time I have forty billion things going on all at once that are taking all my time (and then some).

<HR>

So here is all that is going on in my life right now:
1) I have a career!  Well, sorta.  I have a job that right now I'm loving.  I'm a Network Administrator for a mortgage company.  It doesn't pay a ton right now, but when I hit four months, I get to re-negotiate my salary.  I will hit four months in another month and a half, I think.  At that point, I'm going to have at least one college degree that I didn't have before (I just got the certificate for my AA two days ago), and I'm going to hopefully get some computer certs like my CCNA, MCP, MCSE, MCAD, A+ and Network+ within the next couple of months.  So I'll become very valuable very quickly.  Another good point, is that if I leave, they might be fucked.  I've gotten very involved into this system, and they rely quite strongly upon me.  If I leave, then they'll have a heck of a time getting someone else caught up to date.  So what I figure I can do, is as soon as I get VPN working, get a new firewall, get the BSD or SBS server working, then I can run a Remote Desktop through the VPN and manage the entire network from home.  Then I can talk to my boss, tell her that I've become so much more valuable, tell her all the great stuff I've done, tell her about all my new certs, tell her that I can probably get a job elsewhere making tons of money, and tell her how I've saved her money, then tell her that I want to renegotiate my pay for 52k a year salary, and I can remotely run the majority of the network from home.  And I think if I succeed at doing everything I need to do, then she'll go for it.  Or I can quit and get a job at Intel or something like that where they pay me a ton more.
2) I got my AA finally!  YAY!  I breifly mentioned that in #1, but I'm definately happy about that.  I know it's probably not really going to do much for me, but it's a step toward where I want to go with my schooling.
3) I'm going to the UW in the winter!  Well, I haven't technically gotten my acceptance letter yet, but because of the wonderful direct transfer agreement, I don't think they can say no to me  :)
4) I'm still 'working' at the airport.  Not really, though.  Technically I'm on a leave of absence for the whole summer.  But I still get my flight benefits.  So I don't know what I'm going to do as far as going back when the summer ends.  I guess I'll just go back--maybe I can take another LOA, though.
5) I'm in a band.  Two of them, in fact.  One of them is the Rainbow City Band, which is basically a gay community band.  We just finished up marching season, and I had a blast.  I'm really looking forward to concert season too.  The people in the band are just awesome!  The other band I'm in, don't laugh, is called Zen.  I think.  We never really officially came up with a name for it--because really, it's a horribly dorky band.  We have six members of the band.  My mom, who plays the drums, my dad, who plays the bass, my brother who plays the guitar, Misto, who plays the drums, piano, or keyboard (maybe trumpet later on too, depending on how things go), Khymmy who plays the flute (and maybe some keyboard too), and myself, who plays the Alto Sax, Bari Sax, and sometimes the piano/keyboard.  Yeah, that's a really crazy band.  We have no singers, but we really have no songs either.  We've been working on getting some songs together.  We played a crazy rendition of That's The Way I Like It, and that's it.  It's been great fun, though.
6) I've started yet another business.  And this is just the beginning.  I have plans to own and run one corporation, and four sole-proprietorships.  That is my plan as of now.
7) I've been planning a major heist of some 150 million dollars.  It should go down sometime within the next three years.
8) I have a spectacular girlfriend.  I'm honestly, truely, happy.  I don't know if I've ever been this happy with my life.  Even despite some bad things that have been happening lately, I am honestly the happiest I've ever been.
9) ohhh!  Now it's time for the bad things!  First off, MY CAR!  It got broken into.  The assholes boared into the door to break the lock, they ripped apart my dash trying to get my tapedeck out, they ripped up my carpeting pulling off my 1000watt amp, and they stole my two 500watt 12"" subs out of my trunk--after breaking the entire lock off the trunk altogether.  10) Then, a week or so later, some guy ran into my car while it was parked, on the left hand side.  Put a dent in it.  
11) Then a week or so after that, somebody ran into my car on the OTHER side, and put a HUGE dent in the right fender!  So now I've got a broken-into car, a stolen stereo, stolen subs, stolen amp, broken trunk, smashed in right side, dented in left side.
12) Then I got a speeding ticket--91 in a 60--that I contested in court.
13) I slept through my court date--now I owek 52$ more on top of the 250$
14) Then I got a ticket for having expired tabs.
15) I went in to get new tabs, found out I need to get emissions done first.
16) My car failed emissions. 
17) Tried to find out why my car failed emissions--it needs a new solinoid that will cost me 600+ dollars to replace.

That's about it.  It's been busy lately.  But despite the fact that I'm running around like a chicken with my head cut off, I'm really enjoying my life right now.

I went to Disneyland just the other day--and I went to Pheonix a couple of days after that.  Still traveling, still loving to travel.

And that's my life in a nutshell."

"event","I still haven't figured out the format of LiveJournal yet.  But then again, I haven't bothered spending any time studying it at all.  I should really just sit down, figure out how to make it like I want, and then all will be copesetic in the world.

So what's new in my life?  I turn 21 in a few short weeks.  And for my 21st birthday, I am going to see a taping of The Price Is Right.  I'm bringing my entire immediate family, as well as my grandparents (are they normally considered immediate, or extended family???  I would figure extended, hence why I said ""as well as""), and also about a dozen or so friends.  I requested (and received) twenty tickets to the show.  And I've invited a bunch of people.  Several of them have responded saying they'll attend, a few said they most likely will (just have to check with work and school and whatnot), and a several have said they're unable (or unwilling) to.  Either way, it proves to be one hell of an enjoyable time.  

I love the price is right.

I'm a big dork."

"event","Hello LiveJournal world!  For quite some time I have had a diary at FreeOpenDiary.com.  I must say that LiveJournal is much better.  If you are interested in seeing my FreeOpenDiary, my username there is Neutrality Embodied.

I haven't yet decided wether I'm going to use this Journal as just what it is: a journal, or if I'm more likely to use it to stimulate discussion among people.  For now I'll just use it as a journal...but you never know, that might change.

Today was rather uneventful.  I went to sleep early last night because I had stayed up really late the night before.  I woke up at 6:00am like normal in order to get to my work (I work at FedEx Express in the mornings for two to four hours a day, monday through friday--I also have a second job, but I'll get to that later) by 6:30am.  I worked for two hours exactly, came home, took a nap for about two hours, got up took a shower, got ready for my OTHER work (Horizon Air), and left for work by 1:45pm to be able to be there by 2:45pm.  It was pretty boring there, nothing exciting happened at all.  I then left and made it home by around 11:25pm or so.  That was the extent of my day.  Exciting, eh?

In other news, during my two hour nap between works I had a REALLY FREAKY dream.  I had a baby.  The weird, yet not-so-weird thing is that I actually gave birth to the child (I'm a guy, by the way).  That wasn't the most vivid part of the dream, though, it just happened to be something that upon retrospect of my dream I thought was odd.  I don't know who the mother was, but I remember that the doctor handed me my baby girl wrapped in a blanket, and it was the most odd feeling in the world.  For those of you that know me, I have never had any desire to EVER have a family, I NEVER want kids, I NEVER want a wife, I want pretty much nothing to do with that.  There are several reasons for that which I may go into detail about at a later date, but for now just know that I don't particularly like people in general, and have no desire to have people of my own.  At any rate, this dream was so weird, I remember just randomly wondering around as if meaningless meandering all the while cradeling this baby girl in my arms with the most amazing care I could muster, staring straight at it in--some sort of awe, I suppose, the whole time.  It was the most...odd feeling I've ever felt.  I felt some sort of emotion in my dream that I've never even felt in real life.  I remember thinking that nothing in my life would be the same again.  It was weird as hell.  I woke up this morning thinking I was a father.  It was just the most fucked up thing in the world.  I almost NEVER dream, and when I do, I almost NEVER remember my dreams.  I think in my entire life I've remembered less dreams than I have fingers.  But this one was so incredibly insane--such strong emotions, I don't think I'll ever forget it.  It will haunt me for the rest of my days.  Ech.  I've never even been within a four foot radius of a baby--I have no desire to ever see, touch, hold, or have one.  And yet here I am, in my dream, HAVING a baby.  Odd.

Anyway, I think that's the extent of what I'm going to write today.  It's good to be part of the LiveJournal world.  I'm a huge fan of computers, programming, web-programming, etc.  Everything I know about computers I've taught myself, so I'm not all THAT great at it, but it's fun to learn, and fun to do, so chances are soon I'll be reading the code of LiveJournal trying to figure it all out.  It'll be a blast.  Maybe I'll even submit some code or something.

Well, good night everyone!"

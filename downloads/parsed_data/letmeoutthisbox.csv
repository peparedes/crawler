Hey you, living for tomorrow
You sell your dreams for a pocket of change
Hey you, smokin' up your sorrow,
Just pointing fingers at someone to blame
Hey you, you turn your back on your children
It's left you in that big burning bed
This life's like livin in the gutter
All this pain just makes you feel dead

You're just givin it all, givin it all away
You're just givin it all, giving it all away, hey, hey yayayay

Slow down
Just look a little closer
You might find thats its not the end
You wonder how, your life can get better
When you're alone you just tear yourself down

You're just givin it all, giving it all away,
You're just givin it all, givin it all away
You're just givin it all, giving it all away,
You're just givin it all, giving it all away, hey, hey yayayay

Try and find your better half now
Open your eyes, and find yourself

Hey girl, screamin for attention
Once you get it, you throw it away
And broken, I'm pickin up the pieces
I won't live in all your mistakes

I'm just givin it all, givin it all away
I'm just givin it all, giving it all away,
I'm just givin it all, giving it all away,
I'm just givin it all, giving it all away, hey, hey yayayay"

last night i had a friend almost die from personal injury and had to stay up for that and help her out. then i learn that my other friend totaled her car and ended up going to the hospital. my front headlight is out... so another 100 out the door.. woohoo! and i cant move anymore or just hang out with people or even talk to a guy im interested in without getting asked if i fucking them. or get bothered every day if im going out with someone. or random bullshit from that end.im just really tired of living. i feel like no matter how i move or who i choose i will always have this major burden and im just really tired. all i really want is to be left alone. no botherings from work no bothering from others... just a freaking break from life in general. i cant wait to go to new york this weekend.. but all in the same... i just want to be alone. all i need is to talk to rachel anymore but its so hard to talk over the phone. so thats really the only reason i want to go. Yes i still like abe and all but i dont think i want to get into a relationship for a long time. im talking to a guy from way back and hes cool too. but i dont think i could ever date him. its just really weird right now. i just want everyone to stop fucking lying and then stop bugging me in general about everything. i want to be able to live my life without having someone calling me asking me where i am or who im with and then giving a weird tone about it or something. im just tired of it. i want people more to understand i know what i want in life and not to fucking give me a hard time. if i say no or yes thats what i mean. its FINAL. this goes for everyone. dont fuck with me when ive made my fucking mind up. That being said.. maybe people will finally leave me alone.. or just listen.. or stop lying to people to cause me more fucking problems than i need. i dont play games. im honest and like shit to be straight. as in truthful, not orientation O_o.. but god damnnit everyone needs to stop playing games with ME."

"event","havnet updated in awhile. might be moving out soonish depending on the situation. trying to figure out how to tell someone that i dont want any commitment or relationship. took the doors off my fucking bed and decided it was too hard to move any farther, so thats my dads job now. im waiting for jon to go and pick up my bed set for me. got some crazy girl following me around last night at bounce. meghan called me RIGHT AFTER i got there. *sigh* shes supposed to call me this week though :D ummm..... my face still hurts. i have a bruise on the bridge of my nose from a table. also got told yesterday that the car should be put up for sale for 6 to 800 and im like fuck that i can get 1200 from some idiot. its in better condition than my dad thinks. i need a cigarette. i also need some pain killers....

ummmmm i find it funny when people lie and tell people shit and then expect the person to still be their friend. and i also like how people call people whores and then lie to their faces. i ALSO like how im going to a strip bar on tuesday to get drunk... and then have a doctors appointment the next morning... shoot me. this is the most random post ever... for awhile.."

I'm not your baby girl 
I've done ugly things
And I have made mistakes 
And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines 
I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed

So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word
Nothing ever smells of roses that rides out of mud 

Why do you love me
Why do you love me
Why do you love me
It's driving me crazy
 
Why do you love me

You're not some baby boy 
Why you acting so surprised 
You're sick of all the rules 
Well I'm sick of all the lies 
Now I've held back a wealth of shit
I think I'm gonna choke 
I'm standing in the shadows
With the words stuck in my throat 
Does it really come as a surprise
When I tell you I don't feel good
That nothing ever came from nothing man
Oh man ain't that the truth 

Why do you love me
Why do you love me

I get back up and I do it again 
I get back up and I do it
Do it again 

I think you're sleeping with a friend of mine 
I have no proof
But I think that I'm right

And you've still got the most beautiful face 
It just makes me sad
Most of the time

I get back up and I do it again 
I get back up and I do it again 
I get back up and I do it again 
I get back up and I do it
Do it again 
Do it again 
Do it again 
Do it again

My thoughts are so tempting
I don't know how it got so bad

so yea today was too long to even speak of and second off i dont want to. the most i can say is it all lead to me running for the first time since high school. and not just anywhere, but from strawberry to buttermilk falls or whatever it is. 5 and something miles.. an hour worth of running. the only reason i know that is because i used to run it once a week for cross country if not more. then a trip to squires and i ran up that fucking steep hill and almost fell on my ass and then around the circle.. im still freaking out..

some weird facts that probably few of you know: i love The Breakfast Club. and Sixteen Candles. hell i love molly ringwald movies... yea im a loser but fuck you. 

I really have to get shit figured out... i gotta get myself back. i really have to fucking solve my own problems. so dont expect me popping up much and talking..

i hate myself.."

"event","does anyone remember this song?


the cranberries 'zombie' 

Another head hangs lowly, 
Child is slowly taken. 
And the violence caused such silence, 
Who are we mistaken? 

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family. 
In your head, in your head they are fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are crying... 

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, 
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head, 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, dou, dou, dou, dou, dou... 

Another mother's breakin', 
Heart is taking over. 
When the vi'lence causes silence, 
We must be mistaken. 

It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen. 
In your head, in your head they're still fighting, 
With their tanks and their bombs, 
And their bombs and their guns. 
In your head, in your head, they are dying... 

In your head, in your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie, 
Hey, hey, hey. What's in your head, 
In your head, 
Zombie, zombie, zombie? 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh, ya, ya-a...

Wake up
My love
Never thought you'd make me, break me
Now I'm up from below
Such a brilliant star you are
And will your love keep burning baby
Burn a hole right through my eyes
All these short times feel like no time
I thought you ought to know
I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now
Do you wanna take me on?

Do, Do you, Do you know?
Do you know how long I've waited?
To look up from below,
Just to find someone like you?
And will your love light burn me baby?
Burn a hole right through my heart
I think I might just trust you, maybe
But I'm not sure
I'm not sure I wanna know

I'm so far gone now I been running on empty
I'm so far gone now
Do you wanna take me on?

Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
I think you could make me girl
Could make me and take my life
I know you could break me girl
Take all of me
All of me, yeah hey

Wake up 
My love
Never thought you'd make me, break me
Now I'm up from below
Such a brilliant star you are

 kinda mad at this moment in time, it happens when someone starts to treat you like you're a piece of shit and dont deserve any respect. and im sure thats going to be denied too and say im over reacting... when im not! but in other news.. i got different pills which makes me happy, sad though because i was stupid enough to stop taking them and then ill be a hormonal mess again. stupid ass me..

i suddenly had this crazy memory of me and rach driving around and just smoking and fucking venting.. when she finally admitted something to me and i to her.. and its crazy because it happened at the same time.. but then again shit just doesnt always work out for both of us..


ill edit this later.. at the moment i cant think...

{continuing 10:20} 

fuck you and everyone else.

continuing on... saturday is the day to go and get rachel.. and then sunday will be my second day off.. and then monday and tuesday.. i dont want that many days but what the fuck ever.. ill live.. i really have nothing to say..."

"event","Someday I'm going to bite into a york pepperment pady and actually live the sensation of all those things we all dream about... I'm going to put down my whiskey glass and raise my head to the setting sun and say, ""here's to you, you son of a bitch"" and then piss all over the newly grown grass. I'll curse the warm rays that settle upon my cheeks. I'll rape mother earth and take from her everything I deserve... and I won't feel sorry for it. Life's to short for apologies... they make you weak. And besides no one really cares if you apologize; they just want to piss all over you too. Yeah, it's one of those days - and why not? The gin tastes good and the ice is fully stocked. And at the end of the day, when the stars come out and the little girls and boys have all gone to bed I'll walk the streets, barefoot, but certain of the road beneath my feet."

"event","Today I was walking down fifth avenue when... alright... I'm lying already.  I'm in vermont. I have not been near the city since Saturday during an extremely horrid attempt at finding a job. From now on I'll let the job come to me. 
I want to talk about someone but I don't want to embarrass that person, especially if things are spelled wrong in this entry and their name is mentioned - that kind of thing would embarrass anyone.  SO - when I am talking about Vanessa, my girlfriend I'll use her initials ""V.T."" and for myself I'll use ""J.C."" - and hopefully no one will know who I am really talking about.

Today I, JC, longed to climb the hills of VT.  Longed to be brushed by VT's luscious abundant beauty. After all, what is better than hiking through VT (the state - wink wink, they'll never get it Vanessa, hee, hee) Yes, I do love VT. 

P.S. Craig - hope Long Island is cookin' with Meltzer juice!"

"event","Perhaps the best way to beat the situation is to create your own.  ""Always kick the moose in the head before he trampels over your rib cage"" was a saying my grandfather used to say - and you know what? I think he was right. Imagine a girl named Ceci; italian, dark haired, big green eyes, more beautiful than all cliches combined, and then imagine that she's yours. However you cannot be near to her... you can only think about her. The energy exchanged between the two of you must suffice until you <i>can</i> see her. Now comes the moose part: when will you see her? You do not know! You love her - More than all those cliches again.  So here's what you do: you kick the moose no matter what, even if he will never threaten to trample on your rib cage, and maybe, just mabye, it'll all work out.  If not, there's always those contests on TV, i.e. Top Model. 

What'll I do... when you... are far away...and no one's near... what'll I do...?

Order a Sex in Vermont: one finger of pine trees, another finger of apple cider doughnuts, a splash of ill-walled loft, and a dash of candle light, and of course, always on ice. Shaken. Serving size: 2"

"event","Yesterday a trip to the apple barn to escape from the endeavors of one of those lovely family get-togethers - you know the ones I mean... the step-father's family, none of whom you know, nor truly want to.  The brother with his rich girlfriend, they met at Dartmouth and so their eloquence far surpasses the trumpery at our dinner table.  The sister who you could swear is actually the grandmother, then you have to remind yourself that they all actually lived through the second world war and you were not misconstruing your dates.  15 food platters each equipped to give stomach pains to 35 people for the next several hours, not to mention the strange green gelatin/fruit dish brough by the Dartmouth's.  Yes.  Vanessa and I went to get apple cider at the apple bar, and sitting on a bench overlooking the mountains we both knew it was our chance.  The fence was short and flimsy and the mountains so inviting - just get up and run - become people of the woods.  Instead, we polished off the cider and tracked home in the car following the bits of cheese dropped from the platter - you know to find our way back - running away is always such a trivial thing - good to have a backup just in case."

To eyes kissing and lips watching!"

"event","This guy at work is an asshole.

The other day the owner of the car parked behind him didn't put their handbrake on properly.  The car slowly crept up to his.  Later that day he found them touching. 

He went back inside to get a digital camera and took photos of the incident so that he could make grief for the owner of the wayward vehicle.  Attempts made to page the owner failed.

This is the asshole part:

Without chocking the wheels of the offending car he then drove off - leaving it to roll down the hill into the next vehicle along."

Dreamt that I was camping and was getting flooded.  It persisted with rain last night.

I have a Chinese lecturer called Ken.  He does a great job but has a thick accent.  I can't help but smirk sometimes.

I haven't really messed with the new expansion much, since I'm trying to finish up THF before I go any farther in the game, but I took the time to complete the opening quest and visit the new city. So far? Pretty nice, actually. The new jobs seemed to have turned out really well, with Blue Mage leading the fields in popularity. I haven't really decied if I ever wanted to level any of the new jobs, since they all seem to be crazy expensive, but the Blue Mage seems like a decent choice. I mean, who wouldn't like a job that can learn monster skills, and then use those monster skills to attack other monsters? Corsair and Puppetmaster seem okay, but I haven't really read much into their job classes yet.

On a side note, finished the first of my three massive databases at work. I'm currently finishing up a little side project I hope to have completed by Saturday before moving onto another database. ._.

I've also been playing a little PS2 and Grandia III. Really nice game, beautiful CG sequences, and the battle-system is pretty nice as well."

"event","My deepest apologies for not updating this journal as I should. I know that I do have friends out there who still want to know what I'm into, and how everything's going on my end, so my apologies for not keeping you folks as informed as I should.

Life: Things have been rather interesting in this department since the beginning. Work has turned from something I loathed even talking about, to something I rather enjoy doing, thanks to a recent job change. Going from just plain, manual labor to administrating databases for a world-wide company is quite a jump, and if you had told me that last year I'd have laughed in your face. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I'd get to do something so complex, meet so many new and wonderful people, and actually enjoy the place that I work. I mean, honestly, working for a parent isn't exactly the best of situations to be in, but right now I'm the happiest I've been in a long time. The money's nice, the hours are nice, and the people are great. Also, as it turns out, I'm not half bad at this whole database stuff. And to think, I've never touched MS Access in my life. :D

Bel and I? We're doing just fine. She's been working quite a bit at her new job, which I'll poke her until she writes you guys up something about it, and getting things ready for school. Yeap, she was accepted to my university! Woot! So, she's been gearing up for that, getting her ducks in a row, and whatnot. She's also been playing FFXI with me quite a bit, which is really nice. Her family situations' have calmed down quite a bit, and everyones', except one's, lives seem to be in good shape right now.

Game: Honestly, I don't even know why I walked away from FFXI all those months ago. The game is still one of the most fun MMO's I've ever had the chance to play. Yes, it's even better than WoW (well, better in most cases, worst in some, but eh). I've been leveling my Warrior/Ninja for a good while, and getting all sorts of new equipment I never had the chance before to get. Also, this week my old guild is starting up a Promathia mission run, which is awesome because the storyline of this game is pretty in-depth. The missions, the battles, the story out-tops WoW ten fold. But, since most of you folks are totally into WoW, I won't go into a great detail. Basically, me = having fun, and that's all that matters.

So, as a side note, I just wanted to say thanks for all the fun and memories on WoW. My account is officially dead, as of today, so you'll never see my shining face anymore on that game. I tried to login over the weekend, to say my last goodbyes and all, but the servers simply wouldn't cooperate. They're seriously going to lose some business if they keep denying people their right to play. New authentication system is a MUST. And also, Bel has canceled her WoW account as well. She simply doens't have time to play WoW, since most of the stuff you guys do is so late at night. Her words? 'School's coming up, and I work too much to play that game.' So, sorry guys, but it looks like you're losing us both. :( Letto, don't go all insane again and get upset with us, please. :( We're sorry, but we're trying to do things that fit best into our lives. If you folks ever give FFXI a whirl, simply let us know and we'll help you get onto our server.

And that's that. Promised fulfilled. G'night everyone~!

P.S. - Letto, I haven't been ignoring your MSN windows. :( You just message me when I'm AFK in the mornings. :/"

"event","Maybe it's just me, but since when did a guild tag above your head label you? I'm so sick and tired of being hassled over what guild I joined, who they are, who's in it, everything. I'm sick of it. It's a tag. It's a name. It's a place to achieve the items I never thought I'd ever have a chance at. Why must everyone judge me by what guild I go to? So I didn't stay where you wanted me to, but does that make me less of a man, a person, or a friend? To some, yes, it would seem so. They simply can't get the idea out of their head that I'm the same exact person as before, just under a different label.

I'm terribly sorry if I've upset you all by going someplace that was actually doing the things I want to do, and can do them easily, but goddamnit I pay my $14 each month just like you. I love you all, but if you can't accept who I am, and where I am, then fuck off."

"event","Letto told me I had to this; History, a la Deadlocke.

What's there to say about me that you haven't guessed within the first five minutes of talking with me? I'm a fourth generation American, although I'd prefer to be Irish. My great great grandparents came from Irish/English heritage, making the move to the new continent back in our colonizational period. Presently, I reside in the beautiful, yet backwards, state of Kentucky. Not that it's a terribly awful place to live, but Kentucky does have its drawbacks. Apprently, here, you can't do much of anything without the 'Blessing of the Lord', and by 'do much' I mean things that would generally cause chaos to a moderately to heavily religious community. And, just so we're all clear on this, I am presently an ape descendant, or a hu-man as you other hu-mans would put it.

Am I religous? Yes. I was raised in a very strict calvanist sect of the Baptist religion, but I've quickly drove myself away from its binding rules and outdated laws. Although I do believe in heaven, hell, and the concept of God, I do not believe there is one true religion. Live your life well, be kind to others when you can, and always believe there's someone up there no matter what situation you find yourself in, good or bad, and you'll be fine. Although the majority of my family would very strongly disagree, I believe, considering most of them are either preachers or practicioneers of the religious sect I mentioned earlier.

I do travel, but I've never been on a grand adventure. I'd have to say that the farthest I've ever wandered in the States would be to Florida (Disney World as a kid...oh the horrors..), but I'm well-versed in the back-paths and untravelled roads of the Kentucky 'outback' and that's gotta count for something.

Hobbies? Sure, I've got them. Aside from my obvious divings into the realm of the virtual, I'm an avid reader and writer. I do enjoy books that tend to bend the imagination quite a bit, being a huge Sci-Fi and Fantasy fan, and books that challenge you to accept the truths and morals of the world around you. Oh, and I practically adore a good book that challenges religion, God, and the whole aspect of 'church'. I love hiking and exploring places people generally never explore, and I have a tendency to be an avid collector of seeing covered bridges. Odd hobby, right?

Music? Yeap, I love it. Sitting in a little folder on my desktop, aptly named 'Music', is around five gigabytes of music that, erm, downloaded. So, in theory, I could play a different song every five minutes for three days without ever repeating the same song twice. And that doesn't count my other collection that's stored on an old computer at my folk's house. I'm an avid listener to every genre of music, so long as I can understand the lyrics and it all makes sense to me. Country, Jazz, BlueGrass, Folk, Rock, etc. Although, I do have a weakness for the classical works of music, but that just stems from a period of three years of my life in which I listen to absolutely nothing but classical pieces of music.

Other than everything mentioned above, I'm naturally a very laid back person who stresses over nothing. I am in a long-term relationship, love good friends and laughter, always in a mood for 'fun', horny until the day I die, and loyal to the cause. And I think that's enough about me. Sorry if I rambled, but I was stuck at home and decently bored enough to go in-depth with all this.

Oh, and Letto? I agree with your synopsis of the fall of the Roman Empire. And grunt, if you read this, add me to your bloody friends list. I can't comment on your enteries, and it's making me sad. :("

"event","Bored at the moment, since I'm at home thanks to certain circumstances at work. So, I thought I'd stop in and write in my LJ before I go off to clean up a bit more.

Tidbits. Went to my morning math class, learned a little, hated it a lot, then went to the bank. Stopped at Arbys and secured a melted chedder roast beef sammich (for Bel), and a chicken sammich (me), along with drinks and curly fries, and ran home. Ate, made a few people laugh, and farmed felcloth with Alchy.

Now Alchy's gone, and I finished farming up enough felcloth so he can make his bag. Oooh, won't he be excited. :D

Prediction: Alch's going to move in with Bel and I, and we're going to take a trip to see a certain loverly girl in Canada. Romance will happen, smoochies, and they'll be a wedding in Las Vegas. Matt and I will get totally drunk, end up spending our entire fortunes on a bad hand at blackjack, but somehow win it all back with incredible luck at the slots. Gogo quaters!

Also, since I want to end this horrible abuse of the english language of a post, I found this old video of a warlock bug that use to be on the server. See the warlock. See the warlock summon a felhunter. See the warlock kill EVERYONE around her at the AH. Muw. :)

"event","I sit at my desk, swinging my legs in beat with the music pouring from my speakers. Rain beast steadily against the window next to me, with each new drop causing the others to fall in nothing short of a symphony of rebirth and death. The new replacing the old. The rain always makes me think, always reflect. I sit back and wonder about what I'm doing with my life, where I'm at, who I am, and who I'm with. And this morning, my thoughts? I'm happy. Incredibly happy, actually. Sure, I wish things were better for the both of us, that I could give her everything she's wanting or wanted, but listening to her angelic voice singing and humming along to the music that fills the room, I know that I am. She's happy, and that's all that really matters. If she only knew how hard I tried to make her happy, it might surprise her, but she lives with me. I don't think anything could surprise her at this point. :)

In other news, things have been going very well. School's started back this week, so I'm getting used to my schedule again. Luckly today, the first day, everything was delayed because of weather. Seriously, I woke up at 6:30 to a raging wind and freezing rain, so you can understand how happy I was to hear that classes were cancelled. Work-wise, my nightly job is still there. I absolutely hate it, loathe it, to every extreme possible, but it does pay quite well so I'll continue to do it until ole Dad doesn't have a use for me anymore. What do I do? Basically? Anything he commands me to do. I do this, do that, anything he requests. I'm his bitch, and because I'm not that gifted with tools or hardware, I'm usually given the most 'gruntish' type of work available, which is usually the hardest or most dirtest. I'm not saying he's fair, because he does give everyone else their fair share of it too, its just that I seem to get the most of it all. My university job just seems to be getting better and better. Last night my boss, whom I trained, called me up wanting me to work this afternoon between classes. I agreed too, then she just poured into tears because no one is giving her the respect she needs. No one is showing up for shifts, picking up schedules, or even caring about work period. Then she informed me that she's going to apply for another job on campus, hopefully land it, and leave this one far behind. And if she does, I'm so going for it. Sure the job is boring, the pay is crap, but it is full-time -with- benefits. Not to mention that I've been doing the job for three years, I know everything about it, and that I have to train anyone and everyone that's new to the position. Why not just take it for myself?

In WoW news, we kicked off Sunday with our new permanent raiding schedule. UBRS, Strath Dead, Scholo, Strath Live, and LBRS, Sunday through Thrusday, and Saturday in that order. Nice showing last night, with almost everyone in the raid being from CotD and Strife. Also, I talked with a new friend of mine, Niya, from Unnature Axe, and Domnu and I are invited to come to their ZG raid this Thrusday. Hopefully some good times to be had there, even if we do whipe, its always fun to meet new people.

Anywoo, I need to make up the bed and clean-up a bit upstairs. <3 to all.

Sing songs, dance along,
Groove with Allen"

"event","Yeap. That's where I'm currently writing from this morning. Evidently, their secretary is out sick for the day so I get to sit in here and do her work because 'we need somebody'. The only problem is, I haven't actually navigated this network, these systems, or work their phone systems in about three months. Things are going to get -really- interesting if it gets busy later on in the day. I was told I'd only be in here a couple of hours, but I believe they're going to make me sit here all day. :( Oh well..money is money after all, and I'm getting paid to sit on my ass. :D

In other news, I don't know if you folks browse around the internet much, or keep up with all the chatter, but there's a huge web battle raging between two reigning kings of internet comedy; eBaumsworld and YTMND.com (You're the Man Now Dog.com). I've always, always been a huge fan of YTMND simply because their users put out some of the most original content I've ever seen. Most of it is just simple crap, but there are users of their site that really invest a lot of time and effort into their funny, yet meaningless, creations. So, getting back to my story, it has long been known that eBaumsworld regularly rips off internet media creators (the people who make funny gifs or animations) by throwing their watermark on a work of art not their own and hosting it, thus in an attempt to make it their own. Recently, eBaums ripped off a work entitled 'Lindsay Lohan never changes facial expressions' created by a YTMND user. The GIF in question simply showed different pictures of Lindsay Lohan in which she used the exact same facial expression, tuned to the music of Eric Prydaz's 'Call On Me'. Quite original, and quite true. The woman never does change facial expressions at all. Anyway, YTMND users went into a rage spamming eBaums forums with randomness, insults, threats, spam, anything and everything they could get their hands on. They've launched DDOS attacks, packet attacks, even attempting to break into their website to change content. I mean, its been a bloody war for about a week. Not to mention the simple fact that eBaumsworld is pretty much ran by a teenager who, in a letter to the webmaster of YTMND, used the word 'LOL!'. I don't know if any of you can even follow what I'm talking about, but its something that's, for me, been really fun to watch. Two sites duking it out over a simple piece of computer art... welcome to the modern age.

In WoW news, I've been slowly and continously ugrading my rogue over the past two weeks by leading nightly raids with CotD. Not that I wasn't equipped before, mind you, but I've just been completing my shadowcrafter set (of which I actually use very little), odd weapons, daggers, enchanting items, and fire/nature resist gear. Last night I decided to farm up the reputation to get my epic wolf mount for my rogue. I think it'd be pretty freakin' sweet to see a big sack of bones riding around a swift wolf. I'm around 4k from revered with Org, so only a TON more to go. I figured I'd take advantage of this new war effort event to raise my fishing and cash in on the yellowspotted tail market. It beats the silly runecloth quest thats the norma, and its worth a LOT more reputation. Or maybe I'll just continue to farm out WPL and EPL for rune and turn that in. Pretty easy to get over a hundred clothes pers hour.

Anyways, that's enough rambling for me. Since I'm stuck at work and unable to supply screenshots, here's a nice little link instead.

"event","Where's the year gone to? I mean, really, it seems like just yesterday that Belinda and I moved into our two-bedroom home. Oh well, another minute, another hour, another day, another year. In the grand scheme of things, it all seems inconsequential that another year has passed us by, simply because this new year will just become another new year far too soon than any of us want it to. Hopefully, you managed to accomplish everything you wanted to do this year, and if you didn't, just attach that list onto your new year's list of things you really want to do.

Did any of that make sense to you? Doubtfully, but the moral of my story is to stop attaching lists onto lists of things you want to do, and just do them. Carpe diem, and all that crap.

So, what is this little place? A record, of sorts, but mostly an idea. Belinda and I had the idea of all of our dearest friends coming together, under one roof, to document the legends, the stories, the tales of our accomplishments both in life and in a virtual world. Whether you choose to take part in this little idea or not is completely up to you, but wouldn't it be nice to see our lives pass by in text and/or pictures? Little insights into the mind, little photographs of times come and gone, little memories and collections of time.

So, let's begin. Gamewise, CotD has really been taking off with new people and new instances. Zul'Gurub, Molten Core, all that kind've stuff. It's amazing to think that when I first joined their ranks I was on the verge of quitting, simply because I didn't think I fit in, but now I could never leave all of my aussie lovers... even if they are guys!

Anywoo, picture time~!

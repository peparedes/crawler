"event","i was just upstairs talking to ashley about my father and i thought it was rather interesting that the earliest and only memory i have of him actually showing some sort of emotion towards me was three years ago. it was september 11th and i had been at school and i had to walk home alone because ashley had detention, my mother was at work, and he never picks us up from school. after the long ass 45 minute walk i reached the driveway and he was in the garage. i walked up to him, still confused about what was going on because i hadnt heard all the facts and just knew the twin towers were hit, all i said was ""whats going on?"" and he said ""i dont know"" and hugged me. its a good memory but sad to think thats the only one i have of him. the fact that he admitted he never took responsibility for ashley or i kills me. well...he has to play poker...so im off."

"event","so yes today was fun. i did a shitload of psych homework...the scary thing being that i wanted to. ashley and i went to dennys after school. john and chen were there. anyway, whitney eventually got there and grayson and alec also came up. after that kyle showed up so it was just one big party. kyle john and chen left and then grayson had to take alec to work but he came back right after. then ashley and whitney left so our little group was shrinking...it was just grayson and i. of course he just had to bring up the night i met him like that jackass he is. but hes a funny jackass so i guess it doesnt matter. anyway i called abi and she was on her way so i was happy. when she got there grayson had to leave so it was just the two of us and we called john and told him to come back. we had to bribe him though so we told him we'd show him our chesticles but we DIDNT muahaha. probably one of the reasons he hates women. but holy crap i had so much fun with those two. maybe the ten refills of dr.pepper had something to do with it but yeah it was fun. dont you just love masterbating in public resteraunts...dont ask. anyway it got to be 9 so we ended our fabulous dennys day. man it was fun. wow i almost forgot that i danced with john to no music at the register."

You are<br>an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for<br>one reason or another - possibly, you made one<br>tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or<br>maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't<br>commit. In any case, you are faithless and<br>joyless. You find no happiness, love, or<br>acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most<br>days are a burden and you wonder when the<br>hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and<br>sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching<br>picture. You are the one that few understand.<br>Those that do know you are likely to love you<br>deeply and wish that they could do something to<br>ease your pain. You are constantly living in<br>memories of better times and a better world.<br>You are hard on yourself and self-critical or<br>self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved,<br>you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite<br>your tainted nature, your soul is<br>breathtakingly beautiful.

"event","well yes at the moment, obviously from the subject line, i am in connecticut. i have had so much fun the past two days. we were supposed to fly in on thursday but due to the fact that we were using buddy passes [standby tickets that cost only $50 and put you at the bottom of the standby list] we didnt make any of the possible flights. Friday we made the first possible flight only because my mother made us all act like we were twelve so we could be concidered unacompanied minors. yes..i believed it...hah. but yes we got to hartford around 3:30 connecticut time. My cousin Gina's boyfriend, Bob, picked us up. Yes, his name is Bob...hes awsome...shut up. So yeah the first thing we did was went by Gina's house to drop off all of our shit. Once we got all settled we went to see Gina at her place of work. She works at Bertucci's. Bertucci's is a badass italian brick oven pizza restaraunt. you can actually watch them put the pizza in the oven thingy. its p-i-m-p. yeah anyway after that bob took us to blockbuster and we rented Empire Records, The Exorcist, and Nightmare on Elm Street. We watched Empire Records and Nightmare on Elm Street that night but were saving the Exorcist for later tonight. I fell asleep three quarters of the way through Nightmare on Elm Street. 

Saturday- Gina woke me up at ten for donuts but i fell asleep again and she woke me up at noon. I took a shower and we eventually headed over to bobs. he lives with three other guys plus his little brother was visiting from Vermont. Bob is 25 and his brother, Andy, is 22. My cousin Gina is 28. so yeah im going off topic again. We were waiting for Jason to get back from wherever he was so we could all go to the party. Jason is one of bobs roommates. They are all in the navy. There is Bob, Jason, Renee [probably spelled wrong], and Greg, who was out of town or something. Once Jason got home we went to the party and there were a ton of people. Whitney and i got completly wasted. it was great. there was another really creepy guy also named jason. he was thirty, so he says, and he wanted to give us a ride home. buuut yeah when we got back to Bob's we watched Red Dragon and SE7EN muahaha. yeah ashley went to bed first but whitney, andy, and i stayed up to finish SE7EN. once that was over me and whit went and we tried to sleep. we were staying in gregs room and his bed is incredibly unconmfortably and noisy. whit got to sleep but around 4 or 5 i moved back to the tv room and andy was passed out on the sofa so i layed down on the other one. i woke him up but i didnt mean to. whit and i had gone to gregs room at three when the movie was over...then i went to the tv room at 4 or 5...couldnt sleep...jason came in and talked [whispered] to me at 6:30 on his way to work...still couldnt sleep...went out and had a smoke...still couldnt sleep...talked to renee...then everyone else woke up. 

Sunday- soooo yeah after that we eventually went into middletown to see my grandmother and aunt. i havnt seen them in a year and ive missed them so much. i also saw my uncle for a few minutes when he was dropping off a television. yeah hes not really a talkative one. anyway after that we came back here, gina's house, and realized that Pheobe, the cat, had puked everywhere because someone had shut the door to the basement and thats where she poops/pisses/and pukes when needed. so we had to clean that shit up and yeah it was nasty as FUCK. so now my aunt and uncle just returned from Atlantic City so im going to go talk to them. 

love you all...

"event","This morning and last night were very fun indeed. At around 6:30 whitney picked ashley and i up and we went to dennys like usual. Whitney had to leave around 7:15 because she was going downtown to see sneak preview type thing of Napoleon Dynamite. I really want to know how that went by the way. So she left and ashley and i were left anone. We thought that crystal was coming right up to dennys but then all of this other stuff came up so they didnt show up for about an hour. that turned out fine though because Abi showed up about ten minutes after whitney left. later on throughout the evening Everyone came. Crystal, Travis, Gualda, Kristi, John, Michael, Grayson, Maggie, and some girl i dont know. Greg and Logan even stopped in to say hello. that cheered me up because i never see them anymore and they are awsome kids. i love them. so yes anyway eventually everyone except John, Michael, and Abi, plus we knew that Abi was staying at our house so it was pretty much just us three ladies and the McCaskill brothers. It was fun none the less. We asked John to give us a ride home, he did but almost skipped our house. It was rather humorous. 

So anyway, Abi had never seen Bowling for Columbine so we decided to watch it. Although, we did get sidetracked because i decided to show her some of the quizes i took and she had never taken them. so of course i let her. But yes we had decided earlier while still in my room that we were all going to sneak out. so we stayed downstairs untill my father went to sleep. went upstairs, had a smoke, then left. Chris picked us up by the park and ben called me to tell me to meet him at the dead end by samanthas house because he had gotten the Dro that we asked for earlier at Dennys. We went and waited for about ten minutes because he took FOREVER to get out of Sammy's house, but it was worth it. After getting it we all went back to Chris's house. Oh yes, i forgot to mention who was with chris. Jack, Tyler, Krist, and the Jew were all with him when he picked us up. Ashley, Abi, Jack, and I all sat in the bed of the truck and the breeze felt great. Anyway, im going off topic like usual...well, Abi and i got Jack's pipe and we both just kept loading bowl after bowl. i got so fucked up it was amazing. Plus we had taken some of my adderall so we werent tired. None of us slept last night. We had some of the best conversations ive ever been a part of. It made me smile."

"event","i hate you. when was the last time you showed me or ashley any sign that you care. when we were...three maybe? i cant even remember...you are a lazy fucking bastard. stop bitching about money, get off your ass and get a god damn job. Stop playing online poker. It is incredibly depressing for me whenever someone asks what you do. guess what i tell them. i say that youre a fucking lazy ass. you prefer to play a fake game with fake money pretending its real. you like to bitch at me for pointless shit. the blanket thing this morning...why the fuck would i put away a blanket that I WAS USING. in the words of mr.manson [who i know you hate] 

""i dont need a reason to hate you the way i do""

although i have many reasons. fuck off and die. i have no care in the world for you. i never have. stop drinking...youre not a very nice alcoholic...actually...youre not very nice in general. remember when you and mom were going to get a divorce...i regret stopping you. you make my life miserable. people ask me about you...i tell them i dont have a father. thats pretty much how it is. you dont talk to me unless you have something to bitch at me. FUCK YOU"

Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,

You, my brown-eyed girl. 
Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio.
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall,
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl. 

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah. 

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own.
I saw you just the other day,
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord,
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Laughing and running hey, hey
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl. 

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee

"event","so yes. i have decided to stop [for now] with the quizes and actually write. 

i am pretty blah feeling right now...why? because of chris. i cant get him out of my mind. i havnt seen him since christmas. i love him. i really do. and it sucks because hes changed so much and hes such an asshole now but im stuck on thinking he will change but i know he wont. he wont talk to me anymore. he told me hed love me forever...but thats obviously not true...and its killing me. i have so many awsome people that i could be goin for ya know but ARG. hes always in the back of my mind. everyone tells me that hes not going to be himself again...or at least the chris that i knew. and i know that. but for some reason i cant realize it. its hard when you love someone. but...hes ignoring me now. hopefully ill find someone new...but he will probably make me fuck that up somehow also [if there ever IS a ""that""] im so pessemistic sometimes.

so yes anyway...out of no where about 15 minutes ago i decided to get ordained. i should be recieving a confirmation letter within the next two business days. im very excited. when i do get it i will be sure to post it for all to see. 

i also decided that i was going to marry chen. my asian friend with the tiny wang. 

holy shit...im talking to him..he actually replied. chris that is. i texted him from online to his phone and he didnt reply at first but now...hes talking to me...

<font color=""white"">me:</font> why have you been ignoring me?
<font color=""white"">me:</font> okay obviously that was pointless seeing how you are ignoring me but i just want to talk to you. i dont care anymore if you dont feel the same way you did about me [im lying there] i just want to be your friend. thats all i care about right now is your friendship.
<font color=""white"">him:</font> i always hurt you so i dont want to hurt you.
<font color=""white"">me:</font> youre hurting me by not talking to me. i just want to talk to you thats all. you never have time to talk to me anymore.

~long moment of no responce~

<font color=""white"">me:</font> hello?

and thats where im at right now. how exciting. gaaah please just respond you bastard! he knows what hes doing. he knows this is going to drive me crazy. why isnt he responding. good mother fucking lord i hate this! hah look at the way im talking right after submitting a form for ordination. im a terrible person...well if he ever replies ill be sure to post it.."

"event","<P>Why hello again,</P>
<P>Now that ive tried to get all my journal settings the way i want, i feel it is time to update.&nbsp; I am very excited.</P>
<P>recently, ive had a slight problem with insomnia.&nbsp; i guess the fact that it is 3 in the morning is an extraordinary example of one of the&nbsp;phases&nbsp;boredom my mind has gone through. i never thought there could be multiple ""phases"" of boredom, but you'll find out different if you stay awake non-stop <EM>just</EM> long enough. All of my days lately have melted into one continuous day of confusion. The sun. the moon. the sun. the moon. what day is it? the sun. the moon...such repetition can drive you insane. i hadn't realized how <EM>annoying</EM> the earth's rotation could possibly be. anyway ill stop talking about that now.</P>
<P>I am leaving for Connecticut <FONT color=#cc33cc>[MY HOME!] </FONT><FONT color=#000000>on the twenty second along with ashley and whitney. i cant wait. it shall be grand.</FONT></P>
<P>holy cheese and crackers...most of you have heard about my ghost's, im sure. if you havnt, well...my house, mainly the second floor, is haunted. Although i dont like to say haunted.&nbsp;The word haunted is so often used&nbsp;to mean an&nbsp;omnipotent,&nbsp;evil spirit crawling out of the darkness to eat your&nbsp;babies...&nbsp;or something to that nature, so id rather just say that they are just chillin', not haunting. but yes, i am the only person awake in the house and maybe its the sleep deprivation but i keep hearing a little girl screaming...its kinda creepy.&nbsp;alright...yeah it&nbsp;happened again...and louder. RIGHT off that topic before i shit my pants...&nbsp;the entire Group of Doom has realized that i am not going insane when i speak of my ghosts. they have all at one point or another heard them.&nbsp; here are some of the things they do...</P>
<UL>
<LI>the wall that my closet is on is the wall shared with the guest bedroom, on the other wall would be ashley's room. all through the night they would bang on the walls from inside of my closet. i would get up and check and everyone would be asleep, no one in the guest room.</LI>
<LI>once they got bored of the closet they moved onto scratching/tapping along the walls, back and forth, all night. it gets rather annoying.</LI>
<LI>the g.o.d. has all been visited by ""the coin ghost"". crystal was the first of the four of us to have the company of the coin ghost. this was back in the day when she was still dating wiggly-tuff [dont ask]. but yes, the coin ghost likes to fuck with your mind...he throws coins [pennies, nickels, dimes] at you. the thing is they fall from above you and hit you, usually and the head in my case. this even happened to me once outside. i was in the middle of a field and a damn nickel hit me on the head. those damn things hurt.</LI></UL>
<P>but yes, those are a few things that my ghost like to do. some people like to say that it is just rats or something little that can live in the walls. yes, because i know of so many rats that can forcefully pound a wall with their muscular little rat-hands. let alone a rat that can scream like a girl...</P>
<P>well to sum up my day...it was interesting. i went with my mother to wall mart when she got done at the doctors and i got:</P>
<OL>
<LI>a black with yellow and pink poka-dotted&nbsp;skirt [its really cute]</LI>
<LI>comfy little shorts that i happen to be wearing <FONT color=#99ffff>RIGHT NOW</FONT> : )</LI>
<LI>an awesome&nbsp;bra...it makes these damn things look very perky haha</LI>
<LI>a blue/purple/black bandanna</LI>
<LI>a&nbsp;Saves the Day cd</LI></OL>
<P>and yeah my mom got some stuff she needed. i was very dissapointed... i was having a conversation with my mother in the car [on the way to wally-world] and we were talking about ""Bowling for Columbine"".&nbsp; i had started watching it one day with crystal whenever we went with travis to the house he is taking care of. its a really good movie and i havn't even finished it yet. some of the statistics are mind-boggling. but yeah, wal-mart, of all places, didnt have it. i thought that wal-mart could have anything one could ever want/need. but i was wrong...[sniffle]</P>
<P>well this turned into an extremely long first entry. im proud...</P>

i apologize to those few that sometimes take the time to read my rather boring pointless entries, <b>BUT</b>, it has come to my attention that there were many rather immature people going around causing journals to freeze up...including mine. <i>This</i>, is why i have decided to follow the crowd and turn this <i>NEW</i> journal into a ""friends only"" journal.

if you would like to read them and i feel you are worthy enough to wield the privilege of viewing these remarkable records of my life [or great lack of the above-said life], all you have to do is leave an informative little comment. I will try to write my first private entry later today. thank you and have a nice life.

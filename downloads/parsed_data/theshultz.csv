ah, my cute and wonderful little boyfriend never updates this...

tsk tsk tsk.
he won't let me update his IAM account... but because he never writes in this one (and since none of his friends read this) then i can update in it.
he hates me... 

okay. so maybe he doesn't really hate me.

okay... so maybe he <i>might</i> love me.

and honestly... i love him, so i suppose it doesn't matter how he feels. i will kidnap him and make him fall horribly in love with me until the end of time.

i've actually been here, at his house for about 4 days now. i get into the trap of falling asleep beside him... and not being able to fall asleep without him.
he's craving attention at the moment, so he's talking verra loud and making jokes. i love him.
he's also wearing the ""soothsayer"" shirt i bought for him several months ago from express. it makes him look ten times sexier than he does on an everday basis (which uhm... is pretty hard to do.)


they're getting ready to play risk (boys will be boys).
and while i'm all supportive of boy-time... i'm quite the impatient girl.
and i want to pounce my boyfriend!!! 

... mmm... now.

so aside from his first entry, i think this is the longest update there is.
unfortunately, it's not actually his update, but more of his girlfriend's.

his small little filipino girl who's horribly in love with the most amazing, crazy and adorable man ever.
and they lived happily after all...

"event","<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Brandon has taken it upon himself to destroy my health!!! Alright ""not so much"" but I do fell like shit!!! Seems like Ive gotten into a pattern as of late.&nbsp; Im good to go for a short while then out of nowhere BOOOOM virus.&nbsp; Fuck! From the time I was born to well after I graduated in 2001 I can count on my right hand how many times I have been sick!&nbsp; This year alone has exceeded that!!!&nbsp; First time I got strep throat... second time I got strep throat... ohh and yes the third time I got strep throat... Yep that'd all be this year!!!!!&nbsp; Im hoping that this TheraFlu shit works... I would hope to God it does something, if not I went throught that horrible horrible 5 minutes of trying to put down the 6 oz. of hell for nothing!!!&nbsp; I am waiting for my girlfriend to get back from a speech meet that her EX was also attending.&nbsp; Hmmm ....&nbsp; You may be asking yourself ...""Hey Shultz did she sit next to him&nbsp;during the 3 and a half hour ride there""... Why yes she did!&nbsp; Hmm ... ""Does that bother you"" ... Na I know who I am and he is not <STRONG>ME</STRONG>... And I trust her... What deos bother me is his attempts... Yet, I have been him so I know that he must... But none the less it crawls beneth me.&nbsp; I know he has hit her... I know he treated her like shit... Therefor I have no sympathy for his pain! NONE.&nbsp; That may seem callous and empty but I look down upon those who do not have respect for the ones they claim to ""love"".&nbsp; I am by no stretch of the imagination perfect... but I can hold my head high in knowing that in all of my relationships I have never betrayed anyone and in that I will never faulter...&nbsp; Loyalty is the most important thing in life... We all need people around us... without them life is empty.&nbsp; So trust is layed at the footsteps of those we call friends... If they trample upon your trust there us nothing left.&nbsp; Minus a good segway I have to say that<STRONG> ANY</STRONG> man that would hit&nbsp;<STRONG>ANY </STRONG>woman for <STRONG>ANY</STRONG> reason other that to protect his life is a coward and I would glady show them that... It makes me sick to my stomach to hear stories of any type of abuse but to look at a small frail little girl and lay your hands upon her enrages me.&nbsp; Ahhh I cant go on I am angering my self just thinking about it!!! </P>

"event","<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well it looks as if I am writing in a journal... Thats where you are mistaken... I am typing in a journal... And only out of bordom has this come to pass.&nbsp; I should be asleep now but something keeps me awake... I have absolutly no reason to write so I will just ramble on about this and that... I hate my job but it pays my bills... and now that I have a NEW Lancer Im kinda stuck for the time being... <A href=""mailto:FUCK!@#%"">FUCK!@#%</A>&nbsp; I need to get myself out of this shit!! Damn ... I curse alot... Ahh fuck it!!! There are times when I look at my job and Im just in a complete state of consternation... I know not whether to say fuck it and risk everything and try to be happy in my work... that would mean changing jobs and not possibly not making as much money... or sucking it up and just getting through this until I can work it out.&nbsp; Fuck if I know!... On the bright side, I do have an absolutly AMAZING girlfriend who I met at one of my shows, thanks to a kick ass drummer I know.&nbsp; She is an entity all her own!!! I stand in awe of this woman... And for me to say that is a rather BIG compliment.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am impressed by no one!!! Well, no one but her!!&nbsp; She astounds me in evey facet of her being... From her beautiful smile, to her tiny toes she is perfect.&nbsp; I love the way she looks at me, the way she caresses my back after a horrid day at work, the light in her eyes when she sees me open the door, the love in her embrace as we hold each other, the look back as I drop her off, her raised eyebrow when I have peaked her intrest, the words I Love You spoke from her lips pressed aginst my shoulder not wanting to let go, everything ... in a word everything about her amazes me.&nbsp; Hmmm mmmm m mmm!&nbsp; Thats for you baby!! I love you !!! Well I shall end this now but before I do a few words from Surge</P>
<P><STRONG>I have a problem that I cannot explain,<BR>I have no reason why it should've been so plain,<BR>Have no questions but I sure have excuse,<BR>I lack the reason why I should be so confused.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I know, how I feel when I'm around you,<BR>I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,<BR>Around you.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Left a message but it ain't a bit of use,<BR>I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce,<BR>Today you saw, you saw me, you explained,<BR>Playin the show and running down the plane.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I know, how I feel when I'm around you,<BR>I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,<BR>I know, how I feel when I'm around you,<BR>I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,<BR>Around you,</STRONG></P>

"event","I'm moving to Micronesia in july to teach high school (english most likely).  So hang out with me copiously for the next five months.  I think I'm leaving my computer in the states so I won't be an easy man to get in touch with.  But as colleen tells me, micronesia is still considered domestic in terms of mail from the days when the US was in control down there so it's cheap to send me things."

"event","Do you think your first love still loves you?
no.

How late did you stay up last night and why?
I was in bed around 12:30. &nbsp;It was an early night but I woke up at 4 so that doesn't really matter now does it?

How's your life lately?
all over the place.

What time is it?
5:52 am

Do you believe in love at first sight?
of course not.

Do you hate the last girl you were texting?
no it was colleen and she's pretty great.

Ever kissed anyone 18 or older?
hahaa yes. otherwise I think we'd be having some trouble with the law.

What are you listening to?
the cosby show in the background.

What was the last movie you watched?
(500) Days of Summer

When is the last time someone of the opposite sex gave you a hug?
yesterday

Has anyone disappointed you lately?
by leaps and bounds. &nbsp;but i think that's more my fault than anyone else's. &nbsp;I set the bar too high.

Do you have a good relationship with your siblings?
yes indeed! my sister is wonderful.

Wheres your phone?
under my pillow.

Whens the last time you wrote someone a letter?
too long ago. &nbsp;maybe november?

Why did you last cry?
because one of my best friends had died.

Is it ever too late to apologize?
for the most part, yes. I don't think it's ever too late to apologize in the sense of simply expressing your feelings. &nbsp;However it is very often too late to apologize and expect forgiveness. But I think we often overlook that for the sake of a friendship and choose to forgive anyway.&nbsp;

Have you ever done something you told yourself you wouldn't do?
of course, hasn't everyone?

Do you eat candy daily?
no no no.

Do you know anyone with a really weird name?
I'm sure I do. Amanda-T is pretty great.

Do you fight with your parents all the time?
I bicker with John, but I wouldn't say we fight. &nbsp;And me and Patti get along really well.

Is your tongue pierced?
no way jose, I like food too much to risk my sense of taste.

Are you in pain right now?
only because I'm not sleeping.

Are you tired right now?
NO. that's my problem.




Have you ever met someone who is amazing?
I've met a lot of amazing people!

Do you pick your words carefully, or just tend to blurt everything out?
I get excited easily, and the more excited I am the less I think about what I'm saying. &nbsp;I always over-think what I'm saying when I'm typing though.

Do you get annoyed by one word conversations?
&quot;one word texts = awful.&quot; &nbsp;YES! It's like-- don't even text me at that point. haha

Do you think a lot of people think bad things about you?
I hope not, but I guess you never know!

Think back to June. Were you in a relationship?
mmm as close as I get to relationships, yes.

Was your last kiss, standing up, sitting down, or laying down?
standing 

Do you care too much or not at all?
wayyyyy too much. &nbsp;it's the root of 90% of all my problems.

Is there someone who meant a lot to you at one point, and isn't around now?
absolutely, yes.

Do you feel like anyone is playing mind games with you right now?
not intentionally. &nbsp;I create my own mind games out of people's compulsory actions. haha- back to me caring too much?

Is someone over protective of you?
my father.

Do you trust people too easily?
no, I don't trust people at all. &nbsp;I just give people too many chances.

Who was the last person you got angry at?
Matt

Have you ever felt like you had been replaced?
all the time

Ever really cried your heart out?

Have you laughed until you cried?
:-) all the time.

What are you doing right now?
sitting in the dark at my desk filling out this survey and trying to find any channel that isn'ttttt airing an infomercial. &nbsp;hahaha I hate my life.

"event","So burn my bra and tattoo rosie the riveter on my arm- today i'm a feminist. 
 
I just found this article written by Eve Ensler (Vagina Monologues) and I thought it was poignant and insightful and I wanted to share it..
so go VOTE.



I am having Sarah Palin nightmares. I dreamt last night that she was a member of a club where they rode snowmobiles and wore the claws of drowned and starved polar bears around their necks. I have a particular thing for Polar Bears. Maybe it's their snowy whiteness or their bigness or the fact that they live in the arctic or that I have never seen one in person or touched one. Maybe it is the fact that they live so comfortably on ice. Whatever it is, I need the polar bears.

I don't like raging at women. I am a Feminist and have spent my life trying to build community, help empower women and stop violence against them. It is hard to write about Sarah Palin. This is why the Sarah Palin choice was all the more insidious and cynical. The people who made this choice count on the goodness and solidarity of Feminists.

But everything Sarah Palin believes in and practices is antithetical to Feminism which for me is part of one story -- connected to saving the earth, ending racism, empowering women, giving young girls options, opening our minds, deepening tolerance, and ending violence and war.

I believe that the McCain/Palin ticket is one of the most dangerous choices of my lifetime, and should this country chose those candidates the fall-out may be so great, the destruction so vast in so many areas that America may never recover. But what is equally disturbing is the impact that duo would have on the rest of the world. Unfortunately, this is not a joke. In my lifetime I have seen the clownish, the inept, the bizarre be elected to the presidency with regularity.

Sarah Palin does not believe in evolution. I take this as a metaphor. In her world and the world of Fundamentalists nothing changes or gets better or evolves. She does not believe in global warming. The melting of the arctic, the storms that are destroying our cities, the pollution and rise of cancers, are all part of God's plan. She is fighting to take the polar bears off the endangered species list. The earth, in Palin's view, is here to be taken and plundered. The wolves and the bears are here to be shot and plundered. The oil is here to be taken and plundered. Iraq is here to be taken and plundered. As she said herself of the Iraqi war, ""It was a task from God.""

Sarah Palin does not believe in abortion. She does not believe women who are raped and incested and ripped open against their will should have a right to determine whether they have their rapist's baby or not.

She obviously does not believe in sex education or birth control. I imagine her daughter was practicing abstinence and we know how many babies that makes.

Sarah Palin does not much believe in thinking. From what I gather she has tried to ban books from the library, has a tendency to dispense with people who think independently. She cannot tolerate an environment of ambiguity and difference. This is a woman who could and might very well be the next president of the United States. She would govern one of the most diverse populations on the earth.

Sarah believes in guns. She has her own custom Austrian hunting rifle. She has been known to kill 40 caribou at a clip. She has shot hundreds of wolves from the air.

Sarah believes in God. That is of course her right, her private right. But when God and Guns come together in the public sector, when war is declared in God's name, when the rights of women are denied in his name, that is the end of separation of church and state and the undoing of everything America has ever tried to be.

I write to my sisters. I write because I believe we hold this election in our hands. This vote is a vote that will determine the future not just of the U.S., but of the planet. It will determine whether we create policies to save the earth or make it forever uninhabitable for humans. It will determine whether we move towards dialogue and diplomacy in the world or whether we escalate violence through invasion, undermining and attack. It will determine whether we go for oil, strip mining, coal burning or invest our money in alternatives that will free us from dependency and destruction. It will determine if money gets spent on education and healthcare or whether we build more and more methods of killing. It will determine whether America is a free open tolerant society or a closed place of fear, fundamentalism and aggression.

If the Polar Bears don't move you to go and do everything in your power to get Obama elected then consider the chant that filled the hall after Palin spoke at the RNC, ""Drill Drill Drill."" I think of teeth when I think of drills. I think of rape. I think of destruction. I think of domination. I think of military exercises that force mindless repetition, emptying the brain of analysis, doubt, ambiguity or dissent. I think of pain.

Do we want a future of drilling? More holes in the ozone, in the floor of the sea, more holes in our thinking, in the trust between nations and peoples, more holes in the fabric of this precious thing we call life?

"event","this past weekend was great. it was london.

i sat for hours and hours in hyde park where J.M. Barrie wrote Peter Pan and I felt it and it was magic.

it reminded me of home in london. or at least it felt simillar. It made me happy I chose Rome. As much as I loved it in england I wasn't outside my comfort zone. Coming here really threw me for a loop. In the best of ways. But I would love to go back to London later. And live there. 


As far as school goes I am failing. not failing in the literal sense. yet. but i don't do my work. and i don't care. i wish that our school was like every other study abroad school and just didn't care. 


in other news i think that i am going to get a tattoo in the next week.  i have to go down to the parlor and explain myself and make an appt but hopefully I can get one before halloween.  and i found the place I want to get my next one in (the one after this).  I think I'll get that one for my 21st. oh bother."

"event","soooo.

I am going to munich tomorrow night at 9pm.

To go to oktoberfest.
I booked it a few hours ago.



And I have 0 accomodations booked.
Because it is Oktoberfest's craziest weekend.
and there is pretty much nothing available.



I figure I will just stay out and party/wander the streets all night long until the sun comes up. 
And then just find a cozy patch of grass in a park and sleep until the mid afternoon.




I like not having plans.  It will likely end in me getting mugged/arrested/defiled.  But I like to think it's bold and adventurous. so it's all good.





I'm just so excited to go to germany and finally be the one who can speak some of the language. eff romance languages."

"event","I haven't updated this journal since july.

I started a new livejournal around the same time and have been using that instead.
A few people know it exists but not many.
I've kind of liked having a more private place where I can say just about anything that enters into my mind without concern of what people will think or who will read it.


but i feel as if I've disconnected myself from some of my oldest friends who read this journal in the process.  I had planned on maintaining this journal as well but things often do, it fell by the wayside.


So I guess if you're reading this tell me something.  You don't have to. But i'd love to hear from you.  leave a sentence or a story or a cheesy emoticon.  anything to say hello.  and i'll try my best to write in her a bit more."

"event","It's weird growing up. someone from my graduating class came in to last stop today. he's married and expecting his second kid. it's hard not to feel like a child most days of the week, but things like that really wake you up.  It's weird because at my new job I'm one of the younger employees and feel more like a kid, but at last stop I'm one of the oldest people there (because mostt people leave) and I always feel so grown up.  But then again I think talking to 16 year olds makes anyone over the age of 16 feel like a grown up.

I feel like in college you grow so much more mature with each passing year. looking at most of the people who just finished their freshman year I'm amazed at how immature they seem in some aspects. but I'm sure I acted exactly the same way this time last year. and i'm sure next year i'll look at them and think the same thing even though I'm typing this now.



I'm very excited for next weekend. I have a feeling fiesta is going to be a bit of a bust since I'm not really friends with that many people anymore. college really does split people up. I'm amazed when I realize how long I've gone without seeing some people. Over a year.  But I have thurs-sat night off and friday day off so I'll be able to go out and enjoy myself no matter what.


meanwhile I bought my ticket to rome. I can't even mention how expensive it was. it still makes me cringe. Butttt it's feeling more and more real with each day. I'm excited. beyond excited. and ready to gooo. I feel too often like I'm standing still, it will be nice to be heading somewhere for a change.








i love when I read so much in such a short span of time after not reading for a while.  I walk around and narrate my life inside my head as if it were print on a page.  ""Jeremiah thought to himself how peculiar her question was.  What were her motives?  He always thought too much when interacting with others.  He chose to ignore her subtle sarcasm and answered her as straightforward as he knew how.."""

"event","ranting on my livejournal makes me feel like a fourteen year old again when I read my entries over the next day. amusing.

tonight was fun. my 12hr day was in reality a 15 hour day. did some set up, some waiting, some bartending, some ushering, some clearing, some cocktailing, watched some lively costumed members sing and dance on stage and was adored by 1000 screaming drunk people. good night.

:LKJfl;sakjd;flkjs;lkdjf;laksjdf it just started pouring as I was typing. best thing ever. oh man. this rain is going to maaake. myyyy. nightttt. I wonder if it keeps raining tomorrow what they're going to have me do. Since I'm supposed to be working an outdoor refreshment bar for tennis players. hmm. wow this rain is amazing. I want to go play in it.





I wish I got tips/more money at the club because then I'd probably go back there next summer, but right now I think I'm going to try to get a job at a chain restaurant and make mad money with 20-30 less hours a week than what I'm doing right now.  Which sucks because I actually kind of like my job. despite all the bitch work it entails.  And my boss pretty much made a shrine of me in his office I think. lovessss my life. I love knowing I'm good at my job. it's such a good feeling. all the restaurants that turned me down last year should RUE the day. rue the day they turned me down. biggest mistake of your livesss."

"event","it seems this summer more than ever I am surrounded by people who are outrageously in love with themselves. i think that is the biggest flaw a person can have. I'm not exactly a modest person, I love praise and appreciation as much as the next person but I'm not arrogant and I don't brag.  Really? is there a need to name all the sick parties you go to, tell me how much everyone loves you, tell me about your awesome new apartment or all the cool people you hang out with? no. I can't stand people who love themselves more than anyone else ever could. I have quite a few at both of my jobs now and elsewhere. and it makes me violent.

On a completely unrelated note: I need to get the hell out of my house. I'm here for approx 1-2 hours per day and it's too much. My dad just went on his 69th rant about me being a vegetarian. This has been going on for a year now. He tried to tell me fish weren't animals. in all seriousness. like thinks fish aren't animals. good thing he's so intelligent. Then told me his whole family makes fun of me for it. SERIOUSLY? fuck you. fuck the mccarthy side of the family. their holier-than-thou bullshit is getting seriously tired.  I'm doing what I want, what makes me happy and comfortable so leave me the hell alone. I didn't ask for your opinion so stop offering it.  I can't wait until they all actually see my tattoo and start talking shit about that. A tattoo on your wrist!? oh my goddd. Jim and mary will have a field day. and I'm just going to fire right back. I'm through being pleasant over there.  I'm sorry I'm not majoring in business or history or planning on going to law school.  I know they mean well but they're so high up on their irish catholic pedestals that they feel they can just judge everyone and everything below it.






I need my friends in my life more.  There are so many things I don't miss about being at college right now, but I reaaally miss living on my own. even if my roommate was atrocious, my room was like a sanctuary and a home at school.  Here it's like a confine. I hate being in my house. And I don't see my friends nearly enough.  They are what makes gloucester so great and without them it feels more and more like a weight holding me down than anything else.

I just can't wait to fucking fly to rome and leave all this bullshit behind for 4 months. Running away to another country sounds fantastic right now.





buttt I guess I should go read some and head to bed since I'm doing 12 hours straight at the club tomorrow with no break. and the same thing on sunday.  Tomorrow should be interesting however.  It's the ""essex follies"" aka all the old members doing a cabaret show singing show tunes.  I've overheard some of the rehearsals while working and let me tell you, this is going to be what I like to call.. A HIT!  I better see some jazz hands or I'm not giving them a standing O. no way no how."

I'm baking my own birthday cake right now. when my birthday was in april..
I don't really know what I expected but I feel a little disappointed that no one ever celebrated my birthday.  I know my family is busy and my mom is outrageously stressed and stuff, but still it's nice to be acknowledged.  I guess I just feel like (not lately because I'm never home and always working) I do a lot for my mom to try and help her cope with everything and with taking care of her mother and while I know she really appreciates it, I feel like baking a birthday cake wouldn't exactly be the hardest way to show she cares.  I'm not nearly as materialistic as I once was so it doesn't bother me at all that I didn't get a present from my parents, but really, I have to bake my own cake?  She bought cake mix a month ago and never baked it. I even bought frosting a couple days ago and said ""I want you to bake my birthday cake."" and days later here I am baking it. I know it's a really small thing, but it just bothers me. 


I think I've pretty much decided that this is going to be my last summer at home.  I see now that I can make a ton of money waiting tables, and I think next summer I'm either going to live at school for the summer and work in easton, maybe taking a couple summer courses, or I'm gonna get a cheap summer rental in gloucester with a friend or two.  I want to take my phone bill away from my parents, and make sure to pay my own car insurance when I get a car this winter.  I need to be more independant.  I don't think my parents will love the idea, but I hope they'll respect it.  I priced some apartments just to get an idea, and it's absolutely a do-able idea if I get a friend or two to go in on it with me. soo yep.

"event","my boss has turned my single on sunday into another double. but I didn't complain because it's time and a half. which means I'm doing five doubles this week. 75 hours. I actually have to run right now to make it to the club for memorial day banquet at five. 

and I also just realized that I haven't had a day off since the 2nd of may, not the tenth, because the two days I had off then were to go back to school, pack and take a final. so as of yet I've been going nonstop for 24 days. I asked nick to pick up either my monday, or tuesday shift next week. or both.  Fingers crosseddd he does that because if not then I'm working until the 9th or the 16th schedule depending. 

I did officially take mondays off of last stop however, so that should work out well.  I'm not sure when it will kick in though. summer schedule starts on the 9th but the highschool kids aren't out until the 12th, so the girl who took the monday shift might not be able to work it. most likely won't. maybe I can get nick to take that one too so I don't have to wait until the 16th for a day off. right now there is a spot in my back that is actually numb. feels like I got jabbed with a needle of novacain.


Ohhh and I sliced off a chunk of my right hand pointer finger with a deli slicer. ...just another thing work has taken away from me. I hope it grows back alright and doesn't screw up my hand at all. fingers (chunkless and otherwise) crossed it's fine.

"event","work owns my life. 

I think I'm going to have to ask to no longer work mondays at last stop.  I worked 75 hours last week, 67 this week once it's over, and then I'm doing 70 next week.  My next forseeable day off is June 8th. And that is highly unlikely to end up remaining a off day.  And I had colleen's graduation last weekend which involved getting up at 6am both saturday and sunday and lots of effort and work and packing and sitting and walking. so I will have essentially had no day off in 30 days by the time june 8th hits.  It's sad that I've begun to view days where I work 8 hours and am out by 3 as a day off.

But yeah, unless it's a holiday my second job (essex county club) doesn't serve on mondays. so if I take it off from Last Stop then I'll pretty much have that one day per week off. I think that might be what I have to do. hopefully nick is still looking for hours at last stop and it won't be too much of a hassle to get that moved. I'll probably start it on june 9th. I just hope it's not one of the days josie is working, because we work the best out of anyone together and those days I actually enjoy being at last stop.



Anyway, I'm not sure yet but I think that's the plan.  I'm working 4 doubles next week. I usually do 3/week but hey if they want to pay me time and a half on monday I'm not gonna turn it down.



anyyyyyway, I should really get some sleep so I don't die tomorrow. and tomorow morning ends my 13 days of waking up at 6am.  Saturday morning sleeping in is going to be such a treat. too bad I have a huge function that night. got to love opening dinners.

I've got a thing for neon and cheap plastic.

They're amazing. I'm legit proud of them. And I pass them out to anyone I slightly know at school. strangers who smile get one too. it's greatt.
And I'm listening to it now and loving my life.

At school we are all just over ""it.""  Over the small school parties, over the need to binge drink every friday and saturday and almost just over each other. haha. We all love each other, but after another year of living with each other we're all on edge and we're ready for summer/study abroad.  But friday night after all complaining about life we actually had an amazing night. almost as if finally voicing our frustrations we were just able to move on and just have fun. haha. anyway it was a Topppppppp nightttt.




Saturday I went home.. after travelling for five and half hours (three of which were spent reading rolling stone, watching daria and chugging vitamin water in north station).  worst experience ever. and so not worth it to come home. should have just stayed at school. but I wanted to visit T and get some stuff done.



the one good thing about going home is that I secured some job-like things.  I need to make bankkk this summer, so I headed to last stop and talked to my boss to pretty much establish my hours of 7-3 mon-fri this summer. 40 hours a week at 11ish dollars an hour. And the fact that I'll be getting home around 10:00 on the night of the first? and will start work at 7am on the 2nd. haha.

Then I applied at alchemy, brackett's and flav's in rockport for a night/weekend job and said I wanted 25-35 hours a week. fingers crossed one of them calls me. slash if you have restaurant connections, help a brother out.

I loved him mostly because of what he said about drinking from the water bucket at night, with the sky reflected in the water, and the gourd filled with stars. When I was sixteen, that was really enough. It did not matter to me that he was crazy and destructive; it may have even made me like him more. Any flaws in his personality were forgotten when he said: 'How often have I lain beneath rain on a strange roof, thinking of home.' I loved that. Honestly, I still do. It still makes me want to write Darl's words on a notebook folder as a symbol of my devotion. So, so, so beautiful."""

"event","I've come to the conclusion that I'm discontent. with life. I'm not depressed or upset, I'm just.. bored.  This year has been fun but lately - for the past few months - it's just been so much of the same. whether it's at school or at home, life is grey. I'm in that sophomore year slump that most people fall into when they grow disillusioned with their school.  I've seen it happen to just about everyone I know and knew it was only a matter of time.  Freshman year when everyone applies to school they fall in love with universities and dismiss the idea of student loans or distance or size ect. because they think they've found their true match in the form of private or public college.  Loans don't seem immediate so a lot of us say screw it! I can pay em when I graduate.  And then you have freshman year and you ""fall in love"" with your new home and your new friends.  But by the time you hit sophomore year you realize how monotonous college actually is, and you start asking yourself if it's really worth all the debt you're putting yourself into.  You discover that it wasn't so much your school you fell in love with, so much as it was the idea of freedom, and the ability to make your own decisions for the first time in your life. You're excited to be out of highschool and to be making new friends.
needless to say it wears off. Stonehill is a great school, I like it here, I'm just kind of over the whole college scene.  Every week involves the same exact things with the same people at the same times.  But that's how it is at any school, it just takes us all different amounts of time to realize it.  I really hope italy is able to spice things up for me. a semester away from here will do me good.  

I don't know, I think I'm not used to spending so much time in one place.. Last year I would leave all the time on weekends even if it was just for a night to visit friends at other schools or go home for a night or whatever.  I'm just really bored with my life.  I don't know if summer will be better, but right now I just want change. 





thankfully being an art major has its perks.  I have one final this semester and it's german. Actually the end of the semester will be fun. April 29th is my birthday, then April 30th is my last day of class, the night of which I am going to a Jimmy Eat World/Paramore concert. Then I present my final collection for my clothing art & culture class on May 1st and head home.  I'll be home for a week, drive back up for my german final on the 9th and take home the rest of my stuff, ending the longest semester known to man.  And then it's bye bye stonehill until january."

And in full protest of winter, I'm bringing home most of my winter clothes. I think I'll bring up spring stuff when I come back from easter break.

Anyway life has been crazy lately. My art professor told me she wanted to hire me as her TA when I come back from Rome next year and take me to Paris with her to study art & fashion for 1-3 weeks. And then told me she wanted to set me up with an internship in beverly at an established art publication company. I was like....okay? haha shocked completely.

I registered for my rome classes (after like 69 meetings with different professors) and am taking Fresco Painting, Figure Drawing, An ""Ancient Rome and it's monuments"" art history class that is on site every week, European Mass Media, and Intro to Italian. So exciting. Fresco painting? I love roma already. August 24th? can't come soon enough.


Also, does anyone work out at the Y when in gloucester. I think I did once in 8th grade but haven't since. I've gotten into a real gym kick this semester and go every day. And I don't want to lose steam while I'm home. But I don't have a membership, does anyone know how much it is to work out for a day w/o one? like five bucks or something? and the Y is huge.. where is the cardio & weight rooms? I don't want to look foolish.  Or does anyone else work out at another gym they'd reccomend? I think I'm asking for a membership to the Manchester Athletic Club for my birthday, but I have a feeling it will cost my broke ass a lot more to work out there for a week then the Y.  Anywayyyy send me your thoughts.




Umm I think that's all for now? Oh my hairpiece art work is currently on display in our school's art gallery which is kind of fun, because it's not a student's art gallery, the majority of the work is from travelling exhibits that display here. There are a few other students in the gallery but the majority of the work is pieces relating to clothing from east coast artists.

"event","I hate pretentious people. and anyone who lets their major in college define who they are. It's so annoying.  It's almost as if people feel a need to prove themselves as being better than other people in one field.  I don't care if you're an engineering major. I don't care if you're an art major, or a fashion major, or a psych major, or an environmental science major.  A few intro courses to a subject far from makes you an expert.  I recently declared a double major and added on a major in Fine Art to my Communications major. And so many of the students in the program are so pretentious.  I get it- you're artsy. no need to flaunt it in everything you do.. say.. wear.. ect.  I just enjoy the subject and had already met a lot of the requirements, so it was logical to declare it.  I do alright. I'm nothing special, and I'm not being modest. I'm decent- not excellent, not terrible. And it is for that reason that I don't fit in. Everyone (despite the theater kids who are all nice and not full of themselves) acts as if they're the most talented original person in existence. Like reaaaally? you go to stonehill. it's not an art school, don't get too carried away with yourself. You don't need to submit a portfolio to be accepted, any one can do it.

  But it's not just stonehill, or just art. Why does anyone have to let their major define who they are.  Your personality should come before what you study. Sure sometimes it comes hand in hand, but it gets old. fast. I don't care what you learned in your classes, so stop bringing it up when it's rarely relevant to sound smart. you just come off looking immature and pompous."

She has a unique sound, and you can tell she's a bit green, but she reminds me of a young vanessa carlton or michelle branch when they were starting out.  I've heard word of her for a little while now, and apparently they gave her a small role on One Tree Hill, so if she can break out of the Bethany Joy/Tyler Hilton path to B-list records, then i think she can have a career for herself.  I love One Tree Hill, and I love what they do for new artists and totally appreciate Mark Schwann's taste and expertise in music.  The show has had some serious musical guest stars but the one's who actually have roles tend not to go that far.  Unless you count pete from fall out boy.. but he had fame before he did the show.  Anyway she's fresh and if you can get a hold of some of her tracks, I think it's worth looking into.

I downloaded a free copy of rachel yamagata's album the other day also. You probably remember her- she was the one who had that song ""Cause I wan-wan-wanna be your love, wanna be your love for real.""  It didn't seem to get her that far, but the album itself is pretty good. It falls into that anna-nalick- pretty-melodic voice-lots-of-piano-esque genre.  which I've been in a real mood for lately, so it's working for me.  Invest sometime in ""Reason Why""  it's a very pretty song.  A good addition to a lazy playlist if nothing else.


Also Zox dropped their new album ""Line In The Sand"" today and I've only been able to hear one of the songs on it ""Goodnight"" because it's not on ruckus yet and the itunes store takes about 24 hours to download an album through my house's ethernet (our wireless is down).  it's their third album, and I'm expecting a lot from it. Goodnight is fantastic, so if that's a sign of what to expect then I'll be pleased.

I'll leave you with some of the lyrics from Goodnight to close with

""There is something beautiful dying every day
And for the first time in my life I'm not afraid
'Cause there's nothing in this world that doesn't change

Goodnight to the person I have been
To the place that I am in
Goodnight tomorrow, hello to the sun....""

I just had one of my art courses tonight that focuses on the connection between clothing and culture and my mind was blown. i'm like the only underclassman that was accepted and I am beyond out of my league. I have to design, create and display a 3+ piece ""clothing"" collection. Quotation marks are used because clothing is a very loose description.  Wearable art is more accurate. though even then, certain pieces don't even have to be wearable just clothing-related.  ANYway I have to show it in the Senior Fine Arts Showcase. Which is a big deal. Like in our art gallery space in front of half the college and everyone's parents ect. Not a fashion show really... though models are needed. It's complicated. The class meets for 3 hours at a time but it's going to require tons of independent studio time which is intimidating, the class is like all friends plus me.  And I'm also in another design course, but for theatrical costuming which requires me to design costumes for two scripts, one of which I have to actually create.  My work load is beyond hectic this semester, but I guess that comes with taking 300 level art courses.  My creativity is going to be uber zapped.  But on the plus side I only have to sit for one final? And it's german.

I'm beyond scared. big big things.

In new news, I finally got a new ipod. ..but it's a nano. And I hateeee how small it is. I miss my old 60 gig ipod photo. It was so hefty and weighty, I loved it. I hate having an ipod the size of a credit card, I miss the weight and importance of those extra 52 gigs.  And 8 gigs (2,000 songs) is far too small.   Those people who say ""and I would never need more than a thousand songs anyway!"" are insane. I had to cut like 3/4 of my library.  But I guess beggars can't be choosers, as I got it for christmas.  And I would never expect my mom to spend the money on a classic. Plus I hate that the new ipods are silver anyway. Where did white go? I think this summer when I have money again I might go on ebay and find an unused older white ipod.  And I can keep this one in my car and take it to the gym or something.

I also got a new laptop. but it's just a replacement kind of. The guy who fixed my hinge the last time had warranteed the repair and when it broke again a month later he realized my computer was a faulty model. So he rebated me the 300 for the hinge repair and gave me 300 trade in for my old comp, and sold me a new custom built laptop for 269 bucks. Couldn't beat it for the money as I'm broker than broke right now. But I think when I take out loans for europe in the fall, I'm gonna figure a new macbook into that. I'm gonna need one as an art major anyway. 

And to top of the new items list, I just got new glasses, and they're great. They actually fit my head and don't fall off. so A+ for that.   If I can scrape together 80 bucks to repair my digital camera maybe I'll throw up a picture soon. Not likely. But god I miss having a camera.



Also, when I was cleaning my room the other week I stumbled upon an album from last summer and have been listening to it ever since. I never really got into it when I first bought it but it seems to be clicking with me right now. You might have heard some of it, but do yourself a favor and get the whole thing. The Truth by La Rocca. If you haven't listened to it, just do it. buy it. or d/l it, whatever floats your boat.


I think I'm gonna go to Mystery Train tomorrow. I hope they've gotten some new stuff in. Last time I was there the selection was shit.  And I want some new vinyl.

Fantastic. Seriously listen to it when you're by yourself and get a chance. I've been listening to it on repeat for a couple days now. And it's just right.


Also I've been listening to Butterfly Boucher a ton again lately. I don't know about you but with me at least, when I find new music I get so so into it. It's all I can listen to for weeks at a time, until I know the chords, lyrics, beats ect. of every song and have taken each line and note to heart. I listen to music until it starts to become boring and old. And I don't know if there's anything better, then months down the road, listening to that music again and falling back into a cushion of comfort and nostalgia.  Remembering how much each song moved you and made you feel. It gives you a feeling so.. safe. It's like coming home after being away for a long time. Remembering that at one time in your life something was so important to you. Songs are tied to memories and rediscovering music can often help you to reflect back on times with a new perspective and understanding.

18. was your last kiss in the rain?
nope

19. Would you rather sleep next to someone else or alone?
alone

21. How did you wake up this morning?
haha a clock that read 12:15 pm.


22. Which is more romantic: sunrise or sunset?
it all depends on what occured before.

23. Favorite verse from a song?
At the moment...
""So I'll hit the pavement 
it's gotta be better than waiting 
& pushing you far away 
cause I'm scared. 
So I'll take my chances 
& head on my way up there. 
Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten ""

24. Would you die for anyone?
I'd like to say yes. for the right person. but I could never know.

25. What's the last bone you broke?
toe.

26. How many letters are in your last name?
8.

27. Do you love anyone besides family?
not romantically. But I love friends as if they were family.

28. What book are you reading?
none at the moment. unless you count textbooks. ughh.

29. How was your day?
lazy. and shitty. except for watching peter pan which made my day.

30.do u live near ur friend
At home and at school.

31. Are you scared of spiders?

34. What do you think of Fergie?
she can't help it, the girl can't help itttt.

35. Do you believe in love?
I'd like to. For other people perhaps. I don't like that people view it as the purpose of life.  The point of life is to live not to love. If it happens then great, but I don't think it's the center of everything.  As someone who has never romantically loved anyone I guess I can't speak from both sides. But I can say with supreme confidence that you can lead a beautiful and wonderful life without it. 

36. How old do you want to be when you have kids?
I don't think I want to have kids. But if I did then probably in my thirties. I don't want to resent children for cutting my youth short.

37. When was the last time you were so drunk you threw up?
September. But I was drinking on an empty stomach and had taken pills before hand so really it was my fault.

38. Do you curse a lot?
I'd like to curse less. But I wouldn't say I'm crude. I have a verbal filter.

39. What do you know about the future?
nothing concrete. I have ideas but I'm not making anything definite. I know that I want to be happy, and I want to explore.

41. Do you only drink bottled water?
Not only, but I prefer it over tap.

42. Are you happier single or with a boyfriend/girlfriend?
Single. I hate having to depend on someone other than myself.

43. Do you believe everyone deserves a second chance?
Yes. People change and they grow. Everyone deserves a second chance. The trouble is finding it in yourself to give it to them.

45. Most hated food?
mustard.

47. Do you wish someone would call you?

Or maybe just trying to follow in sarah brightman's footsteps.. good luck. But when you play it really loudly by yourself it has a much better effect and I like it. Whoever artistically directed the music video though.... really? Having her swimming in a pool wearing a big dress? How original. Really sir, you think OUTSIDE the box. I mean, I have nevvver seen that done before. And the way you make her look like a struggling cat forced into a bathtub? brilliant. It's almost like she's trying really hard to be graceful and failing miserably. but i'm sure that's what you were going for.

"event","So remember last week when I was talking about how I wish I had a bigger audience for my blog?

Well kids, be careful what you wish for. The Catholic Church is keeping tabs on yours truly. Apparently I'm such an intruiging subject that my computer is bugged, and this journal entry you are reading right now has probably already been scanned for offensive material, antichrist rally info, and curse words.


Today as I was finishing up my Mediated Comm test (total breeze), I got a voicemail from my Education Professor. Professor Anderson or Katherine as we will refer to her for her own safety, is in charge of the group that I go into Brockton with every week to teach the children of ""Code Name: Catholic Spy School."" I adore Katherine and this breech of my blog in no way pertains to her. She merely served as the messenger of THE MAN (aka god?). She seemed kind of odd in her message and said she needed to talk to me really quickly if I could stop by or give her a call. I was right near the eduaction building anyhow, so I just walked right over.

..here's where it get's weird..

Not more than ten or twenty seconds after I settled myself in her office did she look at me and say in a confused tone, ""So are you umm.. Jeremushpick??""  After a baffled moment of silence I nodded and managed to spit out ""uhh yes. my blog.""  She continued on to tell me that my most recent entry had been read over and was deemed unacceptable. She had just gotten a call from the principle of Code Name: Catholic Spy School, who had recieved an anonymous piece of paper on her desk: a print out of my livejournal entry naming the name of the school, and number of first names of students.  She thought at first I myself had submitted my blog entry for review (apparently very confused and not all that with it).  She didn't know where it came from but found issue in me mentioning the school and in mentioning the children by name.  Katherine said she kept waiting to hear what the problem was, expecting perhaps to hear the principle say ""And then jeremushpick wrote that when the teacher wasn't looking he assaulted the children with heavy text books and told them god was fake.""  Katherine asked the principle what it was she wanted her to do, and the principle responded that I should alter my older post and refrain from mentioning anything by name, school or children alike.


What I find most interesting is how someone mananged to find my blog, and who it was that submitted it to the principle without her knowledge. I mean honestly. My archaic blog that I've had since I was 12, that NO one at college knows about, that is not linked to any other of my sites (facebook ect.), that is unsearchable by content, somehow manages to surface five days after a post is made, and is mysteriously placed in the hand of an elementary school principle in Brockton.



Which is why I have come to the conclusion that I am under investigation by the Catholic Church, and probably the FBI too. My entries from now on will have to be encrypted.  I would make them friends only, but it's not like I say important things or say things I care about other people reading anyway, and I like having a public blog. But I may disguise your names for your own safety. God knows who's reading. And I mean that literally. Because they are his workers."

In other news... It's raining :D

I love nothing more than the smell and sound of rain. it quiets things and calms me and I honestly feel elated on rainy days. 

I also went to TJ Maxx the other day to pick some nicer clothes for my Learning Community Job (I'm going into Brockton for a few hours every thursday to Trinity Catholic elementary school to teach 2nd graders about environmental science and the environment) and I shopped just about the whole time in the kids section. TJ Maxx = already cheap clothes. TJ Maxx little boys section = super cheap clothes. holler at my lighter but more content bank account.

I am seriously broke though. not good things.


In other news, being back at school is an adjustment and I'm not like 'loving life' every second of every day, but I've finally accepted it as home and that makes me happy. I'm really enjoying myself, and I'm happy with my friends and some of my classes and life is good. I wish Ian didn't transfer so i wasn't stuck with my third stranger of a roommate, but the house is nice, and I love having my own bathroom, and that's what I get for wanting to transfer every second.

I met with my advisor and I think I'm gonna try and go abroad all of junior year. I want to do fall semester in some place really exciting like beijing or morocco or egypt, and then do spring semseter doing an internship for a high end Australian magazine. It will be tight, but most kids at stonehill that get internships have night jobs so I'm hoping I can make it work. And if I do the beijing placement, it's suuuuuuper cheap and they even give you a like 3 week tour of China included in tuition. incredible. So who knows it's ways away but we'll see. 



anyyyyway I'm going over to Brittany's room and we're ordering food in, so I'm out for now.

I don't like staying in the same place for too long, doing the same things, thinking the same thoughts. I need new adventure and challenge and now chocolate after thinking about that movie.

Ugh sometimes I wish I weren't so messy at life. Who knows maybe stonehill will surprise me and living in a townhouse and working with city public schools in brockton will shake things up. Or maybe if I finally manage to supress the urge to flee it will be tamed. Here's hoping."

I love when it rains. I wish I wasn't working and was able to really enjoy it. But todays my last day in the office which is nice. I think I'm going to call the emerson inn in rockport and see if they still need front desk help this month. they were looking around for august help and I wound up with the guys business card. We'll see. probably not. 

Working in boston has made me realize how much I miss the city. I wish I had been a little bit braver and a little bit more patient last fall. I always thought of myself as being brave and open to new experiences, and my faith in that faltered after new york. maybe I was just too young and too attatched to my friends and my home. I think I could make it in new york in a second now. I have so many less ties to gloucester this summer than I did last summer, it's amazing. When I lived in new york, I thought of gloucester and all of the people who lived there as being my safety net and my source of comfort. Returning here this summer I finally have that drive that I lacked last summer to break out, break away, ground myself and establish roots elsewhere. I have all of one or two great friends where as last summer I thought I had twelve.  I think it was a nelson mandella quote that said something along the lines of ""There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered."" I really see myself in the quote today. I'm still not sure if I've changed for the better, but my skin's a bit thicker, and I'm a bit wiser for the wear. I'm a different person than I was last year. I feel like everyday, gloucester becomes less and less my home. It's a sad thought, but a true one. 

I'm not sure why, but I have this uncanny ability to realize exactly what it is I need, the second it's already passed me by."

"event","So to add to my ""People I don't ever want to resemble when I'm older"" list, (which includes items such as commuter, accountant, pencil pusher ect.) I am going to make an amendment to the ""accountant"" title and add ""anyone who feels a need to call their accountant on a daily to bi-daily basis.""

who knew even accounting firms had regulars?

In other news, I haven't slept more than five hours at a time in the last week. I am very rundown, I'm not used to being sleep deprived at all. My eyes are swollen and puffy and I am not exagerating when i say that the bag under my left eye is so dark and puffy that it looks as if I have a small black eye. I kind of like it. I think it give me some street cred. All the other NineToFivers in the elevators give me my space, they're probably scared I'll challenge them to a showdown at the water cooler or something equally as frightening.

Now comes our favorite section of the update,
My rant for the day:

Does anyone else find it funny and a bit unnecessary that people even dress up to come to an office anymore? You can completely see the way in which casual dress has wormed it's way into the heart of office wear and I just find it incredibly comical. The universal dress code for men working in an office setting today seems to require them to wear frumpy ill-fitting dockers adorned with a wear worn leather braided belt, accompanied only by faded and often dingy polo that is slowly nudged out from it's hastened tuck job thoughout the day by the man's bulging beer gut. The men tend to top off this chic ensemble with poorly combed hair and a fresh pair of new balance or nike sneakers (which look absurdly white against the dull beige pants and shirts that seem to match the personality of their owners). It doesn't look classy or professional at all. I get that wearing a suit to work might be a bit overkill for a lot of offices, but I see no difference in wearing wrinkled dockers and a ratty polo than in wearing jeans and a t-shirt. And at least then everyone would actually be comfortable. And while the women try a bit more than the men, it seems as if the financial district was cut off from any new fashions post 1987. yes yes, indeed. The floral frock dominates the streets here and it's variations range anywhere from the shapeless oddly lengthed skirt to the full on mumu.  Yet it seems that the offices turn a blind eye to this informal formality, as this form of dress still seems to pass as business appropriate. I understand all of the comfort and practicality issues that commuters and city workers face, and I sympathize, but I just see no reason why--if casual comfort seems to be the top priority--we even keep up the charade of ""work attire.""  It's an outdated concept and unless carried out in the correct fashion (excuse the pun) ceases to retain any real purpose. 
The endddddd.





All I want right now, is to go home, curl up in my room and watch daria for hours on end. Embrace the inner cynicism and hate the world all on my own.

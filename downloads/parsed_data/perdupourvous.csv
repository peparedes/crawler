"event","Yesterday was not bad. Went to school until lunch, left with Corey and Ariel. We drove around, and Corey got cigarettes and then he dropped Ariel and myself off at McyD's while he went home and negotiated with his G-ma to let him out.

We got kicked out cause we weren't buying shit and went outside to the pay phone that Corey was gonna call us from, it rang as soon as we got there...kinda cool. 

Talked to Corey, said he would be 5 minutes. Well, he wasn't...we walked to 711 and saw Bryan Redman and the twins that were in my german class, Joe and ...::insert others name here::. It was kinda sad that i got in their car, told them not to tell me which was which, starred at them in the face and STILL guessed wrong. :X

We went into 711 with our whole .10$ (ten cents) and got a tootsie roll each. To my surprise, Ariel stole 2, aw.

We went to some office building and waited in there for Corey, he came...we went to Staple to steal a ruler. Parked in a handicapped space and some handicapped man came by the car and gave us the meanest look, so while Corey was in staples...I reparked...mwahahha.

Went home after that...called up Laura. Dave came and got me as soon as i got home. Me and Him went to get Kenzie in Clarksville...brought her back to Lauras with Pru, waited for Lauras mom...headed over to Justins.

At Justins we did bong rips of some of the nicest pot I have smoked in a long time. AHHH! I was so high. :D

Laura didn't feel well, and Dave had to go to class at 7, and so we took Kenz and Pru home, then Laura, and then myself. 

I passed out around 8:30, and didn't call Ryan, whom I was so excited about talking to all day, blah.

Today is Friday, I already promised the ""early evening"" to Josh (victory twin josh) because I sorta didnt get to chill yesterday. But other than that...Im totally free, and I know of some parties and I know of other things...

WAIT ...I might be going on a small little road trip with Matt and Dave to Pennsylvania....tonight to get some AK47. ;D 

I love road trips, I love car rides. So, I don't know...we'll see....Just leave a comment if you are interested in chillin at some point this weekend...and some ideas of what to do. <3<3"

Ryan and his friend Dan picked me up :D. We drove to Ryans and then to Dan's house to have a barbeque.

Well...it was cold outside and it was just us 3, so we George Forman'd that shit. ( I didnt eat, cause I'm not big on meat )

We sat around and drank beers, they ate and watched the Sopranoes. (sp? I don't watch this show...)

Around 3:30, Dan took us back to Ryans house and I met Ryans brother and Dad for the first time. They are nice, his brother told me that I sing well, (though I don't) he only heard me because RYAN puts me on speaker phone :P 

Hungout there until around 7, cleaned off his car, got gas...came home. Sat.

Went to bed at 10. But, this whole 5 day weekend was bomb, I had a good time the whole time."

Spent most of the day inside, showered...slept...walked around...called laura. Made Plans.

We decided to hangout with Ryan and then we decided to get drunk and play in the snow.

Liquor store run....lots of 40ozs....and 20 minutes later, we found ourselves at my friends Jason and Josh's house. (yes, their OWN house)

Everyone there was drinking...playing monopoly, when Josh beat Steve and chaos struck out. ""I'm RICH BITCH"" (no comment)

We got dressed warm (mostly just goofy) and went outside, snow fights in the front yard, stop for gas, stop at Nat's house to PISS and then to the Giant parking lot to sled at the hill.

THIS WAS SOO MUCH FUN!!!!! ahhh...i rode this little piece of like steal the whole time and busted my ass every like 5 seconds. Woooo. My back hurts but it was fun at the time and yeah...i was tipsy :D

Laura thought it was past 10 and we were 30 minutes from home and had to drop Jason off, so we had to get a move on and yeah...

We watched a boy take a shopping cart up the hill and bust his ass the first 2 feet.

Took Jason home, said goodbye to Josh and Jason and company, got lost like 3 times...pulled <b>6</b> u-balls and Ryan was NOT happy....I found our way home, god bless me.

Took Laura home, Took me home. Said goodnight...bleh bleh bleh. It was a lot of fun, I got home about 10:30 and was still tipsy.

"event","Well, it started off with me and Laura and Neil Russel and Ariel. We all wanted to take a road trip, mostly me. And Neil decided that he could drive. I don't know where we were cause everything in the dream was so much better than real life. We drove in a astro-van type thing and it was Neil and Ariel up front and kiley and Laura in the back. I was talking to them the whole time.

While driving, it seemed like we were at an old fashioned ocean town (make what you want of this description, I'm sure yours is as good as mine) 

We stopped off at this HUGE supermarket to buy food, but we didn't buy anything. I just stole a thing of bananas and left. 

In the parking lot, there was a new car that Laura was sitting in, she says the keys are in there and since we live no where around this area, we should take it for the trip. So I hopped in and started driving. 

Soon enough, the road turned to like...the YELLOW BRICK road, and we were driving down country roads with huge poppies(like the flower) of every color. It was sooo cool. 

We picked up Chris Davis and Noah Herman on the side of the road and continued on, we ended up having to go back to Catonsville to meet up with Neil and Ariel and Sarah Federline at a FED EX there...but when we came back we had to ditch the car and walk, we were walking around like a forest...we never found Neil again....

But this dream was a lot of fun, i just thought I'd tell ya'll about it. ( it was a  lot better than i can remember to tell)"

It snowed. Could still be...I'm not near a window.

Had a lot of conversations with people about life and problems and relationships and personal faults. It made me depressed. But it was something that needed to be done, everyone should evaluate themselves every once in a while. 

In fact, all I have been doing lately is trying out a few things...new and old...to find myself.

Well, I was in Naptown, what what. w00t. 

<lj-cut font=""The story"">Sike, but I was in annapolis with my friend Ryan. It was fun, he came and picked me up around 4 and we drove back out to his hood and went to annapoliss mall. Walked around and got food. Then we walked around MORE and before we left, we got pictures in the photobooth, just like we did 2 years ago when we met at the ocean &hearts;.

We went and sat in his car for awhile, a long while. We sat first in the parking garage, then we drove to Wendys so that Ryan could wet his whistle and sat in the Wendys parking lot for a large portion of time, from like 7-9. The car was sooo hot, we blasted heat and just ""goofed off"", i dont know if anyone ever chilled in a car and just found ways to entertain themselves, that was kinda what happend here.Then, he gave me a massage and I laughed cause muh back is soo ticklish. [/blush]

Uh, wow...it feels weird to recap and give people an actual account of my day. I havent done this in a while.

But then we went to his house and his friend came over, and though he shook my hand and introduced himself, i forgot his name.

Nameless friend ""Im tryna blaze"", Kiley ""you wanna, i got a dime?""

So Ryans friend rolled us a really nice blunt and we smoked,  just the two of us, cause Ryan can't smoke anymore. But he videotaped the fun, and I hate being on camera, the end.

 I couldnt even finish the blunt, my stomach hurt so bad all day and I felt like i was dying, so I just kinda stopped talking and I listened to them talk about so and so and who ever and just thought it was funny. I also thought about my friends and how weird it could be for other people to chill with them without knowing them and stuff, i dont know...

Around quarter after 12, we left Ryans house to come back to mine. This was probably my favorite part of the night. Ryan has a cool ass bmw and the whole time he kept trying to get cars to race with him. There was a mustang, a gti and some corvette. I dont know, it was just neat, I thought and thats that.

<b>Overall Opinion:</b> I spent the whole day with Ryan and that was cool, different...but not bad. :D///////

<b>*</b>Make better and more longterm friendships, sturdy relationships, etc.

<b>*</b>Stop randomly smoking cigarettes so i dont get addicted

<b>*</b>Stop fighting without thinking

<b>*</b>Get license

<b>*</b>Talk less and quieter [mwhahaha]

<strike>become a different kiley</strike>

<b>*</b> Better Kiley. Kthx.


So anyways, as all of you may have noticed my life is currently involved in nothing but smoking pot. I do it daily, and I make and break plans revolving around when and when i can't smoke. I got <b> another</b> free dime yesterday, [with the one I had already] and smoked two blunts. Plus I still have a dime from buying one the other day and now I am just waiting until later to smoke with Dave Windsor and Matty Pless :D. Yay! 

Going to the show tonight. You know, for the atmosphere and everyone is going to be there, so thats always fun.

It started late, probably not until a little after 5:00pm. Kenzie came over around 4 and we got online to look for things to do. Jason wasn't busy and said that he would like to chill. 

Jason also smokes pot. [well I'll be damned]

Well, the day started going good after a bit of trouble, which was as follows: no money, no banks open to cash check, no liquor stores, and giant doesn't cash checks either, no money still, when we get money we cant find pot...fuckkkkkk!

Well, we call Dougie again and get Nicks home phone number, because there is a complication about me getting my pot, that I don't want to bother and explain because it was solved tonight.

I called Nick. Nick then presented me with a proposition. An exchange of 2 dimes <b>[for free]</b> for a ride to Ray's house and to 7-11 and back to his own house. This, this sounded like a good deal, so we presented Nick with his ride to and from and then in exchange we went off to smoke blunts.

I bought us some blunts. And we rolled two blunts and smoked mad. Right out in some field, it was neat. Could have been very romantic even. <b>*sigh.</b> But in any case, from there we went to taco bell and then to McDonald for me to get a sundae. mmm

Saw some people that i don't like; some that i do.

Drove around some backboards for fun and overall had a good day, <b><i>without Laura.</b></i>

"event","Sooo today was eventful, bought a quarter with laura.

Rolled some blunts...

Smoked some bowls...

Went to a party...

Repeat above...
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Talk about a great muther fucking way to celebrate you're big 18th birthday! (well not me, hehehe...But muh lovely Ms. <b>MELISSA MEHL!</b> happppppiest birthday, beautiful!) 

<lj-cut text= ""So Here's the Story"">Okay, I rolled up earl(ish) with three people i didn't know, and the two i thought were coming with me...uh...

Thinking of nothing better, and having a lot of pot, I asked Melissa to come smoke a birthday blunt with me and matt calka and laura and bryan (vodka man:D). Twas straight, we smoked upstairs and melissa kept going and being a social butterfly, but she was so cute. the end. sikkkke, nigga cheese......

So we sat and finished that blunt, I had already 2 blunts that day, and then went downstairs and drank some beer. I think I had like 3 all night and did some shots with some people randomly telling me to taste their shit. Most of it was good, but I was feeling tipsy and I was already retarded high and didn't want to get drunk cause...yeah. Drunk Kiley = can be a disaster. :X

More people showed up, like Jen King and Steph G. and John Bell and Rich and Chris and others and yeah. Steph was tryna smoke and I still had like a dime and a half left and a roach....soo

I went backupstairs and packed mad bowls with Steph and Matt Calka, and then Travis came upstairs and smoked a couple bowls and the laura came up and was matching bowls too. WOoooOooo Weee.

I was fucking gone, I came downstairs everyone is making out on the couch, hahaha...what the fuck dude?

<b>So get this :</b>
Tim LUPANIC, yes you alllllll know him [ <lj user=young_n_hung> ] tells me mad shit all the time about this and that (which doesnt matter, its besides the point) and i dont even care but this is just a good reason to use as justification to throw that option OUT THE WINDOW. making out with sarah federline and then coming and trying to be all fresh, eww. grow up. BEAT STREET </pow>

<b>And Andrew:</b>
Some of you may know him, but for those of you that dont [ <lj user=youngmansgame> ] was making out with some horrible UGGGGGGGG-oh! (yes, that does mean intensely ugly) girl on the couch too, next to her two friends that were both like...licking on eachother and shit, i was about ready to piss myself laughing. This doesnt bother me either, but i felt like an asshole bringing them, and they all singled themselves out getting drunk on the couch and eww...it was B-o-g-u-s. 


<font size= 7> DID I MENTION I DONT CARE. <font size= 1> their lose.

I feel like being mean...so let me continue:

I also met the infamous Melissa Cooper, i swear...did that girl fall from a stupid tree and hit every branch on the way down? And yeah, I heard she was slutty...but fucking .....Guuuoooewwwwwww. (yes, that IS the noise that adam sandler makes in billy madison when he realizes that his little friend pee'd his pants) YO IS BUSTED. :X. all grabbing on matt and lacking anything respectable...Well, I guess I can respect the fact that she doesnt talk much, cause when she does she just spues [like vomit] out pointless jiubba jabber.

I was really high, but really intensely scoping everyone out, i was doing crazy fucking tearing apart of peoples personalities, but mostly everyone there had a good one.

Let me see, saw chris davis, thought it would be uncomfortable or BAD but it was neither...i guess we had a bit of a hello...but mostly just he poked me, i said something high and walked away laughing. 

Stephi, my lovely...was completely wasted. When i got there she was drunk...when i left, she looked like she was passing out. Aw, it was adorable though, She just kept asking me to get her the phone, and i kept paging it and trying to find that shit...lelelele. 

Im really burnt. :D

So all in all, Melissas party was fucking rock. I meant to go back, but Im a stupid little pothead and I passed the fuck out on the floor, I was dead tired. I think more people should throw parties like LeMissa. :D ty ty ty ty ty ty ty ty ty. <3 [ i mean, you know its going to be good, when you're passing a blunt around with her rents =-O ]</lj-cut>"

"event","With a best friend like Laura, I always have a good time and remain full in the tummy...not just with the butterflys she gives me, SHE GETS ME FOOD. like check this: <b>TWO</b> huge boxes of oatmeal cream pies (*my favorite snack cake, next to butterscotch krimpets) Oh it was soo hot. and Imagine this= i got her slimjims, haha. We are equal.

Anyways, yesterday was fun. Me and Laura and Sarah went with Dustin Fischer to buy pot and a blunt. We went to his friend PJ's house to smoke. Well, I bought two large dimes and we smoked a really large blunt. I was fucking gone. I did not talk the whole time we sat there, thats how i get. <b>QUIET!</b> what the fuck? Kiley should not be quiet, its almost an oxymoron, in fact <b> it is!</b> 

*Sarah= ""Kiley, I've never <b>heard</b> you this quiet before"" < see! hahaha. 

Well...anyways, we chilled there a little, then left. Went to mcdonalds and had mindless fun. And then we were scared out of our minds...

<lj-cut text=""ifyouwanttohearascarystoryaboutaHOMELESSMAN!""> I went into the bathroom to straighten up before going home, really hihg...and i am SOOO thankful i brought sarah with me. Cause...we walked in and there was this dude in there, fucking homeless as shit,  taking a shit with the door fucking open and i was just like ""what the fuck"" but im high, so i thought it was funny and almost started laughing, but i dindt want to stare at his ass taking a shit so i stared into the mirror where i couldnt even see him in my p. vission. (p vission for lack of being able to spell) and then sarah comes and grabs me and is like ""what the fuck that guy was standing up with a knife and your just gonna stand there"" so me and her run to laura, she is flipping me out, and we ran home. the end.</lj-cut>"

"event","Let's see...today went by slow, I just couldn't find anything motivational. But then Justin started talking about making plans, so I got up and got showered/dressed...etc. He called and said that he wouldn't be interested in doing anything until around 9:00 to go see the matrix or something...

This made me suddenly lose all my newly found motivation. I didn't want to go to the movies, or anywhere.

But...I got online...and Dave Whitaker IMed me and said he hadn't gotten out all day and asked if I wanted to go see ELF. well...Ill be damned, I did. So I got shoes and stuff, asked my mother and she said okay.

me and dave got lost going to the movie and then we got there too late and they wouldnt let us buy a ticket...since it was the last show. Bummer. So we went downtown and around and then to his house. [I am trying to make a long story short, cause this isnt what i am getting at...]

<b>So, the fluff of my story and reasoning for my immensely sad mood.</b>

We had a really good time, and Dave is a good friend of mine, and i am thankful for that (wrong holiday, eh?)....at the end of the night...he took me home and we were in his car and he told me that he got me a present for christmas....he pulled out a really nice journal. It was such a nice present because it was completely thoughtful and though it might not seem like it, he knew that i enjoy to write and he got me a beautiful new journal, and its even better that its from someone, cause it makes it that much more special to write in. Well I gave him a hug goodbye and told him to have a happy christmas and thanked him. Things seemed...odd.

I got in the house and opened the journal and on the first page he wrote to me and put in a poem that i wrote and showed to him that he really liked, and i wont tell you what its all about, just because...but it was a really meaningful poem and it was really sweet that he did that, and it made me feel awful because he kinda bolded this one line and it just hit me that i have been retarded and blind to something...and i feel like shit. i would go into more detail, but its not really needed. My justification for feeling bad is ALL HERE and i dont feel that i need to tell you what it is, rather...i will just tell you that i do feel like shit for reasons unsaid...ugh. 

but all in all, the journal is SOOOOO sweet and i am going upstairs to write in it right now, and i am going to make it a diary/sketchbook etc....and when i fill it up, i think ima give it to him to let him read my thoughts and stuff...:D night."

<u>This is where I stand in life:</u> 
* grounded
* no christmas
* JOINS officer (my own personal buddy that makes sure i stay on track)
* Expelled
* School at fucking rosedale or some shit?
________________________________________

As much time as I do have, I have none for other people. I woke up Friday [I believe] and just decided to drop all relationships outside of Laura and good friends. I mean, I feel completely indifferent to them now. I guess its a little shitty...but I have no time to worry or be concerned with shit that only makes stuff harder. I am no longer interested in having a ""love life"". Heh. I'm just interested in getting back on track. But you know...when I really think about it, I'll always have time for a really hot guy...I just have to meet one. :X 

Wow, what the hell is wrong with me? Why am I such an awful person? I really believe that I don't care about stuff enough. Outside of the things that are horribly important to me [very few] I just don't give a shit, and sometimes I'm too blunt about it. I told my mom today that I really don't give a shit about some stupid christmas presents and that I can't wait to get the hell out of her house. I told her that I have no intentions of becoming part of our family and that my only goals are leaving in the near future. 

Apparently that makes me a ""<i>piece of shit.</i>""

I don't know, maybe it does but I just don't seem to care, as much as I search my soul or heart or anything, I can't find a reason to. 

Someone called me cliche today. Or something, said I should change my name to it, cause I'm emo or something ridiculous and dumb. Well, I don't know how I come off emo...I don't ask for sympathy by telling people that all I do is think about how much I hate myself and my life. In fact, I talk about the complete opposite...about getting out and making my life something worth remembering, having as many great experiences as I can before its all said and done, that I am happy and tired of being held down....but uh...to each their own...

<u>As soon as I get off of punishment I have the following planned:</u>
*hang out with the lovely Laura [and gang]
*hang out with all my lovely friends that are home from COLLEGE [Mark:D, Chris Daniel, Andy, Jason, Jeff...etc]
*NEW YEARS EVE PARTAY
*oh oh oh...and of course, hanging out with the lovely David Whitaker.


[I'm still a horrible person....hahahaha...I can't help it.]

P.s- shout out to <b>Steph R.</b> the loveliest and silliest girl I know. [don't  you love my GAY ""shoutout"" hehehehe]"

"event","So let me see...I ""ran away from home"" again...but its not even like that, I just didnt come home for a couple days and my parents reported me missing. So I had to deal with the police and shit and then everything was coool. I dont think I'm in that much trouble. In fact...I am my own restriction. I have been in the worse moods lately and have been reduced to sitting in my basement, eating icecream and watching movies a million times. WHAT A LIFE. chaaaaa ching.

But, lets get something straight. I am grounded a bit...and if I wasn't I still would probably stay in. Last night I sat online for four hours chatting away with Dave Whitaker. Mostly about being bored and then about writing and stuff. He's a good listener...and all I do is talk, so its a very balanced relationship. I wrote this poem while talking to him, cause he wanted me to. And he said that he wished it was about him....it's funny....because it really was, I just didnt have the guts to say so.

I really need a job...soon enough I shall be traveling out into the vast world and retrieving one. Saving up all my money and this summer...hitting the road. I already talked to Dave about going to California with him...or somewhere [west coast bound] and I don't know exactly what will happen from there...I figure, with any job I'll make about $200 every paycheck...every two weeks or week, depending upon how much i work...and over the next 5 months have roughly $4000 saved up. But this is also taking in account that i will probably spend a lot on drugs or worthless shit throughout the time and really have about...$3000...but thats good enough. I can get a job where ever we end up. Or maybe we'll only go for a few weeks. I don't know...I just need more adventure and fuuuuuuunnnnnnnn ...TBC"

<lj-cut text=""my day..."">Today I skipped first period with Laura and John, we went to Ellicot City and we got breakfast. We ran to homeroom so I could act all non-chalant and shit and pretend like I was in school the whole time. 

Made it through the school day with only one thought constantly racing through my head and pushing me to continue ""weed and blunts"" Thats right...2 grams and a dime. mmm....

So after school I went to Johns and we sat around and ate :D I peed (just so you know) and we headed over to Crown Title so I could make money. I didn't feel like working right then, soooo...I asked him to just take me home. Came home and sat around...made fun of my mom for buying the dog a fucking set of jingle bells...FOR A COLLAR! (the poor thing) and then I told them I was going to the library. I walked to meet John and went and DID my work and got a dime from Pat and went to the library, got online...

This is when I invited Tim to come and smoke a blunt with us. He walked and met us and we went to buy one from the shell. Bought one and started making plans to smoke...well on the way we were stopped by someone calling Lauras name. We went and saw that it was Jake and his crew. I helped Laura settle her differences with this girl Diana that wanted to fight her, being the good loud mouth best friend that I am and then Justin rolled us a blunt. It was shitty.

My brother came up all crazy-like and stole me away. THE BASTARD. Laura gave Tim the blunt and we plan on smoking it tomorrow and watching movies :D , soooo good...cause I am a lazy fuck and thats all I need in my life, couches blunts and movies. Sooo plan tomorrow = school, work, blunts. end. </lj-cut>"

Basically...everything is back to normal, if not better then normal. I just realized that I was letting my own insecurities affect how I feel...but, currently I feel content with the fact that I DO have feelings for him. so, all good in this hood. end. </ fixed>"

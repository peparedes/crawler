"event","Ohh god im bored allready, so bored im writing on here.
So heres some shit that I did lately, so everyone knows whats up with me, not that you care.

I quit my job, I hate racist/super religious people, enough that I simply walked out finally.

I passed two classes that I never attended. Im not really sure how either.

I have to take two summer classes, because my prof was supposed to let me take an independant study, however he completly forgot until it was too late and made me have to stay in Lexington an additional three months.  I think he should have to pay the 1,600$ he cost me, fuckin idiot.

I went to subway and when I handed my cash to the guy who made my sandwhich he had a coke spoon, I don't feel sick yet, but im concerned.

Doozer drove to the library just to edit my paper.  Tommorow when I go back to subway, I am going to score some blow from that guy as compensation.  His selflessness surely deserves some powder.

I got told for the third time in my life I would be the coolest man alive in the 80's and none of the people knew each other it was just three random comments in the span of 8 years.  If you could tell me what the hell about me makes people say this id love to know, im not sure if its good ord bad, but it certainly doesn't seem like the best thing to be told.

For about the millionth time I am a baseball hypocrit.  I absolutly hate the way the sport is run, and I hate how slow the game is, its simply not very exciting compared to any other sport.  But when the Reds are doing well, im a junky and look stupid for bashing the game all the time.  That being said im not a bad fan I love them never turn my back on them or anything just they are even harder to take than the Bengals 1991-2003 because they have no damn excuse they are the fuckin Reds.

My last college class is August 3rd, I will be moved in at home in NKY that same day, I will not come back unless you bribe me."

Doozer's top 3 were John Wilkes Booth, the lead singer from Linkin Park (chester) and David Schwimmer, I got John Grisham and Jared Leto.  I think its hillarious that you could get John Wilkes Booth and then the guy from linkin park 1 and 2 thats freakin hillarious."

"event","Over the last 3 years I have lived with the same two guys.  Sometimes I am not sure what it is we have in common but at this point we have transcended any of that crap and they are my brothers, not in a craig, I love my big bro way, but in a nuclear, hodge podge family way.  So I dont give a shit about the things they do that I love to death and the annoying ass things they do I hate, both lists are long but I dont care.  This was a round about way of getting to the point that though some shit they do may be endearing and others annoying i live with two really really unique guys, I dare someone to deny that, we could have a fuckin TV show about us.  Anyways point is they are original for better or worse, and this isnt a love fest, but what makes them so great is there pretty true to themselves and not always trying to be someone else.  So take that to heart, its a real vague thing I know but we all know what I mean."

"event","So it has been like 5 months since I have written on here.  Mike and me talking about it at lunch today,and his comment to me  made me decide to update if for no other reason my last entry was kind of a downer.  And I hate to be like that.  I really have no idea what to talk about, I am currently trying to type this paper at 4:30am that is due tommorow that I had the whole week to do.  All week long I have been going to sleep at like 5pm and waking up at like 1am, its really bizzare, and it has me wondering to some people go through life like this?  I just assume it is a stage that im going through, spured on by the fact that I am no longer taking my sleeping pills, and I have horrible insomnia, as well as a caffiene addiction that often keeps me up.  However I mean lets say I never stop drinking soft drinks, will I always be doing this?  How funny would it be if I do this night MBA class, but I did that before work instead of after work.  I didnt work a 9am-5pm but a 9pm-5am.  You know I just think wow what a waste that would make me, but I guess you know there isn't a write or wrong way to do things, if thats how it ends up, I just have to find a hot chick that keeps the same sleep schedule, and probably works at Kroger because thats the only place I can think of that employs people that work those hours, haha.  Also I guess since Mike said somthing it is important to note that me and Kendra talked and it will never happen.  Im happy and ok about it, I was pretty much just grasping at somthing to hope for, sort of like you crazy christians, I couldn't stand reality so I had to find somthing to hope for which was her, and for you all its heaven, both aren't gonna happen, but they give you piece of mind at night that everythign will be OK.  Just kidding, I like to pretend to be really anti-christian because it makes me laugh because its so illogical but I still believe in it, and that just confuses me to the point of no end.  I mean if I was born in Saudi Arabia I would be muslim and would believe in Islam but would be subject to the same doubts and applied beliefs because I grew up there.  Ehh but religion is not somthing I want to talk about, allthough I just did, which makes me about as hypocritcal as my religious beliefs, which in turn is ironic, and irony and hypocrasy are my two favorite things, no lie I think they are both the two funniest forms of comedy, so I will end it at that.  Ohh and also I will be 23 in 2 days, judging from Mike's appearance Im not magically gonna look really old in 48 hours, but none the less when everyone in class giggled at me when they asked if it was my 21st and I said no 23rd I came to the realization that I am too old to be in Lexington, and I know I'm not alone."

"event","I can't remember the last time I actually wrote in this, and im positive this won't be long enough to really exspress what I want to get out.  However I will give it a valiant attempt, its the least I could do.  Well I will say that lately I have been trying to less spontanious than I have been the rest of the semester.  Not that I am not having the greatest time ever in my life, its just that sometimes you need to make sure shit is getting done, and im not sure I am doing that right now.  So I basically need to do a quick check making sure I am going towards my goals, and also reestablish some goals.  Honestly I know that if you have to write this down or even think about this, you probably have somthing wrong with you, thinking is a cancer, and I really believe that.  However with the amount of fun I have been having basically just hanging out with friends and having a blast, its kinda making me think what is really important.  I guess I was just going after wealth and posessions before, but the stock answer was always love would always trump that, but then again I dont think i was ever true to that.  Anyways I really want to be content with whatever, fuck money, or stuff, or whatever.  I just want to be happy and have a great time, cause you never know how it will boil down in the end.  I just want to get threw school and then at that point do whatever, but I need to remmeber i have to get through with school first, sometimes im getting ahead of that.  Anyways I just was reading letters I wrote on my computer earlier this year.  Anyways I wrote this really long letter about somthing and I wrote at the end ""And the most important thing you taught me Kendra is too not settle, never ever, and I wont, because the only person I want is you, I wont settle till I get you.""  And basically this is the biggest decision every week i change my mind what im gonna do, and every week its another day I go without speaking a word to her, and making it less likely, and just pretending that it will work itself out.  Well destiny is destiny, but it can never happen if you never try.  And for all the Sarah's and Veronica's and Shelby's out there Ill never have a chance with any of them if I cant figure out what the fuck im gonna do with these feelings for another girl."

"event","SO I guess my entry earlier is creepy.  And its not like im a bad place, I just feel totally like complacent.  Usually htat is what I strive for, as lame as that is, but right now its just not working.  I mean I am just working, which i dont like so much, but its not bad, then goign to class, which i hate eminsly.  And when im not doing that im sitting on here, watching sports or going out, and im having a ton of fun, but like, I mean there is no future in it, im just doing whatevers good at the moment, and i hate living like that.  I just kinda want like somthing to look forward to or somthing, and I dont so much have that, all i really have is this move home, but I mean when I get there, then what.  Ehhh and then like you know this Steve and Mike shit just makes me feel shittier, I mean really its because it seems all my friends just have it together a little more than me.  They both are heading for awsome careers, with girls who in at least my opinion are perfect for them. And there two of the guys I have the highest opinion of, and think have done a ton for me. I dont know it just seems maybe a year ago I was kinda in the same boat and now I really dont know, and worse i dont care.  But I mean I hate to take away from it its awsome, Im just jealous is all really, and selfish enough to make this about me somehow.  But anyways its good that I have all these friends setting such good examples for me, maybe ill pick it up someday, and act 22, or maybe ill go through my whole life, and never get it, but hey ignorance is bliss they say."

"event","So somthing just happened that i never pictured in my wildest dreams, the most amazing thing.   Well there is this girl that I guess I have liked for over two years, not just kind of but just so much that I just sit an stare at her screen name and wish I could ever be cool enough to make out with her or touch her or be with her, or just be part of her life.  Just knowing her is amazing.  Well tonight somthing happened that was just too much for me to take.  It was the greatest yet most dissapointing thing ever, but I  cant stop smiling.  I almost kissed Sarah, and if youve read my xanga or anything like that you know how much i like her, I cant even explain, but just the fact that she might even want to kiss me at somepoint has made every part of my body tingle, and made me feel like a 14 year old school girl, i just cant take it.  It is one of those moments where every song relates to you and everything anyone things, says or does, is irrelevant cause the most beautiful girl that ever existed is staring you in the eyes and she just may want to kiss you and that is all youve ever lived for.  It is jsut too much to handle I cant even go on, but I cant believe what just happened, and I am so amazed and happy, and anticipatatory and it is just everything i ever wanted."

"event","So for the last couple of nights I have been having really crazy dreams and waking up in the middle of the night all the time.  They are starting to really bother me because I can't sleep, and they are sligthly upsetting.  Not to mention I don't want to go to sleep cause I would rather try and avoid having these dreams if I could.  But anyways in all these dreams people who are really close to me say the things that I guess I have always been afraid they would say, or they bring up situations I have been trying to avoid.  Like for instance last night I had the same dream about five times, like different situations, but the same type of message anyways someone i really care about just told me over and over that Ill never be good enough for them, and they hate me etc... so everytime I woke up, I was freaked out, and then went to lseep only to dream the same thing over again.  It is kind of like a bad movie though, this has happened about 7 days in a row now.  I guess I just really have some sort of subconcious issue I need to deal with, some insecurity or somthing or other that I am failing to deal with directly.  Anyways one more night of this, and I will refuse to sleep ever again.  And what makes last night 10 times weirder is the person who I was dreaming about called me like at 3am, first time in 3 months, which just makes it even odder."

"event","OK So i keep reading all these polls about how Louisville is going to walk away with the Big East.  So here are points I would like to make about this statement.

1.  The Big East is horrible, Pitt and UofL are the two best teams, thats pathetic for a BCS conference.
2.  People rave about how good they were last year.  Well they played only one team in the top 40 in college football and got beat.
3.  They are supposed to have the best offense in the country.  Well first off they played no one at all, ill give you that they got 500 yards on Miami, however so did VaTech because Miami was pathetic against the spread last year.  Boise State would have had 1000 yards against them.
4.  They really don't have good talent.  They have Brohm, hes probably NFL bound but all there other players are system players.  This will win you conference USA every year, but the talent in the Big East as shitty as it is will give them fits.
They have a team full of mid major players, and though they go after big timers they don't get them.  There best players are all JUCO's.
5.  There defense is shitty.  They lost several seniors, on a Defense that gave 700 yards up to a horrible Miami offense and almost 800 to Memphis who is not a top 40 team.  West Virginia and Pittsburgh will crush them if they give up those kind of yards.

Anyways the point is the Big East is not a BCS conference its a joke."

"event","So at home for the summer and this horrible thing happened.  I can no longer access any of my old password protected stuff.  See I had this program that aloud me to remember all the passwords and account names to these kind of sites.  Well now I cant recall any of them and can't figure out how to get on them.  So anyways I am no longer able to get on my Xanga or Live Journal accounts, cause i have no idea what the passwords were.  So now instead of just ridiculing everyone privately I think I am just going let people read it.

AND SOMEONE JUST SIGNED ON MY SN THIS IS ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT THAT REQUIRES CAPS LOCK. ACTUALLY I AM JUST HOLDING DOWN SHIFT, NONE THE LESS I'M STILL PISSED OFF.  THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON THAT CAN HAVE IT AND I HAVE HER PASSWORD TOO, SO I WILL TOTALLY GET ON YOUR NAME TOO, JUST FOR PRINCIPLE AND BECAUSE I HAVE LITTLE TO DO.

So anyways ill craft a tale that will make this entry worth reading perhaps.  So I just started this job at Don Pablos on the river.  Its cool working on the river and the restaurant is huge and the people are cool so far.  They are training 5 other servers with me, one is an anorexic looking guy who laughs at everything and I cant figure him out but he freaks me out.  Then there is this guy who graduated from Michigan State or at least went there, for some reason he is in Cincinnati and he is a career server, I cant figure out this guys career path, but he kisses the managements ass already so maybe hes trying to get into management or something who knows.  Third their is this girl shes really good looking, nice, and I have nothing to say about her. Then their is this guy who I think maybe Danish hes crazy he introduced himself and instead of saying Hi my name is ____ he used like 20 words and he condensed them into like two seconds, it was amusing and confusing.  And lastly their is this guy, he spent 2 years at UK and since I am lying and pretending I go to Northern so I can have this job I am pretending I did the same thing.  However this guy failed out, he also has felt the need to tell me about all the problems hes had in the last week or two, and let me tell you they are crazy and we are not close enough for him to disclose this shit.  So first off he told me how he was kicked out of his house by his parents, not the kind of ice breaker you would expect.  Then the guy started telling me how he got arrested the other night and taken back to his house and his parents got really mad cause they already kicked him out and now they are giving him no money for school or to live.  So this guy is fucked and he keeps trying to tell me his sob stories, and my cover story is that I just got back to NKY and am looking for a place to live.  So naturally this dude is trying to become my roommate, sucks for him cause my story is made up.  But this guy is trying to be my best friend and get me to bail his ass out, but I cant let him know because I can and will be fired, they made sure I knew that.  So anyways its kind of a weird situation.  But this guy is way crazy who starts out by telling people that shit, so moral of the story I guess when you meet people don't tell them all these bad stories and try to make yourself seem hard, unlucky, miserable or whatever, just shut up and be cool.

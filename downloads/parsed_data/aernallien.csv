"event","I've been looking at colleges and preparing for auditions and such! Wow...exciting...but it's gonna get super stressful later T_T Thought I'd announce (to Alyssa, specifically) that the main college I'm looking at is the San Francisco Conservatory of Music! It's the only music conservatory on the west coast and it looks really good. So, Alyssa....if you happen to come across any info about it up there, please let me know! I'm dying to go there. I don't really want to go to SF but a school like that is worth it when there's only two drawbacks: place and price. And in any case, if I'm accepted I'll at least know one person there. Also...since I probably won't be online again by Oct. 5th, Happy Early Birthday, Alyssa! You are missed terribly (by me)."

"event","Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
Got what I paid for now
See ya tomorrow, hey Frank can I borrow
A couple of bucks from you?
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English and everything's broken
And my Stacy's are soaking wet
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you buried the dagger
Your silhouette window light
To go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinaman and the cold-blooded signs
And the girls down by the strip-tease shows
Go, waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

No, I don't want your sympathy
The fugitives say that the streets aren't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go, waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

And you can ask any sailor and the keys from the jailor
And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Matilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll go a waltzing Matilda with me

And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace
And a wound that will never heal
No primadonna, the perfume is on 
An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey 
And goodnight to the street sweepers
The night watchman flame keepers and goodnight to Matilda too"

"event","She hangs her head and cries on my shirt.
She must be hurt very badly.
Tell me what's making you sadly?
Open your door, don't hide in the dark.
You're lost in the dark, you can trust me.
'Cause you know that's how it must be.

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

Her eyes like windows, tricklin' rain
Upon her pain getting deeper.
Though my love wants to relieve her.
She walks alone from wall to wall.
Lost in a hall, she can't hear me.
Though I know she likes to be near me.

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

She sits in a corner by the door.
There must be more I can tell her.
If she really wants me to help her.
I'll do what I can to show her the way.
And maybe one day I will free her.
Though I know no one can see her.

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa. 

---------------

I realized something very shocking last night. It sort of struck some fear into me. The fact that I even housed the ability to feel as I do is a shock. It's scary and it hurts. 

I'm being ambiguous. And I like it that way."

"event","yeah...you guys probably saw it coming. Apush essays are due tomorrow and I procrastinated. And I mean badly. I had really detailed outlines all ready and everything, but I just kept waiting to write the actual essays...I had 3 done...or rather...each was mostly done with need of minor additions. Yeah...so i just finished one of the hardest ones on the list. So my progress was slow because of the hardness so I now have 4 done. You all know how many I have to do...seriously now, do the math. I'm not very proud of myself. Though I must say that the really hard essay was done pretty damn well. Ugh...only 11 more to go before 10 am tomorrow...I almost wish I was a senior so I could skip testing. Which I might just have to do and make up later. There aren't grades involved in CST testing, so they can kiss my ass. I want a friggin good grade in apush. Hopefully my mom is understanding enough to allow it. Right, See ya'll tomorrow. I'm sure I'll have bags under my eyes."

"event","I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said:""Old Chevy"" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year,or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand

It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
Thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp
When I pulled the cover off,it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty six Corvette

I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
But what a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box and that's when I found the note
The date was nineteen-sixty six and this is what it wrote:

He said,""My name is Private Andrew Malone""
""If you're reading this,then I didn't make it home""
""But for every dream that shattered,another one comes true""
""This car was once a dream of mine,now it belongs to you""
""And though you may take her and make her your own""
""You'll always be riding with Private Malone""

Well it didn't take me long at all,I had her running good
I love to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood
I had her shining lika a diamond and I'd put the rag top down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town

The buttons on the radio didn't seem to work quite right
But it picked up that oldie show,especially late at night
I'd get the feeling sometimes,if I turned real quick I'd see
A soldier riding shotgun in the seat right next to me

It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered,another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his,back when it was new
He told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be riding with Private Malone

One night it was raining hard,I took the curve too fast
I still dont remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They didn't get his name, but I know without a doubt

It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that's shattered,another one comes true
This car was once a dream of his,back when it was new
I know I wouldn't be here if he hadn't tagged along
That night I was riding with Private Malone
Oh,thank God,I was riding with Private Malone"

Will we all get our chance? The chance that we so greatly deserve? No. But the world isn't even really a Darwinian one anymore (among humans, anyway). Those of us who should succeed, do not, and those who shouldn't, do. There are stupid people running the country, stupid people on our highways...not being victims of accidents...but getting by on luck. Meanwhile...those of us with intellect are constantly put down for the very thing that could save us. But for many, it causes us to give up because we see past the charades. We lack the ability to <i>work with</i> the system because we are so stubborn in our ways. We who have everything that the world wants...We become unwanted because of one single flaw. Would that make us the collective runt? While these successful people harbor less than half the ability both mentally and physically, <i>they</i> win. For those of you who are confused by my ranting...perhaps pair my hard-to-understand explanation with the UCLA admissions. Weird stuff. 

The new modern successful person should be able to suck up (whether it be with flattery, manipulation, or seduction), make the best alliances at the perfect time, harbor some great charisma, know a little bit about his/her trade, pretend to be amazing...and the list is endless in that direction of negativity. 

The unsuccessful person is often the best for the field that they fail at, and only lack in the fact that one of the aforementioned traits of success is not available to them. 

Here's where I tell about my part in this, though many of you might know. I am the unsuccessful. I don't play the game. I could give a shit about what they want from me. I'm in it for my friends, family, and myself. But, really, I'm not in it at all because I don't play the game. I have potential in nearly every aspect of mental, physical, and moral....ness (O_o lol maybe not). I could be anything I want to be with the skills I have. I am interested in nearly everything that I come across. I enjoy knowledge. I enjoy discovery. I enjoy imagination. I enjoy sports. I enjoy psychology. The list goes on. I can be anything. After all, didn't my dad tell me that many 'a' time on his knee?

But, no, I can't. The Game is required reading and I skipped that chapter. They want me to do things that don't benefit me mentally, but only help me to someday (possibly) get to a point where I can benefit myself mentally. 

Reality can kiss my ass."

that turn out to be too good to be true.
Against your better judgment, opened up your heart,

About the only way I know how to come,

You won't subject yourself to such pain
If you give me half a chance I will
Never leave you standing out in the rain
But if you think that I could look you in your face and lie right
through my teeth
then turn around and walk away
Cross my heart, girl I care for you and when I look into your eyes i

"event","""The Dance"" by Garth Brooks

Looking back on the memory of
The dance we shared 'neath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance

Holding you, I held everything
For a moment wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say? you know I might have changed it all

And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance

Yes my life, its better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss the dance"

If I hadn't been babysitting (yeah...babysitting a kid who slept the whole freaking time), I would've been able to go out with derrick cuz he was visiting from uci. ah well, there's always next time. I still have to get my damn homecoming dress. Everything is either hoochy coochy or very berry stupid. I saw this really pretty red dress, but it had this stupid ass jewel hanging from the front. It looked weird. I wish I'd found my dress already, i just want to get it overwith. Today is the field show tournament at Scripps Ranch. I'm gonna get to see my ex, which'll be awesome because I'll get to hang out with him a bit on his break. He's pretty much working all day long because his school is hosting the tournament. Beckie and me get to see our friend, ross, from dm camp and i'll make fun of him because he had/has a crush on beckie and she has a boyfriend now but he had his chance so whatever. Uh, yeah. I think that's it. For more whining, ranting, smiling, and glee, visit my <a href=""http://www.xanga.com/aernallien"">xanga</a>. For now, I gotta get ready for call time."

"event","Another late night of rambling and clash of thought. 

Family life isn't exactly going great. There isn't an hour that I don't argue with a parent, a stepparent, a sibling...unless I'm secluded within the confines of my room...which I am. I argue with the mothers most. Mom and stepmom. Both of them have opposite views on a lot of things, but somehow...I manage to be against both sides. They're great people...but I think just living with women is not fun. In fact, it often sucks. I rarely see my dad and I'm locked out of his house anyway because my keys were stolen. I'm just at a point where I enjoy being everywhere, except home. The only time I want to be home is either when my dad's home, or when I need/want to be online.

School is pretty good. It's hard and I won't have the best grades for the progress report, but it'll even out as I get used to the homework load. I already am getting better. I'm more organized than I was, not only last year, but in the beginning of this year. My only problem is my lack of sleep. I have had a lot of trouble staying awake in classes. This is also getting better as I get used to being awake 18-20 hours a day. 

Band is cool. It has its obvious problems that need fixing, but I think we'll be okay.
Orchestra is absolutely awesome, as is seminar. I swear...I have so many peer families now. It's wonderful.

Love life is lame, as usual. It's practically inevitable. 

Upcoming school events: 

Homecoming Game is gonna be awesome. We'll probably lose, but everything else will be great. The band will rock and we'll have the gold medalist from the Olympics 400m sprint, who is a graduate of UC, visiting. So basically, publicity MAJOR. If it goes well, we might be able to finally get lights (and TURF!!) for the school stadium. Imagine...last year, nearly 5000 people showed to our Homecoming game. Our team sucked last year too! But people came. I'm thinking, if we had night games, more people would show...which means more money to the school...which means better funds for everything...and more people supporting the school in the community. We have to tap into this community. It's a fairly rich community with a fairly nonrich school...so why not combine them and make the school better. Among all these great things, school spirit will increase a ton! We have none now, but it'll be so much more fun if everyone gets into it. I know that most people can't get into it because other people aren't. Basically, I think the lights are a great investment. 

As for the dance, it'll probably be fun. I have tons of friends in several ""families"" who are going happily. Maybe I'll get everyone to take a big picture. That'd be awesome. (lol...awesome is such an awesome word, isn't it? I think it's just awesome. Don't you think it's awesome?) One of my friends asked this girl to HC...I've been teasing him because I never expected him to randomly, after never talking much about girls and stuff, ask someone. But yeah, I told him I know he'd treat me the same if the situation were reversed. In fact, I'd probably be teased more than him =P 

Ah well...and that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm Kaity, signing out."

"event","Confusion is just a thing that sets in. Long lost memories and feelings stirring, while new ones are conjured simultaneously. Lovely. Perfect timing too...Of all things, I don't think I need love during my junior year. It's hard enough. But unfortunately, I can't live without being near people, near someone. What can I say? I guess I'm just a social person. I wish I didn't want it. It just adds to the already chaotic struggle between mind and matter. Self-control. Mind power. My ultimate philosophy fails me. While I'm still controlling my immune system with my mind, other things that I once controlled easily are falling away. I can't concentrate on my school work for very long and things are falling apart. I don't want a repeat of last year and, while I doubt it will repeat, I'm having those same early difficulties...Mind over matter...mind over matter...

I think I might be developing some sort of mental sickness. If not that, at least a physical sickness. I can't breathe very well and I frequently have coughing fits. It's been going on for months now. I've definitely developed a fear of closed spaces and big crowds. I can barely stand being in my room without the window open. My breathing is worse when I'm in those scenarios. I don't know what's wrong with me.

"event","I'm so freaking pathetic. I have no organization skills and I'm losing things already! The very first day....then the second...then today. But not again! (please...) I really think something is trying to mess everything up for me...maybe for some bad thing I did in a past life. They let me glimpse my potential greatness, then form millions of obstacles to keep me from achieving it. I really do try. Not like living in two places - a half hour away from eachother, no less - has helped much.

Busy week, busy school, too much homework...and now, a busy weekend. But it least it's the fun kind of busy and not the annoying/boring kind of busy.

History? I love History! First one thing happens...then another thing happens...
So sequential...Thank you, First Guy, for writing history down. Let's study!

for those who are vaguely interested:

1: AP Chem
2: Orchestra
3: APUSH
4: Sm. Am. Lit.
5: PreCalc
6: Band
7: More Band!"

So I tried every program on my desktop. None of them worked except My Computer and My Documents! So I went to open Add/Remove Hardware....that won't open either. I seriously wanted to kill someone.

"event","I don't like randomly finding cuts and scabs, especially when I don't know where the hell they came from. Take this cut on my thumb, for instance, I just noticed it and I can't figure out where it came from and it suddenly hurts a little now. EH!!! poop...at least I didn't notice it when I was cutting that lemon earlier. Anyway, since this entry is short, I'll add a lyric to it:

He can't remember 
The times that he thought
Does my daddy love me?
Probably not
That didn't stop him
From wishing that he did
Didn't keep him from wanting
Or worshipping him

He guesses he saw him
About once a year
He could still feel the way he felt
Standing in tears
Stretching his arms out
As far as they'd go
Whispering dad
I want you to know

[Chorus:]
I love you this much 
And i'm waiting on you
To make up your mind
Do you love me too?
How ever long it takes
I'm never giving up 
No matter what
I love you this much

He grew to hate him for what he had done
'cause what kind of father
Could do that to his son?
He said 'damn you daddy'
The day that he died
The man didn't blink
But the little boy cried

[Chorus:]
I love you this much 
And i'm waiting on you
To make up your mind
Do you love me too?
How ever long it takes
I'm never giving up 
No matter what
I love you this much

Half way through the service
While the choir sang a hymn
He looked up above the preacher
And he sat and stared at him

He said
'forgive me father' 
When he realized
That he hadn't been unloved
Or alone all his life
His arms were stretched out 
As far as they'd go
Nailed to the cross
For the whole world to know

[Chorus:]
I love you this much 
And i'm waiting on you
To make up your mind
Do you love me too?
How ever long it takes
I'm never giving up 
No matter what
I love you this much"

But that first guy did this awesome thing where he brought up his hand and reached behind him and pulled his conducting baton out of his shirt. Yeayah!!! And...one of the bands did a hilarious encore! I was dying. There were these guys near us who kept saying ""DUDE! THAT WAS PHAT!"" XD Funny stuff."

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of crown
And everybody's getting down 
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same.

(Chorus:)
Cause I saddle up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling- Blanging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

And I saddle up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway

And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy



(Spoken:)
I'm a thourough-bred
that's what she said
in the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road.
We where flying high
Fining, whine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.
But her evaluation
of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
all night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of

And we made love
And I saddled up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

What? What?
Save A Horse Ride A Cowboy
Everybody says
Save a Horse Ride a cowboy."

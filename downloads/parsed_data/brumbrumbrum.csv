"event","Hiya everyone! I just wanted to apologise for being such a crappy penpal lately and not keeping this updated or replying to letters or emails or anything like that.. As some of you know already, I am currently 9 weeks pregnant with baby #2 and having a really rough time at the moment. I'm sick constantly and spend far too much time asleep! So I have little energy for writing letters and my pile of mail I have to reply to is growing bigger and bigger.. I'm hoping that in the next couple of weeks, when I reach the second trimester, things will have improved and I'll be back to my normal letter writing self again, but in the meantime please bear with me and don't think I've forgotten about you!

I hope you're all happy & well!
x

PS: I forgot to mention - I have now stopped swapping normal FBs so please please please don't send me any more! I have been inundated these past couple of weeks! As a result, I have absolutely tons of excess that needs passing on so if you'd like any of them then let me know & I'd be happy to send them to you! I am now only swapping the neat booklet FBs through private swaps/yahoo groups and also mums only FBs. Thanks!"

Anyway, waiting for me when I got home were FBs from Tanja in Belgium & Sharon in Essex and letters from Tammy and Angela, both in the USA. I managed to get a few letters out the way whilst I was away & will be sending them out tomorrow to Kim in Cornwall, Anna in Surrey and Mirjan in Holland.

"event","Oh my gosh, I have just discovered this really exciting thing! (Well, I guess it's only exciting if you live in the UK!) (and possibly only if you're sad like I am!), but on the Royal Mail website you can actually buy stamps and <i>print them off online!</i> Which means you need never queue up at the horrible old post office ever again! Unfortunately you do have to type the senders name onto the label that you print off, which means that all your envelopes will look a bit official like and boring, and also your pals that receive them may think that they're being sent a court summons or something because the address is so official looking, but still.. I think it's a small price to pay for not having to go to the post office!! Website is <a href=""http://www.royalmail.com/onlinepostage"">here!</a>"

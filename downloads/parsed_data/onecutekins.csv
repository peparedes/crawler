One last lingering reminder of the storm the day before.  This was the SMALLEST branch that fell off of the 7 100 year old trees we have in the yard... T_T  It was taking our power all night long and BY CHANCE once of the workers that had been working through the night to clear trees and get power back up in a three county radius was on his way home on our BACK COUNTRY ROAD and happen to see the tree, at 2am mind you, and stopped to cut it from the line.  PRAISE GOD!!!<BR>

Jared and I wed on August 1st, 2008.  The day before a HUGE storm came in (I have NEVER experienced a storm like this!!)  Me, my mother and my step mother-in-law were on our way to the cities when it hit.  It literally ripped the 100year old trees in our yard to shreds, took out the power and DESTROYED the venue.  Instead of prepping the tent, the guys spent all day chain sawing and hauling wood, try to clean up the space for the tents.  Poor things!  We had no power and it was just BAD.  We weren't able to finish all of the details (Considering on a handful of family helped) but otherwise, the day was PERFECT!!!

"event","Okay... so last night I had my very first gallbladder attack >_>  I dont even know how to spell gall, but it was the most painful experience I've had to date.  I mean breaking my leg/ripping ligaments was a walk in the park compared to this.  I spent my whole night (Or till about 4am) trying to sit through the pain and feel and watch carefully to make sure nothing serious was happening inside.  I just couldn't afford to go in to the ER otherwise I would have X_X

I spent literally (And Im not joking!!) from 9:30 am until now 10:18PM on our couch.  I feel like someone has punched me repeatedly in the torso and the lingering pain is still there inside me from the night before. 

This all, of course, was brought on from 8 months of eating healthy and then moving home and, with the influence of my little sister (haha), eating like crap for 2 weeks straight.  OI.  My diet consisted of rice, bread and apples today and I still feel iffy...

DONT eat like crap... gallballer attacks are absolutely horrible experiences.  Ever had pankrieitus? Kidney stones?  Thats what it felt like...  Horrible >_>

04.19.01
Todays has been an Okay day.  I don't know what to do though.  Sandy and Scott broke up last night, but got back together not long after.  He told her that if she didn't become more spontanious or exciting he would break up with her.

What kind of BF is that????

He's all about the sex and she just can't see that.  I'm sick with worry.  I'm shaking and can't stop.  I don't know how else to help her!  You can't stay with someone who threatens to kill you.  He WAS threatening it... or wishing it at least, even though he denied it later.  He's a master at manipulation and he has her so fooled.  I think hes so good at it that he even fools himself!

Im just afraid Sandy is going to end up dead someday and it will be my fault for not trying harder.

----
Awwww!  I worried so much for my SanSan!! ^_^


Date Unknown
I was very very lonely when my BF and I broke up.  I really loved him and I still do and its very hard to try not to... and be away from him.

Mrs Hanson read a very sad poem about loneliness which made Sandy cry.  Then she played the Beattles which was Scotts favorite band and the song was about being lonely and that mad her cry too... It Sucked!!  Then she left the room.

----

March 23rd 2002
Sandy just found out she has severe scoliosis.  I can't believe I'm moving away from her just when she seems to need me the most.  Jen is getting her life back together.  I hope she means it this time.  And as far as my other so called friends, They aren't friends. (This is so ironic to my current situation.....)

June 14th 2002
I miss Sandy.  I wish she hadn't changed.

June 21st 2002
Sandy isn't my friend anymore.  I am sad.  Jen and Angie are with me to the end, I see that now.  I've never had friends like them.  I'm very thankful for everything and everyone.  (lol!  What the hell!  It seems things are the exact opposite...  Sandy is the only pal I have left......)

July 1st 2002 
I keep dreaming about Sandy.  Have every night since we left.  I wish we were still friends.

August 17th 2002
I miss Angie, Jen and Sandy =-_-=

September 25th 2002
Missing my friends.

December 26th 2002

Final project, Graphic Design I.  Made one of the few 100% handed out in course history and my work was submitted to the student gallery which only showcases some 30-40 pieces out of the entire school.  goodie :)

Working on school, business and horses.

Here is my latest school project.  It sucks, was stupid and not fun to do, but at least it's done.

<img src=""http://www.josieroetman.com/school/postcard.jpg"">

Next project... HARD, but super fun...  Everything had to be hand made like the old time 1940s ads.  Not finished yet, obviously :)  Lots of marker, pencil and painting work went into it and still not finished... uuugggh V_V

I miss writing and loving to write and loving to write with people I love.  I think I hate it now.  

I miss the good friend Sera was.  I wish she wasn't so bitter and angry and self absorbed in being sorry for herself all the time.

I miss being a part of Tito's life.  I miss being worth his time.

I miss my sister Nadiya.  I wish she wouldn't lie so much.  I wish she cared about more then just herself.  I'm afraid for her.

I miss Sandy and Angela and Jack and Nick, my true friends.  I miss their love and their company and their acceptance.

I miss a lot of things lately.  All which make me cry if I roam to closely to them.  Now that I've done what I needed to do, I'll stuff them all away again to save myself the hurt."

A new journal.  

I hope to take this one to levels beyond silly side notes and ridiculous rants about stupid friends or family and the likes.  I truly am tired of the drama and most of all, the pain.  Perhaps this will help me separate from that?  Even though no one can really disconnect from the human condition, fresh things are just that, fresh, and though in time this journal will rot like all things do, I can at least enjoy its new car smell while it lasts ;)

Tito, I love you.

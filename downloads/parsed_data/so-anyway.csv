apparently our web mistress's new fancy dancy computer is encrypting too difficult of a code for poor internet explorer to read....

so she's going to dumb it down a tad.

but, if you're interested in reading the affected CD reviews (some girls, the dead betters, under 21 comp, jenny lewis, the elected, wooden wand and the vanishing voice and corm) you can download the new fancy dancy browser firefox.

thanks for your patience. if you don't want to download firefox, wait til this weekend. she's fixing it over the next two days, because that's how cool she is...

"event","But I was relieved when I heard Richard Pryor had died. Everyone's saying ""goodbye to the laughs"" and other shit like that, but my God, have any of you seen the shape he was in over the past decade or so? Multiple Sclerosis ravaged the poor man's body, and he was a shadow of his former self even in 1997's ""Lost Highway"" (where he had a small cameo).

I fucking hate when people make the death of someone famous whose relevancy* has passed such a huge tragedy in their own life. Wherever Richard Pryor is, I'm sure he's grateful to have his suffering end. 

Phil Hartman, Chris Farley, Bill Hicks and Sam Kinison dying in their primes were tragedies. Richard Pryor's death was completely different. His death won't leave us with any absences and ""what ifs.""

Rent his concerts on DVD, laugh and learn from a comic legend. Don't act like our culture now has a void that will never be replaced. The real Richard Pryor died years ago--that was the real tragedy.

 

*that is not to say that Pryor's standup is not relevant, but due to his illness he wasn't creating anything new. I suppose I really just mean saying goodbye to the laughs is fucking pointless, because they still exist. Go rent ""Blazing Saddles"""

He broke his neck and fractured his skull. My Dad hit a deer on the way to get there. When he got there my grandfather was in a body bag and there was a pool of blood on the stairs."

"event","Jen and I went to a house show the other day...

The poor people who hosted it...


1,000,000 people showed up because Rob Crow's new band asked to play. It was a nightmare, logistically, for these poor people and their house. BUUT...Mr. and Mrs. Tribute to Ugliness played. And I liked them...


I talked to the guy whose house it was the next night...he was pretty sure they wouldn't be doing it any time soon, and if they did the bands would be tiny...


I'm in the process of trying to book a benefit show for Quintron and other Katrina victims. It's going OK.
Kill me Tomorrow is playing, and The Lipstick Terror (from mexico) will, if their bass player gets a passport in time. apparently it's supposed to arrive next week. jen's dad said he should just crawl in the trunk like all the other illegals. It was said comically, not maliciously. other bands I've contacted so far have personal or business commitments...dammit...I'm still holding out hope that at least one of the following will be able to commit: subtitle, lou barlow, gram rabbit or red sparowes...


I saw business lady the other night...another band that just seems to get better every time i see them. there was a homophobe there who got tossed out of the place by Andreas (which ruled) and much nudity/gay themes throughout the night...including chants of ""gay sex: xbxrx""

the main nude perp even climbed the Che rafters and attempted to have butt sex with one of the microphones.

(note to any bands that might read this livejournal...don't put your face too close to the mic that's dented)


poll: do you think I can pull this off:

9/22 Head Wound City (San Diego)
9/23 John Wilkes Booze (LA)
9/24 The Kills (San Diego)
9/25 Chromatics, Dmonstrations, Mr. and Mrs. Tribute to Ugliness (San Diego--instead of Mono at The Casbah)
9/26 Baseball game with Jen's dad"

I've had a little bit to drink tonight, so forgive me


I'm wondering if www.auralminority.com is worth keeping up...


I mean, every time I call any of the writers it seems like I'm bugging them

and who would blame them



why would they want to write for something they don't get paid for. I mean


fuck. 


we've already had two awesome writers quit.


and I fear two more are on the way.


I can't keep doing this myself.




it's a wonder our webmaster has even stuck around this long. there's a lot of money invested in this project, but no one to gather advertising and none of us knows shit about it...

there's no shame in making money at what you're good at/love

<P>WOODY CREEK, Colo. -- Bill Murray, George McGovern and dozens of Hunter S. Thompson's friends gathered Saturday to give the iconoclastic journalist an unsolemn farewell, with blow-up dolls, liquor and a tower built to blast his ashes into the sky. 
<P>""He loved explosions,"" explained his wife, Anita Thompson. 
<P>She said the tower, shrouded by tarps for days, was modeled after Thompson's Gonzo logo: a clenched fist, made symmetrical with two thumbs, rising from the hilt of a dagger. 
<P>The counterculture author's ashes, intermingled with fireworks, were to be fired from it Saturday evening in a field between Thompson's home and a tree-covered canyon wall. 
<P>Security guards kept reporters and the public away from the writer's Owl Farm compound Saturday as the 250 invited guests arrived, but Thompson's fans scouted the surrounding hills for the best view of the celebration of the author's life. 
<P>""Nothing could ever top this weekend unless someone offered me a job paying $50 an hour for the rest of my life,"" said Trevor Long, a college freshman from Keller, Texas, who became a fan after finding his father's collections of Thompson's writing. 
<P>Thompson killed himself six months ago at his home near Aspen, but the memorial was planned as a party, with plenty of alcohol, reminiscences, readings from Thompson's works and performances by both Lyle Lovett and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 
<P>The author's longtime illustrator, Ralph Steadman, and actors Sean Penn and Johnny Depp, close friends of Thompson, were among the stars on the invitation list. Depp portrayed Thompson in the 1998 movie version of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream,"" perhaps the writer's best-known work. 
<P>""Over the last few months I've learned that he really touched people more deeply than I had realized,"" said Thompson's son, Juan. 
<P>Thompson's longtime friend George Stranahan lamented the Hollywood-style production. 
<P>""I am pretty sure it isn't how Hunter would have done it,"" Stranahan said. ""But when your friends make a mistake you support them."" 
<P>Anita Thompson said Depp funded much of the celebration. 
<P>""We had talked a couple of times about his last wishes to be shot out of a cannon of his own design,"" Depp told The Associated Press last month. ""All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out."" 
<P>Thompson was credited along with Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese with helping pioneer New Journalism -- he dubbed his version ""gonzo journalism"" -- in which the writer was an essential component of the story. 
<P>He often portrayed himself as wildly intoxicated as he reported on figures such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. At the height of the Watergate era, he said Richard Nixon represented ""that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character."" 
<P>Besides the 1972 classic about Thompson's visit to Las Vegas, he also wrote an expose on the Hell's Angels and ""Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72,"" in which the central character was a snarling, drug- and alcohol-crazed observer and participant. 
<P>The Kentucky-born writer also was the model for Garry Trudeau's balding ""Uncle Duke"" in the comic strip ""Doonesbury."" 
<P>In this now-chic resort community, he proudly fired his guns whenever he wanted, let peacocks have the run of the land and ran for sheriff in 1970 under the Freak Power Party banner. 
<P>Thompson shot himself in his kitchen Feb. 20, apparently unable to handle his declining health. One close acquaintance suggested Thompson did not want old age to dictate the circumstances of his death. Anita Thompson said no suicide note was left. 
<P>Composer David Amram, a friend of Thompson since the early 1960s, said Thompson had never expected to be successful taking on President Nixon during the Watergate era. ""He thought he would be banned or put on an enemies' list,"" he said. 
<P>Thompson made himself the centerpiece of his stories ""to show that a regular person could be in the midst of the craziness of the time,"" Amram said. ""He was our historian.""</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>"

"event","Well, Broken Flowers was a delightful little film. Though, I can't help but think of it as ""Lost in Translation"" part deux....the return trip home.

After the movie Jen and I had to stop to get gas. As she parked and went to get out of the car, we noticed we were unintentionally being mooned by a girl getting gas in the car next to us. She was wearing one of those tennis skirt type dealies, either with a thong or no underwear, because we totally saw lots of ass. We weren't sure if she was drunk or an idiot (probably not mutually exclusive) but the fact she and her friend had a Tennessee license plate tilted it toward the latter. Someone, somewhere, got some that night. 

Then some dude pulls up who looks JUST like Steve Verstrate. He's blaring ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."" Except he was a total tool...one of those guys who wears his shirt collars up instead of the way you're supposed to. 

I thought I was in a David Lynch movie written by Richard Linklater or something.


Anyway, the only reason we saw Broken Flowers last night was because the Des_Ark show I was supposed to go to got canceled because of plumbing issues at The Che Cafe. Luckily I got in touch with the band and they're listing me tonight for their show in Anaheim, due to its being sold out. I can't wait because their ""Loose Lips Sink Ships"" really is my favorite album of this year so far...

On Friday night Jen and I saw Our Lady Peace at Brick By Brick, a venue I'll most likely never go to again. It was, honestly, too Buffalo Bar-ish for my liking. And the fans were strange. They were those people who have like 5 favorite bands: Our Lady Peace, Creed, Pearl Jam, maybe Stone Temple Pilots and Maybe Soundgarden. Anyway, the tickets were like 7 bucks and it was for charity.

Well, immediately upon hitting the stage I could tell the band was Canadian. They all looked like Barenaked Ladies/Moxy Fruvous types, except for the singer. He was actually pretty fucking intense live, and I couldn't help but think what a drug problem and more creative musicians behind him would have done for his career. They played mostly new songs, which seemed to be emulating some sort of Pearl Jam meets U2 aesthetic, which wasn't annoying but didn't bowl me over either. It was pretty much what I expected there...

But let me tell you: They ended the show with a killer rendition of ""Starseed,"" the first song I ever heard from them back in 1997. But, it was also indicative of how big of a let down their career has been: The guitarist was wailing on his guitar, and you could tell his emotions were getting the better of him and he was about to start improv-ing, but he stopped and just started punching his guitar instead. 

To me, it was the epitome of major label/expectational/""sellout"" restraint. 

They also played ""Clumsy,"" ""Naveed"" and ""Superman's Dead"" which were, indeed, worth the price of admission."

Well. I shouldn't say that. I can make hide nor hair of it because I was there...but to make this work as an article will probably take everything I've got...

upcoming shows I'm going to try to hit. we'll see if it actually happens. (these are all San Diego with the exception of the 9/1 locust show in Anaheim. after getting Pnuemonia I'm going to skip LA shows for a while. UNLESS--John Wilkes Booze doesn't come to San Diego in the neighborhood of 10/21 like they're supposed to. Then I'll gladly hike on up...)

Finished up my John Wilkes Booze interview. I hope I did all right with it, since they're one of my top 10 favorite bands right now...

Watched Constantine. I think I liked it, but I'm not sure because every single line in the movie was whispered and mumbled. 

Saw The Island as well. It was pretty decent, though there were a few Eh? moments. bloody. kinda gruesome.

I haven't really gotten any good promos lately."

i also had a tasty sammich for lunch...

"event","I just went through about 30ish promos, so Ilana, Nick, Dan, Steve, John and the new Nick can expect packages pretty soon. Dan's going to get the most, I think, though John is close. I'm going to wager that it'll be a toss-up between Nick and Dan as to who got the best bands, with Ilana coming a close third and Steve a close fourth (he's getting mostly instrumental stuff). new Nick has three comps coming his way though, so I'm sure he's going to get a decent amount of decent music...

the flaming lips doc came from netflix today. this excites me more than the free suicide girls doc i got from Epitaph that doesn't come out until August 30th. It's kinda crappy. i had no idea the founder of suicide girls was this kinda dorky girl who is veeery non-eloquent. 

""Um, yeah, so I decided to take pictures and had no idea it was going to branch out this far. it's a worldwide phenomenon""

Oh, really? Hot naked punk chicks? There's a market for that? Whoa!

Anyway, the DVD's just softcore porn. I thought it'd be a little more interesting than watching a girl perform live (or sometimes staged) then watching her strip for a photo shoot, then moving on to the next girl.

But I don't really know what else to expect. it's pretty much just a PR doc, not a documentary discussing the relevancy of a modern day burlesque in today's society. The closest they come to poignancy is when they say, ""It's like a modern day burlesque show"" and ""Burlesque is becoming more popular these days""

Oh. Thanks.

I'm crabby because it's hot, mostly. But, yeah, after about the third girl I turned it off. perhaps it got better, though i'm not holding my breath.

The theme of the documentary seemed to be ""I never thought I'd be able to/I never even thought about posing naked before because I don't have a perfect body""

Sorry, but have you seen the Suicide Girls? Not a plumper in sight...yikes. 




I'm not even sure what I'm saying anymore..."

that's the plan at least.

I'd like to stay at the Business Lady show to see Veronica Lipgloss, but Jen hasn't seen KMT yet, and they really are a thing of beauty. 

I just FINALLY landed an interview with Jonah after all kinds of annoying ""not landings"" and I'm also going to be chatting with the glorious Seth of John Wilkes Booze as well.

Who, incidentally, will be playing out here soon, apparently with Mae-Shi.

I started watching Eraserhead the other night, but wasn't in the mood for it. Perhaps I needed a 40, a Nick and and a few ex-girlfriends in the house.

Gavin Rossdale's new band is playing the Casbah. I'd love to go just for the shear comedic value, but it's $25. and $50 between Jen and me is too much for a laugh (unless it's like David Cross or ""Spamalot"" or something like that) even if Rossdale's band features former members of Rival Schools AND Helmet."

"event","Jen and I pulled a double header of sorts yesterday, taking in a Dodgers/Padres game in San Diego followed by Enon, Thunderbirds are Now! and Sparrows.

We arrived just as Sparrows hit the stage...their sound (not them playing but what came out of the amps) was ridiculously loud for what kind of music they were playing (imagine Ben Folds with violins but without the personality and hilarious wordplay). They were so Canadian they didn't even say ""aboot."" They said, ""aboat.""

Thunderbirds are Now! were another Frenchkiss Records band I didn't like when I heard their album (Smoke and Smoke being the other), but after seeing them live, I'm in love...Imagine Q and Not U, but rock n roll. Sort of. 

Then Enon played. I think Toko was sick...she sang the first few songs (the ones that are delicate and electronic-ish and seem like they could have been on the lost in translation soundtrack) but not much else until the encore.

But when John took over the band got significantly heavier and it was, to say the least, awesome.



oh...and i'm fucking sick. not sure what it is, but my whole body is achey and ihave a little bit of a cough.

I've been busy as hell of late. I seem to be getting an average of at least 2 promos a day. Usually it's five in one day, none the next, three the next, one the next, none the next, then four more.

But I can't say I'd rather be doing anything else. 

Went up to L.A. last night to see the fabulous new incarnation of Rose For Bohdan. Got some amazing shots. Will post a link to them and others when they go up on the site. (Out Hud were more than photogenic) 

Saw Trekkies two. It was not even remotely as amazing as the first one, but that's ok. The ""filk"" and Klingon Metal band were totally worth it. 

Ran into Sonny from Year Future, Justin, Bobby and Gabe from the Locust and Zack and K8 from Kill Me Tomorrow the other day at a show. Then saw Zack and Bobby a few days later at The Peppermints. I see Bobby at every show I go to. It makes me laugh. 

I'm rather scatter brained right now lots of f-ed up shit is going on back home (essentially my dad's developed paranoid schizophrenia. i wish i was exaggerating) it's pretty perilous back there now, and I'm stuck out here. but Zack is coming out to visit, so that's nice/fun/etc. I'm going to take him up to L.A. to see Business Lady and Year Future and also hopefully a baseball game. the neighbor kid is gonna take him surfing...

i just feel rather helpless, selfish, angry, depressed one moment, then happy the next (like when I found out the site got 8,000 some-odd hits yesterday, 3,000 more than our previous high). i'm too old to have to deal with this shit sometimes.


I dunno.

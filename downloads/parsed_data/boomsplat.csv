"event","This has been my favorite song for a long time and will be forever known as a punk rock epic.

""The Decline""

Where are all the stupid people from?
And how'd they get to be so dumb?
Bred on purple mountain range
Feed amber waves of grains
To lesser human beings, zero feelings

Blame it on
Human nature, mans destiny (mans destiny)
Blame it on the greediocracy (greediocracy)
Fear of God
The fear of change
The fear of truth

Add the Bill of Rights, subtract the wrongs
There's no answers
Memorize and sing star spangled songs
When the questions
Aren't ever asked
Is anybody learning from the past?
We're living in united stagnation

Father what have I done?
I took that 22
A gift to me from you
To bed with me each night
Kept it clean
Polished it well
Cherished every cartridge, every shell

Down, by the creek, under brush, under dirt
There's a carcass of my second kill
Down, by the park, under stone, under pine
There's a carcass of my brother William
Brother where, have you gone to?
I swear, I never thought I could
I see so many times
They told me to shoot straight
Don't pull the trigger, squeeze
That will insure a kill
A kill is what you want
A kill is why we breed

The Christians love their guns
The church and NRA
Pray for their salvations
Prey on the lower faiths

The story book's been read
And every line believed
Curriculum's been set
Logic is a threat
Reason searched and seized

Jerry spent some time in Michigan
A twenty year vacation, after all he had a dime
A dime is worth a lot more in Detroit
A dime in California, a twenty dollar fine

Jerry only stayed a couple months
It's hard to enjoy yourself while bleeding out the ass
Asphyxiation is simple and fast
It beats seventeen fun years of being someones bitch

Don't think (Stay)
Drink your wine (Home)
Watch the fire burn (Be)
His problems not mine (Safe)
Just be that model citizen

I wish I had a schilling
(For each senseless killing)
For every senseless killing
I'd buy a government
America's for sale
And you can get a good deal on it
(A good deal on it)
And make a healthy profit
Or maybe, tear it apart
Start with assumption
That a million people are smart
Smarter than one

Serotonin's gone
She gave up, drifted away
Sara fled, thought process gone
She left her answering machine on
The greeting left spoken sincere
Messages no one will ever hear

Ten thousand messages a day
A million more transmissions lay
Victims of the laissez faire
Ten thousand voices, a hundred guns
A hundred decibels turns to one
One bullet, one empty head
Now with Serotonin gone

The man who used to speak
Performs a cute routine
Feel a little patronized
Don't feel bad
They found a way inside your head
And you feel a bit misled
It's not that they don't care, yeah

The television's put a thought inside your head
Llike a Barry Manilow, jingle
I'd like, to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
A symphonic blank stare, yeah
It doesn't make you care (make you care)
Not designed to make you care (make you care)
They're betting you won't care (you won't...)

Place a wager on your greed
A wager on your pride
Why try to beat them when, a million others tried?

We are the whore
Intellectually spayed
We are the queer
Dysfunctionally raised

One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
One more pill to kill the pain
Living through conformity

One more prayer to keep me safe
One more prayer to keep us warm
One more prayer to keep us safe
There's gonna be a better place

Lost the battle, lost the war
Lost the things worth living for
Lost the will to win the fight
One more pill to kill the pain

Na na na na na
La na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

The going get tough, the tough get debt
Don't pay attention, pay the rent
Next of kins pay for your sins
A little faith should keep us safe

Save us
The human, existence
Is failing, resistance
Essential, the future
Written off, the odds are
Astronomically against us
Only moron and genius
Would fight a losing battle
Against the super ego
When giving in is so damn comforting

And so we go, on with our lives
We know the truth, but prefer lies
Lies are simple, simple is bliss
Why go against tradition when we can
Admit defeat, live in decline
Be the victim of our own design
The status quo, built on suspect
Why would anyone stick out their neck?

Fellow members
Club ""We've Got Ours""
I'd like to introduce you to our host
He's got his, and I've got mine
Meet the decline

We are the queer
We are the whore
Ammunition
In the class war
We are worker
We love our queen
We sacrifice
We're soilent green

We are the queer
We are the whore
Ammunition
In the class war

"event","I live in a haze of sleep, sweat, and work.  In no particular order.  Any of these things will happen at nearly any time.  For instance!  Today on my lunch break I went to McDonalds to inhale something greasy because I love to watch myself decay slowly.  When I got back to work I decided that since the boss wasn't there yet I would just lay my head back and take a quick nap in my car.  I was sweaty at the time.  There perfect example.  All three in a go.  Anyway though.  I really don't do much more at home than work, pine, sleep, and drink the occasional beer with my parents.  I haven't smoked a cigarrette since.......Lisa's birthday as far as I can remember.  Yeah my life is so fuckin slow right now.  Whatever.  I don't know why i'd put it in the journal but since I did you lazy bastards better appreciate it.  Ok theres other things to do than fill out random quizzes and write this.  Plus my pillow is only getting softer.

p.s oh yeah.  My older brothers friend has taken to calling my pmox funk train.  Explain that to me somebody.  Oh yeah and one of my friends claims I sound like i'm announcing on the radio all the time.  Any input?"

I won't change it though. Typing at one hundred percent so far.  the scab is too large for us.  We must move again.

' is nick forcing on my world.  i'm sure great books were written under conditions much like these.  A akip in the CD has purt a hug blink in my perception.   makes me flinch.  I notice that I forget what I write as soon as I write it.  It's frighgtening really.   I feel the twitches setting in now.  It must be a sign.  Reduce shield one half power.  detonate alpha brace four four.  Incapacitate the legs bring this mammoth to it's kneees.  Adam stop bringin in your robots.  They march around like little toys of meyhem  Is this some kind of dominance trip man''''''''''''''''''''''''';a trea leaf turned into  a pool of warm morning dew and we swim against to glass eclosure and wonder at the mechanism that heralds our freedome one day.  The sluice mist open at some point.  Else the dam break and be rent into pieces such that it becomes incapabale of holding back the water .  There is no way forme to know if my recording machine has survived this ordeal.  Theres no way to know if you will ever realize that We were theheroic ones.  The rest decided to take the easy route of guarding the perimiter where they face no dnager.  I have noe way to know whether they have made any clntribution to our cause.  Destroy intruders@@@!!!!!!!.  I seem to have fallen down a forested cliff of no great magnitude from my falling position I knew immediately that there were broken vertibrae.  My breatha wheezing hiss as a broken rib punctures myl ung.  SAoon liquid relief flows from my automed.  Registering my shock and productingg a cochtail of drugs made to enhance my attrition vale  I must eat again soon.  Theres no way to appropriate ambush them from here.  We must move across tricky ground to lay at their feet and make sure thattthereweew no domestic pests that could intrude upon their feet and burrow deep leaving their offspring to mature in their hollow near the achilles tendon.  Upon removal total restoration efforts will be made to salvage the remains of the tendon.  Nicks sanity becomes maddening.  When will I be forced to end him.  Theres a girl in my bed.  She's soft and makes mewant to sleep.  She smells vaguely good.  Theres no real reason for the smell to be appealing except that it's distinctly girl.  And I must go investigate more closely.

I think I should find a way to deal with this pool of spit but honestly it's kinda cool shaped.  A little like a camel."

"event","Ok first worthy dream.  I remember being overly angry at a guy in a wheelchair who I for the life of me couldn't catch.  I think it started in a room like my dorm.  There were bunkbeds on both sides and a few things that we don't have in our room like a door in a wierd wall.  So I think I got mad at this guy because he kidnapped my exgirlfriend.  Mostly I just really wanted to beat his ass.  So I start hunting for this guy and I end up in some house that isn't mine but theres a crowd of neighbors outside that are watching me and trying to welcome me into their neighborhood and it was all some joke at my expense by the guy in the wheelchair who resembles the guy in family guy.  so I finally get out of there and I can only think of two things.  Finding Chelsea and killing this bastard with my bare hands.  So I finally manage to get a little closer to finding this guy and he just up and disappears out of the room that he was in.  The room was in the hallway through that door that doesn't exist in my room.  So he disappears but now he's some kind of phantom and he keeps attacking me when I can't see him.  So eventually I catch his head and all there really is is a face that's on the wall.  So I start laying into this guy like I don't want anything as bad in the world but naturally in my dream I could only hit him with about the force of somebody who has no muscle.  So I decided I wasn't doing enough damage fast enough and I was worried that he would find a way to hurt me so I dash off and find myself in some sort of workshop on the back of a church?  Weird enough as it is.  Anyway i'm standing there and as fast as I can i'm cutting up hard rubber for fistpacks.  Anyway I get done with this and pack my fists like a good boy and I go outside to find this guy and I do he's in his wheelchair again against a wall.  So he's getting all lippy with me and i'm getting real pissed he won't tell me where he his Chelsea.  So I start beating him with a passion.  Blackout and next thing I remember i' m in that black hallway again.  SO I walk into the room and I think I catch a glimpse of him on the top of my bed.  Shit i'm mad again so I climb up there as fast as I can and all of a sudden my perception shifts like when i'm droned.  I can barely move fast and my vision isn't tracking well at all.  So I get up there and he's nowhere to be found.  For some reason right here I know that Chelsea is laying in the bed but I haven't looked yet.  So i'm scanning the room with my fucked up vision and I look on a shelf for some reason like I expect this guy to be on them but he isn't.  So I check this shelf near my bed and then the beds right across the way.  He's not anywhere and i'm starting to black out again.  Well I manage to get myself to look at my bed now and right as things are fading I see Chelsea laying there in a long red dress (Not something I remember her having)  The blackout completely stops and things are normal for a second so I look around....shrug.....and lay down with her and fall asleep.  END DREAM.  Then it was wake up time for real and I rolled over in bed fully expecting to see her laying there.  I don't think I should feel sad when I see that she isn't there, even though I know that theres now way she would be."

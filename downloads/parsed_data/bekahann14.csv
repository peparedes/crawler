"event","well.. im proud of myself. ive learned to accept the fact that me and my ex are never goin to be together. and that he really doesnt want to talk to me, even though he says that im still his best buddies. its juz hard to believe him cuz of the way he talks to me and treats me. so i guess im done with that. i want to be his friend and im here.. but its up to him. 

last night kattie got into a big fight with her parents and so me her and chelsie went to steves house. stayed there til 7 in the morning. then me and kattie went to a parade today. it was short and stupid. but it was fun. we met justin there. katties cousin. hes cute. i think that i gotta a crush. lol haha.... anyways.. ill update tomorrow and write some more about my boring life.

"event","me and drakes relationship (if i can even say that we have one) is at a standpoint right now. i honestly dont think that its goin to get better b/t us. but.. only time will tell i guess.

one of my old friends died in iraq. well, katties ex boyfriend. he died along with a few other people from this area. he was in the truck that ran into the bomb. shes really really upset. she never got over him. he was married and his wife and his family are having a big fight on how they are goin to burry him.. she wants to cremate him and keep him in her room and they want to give him a grave. and nikki doesnt want to have a preist at the funeral because she doesnt have a religion and they want to. i hope they figure everything out........ but i think that it should be what luke would want.

me and kattie were sittin at books earlier and we were talkin about her job or sumin and she said that she didnt like it.. well this guy (he was really cute too..lol) comes and intrduces himself..(kirby.. and i forgot his friends name) and started talkin to us about a job that hes xpanding in this area.. something to do with financial stuff, helping people with their money, and he tells us that part-time we could make 800-3000 dollars a month only workin 8-10 hours a week, plus like 500 dollars in commission.. so me and kattie are goin to and interveiw on thursday in metarie. 

other than this.. my day has been pretty boring.

"event","ive realized that in my whole life.. me and my family have NEVER gotten along. and ya know how some people say ""when you get older things will get better"" well the fuckin lied. things dont get better no matter how hard i try bein nice to them or takin what they say and things they do in the ass.. and not sayin anything.. it sux. i dont really have any friends either. (this is not anything to get pitty from people.. juz how i feel) like noone i can really really talk to about how i feel and not bein worried about if i say something wrong. i juz feel so alone. 
 things are goin horribly wrong b/t me and drake right now.. and its all my fault. i wish sometimes that i could go back in time and change things that i did in our relationship. i realized that im a jealous person. like of him goin hang out with his friends and stuff. like i feel like such a bitch. i get mad at him when he wants to be with his friens. i thinks its because hes the only person that ever understood me and was there for me.. and im scared that hell get taken from me. i dont think that i can be with out him. its not that im dependant on him its juz that he makes me happy and he knows what ive been through.. with my family and all.. and i dont know. i juz know that i need to get on track and do things differently with him or hes really goin to leave me. but im gonna take some advice from a very special person ""sometimes you need a break to get things better"" or she said sumin to that effect. thanks emmy.. u helped me alot. 

  i started a new job last week, at a daycare center. its awesome. i love kids. i work in the 3&4 year olds. its amazing... they are so cute. they have this kids, drake, one day last week we took them outside to play and he was running with a stick and one of the other teachers told him to give it to her and he cracked it in half and threw it in his face and stuck his toung out and took off running. hes 3.. bad bad bad. lol they have this other kid, christian .. hes my favorite.. he acts like hes from another planet.. hell be sittin at the table doing an art project and juz scream for no reason. its cute. anyways.. besides the fact that i love kids.. its a full time job. 8-8 1/2 hours a day.. 5 days a week. right now im only at min wadge.. but in 3 months itll go up. so im good.. and i still work at bath and body works.. thats a lil girly for me.. but its kool. 

  well it late and i guess im tired.. so ill go lay down and stare at the ceiling til i fall asleep. 
 

         love

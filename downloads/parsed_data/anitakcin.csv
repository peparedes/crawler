"event","Whoa....way too much is going on right now.. I'm emoitionally and physically exhausted right now. Lets see.... on Tuesday my greatest grandma of all time passed away and that kinda got my a bit depressed..I'll just have to take her place of the pimp..poor Ray and Jim (""the two"") of whom she was dating..And that same week I was assigned this hella gay paper to do on a book I've already read when I was like a sophmore. There's nothing to write about unless you know politics(and I don't so well...)So ahem,.....Anyways..more depressing shyt..Supposedly ***** (to all of my friends you can guess the name if you read this, I'm tired of typing it) dosen't live at home anymore, so there's no possible way I can ever get back in contact with *****...I'm tired of being a yo-yo... I don't want to get all depressed over this again...fuck it I'll just find a new fn-( fa sho april..) Actucally it really isn't that easy, and I'm glad because I don't want it to be. If finding someone that special would be so easy then it just wouldn't be special...

Speaking of special people...you will never guess who came back (yes- from those four states away) to visit her family and friends!! Thats right - Erin (Toe)!!!!!!
By the way Erin...if you ever do that again...your dead...(you know I'm just kidding, I just like saying that..) Neways, it was the greatest surprise I have ever gotten! Thanks for being my best friend Erin! Life wouldn't be life without you in it! Ahh!...It was so great having us girls together again!

I take that back, I can now go to 18 and over clubs...if only I'd have more friends who are 18 (besides terry and Davina! hehe). Hopefully Davina and some of her friends can go with me soon... that 17 and under club in Sunnyvale is getting old..Hurry up Toe, turn 18 already lol-jkjk(but really hurry up man..). love ya all, thanks Melissa for the baloons and beautiful flowers, as well as Britt for those really cool colorful flowers and April for those yummy chocolates.

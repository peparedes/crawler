so yesterday night after i got home from the movie with whitney (sisterhood of the traveling pants- bestest movie ever), i wrote a long post and it was really good, and it conveyed my feelings about my life at that exact moment. then i lost connection to the internet. soooo basically, i was angry and didn't feel like retyping all it, so i just made a little post, BUT as you can see by looking at the post below this one, that one didn't work either. obviously this computer was freaking out a little last night....lol

i have to go get ready for my day and hopefully i'll have a few minutes to read (i'm like obsessed with this book right now...it's called Soul Searching, so go check that out lol). and i saw that gas is going down, so i'm excited about that. buiey is getting sorta empty. :-D

sunday is the jon concert and it's gonna be sweet, b/c jon's back in ohio. oh, also, sunday is father's day. happy father's day to all you father's out there

? idk.

must go now. :-)

i have a headache, ouch, oh annnnnd i hit my elbow really hard today...it hurts too. lol 

i can't understand how the reddicks have been so strong, execpt that i know they are trusting/have been trusting God through EvErYtHiNg. what more of an example of Real Christians do we need?

rossford starts school on wednesday. wow. 

tomorrow is my last day babysitting. even if i didn't babysit this summer, i would have still been able to pay for driving class. i worked for my mom's business (computer stuff) and made some money. hahah but still i wouldn't have been able to pay for JAM or West Virgina, so i guess it's worth it, considering i don't really have to take care of him too much.


ok well that's enough updating for me. goodbye!

   ok west virginia- well we did some painting on the community center and the boys fixing the roof. it was super steep up there. then the had a vbs and the kids came like this to the vbs everyday- 2 or 3 the first day, 8 or so the next day, then about 12, then around 18!!! super awesome. AR, Maime, and that little girl that said ChaChaCha all the time and dakota and awww i miss them. they are super happy, and they are really quite poor. the town of Widen, where we worked had a population of about 100-120 i think...it was really little tho!!!! it mainly only had about 2 main roads...crazy! ok back to what we did- then we painted this older ladies house, where there were 3 bats living the chimminy. some groups put up a fence, and chopped lumber, and when to this other house to clean it and try to paint the outside. our group on the last day started to finish-up the enclosed porch on a house. also a group worked at the church we went to- Antioch. the finished the back steps, did yard work, and w/e holly told them to do. lol all of the ppl i think liked having us there. and the kids were sooo super sweet to us. the times driving to and from widen in the vans- well, all i have to say is- girl talk!! lol zak and tim cracked us up. down time back at the school where we stayed was really awesome b/c we just hung out and we had some crazy late nights getting yelled at for talking and moving around and that flashlight with the shadows on the wall were funny. i really seriously hope we can go back. i saw God's love in everyone in Widen, people in our group, and i saw people really grow to understand God's love.  
    then after we got back- steph and mere's house-
well on sunday i was too tired and lazy to go to church. :-( big-old-slacker...yes i know. then i went to meredith's house to hang out with her and stephanie. mere was sleeping and me and steph went to TB. then we went to steph's house and we went to andrea scezne's house (idk how to spell it) (who lives down the street) and we went back to steph's house, mere fell asleep, so me n steph ate some potato soup, talked in the van in the garage on the cell phone. took a walk and i saw a shooting star. steph- everything that we talked about in the van- not on the phone but afterwards- it all makes sence- i'm gonna definately wait!!!! b/c you're right, i wouldn't get anything out of it. i'm gonna show my family what God wants in my life. oh- and i don't like ya know.... atleast not like a bf. you remember who he said he likes? well she likes him too, except, they don't know that the other one likes them!! ahh!! hook up!! aww mere and steph- i love you ladies super much! we have some good talks ladies (remember my ""guys"" ""ladies"" sexist to say guys, so now it's ladies thing? lol) emily pinkelman- :-* we had some sweeeeeeet times at DQ (well and you other ladies too) and some nice little talks. love you hun. 
   i can't wait until i can hang out with all you ladies who i haven't seen in fOrEvEr!! liv, jessie, emily mc, blah, blah, you know who you are. lol ok i'm supposed to be babysitting, but he's at jacob's. i didn't go to cheerleading yesterday b/c i spent the night at steph's with mere on sunday, so i better go the rest of the week! oooh yeah and then yesterday i went to kate's and phil came over and we went for a walk and saw emily broeg and kent. then we ate cereal. lol nice nice nice!! ok i love kate sooo super much too!!

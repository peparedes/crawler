More medals to give to Pepper for the glass case being installed in the mansion. The thanks of a grateful nation that was awesome and flattering but nothing when compared to the seventeen funerals he&rsquo;d attended in the last two weeks.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The memorial garden was almost empty now, delicate posies of flowers cuddled against the clear, stone plaques. Immature roses with hopeful blooms would become a brilliant cascade in a few years, shading the small garden and the memories placed within. On the north side of the area the earth was still bare, the final border hedging in place for the ceremony but only just.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Adjusting his sunglasses, Tony dropped his jacket onto a stone bench and wandered out of the garden to a couple of picnickers under an oak tree.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Can I give you five dollars for that bottle of water?&rdquo; He asked, glad he now carried some cash for the occasional small purchase of hot dogs and the like.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What? Five dollars? Are you&hellip;? Oh man Tony Stark!&rdquo; The guy took on a pole-axed expression that meant Tony was going to be signing something very soon. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sure you can Honey, here.&rdquo; The woman set down a squirming baby onto the blanket and tossed Tony one of the bottles from a cooler. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it.&rdquo; She waved off Tony&rsquo;s money. &ldquo;Least we can do to say thanks, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony smiled his own thanks and mentally promised to send Thor over later with Mjolnir just to make her husband&rsquo;s brain explode from fannish joy.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Back in the memorial garden, Tony headed towards to the north border. Twisting the cap off the bottle, he offered the water to Cap as he crouched over a small seedling. The great shield was sitting just so to protect the tiny plant from the blazing midday sun, Steve&rsquo;s hair glowing and literally getting lighter as Tony watched.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thank you, Sweetheart.&rdquo; Steve emptied half the bottle onto the determined little green shoot, waiting as the dry earth swallowed the fluid before offering the rest.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony rolled his eyes at the endearment, but he managed to restrain himself from complaining. To Steve, Tony was his sweetheart, his baby and his darling and as long as he never called him any of those names in front of an enemy or a congressman Tony was okay with that.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Could you actually be anymore saintly?&rdquo; He asked with affection. &ldquo;I mean, savior of innocents and small children all well and good, but plants as well? Are the Avengers going into eco-management now?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap tilted his head to the side thoughtfully. &ldquo;We should, but I think we&rsquo;re a bit busy for that don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Some of us are,&rdquo; Tony countered. &ldquo;Some of us just punch bad guys and lay around drawing obscene pictures all day.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Like you hate being my model.&rdquo; Steve chuckled before standing up, a living flag with a pleading smile. &ldquo;Do you think you could maybe put something together so that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony looked to the bright blue heavens. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll make a sunshade for your little flower Cap.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thanks Sweetheart.&rdquo; And then Steve was descending on him, all big hands and dangerous lips and they couldn&rsquo;t make out in the memorial garden except they were. After a minute Tony broke away. &ldquo;You have a couple of Generals and Senators wanting to shake your hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ll be back soon, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; Steve looked at the seventeen neatly arranged plaques. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be faster next time.&rdquo; Tony promised, because he was working on a new notification system with Jarvis that could scan any incoming 911 calls. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We will.&rdquo; Steve agreed before guiding Tony back towards the throng awaiting them.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The end.</span></p><br /></lj-cut>"

Tony decided the exquisitely deadly woman might even be capable of maiming a man with an hors d&rsquo;oeuvre if the rest of the team didn&rsquo;t stop hovering quite so worriedly over her couch-bound figure. A punctured lung filled with blood was the final result of the battle with the crazy cult people and they were lucky, in a way, that Natasha&rsquo;s had been the only critical injury.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Thirty-six hours later and the Avengers were finally back in the mansion. Washed, rested and bandaged, Nick Fury had given them all an almost-smile before returning to his usual glare. Thor had contrived with Jarvis to arrange a small party in order to celebrate Natasha&rsquo;s not death and the saving of twenty-three civilians hijacked from an interstate bus four days prior to the attack on Central Park.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony smiled down at the untouched beer in his hand, listening as Thor tried to intervene on Clint&rsquo;s behalf with Natasha while Bruce explained deoxyribonucleic acid to Cap. Pepper walked into the room talking to Coulson, something about a press conference in three days and needing flight schedules. Jarvis silently handed them both drinks and plates of food before moving over to rescue the canap&eacute; being crushed in Natasha&rsquo;s delicate fingers.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve was frowning at Bruce in concentration. It wasn&rsquo;t the science that was giving him trouble, but the modern terms of reference the doctor was using. The nuclear physicist, like several of the most brilliant people in their fields, was having trouble looking at an idea from the outside. It was a credit to Cap that he was absorbing half the thoughts Bruce was enthusiastically talking about. Tony only understood about one word in three on his best days.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It was the small frown that did it. Those two little creases somehow pushed Tony over an emotional hurdle, allowing him a glimpse into something that might have been peace. Seeing these people, seeing his <i>friends</i> so alive, so ready to help when needed was like a shiny little epiphany the color of the arc reactor. Tony felt a tension in his chest unknot. Strands of hurt unraveling, slipping away like watered silk, leaving him with an open, empty space aching to be filled. Taking a deep, lung expanding breath, Tony drew in the belonging and affection in the room and smiled.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It felt like giving up or giving in. A battle Tony hadn&rsquo;t even known he was fighting was ending with that smile. He let go and allowed himself an indulgence of joy he&rsquo;d not dared touch since Afghanistan.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">God, he was in love with Steve.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The man so perfectly made in his soul he endured having his body remade to match. A wry sense of humor mingled with passionate intensity in combat. An off-key boisterous laugh that brought out the silver in clear blue eyes and quick graceful hands that ran charcoal over paper with greater accuracy than the spinning of his shield.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony knew he wasn&rsquo;t the first and most definitely not the last person to fall in love with Captain America. But the idea of reciprocation didn&rsquo;t really factor in to this revelation. The broken, damaged thing in his chest was capable of love like this. Pepper with her little glass box and her deep abiding friendship had started Tony on a road that ended here.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He loved Steve Rogers.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">And it was all in his smile.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap glanced in his direction at that precise moment, fingers raised to scratch idly at his shoulder, mouth open to ask Bruce a question.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony didn&rsquo;t bother to hide his expression. It was too late anyway, Steve had frozen with a stunned look the moment their eyes met and without a word to Bruce broke away from the corner and crossed the room. A small kernel of panic turned in Tony&rsquo;s stomach at the intent look on Cap&rsquo;s face. There was no answering smile, no enquiring eyebrow or rolled eyes, just a dozen steps and Tony&rsquo;s view of the room blocked by broad shoulders and hair that glinted golden in the light.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A little desperately, Tony steadied his stance and raised his own brows flirtatiously. &ldquo;So, if you&rsquo;re free on Friday&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The rest of Tony&rsquo;s question was cut off as Steve pushed one hand into Tony&rsquo;s hair; the other fisted in his four thousand dollar shirt and pulled him into a searing kiss. The sound of Tony&rsquo;s beer bottle thumping to the floor was the only noise in the paralyzing silence of the room.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Hands free, Tony caught at the back of Steve&rsquo;s neck and waist for balance as he was almost lifted off his feet. Steve&rsquo;s mouth tasted like beer, his tongue curling and pressing against Tony&rsquo;s while he pulled them close enough to almost occupy the same space. It was wicked and delicious with Tony hanging on for dear life and praying to any god that would listen that Steve meant this and hadn&rsquo;t simply lost his mind.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He was released for a split second to catch some air, then as his surprisingly dominant Captain bent back to the task of obliterating Tony&rsquo;s brain he dimly heard Clint say, &ldquo;Banner, what do you mean you had no idea? Even I knew and my gay-dar was declared broken years ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Shut up, Clint.&rdquo; Natasha said, her voice filled with unmistakable glee. &ldquo;Tony, for god&rsquo;s sake! Get a room.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony would have pointed out that <i>he</i> was hardly the one making the decisions in this embrace, but since he was being kissed and pawed by Captain America he was actually incapable of thought, let alone speech. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve pulled back fractionally, one hand between Tony&rsquo;s shoulder blades, the other indisputably on his ass.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; he said, their mouths millimeters apart, before walking Tony backwards into the hallway. A momentary pause at the kitchen door for an astonished Tony to see Jarvis happily hand-wave them on and then he was stumbling slightly into the master bedroom.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Did you just get Jarvis&rsquo; permission to&hellip;&rdquo; Tony managed to begin.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sure did.&rdquo; Steve confirmed kicking the door closed.</span><br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut>"

Romonoff must have had a conversation with Coulson because she and Tony had removed several terrorist cells through the Middle East with no argument whatsoever from her superiors. He figured it was a concession to Tony&rsquo;s mood after he almost indirectly destroyed the UN, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to bother to ask. He&rsquo;d built Iron Man to fix the mistakes he&rsquo;d made with Stark Industries, the Avengers were all about threats that none of them could handle alone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">They could manage just fine without him. Particularly if Fury could get Rhodey on board as a full time member. Then they&rsquo;d have Iron Man&rsquo;s flight and defenses with about ten times the damage per second. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Only thing was, Tony really loved being one of the good guys.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Back in the New York mansion after a couple of days in LA doing business, Tony was joined by Thor on the garden stairs while he watched Hawkeye&rsquo;s target practice and inhaled some coffee. After forty-five shots the man hadn&rsquo;t missed one bull&rsquo;s eye.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d get bored.&rdquo; Tony observed as Thor leaned his back against an ornamental urn, long legs sprawling down the wide marble stairs.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It is only through repetition and practice that a warrior can maintain the highest level of his skills.&rdquo; Thor pronounced with a hint of sanction in his tone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony shot him an amused glance. &ldquo;I thought you Viking gods were all about the feasting and the mead?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Only after the battle is won,&rdquo; but there was matching humor in the god&rsquo;s voice now. &ldquo;Then we are all about the mead.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I knew you weren&rsquo;t as holier than thou as you pretend to be Big Man. We should try some of my mead in the cellar sometime?&rdquo; Tony asked as Clint&rsquo;s arrows obliterated another target.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Perhaps when next we have emerged victorious from a conflict, we shall celebrate as a team?&rdquo; Thor didn&rsquo;t take his eyes off Clint as the archer received a call on the communication bud in his ear.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony couldn&rsquo;t ever be described as na&iuml;ve in any way. &ldquo;Yeah, sure. As a team,&rdquo; he agreed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an army of giants ants raiding people&rsquo;s picnics in Central Park.&rdquo; Clint told them as he walked over, running quick fingers over the arrows in his quiver.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony blinked. &ldquo;Let me guess, they&rsquo;re not running away with sandwiches?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Clint&rsquo;s smile was grim.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Tony spoke while using repulsors to kill the larger warrior ants. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read a paper by this guy who thinks he can identify the level of sound ants talk to each other on.&rdquo; Another insect with a toughened exoskeleton went flying. &ldquo;I thought he was on crack.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap&rsquo;s shield whirled under Tony&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;That would be helpful right now, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; The Avenger&rsquo;s ear bud communications were sketchy at best with the magic auras all over the place.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Hearing what the ants are saying? Um&hellip;unless they&rsquo;re telling each other where the secret location of their queen is, then no.&rdquo; Tony was starting the get a rhythm going with the repulsors. Kind of like old school space invaders, but without the retro-techno music score.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo; Cap&rsquo;s grunt of pain had Tony turning in time to see an ant catapulted across the park to fell several of its comrades. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re flanking us.&rdquo; Cap reported, taking up a back-to-back position with Hawkeye.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Cheeky little fuckers.&rdquo; Tony blasted three away from Widow and tried to use his boot repulsors to drive others off two huddled civilians.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thor?&rdquo; Cap asked the blond Viking out in the center of the insectoid army. Thor was swinging Mjolnir like a baseball bat and having way too much fun in Tony&rsquo;s opinion.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I cannot bring down a storm here Captain.&rdquo; More ants became bowling balls of doom to their own kind. &ldquo;There are too many bystanders still in the battle zone that may be harmed.&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sir&hellip;&rdquo; </span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony&rsquo;s AI began.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Great minds Jarvis. Cap? We don&rsquo;t need lightening; these ants are acting just like animals without higher intelligence. So&hellip;&rdquo; Tony was momentarily interrupted by the impact of an ant bringing him to the ground. Oh shit. He&rsquo;d forgotten that some ants have wings.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Iron Man? Status?&rdquo; Cap grunted through another man vs. insect wrestling match.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Fine. Get off my face, Adam.&rdquo; Tony blasted it halfway back to the mansion. He got to his feet. &ldquo;As I was saying&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Adam?&rdquo; Cap actually spoke that to Tony&rsquo;s faceplate, a slight pause in the ant&rsquo;s momentum giving them a minute to regroup.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony grinned. &ldquo;Be glad you missed the eighties, Cap.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I liked Duran Duran,&rdquo; Black Widow offered with a wry smile, adrenalin rendering her flushed and gorgeous.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Russian. Your musical taste doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; Tony teased.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap took a quick surveying look at his team, except for Thor, whose joy in battle had resulted in singing and thus the temporary paralysis of the ant horde.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thor makes it rain,&rdquo; Tony offered his plan. &ldquo;No lightening, just big fat raindrops, they&rsquo;re ants&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll retreat underground during a rainstorm.&rdquo; Cap finished the thought setting off in Thor&rsquo;s direction.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Unless they&rsquo;re mind controlled by the sorcerer.&rdquo; Clint countered pessimistically. &ldquo;Then we have to fight them in the rain.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony rolled his eyes behind the faceplate. &ldquo;Better idea, Hawkeye. Let&rsquo;s hear it?&rdquo; Rising into the air, he had JARVIS run a scan to identify the possible entries to the ant lair.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Hawkeye renewed his insect target practice. &ldquo;Get the people clear so the lightening can fry the lot of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony gave that a seconds thought. &ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Do both.&rdquo; The Captain ordered, currently keeping a circle clear around Thor while the Norse God summoned the rain. &ldquo;Help the civilians, but be ready to follow if the ants retreat.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo; Iron Man pinpointed the non-combatants and made for the ones farthest from the Avengers.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Admitting I was right isn&rsquo;t going to make you less of a man Hawkeye.&rdquo; Tony told the purple leather back as they trudged down tunnels that didn&rsquo;t exist beneath the park.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The archer barely paused in his determined pursuit of their foe. &ldquo;You had no idea if they were controlled or not, you just guessed.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony shrugged inside the armor. &ldquo;My guess was right.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Cut the chatter fellas, we&rsquo;re there.&rdquo; Cap moved silently back from a ledge just ahead of them. Tony was bringing up the rear of the group because Iron Man was many things, but quiet wasn&rsquo;t one of them. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Looking out into the huge natural cavern, Tony didn&rsquo;t need to switch to infra-red as he&rsquo;d expected. The ant queen was lying on a mound of sand bathed in the light of thirteen halogen lamps. Three human women sat around her, each holding a large earthen bowl in their laps. Even from a distance, Tony could detect the blood staining the women&rsquo;s mouths, clothes and pooling in the sand beneath them.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I hate magic.&rdquo; Tony whispered.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I concur, Sir.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> JARVIS agreed with a verbal shudder.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Send them back! Now!&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s external microphones picked up the harsh, exhausted voice. He reached forward to tap Cap on the shoulder, but was forestalled by the man&rsquo;s sudden tension.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A grey-faced teenage boy in skinny jeans was pushed to his knees in front of the enormous ant queen. The woman who&rsquo;d spoken lifted a red-stained machete.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh, to the hells no.&rdquo; Clint swore viciously.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Iron Man.&rdquo; Captain America leaned back in a perfect discus lunge.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo; Tony said as he shot over their heads and down into the cavern. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It was a race between Cap&rsquo;s shield and Iron Man, but Tony gave his stomach over to mach 2 and pushed his shoulder under the machete strike just in the nick of time. The youth was screaming in terror as Tony lifted him away from the Grand High Murdering Psychobitch, but he clung to Tony&rsquo;s shoulders with desperate, grateful hands.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Back at the exit, Tony set the kid down and took note of the shield back in Captain America&rsquo;s grasp, several witches with arrows in their wrists and ankles and a spider among the ants.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Oh and Thor was singing again. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thank you, thank you man. Jesus fuck, fuck.&rdquo; The teenager scrubbed his hands over his face and looked to Iron Man with crazed eyes. &ldquo;They were killing everyone, one by one, just taking us. Fuck! They killed the driver, cut bits off him and fed them to that queen thing. Jesus.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony agreed with the sentiment, but he didn&rsquo;t have time to give the boy comfort. Thor was hammering the queen, but the coven were regrouping and starting to overwhelm Clint and Natasha with the ant colony.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Central Park is that way. Find the cops or guys that look like Special Forces, tell them we&rsquo;re down here.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t wait to see if the guy complied, he only just managed to kill the ant on Hawkeye&rsquo;s back before it took a bite out of his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Long bloody minutes passed as the Avengers waded through the shifting morass of insects. Iron Man played bait for the witches, taking their weird magical force bolts on his armor and retaliating in spades with repulsor blasts. Thor had churned up a sand storm around the queen, high insect shrieks coming from within. Occupied with the coven Tony couldn&rsquo;t protect his team-mates, he had to rely on the trio to cover each other&rsquo;s backs while he and Thor tried to break the battle wide open.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;The colony should flee in fear or simply fall into disarray if the queen dies.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> JARVIS offered.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;That is the plan.&rdquo; Tony gritted out, ignoring red lights on the HUD, listening desperately to Widow and Hawkeye yelling moves to each other over the here-again, gone-again comms. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Wham! Iron Man went into an uncontrolled back-spin for four long seconds, before he could right himself. Shaking off the vertigo Tony focused on the battle only to be swamped again by the combined magical rage of three very power witches.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Systems at criti&hellip;&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Tony growled, switching over to the Avengers&rsquo; comm-line. &ldquo;Thor, Cap fall back I&rsquo;m going to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Iron Man, <i>you </i>fall back! Thor, distract her, I&rsquo;m coming in from the south side.&rdquo; Steve sounded breathless, but calm in the face of countless enemies. Tony dodged another volley, taking a quick scan of the sand mound. Cap&rsquo;s plan was good. The queen, near incoherent with rage and pain was pursuing the blond giant with the electricity that stung and smoked along her carapace.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Captain America was moving with that uncanny co-ordination through the chaotic churn of the ant colony, stealing closer out of the queen&rsquo;s sight. One perfect strike from the honed edge of the red, white and blue shield would take her out and end the battle.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">But it wouldn&rsquo;t happen if Tony retreated. There were three witches at least out there; one of them would see Steve. He was better than good, he could likely duck the magical missiles that peppered Tony, all Cap needed was one good throw.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Then he would be defenseless until his shield spun back.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony flew a strafing pass over the witches' heads. They turned to follow him, blue death flying from their hands.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Thor dropped to one knee, Mjolnir readied as if for another strike.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;System failure in three&hellip;.two&hellip;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap beheaded the queen in one neat strike.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A great sigh concertinaed through the colony and then the ants began to flee.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">From the small crater he&rsquo;d made on the ground, Tony blinked up at the ceiling and was momentarily pleased he&rsquo;d worn pants underneath the armor today. The ants were running over him, hundreds of legs skidding off his skin, knocking into his shoulders as he curled up to protect his head and chest, instinct and Steve&rsquo;s training coming into play.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Long minutes later the scrambling horde was gone and Tony dropped his arms to a great view of Hawkeye&rsquo;s ass. The archer was standing over him, deflecting the last of the petrified creatures with carefully placed arrows. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Tony got to his feet unsteadily, trying to assess if he could draw out the armor without spraining his spine.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;That was a great plan there Tony, suicide dive for the win yeah?&rdquo; Clint snarked as he took in the bloody scratches along Tony&rsquo;s arms and back.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Bite me,&rdquo; Iron Man smiled as the helmet fitted neatly into place. Thor was subduing the still screaming cult leaders. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Widow?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see her.&rdquo; Worry threaded through the normally cocky tone of Hawkeye&rsquo;s voice.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony grabbed an armful of archer and lifted into the air, quickly spotting the fallen black-clad figure and Captain America steadily performing first aid.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Natasha!&rdquo; The cry was simultaneous. Then Clint was easily dropping to the ground, moving to help while Tony rocketed up the tunnel to find medical aid.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He found it in the form of Agent Coulson, a SHEILD team and several paramedics tentatively moving down the tunnel.</span></p></lj-cut><br />"

Just prior to defusing the main device a third hidden fail safe tripped sending Iron Man careening backwards down eight floors. Given two vital components of his armor were lying on the floor, Tony was actually lucky to survive. Burns on his hands and forearms, nine stitches in his scalp and a nausea inducing concussion that rivaled the most degrading of Tony&rsquo;s hangovers. He hadn&rsquo;t even tried to meet Steve&rsquo;s highly irritated expression when the soldier had climbed into the ambulance, merely let the ice pack pressed to his forehead drip steadily onto the floor.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Using the boot repulsors in a confined space was a something he&rsquo;d have to practice.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Later, sitting on the kitchen island Tony watched Jarvis apply raw aloe sap to the burns on his wrist. It was 6am and he still hadn&rsquo;t slept. The return to the mansion and tending of various injuries having left him too wired to relax. Adamantly refusing a bed at the hospital, Tony had stood under a hot shower and attempted to remove several epidermal layers before being snared by Jarvis, clothed in boxers and forced to have his bandages redressed in the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap had come in ten minutes earlier, equally clean and medicated, poured a cup of coffee and installed himself in a chair at Tony&rsquo;s side. At the moment the coffee cup was likely pressing a red ring into Steve&rsquo;s forehead as he silently slumped, aftershock affecting even a war veteran of several years.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony chanced a caress, his gauzed fingers dancing lightly through damp golden hair.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Jarvis neatly folded the towel on which he&rsquo;d spread the aid kit, before cleaning up the bandage packaging. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all Master Anthony, I shall attend to Doctor Banner and the disaster in the red ballroom.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Of course, Jarvis.&rdquo; Tony acknowledged. As the butler passed him to leave, Tony reached out and drew Jarvis into a quick embrace. The perfect posture relented briefly and Tony was granted a short, warm, hug.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Get some rest lad, I&rsquo;ll see to lunch in a few hours.&rdquo; The hand was gentle between Tony&rsquo;s shoulder-blades.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Tony rubbed his tired eyes on Jarvis&rsquo; shoulder and let the older man go to his bed. Picking at the gauze, he sighed quietly.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Steve began.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;If you tell me it&rsquo;s not my fault I&rsquo;m going to hit you repeatedly with this antiseptic bottle.&rdquo; Tony threatened.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A small furrow occurred below the cup imprint that could only be described as cute. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t actually, but given how defensive<i> that</i> statement was, maybe you could try opening up to someone about your guilt&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Staring at the refrigerator was soothing. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;During the war, America didn&rsquo;t have doctors to help us understand what we were going through like they do now.&rdquo; Steve kept speaking despite Tony&rsquo;s lack of response. &ldquo;Natasha says there&rsquo;s someone at SHEILD&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Again, no.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I have.&rdquo; That brought Tony&rsquo;s head around in surprise. Cap looked up showing Tony troubled blue eyes. &ldquo;These gifts I have, I could take a life so very easily. I&rsquo;ve wanted to.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony thought for long seconds before he spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed a lot of people, both with my weapons and with Iron Man.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; So very calm, not even a hint of judgment.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Me, doing the team thing,&rdquo; Tony waved a hand vaguely at the upper floors of the mansion where Clint, Thor, Natasha and Bruce were unwinding in their own way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really working out, is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it work.&rdquo; Steve promised; eyes on his cooling coffee. &ldquo;We need you.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It was on the tip of Tony&rsquo;s tongue to repeat the flip answer he&rsquo;d given Coulson last year, but he caught himself just in time. Even though they&rsquo;d only known each other for a few months, Tony didn&rsquo;t want to flirt too heavily or he&rsquo;d likely send the man running. They were only just recently friends and despite Tony&rsquo;s libido, no chance in hell of being more than that if he didn&rsquo;t behave himself. But these last few weeks, from that &lsquo;buy me a hot dog&rsquo; not-date in the park and all the shit afterwards, maybe he had a chance after all.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve mightn&rsquo;t be interested in Tony as more than a friend, but he seemed determined to be that much at least. Tony was used to people getting pissed at him, even knew more than a few who wanted to kill him. This whole part of a team where people covered each other&rsquo;s backs and wanted to help? That level of affection was putting Tony way out of his comfort zone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo; For five seconds then say &lsquo;fuck no&rsquo;, but he&rsquo;d give Steve that much.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Of course Cap had spent nearly a year getting to know Tony too. &ldquo;If not a professional then someone else. Maybe James?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It took Tony several long seconds to realize who Cap was talking about. &ldquo;Rhodey? God no. He&rsquo;d tell me to man up and&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Would he really?&rdquo; Steve asked, eyes once again seeing all Tony&rsquo;s bullshit excuses and ignoring them completely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a soldier, he&rsquo;s seen combat, he&rsquo;s had to kill and he&rsquo;s your friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He looked away from that perfect, handsome face and through the window saw the lights come on in the garage.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Maybe Rhodey. &ldquo; He could literally feel Steve&rsquo;s pleased smile. &ldquo;I said <i>maybe </i>you pusher. No chance of sleeping now, I&rsquo;m gonna see how badly I fucked up my armor.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Sliding off the island, Tony bumped his hip against one khaki shoulder and went in search of clothes.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span><br /><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""><br />It took Tony less than a week to repair the damage. Although the explosion had been brutal to his skin, the armor itself had emerged with relatively minor damage. Nevertheless the entire suit needed to be checked over, small repairs made and the finish re-done before Tony would even think about re-absorbing it.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">AI Jarvis took on a distinctly fussy tone, pointing out all the minor scratches and dents that probably could pass, but the system wouldn&rsquo;t even boot up until everything was perfect.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;The original suit absorbed by the ICC software was flawless, Sir. We have no parameters to determine if even the slightest discrepancy between armor conditions will have an impact. I would not recommend allowing even minimally damaged plating to be stored in your bones at this time.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> JARVIS was adamant.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Bitch, bitch, bitch.&rdquo; Tony teased as he buffered the last weld out of the shin plate.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Steve agreed from where he was buried head-first in the SS Jaguar&rsquo;s engine block.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony glanced up and was momentarily paralyzed by the upturned excellence of Cap&rsquo;s denim clad ass. He was going to buy Pepper some ridiculously expensive shoes in thanks for overhauling Steve&rsquo;s &lsquo;YES I&rsquo;M IN THE ARMY&rsquo; wardrobe. Those jeans were very, very distracting.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to invite me to the wedding you two are having,&rdquo; Tony sniped, because yeah, a nice ass didn&rsquo;t mean he needed another mother-hen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be tough to be best man twice, but I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A heaving sigh from the Jag. </span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Why I would be honored, Sir. The Captain is a fine catch.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> Tony sometimes forgot he designed JARVIS&rsquo; sense of humor too.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Rewriting your code,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. &ldquo;Are we done then? Can I do this or do we need another fifteen million sims to make sure I don&rsquo;t spontaneously combust?&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Everything is operating within acceptable parameters, Sir.&rdquo; </span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Hallelujah.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap turned from the vintage car, wiping clean hands on an equally clean rag. Tony&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he kicked off his boots and took his place on the armor assembly platform.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What exactly are you doing in my car?&rdquo; He asked as JARVIS commanded the robotic arms to turn him into Iron Man.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve shrugged. &ldquo;Nothing really.&rdquo; He tossed the rag onto a work bench. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know all that much about cars.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The helmet locked into place around Tony&rsquo;s stunned expression. &ldquo;Are you shitting me&hellip;?&rdquo; But he was cut off as the HUD came online and JARVIS began running simulations.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Always with the simulations.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Three days you&rsquo;ve been poking around my garage.&rdquo; Tony was actually feeling angry now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need another fucking babysitter.&rdquo; He imagined his voice had the harsh mechanical edge it got when fed through Iron Man&rsquo;s speakers.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo; Steve was unfazed. Watching Tony put the armor through the motions before returning to the platform. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Then why hang around?&rdquo; Jarvis gave him the all clear. Tony took a deep breath and forced himself to relax.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s do this,&rsquo; he thought.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Just like before, there was no pain, only the vague sense of something pushing at his shoulders and sides. Then his center of balance was all screwy and Tony was catching himself on a nearby assembly arm rather than fall to the ground.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; Steve answered his question, blue eyes bright with admiration for Tony&rsquo;s ability to integrate the armor.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You have successfully absorbed the armor through the nodes into your skeletal structure, Sir.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> JARVIS reported. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">As if the lack of Iron Man around Tony could mean anything else.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You are now 25 pounds heavier.&rdquo; </span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony hadn&rsquo;t looked away from Steve. &ldquo;Give a girl a complex why don&rsquo;t you Jarvis?&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Your girlish figure has remained the same as always, Sir. I merely&hellip;&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;See you for training tomorrow.&rdquo; Cap said before heading towards the door.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh fantastic. I&rsquo;ll be early.&rdquo; The sarcasm was met with a casual wave and a closed door.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">JARVIS was unusually silent.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; Tony snarled before pulling the armor back out.</span></p></lj-cut>"

Tony smiled, sipped soda water, avoided questions about his facial art and bought Jarvis a pretty little eighteenth century end table that he&rsquo;d seen the man looking at online. The real fun began a week later in Ecuador when he conducted a surprise visit of a Stark Industries factory to answer some nasty questions about working conditions.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The factory had passed international standards&hellip;just. Tony wasn&rsquo;t in the business of skimming a pass mark, his corporation had some of the best trade practices in the world and the conditions would be superlative by the end of the month. Or else. Turning away from a somewhat heated discussion with his South American head of operations, Tony called Pepper to tell her he&rsquo;d handled it and was then shot four times in the back. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">In the chaos the shots caused, Tony genuinely thought someone else had been the target. He&rsquo;d located Delven through the HUD as his bodyguard tackled the gunwoman to the floor; his other guards took up flanking positions around Tony, while his executives made for cover under the table or sat stunned in their chairs. It wasn&rsquo;t until he got a clear view of the woman, a board member, and the HUD gave him her name and employment history that Tony became aware he was wearing Iron Man.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Genuinely under threat.&rdquo; He observed, looking at the repulsor gauntlets. They seemed the same as always, no indication that the elements had been stored in his bones for the last nine days. &ldquo;Very cool.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Delven was only vaguely flustered by the attempted murder of his charge. Considering the bullets would likely have killed him, placed centre mass like all the military in the world are taught, Tony figured the man might be happy his client was a superhero after all.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Tony assured him, because Delven without his stoic expression was beginning to freak him out. &ldquo;Did that look sci-fi enough for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Strange as all hell, Mr. Stark. Like you were sweating metal,&rdquo; Delven replaced the sunglasses that had been knocked asquew buy his exertions. &ldquo;But I work for SHEILD, I&rsquo;ve seen crazier than that.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo; Tony said.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">When nearly fifty individuals with personal body armor and guns enough to rival War Machine attacked the United Nations complex, the Avengers weren&rsquo;t the first call that was made. Apparently, domestic terrorism was still under the purview of the U.S. Government and thus not part of their superhero responsibilities.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re just going to watch people die on CNN?&rdquo; Clint demanded harshly. His staring match with Coulson had gone from brief to uncomfortably long several seconds ago. Bruce simply sat watching the mansion&rsquo;s massive LCD screen, hands still, expression calculating.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;The local authorities are managing the situation.&rdquo; Coulson replied, not even remotely phased by Clint&rsquo;s passion.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony had just returned from an engineering consult in Egypt and wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to fuck around.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo; He slipped off his jacket because, even for Tony, it was hard to lose a $17,000 suit every time he pulled out the armor.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; Coulson didn&rsquo;t break eye-contact with Hawkeye.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony laughed. &ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t stop me.&rdquo; Tie and shoes hit the Versace sofa. &ldquo;This is the sort of bullshit I was all over long before Fury gave me the recruitment speech.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an Avenger now,&rdquo; Coulson obviously deemed Tony&rsquo;s striptease a more worrisome thing than getting one over on Clint. &ldquo;SHEILD&rsquo;s mandate is to intervene only in situations&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So, I quit.&rdquo; Because six months was a good run for Tony. He&rsquo;d never committed to any club for that long before.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Declined.&rdquo; Cap said as he and Natasha came into the room, a StarkTech tablet in the other agent&rsquo;s hands. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re using non-standard electromagnetic weapons, likely sourced from China.&rdquo; Natasha passed the device to Coulson. &ldquo;The LEOs won&rsquo;t be able to stop that kind of firepower. People will die.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Natasha&rsquo;s face gave no inclination of care one way or another. Coulson scanned the tablet while Cap slowly raised an eyebrow at Tony&rsquo;s half-dressed state.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Very well. You are cleared to go.&rdquo; The senior agent allowed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Still quitting.&rdquo; Tony declared as he surrounded himself with Iron Man.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; Captain America put on his game face and led the Avengers into the field.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The United Nations was a sprawling complex currently being evacuated by super-efficient security staff. They were a little distracted by the armed gunmen and women currently taking over several of their buildings, but no one was panicking yet.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this.&rdquo; Rhodey always sounded different via War Machine&rsquo;s comm. channel. Calm and measured like they weren&rsquo;t trudging the Secretariat room by room looking for terrorists and civilians, hopefully not in the same place. Tony knew Col. Rhodes&rsquo; eerie Zen was like Cap&rsquo;s command voice, but it still sounded weird. He had to stop making friends with all these military types.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because search and rescue isn&rsquo;t part of your &lsquo;badass&rsquo; persona right?&rdquo; Tony was five floors down from the roof, looking through offices while the other Avengers were scattered in various hot spots. Rhodey had been ordered in after a fierce shouting match between the military and the UN security force.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I mean, this seems like we&rsquo;re dealing with clone troopers or something. Where did they get all those armaments?&rdquo; He heard the background noise as War Machine slammed open a door, petrifying a few cowering diplomats before shepherding them to an exit.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You know as well as I do&hellip;&rdquo; Tony stopped as Hawkeye and Thor&rsquo;s line went live with gunfire and swearing.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Where are they Jarvis?&rdquo;<i> </i>Tony called up schematics of every building, every room.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Second floor General Assembly, Sir.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> Tony moved across to a window.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found a bomb.&rdquo; Captain America reported. &ldquo;Eighth floor Secretariat stairwell.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to destroy most of the block.&rdquo; Widow concurred, accent slipping faintly into Russian with her tension. &ldquo;Iron Man?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Tony said, backtracking towards the stairwell.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Stark Industries.&rdquo; There wasn&rsquo;t even a trace of emotion in Natasha&rsquo;s voice now.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony swallowed. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t touch it.&rdquo;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The Iron Man blasted through the stairwell door.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">His gauntlets and helmet on the floor, Tony used Natasha&rsquo;s multi-tool to strip wires and turn minute screws.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Widow, get to Hawkeye&rsquo;s position to help with those gunmen.&rdquo; Cap ordered lifting away the last of the cement wall he&rsquo;d just smashed into pieces to give Tony full access to the monster in the air duct.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo; Natasha took the steps three at a time.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Nimble little minx isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Tony carefully dismantled the casing around the mini-bomb that was supposed to kill him while he defused the device that was supposed to kill thousands.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap carefully took hold of the plastic explosive Tony passed him. &ldquo;I know she&rsquo;d cause extensive bruises if you say that in range of her hearing.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;They have hostages.&rdquo; Thor reported voice heavy with disgust at such cowardly tactics.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony looked into worried azure eyes. &ldquo;Go.

Yes Captain, I am.&rdquo; Steve didn&rsquo;t deserve the sharp edge of Tony&rsquo;s tongue, but stressed didn&rsquo;t even begin to cover what he was feeling at that moment.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blow yourself up.&rdquo; With that Cap was gone, sprinting down stairs with inhuman speed. Tony looked back at the mass murder in his hands. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Alright bitch, let&rsquo;s do this.</span><br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Chapter 7""><p><b><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Chapter 7</span></b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Captain America had a not unreasonable desire to make sure the Avengers team was battle ready. Due to each individual being formidable in their own right, they tended to work to their own strengths in combat, leading to more than one error. Case in point, Clint and Thor&rsquo;s minor fuck up with the spiders meant that Tony was playing chicken with Cap&rsquo;s shield on his back lawn instead of designing new armor in the garage.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Two teams, Tony and Clint versus Natasha and Thor with Cap running interference on both sides trying to shake everyone up a little. Bruce recording the session for later review had Tony acting up for the camera. While no-one was trying to cause hurt, Tony could kill Natasha with frightening ease after all; they were doing their damndest to bring the other side down. Unfortunately Thor took one too many concussion hits from Hawkeye and brought lightening down on the whole garden. Tony, being a show off, decided to fly a slalom course through the electrical forest rather than take cover like everyone else.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He got one sharp, devastating jolt. For two point four seconds JARVIS was offline and Iron Man was tumbling towards the mansion out of control. As soon as he had power Tony frantically tried to stabilize his momentum with boot and hand repulsors. It wasn&rsquo;t working.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He was going to hit Bruce. Hard.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It happened between one breath and the next. One moment the HUD was there, red frames skittering alarmingly across his vision and then cool air rushed over Tony&rsquo;s skin. His hair blew into his eyes for a split second before he crashed hard into the turned shoulder of his teammate.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Ooof!&rdquo; With a bone-crunching thump they went down, Bruce beneath Tony in an ungainly sprawl.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Sitting up gingerly, Tony heard the other Avengers running across the lawn towards them. &ldquo;Hey Handsome.&rdquo; He smiled down at the man he was straddling in nothing but tight boxer-briefs.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Bruce rolled his eyes and fingered a small cut on the bridge of his nose. &ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s Betty and she's way prettier than you. Get off me!&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Chuckling Tony had just began to comply when he was bodily lifted up to meet Captain America&rsquo;s displeased expression.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What on earth&hellip;&rdquo; he began furiously, hands on Tony&rsquo;s bare shoulders.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh come!&rdquo; Tony interrupted. &ldquo;I instinctively dropped the armor before I hit him. No Iron Man torpedoes against innocent civilians. How is this not good?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve took a deep breath. &ldquo;What on earth happened to your armor?&rdquo; He repeated with slightly less intensity.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It dismantled into seventeen components&hellip;&rdquo; Tony explained, trying not to treat Cap like an imbecile.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh really Genius?&rdquo; Clint snared Tony&rsquo;s arm in an almost painful grip and tugged him around Cap. &ldquo;Where is it then?&rdquo; The view back along Iron Man&rsquo;s course was clear of any red and gold plate shaped pieces. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony frowned. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;From where I was yelling and running it looked like the armor just melted into you.&rdquo; Clint explained.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; Looking closely at the contact node on his forearm, Tony saw it gleamed a brilliant shade of gold.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;The <i>thing</i> on your face is different.&rdquo; Strong fingers caught the back of Tony&rsquo;s head, turning his face to Steve. The anger was gone, now only worry caused the tight mouth and furrowed brow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s red and gold, like the armor. Tony, what happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Tony took the hit to his pride and answered truthfully. He would love to come up with a way of wiping out that worry but, surprisingly, he didn&rsquo;t think he was capable of lying to Steve. The ICC was an experiment in progress, they&rsquo;d thought it had run its course but obviously that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Bruce offered Tony his jacket and pointed towards the garage. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go run some tests.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It was an indication of Tony&rsquo;s state of mind that he followed Bruce without a word of protest, gaze on his arm, mind churning with possibilities.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">****</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sir, the MRI results indicate you have approximately 25 pounds of a metallic substance located within your skeleton. How the marrow remains and why you aren&rsquo;t deceased is still a mystery.&rdquo; </span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">While JARVIS rarely sounded worried, there was occasionally a faint trace of concern in the perfectly modulated voice. Like now.<br /></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Weird.&rdquo; Bruce offered with arms folded as he looked at the results of Tony&rsquo;s scan.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Says you.&rdquo; Tony studied the node on back of his wrist. He pushed a fingernail onto the small golden disk, pressing harder when he felt no sensation. Smooth and flawless, the node was seamlessly blended into his skin, with no discernable edge or ridge. They had supposed that the nodes were connected to the armor, allowing it to bond completely with Tony&rsquo;s skin, improving reaction time tenfold. &ldquo;The man who quadruples his mass and changes the melanin content of his skin has no business calling anyone else weird.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Smiling ruefully, Bruce tapped the screen to change the medical scan view of Tony&rsquo;s form. &ldquo;Your armor was broken down to component elements, compressed and then absorbed through the nodes into your skeleton. It must have responded to your desire to have it disappear before impact. Thanks by the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;For the lack of broken Bruce or the lap dance?&rdquo; Tony smirked, trying to push the node and the skin around it up onto his hand.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Bruce tapped Tony&rsquo;s fingers with a pen. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll irritate the skin. The nodes have created small tubular conduits to your bones, if you damage them we&rsquo;ll never get the armor out again. Catching you wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> much fun by the way.&rdquo; A gesture at the tiny plaster on Bruce&rsquo;s nose.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Hmmm. The question is <i>can </i>we get it back out?&rdquo; Tony asked because the Mark VI was his finest creation yet and the plans for the Mark VII weren&rsquo;t even finished. He&rsquo;d been too busy helping save the New York from the Cult of the Bug.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It would seem that you must simply will it to be so, Sir.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> JARVIS chimed in thoughtfully. <i>&ldquo;The ICC system was designed to incorporate weapons into a human being. It would serve no purpose to lodge the armor in your skeleton without the means of retrieving it.&rdquo; </i></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony looked to the desk where JARVIS&rsquo; voice issued from the speakers. &ldquo;That is an excellent point. I&rsquo;m going to retool this garage as a summer home for you I promise.&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thank you Sir, I&rsquo;ll be sure to have my eBay details altered accordingly.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Shrugging off Bruce&rsquo;s jacket, Tony stared for long seconds at the nodes on his hands. &ldquo;I got nothing.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your armor,&rdquo; Bruce pointed out. &ldquo;Maybe you need to be under threat to bring it out?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Tony pulled the jacket back on. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how many hands I get.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Brow furrowed in confusion Bruce followed him back to the mansion.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Who wants to punch me?&rdquo; Tony asked the team as they loitered around the dining room waiting for dinner.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He didn&rsquo;t know if he should be flattered that Thor reached out to catch Clint&rsquo;s shoulder or not. Steve&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he glanced at Tony&rsquo;s still mostly naked form. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get it out?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Not just by wishing. Bruce thinks I need to be under threat,&rdquo; a careless wave at the doctor behind him. &ldquo;So someone gets to punch me.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No-one here will seriously hurt you,&rdquo; Natasha spoke as she carefully lifted ridiculously healthy food onto her plate. &ldquo;If you have to be genuinely under attack, it&rsquo;ll need to be on the next mission.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I genuinely want to punch him.&rdquo; Clint promised hopefully.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony ignored him. &ldquo;Let me know when the next call comes in or we could just go have a picnic in the park again,&rdquo; he grinned at Steve.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Baby blue eyes went from concerned to furious in under a second.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Not funny Tony.&rdquo; Steve snarled as he spun on his heel and walked out of the room.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Awkward was a massive understatement for the silence that followed his exit.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Idiot.&rdquo; Natasha said under her breath.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna get dressed.&rdquo; Tony told them before making his way to his suite.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">While hardly Tony&rsquo;s worst verbal faux pas, it was likely the most self-destructive when attempting to forge a friendship with someone. He hadn&rsquo;t even bothered to consider Steve&rsquo;s feelings on his kidnapping, so lost in the ICC and the changes wrought on his body. Knowing the kind of man Captain America seemed to be, he would blame himself for Tony being taken that day. And Tony had just made a joke about it.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Idiot.&rdquo; He agreed, dressing in the beautiful Liana Lee suit Pepper had ordered for the awards ceremony he was supposed to attend that night. They&rsquo;d started letting him out again now that Hammer was even deeper behind bars than before and the ICC seemed under control.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Well, he was free until someone told Fury about today&rsquo;s little event.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He found Steve in the gym half an hour later, methodically killing a punching bag with only the lightest sheen of sweat to indicate his effort. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Tony began, trying not to ogle too openly. &ldquo;How sorry do I have to be exactly? I mean, are we talking an apology and a trip to that gallery you were telling me about or do I have to fly us to the Uffizi for cocktails?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve didn&rsquo;t respond, taped knuckles continuing to pound a perfect repetition of blows on the slick red vinyl.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He was Tony Stark; he wasn&rsquo;t familiar with being ignored. Tony toyed with the idea of walking out but then swallowed a sudden ball of real worry. Cap ignoring him was rude. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He&rsquo;d thought the man incapable of being rude to anyone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Uffizi it is then.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d get Mrs. Arbogast to line up the jet.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The punching halted abruptly. Steve caught the bag and rested his forehead against it, eyes closed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You hate art.&rdquo; His voice wasn&rsquo;t exactly friendly, but at least he was acknowledging Tony&rsquo;s existence.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Not true,&rdquo; Tony countered, daring a few feet closer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>like</i> it, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it makes me angry or anything. I own heaps. You like it, I like you and I&rsquo;m sorry I said that about the park. So we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The blue eyes were still closed but a small smile curled Cap&rsquo;s lips. Tony relaxed a fraction.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You can get us into the Uffizi Gallery?&rdquo; Steve asked, intrigued.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony snorted. &ldquo;I can get us in anywhere. We&rsquo;d have to go in the evening when all the tourists aren&rsquo;t queuing up outside. There&rsquo;re only so many autographs I can sign after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Steve disagreed, causing Tony&rsquo;s stomach to drop and an internal monologue to begin cursing his arrogance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to queue up like everyone else. It&rsquo;s part of the experience.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;okay?&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t really agree that waiting in line for three hours with tired tourists was needed to appreciate the art inside, but if Steve was letting himself be flown to Florence with Tony then he&rsquo;d stand in the damn queue all day if he had to.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be next week, Nick needs me for&hellip;.&rdquo; Steve turned from the bag, words trailing off into nothing as he looked over at Tony. Tony saw the blue gaze take in the perfect hair, expensive shoes and the thousands of dollars of suit lovingly encasing his figure in between.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">If Tony had been capable of blushing anymore, the heat in that blue gaze would have triggered one.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He smiled. &ldquo;I have an awards ceremony tonight. You like the suit?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve seemed to catch himself, wrenching his eyes back up to Tony&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Tony turned and walked to the door, acutely aware of the likelihood of the other man&rsquo;s gaze dropping again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it to Florence.&rdquo;</span></p><br /></lj-cut>"

The &lsquo;Crazy Bug Witches&rsquo; (Tony was sticking with that till they voted otherwise) had managed to summon dozens of huge spiders and set them on the Brooklyn Bridge. According to SHEILD there were two hundred and twelve civilians caught fast within the massive web that now shrouded the entire structure. It was like looking at an enormous white cotton candy with the occasional disturbing black shape moving within. Spider web was incredibly strong in relation to its thinness. It&rsquo;s also really, really sticky.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thor will take Hawkeye to burn a path to the centre using combustible missiles while we work our way in releasing as many people as possible.&rdquo; Cap looked like he would rather be the one flying in with a flame thrower, but they couldn&rsquo;t risk burning the webs until all the civilians were out. &ldquo;Reports say there is at least a dozen spiders the size of cars, but one as big as a bus. That&rsquo;s the main target Hawkeye. If you can find her, you and Thor are okay to kill if subdual is impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sir, scans indicate the tensile strength of the web is insufficient to resist the power of the armour or Captain America&rsquo;s augmented musculature.&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> JARVIS reported.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;JARVIS says we can break it.&rdquo; Iron Man informed Cap.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow and bring the civilians out back along the path you make.&rdquo; Widow offered.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You mean you can&rsquo;t just climb the webs?&rdquo; Tony asked, grinning behind the faceplate.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">As the rest of the Avengers turned to look at her, Natasha rolled her eyes.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a code name you idiot.&rdquo; Black Widow walked to the web gummed asphalt with arms impatiently folded as Thor lifted a snickering Hawkeye high into the air.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The difficulty in traversing the web laid more in clearing a large enough tunnel rather than breaking the actual strands themselves. Tony was pleased to note that Iron Man was stronger than Captain America, human perfection or not. However, he was no-where near as agile as the leather clad man easily ducking through the criss-cross maze. It took less than a moment for Iron Man to brush away a dozen of the thick rope-like strands, it took longer to pull off all the resulting broken pieces and cross lines that then caught on his arms and legs as he moved.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Are you statically charged?&rdquo; Widow asked from behind as they approached the first cocooned car.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Tony tore away yet another bunch of strands. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t have super dodge powers like you two.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap stopped at the hood of a large SUV held vertically off the ground by several massive web cables. Inside the half obscured window, a man was trying to get the Avengers&rsquo; attention. This situation was more Iron Man&rsquo;s speed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Cap? I can bring the car down and get them out. Why don&rsquo;t you clear the way to the next one.&rdquo; Tony suggested, carefully picking his way forward.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo; Cap nodded. &ldquo;Widow, stay here till they&rsquo;re free. We&rsquo;ll make a production line to get them out.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It worked perfectly for the first five cars they came across. Iron Man pulling cars down and wrenching off doors so Widow could lead relived New Yorkers back to a SHEILD base at the end of the bridge. Over the comm. Hawkeye reported mixed success with burning a tunnel into the centre of the webs. They were making progress, just very slowly.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I just hope the spiders aren&rsquo;t eating someone while we slog through this mess.&rdquo; Cap worried as Tony caught up to him at a motorcyclist webbed a little too close to the edge of the bridge for anyone&rsquo;s liking.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Iron Man reached up and caught the front wheel, setting his feet before pulling the bike down to street level.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Captain America tugged off the tight clinging strands till the woman could move enough to take off her helmet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; He reassured her, flinching slightly as she hugged him in thanks.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;This way please.&rdquo; Tony noticed the kernel of amusement in Widow&rsquo;s normally expressionless voice. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thank you so much&hellip;&rdquo; The rider continued to Cap as she was escorted down the path they had cleared through the web.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised she&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; Tony looked through the while knotted mess to the next vehicle JARVIS pin-pointed. &ldquo;She had no protection, but was bound up like the cars for later.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We have no idea exactly what the cult did to the spiders,&rdquo; Cap determinedly started pulling at the next bundle of webbing. &ldquo;They might not be acting like their smaller counterparts.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;&rdquo; Tony wasn&rsquo;t sure he agreed. The wasps in Midtown had seemed normal&hellip;just huge.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sir, there is a creature&hellip;&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Thinking that over, Tony almost missed JARVIS&rsquo; warning, but he managed to turn just in time to catch the full impact of a spider the size of an elephant. Iron Man went down under eight point-tipped legs and more than usual amount of arachnid aggression.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on PCP or something.&rdquo; Tony gritted out, catching one hook before it gouged a hole in his face plate. He wasn&rsquo;t particularly worried he&rsquo;d be hurt by the monster. Iron Man could take a tank round to the chest with only scratched paint to show for it, but the amount of webbing being spun around him was going to be hell to remove.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The creature shuddered and gave a high pitched squeal that had JARVIS dialing down the volume on his microphones.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; he suggested, bracing himself for the scream as Captain America&rsquo;s shield impacted against the spider&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Iron Man, my shield&rsquo;s doing damage, but it isn&rsquo;t giving up.&rdquo; Cap advised.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo; It was likely a bad idea, but Tony gave up on dodging mandibles and offered the spider a double repulsor blast to the abdomen.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It was only a bad idea in that he was mostly attached to a now dead spider suspended forty feet off the ground.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Crap.&rdquo; Tony muttered as he pulled ineffectively at the strands stuck fast around Iron Man&rsquo;s arms. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Can you use your boots to fly up an out?&rdquo; Cap asked over the comm.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;JARVIS? What do you think?&rdquo; Tony watched the HUD making calculations and setting course trajectories.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;There is a sixty-eight point nine percent chance are you could exit the web by using the boot repulsors, Sir. But, there is a small risk of colliding with one of the captured civilian vehicles and an even greater risk of becoming even more entangled in the web.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Fantastic.&rdquo; The odds were pretty good, but Tony really didn&rsquo;t want to be trapped deeper in the web for the others to rescue when they had the chance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, but there&rsquo;s a chance it&rsquo;ll get worse not better,&rdquo; he reported.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use my shield to break the webs near your arms then you can tear away the rest and drop down.&rdquo; Cap offered.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Tony snorted. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m stuck then your shield will be caught like a fly. I&rsquo;ll try the fly-out option.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t get stuck.&rdquo; Was that actually a tone of offense in Captain America&rsquo;s voice?</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yes, it will.&rdquo; Tony had JARVIS plot a course.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Cap was adamant.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Fifty bucks says is will.&rdquo; Tony tugged once again at the webs securing his arms and threw a glare at the dead spider hanging just to his left.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the offense was gone to be replaced by calculation. &ldquo;The shield doesn&rsquo;t get stuck; you&rsquo;ll come to the Neue Galerie to see the Klimt exhibition with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Well. That was an easy bet to take because Tony could always&hellip;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No getting Virginia to substitute for you either.&rdquo; Captain America was apparently a telepath as well.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Tony conceded. &ldquo;But if it does get stuck you come to Detroit with me in January for NAIAS.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; He heard Cap ask Widow sotto voce.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;North American International Auto Show,&rdquo; she replied.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;A car show?&rdquo; Cap confirmed with Tony.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a candy shop.&rdquo; Tony stopped struggling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to hold my credit cards though. I get a bit dreamy and buy too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal.&rdquo; This time it was smug satisfaction in the other man&rsquo;s tone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony realized why when a red, white and blue disc severed the strands around his left arm and spun lazily back to its wielder.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Tony began as he started tearing away web with his newly freed army. &ldquo;How&rsquo;re Hawkeye and Thor doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Not very well, as they found out two cars later. Widow had just returned from escorting a family out of the web when Hawkeye&rsquo;s swearing reached them over the comm.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We need back-up people.&rdquo; He yelled as the high pitched screams of angry spiders came through from the background.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Curling a gentle arm around Widow and a more solid one around Captain America, Iron Man flew them directly back along the way they had come and high into the air over the bridge.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;There.&rdquo; Cap spotted the tunnel forged by Hawkeye&rsquo;s arrows, blackened web still smoldering at the edges.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Status?&rdquo; Their leader asked as Tony hovered over the hole.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;SpiderBus is kinda angry at us for rescuing her lunch,&rdquo; Hawkeye was panting now, &ldquo;and I set fire to Thor&rsquo;s cloak.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Widow yelled as Tony carefully lowered them so they didn&rsquo;t brush against embers or the web itself.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Say when.&rdquo; Iron Man could see the battle now, Hawkeye&rsquo;s arrows peppering a monstrous dark form as Thor stood toe-to-toe with the behemoth.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I fucked up,&rdquo; Hawkeye cursed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s burned on the shoulders and back, but not too badly. Where are you guys?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Captain America said as Iron Man dropped him from fifty feet in the air directly onto the great spider&rsquo;s back.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Now.&rdquo; Widow followed suit at thirty-five feet, landing beside an overwhelmed Hawkeye with guns blazing.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Iron Man finally settled next to Thor, JARVIS scanning the soot stained god for major injuries. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Having fun?&rdquo; He asked while alternating repulsor blasts with the impacts of Mjolnir on the great spider.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Concise in battle as always. Tony took a leaf from that book and bit his tongue while attacking both the big black funnel web trying to eat Cap as well as keep her elephant-sized daughters from killing the rest of them.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Weather he had learned spider anatomy or was just that awesome, Tony could only guess, as between one second and the next the great spider shuddered and died under Cap&rsquo;s assault. She twisted and twitched for several seconds, pulling the webs around her into further disarray. Emerging covered in red and black gore, Captain America fixed his shield back into place and looked for the next target.<br /><br /></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The spider&rsquo;s companions then went a little crazy and doubled their efforts to eat Hawkeye.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Repulsors aimed, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America rejoined the battle.</span></p></lj-cut>"

"event","<p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Chapter 5""><p><b><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Chapter 5 </span></b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The Avengers were back. Paris photo ops done, politicians impressed, scaring the living crap out of any local bad guys achieved. Cap was looking particularly gorgeous as they landed in the back gardens, shield hooked over his shoulders and eyes smiling. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Well, look at you.&rdquo; He gestured to Tony&rsquo;s armor clad self.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony grinned behind the face plate and raised his arm. It was a testament to Steve&rsquo;s confidence in him that while Clint and Natasha visibly flinched, he simply watched Iron Man blast a crash-test dummy across the lawn and into a fish pond.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good to go Captain,&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t keep his enthusiasm from Iron Man&rsquo;s speakers. &ldquo;Sick to death of board meetings, patent negotiations and MRI&rsquo;s but more than ready to come out and play.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap&rsquo;s expression turned reluctant. &ldquo;Sorry Tony, that&rsquo;s Nick&rsquo;s decision not mine.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony snorted. &ldquo;Funnily enough, he said the same thing. Except in reverse. So not actually the <i>same</i> thing but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Steve frowned, moving closer now that Tony seemed less likely to obliterate inanimate objects in his vicinity. &ldquo;My understanding was he would oversee team member active status while I, um, Tony?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo; Tony hovered five feet in the air just near Cap&rsquo;s shoulder. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Could you come down here? It&rsquo;s strange to speak to your feet, especially when they could burn my face off.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Iron Man landed easily. &ldquo;Sorry. This is so much easier with the ICC contact nodes. The armor was never &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; or anything but now it&rsquo;s like a second skin. It responds to me just by concentrating on a specific task. To be honest,&rdquo; he lowered his voice to as much of a whisper as he could while still on speaker. &ldquo;I think JARVIS is a little jealous.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap&rsquo;s smile returned, albeit a cautious one. &ldquo;Only you could think your machine friend is jealous of your relationship with your armor.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The red and gold plating wasn&rsquo;t designed to convey a shrug, but Tony gave it his best shot. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s still the most complex AI ever invented, but the ICC&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t think it would work as well as this.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Nick. Could you take off the helmet?&rdquo; Cap asked, expression returned to one of good humor now that Tony&rsquo;s personality seemed mostly unaffected by the changes wrought on his body. &ldquo;I like to look at you when I&rsquo;m talking to you.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony turned that sentence over in his brain for a few long, pleasurable seconds. Reaching up, he unlocked the catches that held the helmet in place; cool afternoon air caught in his hair and ruffled it. Blue eyes zeroed in on the black primary hub still adorning Tony&rsquo;s left temple.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still there.&rdquo; Captain America was not impressed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony ignored the vaguely sick feeling in his gut and forced himself to admire the completely neutral tone of Steve&rsquo;s voice. Pity about the eyes.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yeah, surgical removal deemed too risky at the moment.&rdquo; Proud of his cool &lsquo;don&rsquo;t give a shit&rsquo; voice, Tony turned back to the garage. Obviously Cap wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy looking at his face for conversations <i>now.</i></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Almost noiseless footsteps followed him. &ldquo;Does it hurt you?&rdquo; Concern now, which Tony appreciated, but it couldn&rsquo;t erase the glimmer of disgust he&rsquo;d seen.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Not even a little.&rdquo; Removing the gauntlets, Tony dropped them carelessly onto his workbench and said, &ldquo;JARVIS? Assess all data from repulsor testing and compile a report for Coulson and Fury please.&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Certainly Sir.&rdquo; </span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A low thump behind him as Steve put his shield down. &ldquo;So, I was thinking of New Orleans this Friday&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Not the best idea.&rdquo; And yes, that was a little harsh, but Tony wasn&rsquo;t really up to playing recruiter at the moment. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Tony tapped his finger against the hub, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t public knowledge yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Pepper and Tony&rsquo;s new PA Mrs. Arbogast were still wrangling over the wording of the press release.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Given that they were just dancing around this idea of being friends, Tony could be forgiven for thinking Steve wasn&rsquo;t particularly intuitive about emotions. When all was said and done, Tony thought Captain America was noble, honest, incredibly cute, polite and an all round fucking wonderful human being. Adding brains and empathy to that combination just wouldn&rsquo;t be fair. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Occasionally Tony was wrong.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I hate that thing on your face because it was done without your permission.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s words stopped Tony cold on the assembly platform. He didn&rsquo;t look up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried because, even with all your tests, it could still do something horrible to you or with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony dared one quick glance. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I promise.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Steve stood, arms crossed across the star on his broad chest. &ldquo;It reminds me that Hammer took you from us and forced that thing into you. I want to tear it out and crush it into a million pieces.&rdquo; Seeing Tony&rsquo;s frantic expression, Steve smiled grimly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I promise.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">His vow right back at him. Tony loosened up his tense shoulders. &ldquo;JARVIS, if you please?&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Of course Sir.&rdquo; </span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Unusually concise, the AI removed the rest of the Iron Man armor from Tony.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Stepping down, Tony was glad he&rsquo;d worn the black bodysuit under the armor for the testing process. Catching up a tablet, he offered it to Cap as he walked over. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;All the details and results of the tests are in there. You okay with this hardware now?&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Taking the tablet, Steve glanced at the test on the screen. &ldquo;Getting there, it&rsquo;s very strange.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even imagine.&rdquo; He really couldn&rsquo;t. To be seventy years behind the current technology would break his brain. &ldquo;I can tell you more about how it works over dinner?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve&rsquo;s head came up with a jerk, eyes bright. &ldquo;Absolutely. You have somewhere in mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony had <i>meant</i> up at the mansion with the team, but realizing he&rsquo;d just asked Steve out and been accepted, he thought furiously. &ldquo;Sure do. Wear something nice and we&rsquo;ll leave at seven?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;See you then.&rdquo; Lifting his shield in his spare hand, Cap strode briskly out the door.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Crap.&rdquo; Tony cursed. &ldquo;How the hell did I manage that?&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder to me as well, Sir.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Richard Delven was about as unimpressed by Tony as it was possible to be. Saving the world, obliterating terrorism and revolutionizing the computer industry was nothing to the man who Tony guessed was just shy of eight feet tall and built like Thor&rsquo;s big brother. He&rsquo;d suspect a super power or demi-godhood but for the SHEILD file proclaiming his new bodyguard one hundred percent ordinary human. Just very tall, with a glare that would rival a super model on the chiseled black features.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Did I actually impregnate your sister or do you just loathe me on principle?&rdquo; Tony asked while he waited for Steve in the foyer.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a sister Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Delven answered in a smooth, uninterested baritone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony was mildly nervous tonight for two reasons. One, he&rsquo;d landed a date with Steve and was either going to mess up tragically or start making some headway towards seeing that perfect body sans clothes. Two, Delven had Tony&rsquo;s suitcase armor cuffed to his wrist. Oakley had been carrying Tony&rsquo;s case.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing Kevlar aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Tony wondered as Steve walked down the staircase.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Almost swallowing his tongue, Tony wondered what it was about men born near the start of the twentieth century that they could all walk into a room like Cary Grant. The sports coat and dress pants even looked like they had been cut by a thirties tailor.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Nice clothes.&rdquo; Tony offered the massive understatement. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Steve smiled. &ldquo;Virginia organized them for me.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony frowned in confusion. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Pepper,&rdquo; Natasha reminded him, stepping down behind Steve. &ldquo;Now that the panic is over, your car is here. Make sure you&rsquo;ve got your phones.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Suspecting that Natasha had a mission plan already lodged for this dinner, Tony waved his new cell under her nose. &ldquo;What panic?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Steve caught Tony&rsquo;s elbow, nodded a compatriot smile to Delven and guided him out the door.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The Alietres maitre-de hadn&rsquo;t battered an eyelid at the sunglasses not quite hiding the tech on Tony&rsquo;s face. She&rsquo;d simply led them to an exclusive private nook, taken their orders and left. Waiters never had a chance to work at Tony Stark&rsquo;s table; he&rsquo;d been served by owners themselves rather than risk the staff making him unhappy.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Odd really, he wasn&rsquo;t<i> that</i> hard to please.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I read your file just after we found you.&rdquo; Tony thought it best to be up-front from the start. &ldquo;You won a few art prizes before you joined up?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A light pink stained Steve&rsquo;s cheeks. &ldquo;A few.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve saved, like, a thousand lives, faced down Hitler, received the thanks of a grateful nation, had about fifty marriage proposals and your art prizes embarrass you?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve chuckled before taking a drink of his wine. &ldquo;Those other things were after I changed. The art is just me.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Seeing the truth of that, Tony was intrigued. &ldquo;You wanted to be an artist?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No, I wanted to be a soldier.&rdquo; Steve nodded his thanks to the maitre de as she placed his meal before him. &ldquo;I make my art because it&rsquo;s part of me, it isn&rsquo;t a choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; No wonder Steve called Pepper &lsquo;Virginia&rsquo; they&rsquo;d likely been discussing Picasso for hours or something.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve gave Tony an assessing look. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been born Tony Stark, what would you be?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He didn&rsquo;t even really need to think about it. &ldquo;A mechanic.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve nodded encouragingly. &ldquo;Because you like working on cars.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Well, probably a designer for Oracle or someone really. But when it&rsquo;s all said and done, I&rsquo;m a mechanic.&rdquo; Tony knew his degrees would argue that, but it was fundamentally true.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m a painter.&rdquo; Steve smiled. &ldquo;Nice to meet you Tony the Mechanic.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony laughed. &ldquo;Pleasure&rsquo;s all mine.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Steve ventured with a cautious tone. &ldquo;I looked over the results you gave me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Work talk,&rdquo; Tony cut him off. &ldquo;Is forbidden over dinner, it&rsquo;s a twenty-first century thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; An amused glint entered baby blue eyes. &ldquo;What shall we talk about then?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony swirled the ice in his very well behaved lime and soda. It rarely took much effort to get the people he wanted into bed. Mostly all Tony had to do was choose, but then, he&rsquo;d never really tried with someone he actually liked before. Pepper and Rhodey were both delicious, but he&rsquo;d never wanted to take the risk of trying to seduce them for fear of it becoming more than just lust mingled with liking.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve Rogers was probably going to fall into that very same boat.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Well, tell me what&rsquo;s so great about Pepper&rsquo;s modern art collection.&rdquo; But he <i>was</i> Tony Stark and faced with the perfect package that was Steve, he couldn&rsquo;t help himself.</span></p></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Chapter 4""><p><b><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Chapter 4</span></b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Instead of a big black blur, I can see a big white blur,&rdquo; Tony murmured as he listened to the chaos of the lab around him. After not listening to Fury shout at him over the phone for ten minutes, he&rsquo;d threatened his way back to the mansion and the huge ball room set aside for Bruce to outfit as he chose. A SHIELD doctor had met them as Tony staggered in under Cap&rsquo;s arm. The guy had said &lsquo;I have no idea&rsquo; a lot, taped up Tony&rsquo;s sprained wrist and left.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He was pretty sure Pepper wasn&rsquo;t going to injure him with the new tablet he&rsquo;d designed for her, but she&rsquo;d had that funny wobble in her voice that made him feel guilty even though nothing had been his fault -- this time. The casters on the chair Cap was sitting in at Tony&rsquo;s knees made tiny mouse-like squeaks every time the man shifted and the edge of the shield pressed against his thigh from its position on the gurney at Tony&rsquo;s side. From the low thumps he could discern, Tony suspected Steve had folded his arms on the white star and was occasionally drumming his fingers in uncharacteristic impatience. Tony couldn&rsquo;t see any of that of course, but he had become a lover of his hearing in the last three hours. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony certainly appreciated the company.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Of course, Justin Hammer hadn&rsquo;t been working all on his lonesome. Even with his personal fortune, the man wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to access the funds needed for the ICC tech without some serious backing. Fury thought it was North Korea, Agent Coulson suspected Russia, maybe one of Vanko&rsquo;s connections. Hammer had just smiled his slithering executive smile and demanded a lawyer. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Coulson&rsquo;s response had been, &ldquo;Yeah, good luck with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not active,&rdquo; Bruce was now telling the SHEILD team leader. &ldquo;The tech has infiltrated his entire system, centering around the arc reactor where it&rsquo;s taking power. Now it&rsquo;s established, it&rsquo;s gone dormant.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;And?&rdquo;&nbsp;Coulson sounded like he was prepared to put a bullet in Tony&rsquo;s skull at the slightest incentive.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;And nothing&hellip;&rdquo; Tony could practically see the physicist shrug. &ldquo;This hasn&rsquo;t ever been done before. There are no protocols or tactics. It&rsquo;s not my field; I don&rsquo;t even know how to turn it on.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">As he listened to the ongoing discussion, Tony rubbed his fingers over his forehead and tried to remember every damn inch of those schematics. At maximum the ICC had been a theory, a possibility wrapped in a idea and mentioned flippantly to a two star General with the hope that Tony could be dared into making something truly insane for his government to play with. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The General&rsquo;s eyes had shone with something akin to lust at the schematics on the lap-top in front of him. That is until, Tony told him it was ridiculous and would cost the annual gross revenue of Canada just to make one. Typical that only people as batshit crazy as Vanko and Hammer would find the fucking thing, let alone finance its creation.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Gentle fingers on his knee startled Tony from his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be just outside.&rdquo; Cap murmured into Tony&rsquo;s ear. Oh, like he&rsquo;d be able to think rationally for the next hour after Steve just sent about a million shivers down his spine with those four words.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The gurney shifted as a person sat beside Tony and strong fingers cupped the back of his skull to bring the tech closer to a light.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh hell, Tony.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Rhodey,&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a fucking sob&hellip;it wasn&rsquo;t. Just that holding his shit together in front of Steve and Coulson was one thing. This was Rhodey and he&rsquo;d never been impressed by Tony&rsquo;s cool. Dragging in a deep breath, he took control of the ache in his throat. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m sick of having things stuck in me without even dinner first.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Rhodey didn&rsquo;t even chuckle, too busy with looking over the abomination attached to his friend&rsquo;s face. Tony could just see the solid man shaped blur against the lighter walls of the ballroom. At least his sight was coming back, if slowly.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clean.&rdquo; A sigh of relief left Tony at the confidence in Jim Rhodes&rsquo; voice. &ldquo;The casing is StarkTech, and from what I can see of the wires and welds it&rsquo;s exactly like those blueprints Pepper found. It&rsquo;s clean.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">When Rhodey released Tony&rsquo;s head, he tentatively reached up and fingered the device. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a feeling in the back of my neck, like a bird battering at a window. I think it&rsquo;s the executable file, pinging me that it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it do?&rdquo; Warm, steady voice to match the hands. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Probably nothing.&rdquo; Tony hoped like hell he was right. &ldquo;This tech was designed to incorporate weapons into a human body. Like fusing a gun to your femur, or a scope onto your forehead. This is the system that melds the two with nanoware and a bioloc virus. Hammer didn&rsquo;t get time to finish the installation so it should be harmless.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Harmless?&rdquo; Rhodey sounded hugely skeptical. &ldquo;I hope so. Hammer didn&rsquo;t count on the other Avengers getting you back so quickly, he was probably planning to implant the weapons as soon as you were stable, but SHEILD found the building first.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Took them long enough.&rdquo; Tony bitched as he squinted; the room was starting to resolve itself into shapes of differing size and depth.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A small disapproving sound from Rhodey. &ldquo;No-one had any idea where they&rsquo;d taken you Tony. It wasn&rsquo;t until Romonoff realized that Hammer had been sighted back in New York that they started checking his properties here.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m just pissed I was the one being rescued rather than getting to be the big damn hero.&rdquo; Tony waved a hand in dismissal, then waved it again as it looked like a smoky cloud in the left of his vision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking I should see what the hell this does before it gets too far in. Right now surgery is almost impossible, but there&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We need about a year&rsquo;s worth of scans to make sure it&rsquo;s not killing you&hellip;&rdquo; Rhodey began.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No, we have to test this thing in my brain to see what he did&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">They were talking over each other as usual, but then both men fell silent as one of the monitors started a high pitched whine.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;That better just need new batteries,&rdquo; Tony felt two distinct pulses in his forehead and that weird bird-at-the-window feeling went silent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s active! Rhodey&hellip;get out&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony&rsquo;s blurred vision became black again as a solid cocoon enclosed first his face, then his arms. A small spark, like a static shock pinged at the back of his mind, but Tony was too concerned with the way his arm was moving without benefit of a direct order from his brain, to pay it much heed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">An explosion nearby. Yelling and the sound of things, many lab-like things, becoming slag.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Repulsor gauntlet. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He was in the armor and shooting up Bruce&rsquo;s lab. If there had been anything that could make this day worse, after the kidnapping, blinding and assault thing&hellip;then going crazy and wiping out the mansion would do it. Small burning points of fire at his shoulders, sides and along his spine. Like spiders dancing on his nerve endings, Tony could feel his body changing to meet the technology encasing his skin.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It hurt, a lot.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The tiny shock hit him again. Tony ignored it again in favor of wrenching his arm down to his side and listening to the yelling going on at what was once the door.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Now would be the time for guns over here!&rdquo; Because yeah, Iron Man killing an innocent person? Tony was pretty sure he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to live with that guilt on top of all the rest. &ldquo;Shooting me! Shooting me is the plan people!&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A large electrical jolt hit him moments after a third tiny shock. The Widow&rsquo;s Bite. &ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; He yelled, &ldquo;Try something bigger. Get Thor.&rdquo; The rest of his armor had formed around his legs and torso, merging one by one with each contact point of fire. He was completely incased in a devastating weapon, one that was completely out of his control.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A great heave had the left repulsor aimed off-target before it fired towards the shouting.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; Well Tony, not like you didn&rsquo;t get eighteen months of life you didn&rsquo;t deserve anyway. With what little control he had of the left gauntlet, he raised it until the weapon within was aimed directly into the arc reactor. &ldquo;Tell Pepper&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Captain America&rsquo;s shield did hurt like a motherfucker, even through the armor on his elbow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Another tiny shock, combined with damage done by Cap and for a split second Tony had control. He reached for that small burst of energy and hoped like hell he wasn&rsquo;t imagining things.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A backdoor opened.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;JARVIS, system maintenance override now!&rdquo; Tony felt the system shudder as the AI battled whatever the fuck virus Vanko had installed. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Iron Man stopped moving.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Maintenance subroutine running, Sir. Shutting down all armour systems and initiating sleep mode.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;JARVIS, you win the internet.&rdquo; As the armor fell over with Tony still inside, he grimaced at the sound of cautiously approaching footsteps. </span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;My code is far superior in design, Sir. Once I had access, it was a simple matter to contain the intruder.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t delete it yet.&rdquo; Tony inhaled sharply at a sudden brightness as the face plate was lifted away. Steve looked like he was leaning over a swimming pool with Tony underneath the water.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;the hell?&rdquo; Those blue eyes really shouldn&rsquo;t have to go through all the things Tony was currently making them express.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Tell me I didn&rsquo;t kill Rhodey.&rdquo; Because convincing Jarvis to free up one of the repulsors for Tony to use on himself would be a bitch. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t kill Rhodey.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s own eyes stung with the strain of looking for details. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Okay, right here and now you listen.&rdquo; He wished he could grab Steve&rsquo;s uniform to make his point clear. &ldquo;Remember this&hellip; override two, zero, zero, eight, why, eye, ehn, ess, eye, ehn&hellip;okay? Should I repeat it?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No, I got it.&rdquo; From the funnel vision the helmet gave him, Steve looked confident and worried at the same time. &ldquo;That will shut you down?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Tony didn&rsquo;t mention that the shock of the armor dropping so suddenly could damage the arc reactor. But then again, if Cap thought he needed to be put down, Tony would take the risk.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Rhodey&rsquo;s face suddenly shared space with Steve&rsquo;s in Tony&rsquo;s line of sight. &ldquo;Nothing to incorporate into you huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;How the fuck did it get in here?&rdquo; He asked.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Blasted through the window from the garage. Banner says it used a magnetic field and&hellip;&rdquo; Rhodey trailed off as someone else walked over.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Why does it always have to be about you Stark?&rdquo; Nick Fury exuded exasperation from every pore.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony wiped away the condensation on his bathroom mirror and finally worked up the courage to look. </span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It crouched like a shiny black beetle on his temple, one single delicate antenna nestled in strands of Tony&rsquo;s wet hair.&nbsp;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He&rsquo;d been unwilling to touch it while Rhodey and Jarvis had been running tests. So many tests. Finally Fury had decided Tony could be released from the armor and allowed to clean up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He could pick out each different section, like the carapace of a futuristic robot beetle.</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The arc reactor glowed with its clean white energy. Tony had wanted to save himself with the new element, but Hammer had made the final decision. It didn&rsquo;t matter that he'd made himself a new, pretty heart, the wicked monster on his face made its purpose clear.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">An angry beetle that wanted him to kill his friends.</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He turned to look over his shoulder at his back. By contrast the contact nodes on his skin were almost attractive. Like funky tattoos that only the most eccentric of billionaires would buy, the blue detail lines with their faintly glowing gold spheres were at least symmetrical. A small, broken sigh escaped Tony as he met his own gaze. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No more suntans in Majorca for you.&rdquo; He whispered with a wry smile.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony watched from the roof as the Avengers left for Paris. The sight of War Machine lifting Cap up into the air shot a sharp pang of jealousy through Tony, his chances of getting his hands on that body were few and far between.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So completely unfair.&rdquo; He complained to Pepper as he headed back inside to Bruce&rsquo;s wreck of a lab. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">His super-efficient CEO&rsquo;s heels clicked neatly on the marble floor. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. You should be on the meet and greet in Paris, nothing says we&rsquo;re here to help like a repulsor blast through the French President.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Granted, that would look bad.&rdquo; Tony pushed open the doors and wandered over to one of the monitors. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve run every scan possible on me and the armor. The remote operating system is fried, Jarvis laid on a massive bitch-slap so it&rsquo;s not going to take over again.&rdquo; He watched the code as it scrolled relentlessly across the screens around them.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Pepper countered as she zipped through information on her tablet.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yes, I do. I invented this thing, Hammer just fucked around with it a little.&rdquo; Everything was clear, no sign of the malignant code in any of the armor systems. A tentative wireless hook-up with Jarvis to the tech in Tony had also revealed a clean slate waiting for new instructions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna turn it on again.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo; Pepper turned on her heel.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Tony.&rdquo; Bruce&rsquo;s suppressing tone was almost enough to divert him from his goal. Almost.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon. I&rsquo;m wearing my sexy new bondage device, let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo; Tony fingered the black stainless steel necklace he was currently sporting. Coulson had nearly strangled him with it after one too many SHEILD and their sex toys jokes when he&rsquo;d been shown the thing. It wasn&rsquo;t Tony&rsquo;s fault that SHEILD liked imprisoning people with electro-shock collars and nipple clamps.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Okay, maybe not nipple clamps. But Fury had almost cracked a smile while the younger SHEILD agent&rsquo;s long-suffering expression upgraded to highly exasperated. The collar pinched like a bitch too.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Bruce&rsquo;s unflappable gaze was frankly unconvinced, yet&hellip;&rdquo; The helmet only, no gauntlets until Thor&rsquo;s back to taser you if you go dark side.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Deal.&rdquo; Tony grinned, catching up his helmet and bringing Jarvis online.</span></p></lj-cut><br />"

You get where I&rsquo;m coming from? So maybe&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Not going to work Tony, my boy, my friend.&rdquo; Justin Hammer&rsquo;s unmistakable burr filled the ply-wood box of an office.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony blinked and stared. Closed his eyes tight. Looked again. Sandy hair, expensive glasses, bad cologne. Nope, not a hallucination. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Hammer?&rdquo; Tony couldn&rsquo;t smother the utter astonishment in his voice. &ldquo;You&hellip;what?&nbsp;Hired people to kidnap me? Are you out of your low-rent, mundane, never-had-an-original-idea mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">His rival sauntered over from the door and crouched directly in front of Tony, resting his elbows on his captive&rsquo;s scruffy knees. &ldquo;No Anthony, no I&rsquo;m not. But&hellip;I have discovered something very important about myself. Would you like to know what that is Anthony?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Really, really no.&rdquo; Tony promised.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yeah you do. It&rsquo;s easy to have a personal epiphany while sitting in a federal prison for nine months. So many days waiting for lawyers to argue and bribe me out of there. So many plans to make.&rdquo; The fact that Hammer was idly tracing the hole in the denim over the seated man&rsquo;s thigh while he made conversation made Tony&rsquo;s skin crawl.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Hopefully your plan is as good as your tech,&rdquo; Tony forced out the slur to hide a cringe.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Ha! I knew you&rsquo;d say something like that, something bitchy and rude about my talent, but that&rsquo;s fine Tony baby.&rdquo; A sudden lunge had Justin right up in Tony&rsquo;s face, noses touching, and nails digging into his knees with a bloodless grip. &ldquo;Because my plan is happening right here, right now. I&rsquo;ve got my new friends,&rdquo; expansive gesture at the lurking guards, &ldquo;the best money can buy. Plus, I&rsquo;ve got Tony Stark strapped to a fucking chair with his goddamn metal suit back in its box somewhere. Am I right?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">None of the guards answered. They didn&rsquo;t need to.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So my plan, my nine month epiphany is this&hellip;&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s breath hissed out as Justin leaned to one side to whisper in his ear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to screw you in every possible way known to man, Baby.&rdquo; His gut clenched in nausea, Tony forced himself not to shrink away. &ldquo;Firstly were going to play with this.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Leaning back Justin held in his hand a small device, somewhat larger than a blue-tooth mike with complex wiring and three small silver points along one face.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll love this Tony. &ldquo; All at once the creepy leer was gone and Justin the salesman was back. &ldquo;As soon as I was released I went through everything that psycho Vanko was working on and you&rsquo;ll never guess what he managed to hack into.&rdquo; Tony felt cold dread begin at the base of his spine. The device looked&hellip;no fucking way&hellip;no way. &ldquo;Stark Industries firewalls are some of the best in the world, but then again&hellip;so was Vanko.&rdquo; Justin looked lovingly at the small piece of tech. &ldquo;You designed this Tony so be proud. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s gonna make us both legends. If you survive of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Justin&hellip;it&rsquo;s a goddamn theory you fucking lunatic!&rdquo; Tony snarled, gaze never leaving the black thing in Hammer&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Biotech research and Ivan Vanko say otherwise Honeybunch and here&rsquo;s proof. Completely self-contained, individual biological cybernetics. Converting a man into a machine for the armed services.&rdquo; Hammer posed with a noble tilt to his chin.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony gritted his teeth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible, impractical and a fucking speculation I toyed with to freak out the generals&hellip;&rdquo; A cold hand covered his mouth as Hammer once again leaned over him.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No&hellip;it&rsquo;s real and it&rsquo;s here. The only thing missing&hellip;&rsquo; A lazy finger slipped from Tony&rsquo;s chin down to the collar of his t-shirt, &ldquo;&hellip;is an independent power supply.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Deciding that that was way more than enough, Tony kicked up hard into Justin&rsquo;s groin and twisted the chair onto its side. Scrambling quickly to his feet, he got about a dozen steps before he was tackled by one of the guards. Swearing the man forced Tony onto his back and essentially sat on his legs while another knelt at his head and held it steady.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I really want to kill you for that Tony my friend,&rdquo; Hammer gasped as he sank to his knees at his prisoner&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll feel my full appreciation for that kick later on when the surgery is over&hellip;I promise.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony really didn&rsquo;t give a damn about Justin&rsquo;s creepy threats of molestation because there was a huge fucking needle coming towards his eyes and god, no, no, no&hellip; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Just a little paralytic to relax the optic nerve,&rdquo; Justin explained as he tossed the needle aside, licking away a drop of blood from Tony&rsquo;s temple. &ldquo;&hellip;and now, we get to the fun part.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The last thing Tony saw before his vision went white was Justin Hammer activating the device and small electric buzz reached his reluctant ears.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Then the pain started.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Waking face down and blind in the back of a moving vehicle was low even on Tony&rsquo;s extensive list of fascinating places to regain consciousness. He reached up to where his left temple felt heavy and numb. The ties on his wrists were gone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">There was something stuck to his face. Tony tried to wedge a fingernail underneath the cool metallic shape.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s awake Boss.&rdquo; One of the guards, somewhere to his right.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him pull it out!&rdquo; Hammer&rsquo;s voice was no longer confident, straining with tension and worry. &ldquo;Who were the soldiers Tony? They weren&rsquo;t feds, I know fed&rsquo;s when I see them thanks to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Dropping his hand, Tony cleared a throat raw from screaming. &ldquo;To be fair, I didn&rsquo;t make you hire a wanted terrorist Hammer&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Shut the fuck up!&rdquo; The van lurched wildly to the right, causing Tony to roll into someone&rsquo;s knees. He pressed his hands down so he wouldn&rsquo;t break his face and grinned a bloody smile into the hard metal floor.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He smelled ozone.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the only one who made new friends.&rdquo; Because they were here, they&rsquo;d found him.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The van stopped violently, everyone within hurled towards the cab.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;lightening&hellip;god fuck&hellip;lightening right in front of us.&rdquo; The driver&rsquo;s yells were punctuated by a repetitive thumping down near Tony&rsquo;s feet.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Reverse! Reverse!&rdquo; From one of the men with a knee in Tony&rsquo;s back. The yells became a cacophony of panic.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been chasing us for the last mile on foot!&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;keep going&hellip;&rdquo; that was Hammer sounding scared at last, Tony was pleased to note. <br /><br /></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;...we don&rsquo;t have any front tires&hellip;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;he&rsquo;s here. Holy shit, holy shit&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The scream of metal being wrenched apart filled the van and then gunfire exploded over Tony&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s not gonna work,&rdquo; Tony muttered as the ricochets caused one of the men around him to slump down.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Several seconds of cold silence.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s dead&hellip;&rdquo; Captain America should not sound as if he were a breath away from cold-blooded murder.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Not dead,&rdquo; Tony rasped, pushing at the guard whose hand still held him to the floor. Sitting up he crawled in the vague direction from where Cap&rsquo;s voice had come. &ldquo;Just get me out of this goddamn van.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A sharp intake of breath and then a warm arm around his shoulders, a gloved hand at his hip to lift him out. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What is that on your face?&rdquo; Cap asked, voice still not completely under the usual precision control, concern and anger leeching through.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;A really modern hickey,&rdquo; Tony joked before his knees went out from under him. Steve&rsquo;s arm slipped to his waist and Tony could feel the shift in the man&rsquo;s weight as he&hellip;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Pick me up like a princess and I will magnetize your scale-mail, I swear to god I will.&rdquo; Cap froze for a second before a reluctant chuckle brushed Tony&rsquo;s ear.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Natasha sounded just as brutally calm as usual when two small, strong hands grabbed his face and turned it from side to side. &ldquo;Clint&rsquo;s tracking Hammer, he and Thor will bring him in. Huh. You&rsquo;ve been blinded?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony reached out with the hand not occupied on Cap&rsquo;s excellent shoulders and caught a deceptively slender arm.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s temporary, unless Hammer missed the nerve, which wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all.&rdquo; Tony did not even want to imagine what he looked like, new hardware, blood and all. &ldquo;Natasha, call Pepper. I need all our research on the ICC tech from the Vancouver meetings last year.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Natasha&rsquo;s arm slid from his grasp to be replaced by her hand. &ldquo;Her jet lands in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s ICC?&rdquo; Cap asked. Tony could hear booted feet crowding around him, muffled orders back at the van. SHIELD was here.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an ambulance.&rdquo; Natasha said.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Fuck that.&rdquo; Tony replied. As long as Steve didn&rsquo;t mind Tony hanging on him like a limpet, he&rsquo;d be fine.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap jostled him around so they were face to face. In the back of Tony&rsquo;s mind, the part that wasn&rsquo;t dealing with returning sensation in his temple, shock, anger and dislocation, he was mourning the loss of that up close view.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What. Is. ICC. Tony?&rdquo; It was an order.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony wasn&rsquo;t a soldier so he said nothing.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Natasha was. &ldquo;Independent Cybernetic Conversion.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He could practically see the small furrow of confusion between Steve&rsquo;s eye brows.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get the reference Cap, but essentially Hammer made me a Borg.&rdquo; </span><br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Chapter 2""><p><b><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Chapter 2</span></b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">One of the best things about Bruce Banner was that he liked Tony&rsquo;s music. Or really, as Tony suspected, instead of &lsquo;liked&rsquo; insert &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t notice&rsquo;, but either way they could work together under the rough voice of Trent Reznor without complaint.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I can make you angry.&rdquo; Tony offered from his back as he wrenched at a seized bolt under the 1967 Firebird. The physicist made no comment. &ldquo;Seriously, I can be incredibly irritating. If you could see under the eye patch there would be a twitch of canyon proportions whenever I talk to Fury.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Spraying oil onto the bolt, Tony tried to loosen it again.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I piss you off, you go steroid green and help&hellip;me&hellip;turn&hellip;this&hellip;bitch!&rdquo; Still wouldn&rsquo;t budge.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;If I get angry, it&rsquo;ll toss these cars through the windows and pound you into tiny engineer shaped pieces.&rdquo; Bruce was distracted by the simulations he had JARVIS working on. &ldquo;Then Pepper would frown and I&rsquo;m not man enough to deal with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh c&rsquo;mon.&rdquo; Tony wheedled. &ldquo;Last chance,&rdquo; he hissed at the bolt. Bracing himself on his heels, Tony lifted his hips off the ground, putting his full body weight onto the socket wrench. After two seconds a small shudder, then nothing. Tony slumped down.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s a super hero when you need one?&rdquo; He asked the cosmos.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Tony?&rdquo; There was a note of wry amusement in Captain America&rsquo;s voice. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony looked in despair at the underside of the muffler and indulged in a brief thirteen year old girl moment. Vintage would be a flattering term for the jeans he was wearing, boots unlaced, sweaty t-shirt, grease and oil smeared on his bare arms and yeah...nothing in his hair but finger trails. Some slick billionaire he turned out to be.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yeah, Cap?&rdquo; He asked in a slightly strained voice before he gave himself a mental shake. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Can you come out from under there, please?&rdquo; No matter how polite Jarvis had taught Tony to be, it would never rival the courtesy of a boy born in a bygone era.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Scooting out on his ass, Tony took in Cap&rsquo;s crouched figure, balanced easily on his toes, elbows on knees and fingers laced. His attire, just slightly more casual than the flag, army t-shirt and khaki pants reminded Tony that he&rsquo;d have to take the man shopping sometime. Military surplus was fine in the short term, but the man would be devastating in some well cut jeans, let alone Armani.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Ruthlessly dragging his gaze away from the fabric stretched taut across Steve&rsquo;s groin, Tony followed the direction of the blue eyes towards his red, fully restored 1938 SS Jaguar. His baby.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You can take her for a spin if you like.&rdquo; Tony offered.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Bruce made a strangled chocking sound. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap looked back with a narrowed, assessing gaze. &ldquo;Thank you, I will.&rdquo; But there seemed to be more behind the words that the obvious. &ldquo;Right now Tony, would you please buy me a hot dog?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony blinked and looked out the garage windows towards the mansion. &ldquo;Sure, ahh Jarvis will&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Edwin is busy making dinner for everyone. You might consider hiring him some extra help given there are so many of us staying here now.&rdquo;&nbsp;It must just have been a natural gift. Surely no other human could possibly deliver what was, in essence, a mild reprimand and make it sound like an honest suggestion with no blame attached.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Tony repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Mrs. Arbogast to bring some more people in. You really want a hot dog?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap tilted his head curiously. &ldquo;Unless they don&rsquo;t sell them anymore&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh no, they still do.&rdquo; Tony was sure they did, he&rsquo;d just never bought one before.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Then Tony, please buy me a real hot dog from a stand. Outside.&rdquo; The slightest tone of command had entered the even voice.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony calculated the time it would take to shower, change clothes, make his hair awesome and find some money. He reassessed based on the determined look on the Captain&rsquo;s face and came up with a clean t-shirt and no grease as his best possible option.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Give me five minutes to clean up.&rdquo; He was going to have to hit Bruce up for cash.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">A walk in the park for Tony Stark wasn&rsquo;t the same as it was for everyone else. Happy was with Pepper, so Tony now had Oakley and two other burly security guards, suspected SHEILD agents, trailing the requisite eight steps behind him. Captain America was also at his side, watching Tony pay for five hotdogs, two with onion, three without, thus the SHEILD guys were acting like blushing fan boys, more likely to taser their own asses than any would-be assassins.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Oakley did have Tony&rsquo;s briefcase though so the risk was minimal.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I think we could use more women.&rdquo; Steve said as he neatly tossed his balled-up paper napkin in a trash can fifteen feet away.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony grinned. &ldquo;Just about everything could use more women, but I guess you mean the team?&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap pushed his hands into the pockets of his army issue BDU pants. &ldquo;Not only just for our public image, but for a better work dynamic. We need more abilities that aren&rsquo;t just power or hand-to-hand combat focused, a scout for example, would be ideal. If Nick can find a dame with&hellip;dammit&hellip;I mean a <i>lady</i> with those skills we&rsquo;d be a lot more balanced.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Grin widening at Steve&rsquo;s verbal faux pas, Tony nodded. &ldquo;Definitely more superhero girls if you can find them. And don&rsquo;t worry too much about calling women &lsquo;dames&rsquo;, <i>you</i> they&rsquo;ll forgive.&rdquo; Because six foot of honest to god decency could work wonders with some members of the fairer sex.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Nick has files on several lady heroes. One is a Lieutenant Rambeau from New Orleans, she can &lsquo;convert her body to energy&rsquo;,&rdquo; Tony is sure Steve would have used air quotes if he&rsquo;d been born in the latter half of the twentieth century. &ldquo;Whatever <i>that</i> means. She&rsquo;s young, but I think we should have a conversation with her.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo; Tony agreed, finishing his own food.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;So you can come to New Orleans?&rdquo; Steve watched a small sparrow angrily begin to chirp at a butcher bird.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It took Tony a moment to make the conversational connection. &ldquo;Me? Oh no Captain. The recruiting thing is definitely not my strong suit. You know about the mess I made with Bruce after talking to that General? No.&rdquo; Tony would be adamant in the face of Steve&rsquo;s desire. He would. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The larger bird retreated from the furious aggression of a creature one third its size. Cap smiled then spun on his heel to walk backwards in front on Tony, all easy grace and perfect co-ordination.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Iron Man is the most famous Avenger.&rdquo; Tony snorted disbelievingly, not after the digital recording of Captain America&rsquo;s recovery had leaked onto YouTube he wasn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;You are. People knew you before you became a superhero and you live in this century.&rdquo; Steve face had a hopeful, almost pleading look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick my foot in my mouth and she&rsquo;ll never agree. Please?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">God help him. No wonder young men and women had offered their lives for their country with Steve Rogers looking at them like that. He could almost convince Tony he meant every word he&rsquo;d just uttered.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Take Natasha and Coulson.&rdquo; Tony countered. &ldquo;They won me over.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve&rsquo;s face said the many ways in which he didn&rsquo;t believe that sentence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need star power, we need Tony Stark.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony was already working on keeping his ego in check most days. Now he had Captain America telling him he was a star. Next would be Nick Fury buying him a beer.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Or maybe not.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Stopping, Tony crossed his arms over his chest and thought about it. He was sure Pepper and the ridiculously efficient PA they shared could organize the trip, maybe with a Stark Industries cover reason to be in Louisiana.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Okay. But if she&rsquo;s too overwhelmed by my awesome, don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.&rdquo; It <i>was</i> a joke but the Lieutenant could still refuse because of any number of reasons. Some of which might have to do with Tony.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Cap&rsquo;s smile put the early afternoon sun to shame. &ldquo;Everyone loves you or hates you,&rdquo; the mockery dripping from every word. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">That made Tony chuckle. &ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t know me well enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Tony was one hundred percent certain Steve&rsquo;s voice hadn&rsquo;t meant that to have the flirty edge it bore. He was smiling back, ready for some twenty-first century innuendo when Steve slapped a hand to his neck like he&rsquo;d been mosquito stung.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Take cover!&rdquo; Cap shouted, spinning on his heel. &ldquo;Oakley, sniper to the south. Get your men&hellip;to&hellip;move&hellip;&rdquo; His voice started to drift as he stumbled.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony lurched forward to catch him as Steve fell, the big man&rsquo;s weight pulling him to his knees in the warm, fresh-smelling grass. Gunfire broke out over them.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oakley, the case!&rdquo; He yelled, checking Cap&rsquo;s throat for a wound and finding a tiny metallic sliver. Tony snatched the dart from Steve&rsquo;s neck and looked desperately towards his bodyguards. Oakley was down, maybe dead, Tony&rsquo;s briefcase still cuffed to his wrist ten feet away.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even.&rdquo; The muzzle of a gun pressing into the back of his neck had Tony relax the spring he&rsquo;d been about to attempt. His guards were all crumpled piles of suit around him, briefcase out of reach, Captain America unconscious in his arms. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You guys fail at being ninjas you know. Like fifty people are recording this on their cell phones as we speak&hellip;&rdquo; Tony stopped talking as the gun moved over his shoulder to point at Steve. His wanted to put his hand over Cap&rsquo;s face protectively, like the flesh and bone could stop a bullet at this range. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; Tony took one lingering look at the man in his lap, saw the briefest flicker of an eyelid and thanked heaven for the super soldier serum and the metabolism it had granted Steve. Gently laying the blond head in the grass, Tony didn&rsquo;t resist as his wrists were cable-tied behind his back and he was pushed roughly into an unmarked van.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Steve would wake up soon with a monster headache, but at least he&rsquo;d wake up.<br /></span></p></lj-cut>"

Cold metal pressed to his temple, three points of fire beginning to bore their way towards his mind and Tony screamed out his helplessness and rage, hoping that the others would hear him. Hoping they&rsquo;d be in time.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><u><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">24 Hours Earlier.</span></u></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Iron Man circled the towing skyscraper, enjoying the aerial view of Manhattan on a clear day, knocking back the insects with repulsor shots and calculating the possibility of Thor accidentally frying his ass with lightning in the next thirty seconds.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Unlikely, Sir. We have enhanced the armor with the Ukona weather array mesh. It should resist all electrical emissions&hellip;&rdquo;</span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt""> JARVIS explained. Again.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah. But we never researched the difference between natural&hellip;&rdquo; Tony ducked to avoid a wasp the size of a bus,&rdquo; ...lightening and Mythical Norse God of Thunder Lightening. Take readings.&rdquo; He still couldn&rsquo;t get a view into the penthouse, but could imagine the battle going on inside. Romonoff would be felling guards like a particularly petite red-haired woodsman without the plaid. Clint was supposed to stay in the lobby, but being Clint wouldn&rsquo;t and the Captain&hellip;well, Tony wasn&rsquo;t going to dwell on the attractions of Captain America while dodging lightening and whatever those eight legged green things were that looked like something fatal from Australia.</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Taking all possible scans and readings on the electricity generated by the hammer, Sir. May I suggest that this battle has taken longer than projected and that the team inside the Wallenguard Building is meeting greater than expected resistance?&rdquo; </span></i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">There was just the slightest kernel of concern lacing the A.I&rsquo;s voice. Tony suspected he had a crush on the Black Widow.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Grinning he boosted around to the north face of the seemingly normal building and hovered outside the fifty-ninth floor windows.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;JARVIS, you can be as suggestive as you want.&rdquo; And considering he&rsquo;d been created by Tony Stark that was likely pretty damn suggestive. &ldquo;Still can&rsquo;t get past the funky windows?&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;No Sir. Satellite transmissions, infra-red all unable to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; Tony fired twin repulsors at the gleaming surface and watched toughened class rain down on the dozen startled women conducting an occult ritual within. &ldquo;Tell me they&rsquo;re the ones doing the bug thing and I didn&rsquo;t just interrupt a perfectly legal Wiccan get together.&rdquo;</span></p><p><i><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;You are safe from prosecution, Sir. They are indeed responsible for the &lsquo;bug thing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The billowing red cape in the corner of his eye had Tony adjusting his angle for wind shear as Thor pulled up beside him. &ldquo;The wasps are retreating.&rdquo; The massive blond informed him as the rest of the Avengers broke down the penthouse door. A red, white and blue figure began a kind of violent dance with the blood drenched cult leader. For a &lsquo;non-combative with supernatural powers&rsquo; the woman was doing remarkably well against the nigh unmatched hand-to-hand skill of Captain America. What Tony loathed to face in an Avengers training session was being demonstrably successful in the penthouse. Cap&rsquo;s sharp kick and two punches in quick succession had her almost running backwards, broken bones averted only by the man&rsquo;s need to subdue and what must be &lsquo;magic&rsquo; protection. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d hit a woman,&rdquo; Tony commented. He could target the rest of the sect, but Fury had insisted this mission have no fatalities and Iron Man wasn&rsquo;t great at pulling his punches, hence wasp dodging.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, too much the gentleman.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Thor watched for another few seconds. &ldquo;Our Captain is sworn to destroy evil; I do not think a softer form will deter him from his mission.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Given that the cult leader had just raked Cap&rsquo;s face with some razor sharp nails and Tony was pretty sure that was human entrails around her wrist, he was inclined to agree. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Romonoff hear you say &lsquo;softer&rsquo; or you&rsquo;ll lose some teeth. God or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">The battle continued. Thor&rsquo;s grip on his hammer tightening as their companions began to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo; Because yeah, shield to knees would hurt like a bitch. Blood stained mouth wide, robes askew the cult leader threw one last curse at Captain America and stumbled towards the windows Tony had just so recently shattered.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony wondered if he and Thor looked like a very ugly synchronized diving team as they hurtled to stop the death plunge going on before them. Latching onto an ankle, Iron Man pulled into a wide arc so he wouldn&rsquo;t break any bones and turned to see the rest of the cultists follow their leader out the forty story window. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Oh fuck me.&rdquo; Tony cursed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">*****</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony had allowed the Avengers Initiative six months, one year at the outside, before he became mind-numbingly bored with the whole idea. This was before SHEILD had allocated considerable sums and political favors to Stark Industries for Tony&rsquo;s &lsquo;consultations&rsquo;, some of these included tech upgrade requests, bleeding edge software development and Fury&rsquo;s request for &ldquo;a flying aircraft carrier, if it&rsquo;s not too much trouble&rdquo;. Near drowning in schematics and designs, Fury had then introduced him to the other superheroes and the increasing level of hotness each displayed.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Then there were the giant bugs.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Several hours after the cleanup at the Midtown office building, Tony nodded his thanks to Jarvis and pressed the iced drink to his forehead. Edwin Jarvis was a much a part of the Stark mansion in New York as the priceless antiques he so loved to collect. Tony considered them Jarvis&rsquo; property and despite objections had allocated a small fortune to the man to increase, maintain and curate the collection. Much like Pepper and her modern art thing, but with turned legs.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Can I get you something to eat Master Anthony?&rdquo; Jarvis the man was far more deferential than JARVIS the AI and Tony was almost glad he hadn&rsquo;t been able to reproduce the voice perfectly. Running away to the other side of the country, he hadn&rsquo;t the heart to steal the man from his home, so an artificial copy had been the answer. Tony was used to making his friends&hellip;literally. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">But whenever the Avengers were in New York, which was a lot, they stayed at the mansion under Jarvis&rsquo; dignified eye. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Thank you, no.&rdquo; Years of ingrained respect and love for the man gave Tony manners all but Rhodey were astonished to hear. &ldquo;I want to go back to L.A.&rdquo; He groused to Natasha. &ldquo;There are no suicide cults in Malibu, only suicide blondes.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Agent Romonoff didn&rsquo;t look up from the tablet she was typing her report onto. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going back next week for a shareholder meeting while we go to Paris.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">He glanced to Pepper for confirmation, realized Pepper was still in L.A. running Stark Industries, and dropped his forehead to his beautiful French polished dining table.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony didn&rsquo;t look up as Fury and Cap came in for the mission debrief, he&rsquo;d seen the deep gouges running along a perfect cheekbone as Iron Man ferried the cultists to the SHIELD team on the street. Captain America had shot him one frosty baby blue glare then returned to his discussion with the NYPD.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">If he was going to get his ass reamed by Steve Rogers, he&rsquo;d rather it be in a thousand count cotton sheet way than a &lsquo;you messed up, fella&rsquo; way.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Well done people.&rdquo; Smooth voice, New York native crossed with years in Europe. &ldquo;I think we can call this one a success despite&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Despite genius over there blowing out a window so the crazy chicks could kill themselves.&rdquo; Clint Barton wasn&rsquo;t a fan of Tony. The feeling was mutual. Tony suspected both of them being shot down by Natasha within a week probably had something to do with it&hellip;as well as twin man-crushes on Cap.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;We caught them all.&rdquo; Tony pointed out, lifting up to look at the archer.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">It really wasn&rsquo;t fair on his libido that all the superheroes in the Avengers were blistering hot blonds and one deadly red-head. He&rsquo;d been having enough trouble keeping his hands off Rhodey and Pepper.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">God, he really needed to get laid.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;Iron Man was attempting to discover if your part of the mission was going according to plan.&rdquo; Thor spoke concisely, arms crossed over his chest. &ldquo;The sorceries enacted were stopping the communication devices and the plague of insects unrelenting. Iron Man&rsquo;s action distracted the cult leader sufficiently to allow you to enter the sanctum and caused the wasps to retreat.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">Tony saw the surprised looks on Clint and Natasha&rsquo;s faces and caught the twitch of a smile from Cap.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-size: 10pt"">&ldquo;What he said.&rdquo; Tony pointed at Thor.<br /></span></p></lj-cut>"

Molly&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">His daughter stood up and glided to her father&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Please get your atlas dear,&rdquo; Angela asked with a smattering of warmth.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;And the red folder of drawings, I think he&rsquo;s in them.&rdquo; Parkman added.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">For the tenth time that week, Gabriel forced down the urge to tear open their heads and take what he needed. Relying on others was so&hellip;slow. But he released Parkman&rsquo;s clothing and directed a sneer at the various people who visibly relaxed. Like they could have stopped him anyway.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The red folder flew into his hands the moment Molly returned. The young woman took this in stride, quickly sitting with a map of the US in her lap and a drawing pin held in her delicate fingers.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;If<i> he </i>sees Molly&hellip;&rdquo; Mohinder warned.

They were all drawings of Peter. The moment the man had walked through their front door, the fight yesterday afternoon and god help them, an unfamiliar place where Peter stood barefoot, a chain at one slim ankle, surrounded by dark figures that exuded lust and fear. Relegating that image to be deciphered and avenged later, Gabriel&rsquo;s eyes fell on something so familiar he knew it had to be what Parkman was looking for.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;This one.&rdquo; He dropped the sketch into the blind man&rsquo;s hands and waited for confirmation, eyes on the girl.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Nathan asked voice tight with worry. &ldquo;That could be anytime&hellip;anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Parkman ran his fingertips over the Braille embedded at the corner. &ldquo;This is the one, he&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The sketch showed Peter, bleeding and injured, standing in a luxurious hotel room. To his left were the crumpled forms of men in paramilitary clothes, to his right a dozen more all with laser sights targeting the slender man. Directly in front of the nurse a shadowy, monstrous figure lurked, eight long arms seeming to reach forward intent on smothering Peter. &nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;That could be ten years from now. &ldquo; Nathan argued.

All the damage his body had taken was starting to take a toll on him. Unlike his niece, Peter could still feel the pain of every wound inflicted upon him and the constant healing was exhausting. Not to mention the multiple use of his powers that up until now he hadn&rsquo;t thought possible.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Two hours ago he&rsquo;d landed in Washington. The Spider was based in the capital city, hidden in some clandestine place that was far removed from what was left of America&rsquo;s government. Knowing where to start, Peter kept the warmth of Gabriel&rsquo;s arms close to his heart and accosted the first FedMarshal he&rsquo;d seen. Telekinesis had frozen the woman in the act of opening a door, telepathy had forced its way into her brain and sorted through her memories to see who her superior was. He&rsquo;d been lucky. Davina Rourke was a senior Marshal and had made several direct reports to Danko at an office that looked somewhat like a library. Putting her to sleep in a comfortable chair, Peter had found the nearest trash can and was violently ill.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Now he could add mind-rape to the growing list of his sins.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Wiping his mouth, Peter had teleported to the library/office and faked his way to the commander&rsquo;s presence. Another mental attack showed that the FedMarshals were in disarray after Gabriel&rsquo;s killing of Danko and there were a dozen meetings and crisis talks scheduled for the rest of the week. One of them was with a man the commander only knew as Roberts. Roberts&rsquo; office was in Fairfax, less than ten minutes from the library.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter walked there to try and clear his head a little.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It didn&rsquo;t work.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The delicious, needed, lustful passion he had left behind contrasted horribly with what he was doing and what he was planning to do. It bothered Peter so much that he hesitated out the front of Robert&rsquo;s office. An old campaign building that reminded him of Nathan&rsquo;s with such instant clarity that it felt like a punch to the gut. Swallowing hard Peter thought of Claire and baby Noah and Ethan and Luke and Lyle and Monica and Micah and Molly and&hellip;.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter quietly opened the door and attacked the people within.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Roberts had never seen or met the Spider. But he&rsquo;d once been in a FedMarshal car that dropped Danko off to high level talks. The limousine had rolled to halt in front of a hotel named The Clarion on Longreach Drive.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">With a sorrowful glance at the sleeping forms around him, Peter concentrated on the image he&rsquo;d stolen and &lsquo;ported himself to the front door.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">*****</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The doorman had shot him three times with a hand gun. Cursing his own idiocy at appearing visibly, Peter had tossed the gun into the head of the first FedMarshal to burst into the street and tossed the doorman at the head of the second.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It had gone downhill from there.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The real problem was, Peter thought as he healed a hand shattered by a shotgun round, was that he didn&rsquo;t want to kill anyone. Well. He wanted to kill the Spider, but the people who worked for him were meant for an all-but destroyed justice system and besides, Peter had enough blood on his conscience to last a lifetime.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">None of it really mattered.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Keeping the humans alive was one thing, it was the bloody &lsquo;specials&rsquo; that were really fucking up his plan. Had the Spider collected everyone with an energy power for god&rsquo;s sake? Dodging and throwing most of it back at its sender was very risky. Most weren&rsquo;t immune to their own powers and the look on that man&rsquo;s face as poison gas surrounded him made Peter want to find a respirator and do what he&rsquo;d been trained for all those years.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Stupid really, but then Peter had never stopped wanting to save people.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The hardest part was keeping track of the new abilities he was gaining. The gas was revolting and made his mouth taste like rotten eggs, while the fire reminded him too much of Ted Sprague and dying explosively at two thousand feet in the air.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">In the end, none of it mattered.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter reached the thirtieth floor surrounded by red alarm klaxons and a sputtering electrical system, the tingle of the hard jolt he received still pinching his nerves like a bitch. He didn&rsquo;t have time to put his shoulder back into its socket, but the ligaments weren&rsquo;t screaming at him anymore. There was blood in his eyes, his mouth and he&rsquo;d lost his shoes to that crazy superglue floor.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It didn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Pulling the warm black coat tighter around him, Peter smiled at the feel of the rich red satin lining and threw Gabriel&rsquo;s power at the door.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It shattered into a hundred pieces.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">*****</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Ahhh, I knew it was you Peter.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The voice that originated from the skeletal figure on the throne-like armchair brought bile to Peter&rsquo;s throat.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&lsquo;Oh you bastard Claude&rsquo;</i>, he thought with a sick smile. &lsquo;<i>You knew all along.&rsquo;</i> Daddy fucking long-legs indeed.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Never could surprise you, could I Dad?&rdquo; Peter asked Arthur Petrelli as he dropped three guards to the floor with a wave of Gabriel&rsquo;s power.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Four bullets ripped into his back and buttocks, ruining the fine coat even more and drawing an involuntary grunt of agony from Peter. It was like a fucking Greek tragedy, his <i>father</i> for heaven&rsquo;s sake. It all clicked into place, the footsteps in the woods, the power to force Peter forward in time, stolen from Hiro all those years ago. One of only three people in the world with multiple abilities plus a penchant for tyranny and destruction of his own kind.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It was his father. Angela and Nathan had been battling Arthur for five years and never even knew it was their own flesh and blood.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">God, what a messed up family he had.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask why, but you&rsquo;d probably say it was for our own good and that&rsquo;s bullshit.&rdquo; Peter observed, no longer really feeling anything. He was too drained by the battles, the pain and the absolute shock of this last, awful revelation. Arthur, aged beyond human by death and madness raised a gnarled hand as if asking for Peter&rsquo;s in friendship.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Elle&rsquo;s electricity ripped into Peter, drawing a scream and forcing him to his knees.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Or it would have, but for the strong arm at his waist and the scent of pine and almonds that surrounded him.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&ldquo;Gabriel.&rdquo;</i> Peter gasped into the warm skin at his lover&rsquo;s neck.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;This is like the final battle in Star Wars.&rdquo; Hiro Nakamura commented before vanishing to reappear with Monica and Mohinder at his side.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I kill you?&rdquo; Gabriel accused.

Fortunately Monroe&rsquo;s power allowed me to heal the moment the bullet was removed.&rdquo; The deep voice hadn&rsquo;t changed at all, nor the spectacular control of abilities that Mohinder had likely only dreamed existed. It was taking everything in Gabriel and Peter combined to keep him at bay.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;God! <i>Arthur.</i>&rdquo; Angela&rsquo;s voice was stripped bare. Peter wondered at Hiro&rsquo;s sanity for bringing her here, her power was to dream for fuck&rsquo;s sake. But then the reason became obvious, the person who could affect his father the most, could throw him off his attacks for a critical moment was the small beautiful lady now walking towards the far end of the room.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Ahh my love, you have come to join me at last.&rdquo; The voice was that of a young suitor, not the undead dictator they all wanted destroyed. Peter glanced away from a sunburst of power, his eyes coming to rest on a slumped figure near Arthur&rsquo;s chair.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I thought <i>my</i> father was insane.&rdquo; Gabriel muttered as he tossed a door at the mountain of a man who was trying to pound Monica into the floor.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Get me closer,&rdquo; Peter whispered into the warm skin at Gabriel&rsquo;s throat. He was almost completely healed, the respite his friends had granted doing wonders. But the overtaxing of his powers was a wrenching drain that wouldn&rsquo;t stop. Keeping a shield before Angela and throwing an occasional bolt to protect Claire as she bodily threw herself between gunfire and her grandmother was pulling at his dwindling reserves.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Drawing Peter closer to his lean, gorgeous form, Gabriel carefully walked them towards the armchair via the doorway to the now obliterated bathroom. Keeping his eyes on the body near the wall, Peter listened to his mother, listened to the battle and most of all listened to the pulse of the man at his side.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to let me go.&rdquo; He instructed as they inched forward, hellfire and glory raging around them.

It was bitterly cold this late in the evening with only a t-shirt, but he had other things to think about than frostbite. The giant childish sulk he currently indulged in was one, the stupid hurt he felt at his family&rsquo;s betrayal was another and finally the worst, the unmistakable truth behind Sylar&rsquo;s words.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He wanted to go home. Pitiful and sad as it sounded, Peter desperately wanted to go back to his own time. Even if it was to the hatred in Nathan&rsquo;s eyes, cool manipulation from his mother and Claire&rsquo;s youthful innocence slowly being tarnished by darkness. It was a terrible thing that his family were more loving here in an apocalyptic future than they&rsquo;d ever been when Peter was around.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">But the one way he could go back and make everything right was currently unavailable to him. Because of the god-damned Spider and his FedMarshal drones, Peter couldn&rsquo;t time travel, couldn&rsquo;t go back and fix his family. With the knowledge he had now, Peter could forestall Nathan&rsquo;s deal with Danko, could stop the President from declaring them all terrorists and he could save Sylar. He&rsquo;d drag the killer to Matt by his hair if he had to, to get the hunger stopped and allow the human being within to see the light.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He had to get Hiro&rsquo;s power back. Peter had to end the Spider and fix this fucked-up place once and for all.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">After several hours in the air, Peter&rsquo;s eyes were itchy dry despite the moisture around him. All the wounds from the fight with Sylar long healed, except for the ones on his heart. They might take longer than a sabbatical in the clouds. As the last of the daylight bled into darkness, Peter determined his course of action and descended towards the mansion. He wanted to talk to Claire. She, of all his family, would tell him the straight unvarnished truth. Peter had looked down the barrel of a gun in her small hand and still trusted her.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter glided easily through his open bedroom window and quickly pulled off his shoes. He needed a hot shower, a conversation with his niece, five hours of sleep and then he&rsquo;d leave. The illuminated lamp by his bedside stilled the fingers on his belt. The man seated in the armchair caused Peter&rsquo;s spine to stiffen in caution.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re worried.&rdquo; The velvet voice was neutral, free of the hate and scorn that had infused it earlier.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter concentrated. In his mental and audible voice he said,</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&lsquo;Matt, I&rsquo;m back and fine.

Please tell them to stay away.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A pointed glare towards the seated man then the door while Peter pulled his black &lsquo;mission&rsquo; clothes from his cupboard.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Chin cupped in his palm, long fingers curled up to his cheek, Sylar spoke casually, as if he hadn&rsquo;t drilled an electric hole through Peter&rsquo;s chest scant hours before.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a hard lesson for me to understand how completely oblivious you actually are.&rdquo; The velvet voice was oddly gentle, but Peter barely noticed it over the criticism. Peter hardly needed another set of insults to add to the damage his ego had already taken at this man&rsquo;s hands.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m such a failure.&rdquo; He snarled.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar seemed to repress an eye roll through sheer force of will.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I <i>meant</i>, before you react like a snake and fang me to death, I realised today you don&rsquo;t even have any kind of clue what you do to me.&rdquo; A careless gesture with his free hand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Blinking at the obscure statement, Peter shook his head to clear some emotional cobwebs.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo; He responded quickly. &ldquo;I just wanted you to stop being an asshole to the people who love you.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A long-suffering sigh issued from that handsome mouth. Peter tried to divert himself from paying attention with his completely logical rage. It couldn&rsquo;t quite take, what with Sylar rising to his feet and stalking over to Peter like a big, sexy hunting cat. Hands caught his shoulders, a strong grip that pulled them dangerously close together. A bump of groin to groin so Peter could feel the unmistakable evidence of the other&rsquo;s arousal.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;<i>This</i> is what you do to me.&rdquo; Lips lowered to hover light as gossamer just above his.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter was immediately torn. On one hand he wanted to punch the fucker in the face for all the emotional rings he&rsquo;d been running Peter through, on the other hand Sylar was <i>right there</i> inches away, his body stealing the last of the night chill from Peter&rsquo;s skin and those lips so very close&hellip;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t just fix everything between us by agreeing we want to fuck.&rdquo; There was still an edge in Peter&rsquo;s voice, one caused by the gutting pain he&rsquo;d experienced at this man&rsquo;s hands.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Lids lifted and the sudden heat in the midnight gaze almost stole the last of his resistance.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;ll stop me wanting to burn little holes in your skin just so I can keep your attention fixed completely&hellip;&rdquo; again the wicked mouth made a gentle pass, &ldquo;&hellip;on me.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">With herculean effort, Peter pulled his face back fractionally. &ldquo;Apologise for being an asshole.&rdquo; He ordered, suppressing a primal urge to just drop and bare his neck.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A slight smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was an asshole to everyone and I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; the whispering mouth moved closer and this time Peter couldn&rsquo;t even form a thought of denial. &ldquo;&hellip;I took it out on you.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The intrinsic fairness that was welded to his DNA had Peter saying softly, &ldquo;It was much my fault as&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The kiss that stole his words shook Peter to his very core. Such an indecent, talented mouth Sylar possessed and one intent on addicting Peter to it&rsquo;s every move and push.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Reaching up to lace his fingers through the thick hair, Peter pulled Sylar in closer, pressing them together full length and arching his chest against that delicious body. Sylar 's sudden deep growl sent shivers down Peter's spine despite the warmth of the room. The&nbsp;sensuous mouth&nbsp;locked on his was firm and wet, sliding along Peter's so perfectly.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Their tongues duelled for several seconds, before allowing exploration of teeth and lips. Peter now felt like he was burning from the inside, going up in Ted&rsquo;s flames and&nbsp;Sylar a solid island of cool to drown in. Not only was he solid, but that iron erection from earlier had now an eager companion in Peter&rsquo;s denim covered groin. He had been half hard already just from the other&rsquo;s presence in his room and the smoky velvet voice curling around him. Now Peter&rsquo;s cock felt like iron inside the prison of his clothes. On and on the kisses continued, dragging the breath out of him, turning his bones to jelly and opening a deep yawning pit of need inside his heart and his body.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Peter never wanted to fuck so badly in his life. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">It seemed Sylar agreed because just as Peter pressed in, trying to force himself closer, the other man curved two hands under Peter&rsquo;s ass and lifted like he was a lightweight. Wrapping his legs around Sylar&rsquo;s hips, Peter groaned into their locked mouths at the almost painful press of his erection against another. Somewhere in the back of his head he knew Sylar didn&rsquo;t have superior strength and felt a definite buzz of heat at the human muscle his soon-to-be lover had just displayed.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 0cm"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Using his weight and a little bit of power, Peter pushed them backwards until the back of Sylar&rsquo;s knees hit the bed. Hmmm. Exactly where he wanted to be, sitting astride Sylar&rsquo;s lap, tousling that perfect hair while kissing so deep and needy that he thought he never may stop.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">A few quick acrobatic movements had Sylar coatless and pressed back into the headboard, while Peter dislodged their shoes and removed shirts as quickly as possible. Sylar was hardly passive, drawing a gasp as Peter&rsquo;s jaw and throat were tormented with lips and tongue, long fingers pulling at the buttons of his jeans then delving inside to curl and stroke the satin flesh within.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Telekinesis wielded by either of them or both, helpfully removed at the last of their clothes; the power an eager manifestation of their mutual desire to be absolutely, completely naked. Glorious skin finally glided against skin, so wickedly warm together that Peter could see a full body massage in the future somewhere. Just those fingers on him was turning Peter on so completely, he wanted to flat out beg Sylarl to take him any way he wanted. When his length was released he gave a great long shuddering sigh. One that quickly turned into a shudder of need as the hands crept around and delved gently at his ass. Their lips parted on a hiss of pleasure. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; the word was almost lost in Peter&rsquo;s heightened breathing, but the want was plain and absolute.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">He purred into that striking, handsome face, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t I may just have to force you.&rdquo; </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Sylar&rsquo;s sudden sensual chuckle caused a new fizzle of arousal to hit Peter. He had never heard the man issue such a carefree and downright <i>dirty </i>sound before.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;One day.&rdquo; The former killer vowed, passion laced through the dark promise of his voice.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">With a clench of thigh muscles Peter sat higher, raking his hands once again through the thick chocolate hair that had flicked so teasingly at his skin during those bruise rending kisses. Smashing his lips almost clumsily against Sylar&rsquo;s, Peter curled his hand around the length nudging at his buttocks, adoring its satin feel and size. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">The first brush of Sylar's fingers across his opening sent tingles, like tiny electric shocks, up his spine from his ass to his skull. In retaliation Peter tightened his fingers around Sylar's sex and gently rubbed his palm across the silken head. He almost wanted to slide lower and swallow Sylar deep down into his throat, but another part of his body needed that hot hard shaft even more. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">As Sylar's talented fingers moved and stretched him, Peter sunk his teeth into his lower lip to stifle the terribly uncontrolled moan threatening to escape him. Eventually the tormenting touches became too much and Peter pulled back and away from their sensual touch. He frankly didn't care if he was <i>ready</i> because he wanted Sylar in him. Right. Now. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Catching two handfuls of that thick hair, Peter pressed his body against Sylar&rsquo;s in a blatant invitation.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Now. Now.

But beneath his ragged begging, Peter heard the slight hitch in the other man&rsquo;s breathing and knew that his soon-to-be lover was walking a knife edge of control even more volatile than his own. He wanted to look into those eyes as he came, watch the man's face when they made love for the first time. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">The first press of Sylar's hardness inside him had Peter responding instinctively, exhaling&nbsp;and relaxing as he slowly surrendered his body. It burned a little and the ache was intense but&nbsp;Peter felt the friction turn to a riot of bliss as inch by solid inch pressed its way inside him. Peter arched his back and canted his hips to return the pressure. A hand tightened at the base of his skull and Peter could see the same fierce pleasure fill the midnight eyes that gazed with steady control into his own. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Letting gravity finally win, Peter sank all the way down, feeling Sylar slide in impossibly deeper. He gasped at the nascent burn, eyelids fluttering closed, biting his lip at the overwhelming pleasure. The flesh tormented by teeth only for a second as with a sharp pull forwards his lover broke the connection with his tongue, piercing Peter twice both ass and mouth, holding and owning.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter began a slow, sensual dance, the lift and pull of his hips drawing the hard flesh in and out of him. Rocking them together in a simply glide dictated by need and gasped murmurs of &ldquo;yes&hellip;right there&hellip;you..&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Long seconds passed as Peter worked them closer to the edge, his gaze locked on the bitter chocolate ones that he&rsquo;d never think of as cold again. Hands braced on Sylar&rsquo;s shoulders for balance, Peter lost all thought to the pleasure beginning to course from his ass to his cock.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">In one smooth motion his wrists were engulfed by Sylar&rsquo;s longer hands. In a&nbsp;move reminiscent of battle, Peter saw the wall and ceiling spin by in a blur, then was bouncing slightly on the thick mattress, Sylar's taller, delicious body pressing him even deeper into the comfortable softness. Now Peter was caught between the hot, hard body of his lover, still buried deep inside him and the bed. Looking up into Sylar&rsquo;s deep gaze, he couldn't help the challenge he threw up with only his eyes. Peter was in all kinds of luck as the challenge was answered, sweet, warm breath caressed his cheek and ear, sending wonderful shivers across the sensitive skin at his throat. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;You&hellip;are&hellip;&rdquo; Sylar&rsquo;s was like dark honey they way it curled and sashayed around them.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Hmm...?&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s gaze now as he looked at the handsome face, high cheekbones flushed, lips brilliant from desperate, needy kisses.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;</i> A single perfect thrust.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A full-body shudder had Peter&rsquo;s eyes closing, his fingers scoring desperate nail marks down the smooth skin over Sylar&rsquo;s back. When he had the breath to speak he rasped, &ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; But the vital movements didn&rsquo;t start, instead long fingers embedded in his hair and warm lips hovered butterfly soft over his own.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Open your eyes.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter looked into bitter chocolate touched by gold.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Say my name.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Lips moist from their duelling mouths, Peter tried to pull his brain online.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Sy&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A hard punishing kiss and the taste of copper on his tongue, fingers rough, collecting dark strands and small pulls of pain. Released after long seconds, Peter looked up again at saw the question repeated. For a foolish, lost moment he wondered at what he was supposed to say. But eventually he saw past the long, muscled form atop his own, past the handsome face, wicked mouth and beautiful hard cock pushed to the hilt in his body. A slow breath in and god help him, Peter had never been this obedient with anyone, not even his family, but&hellip;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Looking up through his lashes, he allowed the sheer eroticism of what they were doing, what was being done to him and by whom fill his gaze.

Nothing slow and sexy any more. All control lost, grasping hands, biting mouths, they pushed hard against each other in a desperate need to reach perfection.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter was burning up from inside and out. The fingers stroking his cock in time with the hard iron inside him, meant Peter was revelling in every single contact with Gabriel&rsquo;s skin. &nbsp;His orgasm was bubbling up to his knee caps right about the time his lover started chanting his name. A hot, feverish hum of want, want, want. Peter gave a moment's thought, a moment was about as much as he was capable of in this position, to trying to suppress the wild exhilaration about to blow his head off. But he couldn't and didn&rsquo;t want to suppress anything around Gabriel, not anymore.</p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Peter wasn't coherent enough to wonder if Gabriel was encouraged by his desperate, needy moans, he was too busy feeling and dying and letting that burn run from his thighs to his brain. The hard length slid into him again and again, stretching him, sending his nerves alight; Gabriel's hand stroked and caressed his cock until Peter's eyes rolled back in his head. </span></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Peter almost stopped breathing. The wildfire had taken him over, stealing his voice and rendering him&nbsp;a creature of sensation. Peter&rsquo;s climax bolted out of him, causing the muscles in his body to spasm to an almost painful degree. Desperately he held onto Gabriel's hair, locking his gaze with dark eyes almost inhuman at the moment of ecstasy. The growling, broken voice in his ear sending him to a white-hot room of instant blistering pleasure. </span></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">He had no voice, but his lips shaped one word.</span></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">Gabriel.</span></i></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">*****</span></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Peter was just drifting. Kind of like flying or floating down from a cliff, light as a feather. Muscles that were almost but not quite sore, the sweet, peaceful lassitude engulfing him was better than any drug. He'd just had the best orgasm of his adult life. </span></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Reality eventually penetrated Peter&rsquo;s happy little zone out. Gabriel's name still on his lips and his lover still buried deep inside him.</span></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Blinking slowly, Peter looked into the handsome face pressed into the pillow and registered the magnificent satisfaction that radiated outwards and seemed to haze the room around them. Gabriel had graced his jaw and neck with awesome, possessive kisses just five seconds ago, but Peter had been so high, his body had acquiesced while his mind hadn't really noticed.</span></p><p style=""margin: 5pt 34.6pt 5pt 45pt""><span style=""color: windowtext"">Reaching languid arms up to bury his fingers in thick dark hair, Peter tugged until he could kiss his new lover back. Softly blending drugged kisses with shifting limbs they arranged themselves into a more comfortable position, legs entangled, Peter&rsquo;s cheek resting on one broad smooth shoulder. </span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&lsquo;You&rsquo;re forgiven.&rdquo; He murmured cheekily, thinking off the small lamp and plunging them into darkness.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A low rumble of laughter deep within the chest pressed close. &ldquo;I see&hellip;so the next time we fight, we make up in the same way?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sudden sadness took Peter&rsquo;s breath momentarily, but he forced it away, enveloping himself with the rightness of the moment.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;agreed.&rdquo; Closing his eyes, he breathed in that deeply enticing scent of pine and almonds.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">But between one breath and the next, Peter fell asleep.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">*****</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Tying his shoes, Peter took one last longing glance around his room and stood up. The mild fall weather was slowly declining towards a chilly winter and he&rsquo;d need more than just a sweater where he was going. Stalled on his way to the wardrobe, Peter&rsquo;s heart gave a sudden lurch as he saw Gabriel shift in his sleep.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Like some kind of erotic photograph that Peter had hidden under this same bed during high school, his new lover was a studied contrast of darkness and light. The crisp white sheets lay lovingly along long muscled limbs, lean, tanned back just begging to be touched and a darkly stubbled handsome face pressed comfortably into the pillows.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Walking closer, Peter took a mental snapshot and re-organised the list of his most treasured memories in the back of his mind. Waking up warm and loved with Gabriel was now the flat out best thing that had ever happened to him, beyond even the power that had both enhanced and ruined his life.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">So gently as to take no risk of waking the other man, Peter traced one fingertip along the knuckles of lightly curled fingers.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He whispered.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The room didn&rsquo;t answer as Peter leapt into the sky.</p></lj-cut>"

His mother had seemed to know what they had done which brought up the possibility that she dreamed him almost making out with Sylar in the lab. Gaining an instant headache from the idea, Peter smiled in a completely unconvincing way and prayed she hadn&rsquo;t mentioned anything to Nathan.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Fortunately or unfortunately his brother had other concerns. Namely the intelligence Micah and the team had recovered indicated that Danko had been conducting human testing with the serum for the last three days and there were already several &lsquo;terminations&rsquo; listed in the reports. This information caused such a look of ice-cold rage to become Sylar&rsquo;s permanent expression and immediately doused any idea of resuming where they had left off on the mission.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Refusing to admit he was disappointed and telling himself to get in the right head space, it was Peter who discovered they&rsquo;d lost some lambs.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Near midnight had Peter taking his turn to collect coffee for everyone in Nathan&rsquo;s den. It was a war council of sorts, partly planning the mission to rescue the test subjects, partly a continuous argument with no end in sight. Peter had been playing mediator, alternatively calming angry voices and soothing jangled nerves. Personally he thought they should just ask Molly to find any of the special&rsquo;s they knew had been taken and then go rescue them.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It was never that easy apparently. Like Maury Parkman before him, the Spider could tell when Molly used her ability and had almost found the sanctuary several times in recent years. Thus the young woman&rsquo;s gift was used only in times of dire emergency. Matt and Sylar were in the midst of a verbal battle defining whether this was a &lsquo;dire&rsquo; enough situation.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Watching the hideously expensive coffee machine begin to chug and burble, Peter wandered into the lower lounge and saw Monica absorbed in an action movie. Surprised at the lack of youthful testosterone that usually flowed in the beautiful woman&rsquo;s wake, the nurse climbed the stairs to the boys&rsquo; bedroom.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Not there.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Nor were they in the games room, other bedrooms, backyard, and garage or on the tennis court.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Coming back into the den with his heart racing and no coffee, Peter interrupted Noah&rsquo;s words by asking in a voice close to panic.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Has anyone seen Ethan, Luke or Lyle? They&rsquo;re not in the house.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Lyle?&rdquo; Claire sounded frightened in a way the invulnerable woman never was for herself.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;They went for food hours ago.&rdquo; Angela told them, standing with her hands clutching each other white knuckled. &ldquo;Did they come back?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;No-one has seen them since.&rdquo; Peter looked to Noah with sympathy. Lyle was his youngest child. The man had used a lifetime of worry over his magnificent daughter. It was God&rsquo;s cruel joke to threaten the one that should have been easier to keep safe.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Ethan&rsquo;s angry.&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s voice brought them to silence. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s somewhere familiar, it scares him and he hates it.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter felt nausea twist in his gut. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been caught. Ethan knows the FedMarshal holding cells.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Matt stood sharply and looked directly at Sylar as if his eyes could perceive the man.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Danko.&rdquo; Not a flicker of emotion touched the strong handsome face of the man before him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re still in New York. Luke&rsquo;s seen Danko, he&rsquo;s&hellip; he&rsquo;s screaming in his head for Gabriel to help him.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar closed his eyes and took one long deep breath.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Nathan threw open a folder on his desk. &ldquo;They must be at the main facility on Ellis Island. It&rsquo;s impenetrable even if Hiro teleported&hellip;&rdquo; His words tailed off as Sylar opened his eyes.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Even Peter took a breath at what he saw there.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Taking all his courage, Peter walked forward and caught the killer&rsquo;s attention with a gentle hand to the shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The dark eyes that looked down into his belonged to a murderer that had been dead for three years.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Blocking out the protestations around him, Peter concentrated on the times he&rsquo;d seen Ellis from ferries and bridges.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Cool wind threw his hair into his eyes and raised a shiver down his spine. Sylar was unfazed by the chill, eyes on the buildings that covered the small island.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Do you want me to get the others?&rdquo; Peter raised his voice to be heard over the waves.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar didn&rsquo;t even glance at him, just started walking towards the high stone walls with determination a Sherman tank would envy.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that as a no.&rdquo; Peter wrapped his arms around himself and trotted to keep up. He wanted to get Ethan out of this place. Away from the grey clinical walls, anonymous prison clothing and likely maiming by FedMarshal guards. The boys shouldn&rsquo;t be here, they were too young to be part of the war yet. They should be at the mansion, eating Sandra&rsquo;s cooking like they&rsquo;re stomaches were bottomless pits and flirting badly with the pretty woman.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Not subject to needles that could render them &lsquo;terminated&rsquo; by their own fucking government.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar&rsquo;s plan seemed to be &lsquo;destroy anything or anyone between them and the boys&rsquo;. Peter was fine with that as long as no one got killed just for being there.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I need you.&rdquo; Sylar gritted out, the velvet voice almost ice-cold with rage.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter didn&rsquo;t even think of misunderstanding that statement. He simply drew on his most powerful memories of Sylar, looked directly into the man&rsquo;s handsome, determined face and joined his telekinesis to its true master.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Combined, their power was earth shattering.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">An eight foot area of the concrete walls bowed out for a split second and then exploded. Within the resultant shower of dust, they could hear the beginning of an alarm that pierced their ears with its sharp call. Two guards fell from the nearest tower, their descent only slowed from deadly to fractures at the last moment by Peter&rsquo;s quick reflexes. Making it his mission to shove away and knock out the guards that came near them so they wouldn&rsquo;t be ripped apart or melted, Peter kept to Gabriel&rsquo;s heels and hoped they&rsquo;d get to the cells before they saw Danko.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">No such luck.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">They were all in the same place. A huge aircraft hanger of some kind with the left sectioned off into wire cells and the right a large medical area with gurneys and white coated technicians.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;They had already finished it.&rdquo; Peter realised as he saw the vials of serum filling shelf after shelf of freezer units.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar suddenly grinned. &ldquo;They kept the security with the serum. We were distracted by the lab so we wouldn&rsquo;t notice they were rounding up even more people.&rdquo; A wave of his hand and a dozen vials exploded.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter flinched, his eyes falling on the cells and the cowering people within.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Get them out Peter, get them home.&rdquo; Angry eyes found a figure at the centre of the massing guards. A short, slight man, balding with deep-set insomniac eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be having some Me time.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter hesitated for a moment. Sylar had committed himself to his sentence with one hundred percent devotion. This would undo a lot of the ground he&rsquo;d gained with the others. But some small part of Peter understood. The man ordering the hail of gunfire that showered them but failed to touch had imprisoned Gabriel in a facility just like this. Had tortured him until the killer had thrown himself on the dubious mercy of his enemies rather than go on living another day.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Justice might finally be served today.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter walked over to the cages. His telekinesis was so intertwined with Sylar&rsquo;s that the few pushes he could manage wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to free the prisoners. So with a combination of Mohinder&rsquo;s strength and Ethan&rsquo;s acid tongue Peter destroyed every door he could see.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Fucking A, I knew you&rsquo;d come!&rdquo; Ethan yelled over the chaos shattering the building around them. &ldquo;I told that asshole &lsquo;Peter and Gabriel are going to fry this place when they get here.&rsquo; I knew you&rsquo;d <i>both</i> come.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter herded all the captives together and started to lead them in a group to the walls and beach beyond. He would likely sprain something teleporting them all to the mansion, and Sylar would loose the extra boost Peter was giving him, but at least they&rsquo;d be&hellip;.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; Lyle yelled in exultation, eyes on a helicopter that roared over the shattered walls.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&lsquo;How in hell did Noah get a helicopter so fast?&rsquo;</i> Peter wondered incredulously, before pushing the boys towards it.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Hiro was suddenly at his side, a warm smile on his kind face before he took the hands of two prisoners and vanished.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">His mission now in the hands of others, Peter ran back towards the building where Sylar was making a mess of the military. It no longer had a roof and the walls were going to meet the earth in a matter of minutes.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Realising that he hadn&rsquo;t seen Luke amongst the prisoners, Peter scanned the battlefield and found the boy, crouched behind Sylar. Completely protected by the strongest telekinetic on the planet. Continuing to merge that same power, although used with less finesse, with its owner&rsquo;s, the nurse reached their side and grabbed Luke&rsquo;s hand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;We have to go!&rdquo; he yelled over the conflagration around them.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Luke violently shook his head. &ldquo;Not until that fucker is dead!&rdquo; he screamed back.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter leaned around Sylar to see Danko, somehow still alive amidst the killer&rsquo;s fury and wondered at the protections that layered the FedMarshal leader.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;This is boring.&rdquo; Sylar said calmly, his voice audible amongst the din. &ldquo;Time for you to die.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">With a suddenness that was likely planned, every man surrounding Danko dropped their guns and began writhing in pain at his feet.

Peter mourned for those first tentative steps to friendship, let alone the insane chance of something sexual between them. He couldn&rsquo;t tell if it had been the merging of their power or Danko&rsquo;s death, but Sylar had turned into a first class bastard and this time, it wasn&rsquo;t Peter&rsquo;s fault.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The former killer snarled at everyone, even the protected Molly wasn&rsquo;t immune to Sylar&rsquo;s bad humour. During conversations where missions were discussed, he would disparage Nathan&rsquo;s plans, insult Bennet until the man was ready empty a clip into his head and mock Hiro so much he&rsquo;d leave shrouded in puzzled hurt. Peter suspected that Sylar was just pissed off with the world because they had all been played. Some of the most powerful and versatile &lsquo;specials&rsquo; in existence and they had missed Danko&rsquo;s sinister plan, the deaths of everyone in custody the result of their arrogance.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">But still, it wasn&rsquo;t really anyone&rsquo;s fault, not Nathan&rsquo;s, not Bennet&rsquo;s and certainly not Sylar&rsquo;s. Trying to break the icy disdain that now radiated from his almost-friend, Peter found himself becoming just as short of patience as the killer nearly two weeks after the rescue from Ellis Island.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It all came to a head when Sylar brought Monica to tears in the training ring. The critique was actually reasonable, their leader pointing out the flaw Peter himself had discovered in their first fight together. It was the vicious, clever turn of phrase that struck too close to the bone and placed a last straw on Peter&rsquo;s back.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar stood, arms folded, an elegant sneer in place. From his neat black shirt and dress trousers to his impeccable hair, the killer radiated confidence and a pitiless disappointment in everything around him...and everyone.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;like a robot with bad programming. Do you think the FedMarshals haven&rsquo;t run sims on battling you? They had you for ten months Monica, they know you better than you know yourself.

Flicking a gaze at Monica&rsquo;s dejected figure, Peter stoked his anger and forced out all what-might-have-beens.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The icy-dead glare turned its full power on the nurse. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;m leader of the combat team Petrelli, I decide when it&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; The glare became dismissive. &ldquo;You can fuck off.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>That&rsquo;s it asshole.</i> Peter came to a mental resolution. He was fitting in to this time, no longer a lost soul and he wouldn&rsquo;t have his opinion disparaged. Not by anyone&hellip;certainly not by Sylar.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You can leave her out of your bitch-fest Sylar.&rdquo; Peter countered, voice becoming hotter in inversion to the ice in his adversary&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Monica did her job that day. Stop taking your anger out on everyone else.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A brilliant gleam entered the dark gaze as the frozen anger finally began to thaw. &ldquo;Maybe I should take it out on you Petrelli? As I remember you pushed to continue the hospital raid, all the while the boys were being tasered and loaded into vans&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have known,&rdquo; Peter defended. He&rsquo;d worked himself over for that decision enough times that Sylar couldn&rsquo;t find a weakness there. &ldquo;No-one could. The lab was the viable target, Claude was right&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Strong fingers closed into a fist in Peter&rsquo;s shirt. &ldquo;When you see your invisible lover again, tell him he&rsquo;s on my angry-list as well. The intelligence was so badly flawed we should never have trusted him to begin with. Something else you are responsible for I might add.&rdquo; The threat against Claude was useless as Peter hadn&rsquo;t had contact with his mentor in days. But it still served to pull Peter over the brink into fury.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Stop saying he&rsquo;s my lover. Stop blaming other people for the mistake,&rdquo; pinching into the nerves in the killer&rsquo;s wrist, Peter broke the hold on his shirt and pushed Sylar backwards with a hard, human-strength shove.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Catching himself easily, Sylar smiled a cruel mirthless grin. &ldquo;Sorry Petrelli,&rdquo; he said with no trace of regret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just having trouble keeping track of how many members of the house you <i>are </i>sleeping with. What did Raines do to get kicked out of your bed? Or hasn&rsquo;t he left and is still hovering round like a&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter&rsquo;s fist connected with that gorgeous jaw. The sudden shock at his action couldn&rsquo;t cover the satisfaction of shutting up the lewd accusations and the bloom of red on the fine, lightly tanned skin. Instant healing removed all trace of bruising, but that didn&rsquo;t halt two long-fingered hands from catching Peter on the chest and shoving him out the door of the garage. A telekinetic burst causing Peter to land on his back by the tennis court.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ribs clicking back into place, Peter stood quickly as Sylar stalked towards him like his rage-filled angelic namesake.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Stop it guys.

A small puff of frigid breathe issued from his lips as Tracy&rsquo;s power manifested. &ldquo;But I meant, the man you are really pissed off at, the man you know fucked up and are punishing as much as you can is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The bolt of lightening caught Peter in the guts and pushed him once again to the ground.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Enough, both of you!&rdquo; Angela might well not have spoken for all the attention she was paid.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Spare me the empathic psychoanalysis.&rdquo; Sylar laughed without humour as Peter rose. &ldquo;You have no idea what I&rsquo;m feeling.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Most of the time, apart from anger,&rdquo; Peter shot out as darts of ice sliced open the skin on Sylar&rsquo;s high cheekbone and temple. A small private blizzard surrounded the taller man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you <i>feel </i>anything at all.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sudden hurt crossed the other&rsquo;s face that had nothing to do with blood, but Peter was relentless in his rage. &ldquo;Everyone here accepted you even after you were found guilty of all those murders.&rdquo; Peter shot a meaningful glance at the blue-white electricity dancing in Sylar&rsquo;s fingers.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The handsome face paled and the power vanished from sight.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Peter, no.&rdquo; Claire this time and Peter hesitated. Would have stopped if not for the sudden humanity he saw once again in the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so angry at yourself Sylar, but you&rsquo;re taking it out on those that care about you now. Stop it before you do something they won&rsquo;t forgive.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter&rsquo;s plea made an impact like his punch never had, but Gabriel Gray was never the kind of man who could easily accept his feelings. As Sylar his rage was manifest, no-one had ever shown him how to understand guilt.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;They barely forgive me as it is Petrelli, you should know that.&rdquo; Sylar left himself powerless in the face of the ice storm around him, his words a weapon all on their own. &ldquo;They never forgave you for destroying Pinehearst you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Gabriel!&rdquo; Nathan&rsquo;s voice held something like fear, but Peter was transfixed by his adversary&rsquo;s words.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You said you were kidnapped the night the building exploded?&rdquo; Sylar asked as they were having a genteel conversation and not in the middle of a magnificent brawl.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s lips were going numb from the cold.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Funny that your precious, loving family, the ones you say I should watch my tongue around,&rdquo; Sylar stepped out of the dying ice storm and spoke clearly into Peter&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Funny that they didn&rsquo;t even wonder where you were.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter couldn&rsquo;t form a word, a cold that had nothing to do with Tracy taking his limbs in paralysis.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;They thought you&rsquo;d simply run off in your typical adolescent way.

Sylar was dressed in such a casual manner that the nurse knew he was intruding into &lsquo;personal time&rsquo;, but found no other option. The few times he had seen the other man had been during group meetings or at meals. Hardly the time to broach such a complicated subject. Even now it seemed impossible with Sylar barefoot in black jeans and a blue, long-sleeved t-shirt, the antique marble mantle clock from the dinning room spread across the fine linen tablecloth.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Why his mother used such niceties in the back garden was anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sitting across from the neatly ordered rows of parts, Peter watched quietly for several minutes.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Claire told me why you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He kept his voice low and neutral.

The moment he&rsquo;d seen the killer standing on the stairs Peter&rsquo;s defences had gone into overdrive and they hadn&rsquo;t slowed down since. He&rsquo;d been reacting to threats for so very long. Primatech, Adam, Jesse, Pinehearst and finally the Internment Centre had all contributed to Peter&rsquo;s empathy retreating so far inside him that he&rsquo;d missed everyone&rsquo;s emotional responses to Sylar.

A circle of spirals concertinaed out and several large chunks of brick hit the ground. It startled Peter into a shiver.

It took only a few minutes to navigate the semi-familiar layout and find the door he needed. Once inside he snatched the best sizes he could find and raced back out. They might have left already, thinking Peter would have no choice but to follow. In that case Peter would go back in himself. He was invisible, he had the code, and he could find the lab and destroy the serum. Danko would probably be able to escape, but Peter was going to destroy the poison they were making, even if he had to do it alone.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Fortunately he wouldn&rsquo;t have to. Mohinder was arguing fiercely with Sylar who looked like he wanted to cut someone&rsquo;s head open, while Monica nervously clutched her elbows and hid beside Hiro.

Unlike his own rampage alongside Flint in the Primatech lab, the geneticist was methodical about the destruction of someone&rsquo;s hard hours of labour. Methodical, precise and downright <i>scary</i> Peter amended.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It had seemed too easy. The trio involved in a domestic love spat accompanied by a couple of harried orderlies making their way through the overcrowded ER and into the lifts. At least Claude&rsquo;s information had been correct in this instance. The government lab concealed three floors beneath the hospital morgue, the lift door refusing to open until Mohinder ripped it apart with his fingernails.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The codes for all the keypads were perfect. Not a single hitch.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter had been worried that Sylar would be the fanatic on this mission, what with the whole torture by the guy running the operation thing. But Danko wasn&rsquo;t here, the FedMarshal leader having departed for Washington a day early according to a terrified guard. The rage had cooled from the killer&rsquo;s demeanour, allowing Suresh&rsquo;s enthusiasm to dominate the rest of the mission.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The devastation had left the geneticist&rsquo;s eyes, to be relaced by grim satisfaction as Monica, Peter and Hiro subdued the guards and Sylar terrified the techs into submission with barely a raised eyebrow. With the staff locked away in a storage closet by a cheerful Hiro, the lab was now empty and vulnerable to Mohinder&rsquo;s revenge.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Watching the geneticist bring another batch of test tubes to Sylar to have them irradiated, Peter waited until he&rsquo;d moved off before asking sotto voce, &ldquo;Having a little bit too much fun with this isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">As promised Peter had stuck close to his leader, not exactly a hardship except for the ridiculously long legs that he had to race to keep up with, and was now at his current perch not four feet from where the killer was standing looking over some of the documents they&rsquo;d recovered.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;The serum is based on one developed six years ago from a strain of the Shanti Virus.&rdquo; Eyes still on the reports in his hands, Sylar answered just as quietly. &ldquo;The drug that inhibits abilities and allows them to keep us prisoner&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;was invented by Mohinder.&rdquo; Peter finished the sentence, a sudden wave of sympathy washing over him. Looking at his old friend with new eyes, the nurse now understood why the other man had forbidden Sylar from levelling the lab and gone for a more methodical approach.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;None of it survives,&rdquo; Suresh had sworn. &ldquo;No chance of a thumb-stick or print out with even the beginning of the formula.&rdquo; Pointing at the refrigerators, he had nodded Monica forward. &ldquo;Start there, everything exposed to radiation by Gabriel then we&rsquo;ll get onto the computers.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Twenty minutes later and Peter was now not only sympathetic but also impressed.

Whatever he saw Peter couldn&rsquo;t guess, but two long strides had Sylar within inches of him, causing the nurse to straighten his back and raise his chin to the taller man. Long-fingered hands came to rest on the bench by Peter&rsquo;s knees and the alluring; pine almond scent of the killer began to flood his senses.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Handsome mouth only a small chasm away, Sylar smiled with a hint of the predator. &ldquo;That is the nicest thing you&rsquo;ve said to me since you arrived.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">True, but Peter hadn&rsquo;t known that he was supposed to be <i>nice</i> to the other man till two days ago.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Licking his lips at the sudden parched air of the lab he answered, &ldquo;Really? I&rsquo;m sure I can do better than that&hellip;&rdquo; words lingering flirtatiously. Part of Peter&rsquo;s brain was screaming <i>whatthefuckareyoudoing?</i> While another part growled <i>yesgrabhimgrabhimgrabhim.</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sudden heat flared in the midnight eyes and hands caught his calves, unlacing his ankles and drawing Peter&rsquo;s backside closer to the edge of the lab table.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Closer to Sylar.<i> </i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Lean hips now pressed to the length of Peter&rsquo;s spread thighs, only a scant inch of steel bench keeping their groins from touching, Sylar returned his hands to the table palm down beside the seated man. Effectively trapping Peter in that position.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Do better.&rdquo; The velvet voice was infused with raw lust, causing an answering flare to race up Peter&rsquo;s spine.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">His mind spun. &ldquo;You saved my life three times at Primatech. It might be years for you, but it&rsquo;s only months for me. I never said thank you for those.&rdquo; Peter leaned fractionally closer, his lips almost but not quite touching Sylar&rsquo;s. In this position their height difference was almost negated and Peter revelled in looking directly into the now-burning gaze.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;The prisoners are resigned to their fate&hellip;oh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter snapped his head backwards at Hiro&rsquo;s words, feeling his cheeks began to burn. The Japanese man stared at them with a dumbfounded expression. Sylar, with his fucking cool as ice face, didn&rsquo;t even look surprised at the interruption.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;The others are in the last room on the right, when they&rsquo;re done take them home.

Peter was forced to catch himself on his elbows with the other man nearly climbing over him. It was damn sexy. This unfairly gorgeous no-longer arch enemy, all broad shoulders and wicked expressions that curled Peter&rsquo;s toes and made his cock hard.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Hard just like the one pressed against his thigh.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Fucking hell, they hadn&rsquo;t even kissed and Peter was more turned on than he&rsquo;d been in years. Particularly with Sylar avoiding his lips, choosing to breathe in a long slow intake of air beneath Peter&rsquo;s ear.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You were saying?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Completely unable to stop the low moan that the contact summoned, Peter gave up any flimsy pretence of passivity and leaned his face over to nuzzle at the jaw so close to him. Like some feline offering affection up to the dominant animal, Peter indulged his addiction to skin contact by dragging his lips, cheekbone and forehead across Sylar&rsquo;s light stubble.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">God, Peter wanted to lick him, he smelled so good.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Long fingers curled at the back of Peter&rsquo;s neck for a single, perfect moment. Then snarling a handful of hair Sylar pulled his head back so that they could once again lock eyes. Startled from his ardour, Peter saw the brilliant gaze now almost wild with need, the low panting breaths from Sylar forcing him to rock hardness and bringing forth another suppressed moan.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo; The benediction was drenched with the unholy sin of lust. &ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ready to move on to making that sin a reality, Peter&rsquo;s skull thumped painfully back on the lab bench as the fingers supporting it disappeared and the body he was clinging to reared back to the floor.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter stared at the fluorescent lights overhead wondering if maybe that had just been an awesome wet dream he&rsquo;d just been woken from. Still sprawled on his back, legs parted wantonly, Peter turned his head to see Sylar thirty feet across the room looking like he was one mad impulse away from doing Peter serious harm.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Or seriously doing something else to him, Peter wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure which.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the velvet voice was cold despite the expression in the chameleon eyes. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Head cocked to one side like a bird, Sylar kept his eyes on Peter as the nurse sat up and adjusted his clothing.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Amongst other things.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;The others are done, take us home.&rdquo; The mission leader was back, wiping away the lust-shrouded predator like he&rsquo;d never been.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter walked over and carefully took Sylar&rsquo;s coat-sleeve in his hand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Yes, Boss.&rdquo; It was playful, sarcastic and if Peter read the look in the killer&rsquo;s eyes correctly, the most dangerous thing he&rsquo;d done all day.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar didn&rsquo;t get a chance to retaliate as the next thing they saw was the study at the mansion and Angela Petrelli&rsquo;s formidable glare.</p></lj-cut>"

Three long days of recuperation and frustration as he failed to corner Sylar anywhere in the halls of the Petrelli mansion. In fact, had Peter not been regularly speaking with Claude about everything he&rsquo;d missed in the last five years, he might have suspected the killer of murdering his mentor for his ability. &nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He&rsquo;d been nervous and jumpy that first twenty-four hours in the mansion. Convinced the FedMarshal&rsquo;s had followed him to New York, were ready to storm the mansion any second and arrest his people. He&rsquo;d woken from a nightmare of Claire and baby Noah in the compound that first night, sweaty and trembling at the possibility.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It had been Noah, the elder one, who&rsquo;d realised Peter&rsquo;s fear and explained that there really wasn&rsquo;t any need. In the basement, now Mohinder&rsquo;s research lab, laid an elderly woman with serene sleeping features.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Nancy was with the Company for ten years. She is the only known occurrence of her talent we have ever seen.&rdquo; Bennet explained with a fond expression.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; Peter asked, eyes professionally scanning Nancy&rsquo;s monitors and the devices that kept her alive.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Nancy can make people forget something existed by simply willing it to be so. She was a jewel thief when my predecessors discovered her and made her an agent. The entire building lasts no longer than two seconds in anyone&rsquo;s memory. Nancy even learned to erase paper and electronic medium as well.&rdquo; The former Company seemed quite proud of Nancy&rsquo;s skill.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Relief tinged with concern, Peter wondered, &ldquo;Why is she in a coma?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;A battle with the Spider years ago left her like this. We suspect he has telepathy similar to Parkman and reduced Nancy to this while she was protecting the house. We can still come and go as we please, none of the residents are affected by her power. Even asleep she still keeps us safe.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">*****</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter was more confident than ever that he needed to be on the mission to find this &lsquo;Danko&rsquo; and the Spider who controlled him. Freeing Nancy was just one of the many reasons to end the tyranny they all lived under.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Still searching for a moment to try and talk Sylar into letting him join, Peter entered his father&rsquo;s three car garage and watched a young woman beat the crap out of a punching bag.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">No expensive vehicles now adorned this space; instead a fully-equipped gym and state of the art security and computer system. Beside a raised platform that served as a boxing ring a bank of massive flat-screen monitors played various movie fight scenes one after the other. From Bruce Lee to John Wayne with a touch of Tarantino, the endless images of physical violence were rather unsettling.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Even more so to Peter was the woman watching the monitors with rapt attention. Toeing off his shoes, Peter dropped a towel and bottle of water on a nearby chair and cautiously approached the ring. A scene of Bruce Lee leaping and kicking finished as the woman stretched carefully then turned and attacked the punching bag.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It took him a couple of minutes to realise she was duplicating the fight she had just watched. Exactly. Not just copying the moves, but perfectly replicating every form and turn like she had been the actor in question.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Watching the impressive display, Peter began to notice the fatal flaw in her otherwise powerful ability. If she allowed him to use it, he would have to work on&hellip;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Hey there.&rdquo; If her ability was wonderful, her smile was just gorgeous. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Monica, you&rsquo;re the new guy huh?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Returning the smile, Peter approached the ring. &ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Yeah, the famous baby brother who can get chemistry going with any other &lsquo;special&rsquo; on the planet.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter&rsquo;s jaw dropped in astonishment. &ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">But the sweet expression on Monica&rsquo;s face had already darkened with embarrassment before the word was completed.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I mean your power! Your power.&rdquo; She blushed even harder if possible. &ldquo;Mohinder says you have a chemical reaction to other people with powers and can copy their abilities, so it&rsquo;s chemistry, but not&hellip;you know&hellip;<i>chemistry</i>&hellip;although you <i>are</i> really&hellip;umm&hellip;&rdquo; Her words trailed away into nothing.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter regathered his thoughts and decided once again that he had no idea what went on in women&rsquo;s mind&rsquo;s most of time. Dragging the conversation to something he could understand, Peter gestured to the ring.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really good. Care to show me a few moves?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The woman paled a little, but caught her composure and bounced back from the single rope surrounding the canvas square. &ldquo;Sure, c&rsquo;mon in.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Warming up quickly, Peter stripped down to his sweat pants and t-shirt and relaxed his body. He was barefoot, as he had been on the first day his life had been ripped askew once again.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 0cm"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be dead in a week if you don&rsquo;t learn something quick. I&rsquo;ll show you, but it&rsquo;s not on me if you mess up and die anyway.&rdquo;</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">They engaged cautiously at first, working out boundaries, getting comfortable being in each other&rsquo;s personal space. Minutes went by as Peter slowly delved into the training he&rsquo;d been given and showed its edge in this non-deadly environment. Back and forth, punch and kick. Few blows landed, mostly just sparring. When Monica was put to the mats, Peter helped her up. When Peter lost balance, she ducked back to give him a moment.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Body warming to the exercise Peter began to enjoy himself in a way he could never have last time he used these skills.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to kill you straight up, just get you on your knees or on your face in the ground, so use that. Be prepared to kill them and they&rsquo;ll stop trying to catch you out.&rdquo;</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It happened rather quickly. The fight escalated from friendly sparring to an actual test of skills and then to something else. Maybe it was Monica realising his head wasn&rsquo;t all there, maybe Peter regressed back to the compound, but suddenly the punches weren&rsquo;t being pulled.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&ldquo;Everything else I teach you means nothing if you don&rsquo;t keep moving. Best way to win a fight is to not be there.&rdquo;</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ducking a high kick, Peter dropped to scoop her legs out from under and caught a hard foot on the shoulder. He nearly broke her ankle, but Monica flipped backwards just in time and spun back for his exposed head. He ducked again and caught her wrist a glancing blow, then her sternum a not-so glancing one. Breathe &lsquo;oofed&rsquo; from her lungs, but didn&rsquo;t stop a punch that missed his jaw by less than an inch.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt""><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fast enough to keep away from those kinds of swings, it&rsquo;s the ones who&rsquo;re just as fast and stronger that&rsquo;ll be the problem.&rdquo;</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The battle was now in earnest, back and forth with no quarter asked or given. This woman had the moves of a hundred fights programmed into her body, every move perfectly replicated down to the last detail. If this went on much longer Monica would probably snap Peter&rsquo;s neck, her repertoire was just that massive. She&rsquo;d eventually find a style that would win.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He had to use the flaw he&rsquo;d seen when he&rsquo;s first observed her. Peter was a good fighter, he&rsquo;d had to be. But this was a &lsquo;power&rsquo; Monica was using, it was next to impossible to defeat.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">So&hellip;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter dropped out of the sequence they were exchanging and slipped to her left; she turned then shot out a kick to counter the feint. He wasn&rsquo;t there. Every time Monica tried to complete a move, Peter did something unexpected, like dropping to the floor or turning a martial art punch into a boxing uppercut. It was almost cheating, but Peter knew if it worked it meant her power had a limit. She&rsquo;d need to know that if she was on the mission. Peter wouldn&rsquo;t kill her. FedMarshal&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t so kind.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">His shoulders hit the canvas mat after a particularly nasty strike, so Peter tumbled back and tried a semi-circle kick. As expected, Monica ducked. She didn&rsquo;t really have a choice; her body was running this battle, not her mind.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Monica ducked right into Peter&rsquo;s elbow.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He pulled the blow at the last second, if he hadn&rsquo;t it would have shattered her cheekbone. Instead she&rsquo;d have a spectacular bruise and Peter a guilty knot to add to the ones already twisting his soul up.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; He dropped to his knees beside her prone form and gently checked her head and neck for any other injuries. God, he&rsquo;d hit her so <i>hard.</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Its fine,&rdquo; Monica panted, hand to her face, looking up at the lights above them. &ldquo;That was <i>awesome.</i>&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A laugh bubbled up from Peter&rsquo;s throat. She wasn&rsquo;t angry, she was <i>happy.</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I have never&hellip;<i>never</i>&hellip;had it so good.&rdquo; Monica looked into his eyes and winked at her own innuendo. Intended this time.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Continuing to chuckle, Peter&rsquo;s head startled up as the dark youth he knew as Micah, the techno-sweet-talker who had rigged up the entire system, reached Monica&rsquo;s other side.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Are you okay? Can you feel your feet?&rdquo; The sudden angry glare he received stole Peter&rsquo;s laugh away.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; Monica slapped her cousin&rsquo;s leg lightly. &ldquo;Peter just showed me my ass for the first time in years. You should thank him for taking my ego down a notch or two.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Years?&rdquo; Peter asked quietly.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; a dense velvet voice confirmed. Peter looked over to see Sylar, Claire and a half-dozen other of the sanctuary&rsquo;s younger residents standing just outside the ring. Most of the teenagers were talking and noisily laughing, pretending to mock punch one another in imitation of Peter and Monica.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s undefeated champion,&rdquo; Sylar continued. &ldquo;Till now.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter stood and offered a hand to Monica who accepted, groaning.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;A power?&rdquo; Sylar asked, his eyes knowing the answer.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Perversely pleased at the shock on his antagonists face, Peter smiled with what he was sure were bloodied lips. &ldquo;Prison.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Eyes locked with bitter chocolate ones, Peter didn&rsquo;t notice the young man offering him his towel and water, till he felt a nudge at his side. Breaking that heated gaze, Peter thanked the no-longer sour faced Luke for the courtesy and received an excited smile in return.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;No one can believe you took Monica down. That rocked <i>so</i> hard. I though she was going to kill you man, and then wham! She&rsquo;s eating the mats.&rdquo; About to call the boy on his enthusiasm for seeing an ally defeated, Peter didn&rsquo;t get the chance.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Shut the fuck up Luke.&rdquo; The woman warrior shot in a friendly tone, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t have the guts to get in here with me because you know I&rsquo;d splatter you all over the place.&rdquo; Peter didn&rsquo;t miss the almost divine desire for this to occur displayed on Micah&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Peter did and he won, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean balls make you better. Asshole.&rdquo; She finished with a sweet giggle just to top off the obscenity.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Yeah, well Ethan says Peter was like a ninja-god in that compound, every one of the prisoners was scared shitless of him so that means balls are better than tits any&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter interrupted the bizarrely crude and sexist argument with the truth. &ldquo;I was taught by a woman Luke.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Betrayed, the youth stared in shock. &ldquo;Dude, no.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; Monica gloated, before leaving the ring to commiseration from the assembled onlookers.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter looked up to find Sylar still watching him, Claire nowhere to be seen. Dark eyes rested on the youth almost vibrating with excitement beside Peter and once again became filled with anger.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He hadn&rsquo;t even touched the kid and Sylar wanted to tear Peter&rsquo;s fingers off.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Pissed off and running on adrenalin, Peter jumped down to the floor. He put as much of the predator as he could into his walk towards the other man.

Noah was clambering back and forth into and out of his mother&rsquo;s lap. Peter smiled at the lovely scene and thought of all the paintings and statues he&rsquo;d seen of the Madonna, with child. Claire was hardly the divine mother, instead she was earthy and gorgeous and real.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Tell me about Sylar.&rdquo; It sounded like a command, but Peter knew Claire would understand his tone. Her green eyes looked at him without surprise.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;<i>Gabriel,</i>&rdquo; the correction was clear but not judgemental. &ldquo;Gabriel was nearly dead when Nathan and Hiro found him. Danko had been trying to persuade him to join the FedMarshal&rsquo;s &lsquo;special&rsquo; unit. Gabriel declined and was repeatedly punished for it. Danko would almost kill him in some horrific way and then force the serum anti-viral through his system until my power returned and he healed.&rdquo; Despite how Sylar had acquired it, Claire&rsquo;s lips were tight with loathing and sorrow at her own ability being abused in such a way.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;When we got him here with Monica and Luke, Gabriel healed again and then&hellip;&rdquo; A pause while she visibly collected her thoughts. &ldquo;&hellip;he handed himself over to us for judgement.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Judgement?&rdquo; Peter repeated, mind racing.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;He asked that twelve of his peers, those with abilities, stand in judgement on his crimes and decide his fate. He admitted every one of his murders.&rdquo; Another pause, this one caused Claire&rsquo;s voice to become tinged with anger. &ldquo;Thirty-two people.&rdquo; God, Peter couldn&rsquo;t even comprehend and he&rsquo;d suffered the hunger that Sylar&rsquo;s ability fuelled. Thirty-two?</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Thirty-three if you include me, thirty-four if we include you.&rdquo; Her hand reached over to lace fingers with his. &ldquo;Sylar was found guilty on all counts.&rdquo; This time the emphasis on the name was deliberate. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t decide on his punishment. Mohinder, Dad and I voted immediate death, yeah,&rdquo; Claire corrected at Peter&rsquo;s surprised look. &ldquo;Sylar asked for Dad to be on the jury even without a power. The plan was to stake his head and then burn him on a pyre where no-one would ever look again.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A gruesome sentence that Peter could completely understand, he&rsquo;d have voted with them had he been on the jury.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;It was Angela who offered an alternative. She argued that we had all committed crimes because of our abilities and that Sylar was the least responsible as his power is what urged him to murder.

We objected but&hellip;it was the only humane thing to do. We didn&rsquo;t really have the right to put him down like a mad dog, particularly as Matt had suggested a cure of sorts. The problem was Sylar&hellip;well Gabriel after the block went in and the killer was tamed. Gabriel didn&rsquo;t want to live; he&rsquo;d hoped we&rsquo;d find him guilty and kill him. The block also added to his&hellip;pain.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The sorrow and care in Claire&rsquo;s tone surprised him, although really, baby Noah was evidence that the affection between Peter&rsquo;s niece and her arch-enemy had changed dramatically.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;His personality hadn&rsquo;t changed, you&rsquo;ve seen that.&rdquo; Claire&rsquo;s lips twitched. &ldquo;But without the hunger Gabriel&rsquo;s urge to kill was gone and he&rsquo;s actually a pretty amazing human being. When you get to know him. That human being didn&rsquo;t want to keep living after what he&rsquo;d done. He begged me&hellip;&rdquo; Tears stood suddenly in Claire&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;He begged me to kill him, but I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;not now he was a person. Do you know he used to fix watches? No-one did. So&hellip;so I made myself the keeper of his tally. Sort of a parole officer. For every life Gabriel saves, I forgive him a death that he caused.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A small proud smile rose onto her lovely face. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s closed the tally ten times over in the last three years, but it&rsquo;ll never be enough I know. He can barely bring himself to speak to Molly; her presence insures Gabriel will be punished for his crimes until the day he dies. I&rsquo;ll see to it myself, I promised him I would.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">For several minutes Peter processed everything he had just heard while they watched the children get more and more amped up on adrenaline.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I think my mother may have been the more harsh a judge,&rdquo; he offered thoughtfully. &ldquo;It would have been much kinder to just put him out of his misery.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right there. Angela wasn&rsquo;t being <i>kind </i>that day, not at all.&rdquo; Claire agreed, wise beyond her years.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;When did you two fall in love?&rdquo; Peter asked as casually as someone who was desperately trying to be casual.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Claire seemed to choke on her tongue. &ldquo;What?!

Why would you think&hellip;.?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter couldn&rsquo;t help the incredulous look he threw at the child in her lap.

I guess there is a resemblance&hellip;a little,&rdquo; Claire, composure reacquired, looked thoughtfully down at her baby. &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s name is Alex. I helped him escape the FedMarshal&rsquo;s during the war and he found me again after a year or so in hiding.&rdquo; Her smile became decidedly naughty. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Canada right now helping with the underground we&rsquo;ve set up and he&rsquo;ll kick your ass for suggesting I did it with Gabriel.

If Sylar wasn&rsquo;t the baby&rsquo;s father and wasn&rsquo;t with Claire then&hellip;&nbsp;&ldquo;Noah just looks like you both.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Wait till you meet Alex,&rdquo; Claire smiled. &ldquo;He is very tall, dark hair with dark eyes and eyebrows. So yes, I can see where you might think Noah was Gabriel&rsquo;s, but no. His attention has just about always been fixed elsewhere, it&rsquo;s kinda cute actually.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Peter asked distractedly. His whole world view was completely upside down after this conversation. Sylar wasn&rsquo;t really Sylar anymore? How weird and shattering that thought was.

Claire was twenty-one with a full, lush figure that pulled a red-faced stare from Ethan and a sharp glare from her hovering father Noah. Matt Parkman looked to have aged a decade rather than half that, while Mohinder was barely different. Only his eyes showed the reality of the world they live in.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">They were the same people he left behind, yet the differences were stark and painful. Very few have improved over the past five years, only Claire and maybe Hiro seem to be more than they were in Peter&rsquo;s time.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ushered into the comfortable lounge that his father once used as an office, Peter was quickly pressed into a chair and on the receiving end of so many demanding looks that he closed his eyes against them.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ethan had been ready to run from the confronting mass of people in the Petrelli mansion, but fortunately Sandra Bennet had stepped in. Taking one look at the emotional wreck of a sixteen year old boy, she had unleashed her substantial mothering instincts and taken the youth directly to the kitchen. A clear yell had stirred her own son Lyle and another sullen faced young man Peter didn&rsquo;t know to go with her.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Relief at having Ethan&rsquo;s trauma momentarily removed from his mind, Peter accepted the hot coffee Sandra sent in via the youth named Luke and sat back to organise his thoughts.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">In the past three months he had never let himself hope that any of his loved-ones had survived the government purges. Every inmate in the compound had a story of a &lsquo;special&rsquo; dying spectacularly in a hail of FedMarshal gunfire and Peter knew that his people would have been fighting in that war. Over four years since the last battles took place, rarely had new &lsquo;specials&rsquo; appeared. Peter being the most recent before Ethan had been discovered.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">And now this. An enclave of people with abilities run from his childhood home and led, apparently, by his mother and Noah Bennet.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Nathan&rsquo;s voice. Peter heard the strain his brother was experiencing keeping his impatience in check.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Opening his eyes, the nurse found his gaze not on Nathan, but on Sylar. The killer rested easily in a large leather chair on the far side of the room, booted feet on a small end table. His midnight eyes fixed on Peter&rsquo;s face. Sending him an angry disbelieving glare, Peter turned to Angela and took a deep breath.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Last thing I remember from 2007 was the explosion at Pinehearst. I destroyed the formula and got Nathan to safety when Flint set the fire. He flew away, then&hellip;&rdquo; Peter frowned and tried once again to catch the elusive memory. &ldquo;&hellip;I heard something&hellip;someone&hellip;but I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Shaking his head to clear the fog, Peter jumped ahead. &ldquo;I was suddenly somewhere in Arizona, at an old town I think,&rdquo; Peter saw shock enter his mother&rsquo;s eyes and wondered at it.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You travelled in time?&rdquo; Hiro asked keenly.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Yeah, must have. But it didn&rsquo;t feel the same as when you and I did it, more painful for one.&rdquo; He grimaced. &ldquo;I started to fly east, but some helicopters decided to chase me and I got shot down.&rdquo; Looking over at Nathan, Peter shook his head, &ldquo;Not something I would recommend. I was tranquilised and transported to the Northern Internment Station where they kept me for three months till Ethan arrived and we escaped. Then I came here.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Looking at the assembled faces, Peter could see something hidden amongst them. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Angela took his hand and placed it on her knee, patting it compulsively as she spoke. &ldquo;You vanished five years ago. Nathan looked everywhere but you were just gone. When the President announced our existence and the restrictions that we&rsquo;d be placed under, some fought back and the wars began. We thought&hellip;&rdquo; His mother&rsquo;s eyes became suspiciously wet.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;We concluded you&rsquo;d died in the wars Pete.&rdquo; Nathan said grimly.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter nodded his understanding, but was distracted from answering by the derisive snort from the leather arm-chair. Sylar was looking at the ceiling now, but his jaw and throat exuded contempt at them all.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be here Gabriel.&rdquo; Nathan said with a hard familiarity.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">An elegant wave of the hand. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t miss it Nathan.&rdquo; An emphasis on his brother&rsquo;s name that had little to do with manners and more with scorn.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Knowing that the multitude of questions he wanted answered would have to wait until they could talk at length, Peter looked to Hiro.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s stopping you from going back and fixing all this Hiro? You&rsquo;ve done it before.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The small Japanese man stood quickly and made a neat, formal bow. &ldquo;Peter Petrelli, I have made a vow never to tamper with the past. Nothing good can come of it.&rdquo; Ando, sitting in the next chair rolled his eyes at the statement.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Also, he can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sylar drawled.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter kept his eyes on Hiro. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Deflating his proud stance, Hiro sighed. &ldquo;Despite my vow I tried to go back. To stop the President of America from telling the world about us. But my power does not work, something is stopping it. I cannot travel back in time.&rdquo; Sitting down again he looked so dejected that Peter leaned forward in sympathy.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault Hiro. Your power is very difficult to use&hellip;I remember.&rdquo; Smiling to show he understood, Peter was pleased to see the other man brighten a little and accept the small comfort.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;ll be useful to have everyone feel better about themselves. I can&rsquo;t believe we went so long without <i>that</i> talent in our arsenal.&rdquo; The sarcasm dripped viciously from every word Sylar spoke.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter slowly stood up. He&rsquo;d dealt with any number of aggressive, murderous felons in the compound. Sylar couldn&rsquo;t generate fear in him anymore, no matter the gleam in his dark eyes. Remaining seated the killer raised his eyes to Peter&rsquo;s face and grinned.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Gabriel, go away,&rdquo; Claire ordered from the doorway.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar didn&rsquo;t move. &ldquo;Oh no Darlin.&rdquo; Faked Texas honey infused the velvet voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all astir to see what the brat prince can do these days. Ain&rsquo;t you curious too?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only been home for an hour Gabriel. Give Peter a chance...&rdquo; Claire didn&rsquo;t bat an eyelid at the mockery.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Its fine Claire,&rdquo; Peter interrupted gently. &ldquo;At first I thought I could only fly because Nathan was the last person I was near. But then I touched one of the other prisoners and copied her ability to decompose paper. I thought I&rsquo;d lost the flight for a while till old techniques came back to me and I used it again.&rdquo; Peter resolutely did not think about seventeen feet of chain. He walked right up to Sylar&rsquo;s chair and leaned forward. &ldquo;So your answer <i>Sylar,</i> is I can do anything you can do&hellip;&rdquo; dropping his hand to the killer&rsquo;s, Peter felt the warm rush of his ability manifesting before the brief contact was harshly ended by the other man. &ldquo;&hellip;better.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Looking into furious dark eyes, Peter called his coffee cup to hand with telekinesis and took a sip.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Sylar rose sharply and loomed over him with a thunderous expression on his face. Peter, his confidence faded somewhat, backed away as he remembered the nature of the man he had just baited.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Then given how very <i>gifted</i> you are Petrelli, why don&rsquo;t you take Nakamura&rsquo;s power and go back to save us all from this terrible place.&rdquo; The challenge was unmistakable.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Claire stepped between them with Nathan just behind her. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">But Peter couldn&rsquo;t give in now. He had no excuse, no reason to linger when he could do what Sylar suggested and make things right at long last. Avoiding Claire&rsquo;s desperate grip he moved to Hiro and touched his hand. Feeling another ability curl into his being, Peter concentrated on the smell and sounds of the woods at night.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The power rose like wave and came crashing down like a battering ram.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Agony split Peter&rsquo;s brain and stopped his heart, something wet on his lip and chaos all around.

A raised eyebrow was all he received in response as his mentor and not-quite friend pointed at a glass of water on the nightstand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just learned the hard way why time travel is impossible, it&rsquo;s being blocked but no-one knows why.&rdquo; Claude&rsquo;s lecturer tone hadn&rsquo;t changed, even if his facial hair had. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;and the Justice League is downstairs having lunch and a conversation about their prodigal son.&rdquo; Standing from his position lounging on the side of Peter&rsquo;s bed, Claude tugged his coat into place (a different one, it had to be, because no-one could have kept the remains of that other tattered garment together for five years) and disappeared.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter looked longingly at the glass and had almost mustered the energy to move when he felt gentle fingers riffle through his hair.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Glad you showed your face at last, Pup.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The door opened and closed.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Groaning, Peter rolled to a sitting position and inhaled the water. The throbbing in his head marginally reduced, he staggered to the bathroom and under the hottest water his skin could tolerate. In the compound they&rsquo;d been allowed access to a shower three times a week. Due to his chain, Peter had been given sole admittance with a phalanx of guards after all the other inmates had bathed.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He hadn&rsquo;t had a shower hotter than lukewarm in ninety-two, no...ninety-seven days. God what a luxury he once took for granted.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Scrubbing what felt like an epidermis of dust and sweat from his skin, Peter took in his surroundings and realised that nothing had changed. Nothing. In five years of war and oppression, his bedroom in the family mansion was exactly as he&rsquo;d last seen it. Wondering at his mother&rsquo;s mental state that she would keep everything so exact, Peter searched his wardrobe for clothing. Simple dark pants and a grey cotton Henley - that felt a little tight but at least fit - had Peter feeling about a million times more human.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The only thing left to find was food.

The ravaged countryside, devastated communities and broken lives. But if the lunch on the patio was any indication, Peter wouldn&rsquo;t have believed his own eyes. After being greeted by his mother who almost wanted to envelope him in her tiny frame and his brother looking like he wanted to order Peter back to his room, he&rsquo;d finally snagged a seat and a plate of food. While the ingredients were basic, the cooking was excellent and Peter made note to seek Sandra out and thank her for her mad cooking skills.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Finishing his meal, Peter sipped from a glass of ice tea while he watched the people scattered around the patio and wondered how they had all come to be here. He had so many questions.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Why were Matt&rsquo;s eyes permanently like Isaac&rsquo;s had been and was he as completely blind as he seemed? Who was the young woman sitting so attentively at his right hand and what did the presence of the blonde speed-woman mean?</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Mohinder looked like his soul had been torn out even as his devastated gaze watched over several small children cavorting around the back garden. A beautiful dark-haired youth spoke gently with a woman who had to be Tracy Strauss but lacked her hard-edged expressions and sad mouth.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It was when Peter&rsquo;s gaze came to rest on the lounge near the wall that his heart leapt into his throat. Claire had just sat down with a baby in her arms. Guessing the age at about sixth months from the way the boy was snarling her long hair in his chubby fist, Peter saw the instant resemblance to his parents. Sandy blond hair and green eyes under striking brows and a jaw that would be compelling when the softness gave way.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He&rsquo;d seen this child before. In another future that smelled of fresh orange juice and contained the words &lsquo;Uncle Peter&rsquo; and &lsquo;my son Noah&rsquo;.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Claire and Sylar?</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Swallowing hard around the obstruction in his throat, Peter made the necessary mental leaps and came to the conclusion that he really, really didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. He rested his aching forehead on the cool chill of the glass and took a deep breath.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Wrenching his mind from the wrongness of that situation, Peter asked quietly, &ldquo;Who is the Spider?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Conversation stuttered to a halt.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Nathan, the natural speaker, answered. &ldquo;When the President declared a state of emergency and issued warrants of arrest for everyone with the &lsquo;special&rsquo; genetic code, he placed a military assassin called Danko in charge of the Federal Marshals. He&rsquo;s responsible for nearly fifty deaths during those first weeks.&rdquo; A roughness coloured Nathan&rsquo;s voice, but Peter couldn&rsquo;t decipher its cause.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Noah Bennet stepped in, his hand stroking gently over his namesake&rsquo;s forehead as the baby was freed to crawl across the rug. &ldquo;Danko made a deal with one of the &lsquo;specials&rsquo; and used that individual&rsquo;s abilities to hunt down and recruit or murder anyone else on their list. Now that almost everyone is dead or in hiding, he and Danko run things in what&rsquo;s left of Washington.&rdquo; Bennet took off his glasses and began to polish them on a handkerchief. &ldquo;The President rules the Americas in name only. The Spider is the true power now. We believe even Danko is his pawn and not the other way around.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter gave that some thought. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been able to stop him.&rdquo; With that truth obvious he looked directly at Sylar for the first time since realising Noah&rsquo;s parentage. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t killed him.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried,&rdquo; Nathan gritted out. &ldquo;Every damn week Gabriel leads a team out to put an end to him or one of his followers&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s never there when we arrive.&rdquo; Sylar finished, anger scouring the deep voice in red fury.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A small hand to the killer&rsquo;s arm and the rage subsided slightly, although it glittered in the brilliant eyes as they glared at Peter.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Gabriel, Luke and Monica were imprisoned by the Spider for months before we could rescue anyone. All of them have tried to kill him, but we can&rsquo;t ever get there in time. He must have a pre-cog in his group of toadies.&rdquo; Claire&rsquo;s eyes softened at they looked at her husband?

A flicked glance from beneath the horn-rimmed glasses, then the blue gaze was back on target. &ldquo;Claude stayed knowing I could see him. He isn&rsquo;t hiding from you any more.&rdquo; Calm and gentle voiced, Peter coaxed the dangerously lethal man to lower his gun.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The invisible asshat snorted in contempt. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t hidin&rsquo; in the first place Pup, just loitering to get the skinny on where the next mission is.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A strong arm suddenly encircled Peter&rsquo;s waist as he was lifted bodily around and down next to Claire.

Angela Petrelli walked slowly round the table to confront the intruder. &ldquo;Matthew told me you visited on occasion. I allowed it because he says you were actually helping us.

Straightening his coat, the tall man looked down at the indomitable woman before him for several long seconds. A glance at the still seated Parkman was decidedly pissed off.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Daddy Long-Legs in Washington has sent Danko here to try and flush you out.

Looking up into burning dark eyes, Peter blamed the rush of blood through his system on fear of an impending fight.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A sudden wicked grin crossed the handsome features so close to his.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">For a moment Peter was dazzled as if the sun had come out from behind a cloud and belted him in the eyes, but he was saved from further action by his mentor&rsquo;s English-accented vowels.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;The drug!&rdquo; Claude called, now sounding a fraction worried.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Angela stopped walking away.

With trained care the cloth was applied to the rough grazes and scratches that encircled Peter&rsquo;s ankle. He&rsquo;d shifted the thick chain loop along his calf to reveal the wounds and was now completing his daily ritual of cleaning and treatment. It could almost be a fruitless gesture. He had managed to get the cuts to scab over half a dozen times in the last few weeks, but without fail something would cause Peter to move in just the wrong way to re-open the injuries.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Two days ago it had been another fight.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Difficult to defend yourself without moving your feet.

As anonymous as possible in black cotton sleep pants and long-sleeved t-shirts, the prisoners had attempted individuality through hair and body art. Peter hadn&rsquo;t needed to do anything to stand out; the fact that he was chained to the fucking ground kept him well-known. And easy to identify.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">No-one was close enough to worry about, so Peter checked his other bruises to make sure everything was getting better and not worse. He&rsquo;d tended a man dying from wounds gone sceptic not six days after he&rsquo;d been brought here. It hadn&rsquo;t really made much difference, probably only prolonged the poor bastard&rsquo;s life by a few days. But Peter had held his hand and been witness to the death. That much he could still do chained and impoverished.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Pretty Pretty!

He didn&rsquo;t need to see the other prisoner, likely jacking off seventeen feet from where Peter sat. Other voices joined in, yelling crude suggestions or calls to &lsquo;shut the fuck up and put it away&rsquo;.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Choosing three pieces of gravel from the small pile near his bare toes, Peter weighed them thoughtfully in his hand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Pretty Pretty!

Come here Pretty&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Shoulder muscled into fluid obedience by necessity; Peter pulled his arm back with startling speed and aimed at just below waist height. Dead on.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Arghh&hellip;fuckin&rsquo; sonofabitch!! Shit me, shit me!&rdquo; The words issued in a hoarse voice from the ball of misery now lying on the ground. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get yours Fucker. You&rsquo;ll get yours.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter looked around the compound to see if anyone was going to try anything. No. They knew better. Shaking his head wearily he also saw that no-one was moving to help the distressed man. Even had he been inclined Peter couldn&rsquo;t do anything. The man had been careful not to come closer than seventeen feet.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The length of Peter&rsquo;s chain.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">*****</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The grinding of gears woke Peter from a cautious slumber. Sunlight crawled gently across the compound as the great roof retracted. Once a sports stadium, the building now housed the most dangerous threats to humanity. A single, massive prison cell and exercise yard rolled into one. Turning to lie on his back, Peter squinted into a cool fall sky and wished for the ninety-eighth time that he could fly away from this hell.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A small movement to his left. Reflexes honed by weeks of living under direct threat had Peter rolling quickly to his feet, an edged piece of rock he&rsquo;d painstakingly unearthed in hand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It was just a kid. Maybe thirteen or so, crouched near the iron stake pinning Peter&rsquo;s chain, arms wrapped around his knees and a face showing nothing but desperation. How the hell he&rsquo;d managed to get inside Peter&rsquo;s perimeter without him waking was terrifying, but for the moment the youth looked harmless. Pivoting, Peter scanned the compound for any of his usual antagonists, but they were all still asleep or grumbling at the sudden glare of sunlight.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Weapon at the ready, Peter stalked towards the boy with a clink of metal and revised his estimate. More like sixteen, the faintest of fair stubble on unmarked cheeks, large feet and hands, long limbs that had yet to be grown into. He&rsquo;d be a tall, well-built man by the time he reached twenty&hellip;if he lived that long.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re new.&rdquo; Surprised at the scratchy sound his voice had become in three months, Peter swallowed and tried again. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The youth tried to shrink further down into his shoulders. &ldquo;Ethan&hellip;I&hellip;they&hellip;they killed my mom and dad. It&rsquo;s all my fault they&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Oh Jesus.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter could just imagine the heart-breaking story. The son demonstrates some fantastic ability; the parents try to conceal him from the government, maybe plan to escape to Europe. They get caught. The parents die protecting their son; the kid is sent to the internment station with dozens of other super-powered humans. Many of the prisoners, locked together in this bastardised arena, were slowly spiralling into inhumanity and madness.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Except Peter. Holding onto his sanity the main focus of existence in recent times.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Dropping down to the patchy grass beside the boy, Peter hid his shiv under some debris and wondered what he was supposed to say to a young man whose life had been destroyed all because he could understand his dog or something.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Ethan. I really am.&rdquo; His voice not so raw now, it was getting a small work-out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong though. None of this is because of you. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think anyone deserves to be here.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ethan&rsquo;s eyes lost some of his horror and took on a whirl of surprise.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;But everyone knows they&rsquo;re all terrorists! It&rsquo;s on the broadcasts all the time, how the specials destroyed the cities and killed the President. How they&rsquo;re kept locked away to keep us all safe.&rdquo; Soft blue eyes looked around the arena at the clusters of black-clad forms. &ldquo;...how <i>we&rsquo;re</i> locked away.&rdquo; He corrected.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;When did you come in? Last night?&rdquo; Peter asked gently.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ethan nodded into his knees. &ldquo;I could barely see, but I didn&rsquo;t want to go anywhere near them.&rdquo; His chin pushed in the direction of the other prisoners.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter let the silence ask his question.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">A shrug. &ldquo;They were all sleeping away from you, so I figured you were either a mass murderer they were scared of and I could run away fast enough. Or you were the only safe place in the area.&rdquo; Another adolescent shrug. &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter&rsquo;s lips quirked at the stone-like feel in his gut at that question. Was Peter Petrelli safe to be around? God knows. He stood again to the gentle clink that filled his waking and sleeping hours.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t kill or rape you so that&rsquo;s a start. But you might want to move somewhere else even then.&rdquo; Peter spotted the main door open and the four-wheel motorbike began to putter through. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of a target here; you might get caught in the crossfire.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Ethan stood up and yeah, well over six feet in the next year or so. Peter resisted the urge to stand on tip-toe. &ldquo;They inject us every day to suppress our powers, how can there be a fight?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter smiled grimly as he took up his place at the edge of his perimeter.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need powers to fight, Ethan.&rdquo; Watching a FedMarshal lift a plastic box from the pile on his trailer and approach them, Peter folded his arms and asked. &ldquo;So, what ability did you have anyway?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ethan hunched his shoulders and looked curiously at the white box placed just out of the chain&rsquo;s reach. &ldquo;I can spit acid. It melted my dad&rsquo;s car door. Doesn&rsquo;t hurt my mouth though&hellip;.&rdquo; The youth&rsquo;s words tumbled into nothing as Peter spun sharply and seized his elbow in a firm grip.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter looked long into the boy&rsquo;s eyes to make sure there was no deceit, before looking behind them. Looking along the length of chain tethering Peter to the ground.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Chain made of steel.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">*****</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He had to pick his moment. After three months of survival and waiting Peter had found a chance. But he couldn&rsquo;t be too impatient to escape or he&rsquo;d make a critical error and be shot down in seconds. Determinedly ignoring the chain, Peter looked at the two plastic boxes five feet away and tried not to grind his teeth. Beside him Ethan looked confused, glancing at the chain and then back to Peter&rsquo;s face with a questioning expression.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Why&hellip;?&rdquo; the youth began to ask.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Ethan, could you please get the boxes?&rdquo; Peter interrupted in a low voice.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The boy&rsquo;s soft blue eyes now slid from the boxes to Peter and back. Good. The chain was being ignored.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Err, sure.&rdquo; Taking those three steps beyond Peter&rsquo;s circle of protection, the young man collected up the boxes and turned back. Unfortunately the movement was unusual enough to garner the attention of their fellow inmates. Drawing in a deep breath Peter guided Ethan to the wall at their left. Sitting he opened a box and began eating the food within.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Found a friend Fly-boy?&rdquo; Peter ignored the drawling suggestion and spoke quietly to Ethan between bites.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;I can get us out of here.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Blue eyed widened. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter looked anywhere but at his ankle. &ldquo;Why do you think they have me chained to the ground?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Um...I dunno.&rdquo; Connections made between the catcalls now floating towards them and the chain. &ldquo;You can fly? They chained you down so you can&rsquo;t escape. But, they give us the shots, to stop abilities.&rdquo; Ethan stared now at the chain in serious doubt. &ldquo;Why would they chain you if you get the shots?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter finished his food and carefully collected together everything of value he possessed.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Because the serum doesn&rsquo;t work on me. I took a similar drug a while ago and now I&rsquo;ve developed immunity.&rdquo; Standing again Peter did some quick stretches and looked around the compound. He&rsquo;d have maybe a five second window to get out of gun range. Plenty of time even with a passenger. It would be getting past the roof without too many inmates noticing that would be the challenge.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He&rsquo;d need a distraction.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;So you have your power&hellip;you can fly?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Hmmmm&hellip;yeah.&rdquo; Peter watched his most vile antagonist look over at them, curiosity and twisted lust colouring the gaunt features. Averting his gaze, the former nurse waited until the inevitable fight began. It would be over food as always. One man taking another&rsquo;s apple could lead to death in the North Internment Station.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;But <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t melt the chain without my power.&rdquo; Ethan stood at Peter&rsquo;s side.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to Ethan. The serum is only active for twenty-four hours, and then it starts to break down. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re due another injection soon. They come at the same time every day. Right.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s words slowed as he watched a punch get thrown on the far side of the arena. &ldquo;After.&rdquo; Four prisoners waded into the fray. &ldquo;Breakfast.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Looking up into the boy&rsquo;s worried gaze, Peter smiled for what felt like the first time in months. No, years.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t use your power Ethan,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;But I can.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Peter took Ethan&rsquo;s wrist and felt once again the brilliant rush of an ability flowing into him.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Crouching quickly, Peter lifted the chain until it was bare inches from his lips. He softly kissed the link and let the saliva on his tongue coat the cool metal. A faint puff of sour eggs and then Peter could see the acid begin to work. Inexorably the steel dissolved, bubbling and steaming until the link was completely gone.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Only a foot of chain now trailed from Peter&rsquo;s wounded ankle.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He wasn&rsquo;t tethered anymore.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Hold onto me.&rdquo; Peter ordered. Ethan complied immediately, arms circling his waist and chest in a reverse bear hug.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&lsquo;Hey Pretty!!&rdquo; The hated voice called too close for comfort. &ldquo;You letting that string-bean have ya?&nbsp;He&rsquo;s just a fuckin&rsquo; kid, ya wanna see what a man can do for ya?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Wishing he had the time to absorb a destructive power and fry the bastard with it, Peter sent his enemy a crooked grin and committed to memory the look of absolute shock that flowed over his face.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Looking into the sky Peter called up his memories of Nathan, the great and the terrible.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Then he flew again.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">*****</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ethan wouldn&rsquo;t let Peter take him home. With his parents gone there was only his little sister staying with their grandparents and the boy was loath to bring any danger to his surviving family. Peter couldn&rsquo;t help but agree, unfortunately that left him with a sixteen year old passenger that he had little doubt he&rsquo;d be able to protect if the FedMarshals managed to corner them. Fortunately, Ethan demonstrated his immediate usefulness by stealing some food and showing Peter how to shop-lift new clothes.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Obviously Peter had a far more sheltered upbringing than he&rsquo;d thought.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It took them three days flying due east with stops for sleep and for Peter to rest. Flying wasn&rsquo;t tiring at all; carrying a human weighing half again his body weight was going to dislocate Peter&rsquo;s shoulders if he didn&rsquo;t land every few hours.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It was near ten at night when they arrived in New York, the remains of the once glittering city still under marshal law. They would be shot on sight if spotted out after curfew. Keeping as much in the dark as possible, Peter led Ethan on foot through the deserted streets feeling his heart sink at the sight of burned-out cars and the litter-strewn side walk. This city was a duplicate of another horror New York he&rsquo;d once seen. Only minutes to see it before he&rsquo;d been stolen away and smothered with words like Shanti, Nathan, virus and ninety-three-percent-dead. That world had faded into nothing, along with a lilt-voiced girl and the possibility of another Peter.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">There was now only his broken city, the catastrophe that had caused it and Peter; once again, trying to stop something before it even began.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Ethan stayed quiet as they stopped in front of large, imposing gates. The massive fence hadn&rsquo;t been here the last time he&rsquo;d seen it, or the barbed wire. Peter took a deep steadying breath and stiffened his shoulders before opening the gate. In the eerie gloom of a silent New York, the gate shrieked from its un-oiled hinges and allowed them to enter. The front gardens were overgrown, abundant roses gone as wild as their blackberry cousins. Dodging vicious thorns, they approached the front doors, Peter breathing a sigh of either relief or fear at the lights he could spot upstairs.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Someone lived here.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Shuffling his hands into the pocket of his stolen coat, Peter found one of the few items he&rsquo;d managed to hold onto the last three months.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Fitting his key into the lock, Peter pushed open the door and walked into the house he&rsquo;d grown up in.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">It felt a little like watching Dorothy open her door onto the technicolour glory of Oz. The shabby, dilapidated outside a mask over the gleaming excellence of the Petrelli mansion. A foyer empty save for the marble statues his mother had gamely protected from two young sons and the warm glow of the ostentatious chandelier two floors above.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Breathing in the scent of wood polish and roses, Peter tensed as he heard footsteps along the upper landing and Ethan&rsquo;s awestruck gasp behind him.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">He looked up into the astonished face of his niece.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Almost silently Claire mouthed his name before she visibly inhaled and then, &ldquo;PETER!&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Quiet thumps as she belted down the stairs and he was moving too, unconsciously getting closer to this beloved girl, his friend and family all wrapped up together in the sweet-faced young woman in his arms. Claire was crying and laughing and saying his name over and over like a mantra.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive, you&rsquo;re alive&hellip;Peter, Peter, Peter&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">The smell of her hair, tiny form bouncing and hugging and the wet salt of tears on his neck had Peter feeling like he could wake up now because he was home and Claire was here. Familiar face in a world gone mad for three months.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">God, he&rsquo;d missed her.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">Small fists bunched into the lapels of Peter&rsquo;s coat as Claire pulled away to look up at him with eyes drowning green in her lovely face. Other sounds penetrated Peter&rsquo;s relief; footfalls clinking on marble, doors opening and a slow-rising babble of voices.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; she asked, but before he could answer&hellip;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 34.6pt 0pt 45pt"">&ldquo;Peter! Peter&hellip;&rdquo; He looked over to see his mother push past people he knows and loves, her hair liberally streaked with grey, her face wearing the same expression she&rsquo;d worn when he had just woken from a coma all those long months ago.

Kisses rained across his cheeks and touched his eyelids like a prayer. A smothered sob escaped Peter at the care inherent in her touch.

He's a little oblivious like that.</span><br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Green-eyed.""><p><u>Green-Eyed.</u></p><p>&ldquo;Bourbon? No?&nbsp;Whiskey?&rdquo; The friendly business man had taken to listing each bottle of liquor that he could see beyond the bar. He had snared the seat beside Peter nearly twenty minutes ago and was intent on buying the nurse-slash-saviour of humanity a drink. Despite being gently turned down at least seven times, the older man was persistent and actually rather charming. With sparkling blue eyes and sandy grey hair, he had a sort of Robert Redford thing going on. If Redford starting wearing thousand dollar suits and had haircuts that cost more than Peter earned in a month. <i>This is what Nathan will be like in fifteen years.</i> Peter smiled and shook his head at the offer of a &ldquo;Sambuca on ice?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t need another. Thanks.&rdquo; Tapping a finger against the chilled glass still in front of him, Peter glanced searchingly around the large room. The bar was packed to the polished wood beams with professional types crowding in for desperate Friday after-work alcohol.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, cut me some slack here? Just one drink?&rdquo; The blue eyes really were delightful. &ldquo;You never know babe, I could be your one and only! Let me buy you a drink and we can find out. I promise I&rsquo;m not a serial killer or anything. Scout&rsquo;s honour.&rdquo; &nbsp;Hand over heart and absolute honesty on the rugged, handsome features.</p><p>A gurgle of laughter bubbled from Peter, quickly smothered by the rim of the empty glass pressed against his lips.&nbsp;About to reply, the tumbler was stolen from his fingers by a dark-clad figure that loomed over the seated pair.</p><p>&ldquo;Pity. He only dates people with balls enough to brutally slaughter any rivals and play cat&rsquo;s cradle with their entrails.&rdquo; The deep, drawling voice penetrated the chaotic noise around them, causing a shiver at the back of Peter&rsquo;s neck like ice frosting his stolen glass.</p><p>The business man looked up into Sylar&rsquo;s cool, emotionless face and flinched at what he found there. Peter saw the flirtatious laughter drain from the blue eyes as the expected &lsquo;just joking&rsquo; never eventuated from Sylar. A glance at Peter who was putting his payment on the bar and the nurse could see the decision being reached behind that look. Weighing up any chance at Peter over the not-very-subtle threat emanating from Sylar. Not really surprised that any minor charms he possessed being unable to balance the silent &ldquo;Yes I will kill you and really, really, really enjoy it&rdquo; vibe that Sylar was exuding, the business man sighed theatrically and looked around for another potential bed mate.</p><p>Standing, Peter turned towards his lover and raised an enquiring eyebrow at the murderous flame still burning in the midnight eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Because he was after all, Peter.</p><p>Empathy didn&rsquo;t mean you were necessarily quick on the uptake. Particularly when you didn&rsquo;t notice you were being hit on until you realised that your thigh was being stroked in a way that might not be as casual as you first thought.</p><p>Murderous becoming even more deadly if that were possible, long fingers encircled his wrist and Peter was being lead through the crowd towards the exit. The people parted like the red sea at Sylar&rsquo;s silent direction. It was either telekinesis or just force of personality, but Peter spotted several suits yelping and rubbing their shoulders so decided it must be option A.</p><p>The crisp air cooled cheeks slightly flushed from the press of humanity inside as Sylar picked up speed, until Peter had to dance a little to keep up or have his hand pulled off.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked as the turned down the next alley. &ldquo;Sylar, I barely said a word to him.&rdquo; Explanations falling on deaf ears, Peter started to get angry with the silent, boorish mood his lover was in. It had been weeks since they last met, neither man having time from their rebellion against the government sanctions to even be in the same city, let alone spend it together. Now Sylar was being an asshole and they should be checking into a hotel for athletic sex rather then having a snarling match in a filthy alley.</p><p>Digging in his heels, Peter yanked back on Sylar&rsquo;s grip and wished he&rsquo;d copied Mohinder&rsquo;s strength before he left the stronghold rather than Claire&rsquo;s power.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a&hellip;&rdquo; But the sentence was never finished as Sylar turned sharply and crowded Peter backwards until he was pressed into the graffiti swirled brick behind him. Long fingers slid up into his hair and a hot, wet kiss punished Peter&rsquo;s lips. Anger still simmering but overshadowed by lust, Peter burrowed his hands under Sylar&rsquo;s coat and grabbed onto the belt loops at his lover&rsquo;s lean hips.</p><p>He barely got a chance to return the kiss, however, as the hands cradling his head roughly pushed his face to one side, exposing Peter&rsquo;s neck to the chill night air and the hard bite of Sylar&rsquo;s teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey...ow!!&rdquo; The small wound healed quickly, but that was hardly a play-nip. A second bite sent Peter up on his toes in both pain and the sudden rush of pleasure that hit his cock. A third bite that almost immediately healed. A torrent of swearing issued from Sylar&rsquo;s normally articulate tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;God dammed cheerleader, all over you to taker her power to keep you &lsquo;safe&rsquo; I&rsquo;m fucking sure&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Bristling at the abuse aimed at his lovely niece, Peter wrenched his head away from the grasping hands.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is wrong with&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take one of mine&hellip;now.&rdquo; The order was unmistakable, but Peter had spent his entire life being commanded by men with egos bigger than Texas and he hadn&rsquo;t ducked his head to either of them either.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck off.&rdquo;</p><p>Barely five inches between them, but Peter felt it widen to a chasm as he watched a riot of emotions cross the normally ice-perfect face of his dangerous lover. Genuinely lost as to the cause of this blow up, Peter crushed some of his anger down and looked at Sylar clearly for the first time that night.</p><p>Anger. Frustration. Desire. Exhaustion. Passion.</p><p>And shadowing all the others with its fierce, green tinted glint.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Reaching out, Peter brushed his finger-tips across that neat, sinful mouth. In a shimmer of power he gained the ability to turn lead into gold. Leaning back against the wall with a carelessness he didn&rsquo;t feel, Peter bit the corner of his lip in a way that he know drover his lover mad and said,</p><p>&ldquo;He was kind of cute actually. I wonder if he&rsquo;d buy me a drink if I went back inside.&rdquo; It was exactly the wrong thing to say&hellip;or the right one if you knew what would happen.</p><p>An old metal rubbish can flew violently from one side of the alley to the other and then crumpled into something close to the size of a soda can.</p><p>As understanding dawned in bitter chocolate eyes, Peter tilted his head invitingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Knock yourself out.&rdquo;</p><p>Sylar pounced, grabby hands curving under Peter&rsquo;s ass and lifting him onto his toes while a hard leg pressed between his thighs. An even harder erection ground against Peter&rsquo;s own, causing a sound to issue from him that was most likely a long wanton moan.</p><p>Of course the bites this time nearly broke the skin and Peter would look like he&rsquo;d been mauled by a dog tomorrow, but it was worth it. Worth it to feel his lover crush them so close together, to have their bodies thrust and push in a perfect rhythm that wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough.</p><p>So lost was he in the sensation of touch and being touched, that Peter didn&rsquo;t realise what he was hearing for several seconds. No more swearing, just one word over and over. Chanted into the skin of his neck and shoulder, across his cheekbone and slipped into his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Mine, mine, mine, mine&hellip;..&rdquo;</p><p>Something that felt like pain but was probably love curled in Peter&rsquo;s middle and he sucked sudden in air to his paralysed lungs in one painful sob. Twisting around, he deftly unbuckled his belt and then jeans, shoving the material down low enough to expose his ass and burning hard cock to the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck me, please&hellip;&rdquo; he spoke the harsh sounds into the dirty bricks and spread his fingers against the wall for balance. &ldquo;Prove it Gabriel, prove it. I want you, please. Fuck me, show me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Only seconds pass, Peter&rsquo;s voice desperate and slutty in the muted darkness of the alley. He keeps begging, keeps demanding. Then a warm, damp finger at his ass and his lover&rsquo;s mouth once again painting possession into Peter&rsquo;s throat with bruises.</p><p>Finally ready after long hot seconds, the relentless press of Sylar&rsquo;s iron shaft into his body. No finesse, just a long, hard ache of flesh that breaks Peter&rsquo;s voice and replaces it with the hard grind of fucking and love.</p><p>&ldquo;Mine, only for me, only mine.&rdquo; The dusky chant changes as Sylar fucks Peter open, only the wall to prevent him from collapse at the pleasure darting around his body.</p><p>&ldquo;For me, you&rsquo;re mine&hellip;never let you go&hellip;kill us first&hellip;kill them all first&hellip;keep you for me&hellip;I won you&hellip;never giving you back&hellip;.mine&hellip;kill them for you&hellip;kill them all&hellip;kill the world for you&hellip;mine&hellip;.mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>That is just too much for Peter to comprehend. Rational thought went out the window when he begged for Sylar to fuck him and dealing with the level of obsession he&rsquo;s hearing is well beyond him right now.</p><p>Now is about the silken slide of his lover in his ass, the hot breath in his ear and the fingers around his own rock-hard erection and the orgasm he can feel&hellip;about&hellip;to&hellip;take&hellip;him&hellip;apart.</p><p>Coming in wet, hard shudders, Peter feels Sylar go rigid and nearly tear a jugular in his passion.</p><p>Minutes later they are still slumped there. Peter almost invisible under his taller lover and the great black coat that keeps the cold at bay.</p><p>A long sighing breath and Sylar nuzzles gently at Peter&rsquo;s decorated skin. Calm now, the rage dissipated in teeth, sweat and cum.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Peter offers as he tips his head back to rest on one broad shoulder. &ldquo;No more smiling at strangers in bars right?&rdquo;</p><p>A soft chuckle in that beloved voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Not if you want them alive the next morning&hellip;no.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /><br />finis<br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut>"

This close to Christmas the mall was filled to bursting with shoppers all exuding seasonal cheer as they tried to ram their shopping carts into spaces far too small to accommodate them. Helen had been caught between a frantic family of six and a pile of discount DVD players when she&rsquo;d collapsed with an angina attack. David, her husband had called for help and now Peter was checking to make sure Helen could be with her family for Christmas. She has three daughters in Tulsa and does Peter have a number she can contact him on? Just in case her heart starts acting up again?<br /><br />&ldquo;You can call emergency anytime Helen,&rdquo; Peter assures her gently. Fingers ghosting over the equipment in his kit, counting and checking to make sure he isn&rsquo;t leaving something dangerous behind. Deliberately ignoring Mitchell&rsquo;s wide grin, Peter chats a little more about big family Christmas dinners that need to be cooked and how rude everyone is this time of year before being engulfed in a warm, coffee smelling hug. <br /><br />Mitchell is vibrating with laughter as they head back to their bus, the multitude moving out of their way in an unconscious respect for their uniforms. <br /><br />&ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; Peter orders with a faint blush. <br /><br />&ldquo;She would have proposed right there on the floor if her husband wasn&rsquo;t standing behind you.&rdquo; The bulky red-head teases, opening the ambulance door and climbing in. &ldquo;Although I think he was just as smitten, maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t introduce you to their daughters after all&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You are so funny Mitch, I&rsquo;m gonna need to give myself a shot just to calm down.&rdquo; Peter swings into the driver&rsquo;s seat and contemplates leaving Mitchell behind in the vehicular push and shove of the car park.<br /><br />The red-head settles in beside Peter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just too nice you know Petey-Pete? They tell you all about their lives and you eat it up like it&rsquo;s the most interesting thing in the world. You got to keep some distance you know? You&rsquo;ll burn out from feeling too much otherwise.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo; But Peter is non-committal. He genuinely likes talking to people, hearing their stories, getting to know them. After the crazed drama that has been his life for the past year, it&rsquo;s a nice change to relate to normal people with normal lives. <br /><br />As for burning out&hellip;been there, done that.<br /><br />******<br /><br />For Peter, Friday afternoon shift finishes at 8pm, allowing just enough time to get home, find something to eat and crash into bed. He has Saturdays off for the next six months and usually gets up early to make the most of his free time. Flicking his locks into place as he checks the mail, Peter tosses his keys onto the kitchen counter and opens the fridge. Eyeing some left-over pizza dubiously, Peter thinks he should call Clair to see what she is doing while visiting his mother, they could have dinner at&hellip;.<br /><br />Very, very slowly Peter closed the fridge door, his heart beginning to pound like poor Helen&rsquo;s.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hello Peter.&rdquo; <br /><br />Deep velvet voice that causes a shiver of both excitement and fear to race along his nerves.<br /><br />Turning carefully, Peter looks searchingly around the living room of his apartment until he spots a pocket of shadows beside the door to his bedroom. Something glints in the light from the kitchen.<br /><br />&ldquo;Sylar,&rdquo; he breathes.<br /><br />The shadows move and he can see black clad shoulders, some kind of long coat, and the slightly paler black of skin at around face height. Peter glances at his door, how many feet is it from where he&rsquo;s standing&hellip;or maybe&hellip;?<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never make it.&rdquo; Staggering confidence.<br /><br />Peter bristles; he&rsquo;s fought the killer to standstill <i>and</i> kicked his ass again at Primatech. <br /><br /><i>But that was before.</i><br /><br />Taking a long breath, Peter breaks and runs. All his fear and adrenaline channelled into a desperate sprint. But not for the door&hellip;for the window.<br /><br />He almost makes it. Shoulders curled in to take the impact of the glass, Peter sees a splash of yellow from headlights in the street below, just as a telekinetic band encircles his waist and he is wrenched backwards. Flat on the floor, Peter pushes and twists but he knows it&rsquo;s hopeless. The casual strength of Sylar&rsquo;s favourite power is horribly familiar to him, an almost citrus flavour to the press and crush of a killer&rsquo;s will. <br /><br />Refusing to fight anymore, he lays still and concentrates on keeping his fear under control.<br /><br />Ominous footsteps across his polished floorboards and then Gabriel Grey looms over him, his height magnified by Peter&rsquo;s supine position. Expecting either a razor pain on his forehead or a full body teke press, Peter is surprised when Sylar sinks down to sit cross-legged beside him, resting elbows on knees and giving the pinned nurse a once-over.<br /><br />&ldquo;Claire stabbed me in the head with a piece of glass&hellip;I thought of you.&rdquo; <br /><br />The light from the kitchen reveals Sylar&rsquo;s compelling face, strong brow currently furrowed in thought, black stubbled jaw and a wide neat mouth that under any other circumstances Peter would have considered intensely attractive. Of course &lsquo;other circumstances&rsquo; also assumes that the face&rsquo;s owner isn&rsquo;t about to butcher him on his new rug. <br /><br />&ldquo;She mentioned it.&rdquo; Not glass, anything but glass. <i>What do you do with something that killed you?</i> Peter didn&rsquo;t want to die at all, but having shards of glass near him during his work is beyond uncomfortable, glass and Sylar in the same room is terrifying. &ldquo;How did you..?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Fire melted it; lovely feeling it was too, healing fourth degree burns. But you know what that&rsquo;s like don&rsquo;t you Peter?&rdquo; Sylar always laces his name with a resonant curl, like he tastes it every time he shapes the letters with his lips.<br /><br />Wondering why he is asking questions of the psycho killer, Peter notices for the first time that he isn&rsquo;t held to the floor by a huge palm of power but more like a bug skewered by a needle. Only his hips and back are anchored; arms, legs and shoulders are free to move. Peter keeps himself as still as possible despite this as he isn&rsquo;t sure if the lack of pressure is deliberate or an oversight on the other&rsquo;s part.<br /><br />&ldquo;Why did you run toward the window Peter?&rdquo;<br /><br />Gaze locking with Sylar&rsquo;s bitter chocolate eyes, Peter bites his tongue.<br /><br />&ldquo;Because your fire escape isn&rsquo;t the most secure in the world,&rdquo; Sylar continues thoughtfully. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you try for the door? Hmmm, and you were running so fast&hellip;.Pe<i>ter</i>?&rdquo; A sing-song lilt has entered the velvet voice as thoughts whirl and connect behind the killer&rsquo;s eyes.<br /><br />&ldquo;Were you going to fly Peter?&rdquo;<br /><br /><i>Shit, shit, shit. Should have gone for the door.</i> Peter thinks desperately, &ldquo;Only one lock on the&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ly-<i>ing.</i>&rdquo; Now the telekinesis crawls up his chest to gently encircle his throat. &ldquo;You have a power, you can fly can&rsquo;t you Peter?&rdquo; Unmistakable glee.<br /><br />Now Peter begins to fight, kicking and pushing against the invisible force, reaching for Sylar. If he can just touch&hellip;<br /><br />&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be like that Peter.&rdquo; Sylar leans forward and whispers so close to Peter&rsquo;s ear he wonders if he can copy a power by that minimal contact. &ldquo;I would love to fly, but I don&rsquo;t want to take the risk. I didn&rsquo;t come to kill you and now that you&rsquo;re back among us with gifts well...&rdquo; a pause while Peter fights an involuntary shiver at the warm breath caressing the sensitive skin near his hairline. &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m still not going to kill you. Good bye Peter.&rdquo;<br /><br />Standing in one long graceful movement, Gabriel Grey walks to the window, heavy boots reverberating to where Peter lays trapped on the floor.<br /><br />&ldquo;You should eat more. Svelte is perfect on you, skinny is not.&rdquo;<br /><br />Peter watches for long seconds after the window closes behind the killer, slowly sitting up when the telekinetic hold finally disappears.<br /><br />&ldquo;The fuck?&rdquo;<br /><br />*****<br /><br />The following Friday is foretelling a particularly nasty winter ahead. Grey skies and a chill wind serve to throw everyone&rsquo;s karma into chaos, causing more brawls and accidents in one day than in the last month combined. Peter finishes dressing after a long hot shower and is wandering towards his kitchen when he notices a shadow on his fire escape. Holding still, he looks harder and determines that yes, indeed, there is a man sitting on his fire escape landing. <br /><br />In October. <br /><br />In the cold.<br /><br />Wishing he could be the kind of person to just drop the blinds and go on with his evening, Peter slides up the glass and leans against the white window frame. Chances are better for him exposed to the open sky anyway and it&rsquo;s not as if the guy couldn&rsquo;t have just barged in like he had the previous week.<br /><br />&ldquo;Should I even ask?&rdquo; He questions as goose bumps not entirely from the cold pebble his skin.<br /><br />In the light from Peter&rsquo;s apartment, Sylar looks relaxed, elbows on raised knees, head resting comfortably against the cold iron of the hand rail. A polite smile graces the serial killer&rsquo;s lips as midnight eyes wander over Peter&rsquo;s form.<br /><br />&ldquo;You were a little bit upset last time I came in without an invitation, so&hellip;&rdquo; The smile takes on a taunting edge as Peter processes the concept of being &lsquo;a little bit upset&rsquo; about last week&rsquo;s home invasion. <br /><br />&ldquo;So you decided to linger outside my window in the freezing cold instead?&rdquo; He can&rsquo;t keep the disbelief out of his voice, because there is no way in hell Sylar is actually being considerate of Peter&rsquo;s personal space.<br /><br />Sylar shrugs with an inherent grace Peter is suddenly fiercely envious of. How dare such an attractive creature be such a monster? If his heart-rate wasn&rsquo;t climbing with slow-crawling fear, it would likely being doing it from proximity to the dark clad man anyway. Crossing his arms, Peter starts to rub them to create some warmth and to banish the chill of fear as well as desire.<br /><br />Dark eyes watch the movement, long fingers flick suddenly and Peter stiffens in surprise. But the citrus caress of power doesn&rsquo;t touch him; instead he feels a gentle thump as his winter coat, discarded onto his sofa earlier lands across his shoulders.<br /><br />&ldquo;In or out Peter, you&rsquo;re letting the warmth go, hovering there like a nervous colt.&rdquo; The smile is gone and dark eyes look away from Peter, down the alley towards the lights of the traffic beyond. <br /><br />Pushing his arms into the sleeves, Peter climbs through the window. Unable to hide his caution he avoids being too close and settles down with his back against the brick of his building, sock-clad feet near Sylar&rsquo;s big boots but not touching. Crossing his arms tightly he feels the cold creep into the fabric of his jeans and wonders what the hell is going on.<br /><br />In a frightening display of intuition that Peter would suspect is telepathy if Matt hadn&rsquo;t called him this morning, Sylar answers Peter&rsquo;s thought.<br /><br />&ldquo;When Angela told me I was your brother I thought I had finally found a reason for being.&rdquo; The words are clear; unemotional even delivered in velvet beauty. &ldquo;A family to be a part of, parents I could respect, brothers to share the world with.&rdquo;<br /><br />Peter clenches his teeth against a sudden burst of disgust. His mother had certainly used a very powerful weapon against the man next to him, the lure of family to control someone who is essentially uncontrollable.<br /><br />&ldquo;A family that spends more time fighting than sharing Sylar.&rdquo; He corrects sharply, unwilling to hear praise of the flawed ensemble. &ldquo;We yell and snipe, insult and interfere in each others lives. Petrelli is Italian for manipulate you know. You met my father.&rdquo;<br /><br /><i>&lsquo;And killed him with me.&rsquo;</i> Peter&rsquo;s conscience supplies ruthlessly.<br /><br />Sylar looks back at the bitterness lacing Peter&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I would have fit right in then, wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;<br /><br />Peter ignores the question. &ldquo;I never thought you were my brother. Mom could rival Lindeman for pulling strings, but she is ferociously protective of us. She keeps trying to steal Claire away to Europe to keep her safe.&rdquo; A fond smile rises to his lips at the thought of his adored niece. &ldquo;There is no way she would let Dad take away a child of hers...no way.&rdquo;<br /><br />Looking over, Peter catches Sylar staring at his mouth and ducks his head self-consciously. Lately he&rsquo;s rarely bothered with his appearance and it&rsquo;s unsettling to feel aware like this with Sylar the Crazed Murderer for God&rsquo;s sake. Sternly ordering himself to get a grip, Peter sneaks a glance and finds another smile crossing the strong handsome features.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad now that we&rsquo;re not brothers Peter.&rdquo; The velvet voice goes a seductive tone deeper. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say that brotherly feelings would have been a poor substitute for what&rsquo;s between us.&rdquo;<br /><br />Peter blinked. &ldquo;Blood, death and violence you mean?&rdquo; <br /><br />Gabriel Gray laughs out loud. A gorgeous shock of sound that moves blood from Peter&rsquo;s extremities to other vital areas and echoes delightfully down to the street below.<br /><br />&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; chuckling, Sylar rises to his feet in one fluid movement and Peter scrambles up so that he can&rsquo;t be loomed over. Not anymore than normal anyway. A warm hand catches his elbow and steadies him. Stunned Peter doesn&rsquo;t even think to flinch away.<br /><br />&ldquo;But not anymore, I haven&rsquo;t wanted to kill you in, well&hellip;it&rsquo;s been months Peter.&rdquo; <br /><br />It has been. Peter was the one responsible for most of the aggression in their recent encounters.<br /><br />&ldquo;Going to fly?&rdquo; The question seems innocent, until Peter looks into midnight eyes seeing a feral light deep within.<br /><br />&ldquo;I never said I could fly.&rdquo; <br /><br />Fingers dropping from Peter&rsquo;s arm, Gabriel steps back, face suddenly closed, eyes going hard.<br /><br />Peter regrets the words, but&hellip;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too cold anyway.&rdquo; He confesses, looking back into the warmth of his apartment, then glancing up to see triumph light the taller man&rsquo;s features.<br /><br />&ldquo;Stay warm Peter.&rdquo; A hand reaches forward and Peter holds still as long, strong fingers twitch the collar of his coat into place then caress down his arm and wrist.<br /><br />Peter sways forward at the touch, only to find Sylar rising up, the scent of citrus in the air as powerful telekinesis lifts him up to the roof and away.<br /><br />Shivering from a combination of cold and several other feelings, Peter climbs back in his window. Everything Sylar said was twined with some other meaning that Peter will review again and again until he can understand what is going through the killer&rsquo;s mind.<br /><br />Why was he visiting Peter without intention of violence? Why linger in his home, then the next week hover outside his window in the chill of late fall?<br /><br />What is going on?<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Waking slowly to the delicious feel of cool clean sheets, Peter sighs in the bliss a shift-worker feels when realising he doesn&rsquo;t have to go back to work for hours yet. Thursday evening is assigned as apartment cleaning time and fresh laundered linen rustles gently as Peter stretches and curls his toes in smooth cotton. Cracking an eyelid he notices that it&rsquo;s well past sunrise and he should probably be doing something useful before his shift, but given he had two fatalities in the last 36 hours he decides that he deserves to be lazy for a change.<br /><br />Rolling onto his stomach, Peter rubs a pesky itch on his nose into the pillow before settling in for another long sleep. Opening his eyes to check the time on his alarm clock, Peter&rsquo;s breathe freezes in his throat with sudden agonising fright as he sees <i>Sylar lying beside him on the bed.</i><br /><br />Sylar lying beside him on the bed.<br /><br />Gabriel Grey, clothed in his typical midnight attire, booted feet crossed at the ankles, chin in hand as he causally watches Peter die of shock right in front of him.<br /><br />Sylar in his bed.<br /><br />Sylar. In. His. Fucking. Bed!!<br /><br />With an sharp indrawn breath that scalds his throat, Peter rears back from the serial killer <i>in his bed,</i> and stumbles to the floor then to the wall before regaining full control of his limbs and accelerated heart rate. <br /><br />&ldquo;What the&hellip;? You can&rsquo;t just&hellip;Get out you maniac!&rdquo; Ignoring in the fact that he sounds hysterical, Peter manages to summon a truly massive glare and aims it directly at his unwelcome visitor.<br /><br />What can only be described as a smirk graces Sylar&rsquo;s lips, dark eyes wandering from Peter&rsquo;s naked feet, up his pyjama clad legs and bare chest to the tangled mess of his hair. If Peter didn&rsquo;t know any better he would swear the killer had just checked him out. A shiver trails down his spine at the idea.<br /><br />&ldquo;You just run through every emotion on high speed don&rsquo;t you Peter?&rdquo; Sylar does the complete opposite of Peter&rsquo;s demand and sprawls across the bed, head on the pillow Peter just vacated, feet almost reaching over the far edge. Resting his cheek on the slightly dented cotton, Gabriel sends a wicked look at Peter through his lashes as he takes a long deep breath in through his nose.<br /><br />In a re-run of last week&rsquo;s emotional shock, Peter realises he can&rsquo;t force Sylar to do anything. Standing three feet away and giving orders is about as effective as stamping his foot and probably just as humiliating. Turning on his heel Peter snatches a long-sleeved t-shirt off his cabinet and heads for the kitchen. Sylar may get his kicks out of invading other people&rsquo;s privacy, doesn&rsquo;t mean Peter has to stand here and watch him.<br /><br />Only a few minutes later, Peter is staring thoughtfully at two mugs on his kitchen counter as footsteps precede his guest into the kitchen. Not even looking away from the boiling kettle, Peter asks,<br /><br />&ldquo;Are you going to kill me?&rdquo;<br /><br />The scrape of one of his chairs being pulled out from the breakfast nook.<br /><br />&ldquo;Not today Peter.&rdquo; Sylar&rsquo;s dark velvet voice is magnified in its beauty by Peter being unable to see the man.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hurt or threaten me? Wreck my stuff? Make me late for work?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;No Peter. Should I promise?&rdquo; A thread of amusement sprinkled through the velvet now. Peter suppresses an answering smile. Turning around he gestures to the steaming mugs in front of him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Coffee then?&rdquo; He knows he sounds wary and why not? He&rsquo;s entertaining a murderer.<br /><br />Something that could only be called surprise crosses Sylar&rsquo;s strong features, brows arched suddenly, lips parting in a way that Peter argues with himself isn&rsquo;t as appealing as it looks.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes. Thank you.&rdquo; Manners that must have been ingrained since birth come to the fore and Peter winces at the courtesy shown him. <br /><br />This is getting just a bit surreal.<br /><br /><i>A bit?</i><br /><br />Taking a long drink of his own wickedly black coffee, Peter watches the other man as colliding emotions finally come to an accord. Sylar isn&rsquo;t going to hurt him. Hasn&rsquo;t laid a finger on him in their last half-dozen or so meetings and actively helped him during the chaos of Pinehurst. So what the fuck does that mean? Peter just can&rsquo;t really maintain fear of the man anymore and that is likely a dangerous, dangerous thing. <br /><br />Sylar coughs uncomfortably and Peter realises he must have been staring at the man&rsquo;s mouth while he was drinking. Hoping to God his cheeks aren&rsquo;t colouring, Peter drags his eyes upwards and sees Sylar looking away, gazing out the window as he toys with the small chip in the mug&rsquo;s handle.<br /><br />What the hell was Gabriel Grey doing here? That he would break in and ruthlessly impose himself, then feel uncomfortable with basic hospitality?<br /><br />Peter has to find out.<br /><br />&ldquo;Please understand I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you,&rdquo; he reassures Sylar, setting his cup aside and straightening from a slouch on the bench.<br /><br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Head snapping back to him, Sylar&rsquo;s gaze becomes sharp, standing so quickly the cup spins a moment on the counter. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hurt me Peter; I thought we&rsquo;d established that.&rdquo; <br /><br />Somehow he holds his ground when Sylar steps closer, using his height to loom in a way that Peter, now his fear has abated, finds really, really irritating. Tossing his head a little to keep the hair out of his eyes, Peter looks up those few important inches and replies,<br /><br />&ldquo;I know it won&rsquo;t last, but I remember when I had Claire&rsquo;s ability and I&rsquo;ve got a few hours at least&hellip;&rdquo; words cut off as long fingers grab his upper arms in a crushing grip that will leave bruises later no doubt. <br /><br />&ldquo;What won&rsquo;t last Peter? What have you&hellip;?&rdquo; That ferocious intelligence clinks into place, bitter chocolate eyes find the coffee mug on the breakfast nook and return to Peter full of accusation. For some reason he can&rsquo;t explain, Peter&rsquo;s gut churns with guilt.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I have to know what&rsquo;s going on with you&hellip;.&rdquo;<br /><br />Fingers gone from his skin, Sylar turns too fast and stumbles against the door frame as he makes for the living room.<br /><br />&ldquo;I promise I won&rsquo;t let you be hurt.&rdquo; Peter vows as he follows the staggering villain. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;<br /><br />When Sylar finally collapses just shy of the front door, Peter crouches down beside him and carefully checks his pulse. Strong and steady. Not entirely confident he has as many hours as he would like, Peter snatches up the phone and wonders how he&rsquo;s going to get the bigger man off his floor.<br /><br />*****<br /><br /><br />Two hours later, Peter has clean teeth, neat hair, an ex-cop and a geneticist in his living room.<br /><br />Oh and a drugged up serial killer.<br /><br />&ldquo;Peter I cannot tell you how dangerous this is. We should call Noah and let him take care of everything.&rdquo; Mohinder reminds him with his gentle intensity. It&rsquo;s fairly decent of the man to even be helping them considering the immense hatred the scientist feels for Sylar.<br /><br />&ldquo;I know Mohinder, but there is something going on with Sylar and I need to know what it is.&rdquo; Peter had called in his reinforcements as soon as he was sure the killer was out cold. Matt had agreed in a heartbeat, Mohinder tagging along because if it involved Gabriel Grey then it involved him. &ldquo;Besides, Bennet is retired, doesn&rsquo;t even have anywhere to keep him now. I don&rsquo;t even know if anyone can hold Sylar with all the powers he has.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You caught him,&rdquo; Matt tells Peter, adjusting and checking the weapons, all but one of which will be useless if everything doesn&rsquo;t go according to plan.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Peter can&rsquo;t even explain why he feels so bad about that. Maybe the expression on Sylar&rsquo;s face when Peter had offered the coffee, like he&rsquo;d never had anyone make him a drink before.<br /><br />Shoving his feelings aside to be examined at excruciating length later, Peter takes his position just behind Matt&rsquo;s shoulder and readies the syringe in his hand. Mohinder stands behind the chair Peter has hauled the killer into, long-bladed hunting knife inches from Sylar&rsquo;s skull, ready in case everything goes to hell. <br /><br />As it probably will.<br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, in I go.&rdquo; Matt declares and sits forward in his seat directly in front of Sylar. It&rsquo;s a credit to his immense courage that when Peter asked him to telepathically enter a serial killer&rsquo;s mind there was only three seconds of hesitation. That and the promise of a tranquiliser in the bicep if Matt starts freaking out and trying to kill anyone.<br /><br />For Peter it only takes about ten minutes. His own experience with Matt&rsquo;s power is one of simple influence rather than scanning so he has no idea how much time passes for Matt and Sylar, but from the way Matt keeps leaning forward and Sylar&rsquo;s occasional jolts, it isn&rsquo;t quick or pleasant.<br /><br />&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; Mohinder&rsquo;s knuckles have gone white around the knife handle.<br /><br />&ldquo;Just a little more time Mohinder, Matt said he&rsquo;d come out and give us an update, just wait till then. Please?&rdquo; What would he do if Mohinder tried to stab Sylar&hellip;stop him? God Peter what the fuck have got yourself into?<br /><br />&ldquo;Whoa, that hurts,&rdquo; Matt growls, leaning back and releasing Sylar from his mental attack. <br /><br />&ldquo;Matt?&rdquo; Mohinder&rsquo;s voice reveals his stress.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, no Mohinder I&rsquo;m fine. Don&rsquo;t do it yet.&rdquo; Rubbing his face hard with both hands, Matt looks up at Peter. &rdquo;You&rsquo;re right, there is something very wrong in his mind, but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a new kind of wrong or if he&rsquo;s always been this way.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Can you heal it?&rdquo; Peter keeps his emotions firmly under wraps.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know...maybe.&rdquo; Matt looks thoughtfully back at the slumped figure in front of him.<br /><br />Mohinder shakes his head in the negative. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too risky. This whole idea is insane.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know Mohinder,&rdquo; Peter agrees, it isn&rsquo;t Matt he has to convince, it&rsquo;s the doctor. &ldquo;But right now we only have one way of stopping him, &ldquo; a gesture towards the huge blade in Mohinder&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;If Matt can do anything to heal Sylar from the inside, then stabbing a man in the head isn&rsquo;t necessary.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;He killed you.&rdquo; The words are stark in their truth.<br /><br />Peter tastes the memory of blood in his mouth. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I watched him do it. I carried your body to your mother and witnessed her face when she saw you. He killed my father and over a dozen others, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be helped Peter.&rdquo;<br /><br />No, he doesn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; Matt takes the argument away from them both.<br /><br />&ldquo;Matt please...&rdquo; Mohinder begins.<br /><br />But the stocky policeman holds up his hand. &ldquo;I saw more of his victims than either of you and I know what he did to each and every one of them. I have a chance to fix this, to repair whatever damaged this man and I&rsquo;m going to take it.&rdquo; Even Mohinder closes his mouth at the tone of promise coming from Matt. &ldquo;But keep those ready just in case.&rdquo;<br /><br />A last lingering look into Mohinder&rsquo;s eyes and then Matt puts his concentration squarely into the battle for a man&rsquo;s sanity.<br /><br />Only a moment or two later Sylar starts to jerk, his whole body reacting to Matt&rsquo;s attempt at healing.<br /><br />&ldquo;Come back here Gabriel, don&rsquo;t run.&rdquo; Matt mutters under his breath. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to fix them all, you know how they work now.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Get out.&rdquo; Slurred from the unconscious man&rsquo;s lips.<br /><br />&ldquo;Matt, he&rsquo;s waking up.&rdquo; Peter warns, finger&rsquo;s tightening on the needle.<br /><br />&ldquo;You already know why&hellip;not your parents, you didn&rsquo;t need to&hellip;it isn&rsquo;t broken.&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s one sided conversation continues.<br /><br />Long fingers, once relaxed, suddenly fist and all the books in Peter&rsquo;s apartment fall to the floor.<br /><br />&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s not broken&hellip;you can&rsquo;t&hellip;ahhh, there it is&hellip;almost&hellip;.but it&rsquo;s so simple Gabriel you could&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />A full-body flinch and doors rip off their hinges, hang suspended in midair like balloons.<br /><br />&ldquo;&hellip;Gabriel&hellip;you only get to have him if you fix the problem&hellip;the hunger is the problem&hellip;.&rdquo;<br /><br />Sylar&rsquo;s head lifts, his eyes open and fix on Matt&rsquo;s face.<br /><br />Mohinder pulls his arm back, blade catching the sunlight and refracting a thousand times across the room.<br /><br />&ldquo;&hellip;Gabriel it&rsquo;s broken&hellip;FIX IT!&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s command echoes through all their heads as Sylar stands up, eyes blazing with fury. Matt, returned to the present, is flung across the room, Mohinder pressed with equal force to the wall behind him.<br /><br />A single flick of the hand and the hypodermic in Peter&rsquo;s fingers is embedded in a nearby floating door. The citrus thrill of Sylar&rsquo;s telekinesis catches his throat and lifts him with careless ease. Tugged up and forward until they are nose to nose, Peter claws at his strangled neck.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m going to punish you for this Peter.&rdquo; The once-velvet voice is raw with murderous intent.<br /><br />Peter gasps in enough air for a few words. &ldquo;Did&hellip;you&hellip; do&hellip; it? Fix&hellip;it?&rdquo;<br /><br />A slight head tilt as the killer looks inwardly for a moment. Midnight eyes widen.<br /><br />&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; But the invisible grip had robbed Peter of air; the world goes smudgy around the edges.<br /><br />&ldquo;Whatever you did, I&rsquo;m going to come back and make you pay. Very. Slowly.&rdquo; The threat is whispered against his lips. Peter hears it just before the world goes grey and all is swallowed in the sound of shattering glass.<br /><br />******<br /><br />Four weeks later, Peter closes the door behind his guest and almost nervously crosses to his kitchen. Pulling down two coffee mugs he flicks on the kettle and pastes on a smile for the other man.<br /><br />&ldquo;Nice place Pete, you live here long?&rdquo; Tom stands at ease near Peter&rsquo;s book shelf, looking at the small items that make up one man&rsquo;s life, probably wondering what they each represent.<br /><br />Shrugging, Peter makes coffee and forces his mind away from the memory of the last time he&rsquo;d made hot drinks for two. &ldquo;A few years.&rdquo;<br /><br />Now that he has Tom back to his home, he feels unaccountably shy. The cop had asked him out months ago, but Peter hadn&rsquo;t accepted till recently. Hadn&rsquo;t even thought about seeing anyone while the threat of Sylar&rsquo;s return lingered in his thoughts. The first Friday after what Peter now terms the Cosmic Matt Telepathy Fuck Up, he&rsquo;d had Noah Bennet stationed on his couch with several deadly firearms and many, many sharp pieces of metal. It had come to nothing. <br /><br />Sylar hadn&rsquo;t showed.<br /><br />Embarrassed but relieved, Peter had thanked a disappointed Bennet and then survived a fraught week of paranoia until the bespectacled man had returned unasked the following Thursday. Still no sign of the serial killer and Peter felt his fear recede. Now filled with more information about guns than he ever wants to know, Peter has resumed his normal schedule and accepted Tom the Cop&rsquo;s invitation to dinner.<br /><br />Sylar had probably lost whatever weird interest he&rsquo;d had in the nurse anyway and was off terrorising some other part of the country. Of course that meant Peter is smote with guilt about letting the man go free when he could have ended him. But that guilt is useful in smothering a smaller one regarding certain hotly inappropriate thoughts about the touch of Sylar&rsquo;s lips and the look of intent in his eyes during their last encounter.<br /><br />Tom, funny, tall, blond and built, was a gorgeous alternative to Peter&rsquo;s right hand and the fading scent of a serial killer on his pillow. An option that would move to an even better level of distraction if they could get through coffee without Peter freaking out or calling the other man Gabriel by accident.<br /><br />Fingers tickling down his ribs knocks Peter from his thoughts, bringing him back to the very real, very nice man in his apartment. <br /><br />&ldquo;Show me your bedroom?&rdquo; Gentle words whisper into his ear, lips touch Peter&rsquo;s neck in small, soft kisses. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;<br /><br />Turning into the circle of the other man&rsquo;s arms, Peter leans up and kisses Tom, eyes closing on the handsome friendly face. <br /><br />The wrong face.<br /><br />Just as Peter deepens the kiss, opening his mouth to a courteous tongue, Tom&rsquo;s mouth is&hellip;gone. Hands that had been lingering on Peter&rsquo;s ass pull away so violently he staggers forward with their momentum.<br /><br />Shocked, Peter looks up into the brilliant midnight eyes of Sylar and feels his heart freeze in his chest.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill him now Peter and you get to <i>watch.</i>&rdquo; Smokey velvet voice promising horror as Peter throws himself in front of Sylar and catches sight of&hellip;<i>god...no</i>...Tom&rsquo;s spread eagled form telekinetically pinned to his ceiling. <br /><br />&ldquo;You are not going to hurt him you nutcase.&rdquo; Peter rages, stupidly jumping, trying to reach the poor man above him. Tom&rsquo;s eyes are wide with terror and disbelief. &ldquo;Let him down Sylar, he&rsquo;s a fucking cop!&rdquo;<br /><br />Sylar stands unmoving, rage filled eyes on Peter.<br /><br />&ldquo;A cop? That just shows your appalling physiological need for an authority figure Peter. Why didn&rsquo;t you fuck Parkman if you needed someone with a badge.&rdquo; Scorn infuses every word, spilling into the room and staining Peter with its lash.<br /><br />Giving up on the jumping as useless, Peter strides directly into Sylar&rsquo;s space and snarls in his face.<br /><br />&ldquo;First, don&rsquo;t even <i>think</i> about judging my emotional issues Mr Unbalanced Freak, second, who I fuck is so very much none of your business, third, Matt&rsquo;s with Mohinder as if you didn&rsquo;t know and fourth, let him the fuck down now before I&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />Tom shoots Sylar in the head.<br /><br />Stunned and slightly deafened from the sound, Peter looks up from the killer&rsquo;s body to see his almost-boyfriend come crashing to the floor, gun held in a sure grip. In a bizarre thought Peter realises that it would have to have been an awesome shot from the ceiling at that angle.<br /><br />Helping the policeman to stand, he hurries, &ldquo;You have to leave Tom, he&rsquo;s going to get up in a minute.&rdquo;<br /><br />A warm hand cups Peter&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead Pete, he&rsquo;s not getting up. I&rsquo;ll call it in&hellip;&rdquo; Concerned blue eyes, still touched by fear gaze into his, then widen comically as they look beyond him. Peter can sympathise, Claire&rsquo;s gift is one hell of a showstopper.<br /><br />He whirls around and faces Sylar directly, keeping his body between the two men. Hopefully Tom won&rsquo;t panic and shoot him in the back by accident.<br /><br />Gabriel spits out the bullet that had shattered his cheekbone and drops it on the floor.<br /><br />&ldquo;Cute.&rdquo; Peter acknowledges sassily. &ldquo;Now get out Sylar, before a million cops come to check that gunshot.&rdquo;<br /><br />Sylar straightens to his full height and glares at Tom. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br /><br />The click of a safety causes a tingle between Peter&rsquo;s shoulder-blades. Crap. This will get even bloodier if he doesn&rsquo;t get rid of one of them. Turning he catches Tom&rsquo;s gun hand and lowers it to point the weapon at the floor.<br /><br />&ldquo;What the fuck <i>is</i> he Pete&hellip;?&rdquo; The tremble in the cop&rsquo;s voice is very real and suddenly Peter feels like shit. <br /><br />&ldquo;Tom, please. He&rsquo;s an old&hellip;friend, and he&hellip;just&hellip;you need to leave.&rdquo; What the hell can he say to get a very noble, very decent man to leave him alone with an undead felon? &ldquo;I can handle it, I promise, I&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />Sylar takes over Peter&rsquo;s deteriorating argument.<br /><br />&ldquo;Go home Tom the Cop. Go home feeling drunk and nauseous and call in sick tomorrow.&rdquo; The deep velvet of Sylar&rsquo;s voice takes on a strange resonance that makes Peter&rsquo;s teeth itch. &ldquo;This night never happened, you never took Peter out, you never touched him and if you even look at him again I&rsquo;ll remove your balls and force them down your throat.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter blinks at Tom&rsquo;s dreamy blue eyes and slack mouth. &ldquo;What are&hellip;?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; The blond nods helpfully before holstering his weapon and turning to the door.<br /><br />&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; Peter calls, catching the other man by the arm and looking him in the eye. But Tom looks straight through him, eyes turning to Sylar with a slight wince. Letting go, Peter backs away and watches a good man leave his apartment without a backward glance.<br /><br />Turning around he glares all his anger at someone who is in no way a good man.<br /><br />&ldquo;Who did you kill for that one?&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t own the disappointment that laces his voice. Ridiculous to have hoped that Matt was successful all those weeks ago, but still he had wanted to believe.<br /><br />&ldquo;My father.&rdquo; Peter blinks in surprise. &ldquo;Right after I pulled out the arrows he shot into me, I decided that killing him was good for society as well as for me.&rdquo;<br /><br />Appalled, Peter just stares at the other man before his anger comes rushing back like a hurricane.<br /><br />&ldquo;Get out.&rdquo; He hisses.<br /><br />Fury that equals his own rises into midnight eyes. <br /><br />&ldquo;Make me.&rdquo; Sylar responds, something delicious and deadly in his tone.<br /><br />&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; Peter turns sharply on his heel and makes to follow Tom. Hand on the lock he is caught by the waist, spun and lifted, back forced hard to the door with a very tall, very angry Gabriel Grey pressed full length to his body. Fury fuelled now by instant desire, Peter draws in a sharp, painful breath and rakes his fingers through Sylar&rsquo;s thick dark hair, pulling two harsh handfuls, nearly scalping the man.<br /><br />Sylar retaliates, a strong hand grabbing the back of Peter&rsquo;s neck, tilting his head to the left as the killer leans inexorably forward. Dark strands catch under Peter&rsquo;s fingernails as he squirms, the small pain unnoticed by Sylar&rsquo;s relentless intent. Soft lips trace along his collarbone and throat, leaving aching heat in their wake and Peter&rsquo;s fingers relax their death grip. The beginning of a moan works its way from Peter&rsquo;s lungs.<br /><br />Then Gabriel bites down&hellip;<i>hard.</i><br /><br />Back arching at the sudden pain, Peter&rsquo;s moan turns into a grunt and he rams a thumb into Sylar&rsquo;s eye socket.<br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I like you so much Peter,&rdquo; Sylar grits out as his bruised and damaged eye quickly heals. &ldquo;I want to kill you almost as much as I want to&hellip;&rdquo; <br /><br />This time the stiff fingers hit him in the larynx and Peter suddenly feels a burst of citrus energy as telekineses takes over holding him to the door, while long fingers claw at a useless windpipe. Gabriel still has denim clad thighs pressed between Peter&rsquo;s legs and one hand on his hip, but the weight of his body has shifted backwards.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you want.&rdquo; Peter states, refusing to fight the teke, refusing to give Sylar the satisfaction of seeing him struggle. <br /><br />&ldquo;Liar.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s gasped and small, but clear.<br /><br />Peter looks into pained midnight eyes and feels his anger boil over. Anger at this situation, anger at Tom for leaving, anger at Sylar for being a murderer and most of all anger at himself for almost not caring, for being hard as rock at the touch of Gabriel&rsquo;s body on his. For the deep, entrenched passion he feels even though it shocks his soul every time. He wants, needs and lusts over the very antithesis of his being and Peter feels impossible rage at himself for being so weak.<br /><br />Grabbing two handfuls of heavy black woollen coat, Peter pulls Sylar forward and forces a kiss. Angry, harsh he feels soft lips tear under his teeth, taste of copper on his tongue before the small wound closes. Peter lets his rage fuel the touch, sends all that passion forwards until his mind clears and he becomes aware of what he&rsquo;s doing.<br /><br />Sylar stands completely still, unresponsive. <br /><br />Then&hellip;<br /><br />&hellip;the smell of citrus. Telekinesis rising like a great wave, building around them until Peter can perceive it even with his eyes half-closed. Almost smothered by the weight of power, a pressing intent of such strength curling like a long sinuous ribbon around Peter&rsquo;s hands and arms. <br /><br />Sylar strikes.<br /><br />Hands all over Peter, moving continuously from shoulder to flank, body crowding him further into the unrelenting wood of the door. And Sylar&rsquo;s lips, not just returning the kiss but&hellip;<i>owning</i> Peter&rsquo;s mouth, consuming him with heat and wet, tongue tracing his teeth until Peter feels the hot pulse of release begin to coarse from his chest to his toes and back up. The blood carrying fire to where his cock is trapped against an equally interested partner, denim and cloth unlovely friction as Sylar&rsquo;s hips rock into his.<br /><br />One roaming hand catches under Peter&rsquo;s knee and lifts it high over Sylar&rsquo;s hip, while the other slides down the back of his pants, helpfully unbuckling themselves to allow the movement. Long fingers curve over Peter&rsquo;s ass, cupping and holding him in place.<br /><br />Feeling the hard grind, Peter arches his back, meeting Sylar&rsquo;s thrust and tightening his fingers on black lapels, holding on under the relentless adoration of Sylar&rsquo;s passion.<br /><br />The need rises faster as Peter wrenches his head back to gasp in a vital breath and Sylar descends to his neck biting again and again. Tipping his face to allow more, Peter looks up at his ceiling, craving more contact, more pressure on his cock, more heat, more touch, more everything.<br /><br />Sudden blinding frisson of shock. Peter feels his body flood with power, nothing sexual in it at all.<br /><br />He stares numbly at his bare hand curled once again in thick dark hair.<br /><br />Gabriel has stopping moving; body a taut bowstring as realisation dawns. His head lifts and as midnight eyes lock onto Peter&rsquo;s he knows that explanations just aren&rsquo;t going to cut it.<br /><br />&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; Peter gasps at last. <br /><br />Sylar&rsquo;s eyes widen from curiosity to abject disbelief as he is flung across the room and out the window. Stolen powers flare as the glass slams back into place, Peter lands on his feet and the bites on his neck begin to heal. <br /><br />&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; Peter repeats quietly as he watches Elle&rsquo;s electricity flicker across his fingers.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Peter leans back against the door and lets his keys dangle from his fingers. He hadn&rsquo;t been sure what to expect, driving home from work tonight. After last Friday&rsquo;s encounter he felt sure that if Gabriel returned it would be as an aggressor rather than a suitor. Sylar was not the kind of man who would tolerate his powers being copied, particularly not by Peter.<br /><br />So, the gentle clink of metal is the only sound in his apartment as Peter looks at the intruder on his couch. Long legs crossed at the ankle, head comfortably pillowed on a cushion braced against the sofa arm, Gabriel looks as relaxed as Peter has ever seen him.<br /><br />It looks like he&rsquo;s been there for hours.<br /><br />&ldquo;I talked to a friend of mine about you.&rdquo; The reclining man offers as if they were continuing a conversation after only a moment&rsquo;s pause rather than the seven day hiatus that had actually occurred. <br /><br />Biting back a comment about Sylar even having a &lsquo;friend&rsquo; as beneath him, Peter shrugs off his coat and edges slowly into the room. He knows that last week was a lone success, if it comes to a battle with Sylar&rsquo;s abilities, Peter is confident in the other&rsquo;s victory.<br /><br />&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Curious and uncertain of the killer&rsquo;s mood.<br /><br />Sylar, gaze on the ceiling, nods. Peter ignores the slight ruffle in the usually pristine hair style and his fingers itchy need to touch.<br /><br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a teenager, but he has a certain way of putting things that I can relate to.&rdquo; The velvet voice is low and even, like he&rsquo;s discussing the whether. Peter quietly puts his satchel and keys on the counter.<br /><br />&ldquo;His advice...and I quote &ldquo;For a god-like superhero you are really fucked up. Does this dude you&rsquo;re so fixated on even know you like him? I mean shit man, you have a strange idea of courting someone, you know. Try and ask him to the movies or something. Jesus.&rdquo;<br /><br />Peter makes a strangled sound that is somewhere between horror and laughter. Not only is it an uncanny impersonation of the average teenager, the words are just&hellip;. <br /><br />Sylar turns his head to look Peter dead in the eye for the first time since the nurse arrived home.<br /><br />&ldquo;Would you please come to the movies with me tonight Peter?&rdquo; The words are fairly innocent, the hot, syrupy suggestion in the velvet voice is anything but.<br /><br />Taking a deep breath, Peter summons his courage and walks over to the couch. Seeing his approach, Sylar sits up, booted feet hit the floor; head tipping back, hands open on his knees. Peter gently trails the back of his fingers down the smooth, handsome face before him from temple to jaw. He watches in stunned comprehension as Gabriel&rsquo;s breath catches, his eyes flutter shut, the long throat issues what can only be described as a moan.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is a really, really bad idea.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice sounds alien to his own ears. Despite his words, his fingers continue to explore, tracing the strong brows and neat nose, long inky lashes and lovely mouth. Gabriel arches like a cat, pushing into Peter&rsquo;s caress, searching for more while his own hands remain still.<br /><br />&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Sylar agrees, eyes closed. &ldquo;Why do you think I force myself to stay away? I get to day six and then I have to come back.&rdquo; A long low sigh. &ldquo;I should just kill you.&rdquo; <br /><br />Peter brings his other hand up to steady himself on one broad shoulder.<br /><br />&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Instant agreement and suddenly Peter feels something within him shift. The battle he&rsquo;s been fighting against this attraction has ended, a white flag of surrender offered. He wants this, wants this man and god help him&hellip;damn the consequences. Because boy, will there be consequences.<br /><br />Leaning down, Peter presses his lips to Gabriel&rsquo;s in a light, chaste kiss.<br /><br />&ldquo;Just to let you know, I don&rsquo;t get naked on a first date.&rdquo; He murmurs against the other&rsquo;s mouth.<br /><br />Lids fly open and midnight orbs look up into his, shock and joy waring with hilarious disappointment.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh yes you do.&rdquo; Strong hands catch Peter at the hips and pull him forward until the slighter man straddles Sylar&rsquo;s lap. Wriggling forward until he can press his hard cock against Sylar&rsquo;s, Peter let&rsquo;s his knees sink deep into the couch cushions on either side of them and takes another nipping kiss.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Peter agrees as he pulls his shirt over his head and drops it onto the floor behind him. &ldquo;I really do.&rdquo; Nimble fingers undo shirt buttons with incredible skill as citrus flavoured telekinesis joyfully unzips pants and unlaces shoes. <br /><br />Sudden pain and Sylar&rsquo;s long fingers grip Peter&rsquo;s hips, nails digging in with iron control. Leaning his forehead against Peter&rsquo;s collar bone, Sylar&rsquo;s voice sounds like someone ground gravel into the velvet.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can&hellip; I need to&hellip;&rdquo; there is both threat and desperate need in the words.<br /><br />Holding still, Peter draws another white flag from within and offers it freely.<br /><br />&ldquo;You can Gabriel, I want you to&hellip;&rdquo; his hands tug non-too gently at the thick hair. &ldquo;Anything you want, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;<br /><br />With permission sought and granted, Sylar finally takes the lead.<br /><br />They kiss like they've been lovers for a decade or more. Straight past the fumbling of a first time and well into 'I know what you like' territory. The press of Gabriel&rsquo;s lips and the hot, push of his tongue finds Peter sighing, opening his mouth and letting Gabriel in. The sudden sweetness of it makes his heart ache. Inching even impossibly closer, Peter tries to occupy the same place in time and space as Gabriel, his body reacting to the instinct of passion and politely taking his mind along for the ride. Kissing the hot, sensual mouth back with the hunger he'd so easily surrendered, their tongues fight not for domination but to determine who could explore the other's mouth more hungrily. <br /><br />Kisses that send shivers up Peter spine, greedy wicked hands that seem intent on touching every inch of his skin and bringing him to aching arousal. The shivers stop completely when Gabriel&rsquo;s power tears their clothes into confetti and a long, nimble tongue laps at small beads of sweat collecting at the base of Peter&rsquo;s throat. <br /><br />Surrendering control, Peter offers only a passionate &lsquo;yessss, yesss&rsquo; as he is manhandled over onto the couch with his forearms braced on the side. Spreading his legs in blatant invitation, Peter arches his spine into the touch of Gabriel&rsquo;s mouth at his tailbone, a full-body shiver giving away any pretence he might have had of self-control. Head dipping in pleasure as Gabriel reaches beneath him to encircle his cock, palming the shaft and rubbing intently at the swollen head.<br /><br />Peter&rsquo;s brain thinks of trying to return the caress, but his flesh is another matter, it replies to Gabriel's hands and skin with a full body shudder and a needy thrust of his hips into that stroking touch. It occurs to him that this is really happening. He is actually here on his couch about to have what he is sure will be really amazing sex with Gabriel Grey. Mentally pleading that he isn't about to wake up sticky and broken-hearted, Peter&rsquo;s lips curl into a lazy, sex-infused smile. <br /><br />Then an intimate caress of both power and fingers and Peter relaxes into the sensation as Gabriel opens his body, stretching and twisting until he is panting with need. <br /><br />&quot;-Yes-&quot; Peter's eyes almost close as Gabriel's fingers breach his body, the slippery silk of the touch sending his head forward once again to rest drunkenly on the cloth beneath him. A shift and play of long lean muscles behind him and Peter takes a long, deep breath.<br /><br />The touch, the sensation of hard, swollen flash against his needy opening is too much of a temptation. Hands going white knuckled on the fabric beneath them, Peter nearly begs. Oh, he wants this. Wants Gabriel inside him so badly it feels like he is going to scream if he isn't taken, and taken fast. <br /><br />Sylar responds to the desperation coming from Peter&rsquo;s skin and with a hard, guttural sound pushes his long shaft deep into Peter in one controlled thrust. For a single teardrop moment, they hold still, both awash with the all-encompassing feeling of being possessed and possession. <br /><br />Then Gabriel begins to move.<br /><br />After that, for Peter everything begins to boil down to fleeting snatches of sensation. The pad of his Gabriel's thumb running over his left hipbone, the hot wisp of air behind the delicate shell of his ear raising goose bumps on his forearms, the hard, lean body rocking relentlessly into his. As Gabriel thrusts into him, over and over, Peter's body is pulled back and forth against his braced arms, knees bending so that he can push back and take even more, feel all of it, down to his soul. <br /><br />And he keeps talking. Deadly, heart-breaking words that fuck Peter&rsquo;s brain as his cock owns Peter&rsquo;s body.<br /><br />&ldquo;Perfect&hellip;yes&hellip;only you&hellip;in my head all the time&hellip;beautiful&hellip;mine&hellip;Peter&hellip;only one&hellip;only you&hellip;love...&rdquo;<br /><br />The clench of desperate hands across the top of his thighs and Peter knows he is close. Gabriel is giving him everything in him, his passion, his voice and his magnificent cock bringing Peter up a high, blissful mountain. Tearing his hand from its ferocious grip on the couch, Peter strokes himself in time with his partner's thrusts, occasionally rasping the back of his fingers on the woven cloth. The small pain only serves to contrast with the brilliance taking place behind him. <br /><br />The apartment is gone, the world gone; all that is left is Gabriel and the mountain disappearing out from under Peter.<br /><br />A warm, pleasured scream curls up through Peter's lungs and is ready to burst from his lips. He is peripherally aware of the couch pounding over and over into the floor, but is too lost in the intense wash of electricity flooding through him to try and stifle his shout of ecstasy. Strong fingers now in his hair, mirrors to the pulsing heat invading and spiraling his body, pull his face around and Peter&rsquo;s lips are smothered by the hot, sweet press of his lover's mouth. Gabriel is kissing him, fucking him, loving him. All around Peter, their bodies locked intimately together while he crests the barreling waves of climax sweeping through him. Intense. Mind-blowing. <br /><br />For a fraction of an instant all is blinding white. <br /><br />*****<br /><br />Saturday morning.<br /><br />Peter wakes with his head pillowed on a strongly muscled thigh and long fingers playing gently in his hair. <br /><br />Blinking sleepily he watches as Gabriel changes the station of the television using telekinesis.<br /><br />&ldquo;Why would I want to cook something that looks like vomit? Stupid woman.&rdquo;<br /><br />The cooking show disappears.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s being faithful to you Jodie because that&rsquo;s your sister backstage looking nervous&rdquo;<br /><br />The talk show stays on for nearly thirty seconds before being axed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Children wouldn&rsquo;t understand this anymore than I do.&rdquo;<br /><br />The commentary is witty, vicious and brutally funny. The fingers that stroke his body are loving.<br /><br />Smiling, Peter curls in closer and enjoys a sleep-in.<br /><br /><br /><b>-END-</b></lj-cut>"

Long, gritty brown fingers of wind flow down nearby rock hills, tearing into the unprotected travelers, biting exposed skin of cheek and forehead. They try to run, but with the storm surrounding them till it blocks the horizon, there is no-where to go. Many hunker down, long desert robes pulled tight around children to keep out the scarring sand, others lie prostrate, only a pocket of air created by the forearm to provide life for many long minutes.</b></p><p><b>It is those less familiar with sand traveling, those with more ego than wisdom who are claimed by the storm. Running into the bitter cloud of razor cuts ends swiftly in confusion and bloodied wounds. If the face isn&rsquo;t protected, choking death soon follows. </b></p><p><b>By the time the air clears, dusk is seeping purple haze onto the land and near half the caravan is lost. Some infants without air to breath, many elderly too slow under protective wraps and the foolish, un-recovered beneath new unblemished dunes.&nbsp;Unable to travel further while injuries are tended, the caravan makes a marginal camp. Simple meal of grain paste and dry fruit then the songs begin.</b></p><p><b>Mostly female, occasional male, voices rise into the suddenly peaceful night calling for benevolence from the unseen.</b></p><p><b>*****</b></p><p><b>Less than a league away, atop the rocky hill, a being greater than man watches the destruction below. Unbothered by the vicious dust storm, indeed he had reveled in it, Setekh now stands, powerful arms crossed over his chest and listens to the mourning cries of a dozen voices. If his unusual visage could smile, there might be a smirk across the equine-like features.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;You are cruel.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>Set doesn&rsquo;t turn from his view of the devastated caravan, even though the words are addressed to him. Her lilting voice, hushed in the evening air holds pure contempt, tinged with sadness.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>He knows full well the sadness is not for him.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; His agreement prompts a small sigh of frustration from the woman, his long ears flicker slightly as she walks across the sand to linger at his side. From the corner of his eyes Set absorbs the sight of her. Rich midnight hair that only the most priceless of Pharaoh&rsquo;s wigs could hope to imitate, coal dark eyes in an aristocratic, lovely face. Lapis trimmed gossamer gown barely clothing long limbs of deep, golden skin and brilliant blue-green feather wings, falling like water from her shoulder blades.</b></p><p><b>She had come to this rocky hill not for conversation with him, but because the songs below are for her. For Nephthys. They call to their lady of compassion, the guardian of death that she might prepare their fallen loved ones for the underworld. And because she is Nephthys, sister of Isis and protector of the dead, she answered their call.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;So many lost,&rdquo; the censure in her voice digs at him, but Set does not flinch. &ldquo;You brought down that storm for your own pleasure.&nbsp;For no other gain than to watch them panic and flee. You are cruel my Husband.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>He snorts through the elongated snout his form displays and lifts a marble pale finger towards the north. With preternatural sight no human can match, she follows the gesture and spies the dim oil-fueled lights of an oasis campsite.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;For nine hours the signs were clear,&rdquo; he doesn&rsquo;t raise his voice beyond a murmur, she could read his thoughts if he allowed her, but they agreed many centuries ago to permit each other that privacy. For their sanity if nothing else. The curling lilt in her words non-existent in his unusual voice, its exotic cadence both disconcerting and attractive in its strangeness. &ldquo;Many hundreds read the warning and stayed by the oasis. They,&rdquo; the pale hand forms a dismissive flare of fingers at the battered encampment below, &ldquo;thought they could outrun a desert and arrive at the market a day earlier than their rivals. They dared me Sister-Wife, so I called their dare and thus&hellip;they loose.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>Lips tightening, Nephthys acknowledges his point with a grudging nod, satin hair slipping forwards over her shoulder. Once he would have ventured to comb it back with his fingers. But not for many years.</b></p><p><b>She steps closer to the rocky edge of the mound on which they stand and raises her arms and wings to the balmy night air. Set feels the currents of her power swirl towards the woman before him and cannot quell, has never been able to do so, a rise of admiration at the strength she wields. </b></p><p><b>Often seen as the forgotten sibling to her bright and clever sister Isis and their staunch, noble bother, Nephthys displays her glory not in acts of miraculous benevolence but in unknown compassion and care. Her affection for the people of the desert is unquestioned and the seriousness with which she conducts her duties unparalleled.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>As her power flows into the broken hearts below and guides the spirits of the dead towards the barge of the underworld, the cries of grief ease and the songs of mourning soon soften to an end. He should remain silent in the poignancy of the silence she has created. But he is Set after all and certainly no lord of peace.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Ahh, how they love you my sister.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s snide and petty, but it takes her attention from the suffering on the sand.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;And how they hate you my brother.&rdquo; The verbal shot is obvious, but he takes the jab for the truth that it is.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;But they respect our beautiful desert Nephthys.&rdquo; He strolls closer to her, knowing how his form irritates and sends her calm off balance. &ldquo;They do not take it lightly or try to bend it to their will. They may indeed hate me, the children of this land, but they fear and respect me even more. You will not see another caravan be so dismissive of my warnings for many months to come.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>Once again he is right and how she hates it. The tension in her back a sign of his success in annoying her. </b></p><p><b>Nephthys turns suddenly, wings a swirl of colour in the darkness. Her face hard, voice like the metal from beneath the sand.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t just a statement of respect Set. You have been deliberately harming the people of these tribes for years. We have seen the pattern in the spirits of those in the barge and we notice that you aren&rsquo;t punishing the disrespect of the Dendaren or Nubtanite&hellip;your favorites.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; It is a ridiculous response. Set knows exactly to whom she refers, but he wants her to say it, to confirm finally what his whole divine family knows. Exactly where Nephthys&rsquo; loyalties lie.</b></p><p><b>She turns her face away; the innate honesty in her divine soul still pricks her for her choices. But Nephthys, of all their quartet, is the one to suffer her conscience the most. Irony of their immortal lives that it the soft-hearted youngest who is put to the test so often, between adored, beloved sister and true-bonded husband. </b></p><p><b>&ldquo;You are a cunning creature Husband, none of us can rival you in that power,&rdquo; Nephthys ignores his query to reveal her siblings names, &ldquo;but we are not so touched by Ra&rsquo;s sun as you might hope. Our sister watches every move you make, as does our brother.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a veiled threat, or a warning. Even after centuries of marriage he cannot read her when she chooses to hide her emotions. </b></p><p><b>A threat maybe, but one he easily ignores. Cunning is a rightful title for Set, he will not challenge his bother and sister while they are united on the throne of their realm. Not overtly.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;And you Wife?&rdquo; He toys with his name for her as she does, one moment emphasizing their marriage, another their family bond. &ldquo;Do you watch every move I make?&rdquo; Once again he closes the gap between them, this time lowering his arms to trail fingers across her fine, linen gown. &ldquo;I thought I was barred from your presence some decades ago. Have you changed your mind?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>Her breath hisses in between small white teeth at his actions and the blatant sexuality he allows to flow between them. There is another power his siblings cannot rival him for, although his choices of target are a very select group. But Nephthys of all his conquests has stronger resistance than any other. She holds still at his delicate touch, unresponsive and cold.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>&ldquo;I watch Brother, what you have become,&rdquo; there is some amount of despair in her words and Set stops the gentle movement of his fingers at the tone. Raising her own hand, Nephthy rests the palm on his animal countenance, cheekbone strange and inhuman under her hand. &ldquo;These creatures are not understood and feared, yet you have taken them into your very body. You know what it means to us that your power is used so ruthlessly on the desert people. Deliberate in your cruelty, you plot and plan all the time now Husband. What have you become, what do I look upon?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>Tossing his equine head back from her sweet touch, he reaches into the core of his power and lets his form become fluid, to flow into the crocodile, the hippopotamus, the mule and the scorpion, before becoming human once again. This time with the face he was born with, the face of her brother. Marble pale, auburn-red hair brushing his shoulder-blades, tall and strongly built like no desert dweller. </b></p><p><b>It is the face and body of the man she married, of the brother she once clung to, the being she loved before he become something twisted that could achieve his ends&hellip;whatever they were.</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Your dshr-haired lover Nephthys? Your foreign born bastard who could never have come from Nut&rsquo;s sacred womb?&rdquo; The sneer on the handsome face is horrible in that he is still beautiful while reeking of contempt and hate. &ldquo;Would you prefer to look on this?&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>He gives her no time to answer, tangling strong fingers in her midnight hair and pulling her face to his for a bruising, powerful melding of lips. Nephthys doesn&rsquo;t fight him, instead curling close, hands brushing the night-cool skin of his bared torso, catching on the warm gold of his jewelry. His anger cools somewhat by her free-given passion, the kiss ends gently, bodies close, human faces now inches apart.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>&ldquo;I miss my brother, my husband Setehk.&rdquo; Her words are mere puffs of breath on his lips. &ldquo;Yes, I want my family united again. I want you to join us at Heliopolis, to stand at our brother&rsquo;s side and to welcome you into my bed.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>For a moment she thinks he might agree, might repair the damage and ask for forgiveness for his actions.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>But looking into her lover&rsquo;s face, Nephthys forgets exactly whom she is talking to. That Set, Setekh is not only the lord of the desert and master of storms&hellip;he is also chaos and pride incarnate.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Pushed back by his powerful arms, she almost stumbles, her unearthly grace gone in the presence of her husband.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>&ldquo;You mean fawn at our brother&rsquo;s feet? No.&rdquo; The white skinned human face is gone, replaced by that of a myriad animal that has no name, only the magnificent red hair remains. Voice mean and prideful, Set continues, &ldquo;He does not deserve his throne or the crown he wears, I will not pretend otherwise.&rdquo; As she gathers her composure he looks on from behind the mask of his face. &ldquo;But thank you Sister-Wife, now I know where your loyalties lie&hellip;where they always have.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>He turns back to the rocky drop and looks down on the quiet caravan.

Maybe he won&rsquo;t kill them for her after all. </b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t loyalty I was offering Husband.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>The moment is caught by time and frozen. </b></p><p><b>Set does not move.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>He feels her power coil within her and braces slightly in case she means to attack, but then&hellip;nothing. Only the swoop of wings and a grief-filled cry as a falcon, wing tips coloured lapis blue, ascends into the night sky. </b></p><p><b>The sandstorm is gone. It&rsquo;s passion and destruction over until more foolish desert-walkers believe they can defy Setekh of the Red Sands.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Her voice was sweet, a touch of something he had not sampled in many years. But it was an indulgence that could not, ultimately, be allowed. A fair offer, a chance at redemption for one who perhaps did not deserve it and was thus rejected for stronger reasons, for another purpose.</b></p><p><b>A purpose greater than even the Gods of Egypt might understand.</b></p><p><b>A legend to come.</b></p></strong></o:p></span></lj-cut>"

"event","<strong>Title:</strong> It's Always A Car Wreck.<br /><strong>Fandom: </strong>WWE<br /><strong>Rating</strong>: PG 13<br /><strong>Pairing: </strong>Jericho/Triple H<br /><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Titan owns them, I don't.<br /><strong>Summary: </strong>The worst thing about this match has to be the body contact.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""It's Always A Car Wreck.""><p><strong>It's Always&nbsp;A Car Wreck.<br /></strong><br />Fully Loaded 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2000.</p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">This was one of the best and worst matches he&rsquo;d ever worked. First time on pay-per-view wrestling the man lifting a high knee into his apparently cracked ribs and then with a sickening thump his back and hips are planted hard into the canvas. Big warm body pressing into his own, but with all that weight held up on an elbow and knee, he can easily breath and even more easily lift first his hips then his shoulders off the mat. Normally the move would only garner a two count. No way was he going down for a high knee lift, had to be at least a finishing maneuver&hellip;or in this case at least three finishing maneuvers, because this match wasn&rsquo;t going to be decided by a one-two-three. Instead, the counting was going to continue to ten.</span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&lsquo;Only the second Last Man Standing match in WWF history.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Unless Jericho or the Game got to their feet first.</span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&lsquo;Jericho&rsquo;s springboard dropkick taking the Game outside the ring.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">The worst thing about this match has to be the body contact. Stupid thing to bitch about when his entire career is based on getting a hell of a lot of contact with other men&rsquo;s bodies, but of course when it came to this man and this much contact, his expression becomes wry as he idly contemplates another occupation. Professional worker he might be, but he was only human and every time they collided with something less than extreme violence, he forgot his own name.</span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&lsquo;Triple H has got Jericho&rsquo;s body opened up there in an Abdominal Stretch.&rsquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Body contact like <i>this</i> was the problem, stealing his focus from his work, taking his mind off the next twenty minutes and replaying seconds of touch over and over in his head. His body honed to respond to the prompts, to create his own and perform physical feats that seem so commonplace now but once would have dragged impressed gasps from the nearby horde. </span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&lsquo;This kid&rsquo;s not gonna die as he scores with a Spinning Heel Kick.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">A woman&rsquo;s piercing shriek rips across the ring. Identification unnecessary as no-one who knows her could forget that voice. Moments later, after a series of moves and counters that are almost painful in their intimacy, he comes to rest across the crowd barrier, head wrenched back by his enemy&rsquo;s fingers, backside presented to the man &nbsp;in a such a fashion to cause a snort of irony to issue from his throat. But it isn&rsquo;t the man the attention is on now. Instead, as delicate fingers turn his check from pale gold to brilliant red, the woman begins her strut, the crowd roars its hatred and he has a moment to regain control.</span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&lsquo;Okay, ya made yer point there Mrs. Helmsley.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Irish whip, elbow, ropes, sleeper with body scissors.&rdquo; Strands of dark, blond hair catch in his eyelashes, strong jaw encased in hot skin and close trimmed beard press against his closed eyelid. He nods imperceptibly. &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; Fingers tugging in his hair, forcing him to his feet, then hands lock around forearms and air whistles past his skin as he is hurled, cannon-like into the corner of the ring. Then the worst of the match rears its head again as massive arms wrap around his neck and skull, sweat-slick skin slides against his back.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Sheer torture, to have this man hold him in such an embrace. To have it indicate hate instead of something else. Falling to the mat, caught tight, cradled so there is no harm to him. Legs lift behind his hips, powerful thighs surrounding him, controlling him, presenting the world with a furious hateful passion.</span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Body Scissors from the Game, around the injured ribs of Jericho, along with the sleeper.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Warm breath murmurs, lips tickling the fine shell of his ear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty quiet tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">God. Casual conversation while wrapped together like lovers, but the concern in his enemy&rsquo;s voice is blatant and understandable. Normally a raucous and verbal performer, happy to improvise and discuss the match in the secret code of the ring, he&rsquo;s barely spoken to the man in the last ten minutes, most of the plan doesn&rsquo;t require it and his subdued behavior is more obvious than he&rsquo;s thought. He&rsquo;s clinging to the edges of his control right now, forcing his body to do as instructed, to play his part and celebrate his craft, while fighting the urge to press his hips back into the hot flesh he can feel at his lower back. </span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;S&rsquo;nothing.&rdquo; He replies through clenched teeth, heavy forearm under his chin. &ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; tired. It&rsquo;s all good.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">For a moment the arms tighten, almost a hug. He freezes, body once pliant now on a thousand edges of tension. Then the limbs are gone, a broad palm in his back pushes him away and he sprawls like a broken doll in the centre of the ring.</span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Stay down kid. Just stay down, it ain&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">This time, the long count works. Face to the mat, mantra of control repeated over and over. He needs a diversion and sudden inspiration comes. A ribald comment from back-stage springs to mind, the coarse humour bringing a smile to his lips and some element of relaxation to his frayed nerves. For the next ten minutes, he manages to cope by telling himself dirty jokes.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">It lasts near to the end of the bout. Lip swollen from the woman&rsquo;s blow, hair a mess from rough fingers, he pulls himself to his feet and makes a beautiful show of nearly falling.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Fine from here.&rdquo; The black and white mutters low under his breath, orders received and passed on. </span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Timing now is everything. They have been cut loose, allowed to wrap things up as they see fit, only the finale set in stone. His enemy has scarlet across his face, a macabre mask that&rsquo;s contradicted by the furious excitement in the whiskey coloured eyes.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Another clash, more performed pain for everyone to enjoy. </span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Triple H has reached the ropes but Jericho doesn&rsquo;t have to break the walls.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Less body contact now. Higher impact, greater thrills. He can do this, there isn&rsquo;t much more time to fill. Balance now. Standing on the high table, arms locked together for safety as much as position.</span></p><p><i><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Oh no. God in Heaven, this is like a car wreck.&rdquo;</span></i></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">He can hear the man in the hat, he stands not far away. It is always like a car wreck&hellip;without any cars of course.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Looking through crazy strands, he watches the other man from three feet away. Timing has had its tribute and he does not need to move again, only to watch through lidded eyes and listen to the numbers. To gaze at his opponent, his enemy and maybe, for at least a little while, indulge what can never be.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">******</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">The striped shirt is dry and cool against his shoulder, arm around his waist an unrequired assist, but his agony must be seen, his vulnerability displayed and applauded. Or is it his strength?</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Hey CJ. Match looked great.&rdquo; New voice and he opens his eyes to be surrounded by black. Curtains, t-shirts and clipboards. &ldquo;You guys worked that like a bitch, can&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s your first Pay together.&rdquo; Straightening he offers his thanks to his human crutch and rakes a hand through his hair to pull it away from the perspiration on his forehead. The stage-manager stands back to let him pass, a small corridor amongst the talent and crew waiting backstage. He has no ego about where the opening came from; it had already been made for the man who preceded him from the ring.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Impact. But nothing like before. This time the hands mean not to bruise but to clutch, pretty, sparkling eyes filled with excitement rather than loathing. Her sequin top catches on his skin.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Fantastic Chris. Best. Match. Ever. Hunter practically tore off the door to the dressing room he&rsquo;s so pumped.&rdquo; Octaves reaching violin range, he hugs her again, she is used to the sweat and blood.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; He leans back from her to gauge the truth in lovely brown eyes. &ldquo;Good. Thinking we nailed it and hearing we nailed it are two different things Steph.&rdquo; The talking pulls at his lip, bringing a slight wince as the torn flesh protested the punishment. </span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">The excited eyes turned quickly upset. &ldquo;Damn Chris. I&rsquo;m never doing that again...&rdquo; He shakes his head to cut her off but she barrels over his interruption. &ldquo;&hellip;no seriously. You all tell me to just hit you boys and I know it&rsquo;s nothing compared to other stuff, but I hate it. I can slap you without breaking the skin at least&hellip;one of the girls will show me how.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Mutinous, defiant, she kisses him hard on his bruised mouth and pulls free. Ridiculously high heels snapping as she heads towards the other side of back-stage. Rolling his eyes, he probes one finger at his newly-smarting wound and rewinds his way back to the dressing rooms. Various congratulations and back-slaps adorn his parade, moments of acknowledgement that he keeps close, words bolstering not inconsiderable confidence. &lsquo;Yes, you can do this thing. You are very, very good at it.&rsquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Destination in site, locker and shower. Then a hand around his arm, frisson of pleasure at the touch, identification completed by body before even razor sharp brain can catch up. Silent tug into room empty save for the two of them. His own form responding to the tactic like it had in the ring; he feels the press of hard plaster against his back and is intimately conscious of the small distance between his skin and that of his enemy.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Arms crossed over his chest, Hunter begins a slow perusal, starting at wild hair, ending with black lacing. It makes him want to gasp, to run, to do anything but stand still and endue that gaze, to come up with something, anything to stop those eyes and his body&rsquo;s primal response.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;I think we hit&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;So did you really hate it as much as you seemed to or am I just completely paranoid around you these days?&rdquo; The interruption does more than stop his words; they completely derail his thought process.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;What? No, it was fine&hellip;I just&hellip;&rdquo; Paranoid? The man who exudes such confidence that people feel better about themselves just knowing he&rsquo;s in the same room, is paranoid? Around him?</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">But he was cut off again, big arms unfolding, one of Hunter&rsquo;s hands resting palm flat against the wall by his face.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Because I thought that was one of the nastiest matches I&rsquo;ve ever pulled off. We got the moves in amongst all the brutal shit and you, you mouthy, smart-assed little brat,&rdquo; Hunt moves closer, stealing away the desperate inches, nearly naked body close enough to caress, mouth just moments from his own. &ldquo;...you barely&hellip;said&hellip;a&hellip;word.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">And he couldn&rsquo;t now. There wasn&rsquo;t the slightest puff of air in his lungs; it had all been stolen away by his reactions to Hunter. He clenches his hands into fists and presses the knuckles back into the wall, to stop them from exploring the territory so perfectly presented. Lowering his face, he closes his eyes, licking his lips to encourage some words to come&hellip;anything so he wasn&rsquo;t rendered silent by this man.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Him, rendered silent? No wonder Hunter thought something was wrong.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;Said I was tired Hunt. Nothing&rsquo;s wrong&hellip;big match environment&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Once again cut off before the sentences could get any more foolish.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;That better be a lie Christopher, because you&rsquo;ve got one chance to tell me what I did to make you like that or I&rsquo;m gonna do something else that&rsquo;ll probably get me sued.&rdquo; The words were harsh now, an indication of anger or frustration he couldn&rsquo;t tell. But they still made no sense, each component translated but the meaning of the sentence a mystery.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">That did it. The idea that he would ask for Hunter&rsquo;s money for anything, shot a spear of inappropriate amusement through him, curling his lips and raising his gaze to the concerned?...concerned one just above his own. A laugh smothered by his hand, the wall no longer in danger from his tense fingers, he shakes his head, bright blue eyes lighting at the thought of court-rooms and lawyers.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;What? What?&rdquo; Expression perplexed, but at least no longer concerned, Hunter moved impossible closer. &ldquo;Fucking hell, Jericho you&rsquo;re unpredictable! What in&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Hands rising up to equally chaotic hair, he rolls his eyes at his own cluelessness and this time interrupts the other man&rsquo;s words, his lips pressing quickly against Hunt&rsquo;s astonished ones, a snatched flick of tongue along his rival&rsquo;s. Lowering back down off his toes, he grins into an expression he was certain no-one else had ever witnessed.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">&ldquo;<i>That</i> is what I had an issue about Hunt.&rdquo; Letting go completely, he leans back against the wall and crosses arms over chest in a perfect reversal of their previous postures. &ldquo;Now did someone say something about being sued?&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">Because there was still the smallest, infinitesimal chance that he was wrong.</span></p><p><span style=""color: windowtext"">As a deep-throated snarl echoes in the room, lips and tongue mauled by a ferocious kiss, his head bumped gently back into the wall, body lifted high and hard in a ring-like move, Jericho resolved that no&hellip;he wasn&rsquo;t even close to being wrong.</span></p></lj-cut>"

She who is responsible for this 'cos she mentioned Tomko's hotness level.</tt></p><lj-cut text=""Nougat or Honeycomb?""><p><b>Nougat or Honeycomb?</b></p><p>Chris Jericho was feeling remarkably relaxed as he wandered back to his dressing room. Remarkable because Chris wasn&rsquo;t exactly what you would call an easy-going guy. Maybe it was fate, good vibes from the crowd or just that he seemed to have, against all expectations found happiness, maybe he was just in a good mood. Nevertheless, tonight he felt relaxed. Which was a shame because he only had a moment to brace himself as Christian barreled intently down the hallway towards him.</p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Man Chris I gotta tell you something!&rdquo; Chris&rsquo; friend Christian, tall, slim and incredibly gregarious. A man whom despite Chris best efforts, actually seemed to genuinely like him. </span></p><p>&nbsp;Go figure.</p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a measure of Jericho&rsquo;s fondness for the other Canadian that he allowed Christian to physically push him into his dressing room. Like someone from a lame spy thriller Christian checked the hallway before turning to the other occupant of the room. With a big sigh, he sank onto Chris&rsquo; couch and stared morosely at the floor.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in big trouble Chris.&rdquo; The slimmer man confessed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;Leaning back against a bench beneath the mirror, Jericho examined his friend. Jay&rsquo;s perennial good mood seemed genuinely gone today. No bright grin, corny joke or wild hyperactivity. Chris felt a flicker of worry.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> &ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; Chris prompted.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I ran into Adam at lunch and&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo; Christian bit his lower lip.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris waited expectantly.</p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;we had COFFEE!&rdquo; the slim man blurted out at last.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;God Jay! I thought you were going to say you were pregnant!&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian leapt up. &ldquo;Chris come on!&rdquo; There was an edge of real distress in the man&rsquo;s voice, causing Chris to crush his amusement. Moving to the just vacated couch he sat and said, &ldquo;Okay. Sorry, so what&rsquo;s so bad about getting coffee together?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay began to pace. &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s Adam and we used to be...you know&hellip;?&rdquo; Turning pale blue eyes on his friend. &ldquo;You did know, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris controlled his expression with determined willpower.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes Jay. I don&rsquo;t think many people exist who didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He informed him.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yeah...well...&rdquo; rubbing a hand through his short hair, Christian resumed his pacing. &ldquo;We kinda ended a while back. It was mutual and all cool and everything. Then he got hurt and I got hurt and we didn&rsquo;t see each other and now he&rsquo;s back and we had coffee.&rdquo; As if that explained everything, Christian dropped to the couch next to Chris.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So the coffee means your back together?&rdquo; he hazarded a guess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; another sigh. &ldquo;Just that it...you know&hellip;kinda rekindled the fires I guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris studied his friend curiously. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a bad thing&hellip;?&rdquo; Letting his question linger in the air.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third sigh, this time bigger than the others.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I&hellip;well&hellip;..I kinda like someone else.&rdquo; He finished in a rush.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This apparently wasn&rsquo;t news to Jericho either.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And&hellip;.?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not like he knows I like him or anything. I haven&rsquo;t like, asked him out and the thing is if I start seeing Adam again then I may miss out on things with&hellip;.err...this other person. If he even likes me, which he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Jay turned to look beseechingly into Chris&rsquo; bright sapphire eyes.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Help?&rdquo; He begged.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh brilliant! Chris cursed internally. Chris fuckin&rsquo; Jericho, master of nearly destroying his own life, giving advice to the love lorn. Jesus, the guy should have asked Randy or one of the girls. Chris turned his reputedly sharp intellect to targeting the most obvious problem.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who do you want?&rdquo; It seamed a reasonable question.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Christian wailed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not so reasonable. Okay.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have to decide what you want more. Nougat or honeycomb.&rdquo; Chris pointed out.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay&rsquo;s look of incomprehension was almost comic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Both are desirable,&rdquo; Jericho explained. &ldquo;But if you had to choose just one for the rest of your life. The only dessert you would ever have, which would you choose?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian though for a second. &ldquo;Can I taste each one?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not what I want to think about Jay!!&rdquo; Chris complained getting to his feet. &ldquo;But yeah, you know how one tastes and you like it. But you haven&rsquo;t even tried the other, so how can you know if you like it?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay nodded his head eagerly. &ldquo;Or if it likes me?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris smiled. The weird road of food being a metaphor for lovers had been, admittedly, his fault, but for his own sanity he better divert Jay.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a match in twenty.&rdquo; He reminded the seated man.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That seemed to bring Jay back to the present.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yeah. Thanks Chris. Man you are the best friend I ever had you know.&rdquo; Jumping up Christian threw his arms around the smaller man in a big hug. Chris tensed instinctively but quashed the reaction quickly and gently disentangled himself from Jay&rsquo;s embrace.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian banged out of his door the way he did everything, with lots of energy and very little dexterity. </span></p><p>&nbsp;Jericho listened to the sound of what he thought was Jay skipping&hellip;<i>skipping?...</i>down the hall. Shaking his head Chris&rsquo; lips quirked into a soft smile. No matter what, Jay was his friend.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;The blond though himself a fortunate man.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;********</p><p>&nbsp;Jay loitered just inside the men&rsquo;s locker room, feeling a little like some kind of pervert, waiting for his friend, FRIEND, Tyson to emerge. It was late and the arena almost empty. It was a run-through, tonight and he and Tyson were last with Shawn and Chris. The two blondes leaving earlier, Tyson having to remain to do some work with the trainer on a sore shoulder. The last ones in the locker room, Christian fiddled with his gym bag strap and tried not to imagine his friend, F.R.I.E.N.D. naked&hellip;in the shower.</p><p>&nbsp;It had begun when they&rsquo;d been introduced. The huge man, Tyson, intimidating and mean looking. A great heel look from the get go. Not a master of the ring in any imagination, but ready to lean and to work, which is more than can be said for some out the back. Jay had literally had his breath stolen when he&rsquo;d shaken the man&rsquo;s hand, unable to stop his eyes caressing the broad, muscled shoulders and awesome tribal tattoos on his bare arms. Instantly curious to know if they were all over the big man&rsquo;s body.</p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Call me Ty,&rdquo; A deep gravelly voice and definite twinkle of humour in the dark chocolate eyes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Err&hellip;Jay...just Jay. Like the letter,&rdquo; Christian had stammered like a teenage girl. <i>Fuckhead! </i>He cursed himself<i>. Talk like a grown up for Christ&rsquo;s sake!</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: normal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Jay, like the letter.&rdquo; Ty had repeated. Tasting the name on his tongue as if it was a fine wine or something. &ldquo;Pleased to be working with you Jay.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: normal"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian had fallen, then and there. Hook, basket and eggs. </span></p><p>&nbsp;For the next few months working the programme with Chris and Trish had been fantastic and awful at the same time. Fantastic because it was Chris and working with him was always ace. Trish was a bud and Tyson, well; having a big mean bodyguard...sorry&hellip;Problem Solver&hellip;was a cool arc. And having the sexy 6&rsquo;6&rsquo; devil bearded, tattooed, black wife beater wearing Tyson Tomko as said bodyguard was the icing on the cake.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;But it was awful for Jay&rsquo;s nerves and hormones. Every day Christian talked himself into asking the big man out. &ldquo;Wanna get a coffee? A drink? Dinner? Can I blow you?&rdquo; AAARGH. The problem was every time he worked up the courage to approach the man, after a show, during a break in rehearsal, Tyson&rsquo;s nearness would completely throw him off his stride. He&rsquo;d get tongue tied and blushy, reverting to talking about work as a cover.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">He suspected, <i>hoped really, </i>that maybe, just maybe Ty had liked him back. Only talking when needed and revealing a dry, sardonic sense of humour when he did, Ty was the definition of the strong silent type. His silences seemed to balance Jay&rsquo;s endless prattle about life, the universe and everything.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Sometimes he&rsquo;d catch the big man watching him, the chocolate orbs warm and amused. It could be &lsquo;interest&rsquo;. It could also be &lsquo;brotherly affection&rsquo;.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;And now Adam was back.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;His Adam.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;EdgeandChristian.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;AdamandJay.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s practically fucking sacred around here.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Seemed pretty sacred back then too.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Then coffee the other day. Looking at Adam, all gorgeous and healthy again. Long hair tied back so neat, he&rsquo;d chucked a fit at seeing Jay&rsquo;s shorn locks, all long limbs and wicked smile. His Adam.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;They&rsquo;d even shared a look. One of Those Looks &trade;&nbsp;that Meant Something &trade;. It had sent him running to Chris, his head spinning, trying to figure out what to do. His best buddy Chris, who had such a great life now all that shit with Goldberg was over, had set him straight. Jay knew Chris was a hell of a lot smarter than he was and was in a real, actual relationship. Something that Jay hadn&rsquo;t had since Adam. Jay had needed Chris and the blonde was there to help him, now all he had to do was work up the guts to ask Tyson out so he could &lsquo;sample the dessert&rsquo; as Chris put it.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Jay was shaken out of his soon-to-be pornographic thoughts by a sudden pop and fizzle above his head. The bare light bulb blew out, followed by the other three in the locker room, ending with a loud BZZZZZT from the switch by the door. Then the room was plunged into darkness.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;The shower stopped.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;A luminescent glow from the upper windows lent enough light to see, so Jay began to make his careful way to the door.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ty? Something&rsquo;s blown out the power.&rdquo; He called reaching out to flick the light switch back on.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;A strong hand grabbed his wrist violently an inch from the switch.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yarghh!&rdquo; Jay yelped in fear and surprise.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Gasping for the breath that had left his lungs in shock he stared up at the man holding his slender wrist in a vice like grip. &ldquo;Ty? You scared the fucking shit outta me!&rdquo; he accused, then paused taking in the sight of the other man.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Tyson was naked underneath a dark blue towel slung hastily around his hips, of that Jay was certain. Droplets of water still danced from the strong muscled shoulders down a firm chest, towards the towel. Unable to help himself Jay&rsquo;s eyes fastened to a droplet, flooded with an inexplicable jealously for the small amount of H2O. Pain emanating from his clasped wrist dragged Christian&rsquo;s eyes back to Ty&rsquo;s face. Brown eyes were locked onto his hand; fear the dominant emotion present, quickly being drowned by anger. Turning to the soft blue gaze of his captive, Ty shut his eyes, inhaling deeply, filling the large torso and threatening the loosely tied towel. Christian watched, heart beating like a hummingbird, as the big man once more looked at him.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ty?&rdquo; He managed, mind awhirl from the big man&rsquo;s closeness.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Gently, almost reverently, Tyson lifted Christian&rsquo;s still imprisoned hand towards his mouth. All though fled from the Canadian&rsquo;s brain as the softest of kisses was placed into his palm.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;don&rsquo;t ever...&rdquo; Tyson&rsquo;s words a desperate whisper.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Almost choking with a mixture of pleasure and surprise, the blond moaned as Tyson slowly rubbed the back of Jay&rsquo;s hand against his cheek.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;God Ty&hellip;would you&hellip;&rdquo; Jay tried to form a sentence, to beg the big man to continue with his caress.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;With incredible care, Tomko released the slender wrist and slid his hands around Jay&rsquo;s waist, pulling the smaller man into a tight embrace. Snuggling against the defined chest, Jay began to plant small kisses onto smooth tanned skin. Loosening his arms slightly, Tyson looked down at the man in his arms, resting his forehead against Jay&rsquo;s. His words were low.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Christian held his breath.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;have you?&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Ty felt the long lean body in his arms tense, as if readying for battle.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;He staggered slightly as Jay literally leapt into his arms, long legs entwining around his waist. As Tyson&rsquo;s towel lost it&rsquo;s heroic battle with gravity, Christian revealed his answer.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck yeah!&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;******</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Ty secured his hands under Jay&rsquo;s butt as the blonde wriggled in his embrace. His mouth sought and received contact with the warm pink lips finally at the same level as his own. A deep delicious kiss ensued, tongues duelling in erotic combat. Breaking the lip lock after several long minutes, Tomko dragged his eyes off the flushed beauty in his arms and assessed the surrounding area.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck me Ty.&rdquo; Christian ordered, locking his arms around Tomko&rsquo;s muscled neck.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Seeming without effort Ty carried Jay across the locker room, one long arm releasing its embrace momentarily to swipe a large pile of blue towels onto the floor.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Laying his writhing partner onto the soft cloth, Ty lowered his naked body onto Jay&rsquo;s. Long legs once again wrapped around his hips as the blonde undulated upwards, trying to gain friction.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes! Do me on the floor. Baby please fuck me. I want you soo bad.&rdquo; Jay continued to breathe a litany of encouragement and sex talk into his ear, causing Ty&rsquo;s control to be sorely tested.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Willing to obey Jay&rsquo;s demands, Tyson had just gotten one shoe off when the blonde sat up suddenly. One hand at the back of his neck pulling him down into a deep kiss, the other wrapping itself around his burning erection. Groaning the big man gently leaned Jay back into the nest of blue, his fingers going to the oh-so-tempting leather laces at the front of the tight jeans. Tearing his mouth away from Ty&rsquo;s, Jay struggled to help with the task.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. I wanna be naked. I want you to fuck me Baby!&rdquo; Jay implored.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Arching his back in a move more often seen in the ring, Christian pulled his shirt over his head, flinging it away into darkness across the room. Reversing the arch the blond raised his hips, shimmying out of the now-unlaced pants.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Now Baby. Now!&rdquo; Impatiently.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Slowly and with great attention to detail, Tyson kissed the newly revealed pink nipples. Using the tip of his fingernail to lightly scrape the sensitive surface.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I want you in me so much.&rdquo; Christian declared, breath coming in gasps.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;With his control almost slipping, Ty focussed on torturing the cream skinned chest beneath him.&nbsp;Jay twisted grabbing at his gym bag near the benches, hand desperately seeking his massage oil. Trying to ignore, without success Ty&rsquo;s lips and tongue on his stomach and throat. Struggling with the bottle cap, Jay poured the lotion onto his fingers and groped for the cock so temptingly close to his own. Drenching the rock hard shaft in ylang ylang, Christian tugged firmly, trying to convey a definite message.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ty, come on.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rush my Sweet,&rdquo; Tyson gently soothed his frantic lover. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Light blue eyes burning with intensity and long held desire locked onto chocolate orbs.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ty, if you don&rsquo;t fuck me right now, I&rsquo;m gonna go out and jump the first man I see!&rdquo; He challenged.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Tomko lost his barely-there control. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you DARE!&rdquo; he growled possessively. Large hands snagged long pale thighs, yanking Jay towards him, forcing their naked cocks into glorious, burning contact. Victorious, Christian once again palmed the huge rosy erection lifting his hips in blatant, lewd invitation.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Damn you,&rdquo; Ty cursed under his breath as he lined up his cock with the small pink hole Jay was so wantonly offering. &ldquo;I wanted it to be perfect&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Jay arced once more off the floor as Ty&rsquo;s shaft penetrated him. The burning pain from lack of preparation fading into riotous pleasure as his prostate was grazed.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;.dinner&hellip;.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;mmmmnnn&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;cotton sheets&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;ohhhh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Ty gave up trying to make his point. His lover was lost to sensation, blue eyes drugged and lusty. The big man knew he would be lost himself in a moment, his adoration of the beautiful creature in his arms leading him into ecstasy.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Jay hissed again as Tyson slid strong fingers around his weeping shaft. Pulling and tugging on the straining member in time with Ty&rsquo;s trusts.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;God!&rdquo; Panting, the blonde felt the electric burst of orgasm flow into his cock. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Teeth clenched Jay screamed his passion into the air.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;JAY!&rdquo; Ty joined in the vocal celebration, his own climax shooting stars before his eyes, pumping his seed into the delicious body beneath him.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;For several minutes the only sound in the abandoned room was the harsh breathing of two exhausted lungs.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ty?&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Jay?&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;We can get dinner now.&rdquo; Jay allowed drowsily, completely satisfied.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Ty groaned theatrically and smoothly withdraw from the warm, tight heat he&rsquo;s been lost in. Leaning on one elbow Ty&rsquo;s intense stare bore into Christian&rsquo;s face.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Sweetheart?&rdquo; he&rsquo;s asked.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Hmmmm,&rdquo; Jay was reluctant to rise from the sleepy afterglow.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Ty nuzzled his new lover&rsquo;s nose with his own.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve had you, can I keep you?&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;A gentle snore was his reply.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;*******</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Jay was supposed to have more time.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;He&rsquo;d planned it.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour he&rsquo;d woken up on the floor of the locker room, a fully dressed Ty watching him sleep. He&rsquo;s sat up, ignoring the pain in his well-used ass and crawled across the floor to rest his chin on Ty&rsquo;s knee.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d asked.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;The big man had heaved a sigh and then smiled.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing Sweetheart.&rdquo; Indicating the small pile of Jay&rsquo;s folded clothes. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the hotel.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Frowning slightly, Christian complied, mind dopey and helter-skelter. Not an uncommon state for his mind to be in, but nevertheless.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;And they&rsquo;d gone back to their room. Snuggled down in Tyson&rsquo;s arms, ready to allow sleep to overcome him, Jay had made plans. Plans to spend time making Tyson fall in love with him. He&rsquo;d show the big guy such a wild time, they&rsquo;d make Chris and Steve look like an old married couple.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Imagining more public displays of affection, Jay drifted asleep.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;For the second time missing Ty&rsquo;s soft plea.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;But it was only the next day when his plans crumbled to dust.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Arriving at the arena they&rsquo;d strolled into the locker room, grinning secretly at the re-stacked towels and sharing a loaded look. It had been great.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Then Adam saw them.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Surprising for such a large group of men to become so silent all at the same time.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Jay could read Adam like is own hand. The problem was Adam could return the favour. His ex could see the temporary lessening of manic behaviour, the undeniable glow of satisfaction and the really fucking obvious hickey on the side of his neck.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Momentarily speechless Christian stared at Edge, not sure what he was conveying, just&hellip;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;Adam took his eyes off Jay and glared at the big man standing behind him for a several long seconds. Then, with a stifled curse he turned and stomped into the showers.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Adam&hellip;&rdquo; Jay moved after his friend, trying the form the words to stop the pain he&rsquo;s seen in that once-beloved face.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;A strong hand encircled his wrist, tugging him back around.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;For a moment Tyson stared down into Jay&rsquo;s worried eyes. The worry increased as Ty&rsquo;s eyes went from warm brown to flints of stone in less that a moment.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Better go after him.&rdquo; Ty suggested coldly, releasing Jay&rsquo;s hand. He too then turned on his heel and exited the locker room.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ty&hellip;&rdquo; Christian stared numbly at the empty door, then swung his gaze towards the showers. Ignoring the stares of the other wrestlers, Jay lifted his head proudly and walked slowly out the third exit, towards the star dressing rooms.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;After he&rsquo;d cleared the doorway, he broke into a dead run.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&nbsp;******</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt""><span>&ldquo;Chris!&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay pounded on the locked door to his friend&rsquo;s dressing room.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Chris!&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door swung inwards, revealing a half naked Jericho, hair wet, eyes curious.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I fucked up!&rdquo; Jay admitted.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepping back to invite the other man in, Chris shut and locked the door.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How?&rdquo; Not even asking what Jay was referring to.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay explained in, what was for Chris excruciating, detail. The liason from the night before and his subsequent emotional fuck up five minutes ago.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towelling his hair dry, Jericho advised, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to decide Jay or you might loose them both.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the sigh was the biggest yet.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris asked the same question he&rsquo;d put a week ago.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So&hellip;.which one?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay just stared at the wall, lost in thought.</span></p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">*****</p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time Jay&rsquo;s knock on the hotel room door was polite and even. His fingers stretched nervously at his sides as he waited.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the door opened Jay forced his expression into calm confidence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; He shifted nervously, belying the aura of cool. &ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was studied for a long moment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Edge turned back into the room. </span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing now in Adam&rsquo;s room, Jay&rsquo;s carefully prepared speech went out the window.</span></p><p>Instead Jay found himself drowning in another Look &trade; . This time more than just sexual interest was conveyed, this time it was the past that filled Christian&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly like dropping a heavy bag, Adam straightened and smiled into his ex&rsquo;s startled expression.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I get a hug here?&rdquo; He asked, eyes twinkling.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaken from his daze, Jay stepped forward and into Adam&rsquo;s arms. It was familiar and warm. Like hugging your brother&hellip;or your best friend.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;God we were so fucking young weren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Christian mumbled, forehead on Adam&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slow hand stroked across Jay&rsquo;s lower back.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Adam agreed. &ldquo;We were good though?&rdquo; He asked.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay smiled with remembered bliss.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn good.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaning back Edge caught Jay&rsquo;s eyes again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not gonna shut me out now are you?&rdquo; The simple questions worked well to convey strong emotions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never.&rdquo; Jay vowed. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, EdgeandChristian.

Between them other wrestlers unpacked gear, taped wrists and chatted about the night&rsquo;s work. His overall relaxation was undisturbed by the strong arms snaking around his waist from behind, a face nuzzling his neck. But then again, it depended on whom the arms belonged to.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;So &lsquo;Mr General Manger&rsquo;,&rdquo; Austin said, teeth tugging at the collar of Chris&rsquo; burgundy shirt. &ldquo;Wanna fuck?&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Tilting his head slightly to give his lover greater access.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Jericho replied.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">A low growl was his response, the arms tightening, tipping him slightly off balance.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;&hellip;in about ten minutes.&quot;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Sapphire eyes remained on the bundle of stress across the room.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Do ya know how fuckable ya look in this outfit?&rdquo; the bald man asked.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to get an idea.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Austin gently pressed his groin against Chris&rsquo; backside.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Steve..!&rdquo; the protest was almost serious.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">The growl softened somewhat.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Well, ya come in wearing a suit for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; Austin defended himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only human, ya know.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Jericho replied with a small snort.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Stone Cold&rsquo;s teeth grazed the silver band at Chris&rsquo; neck.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Like the collar by the way.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Necklace.&rdquo; Chris corrected.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Yeah right.&rdquo; Austin scoffed. &ldquo;&hellip;.collar&hellip;&rdquo; he murmured.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Whatcha&rsquo; looking at?&rdquo; he said to cover his comment.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Jericho&rsquo;s eyes sharpened as Tyson Tomko entered the locker room from the far door.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;A decision.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Hmmmmm.&rdquo; Austin continued to mark Chris&rsquo; neck with small red bites.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Tomko had stopped in the doorway the moment he&rsquo;d seen Jay, he was on the verge of turning around when the Canadian spotted him. Dashing over to Ty, Christian grabbed at the bigger man&rsquo;s bag and began to tug him over to the lockers, gesturing and speaking extremely quickly from what Chris could tell.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Hunter Hearst Helmsley stopped beside Chris and Steve, catching sight of the other couple.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;What is it with you Canadians and the psycho bald guys?&rdquo; His asked eyeing Stone Cold.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Face calm, Chris locked eyes with Hunter.</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;They have HUGE cocks.&rdquo;</p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">Austin&rsquo;s muffled laughter caused a shudder down Jericho&rsquo;s spine, but he kept his gaze firmly on the other blonde.

Starting at the rounded summit of the shoulder, heading west. The fingertips stopped. A small freckle was examined, the size of a pinhead. It was granted a kiss. The fingers continued. Across the arch of the neck down to the sudden rise of a shoulder blade. A slow smile spread across the blond&rsquo;s handsome face. One neat fingernail slipped underneath the tiny piece of coloured plastic and lifted it onto a fingertip. It shivered there for a moment. Then the blond blew a gentle gust of breath, causing the shiny plastic to spin, uncontrolled and fluttering to the white cotton expanse below. Blue eyes the colour of sapphires looked down at the broad span of muscle and skin beneath them. Another kiss. A slight shudder in response. Fingers resumed their course, turning east towards the corrugated nubs of the backbone. Crossing this low dip the light touch ascended up a smooth, muscled dune. A third brush of soft lips. A second piece of gold plastic sent into the great beyond. Head tilted the blond slowly walked his fingers back up the spine and to the east. This time, the fingertips trailed steadily south before gracefully curving west, once more passing the spine, then tilting slightly north before loosing contact completely with a small flourish. Several more plastic victims were removed.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-US""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-US""><span style=""mso-tab-count: 1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Was that yer initials?&rdquo; <st1:place w:st=""on""><st1:city w:st=""on"">Austin</st1:city></st1:place> asked, face buried in his pillow.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-US""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-US""><span style=""mso-tab-count: 1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Mmm..hmm.&rdquo; Chris acknowledged, now stroking his lover&rsquo;s back in a firm massage.

I see a drop of sweat slide off my forehead onto the floor of the trainer&rsquo;s room. It joins about the billion others I&rsquo;ve left there while my neck&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; seen to.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fuck Francois. Just chop my head off for god&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not feelin&rsquo; the best right now. </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes Austin, I know. It&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo; Smooth french accent just pisses me off even more as his thumbs press little circles into the side of my spine. Right where the pain is worst.</span><br /><span>He always says that. &ldquo;Not you don&rsquo;t fuckin&rsquo; know&hellip;&rdquo; I begin.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Austin? How bad is it Francois?&rdquo; Vince and his entourage&rsquo;s shiny shoes are now in the room. I can only see from their knees down, because I can&rsquo;t raise my head from where it&rsquo;s spasming with my chin on my chest.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<i>It hurts like acid down my spine</i>.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fuckin&rsquo; agony Vince is what it is!&rdquo; Would I be in here if I was fine you idiot?</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bad swelling from the pressure on the disc. I&rsquo;m releasing the nerve pinch, but it is not good Mr. McMahon.&rdquo; Francois continues rubbing ground zero, pushing in hard. </span></p><p><i>It hurts so much.</i></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn. You were supposed to run this feud with Bischoff for another week at least.&rdquo; The big man doesn&rsquo;t like his plans being upset by my fuckin&rsquo; permanent injury! Asshole.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I can fuckin&rsquo; talk Vince and do some quick spots to keep things hot. Don&rsquo;t get ya panties in a twist. It&rsquo;ll heal.&rdquo; My voice is confident, I almost believe it myself.</span></p><p><i>Agony hotter than hell. </i></p><p>Their silence speaks volumes and I wonder at the look on Fran&ccedil;ois&rsquo; face if they&rsquo;re having doubts about a couple of promos and quick spots.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; God, Vince can&rsquo;t bullshit to save himself. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet tomorrow to assess the situation.&rdquo; He pats me on the back and heads out. I feel the gentle pat like Paul&rsquo;s sledgehammer.</span></p><p><i>Stop hurting for just once second.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i></p><p style=""text-indent: 36pt"">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; I watch their shiny shoes leave and know I&rsquo;m screwed. &ldquo;Fran&ccedil;ois, is it gonna be like this..?&rdquo; Suddenly, just like out in the ring when I took a bump near the steps, I feel a twist in my neck like red-hot fire and then the knife is gone.</p><p><i>Gone</i>.&nbsp;<br /><br />I almost sob with relief. About to lift my head, Francois stops me with a gentle hand.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No Austin, keep your head down. You are still swollen around the disk, but the nerve no longer pinch you. Have an ice pack then cool shower. You are Not ok to fly, someone drive you right?&rdquo; The little French guy starts picking up his towels and stuff.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Drive, yeah, ok. Thanks Francois.&rdquo;</span><br /><span><br />His sneakered feet leave the room and now I&rsquo;m alone.</span></p><p><span><i>It still hurts</i>. </span><br /><br />Throbbing now, but it still hurts. I put a hand up to hold the ice pack in place and watch the water drops mingle with my sweat on the floor.</p><p><span><i>It still hurts.</i></span></p><p><span>I hear the door open and see black boots and bright ring tights move into view. I&rsquo;d recognize those legs anywhere. They are in perfect proportion to the rest of his gorgeous body, all of which I&rsquo;ve enjoyed watching on occasion. What he&rsquo;s doing here is anyone&rsquo;s guess. A hand appears, palm up containing two white painkillers. With a slightly shaky hand I take them from him and pop them in my mouth.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />His other hand appears. It&rsquo;s holding a beer. Damn.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna kiss you in a second Jericho.&rdquo; I say around the meds as I take the beer from that long-fingered hand.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; he comes back sarcastically. </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mmm-humm.&rdquo; I mumble through the beer. </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s any comfort. Eric is in a fit, thinking he&rsquo;s screwed for injuring you on the night of your big return.&rdquo; I lift my head a fraction to see hands resting on slim hips and the bottom of a black &lsquo;Jericoholic&rsquo; t-shirt. </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I snort. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t injure me if he was fuckin&rsquo; tryin&rsquo;. I hit a bump wrong and now my damn neck&rsquo;s swollen again, he was prissin about on the other side of the ring!&rdquo; While we&rsquo;ve been talking, I&rsquo;ve been ogling a certain cute, Canadian from the waist down. One of the best parts</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What about Westlemania?&rdquo; The painkillers must be kicking in because I swear that sounded like concern in his voice. </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me and Dwayne again. He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; heel.&rdquo; This is not news to Jericho apparently.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thought so. Dwayne&rsquo;s good enough to keep your neck safe.&rdquo; Definitely concern.</span><br /><br />I keep my eyes at crotch level and grin. &ldquo;We could run it eyes closed, but I won&rsquo;t be doin&rsquo; much after if this keeps playin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you on Raw tomorrow?&rdquo; he asks. </span></p><p><span>You interested? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Was. Probably not now, this&rsquo;ll have to rest.&rdquo; I grumble. </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see you next week.&rdquo; Another beer appears in front of my face, adding several more items to the list of reasons to grab Chris and fuck him senseless. </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks Chris.&rdquo; His feet move towards the door so I let my eyes linger on another fine piece of Jericho.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your back.&rdquo; Now THAT sends my head straight up, but it&rsquo;s only to see a flash of blonde hair and golden arms as he leaves. Despite my injury, the agony and the likelihood of not being able to wrestle, things are looking up.</span></p></lj-cut>"

"event","<p>In amongst all the ficcing on my To Do list, (ITRV, Requests, Firsts Challenge) I have just signed up for Yultide!!<br /><br />Well, I never said I was great at time Management. *g*<br /><br />But, I have received an excellent prompt and am hightly motivated...see how that goes closer to the day. But the absolute last thing&nbsp;I want to do is disappoint my Requestee. I have enough trouble with being late for ITVR posts let alone someone's present!<br /><br />I'm putting my 'Dear Santa' letter here as well as on the comm, &nbsp;but as I have very little idea how to do a link back to this journal I'll prbably just put it there as well. Hate to have my Author running around like a mad thing looking for my Letter.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />Dear Yuletide Santa.<br /><br />Thank you so much for whatever you'll be writing. Don't worry about me in any way, I'm easy to please :)<br /><br />Like most&nbsp;Requestees I'm just really happpy to read anything in these obscure fandoms, but if your after my personal taste then here goes. I'm into characterisation above everything else. Elaborate prose can be beautiful, but give me a strong insightful conversation any day and I'm yours. Good dialogue is great and humour =win, although I tend to cringe at crackfic but it depends how cracktastic you want to be. I'm also an angstwhore (weird seeing as I love the humour I know) but more the 'silently pretends they are fine while dying inside', rather than 'woe is me, I'm gonna go jump' sort of thing.<br /><br />My fandoms..<br /><br />X-Force. Ric/Star. I can never get over that this pairing was validated by THE CANNON WRITER, but if slash isn't&nbsp; your thing, then a friendship fic between the angry young man and his alien, best bud would tickle me just fine.<br /><br />Fantastic Four. Johnny/Ben, Johnny/Norrin. Liked the comics, adored the movies. Johnny Storm is my definition of favorite fic character. The young, cute, mouthy, hothead, who pulls the pigtails of the one he likes then runs like anything when they take him seriously. I like him with Ben or Norrin, because with Reed I cannot get over the married man thing and that is strangely very important to me. (shrug) But friendship or team fic is great too.<br /><br />Hercules TLG. Hercules/Iolaus. Very simliar to both the above..cute, mouthy, hothead and steady, tolerant friend becomes something more. hmm...I'm beginning to see a pattern here! Really anything you like...only I prefer Iolaus not be a whining girl that needs a slap upside the ear. He kicks ass in canon after all.</p><p>Battlestar Galactica. Apollo/Starbuck. Now this is just getting repetitive. ;) Humour or angst is great, some action, flying vipers, saving lives, being best friends or an ole' married couple. Whatever rocks your boat, I think my preferences are pretty obvious.</p><p>Please have fun and if you have an idea, ignore everything i just said and go for your life.</p><p>Happy Yuletide!</p><p>Jadedoll.</p><p><br /></p>"

"event","<p>Lj keeps unsubtly suggesting I might want to make a post sometime soon. Hmmm. I thinks it gets worried when we leave off for a month and starts nudging and making comments like 'Can't think what to post? Try listing several things about yourself you want to change.'<br /><br />Gee, thanks for that. Positive re-inforcement is the go here apparently.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, I'm not gonna do that beacuse it would be lame, BUT I will resort to my list-making genetics and throw out bullet-points of current goings-on in JadeLand.<br /><br />*&nbsp; I am now officially knocked-up. Husband is responsible and very much enjoys my new bust-size. Midwives are beautifully unconcerned about anything and thus I am the same. No weird craving yet, I'll keep ya posted.<br /><br />*&nbsp; Husband responsible for my expanding waistline has been DLing all the latest WWE PPV's so I can squee with hormone-induced silliness over Randy being EVIL all over John Cena's ass.<br /><br />*&nbsp; Hunter is BACK!!!<br /><br />*&nbsp; My baby nursery is bright emerald green. Yes, I am one of those people allergic to pastel, hopefully the tenant's (thank you RK for that reference) eyes will adjust to the colouring when born.<br /><br />*&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn in BACK!!!<br /><br />*&nbsp; Haven't seen recent Raw's or SmkDown's but the PPV's are enough to keep my Musi inspired at the minute. randy is eating my brain, but Hunter has never left and then....<br /><br />*&nbsp; CJ IS RUMOURED TO BE COMING BACK!!!! SAVE US 222!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />*&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;love capitals, they are the loud-mouthed friend of the subtly intense italic.<br /><br />Hmmm, not much else.&nbsp;<br /><br />May the sun shine on you wherever you are....unless your like, in the sahara or something and I then I wish on you shade.<br /><br />*kiss, kiss*<br /><br /></p>"

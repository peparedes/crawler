Running, talking, wily, and wildly exploring the world.

She interacted with the toys she was given today in ways even I didn't expect. She showed new dexterity building with the blocks, and made up little scenes and interactions with the cloth doll-house of bunny-people. 

We had a lovely little Christmas here. It left my imagining the pleasures of next year."

"event","My dad just took Beatrix with him to the store because my dad is awesome. 

I thought I'd take this opportunity to brag because that's what parents do. 

Beatrix has developed a knack now for memorization. She reads her favorite books to herself, repeating what's on the pages or just talking about the pictures. She has Dozens of favorite books and asks for them by name -- their proper names or names she makes up for them. 

Over thanksgiving weekend she learned to say her ABC's all the way through. Since then, when the mood is right, she'll recite her numbers to twelve. It's not really counting yet, but soon. She has started to count objects up to three -- maybe four. 

Here's a picture of her singing the alphabet for her aunt Noni.


<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/3109691856_4ebb1700fe.jpg?v=0"" />


Beatrix is almost twenty-one months now, and beautiful. She loves trucks, grover, ratting-egg-things, and the moon. She takes good care of her dolls; tucking them in, changing their diapers and feeding them crackers and juice. She likes to brush her own teeth and wash her hands. She likes to watch the fire and likes music. She asks for songs by name as well. 

Her current favorites are Beach Boys, Little Deuce Coope; Octopus Garden by the Beatles, Love to be Silly by Cat Power and an inappropriately Kill-Bill type number called Chick Habit by April March.

She's such an aware vibrant, talkative person. I'm looking forward to her first real Christmas. It'll be such a surprise for her. 

And the weather station thinks it'll snow tonight. Her first snow since she could walk. Life is full wonder when you're adventurous and not-quite-two."

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/floatingtide/pic/00001syk"" alt=""This is how to do it."" />

&nbsp;Fancy.

That machine is a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/One-Laptop-per-Child-Give/dp/B001GB87EI/ref=tag_dpp_lp_edpp_img_in?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1226984650&amp;sr=8-16"">Olpc</a> which I think is a fine little machine, even if it's not for everyone.&nbsp; Next to it sits the crown-jeweled queen of all lattes; the salted caramel latte from Cafe Marche. The presence of this partiularly glorious drink means I took the picture while writing at the Fifth Street Market downtown. It's a nice bricky old building with lots of light and a train tracks outside the north windows. There, evey fifteen minutes or so, a train drifts by clanking and lowing its horn. That perks me right up.

I'm still keeping up with Nanowrimo. The first week was easy as I endlessly introduced important characters doing interesting things.&nbsp; In week two I had to bring them together. They had to talk and do story things and <em>get moving.</em> Awkward. I spent most of the week at least a thousand words behind on word count. 

Fortunately, I have now discovered the lay of the plot. Things are rolling.&nbsp; I'm about to write a&nbsp; shoot-out scene . I've never done that before. Thought it's not a shoot-out in the western or action movie sense, I'm still looking for ward to it.

"event","In my last real post I said I've been able to return to writing. Now I can say with confidence that the difference between now and a couple month ago is amazing. It's really been a zero-to-sixty change.

There's been a grand convergence of Beatrix accepting other caretakers, those caretakers being available and small but exhausting issues drying up and blowing away like summer seeds.

I feel really good right now. 

I started Nanowrimo last week, just to see what I could do. Damon and I both did. I wasn't really expecting to keep up, but even the attempt has always been very good for me. To my surprise, I kept up easily the first few days. Then I flagged a bit as I tried to figure out where I was going, but then picked right back up this weekend. 

What I'm writing may not be readable, but the words are mine and there's lots of them.

Over the years Nanowrimo has allowed me learn things I'd otherwise be to wrapped up in ""writing good"" or ""finishing stories"" to explore. In the end I end up knowing a lot more, even about writing good finished works. 

I can't keep this pace up. I'm neglecting a few things and eating too much junk. Fortunately, some things can be put off and I haven't let Beatrix's diet stray into junk -- and this commitment has helped me.  

Maybe I'll never touch the novels I've written again, but they're wonderful nonetheless. In December I hope to start submitting work again and to work on my backlog of first drafts. 

Life, however, is life and we'll just see."

There were still so many moments I wish I could have written down in order to hold them forever. Dated, posted and pressed in a flower book. 

Maybe now I can. Damon and I have worked it out so that I have late evenings to myself. I'm not getting quite enough sleep, but that's life. 

The short version of why I have been off-line is that Beatrix hates it when I type. It's understandable, I bet I really disengage from her. 

She developed a sixth sense for the tap of keys. I'd get halfway into the first sentence of an important email and she'd rush up to cling to my knees. Then she'd switch back between asking me to do something -anything- else and sneaking her hand up to pound on keys herself.

I decided the war between baby and writing would not be won on this front. I had to strategically retreat from typing in her presence. 

Though I've never lost it entirely, writing has been the hardest sacrifice. Even so, I'm loving Motherhood.

But that's a topic for another day."

I can't believe it's been months since I've written this down. 

So. Awesome. 

She's been very physical and independent. Lately, she's happy playing on the floor and singing out babble-talk to the world. 

A few weeks ago she started to do this Quasimodo scooching crawl with one knee up and her foot on tiptoe. She never got far but was pleased with herself. Smug, even.

Last week she mastered the two-knees-down technique. Yesterday she crawled all the way across the room to get at the tiles I've been putting in. 

She's wanted Damon and me close, perhaps as a response to her new independence. She needs to know that crossing the room wont misplace her parents, but even with this sudden cling, I've really gained some new freedoms. 

The writing feels real again. Not toe-in dabbling, but real storytelling work with all its joys and frustrations. 

I think for the next year or so I'm going to work on producing good things quickly -- or, more accurately, finding my optimal speed. In writing, there are certain points in the work where I need to keep my pace up or I'll loose the thread of the plot -- I get bogged. A similar thing happens in editing. If I push too hard at some things I work them away to nothing. 

There are other times I do need to go slow for best results. Refining this process will be vital in the next few years. Beatrix will help me. She's my uncompromising Olympic coach.

"event","The goal is five thousand words this month.

I've been working hard to find writing time but I not letting it stress me. That is a great thing about how Nanowrimo almost a game. I've discovered that late-night after a day of baby-care doesn't work well for me.

I've discovered that time can be pressed, squeaking and protesting, into an average day. Also: Damon is a saint among baby-daddies.
&nbsp;
For a while I was keeping up nicely with the Nanowrimo one-thousand six hundred six words a day. Eventually life tripped me an I had some low-or-no word count stretches that I haven't been able to do much catch up from. Some days I squeeze in two thousand words, but not often.

So right now we're at the last week and I'm about ten-thousand words behind. 

In other words: I. Am. Awesome. 

I've averaged a thousand words a day this month. I'm really getting the habit of it. I'm improving my speed, and I like a lot of what I've put down. 

I still have this vague, lottery-player hope that I'll somehow double my speed over the next week and&nbsp; I'll&nbsp; ""win"" Nanowrimo by reaching that fifty-thousand word goal.

Hope and pressure make my fingers dance on the keyboard -- but winning this one is really not the point."

"event","I'm now part of a review site! Presenting <a href=""http://www.pixielate.com"">Pixielate</a>. Here's my first <a href=""http://pixielate.com/booksmovies/?p=26"">review</a>: The Bartimaeus trilogy.

It has been put together by the inestimable* <lj user=""divadrummer"">.

This makes me particularly happy, because I now have the extra excuse I need to read the books that really, really catch my eye. I've gone a couple years now primarily reading what was lying around, what was cheap and what people lent me. 

Nothing wrong with this, really, but it's no way to go through life. 

So I was grateful for the opportunity to join this crack teem of opinionated volunteers. I started by liberating The City of Saints and Madmen from the library. Rumors of this book have intrigued me for a while, and I'm glad I've finally read it. I haven't reviewed it yet, I went for something easier.

But for loyal fans (Hi Mom!) here's my mostly-unhelpful one-sentence review:

<div align=""justify"">Reader beware -- Jeff Vandermeer's City of Saints and Madmen has a decadent beauty similar to Peake's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gormenghast_series"">Gormenghast</a>, but it also has all the same  flaws of character.

There. Now, if I explained those character flaws, this would be a real review. But this is all you get.

Each time it's dramatically improved my habits and ability to finish stories. (Although my grammar and spelling always need physical therapy to recover, but they're the sickly orphans at the best of times). 

These years I come out of November feeling strong and capable. 

Now, to my surprise, <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">Nanowrimo</a> is working again. I don't think the baby would have let me do this even a month ago, but the timing is working out so far. 

We're one week in and I'm only about a thousand words behind. No sweat. I'm re learning how to write at full tilt. No looking back. I needed this prod. I'd been falling into the trap of thinking everything I wrote in my rare and precious free time needed to be diamond. 

This was counterproductive and silly. 

And I don't even care for diamonds -- jewels or prose.

"event","Yesterday we climbed our local Mount Pisgah with a couple hearty friends. I'm not sure the tallish bump is really, technically a mountain, but it's a good hike I've only done a couple times. 

We pushed Beatrix up in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/InStep-Run-Around-Jogging-Stroller/dp/B000C9DZ0G/ref=pd_sim_sg_2_img/102-8499574-9986520"">sporty stroller </a>my mom found for us. It worked beautifully, I think it could go on much rougher hikes but I chose Pisgah because it had smooth graveled trails. Unfortunately, I forgot how much of the time those trails would lead us into the sun. Beatrix was shaded but Damon got a burn. I hope no one else did.

Pisgah is a spring hike. Volunteers cultivate wildflowers in its meadows, and those tidy trails are walkable when other hiking spots are slurries of mud.

I want to hike again soon, and I can. In that way the experiment was a success. Next time it will be all shade trees and mosses."

I'm not talking about the usual mess and neglect of a home with a infant. Nope. I think she can scramble apliances with the power of her mind.

Here's the list of things that had to be replaced since her birth:

-Washing Machine
-Refrigerator
-Electric Kettle
-Computer's Wireless card
-Major section of plumbing
-Car's starter

And she's only four months old! Imagine the future. School districts will have to return to one-room prairie-style teaching. Armies will be reduced to fighting with their bare hands. 

Maybe this will go into remission, but comic books have taught me that mutant powers only get stronger. Possibly she'll use this power for good.

Unfortunately, comics have also shown that super-powers and toddlers don't mix.

Sweet love,

When you smile it's always for someone. You like to sing and talk and look people in the eyes. You smile at me. 

Otherwise, you study. You've been exploring your own hands and your fathers scritchy face. Not long ago, you discovered your own toes and have been fast-friends with them ever since. 

You've turned into a party girl. You want people and color and dancing all day. Last week my whole family took you camping at the festival. You loved it all: stilt-walkers, crowds, trees, music, sun, grandparents, candlelight, masks and vaudeville.&nbsp; We carried you everywhere, dawn to dusk. I don't think you've ever been happier. 

And in all that strangeness, I started to think  about how much you trust me. It's an amazing trust. I could get lost in it. Your father and I trust each other, deep and complete, but it's an adult trust. Like adult love, it might be oceans-wide but it's not the same as you. Your trust is the sky and moon and all the stars. 

In a way, I think your trust has only grown since you've learned that you are yourself, complete, and I am&nbsp; your mother-other. Maybe now we are in the apex of that trust. I am smaller and more fallible than your wide-eyed mind can imagine, but you'll learn. 

My heart wants to keep you in a nest of silk and flowers. My heart wants you to grow up vinegar-sharp and tough as nails. I hope I do right by you.

What ever happens I'll care for you. Sometimes I'll care for you by taking myself away -- because if you don't learn independence from me, it might never take root in you. For you, I want to be a better person. 

I love you, my Tigress. For you, I'll do my best."

"event","Now it's been long enough that I feel like I've always had a baby. We've settled in together. I'm even settling in to the rapid changes.

This last month it was almost impossible to do anything but hold her. Now, more and more, she's happy to play with her the jangle and dangle toys. Or she'll sit next to me on the couch, attempting to capture her own toes. Everything about her has grown. She's top of the charts for hight and weight. For infants, thriving is an official medical term and she is. It makes all the small trials so much easier, calmer, when I know that on the most basic level my care is working. 

Now Beatrix is pouring her energy into other kinds of growth and it's incredible to watch. She practices using her hands - she grabs faces, touches flowers and pulls toys to her mouth. Her favorite toy is a little blue plush spider with a bell in it. It came with pack of baby-cute bugs: butterfly, cricket, ladybug. But Mr. Spider is the one who never runs out of legs for grabbing and nibbling. Fingers are good too, her own and other peoples. Right now I love telling people, ""Bee loves frilly dresses -- to eat."" It's true too. I've seen her get frustrated when she can't get her outfit into her mouth. 

She's also begun to talk and sing. She'll often start with a tentative string of vowels (Oh? Gahoo? Hi?). I love it, and cover her with kisses. The she really gets into it and will ululate like someone warming up&nbsp; to yodel.  It's fantastic. 

She smiles a lot too, particularly when someone looks her in the eyes. (Oh those eyes!) She's at her best in the mornings. I take my time greeting her when we wake up -- giggling, tickling, foot-rubs and smiles smiles smiles. 

Almost as good is the next part of her day when she sees some simple, mundane and totally amazing thing. She gets such a look of determined interest on her face. ""I will understand this,"" the look says ""and tomorrow,<strong> the world</strong>!"" &nbsp;

This story is and isn't about P.T. Barnum. It's about bitter old dreams. It's about egress as a concept and word but the title word never appears in the body of the work. It's a story that takes place over tostadas on a paper plate. 

The story might be to slow or wishy-washy. Even though I'm getting better with pacing and solidity. The Egress probably has more flaws than words, but it's done.&nbsp; My writing time is precious. It's probably a good thing that I can't endlessly nibble at my stories anymore.

"event","So I decided to work on some writing things between now and Wednesday. It's an experiment to find out what I can do around Beatrix. 

She must have heard me, because she made other plans. Today Bee nursed. That's it. She'd go on for hours and take only a 15-20 minute brake. It was amazing. I think I've lost several cup sizes. 

Bee was in a good mood throughout. She didn't have any significant stomach aches or spit-ups. She took it slow and steady but with a latch like a remora. 

So I had a very nice, slow day despite being thwarted. I listened to the radio and read most of a light novel.

I'm not at all frustrated about the writing. Today I wanted to type some things in from a fiction-exercise journal I've been keeping, but what's really cool is that I've been writing fiction even if I'm dazed and needed.

Here's what I do: Years ago <lj user=""selkith""> gave me a fat little journal that has a quote from <em>The Wizard of Oz </em>on every page. So I open it up and circle a couple of interesting words or a phrase; ""witch's kiss,""&nbsp; ""bodies of bears"" or ""gulf, ditch, walk across."" Then I write a story about them on only the open pages. They are small and partly taken up. I'm guessing I can fit about two hundred words on each. Mostly these are idea's, scenes or sketch-stories. A couple of them are pretty good mini-drafts. 

All of them are thrilling. There's no space for the story to breakdown or get dull. It's all first-love -- one supremely brilliant idea after another. 

Before Bee was born I was trying to teach myself how to edit and refine my stories. I wanted it to be fun, and not like I was grinding against my own work. Not like I was beating aginst the gaps in my own skill. It was fun, but I'd almost forgotten the rosy glow of a new idea. 

Thanks Bee."

I've been playing with her more and more (not just dress-up!) She makes demanding chirp-barks when she wants something I'm not immediately giving. Just today she lay next to me happily experimented with bird-shouts and bell-sweet-yowls. She grinned proudly and watched me for reaction.

"event","I've spent the last couple weeks holding Beatrix close, and it's been wonderful. She'll be six weeks old this Tuesday. I've been watching her change every day. Her eyes were the ink-dark blue of a newborn, but weeks ago a silver ring appeared around her pupil. Now her eyes are half pale - a gloaming sky kind of color. 

She's using her eyes more. She's tracked things since minutes after birth and stared into faces. Now she watching bright colors and lights. Sometimes when I start to play with her she gives me a look that says "" Mom! I'm staring! Get out of the way.""

Her colic has stayed away. She gets hungry-cranky most evenings and sometimes still wrestles with tummy pains, but she spends most of her time in happy-baby mode. This is eating, sleeping or grunting something into her diaper. In between she has her short bouts of looking at the big, bright, sunny world (out of the way, Mom). 

Beatrix has also gotten butter chubby. Half of the pound-a-week she's been gaining seems to be going into her cheeks. Despite the weight of cheeks and chins, she can mostly hold her head up. Also she grips my fingers with such strength that she can sit up as she holds on. 

She's discovered that her hands are useful -- she rubs her eyes, sucks her fingers and, for comfort, feels me up. We hold hands as she sleeps. 

Ahhh, love."

"event","Bee seems to be shifting from spending hours or days cholicy to spending an hour or so fussy and then going chill. Her cholic may return, so I'll enjoy it while it lasts.

Today she let me make myself breakfast. Egg and toast! With avacado! And tea! I put her in her car seat while I cooked. I rocked her occasionally and dance and sung to entertain her. I think she was&nbsp; the most engaged with how I passed in and&nbsp; out of bands of sunlight. 

Now, she's asleep in her seat. I can rock it with my toe as I type or nibble. 

Aahhhh...."

"event","Yesterday was the eight-year aniverary of the day I married <lj user=""gooddamon"">. I still love this guy. He's, incidently, a wonderful husband, and now I know he's an increadable father as well.

He tried to get the day off to spend with us, but wasn't quite able to. We made evening plans.

Beatrix's was cholicy in the morning, but she's getting better and I'm getting better at dealing with it. At noon <lj user=""divadrummer""> came to help me out. She arived with fancy sandwiches, then cleaned the house and then watched Bee while I showered. 

Afterward we had tea and talked like grownups. It was great.

By this time Beatrix was calm and sleepy. I bundled her into the car then picked Damon up from work. As a celebration, we went to <a href=""http://www.sweetlifedesserts.com/index.htm"">Sweet Life,</a> the local fancy-cake and sweets shop.&nbsp; We shared a strawberry cheesecake and a slice of lemon-cream layercake and a single cup of spicy chai tea. 

Beatrix slept in her car-carrier as we rocked her. A woman in a group told her companions that Bee looked like a little flower. Damon kissed me.

Family is good."

"event","Saturday saw a lot of the folks from the almost-commune where I spent a lot of my childhood. I miss the land -- a couple hundred acres of deep and roming forest that I haven't seen in years. We're going to have to vacation there this summer. 

Over all I had a great and restful weekend. Friday through Sunday, Beatrix was mellow and fun. 

Then she turned on us. Last night she was inconsolable, again. She kept us up, then spent today cholicy. I've spent maybe twenty of the last twenty-four hours holding her. My butt keeps going numb, I'm coated in spit-up and restless. 

She has a particular cry when she's also geting worn out and frustrated.&nbsp; ""Aaan! Laa! Aaan! Laa!"" 

I'm better at handling her cholic now. It still makes it hard to eat or bathe, but I know we can both ride it out and I just hold her until she calms or I really have to put her down. 

It looks like this jagg was a twenty-four hour thing. She's sleeping in Damon's arms now.&nbsp; Hopefully tomorrow I'll post about all the wonderful, lovely, cute and perfect things about her -- the things I was thinking about over the weekend. 

Right now it's time for bed.

"event","We three had a really nice lunch with <lj user=""Divadrummer""> and <lj user=""silketh"">. We talked about many non-baby things including <a href=""http://http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi2t58CRmbU"">this</a> -- waxed Greek beefcake Vs. vaguely transsexual Persians. Personally, I like the Persians, but then I always root for the guys in eyeliner. 

Afterward, we walked over to the library. Bee's second trip their in the nine days of her life. Our library has these big spiral stairs under a vast skylight. The stairs were much easier this time.. I'm getting my strength back. 

Speaking of which, today, for the first time, I tried to get some real writing done. I'm working on a birth story, including all the surreal and squishy bits. It's hard enough to remember these things without waiting for years to go by. 

In the late afternoon I went out for writing. A group of us met at the upscale market with thick-varnished tables under big sunny windows. I wasn't sure I'd be able to do anything and prepared myself to show of the baby and go home -- either to take care of myself, or so I wouldn't disturb those who really came to write. 

Lucky for me, between feedings Beatrix stayed snug-quiet in the sling in my lap.&nbsp; I'm slowed down, of course, but I can work.  We stayed for over three hours with Bee quite happy and looked after.

Tomorrow I think I'll return to fiction, at least for a brief stint. Maybe I'll do a quick writing exercise. 

The roots of my life have been disturbed, but they're resettling in what soil they find."

"event","<strong><lj-cut text=""The last few days were so good, though little Bee is a hungry, hungry hippo."">Monday</strong>
We visited mom's dance troupe at rehearsal. They danced their new 80's number for the three of us. I loved it and wished Beatrix were old enough to really see it, but they were dancing for her and I loved it. 

We also had breakfast at a Morning Glory cafe -- our first meal out together. I had pancakes with strawberries and we took turns holding the baby. We didn't have anything to put her in except our arms, but that only improved her waitress-melting powers.&nbsp;  

Everyone asked how old she was and were shocked to hear ""six days.""

<strong>Tuesday</strong>
We sang ""happy week-old day to you"" to Bee in the morning, then spent the day lazing and lolling. She started high-gear nursing. I could hardly get a break. She'd take just a quick nap and then start making a little ""O"" of her mouth&nbsp; and would stick her tongue out it the way&nbsp; that means ""feed me.""

&nbsp;In the evening I drove her for the first time.&nbsp; My Dad, and Mom <lj user=""tangojean""> had been taking us everywhere until I felt strong. Physically, I've been fine for most of the week, but It's a little scary driving a baby around. 

I went to my writing group to show Beatrix off. I nursed her before going to the bookstore, but she immediately had to leech again. I had fifteen friends and acquaintances to help me get over any public-feeding shyness. They formed a half-circle around my chair; talking, joking and trading baby-advice. 

Afterward we went to see Gra, who's convalescing at home after surgery. We hung out on the end of his bed and talked about the eyeball-sucking phenomenon that happens around babies. Everyone stared at Beatrix as she lay on the bedspread. For as much as we looked at eachother, we might as well have been talking on the phone. 

She nursed twice in the hour-and-a-half we stayed.
<b>
W</b><strong>ednesday</strong>
Damon brought me breakfast in bed. He's been doing that a lot. Today's offering was toaster-waffles&nbsp; toped with&nbsp; yogurt, apricot applesauce, and berries. I ate one-handed, the other hand breast-pressed Bee so she could breakfast with me.

So she ate. Again. And again. 

I do love it, especially the little ""ah?"" sound she makes when&nbsp; she latches on.&nbsp; But we planed a late-morning walk and didn't manage to leae until four. We put her in sling and hoped. Finally, she napped. The sling rocked against my belly. The pear-trees were in bloom. The spring grass grew new and shaggy on the neighborhood lawns, and all was right with the world.</lj-cut>"

This weekend pretty much sucked, but y'know. I'll get over it.

Finally saw The Day After Tomorrow.
Very very nicely made, but the ending was very.. dissapointing.
Watching-..well, listening to Secret Window. 
Ergh.
This thing with Cody isn't working.
I feel terrible because I don't like him like 'that'. Ficking Justin had to basicly force me to go out with him.

Well once again, I'll get over this easily. I just hope he will too. 
Considering what his friends said..blah.

Whatever. He'll get over me. I'm not someone worth getting hung-up on. :)

Alright, as you can see, its very late at night, and I'm still running on two hours of sleep plus loads of caffine.
Mm, not good. Not good at all.

"event","Why do people get so bent on killing themselves when things get bad?
It's the cowards way out.
Show the people who're making life hell for you that you're better than them. That they aren't getting to you.
If they're doing this to you, they obviously aren't worth getting so worked up about.
This is directed to nobody in particular.
I've noticed about seven of my so called friends weaseling their way out by OD'ing, then whimping out and puking whatever it was up.
Or cutting themselves again.
Or crying themselves to sleep. 
There's no need for that.

Well, I guess I can play the same game.

"event","I disgust myself.
I cried over Papa because that song, 'Angel' by Sarah McLachlin started playing.
I need to get over this. It happened like three weeks ago. My dads almost over it, he hardly cries anymore. I shouldn't cry, either. Dad was Papa's /son/. I was his /granddaughter/. Papa's Girl. I shouldn't cry anymore. Not over a stupid song..

I really can't help but think.. 'If he wasn't so stubborn, and he went to the doctors when he felt sick a half a year ago, would he still be here?'

He made tons of promises.
He promised to go to my sisters graduation.
He died.
He promised to spend a day with me, just me, since we haven't done that in about a year.
He died.
He shouldn't have made those promises.

I know it isn't his fault he died, but it just reminds me how much of a wonderful person he was, thinking about the promises, and I can't fix the hurt my sisters feel.
He hardly ever did anything for them or with them, and I know he tried, but he was always sick.
He went to my graduation, and for missing a few of their concerts, he promised to go to their Graduation for them.

My sisters cried the whole night. 
I know it isn't his fault, but I feel like the reason they're so sad is because I told them he'd get better.
I promised he'd get better, and he wouldn't get any sicker, and the doctors would make him better.
I lied.

Moultonborough Teen Struck By Car, Beaten


MOULTONBOROUGH, N.H. -- A teenager was struck by a car and then beaten by its occupants, police said.

Kory Becker, 19, of Moultonborough, was taken to Lakes Region General Hospital with serious injuries after Friday night's attack, police said.

Becker was walking with his brother and an acquaintance along Glen Forest Drive when the car struck him and pulled over. In the ensuing fight, Becker's brother picked up a baseball bat dropped by the assailants and went after them, police said. The two men then fled in their car. 

Police arrested the two men later.

The driver, Michael LeBlanc, 20, of Laconia, was charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated and possession of a controlled drug. Passenger Shane Plummer, 20, of Meredith, was charged with unlawful possession of alcohol. Both were taken to the hospital to be treated for injuries from the fight.

Police said more charges were imminent.
-------------------

Yeah, I know, I don't know him, but can you shoot me for being scared or upset? I hope not..christ, when I read that I fucking cried. 
How can people be so cruel to stoop as low as beating someone after hitting them with a car? Sure, I don't know the whole story, but either way, its mercilessly cold.

Usually I like mercilessly cold things, but not when their towards the same stranger I see every day..

this is weird for me to say, but my prayers are with his family.. and i hope the fucker who did it gets a life time in jail.

but thats just me, and i have a feeling i'm going to get lots of hate comments, so i'll just stop talking..

night, everyone. <33"

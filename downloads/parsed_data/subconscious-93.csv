"event","alright, so i have my first set of tests tomorrow. not looking forward to that at all.....gay as all hell. i have math and french, french isn't so bad (although it's harder than i thought it'd be) but math is gonna suck majorly. ugh! other than that things have been great. i'm seriously loving the college life. i've met so many fun people and my class schedule's pretty good. i went to matt's band pracice earlier tonight. they don't sound so bad anymore. i think i'm adjusting to the music, but metal's just not my thing i guess. they have a show at some dive bar in seattle on 30th so i think i'm going to go check them out. the ""under 21"" part might be a little tricky, but matt says if i'm with the band then they won't care as long as i'm not ordering drinks. matt's working an all-nighter tonight.....which pretty much sucks for him 9:30 pm to 6 am at work and then classes at 8:30. shitty deal if i ever saw one. anyways, that's it for me...bye!!"

"event","well, this is my last week at home starting in 46 minutes. it all seems kinda final. like i'll never come home again, and when i do, it;s not really my home anymore. i don't know how i'll do on my own, but i'm excited to find out. i have all this new stuff. new computer, new bedroom stuff, new school stuff, new friends, new boyfriend (sort of...) and i feel like i'm leaving all my old stuff behind. all night i've been sitting here listening to music and looking at pictures from way back to senior year and missing everything. i can't mess up now. this is it. i'm 8 years away from everything i've wanted since i was 4 years old. i'm 8 years away from an md. it seems so much closer now, but so much more uncertain. what if i can't do it? what if i screw up my grades this first quarter and it dooms me? can 3 months change the course of your life? i don't know. i've been telling myself that i'm ready for this, that i can handle everything that comes at me, bu what if i can't? what if i'm not ready to be my own person? i'm not so much afraid of leaving as i am of making my own decisions or failing on my own terms. the uw med school is one of the most competitive schools in the country and 15% of the applicants actually get in. those are some terrifying odds.....and i'm suddenly terrified."

"event","i am so bored. i'm sitting here watching madtv and talking to my dogs....wow, i have no life. pretty soon i'll probably go visit matt at work or something. it'll give me something to do. i start school 2 weeks from today and i'm so excited. i move out next saturday and that seems so soon. i'm a little nervous for that 'cus i'm gonna go live with someone i barely know, but it should be really fun too. me and matt will still see a lot of each other so that's really good. anyways, that's it for me."

"event","so yesterday i got my nose pierced. i absolutely love it, i thik it's adorable, but i keep yawning or sneezing and i'll suddenly be like ""wow, my nose hurts"". it's the wierd adjustment phase right after you get a new hole put through an extremity. anyways, i'm so proud of everyone for not chickening out and getting something pierced. yay for us!! we're so brave. other than that i haven't really done anything exciting. well, maybe just one thing, but i'm not going into that on an online webpage.....anyways, i'm off to watch tv or do something exciting. bye!!"

"event","so me and john ended things for good last night. i felt so bad. he looked so sad and we were both crying, then we stopped, then we were crying more. it pretty much sucked a major one. but now it's over so we're going to try to rebuild our friendship and work from there. as of right now, i'm just kind of depressed. me and matt were talking about it last night (he's good with this kind of stuff) and he just said that it was always going to be hard for me and john, but that maybe fixing the friendship would help to fix the relationship one day. it really helped to hear that. especially since it was him and he's not exactly impartial. other than that, i move out in 2 weeks and 2 days and school starts in 2 weeks and 6days. it's coming up really soon. i'm ready though. i've ordered my books, i've gt my dorm stuff, i applied for a job at the university bookstore (fingers crossed) and i've been making lots of new friends up on campus. i know where my dorm is and where all my classes are. i can't be anymore prepared than i am. let's see how i do......"

"event","so this is going to make me sound like a fourth grader, but i can't live with my sister anymore. i can't do this. we fight all the time and i seriously think she is incapable of being happy unless she's hurting someone. she's like the anti-christ. i'm serious. she puts on this front to the world like she's got everything. the boyfriend, the job, the grades at the best school and she doesn't. she pretends like she likes everyone she meets and as soon as that person leaves, she tears them down and laughs about it. she did shit for grades at college 'cus she found out her little sister wasn't going to help her like she did all through high school. her and kevin fight constantly and i personally wouldn't be surprised if he was cheating on her. i already know he lies to her about not smoking pot 'cus she'd freak out on him. as for the job she hates....not as perfect as she'd like evryone to think. i don't like fake people and even more, i don't like sharing a house and a car with one. so i got some boxes and now i'm packing up my shit. i don't know where i'll go or if i'll even leave, but who knows, maybe it will make my mom remember she has two daughters, not just one. i'd miss my dad though. he's pretty great. and he knows me and my mom aren't very close. it's not that we hate each other, but me and my mom are just so different. i'm not girly and perfect enough for her. my mom and my sister are a good match for each other i guess. my dad's fantastic though. he's the most supportive person in the world. when i told him i wanted to play volleyball, he got me the stuff i needed and practiced with me. he's always been like that. we have these dinners once a week when just me and my dad would go out to some retaurant, didn't matter where, and talk about everything. my dad knows everything about me, even the stuff i can't tell my mom. it seems wierd to some people that i'm so close to my dad 'cus a lot of girls are just closer to thier moms, but not me. anyways, that's it for me"

"event","ahhhh!! i love the weekends. even when i haven't done like anything all week, the weekends just seem so much more relaxing. like some part of our brain is programmed to be more relaxed on saturday and sunday (unless you're catholic like me and then sundays are a little hectic). it's also fun because everyone who works all week is home so you can spend time with them. so right now i'm bored on the phone with matt....who's not being very interesting right now. today's my sister and her boyfriend kevin's 3 year anniversary so she's borrowing my make-up and doing her thing to get ready. i swear she takes longer than i do to get ready, and that's saying something. on a different front, i've decided i need to see tom just so that we can get things between us all cleared up and back to being friends. i miss being able to talk to him. he's a good guy, i just think me and him never really worked out romantically speaking. well, i'm about to go out so i'll wrap this up. weekends are great!"

"event","so my laptop's gone to shit. we've trid reformatting it like 5 times and it's not fucking working at all so we're saying ""screw it"" and taking it down to a shop to have it fixed. i just need to have it better by the time i leave for school or i'm fucked in a majorly bad way. let's see, what else is new?.....me and matt have agreed to be friends for awhile 'cus i'm just not up for a whole new relationship right yet. i'm enjoying re-learning the single life. it's kinda nice not to be tied down to someone right now. i've talked to kelsey some more and she seems really nice. we're going to go have lunch together next week so we can meet each other in person. i don't know if we have much in common yet but we seem to be getting along alright so far. we still need to work out a printer situation but that's like the last kink in our roommate relationship. at least she's not some jesus-freak or a prude or something like that. her boyfriend's name is matt too which is a little freaky. i guess he also goes to uw and lives in a fraternity so she's going to get to see him a lot. what else to talk about.....me and john are still great. we're dealing with everything really well which is great right now. the last thing i want is to have to deal with him on top of the whole ""last month at home"" thing going on with my parents lately. i think that's it for me. bye!!"

"event","so my friend told me about this site and i thought i'd start one up since i'm always online anyways. i guess i'll hop right on in. i've been seeing this guy matt for like 2 months now and he's pretty great. he's smart, athletic, good-looking, and very driven towards his goal. what's the problem you ask? i just got out of a two year relationship and i don't know if i want to jump right in another one. matt doesn't do things half-way so it's either a serious relationship or just friends. i'm screwed! then there's this other guy, tom. he's a great friend and we used to have a thing for awhile but he's just so....young. i know it sounds stupid coming from me since he is 2 months older and all that jazz, but it's the whole maturity thing i guess. matt's 4 years older than me, and as many faults as he has, john's 2 years older so i've never really dated guys my own age. they just seem so young. not my style. but he's (tom) always thought that when me and john ended, him and me would end up together. and i'm really not seeing that happening. i tried at first, but you just can't make yourself feel something that's not there. then matt blind-sided me. i don't know where he came from but he's come into my life and messed up my carefully organized universe of chaos. now all of a sudden i'm worried if my flirty ways could hurt his feelings or by not dating him i'm making some mistake. i've never been uncertain with boys. i grew up running after my older male cousins so they're not like some foreign species to me. and i love dating....needless to say. this is not fun. i know i should probably just take a break for awhile, but honestly, i don't remember how to be single anymore. kinda sad huh?"

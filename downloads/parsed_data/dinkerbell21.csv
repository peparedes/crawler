"event","First off, let me say that today Natalie and I were supposed to go up to robinson, go on a shopping spree, but the snow sucks and now we can't! I'm so mad, I'm gonna kill someone! All I wanted was to buy some new stuff! but, I'm not worrying, I'll just go this week sometime!

Anyways, last night was fun!Jenna, Jenn,Natalie, Raelynn, and I all went up to the lube and got a megabucket of wings! On our way up, we were pretty mad that Andy's Candies was closed, we wanted some gummies! So when we got to the lube, our waitor's name was Matt and he was sweet! we all ate like 50 wings and talked about the funniest things! We were gonna go to the mall after the lube, but we just decided to go to Petland instead! Jenna went inside, saw a baby Sam and just fell in love! She was staring ate it, like tearing up she loved it so much! She kept saying, ""OMG I'm gonna cry, I love dogs so much, I'm gonna be a vet!"" It was hilar! Jenn and Rae decided to buy a miniture Rat for Jenn, and I swear to god Jenn is in love with it! We watched the ferrets, because theyre fun and then watched some hampsters get it on for i sear to god 5 minutes! It was so funny we all just stood there and laughed! Then we decided to go home!

We stopped at weirton medical center, jenna dn rae peed and natalie stole a cone! We then went by Central, stole 2 of those huge cylinder things that r usually cemented to the ground and placed each one at Mr. Hlivkos house! We met up with Vaness and Nicole at Tim Hortons, they followed us to Dick's house and when we passed, he was getting out of his garage and went by the construction thingys, and then walked away! He pulled out, and we thought he was gonna go to like a bar or go get beer, but nope he went to church, we felt bad after that! We went to Jenn's, set the rats house up, named him Bennie/Stuart and then played extreme fooseball! Jenn's sweet, she sounds like shes really plaing grunting all the time! Me and Jenna blew, and lost evrytime! I went home and went straight to bed so I could wake up early and go shopping, but that isn't happeneing~

Tonight I gotta work at 5, and then I'll probably do nothing, Saturday night is everyone's boyfriend night, so while mine's not here, I just do nothing! But it's okay becuase he's coming home in 5 days! I'm excited to see him, and spend some time with him, I haven't in almost a month! 

I think I'm gonna go fill out my NHS thingy, since it is due on Monday, and I haven't started at all! So maybe I'll update tomorrow, if not, o well!"

"event","I'm sitting here since I've been up at regular time, but we have a 2 hour delay! I swear that makes my life fab! I was up kind of late last night!

Yesterday Schro & I took Rachelle driving! It was an experience! She's not that bad at all, for like her first time driving! She likes to be a speed demon sometimes and run stop signs haha! But we'll teach her better!We we're gonna go to the mall and get her phone fixed, but I really didn't want too, so we didn't!

I called Joshy on my way home and he told me Jeremy was out of the hospital so I decided to venture out to Steuby by myself and visit him! I stopped by Bobby Evans, picked up my paycheck, hung out with my favorite girl Lynnita and some of her friends for a few then went tanning! I stopped at the mall to buy Jerem a card and a cookie cake! I stopped to see him and we hung out for a little bit! He is doing much better than I thought! He'll be better soon & i love him! I visited with his fam and then sent my way back to Toronto when I realized it was like almost 9! Thats like my bedtime! I went to bed at 10 and woke up not wanting to go to school, thank god for my delay!

Anyways, I'm gonna lay around a little before I gotta shower! byeeee alll!"

-Cady: You're not stupid, Karen. 
-Karen: No, I am actually. I'm failing almost everything! 
-Cady: Well... there must be something you're good at.

-Cady: No no no... Anything else? 
-Karen: Well... I'm kinda psychic. I have a fifth sense.

I've been busy lately, rarely get online anymore and never update* I don't know what I'm always doing, because I only work 3 days a week and never really have homework..I think I like to make myself busy so my life does not just mean the internet, tv, and telephone!

Anyways, my car got back from the shop wednesday night, because it needed to get a new starter! Thank god for my mommy, I don't kno what I would do without her, she always makes sure I got what I need! I even offered to help pay for it, but she wouldn't let me! I love her so! So everything was good about my car and I had a new refreshed feeling when I drove it to work on Thursday knowing that after I was done, I would open the door, put the key in the ignition, and it would start without hesitation! It felt so good to know I could depend on it, for the first time in a while!Thursday I made a little bit of money, but I gave it to fresh whom I bought baseball clothes off of! Yes!, yet another pair of sweatpants to make me look even more dirty at school!

Friday I was all up and ready to go school and everything was good, but Pat was late, I was gonna call him, but I figured since he was late I didn't need to waste more time to make him even more late! So he calls me and tells me he's looked himself out of his room so I should drive to school! I'm okay with that and all so i get in my car and go! While I'm at a stop sign I slip on the gravel/snow/ice, 260 and thought I was gonna go over the hill! Thankfully the hillside on my other side broke my out of control spinning car in the middle of the road! I don't really care, I didn't hit the hillside bad and I know I didn't hurt the outside of my car! As I get on the highway I pick up speed and my steering wheel is crazily shaking! I just figured I threw my car off balance and just would take it to walmart! I call and tell my mom and jeff, theyre like its okay* Then my day went fine! I came home and my mom made me an appointment to get my car fixed this morning, in hopes i didn't fuck the whole axial on the wheel* I love her again, for taking care of my problems* Josh came in then i went to his house we hung out! He got me some presents that I love, because he's sweet like that! We watched Muppets take NYC, and it was funny, then watched Ocean Water! We didn't finish it because I feel asleep and by the time I woke up we just decided to sit and talk like we always do late at night at his kitchen table!We had fun, and I love him for coming in and seeing me this weekend!

*Wednesday I got my hair done, its chopped, but its okay nothing you can do about short hair and it's a change for me anways! The new color is pretty, but the higlights are not quite what i wanted! They blend to much, so Scott is redoing them again this tuesday! I love him, even though I think he's gay*|

Tonight I have to work at 5:30, hopefully I will make some money, I need to get my nails done, I might do that today-who knows?!

So that's all I gotta say-I'm gonna go and watch the notebook's special features & deleted scenes because that is the best movie ever made and one of the greatest books i have ever read-i looove it!*"

"event","I haven't updated in forever! Last weekend I just hung out with Joshy* We had fun! I can't wait until the weather gets warm and when he comes in we don't have to be all stuck in the house! This week I was busy doing my Spanish project, working, getting my momma and jenna birthday presents, and then doing what i did today--dredding the ACT! 

I took that stupid test today and I hope I did better than last time, but I probably didn't! Joshy tells me I need to concentrate on one section at a time when I take it, but of course he didn't tell me that until after I took it today* He's a goober! I just might not go anywhere I want to go to college, if I don't raise my test score, god my life sucks and I'm an idiot! Just messing, but I am really stupid!

Tonight I have to work, but I really don't mind, I have nothing else better to do! I hope I make some money, I just want to have money again!

Monday is Valentine's day and although Josh isn't here, he already sent me some presents, which I loooved, and he said there's more on the way* I wish he could be home, but he's coming in this weekend for the long weekend! yayyy!!

Tuesday is Natalie's birthday, I gotta make her or get her soemthing, because she's my BF and I love her!We're gonna go to robinson and go shopping then-what fun!

So I've been having those hate myself days recently, I just hate winter, it makes me feel gross* I feel so white, I long for the sun! I can't wait to be able to walk outside see all the pretty flowers and wear shorts! Im sick of this coldness!* So as a quick fix, I'm getting my hair all done this wednesday, that should fix my all the boredness I have bottled up in myself that I get this time of year!*

Well I really have to get ready and get a shower for work! Maybe I'll post later, or maybe I'll forget until next weekend, like last time! peace out!

p.s.make sure everyone goes and looks at reanas livejournal, the pics on there are hilar, as always*"

So yesterday I had a better day in school and all that and then went to Joshy's house and gave him his brithday and Valentine's day presents! He loved them all, I knew he would, and then we just watched a little Sex in the City and layed around! We just watched TV all night and were lazy, that is after we got our Giannamorres that made me sickly* I feel asleep during the Manchurian Canidate, but woke up to see the good parts! After that I brought my little butt home and back to bed! 

I was supposed to go tag today for the Key Club so we can raise money for fireworks, but I slept in like a little asshole, god I suck at life*But hey, its okay because as soon as I woke up, I did my normal look outside and I saw Mike Ludewig and a carfull of kids tagging on my street, at least someone was tagging, and laziness and sleepyness didn't get to anyone else but me!

Today I have to work at bob evans at 530, and I'm hoping for a good night, because if I don't have one and make some money, I'm gonna get in my sad, I hate my life mood again, because I swear nothing makes me more mad then going to that place and getting nothing to show for it. Then I'll probably just go to Josh's and hang out*I'm glad he's in, I missed him and it's good to see him!

So I'm gonna go get a cinnamon roll from McDonald's and lay around and watch TV probably, maybe I'll post later! byeee*"

So i go to work and immediately put someone on break and get stuck with a 9 top sharing it with deb* i get excited theyre nice and i wnat a good tip* but of course i go on break and when i come back, no tip. they left 5 dollars on their credit card, great* then i get a table and then get my outs, so really i didnt have 1 of my own tables and came home with not a penny* all that trouble of getting there, finiding someone to pick me up, and i make nothing* fuck bob evans! then i get asked to work on my day off and i would love too, but josh is coming home and i def need to spend time with him or i might make myself go crazy* i get attitude for it, when i shouldnt have been asked at all, my manager tom is a real asshole* one day their gonna push me so far, im gonna just quit* i cant wait until eat n park opens, im so getting a job there, anywhere but bob evans* i swear im not a bad waitress i get asked to come in at 6, after the dinner rush then get put on break when i do get tables, and then get told to leave* i waste more gas money than i make*

So i call natty up crying, bc i hate everything and i hate my life right now, tonight has sucked and i fucking hate bob evans* i advise NOONE to ever work there, bc its all bullshit! so im still in my real upset mood, i called josh and he isnt answering so ill probably be pissed when he does call laster when im in bed and be a bitch, bc thats just about my kind of style i have going for me tonight*i just wanna talk to someone and he isnt answering! god im gonna go cry!"

I swear ive saved so much up and never spent any of it, now /i wanna spend it, and its all gone*

Yesterday I saw hide and seek with Shell and Pat, it was okay, kept me guessing, but I really didn't understand it. I was dissapointed with the end, leaving us knowing that there will be a second one maybe in2 years?! o well i didn't fully understand until lunch today anyways when they reexplained it all to me* I swear i'm an idiot*

Today i went to school did the whole learning thing and had a pretty good day. I secretly heard ppl talking smack on me today in chem, and they don't kno i know* o well who would ever talk of my life, its so boring, at least make someone elses life get the attention you give to mine, bc really, my life is pretty lame* it's only times like this where the controersy comes in, any other time, i laugh and have fun, in which only a few people laugh with me* i kno youre bored with my life, its okay though-i'm not*

Josh wants to go to paris this summer, i laughed at him* like where would i get the money?, he replies with::

I feel so lazy and I really don't want to do anything at all* I have to finish off Josh's birthday and Valentine's presents so I might do that later and go pick up my paycheck* I probably won't though, I'm just to lazy to get up! 

Yesterday at work I got yelled at for my nails of course, and made shit money, I need a new job so bad-I can't even take it! The managers just say it's the time of the season, but I really hate it-I need money and I'm just not getting it there* Maybe once Eat'N'Park comes to Steuby I'll go get a job there, probably will all the other Bob Evans ppl*

So I really don't have much to say* I miss Josh and I can't wait for him to come home this Friday, if he does end up coming home like he's supposed too* I really hope he does*

So I'm gonna go lay around, take some asprin bc I've had a headache all day and it sucks* I think I'm gonna go get a Snickers Ice Cream bar from kwik king too, I'm addicted to them* and i might tan, but I really don't feel like going in the tanning bed bc if I do that, I kno I'll come out with a headache worse then I already have*"

Nat and I went to Legal to get our hair done together and I go tmy makeup done also, lemme say I will never let anyone do my makeup again, for the second time, I have taken it all off and cried because I have looked like a dirty 80s prom queen! My hair was alright, I fixed it up a little, she made me look like a karate kid the way she put my ribbon in, but I fixed that and ended up liking it*

Mike came up to my house with his mommy around 7 to get pictures and then we went down to Natty's G's to get pictures with her and Scott. Then we went to the dance, got pictures, and started having fun* Everyone looked hott, loved everyone's dresses, and I'm sure everyone had fun! Natalie and I randomly danced on people that probably didn't even kno my real name* It was fun, I didn't feel like a retard, and really didn't care what anyone thought of me, that made for a better time. I danced like a retard, and had so much fun* The stupid snow ruined out trip to Damon's although we should have went, everyone said University Blvd. was fine* We went to Margaret's, and they were out of everything in the world, but everything was still fun* Mike was a good date, treated me well and we has fun doubling with Nat and Scott! It was extra cute to see Nat and Mike hang out, they're so funny becaue all they do is bitch, but they love each other* I love them together, they're 2 much fun*

After that, I went to Raelynn's and then Jenna and Natalie came too* We just watched Napoleoon and layed there until we fell asleep* We did sign Jenna's cast though, although she gets it off this Thursday*

This morning Lori took all of us to Eat'N'Park and we had fun* Lori is so funny, I swear I love her! 
She invited all of us to Splash Lagoon in the beginning of March, I think I'm gonna go if I can save up some money, it'll be so much fun*

So today I have to work, probably get yelled at for my nails again, but at least I'm gonna keep em on until Thursday because they'll make sure I take them off by then* 

My room is a mess from getting ready and all that stuff yesterday so I'm gonna go clean it and then get ready for work*"

Props to everyone who I know is still there now and making sure we all have a great time tomorrow, it really means a lot* Today I didn't do much, got my report card, especially with my A- on it in band, like WTF?, but we won't get into that*

Yesterday, Natalie, Raelynn and I cut out of school at 10 and went up to Robinson! We had tons of fun, bought Joshy some really nice things for his birthday, and got our nails done! 40 dollars! haha!* I really love those 2 girls, I swear I never laugh as much as I do then when I'm with them, of course unless I'm with them and Shell too, or just with shell*

Since I've got my job, I really haven't had money or even time to just go and blow it on things for myself or on others. So I always see things and just wanna buy them for people, because they remind some much of them, but i never have the money to do so. But when I went into american eagle and saw the shirt that said i love to swing on it, i had to buy it for shell. i didn't look at the price, check in my wallet for money, i just bought it. and it made me feel so good! I know money cant buy happiness, but i swear it makes people happy. I love to just spend my money on other people, it makes me feel good, i mean i bought a few things for myself yesterday, but i really just spent my money on others. i got my moms birthday present done, and joshs almost done, but i need to get some stuff for valentines day! ill have to do that this week, after i get paid and make some money! 

so i was in a really good mood at work yesterday, after i shared my kindness to rachelle, bc i never tell her how much i love her, the pudding i gave her put the icing on her cake! I got my nials done also yesterday, 40 dollars, but i must say, they look hott, the best my nails have ever looked, rhinestones and all, but of course theyll be gone, bobs has already yelled at me for them! but hey screw them!

Bandformal is tomorrow! I wish joshy was home so he could come see me! i miss him! I really like my dress, im excited for my hair and i think im gonna have the most fun yet* yaya! so i need to do all my girl things, before tomorrow and make sure everythings ready before my hair appointment at 130! Im almost sure of what im doing after the dance, and it definately doesnt include drinking! no booze for me!

Yesterday I had to work to work for Erica because she had a baby shower; so I was really excited to work because Natalie didn't work on Sunday, that dirty bitch, because she wanted to watch the game! So 10 minutes before I'm gettin ready to leave for work, Natalie calls me and tells me that Linda called her off because business has been really slow and we really didn't need all the waitresses tonight. I was mad, I love working with Natalie, we fuck around and have tons of fun, so without her, I really was kind of mad I didn't get called off. I go into work and Linda tells me I wasn't supposed to be there until 5, which means I could have tanned, which made me mad and I had to sit there for a 1/2 hour with fucking Billy who was high (as a kite-bell!-haha!) But when I got to work, I kicked ass, a little girl drew me a picture and let me play that little handheld nintendo game with her and I made 25 dollars and got a 25 dollar paycheck! I think besides when I started working there and people came all the time because of the Big Red/Central Football games, I haven't made that much money since then. So I was really excited and shoved it in Natalie's face!

Farrah Fay, my precious blue baby Corolla has been fixed! I don't think I've ever been so excited to drive my own car! I missed her, and it seemed like I never used her, until she wasn't avaliable to use! Jeff put a new battery in her for me, and I appreciate it so much, unlike my momma sometimes Jeff knows safety comes first-haha! My mom was just gonna let me drive the silly thing until it just permanently broke down then I would never drive again, which is good for her, no gas money to give me then, but I tricked her and my abby is back in full throttle! Now I can take my girl Lynnita home from work, and we don't need crazy men to jump my car for me! hehe*

Today I went to school, hated it, of course, me and Raelynn talked about how everyone hates us, o well and then I almost killed Hlivko. I love that man, but he has to stop with doing a section for 5 days, I can't stand it! After school, I went tanning and picked up my perscription, saw the wonderful Paula & Piff at rite aid, i love them!, and then cashed my paycheck! 

Thursday Natalie and I are cutting school and going to Robby to get our nails done, search for Valentine's presents for our men-hah- and then getting birthday presents for my josh! he comes home in 9 days and we're celebrating his birthday and Valentine's day, i better get on that! It'll be fun!

I watched the challenge last night, it sucked and I was really dissapointed, one of my fav shows let me down! way too easy of a challenge, but I must say if Tina, Robin and Ibis were the finally 3, the girls would have totally kicked ass! 

So now my mommy needs help grading papers and such so I'm gonna go help her and then later on tonight watch the real world and my super sweet 16, because I am obsessed with both of those shows! Unitl the next time I update, everyone else keep posting, because I am highly entertained by reading everyones livejournals! byeee!!

P.S. If anyone watched MTV when we were in the 4th grade, think back to Sifel and Oly, the sock puppets, they really were the shit! I miss them and Precious Roy, he always made suckers out of girls and boys haha! My mommy and I would late night watch that show together! haha!"

Yesterday the crazy snow came which disabled me from going to work, of  course i was excited when they called and told me that! I got real sick in the afternoon and I'm still sickly* I'm all stuffy and my sinuses are getting to me! I cleaned my room yesterday and got rid of lots of things I was keeping, just to keep* I'm proud of myself, it's hard to throw away all the things that really mean nothing, but you are emotionally attached too! Then i went to bed! I woke up this morning at like like 4 because my sister was on the phone and was talking with her door open! it seemed extra loud because the rest of the house was asleep and very quiet. I watched room raiders and then went back to bed! Then I was woken up today by a call from Pat at 9, but i answered and he didnt say antyhing! bastard! he must have accidently hit a button in his sleep* So today I have to work, i think at 5, i'm not sure, i got a new schedule and left it at bob evans! darn! now i have to call them and ask then later on today* so i'm gonna miss some of the game, but i'm sure i'll be back to catch the best of it! 

Anyways, i really hate this snow~it fucked up my car last week and now it sometimes starts, and sometimes doesn't! I have to take my moms car to work today, which is cool because I like my moms car,I don't think i've ever been able to take it out of Toronto before! Not that it is anything special, but its for sure nicer than my farrah fay!

Joshy comes home in 12 days and I'm excited! When he comes in we're gonna celebrate his birthday, which is on the 10th and valentines day, which is of course the 14th. I haven't really got him anything for his birthday because he got the whole frickin mall for his birthday! He needs more summery clothes, and I'm not even sure if those are out right now, but I'll find him somethin nice! Because of the snow, and my silly car, I haven't even got a chance to run to the mall! Jeff says my car is getting fixed tomorrow I think, thank god!

Anyways, band formal is this weekend and i'm kind of excited! I really like my dress and I'm doubling with Natalie, which will be tons of fun! I ripped my nails off over the weekend so when I get them done they'll be extra pretty and new! I love my nails, thank god for bob evans or I would never be able t get them done-haha! 

Well, im gonna finish my laundry and then get a shower! Lay around and then go to work!BYeee!"

"event","So I haven't came across anything really funny or even the least bit funny at all to post in here, but I'm making a comeback! 

On Friday night, Josh and I went to South Hills Village Mall where after we were done shopping sat down in the food court to have a little 'Great Steak & Potato Company"" (our fav!). We were just randomly talking about things when he asked if I was still getting my A's in school. I replied yes, and he told me I better keep em up! I told him it'd be hard to do it next year and I'm gonna be like pulling teeth to get an 'A' in English next year. He asked y? and I said all the seniors say it's really hard. He said, well who's the teacher? I said Toothman. Then at that moment we realized I said' I'm gonna be like pulling teeth to get an 'A'. I didn't even realize I said it* We laughed because her names Toothman, pulling teeth-get it? Well, Josh and I thought it was funny* haha*

anyways...

We were watching a football game that same night on Tv and I saw a gauy's jeresey and his last name was 'Moss' I said, OMG! I kno him, I've hear of him before....'Pete Moss!' haha* Then Joshy told me that was a type of moss and that wasn't his name...i thought i was so smart..o well*

That's all for the funny things that have happened to me...until next time i come across something funny, you'll read about my boring life! PEACE OUT*"

Weirdly enough, I was just watching 'Boy Meets World"" when I was grabbing my stuff and walking out of the room when the picture and noise went offf, at first, i just htought I hit the clicker. So I come back in, to where I am right now, and I try to turn the TV on with the clicker. It makes the TV on noise, but I don't see a picture or hear anything. So, I try again. Nothing happens. A few seconds later, I hear a loud like pop noise and I start to smell something. My TV, I guess, has blown up* I don't kno what happened or what's going on, but it's werird and I don't kno what to do. I unplugged it and called my mom and Jeff. None of them answered. Oh well! But, I must go the stinky smell is making me sickly* What a day!"

"event","Last night I went to Piff's where suprisingly, not that many people were drunk! I'm not much of a party girl so I sat there and just kind of took it all in* Brittany was smashed which was hilarious and Reana was good for a laugh too! After I've went to the party, I've decided that those kinds of things are not for me-I'm not a drinker never will be and it's probably best to keep it that way* I wish I would have hung out with Josh, but at least I got to exkperience the party atmosphere for a change. Something really funny did happen...I'm sitting on the couch with Nicole DeFranco and we're just listening to everyone talk and I hear Pat or Jess say, 'OMG! you remember that movie Independence Day? Didn't that happen on New Years?' Cole and I could not believe our ears! Did someone just ask what day the movie ' independence day' took place on? We sat there and laughed and called them out on how incredibly stupid that the didn't kno the reason the movie was called independence day was because it took place on the fourth of july* Then jess adressed the whole room and said? 'what time does the ball drop'? the funny thing is these 2 comments made, both said within 5 minutes of each other, the people that said them were as sober as ever! It was funny* Anyways, Piff had a crazy dog who made me and Schro just laugh our asses off while it tried to eat Pat's face, Nicole's legs, and Britt. I had a good time, I missed Natty not being there though! Anyways, I'm bored so I'm going to stop bring you all with my pathetic life! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!*"

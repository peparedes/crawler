"event","Tonight a very important event transpired, and not many people understand why it had to happen the way it did. Looking back on it, maybe they'll discover it, but perhaps it'll remain an undiscovered truth by the masses. Taker was defeated by Brock Lesnar at Wrestlmania 30, bringing an end to his undefeated Streak of Wrestlemania wins.

Now, it's not just that his Streak had to end that is important, but that someone like Brock Lesnar had to take it from him. Both of these things are very important to realize, and I hope that after reading this you'll understand why I have come to this particular conclusion. Before that, however, I'll make a proper introduction into who I am.

I'm a wrestling fan born in the late 70s and started watching in the 80s. Naturally, this makes me a Hulkamaniac. I watched the commercials, I tried to keep up with as many of the shows that I could, I watched Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. I knew all the names, I knew almost every signature move and how to perform them. I never got into backyard wrestling, but I did practice several moves on my friends to show off; because of such, I actually believedd in the stage fights that were happening, since the moves that I did really did hurt.

Over the years, my enthusiasm towards wrestling never waned. Yes, I found out about all the tricks of the trade, how a vast majoirty of the moves were choreographed and the refs were the ones directing the traffic during the improv that was happening in the ring. I saw the rise and fall of legends, the death of many of may heroes. I went from watching WWF to WCW in the 90s, rooting them on during the Monday Night Wars, and occasionally being able to watch ECW when I could figure out where they were hiding on the television.

After WCW was defeated by WWE, I occasionally kept up with their brand, but the Monday Night Wars had definitely created an impact upon me when it came to watching them. My heroes had taken a severe backseat to the established roster, and I didn't appreciate how some of them were being treated. Sure, today several had gone on to make names for themselves within WWE, but it was a hard fight to do so. But, I knew all the names of those on the roster, and learned the various different storylines so that I could enjoy parts of what I was watching.

That's when I came to understand that there was a wrestler named The Undertaker who had been scripted to never lose a single match when it came to Wrestlemania. This wasn't an unique concept for me; over in WCw, Goldberg waas scripted into never having lost a single matching since his debut (No, I don't acknowledge the one loss that he supposedly had during the Taser Fight, basically WCW's version of the Montreal Screwjob). I was impressed that they had managed to keep the story going for as long as it hadd been, and also that they were able to keep the audience tied to their target regardless that everyone knew in the back of their mind that Taker was going to win when he got into that ring.

Around 2009, I found another wrestling organization. Now, I knew that ROH, AWA, NJW, AAA, etc existed, I just had no real way to tune into them since I was stationed overseas and didn't have access to television. iTunes, however, allowed me to subscribe to this new organization and keep up to date on their shows. This is how I came to start watching TNA; and how I learned to enjoy wrestling once more.

One of my biggest heroes of wrestling from the 90s on had always been Sting. I was glad that he never joined WWE while several of his locker room buddies were. I watched d the interviews that Sting had regarding WWE and agreed that they would have destroyed his image if he had jumped over to WWE when everything was going down. By now, those that have been reading through the dirt sheets see where I'm going with all of this, but stick with me, I'm getting there.

Every year, Sting resigned with TNA/Impact Wrestling and kept going, but there was always that persistent rumor, a rumor that I always hoped was still a rumor because of my distaste with WWE. However, this year Sting decided that he wasn't going to continue signing with Impact Wresting and let his contract lapse. Also this year, Taker and Lesnar started showing signs of the storyline that would lead to the result of Wrestlemania 30.

Taker was destined to lose. Even if you haven't seen the match between Lesnar and Taker during WM30, you know that Taker is getting ready to retire. Mark is 49 years old, well into the sidelines and backstage development age. However, WWE management has never been able to find someone that could take the Taker's Streak and break it with such force that the people would genuinely HATE the person whom was responsible as Taker got later into the years. CM Punk even developed a rabid following, and the destruction of Taker's Streak then wouldn't have garnered the same push as someone like Lesnar.

Meanwhile, Sting is being approached by WWE now that he's a Free Agent, and he's been overheard at Q&A panels talking about wanting to wrestle against Taker before he retires.

So, why was it necessary for Taker to lose this year? Because neither Taker nor Sting (age 55) are ready to retire, leave their boots in the middle of the ring, and help out the new blood. If Taker had faced Sting when he still had his Streak, there would be confusion from the fans. Do you sign Sting and have him face against Taker for one last fight and lose because.. The Streak? Hell no.. Sting (like Taker) is a wrestling icon, there's a reason he's been nicknamed The Icon. Well, then do you have Sting defeat Taker and have him end The Streak before retiring? Hell no.. That's worse than what everyone is carrying on about with Lesnar defeating Taker.

So, you have to put them into a position where the only thing on the line, is a Win/Lose.. perhaps not even that. But, you also want to put them on the biggest stage that you can.. Wrestlemania.

So, put a contract in front of Sting letting him know that he gets to take on Taker as well as other financial selling points, and you have yourself the biggest money grab in a long time.

WRESTLEMANIA 31:: Taker vs Sting.. Clash of the Legends."

"event","So, it's been awhile since I've posted anything... as such, I'll give you the low-down on what's happening. This mostly only will be understood by fellow Cammies, but I'll try to incorporate some non-Cam stuff that's going on.

1. DST - So, the DST election finally got run, and I'm finally the DST of the Domain. Now, it's just a matter of a smooth transition from no VSTs for three of the four venues that we have, to three new VSTs... or possibly two VSTs with one of them running two venues. I hope to avoid this, but I've already been informed that if it's necessary, one of them will run for two of the venues. Fortunately, Jared is staying on as the Lost VST.

2. New PC for Requiem - After several months of dealing with the approval process, several weeks ago I got my Childer of the Morrigan approved. It's actually rather humorous to watch the local Humanity 7 vamps deal with this Humanity 3 guy that just doesn't see things in the same light as they do. Something that I've recently discovered, though, is that I might actually end up taking a few dots of Obfuscate although I was hesitant to take anything past One due to this lack of interest in hiding that he's a monster as per Mask of Tranquility. However, Mask of Tranquility may be suspended as it's not immediately activated power. Nice....

3. SSEC - For those that know me & my job, SSEC is the name of it. For those that don't know, I'm a field engineer/network technician who travels the US to various different sites and physically sets up networks for wireless access points that are used for hand-held scanners in some businesses. Usually I'm out and about for weeks on end while I'm driving to a site and then staying out there before driving back. These trips can go out as far as Pennsylvania while driving. The company feels that if you will be hitting several sites, you'll just drive out to the first one, deal with it, drive out to the next one and eventually get back to Arizona. If you're heading out as far as Pennsylvania without hitting any other job sites, they'll fly you out then... However, from Arizona to Colorado/Wyoming without a rush, is a drive. Anywho, I've recently found out from my boss that he appreciates the work that I do when I'm in the office so much that he would rather I stick around than go out on jobs. So.... more than likely, I'll be office-bound more than I have been... No skin of my nose, really.

4. The Reset(tm) - Back to Cam stuff here. So The Reset(tm) is happening in less than a month now. They've supplied plotkits for all the venues that are available within The Camarilla, and unfortunately people aren't too happy with them. I realize that they didn't have much time to work on these plotkits that they've put out, but I can't say that I'm all too satisfied with them, myself. I'm going to be running them in the Domain, because it's been put out by Global, but I'm also going to do my best to make the players happy with the end story, regardless if I have to do a little bit of tweaking on the parts of the plotkits prior to the endstory. It's only fair to the players.

5. Movie Reviews - Hey, those long-time readers of mine out there know that I used to do movie reviews here. Know what? I'm bringing them back. Expect most of the reviews to be of movies that have been out on DVD/VHS for awhile, but that's because I don't have much time/money to go out every weekend to see the new things. If there is a movie that you would really like for me to watch, just shoot me an email to: reyvinnyte@yahoo.com with the subject of PLEASE REVIEW THIS MOVIE! I don't care if I would never think to watch it, I'm willing to put myself through hell to save you from the possible anguish. Also, those familiar with my review styles will get a laugh out of seeing possibly horrifically done movies reviewed properly.. And I don't mean the censored Roger & Ebert shit, I mean the in your face, oh my fuckin' God you gotta be kidding me... what the fuck is that?! type of review.

That's it for now kiddies... see you on the flip side!"

"event","So today is April the 1st... Also known as April Fools' Day. There are two holidays that I just love when they finally come around, Halloween & April Fools' Day. I'm a child at heart, and have strove to continue to live the life that my Grandparents set before me... Live each day as if you were no older than you were when you first enjoyed life.

However, there are some people that do not share in my enthusiasm for such holidays, much the pity to them.... Here's an example.

So, our esteemed US NST within The Camarilla had decided, at 12:01am on April 1st, to send from his personal email address (not his Cam Officer address) an email to the SE Region that decreed the upcoming Reset Plotkit was that everything was a dream. Those that were a part of SERE '01 would remember that was the actual plot for the C/A game held on the second night... It was all a dream.

After the message got spread out from the SE Region, people started popping up, calling for poor Clint's head... stating that he should get a DA for it, even get removed as the US NST. Meanwhile, several of us were congratulating Clint on a well-played prank. Heck, when I first saw it I knew it had to be a prank, if for no other reason that Clint Hauser is the NST, not the PL: Reset... so if a plotkit got handed out, it would have come from David, himself, or supported by David, this was obviously not the case. As such, a prank indeed... and since it was my favorite holiday, definitely was a prank, and a well-played one. Unfortunately, there are enough people who care little for holidays like this and are easily offended by the nature of the prank.

Now, before you respond here, I've got two things to say:

1.) Please note that in my Profile, that I've made it clear that I often will make comments that will offend people. If you are offended by my words, stop reading... it's really very simple. I will put things behind cuts within my initial post if I feel that they will immediately offend people, but if you venture into my responses page and get offended there, please don't try coming at me for that... I will do my best to remain civil, but I am not making any guarantees.

2.) I understand that there is a Reset about to happen. I realize that he didn't immediately state that it was an April Fools' Day prank. I know that you might not have known about the reference to SERE '01 in the original email. But, again, this was an email that Clint sent to the SE Regional List from his PERSONAL email address not his USNST email address."

Our DST Election has FINALLY started up. So, once more I'm tossing my hat into the ring and seeing how many people are going to do the same. I'm not sure of really anyone that has any sort of interest, so it might just be myself. If it isn't, it should be an interesting race with the person(s) running against me, since I do so enjoy a good contest when it comes to elections.

Secondly, the RC of the SW Region has recently released a statement regarding usage of vulgar words across the OOC list, putting a vague threat of DAs against such people that would do so. Of course, this has started up a bit of a line of comments from various members of the SW region regarding this claim, and even comments from our NST on the matter. It should be really interesting to see what our RC has to say in return to some of the comments, as she hasn't yet responded due to real-life obligations. And, as I always say, real-life comes before The Cam, so I'm a patient lil Cammie for now. That might change if some of the responses that she makes is contrary to what I believe she was trying to say with her original email."

"event","Alrighty... so it's been almost two years since I've last posted something here... and we all know that I wasn't a huge poster to begin with... but now that I'm doing relatively nothing when I'm actually at work, I've got to find something to pre-occupy my mind with. Especially with everything that's presently happening in one of my past-times, The Camarilla. If you're not part of it, don't worry about it, it's nothing that affects the non-Cammie, and there's nothing that you can do to help out the Cammie part of me.

So, I will do my best to actually start writing stuff in here again, letting people who still are reading this to find out how the guy they knew so very long ago (if you haven't heard from me recently) is doing these days. If you can't wait until the next post, feel free to put something up here to remind me and I might, MIGHT, put something up sooner than that to actually recap if I get enough people truly curious...

Following the attack upon The Others that held him and several others that had been captured over the ages within a subterranean storage room, destroying The Others and freeing the slaves that They kept, Absinthe pulled himself and another out of the Hedge, only to find a world far more alien than the one he left...

Would equal out to some fun time at the paintball field. Not so... Apparently they were having a tournament that we didn't know about instead of another tournament that we had found out about before heading out, and they weren't letting any new teams in even though several teams had forfeited. So, the eight of us that traveled the distance to get there ended up heading back to the base, only after finding out that next Sunday, it will be open field for anyone interested.. I'm pretty sure that we'll bring the large group out again."

"event","About a week ago, I downloaded iTunes while visiting Korea. This was only because I wasn't able to find the latest Evanescence CD (yes, they have a new one) anywhere, and finally got tired of hunting and decided just to legally purchase and download it, rather than try to find all the different tracks on something like Limewire. Unfortunately, this also allowed me the chance to see all the different albums and videos that iTunes has to offer.. Thankfully, I didn't have enough time, and was able to prevent myself from going crazy in the music store, and only was able to grab one other album, and two Tenacious D music videos.

I must say, before I reveal the other album that I downloaded, that Evanescence's latest one, is a continuation of their acheivement in music. It's definitely worth the purchase.

The other album that I purchased and downloaded was the latest in Weird Al's ongoing collection.. Straight Outta Lynwood is definitely another worthwhile download for those that have enjoyed his previous albums. Such songs as ""Trapped In the Drive-Thru"", ""Confessions, Pt 3"", ""Canadian Idiot"", ""White & Nerdy"", ""Do I Creep You Out"" which continue to show Al's capabilities of paroding any song out there, as well as the ones that he develops on his own.

""What would you do if you had boobs??""

After her surprise at the guy's inability to give her a specific thing, she turned to me who was just coming around the corner after hearing a break in the silence (I didn't hear her ask the question initially, so she had to ask it again when I said ""huh?"" to her ""How 'bout you, Ambrose?"")

I chewed on my lower lip, rolled my eyes upward and pretended to think on the matter (really trying to figure out which one to give her for the first item). Defaulting to... ""I reallyyyyyyy can't even begin to start down that list of things."" Which caused her to get a confused look on her face.

By the time that I came back she was looking over at one of the guys with the comment of ""I couldn't just look at it for the entire day, though... I mean, it's not as good looking."" As I looked over at the guy in question, I deduced (with a good deal of success) that he had informed her that he'd probably spend a good deal of the day just admiring the boobs that he developed since he had the mind of a guy with the body of a woman, and then had asked her if she wouldn't do the same thing if she had suddenly developed the body of a man with the mind of a woman.

So, now that I'm equally bored, I'm gonna ask the same thing of our avid readers here... If you woke to suddenly find yourself in the opposite gender's body, but still retained your own mind... How would you react?? Lord knows, I would be hard pressed to get out of a shower if it had one of those massage heads ;)"

"event","So I'm having to throw away a plotkit that I've been working on for the past month into the trash... Why? Because Hawaii had an earthquake.

Now let me elaborate on that.

When Columbine had it's school shooting, people stopped running ""Trenchcoat Mafia"" groups in respect for the travesty that happened.

When 9/11 happened, we re-evaluated associating any terrorist events with IC actions.

And when a 6.5 earthquake hit Hawaii a week ago that did little structural damage and no fatalities or injuries, plotkits get thrown into the dumpster if they reference earthquakes that would equal or rival that.

Guess I'll have to start thinking about not running any stories that involve snow storms just incase another blizzard hits the US that causes people to get stuck at home? Or typhoons just for those several storms a year that run through the oceanic area?

It's a good thing this isn't the Old Cam anymore where we had to deal with things like Thunderwyrms in Werewolf: the Apocalypse who could create apparently natural disasters that could easily knock California off it's platform. Because then you'd need to make sure that all the STs out there put their big bad weather guys on the bench.

But, hey, maybe it was worse than I thought it was... Maybe there's ongoing coverage for this earthquake like there was for the Tsunami that hit India, or when Katrina hit Louisiana. So, I went to CNN.com and looked for the terrible earthquake that hit Hawaii. Hrmmm.... nothing on the splash page on the front page. How 'bout the world's top news stories... Wow... nothing here about the Hawaii earthquake. Hell, rice in Japan is getting more notice than this big bad earthquake that I'm destroying a plotkit for. Oh shit... better take a look through my plotkits to make sure that I'm not dealing with food shortage...

So... Hawaii has a 6.5 that doesn't get any further coverage a week or so after the fact and I'm being told to scrap a plotkit in respect for the devastation that hit the nation. Pah.. I'm giving more respect than the nation that I'm supposed to be respecting is giving.. Gawd this ranks right up there with ""political correctness"" in terms of my distaste.

Oh, and BTW... no CoC here... it's not a Cammie LJ, but an LJ owned by a Cammie."

-=-=-

Self-Understanding

Well over a week ago, I had a revelation regarding something that I had thought I had understood about myself. Obviously, the old saying of ""Learn something new every day."" doesn't exclude personal understanding. For those that know me well, you already know that I tend to be shy around women, extremely so if it's a beautiful woman (see an earlier entry regarding this matter). However, I have since learned that there was more to it than that.

It appears that I have a problem with large groups of people. When there are far too many people for me to handle, I tend to clam up and have an interest to get away. It's easy to understand why I've not noticed this prior to the incident that happened over a week ago, as whenever I was with a large group, I wasn't me.. I mean, I was me, but I wasn't Jeremy. I was nestled within the protective environment of game (with The Cam), or too busy to notice it. But when there are almost three times as many people as I'm used to walking around in my work center, and I realize that I've been sitting on the countertop rocking back and forth slightly, moving whenever anyone moved into the small space I had found for myself, I came to understand this yet unobserved part of me.

Fun stuff, eh?

-=-=-

Blue Card

Finally got my blue card!!!! What does that mean, it means that I don't have Cinderella Liberty anymore when in Yokosuka. It means that even though I still tend to make it back to the ship before midnight, I have the option to be irresponsible and stay out even later... like til 1210 or something.. lol... Weeee...

-=-=-

Supernatural & Smallville

If you've not seen Supernatural yet and you enjoyed the first couple seasons of The X-Files... then you're missing out. You really gotta get your hands on Supernatural. I've watched the entire first season and now I'm upset... because of the fact that the second season isn't out yet...

I've also managed to finally get my hands on Season 5 of Smallville and finish watching that... and now I'm doubly upset... but not as upset as I am with the closer of Supernatural...that just pissed me off... but anywho I watched Smallville and I can't wait for season 6 to be finished so that I can get a hold of that one.

-=-=-

Movies....

Heard that one of you devout readers out there went and saw X-Men3... and agree with me that it stinks. I haven't seen past the closing credits yet, so I'm not sure what everyone keeps talking about with watching until the end of the closing credits... if someone wants to fill me in there, please do.

If you're a big fan of Mel Brooks, look around for The Mel Brooks Collection which is in stores now. Seven great Mel Brooks DVDs for under $100. Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety, History of the World Part 1, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, To Be or Not to Be, Silent Movie, The Twelve Chairs.

Also grabbed a copy of Silent Hill... Really wish they hadn't used the Silent Hill 2 ending, but otherwise was a good movie. I've been hearing gossip that they're thinking about releasing a Silent Hill 2 movie, and with four games out there for the Silent Hill series, that's not too surprising. Also hitting theatres soon.... Saw III.

Well, that's it for now, take care and have fun."

"event","So I've been over here in Japan trying to get a Chapter and then Domain up and running for almost 10 months now. Got Requiem venue going sometime in late Feb early March. 6-7 months down the line we've had our social & charity function, and have well over 10 people and well over 30 miles from the nearest Domain. This means Domain availablity according to the Membership Handbook (page 40, looked it up). Nope.

I was about ready to get some sleep when I decided to check my email, and now I can't get to sleep because of just how aggravated I am.. I mean, twitching aggravated.. Those who've dealt with me at twitchin' stage, know what I'm going through right now, and just how pissed off I am..

Just what happened to get me this pissed?? Simple. An email from the ACD Jenn Hutt..

Hi everyone, 
 
Having talked to Dawn, we wanted to set out the standards for being considered a Domain in GIR.
 
- At least 10 people
- More than 1 VSS (2 of one venue or multiple venues)
 
These are the bare bones of requirements.  Take a look at your group.  If you meet them and believe you are not listed as a Domain, please contact myself and Dawn.  If you are  listed as a Domain but do not meet these, you may also want to contact myself and Dawn. 
 
The details of this requirement, as well as the standard for Regions, will be released as part of the GIR Membership Handbook.
 
Thank you,

Wow.. I knew that they were making a new Membership Handbook for the GIR, since a lot of things that's going on here is really affected by some of the structures that they have set up in the Membership Handbook, but it was supposed to ASSIST and not OBSTRUCT. Now I know, though, why we've been waiting on pins & needles in regards to the status of our domain application that we put in earlier this month.

Those that haven't talked with me about my particular group, here's the reason why this is an impossibility..

1 - We're ALL US Navy that span MULTIPLE ships, and Dawn Llowd (aMST GIR) knows this for a fact.
2 - I have one aVST who's quasi-knowledgeable in Requiem & is also the CC
3 - There's no interest in any of the other venues.. I mean, none, zilch, nada, zero, zip
4 - We maybe play one actual game every month, otherwise it's sporatic downtime actions (in the form of a PBeM) and only when they're not busy with Navy things

Yet, they want to say that you have to have two VSS' in play in order to get Domain. Gawds, can't wait to get back to the states."

"event","Wow, a twofer...

But this one is an easily understood rant...

For those not aware... I'm forward deployed in Japan. This puts me in a country where you'd think that there wouldn't be all too many Cam people, unless you realized that military people loved playing in the Camarilla. But, for those that can't believe it, realize that there is two domains and one chapter located in Japan alone. So, we've got our own RST & RC... We're looking at getting a NST as well and also working on making adjustments for the Membership Handbook and Rule sets as they are adjusted for Canada, Australia, & the UK.

However, the real aggravation comes in at the fact that I'm a VST. Now, let me expand upon that. I'm the ONLY VST in the Tokyo area within the Indie Chapter (soon to be a Domain) here. This will mean that I'm probably going to be voted up to DST. Normally, people would see this as not being so much a bad thing as a good thing, right? Wrong.

The reason that it's a bad thing, is because we have a RST who is INCREDIBLY hard to reach unless you're a part of the Domain that's located up in Northern Japan. Even though we have the guy's phone number and multiple different eMail addresses. Which just means that when nominations come up that there will be more people apt to vote for someone else than the present one, or maybe even happen sooner if a VoNC gets called. This is where the problem comes in. I can't run for it...

Yeah, I'm a VST which means, by the rules set forth within the Camarilla, I cannot hold the position of a reporting authority above me (beyond DST). Yet, there is no one able to take over for me as Requiem VST, nor any interested people wanting to take over for me either (even though we have a couple of people who have finished the ST test & passed it), and even knowing this fact, I've been told by the players in my chapter that I should run for the position since I'd make a better RST (and God knows that I REALLY need to get a position in the upper eschelon now that I'm actually MC8). But they just merely pout now after I pointed out the rule.

"event","Okay... so here's an update that not many people have heard me talking about.

At the time that I'm writing this up in Notepad so that I can get it to LJ later (since I'm waiting for the wireless connection to work again), I'm sitting less than 10 feet from a beautiful woman. For those that don't know me, I'm actually picky about labeling women as beautiful. Here's the bonuses that she's got going for her (but this, in no way, implies that these are the only things that qualifies a woman as beautiful).

1. She's got red hair (BIG turn on.. yeah, I know I'm not unique with this one).
2. She's listening to Dennis Leary.
3. She's quoting Dennis Leary WHILE listening to him.
4. She's a gamer chic.
5. She's an online gamer chic.
6. She watches anime.
7. She watches anime in Japanese with English subtitles.
8. She watches romance anime (Chobits, Love Hina, Oh! My Goddess, Ai Yori Aoshi, etc).
9. She laughs.. not giggles (tee-hee-hee, shut the fuck up), but actually laughs.
10. She's got a button nose.
11. She's got alabaster skin.
12. She's wearing a black lace bra.

Okay, I actually tried taking a covert picture of her using my webcam to show who it is that I'm talking about, and knew that I thought she was beautiful after deleting the pciture at the personal complaint that it did no justice, even though it captured her staring at her laptop and laughing at Dennis Leary after quoting him while he was singing 'I'm an Asshole'.

Now, those who don't know me won't be able to figure out what's the purpose of this complaint, because that's just what this is... those that do know me will understand.

So, for those that don't have a clue, here's the rest of the story. As well as how I know she's wearing a black lace bra for those that don't understand that either.

-=-

So I've got this small, lil, teeny, tiny problem... It's called being girl shy. No, even that's not completely true, it's called being shy of beauty that I'm attracted to. Yeah, that's a better definition.

As long as I'm trying to hold a conversation with them in an indirect sort of way (as a third party), then there's no problem.. But if I try for something more than that, then I just totally clam up (or start muttering quietly) and turn lovely shades of red. So, here I am catching glimpses of a beautiful woman out of the corner of my eye so as not to make her uncomfortable, or God forbid, want to actually talk to me by asking me why I'm looking at her, and writing this up. Meanwhile, she's still quoting Dennis Leary & laughing at the comments that she & he make, as her top (a square low-cut blouse) shifts down periodically, giving a good glimpse of the black lace bra that she's wearing and the cleavage that is offered by it's wearing... I figure she's at least a C cup.

Sigh.... I hate being me sometimes."

"event","Wait... I'm updating this thing? *gasp*

Yes, I know.. I'm not as religious in updating this thing as I used to be, or near as religious in updating this thing as some other attention whores are *cough cough*<lj user=""satyr69"">*cough cough*, but at least it gets updated and that's more than I can say for some people who actually read this *cough cough*<lj user=""gypsie998"">*cough cough*

So, let's see... what to talk about.

Well, first off I'm gonna go ahead and get a quasi-rant off my chest, mostly as it seems that's one of the things that I do best when I write to my LJ.

Cleaning. Now, I'm not talking about everyday cleaning, I'm talking about ""relatives-coming-over-so-make-it-look-good"" cleaning. Exactly what is up with that? I mean, if I'm visiting someone, I don't need them running their kids ragged, or running around themselves, trying to clean the place up so that when I get there it looks emasculate. I'm telling you, if my brother has children and I decide to swing by, I'm going to make it a point not to announce my visit so that they don't go crazy with cleaning. Likewise, if I know some relatives/friends are coming over, I'm not going to go crazy in cleaning up either. People that have dealt with me in the past know that this is a cold, hard fact. I clean because I need to clean, not because someone's coming over.

Now, why bring this up when I'm living on a ship and not presently living in a house? Because Saturday is Friendship Day here in Japan where we have people come on base and walk through our ship while on tours. Because of this, we have to make sure that all of our spaces are ultra-clean and ready for them to be astonished. Frankly, I'm pretty sure that they realize that we just finished cleaning the place, and that there is NO WAY that our ship is normally this clean. But yet we go about cleaning every crook & nanny trying to make sure that we impress these visitors for the one day that they're going to be on the ship.

Another thing that I find humorous, is the fact that all three ships that I've been a part of now have beat into us that it's important that we pass Basic DC so that we can get all of our shipboard quals taken care of. This isn't a problem. Heck, on the Belleau Wood they sat you in a class for a week, and then had an open-book test. On the Vandegrift they left me in the room with the test book not more than five feet from me, open to the page that had the answers on it and informed me that they would be back in about half an hour and just to leave my test on the desk (next to the answer key) when I was finished. So, I'm starting to see some sort of trend here... Until I get to the Mustin. After a couple days of going over the necessary information and then having us study from a Basic DC book that had all the information, they passed out the test and had us do it wo/any help from books or notes. Definitely a change.

As I wasn't expecting the test, I ended up failing it. Several days later, I'm ready to take the test & find DC2 Mault so that I can have him hand me another copy of it. Five minutes later I'm only 10 questions in and he's looking over my shoulder telling me that the answer that I just selected was wrong. I knew what was coming... Sure enough, he takes the test from me, sits down and begins to ask the questions that I'd already gone over to make sure that I knew the answers. Once satisfied that I knew the first 12 questions (out of 50) he proceeded to read off the answers to the rest of the questions on the test and told me to let my LPO know that I passed the test with only missing 3 questions.

Now, I just gotta love a mandatory test that every command seems to decide they really don't care how it is that you passed it, just as long as you passed it.

-=-

On a different note, I've decided to actually go out and see the movies that are showing on base. Every Tuesday all movies are only $1. Otherwise, they're $3, so no big loss there since they're always first release movies. This week, it was The Omen on Tuesday and See No Evil on Friday. When I'm not so tired, I'll get around to writing reviews. Probably will be pretty soon since I'm forseeing me being stuck on the ship next week for a couple of days.

Cya on the flip side!"

Today I look at it again and am glad that I had a chance to participate in the game that I learned to call my own, even though I never officially was called VST for it. It's moments like these that I look forward to, and keep me within the Cam.

Thanks Char

<lj-cut text=""Hella Long... But that was DD"">The familar sound of a banjo and the hum of an harmonica are carried to you by the spirits.

An obnoxious Texan accent follows:

"" I am Rides-a-Wild-Pony of the Garou People, called Lunch Money to the Bone Gnawer Tribe and in the Sept of Thunderbird, called DD Williams to those of the human world. I am told that my moon was gibbious at my birth, though there are those who think otherwise.

And that's a'lright.

I come to you today to tell you of a cub who earned his name.

Now this young one weren't no oridinary cub. He weren't no child when the change came to him. He was a man. A man who had lived his life as a kin to the Shadowlords. Now, I don't mean no shame to Shadowlords, but Ya'll know how they treat their kin.

Nuff said.

And this cub lived all his life in service to the Nation, as the kin to ShadowLords do. And he done went and slayed hisself some banes, and some spirals to prove hisself to the Nation. And he's just a Kin, he ain't got no teeth, nor claws nor Rage. Just the good sense that Gaia gave him.

And that's a'lright.

And he done such a good job at this, they gave him a mate. And being the dutiful kin that he was, he did his job with the she-bitch and she got herself a belly full of pups.

Then Gaia looked down at this man-child and kissed his soul. That's right, she filled him full of Rage one night and made him a full member of the nation.

And his Shadowlord sponsers were none too fond a this change.

They had their selves a breeder, and he done went and changed on them. So they decides that he has to go and prove his worth all over again.

So they send him out off the baun and tell him to go kill some more Spirals and they'll think about giving him a Rite of accomplishment.

Now being brought up as he was, this cub didn't argue none, he just packed himself up and went and found some enemy and did what it is that we do. Killed hisself some Wyrm!

So he's done what they told him to and he comes back to the Sept, and being humble, cuz he's still not over being kin for 32 years, he asks the lead Shadowlord if what he did was acceptable. ( cuz it was the Shadowlord what sent him out of the sept on his quest to begin with)

And what do you think that black furred, slinky sneak said to him?

No.

And that's a'lright.

Cuz our boy's got hisself some determination. And he asks the Shadowlord what else he can do to prove his worth. And that sneakiest of sneaks looks at our boy and tells him,

""Go kill the bane that has infested our caren stone and we will give you your rite of accomplishment.""

Now, I don't know about you all, but if I let my Caern Stone get infested with Bane, I sure as hell wouldn't be sending in some cub to reclaim it. But they did.

They gave our boy a bag of sand and some arrows and a knife. Didn't tell him what to do with it, mind you, tossed him into the umbra and said:

""Go get it!""

And our boy used the gifts that Gaia gave him and the brain that Gaia blessed him with and he went and kicked some Wyrm ass....again. And he fell out of the umbra at the feet of that sneaky Shadowlord, all bleedin and oozin from his battle and asked if he what he had done was acceptable.

And that Shadowlord, who had managed to get named as Alpha while our boy was gone, grabbed him and shook him and said,

""No! You will never be anything more that a Cub until you can fight and beat me!"" and he attacked this cub.

Now, I know that what the Litany says about challenging an Alpha in a time of War, and apparently our cub knew what it said as well, cuz he took his licks and fought only to keep hisself alive. And he defended hisself while this sneakiest of sneaks took out his anger and frustration on this cub. Anger and frustration that this man-child kinfolk had the stones to be a changer after all.

And to top it all off, that slinky black demon told the galliards not to sing of the glory that this cub had earned so that he would be forced to remain a cub until HE deicided otherwise.

And that's a'lright.

Cuz our boy WAS a Shadowlord, and they are known for being able to think thier way out of a sticky situation or two.

So our boy left the sept. And he traveled north aways until he came to us. And being a Galliard, he told us his tale.

Now, the Alpha of the Thunderbird sept, he didn't like what he heard. And the Master of the Challenge, she didn't like what she heard niether. So they put their fuzzy heads together and tried to think their way out of this box. And they came up with a plan.

Ya see, the Glasswalkers of the Sept had gone and done something stupid and the spirits weren't talking to nobody. So the Master of the Challenge told our boy, figure out what's going on and help us find a way out of it and you will have proven yourself.

And our boy jumped right into it. He worked with the Theurges and he helped find out what they wanted. And then, when the price was named, our boy offered his own life to appease the Spirits so that the Nation would not be dishonored any longer.

No there's something that that sneaky Shadowlord Alpha seemed to forget, the Spirits are always watching us. And they keep thier own tab on our little game. And it don't matter none if the songs don't get sung, they still KNOW. (The songs just make it easier to spread the word).

So the Spirits didn't take our boy's life. Cuz he'd already given so much to appease them in the past and had already earned the Glory that was his due. But they accepted his offering so that the Thunderbird Sept could begin thier contrition.

And the Master of the Challenge patted him on the back and said,

""Congratulations.""

And the Alpha of Thunderbird Sept, Watcher-in-the-Darkness, an Adren of the First Tribe, placed his hands on the shoulders of this cub and named him

""He-who-slays-the-inner-demon"".

Now there might be some of ya'll who say that it was a cowardly thing for our boy to go to another sept for his Rite, but our boy IS a Shadowlord....and they are sneaky that way.

"event","And now that I'm back, I bring you something that some of you know me for.... A movie review... and that's not all... 
A rant to go along with it. As I feel this movie does not deserve not to be spoiled, I suggest that you not look behind to cut at the information that I'm about to tell you. The name of this horrendous movie??

Death of A Comic Book .... aka X-Men 3.

<lj-cut text=""You've Been Warned..."">So I've managed to see this movie, at least over half of it, without actually paying for it when a friend of mine downloaded the movie from the internet. I'm quite glad that I didn't see this at a movie, or even have someone with a DVD of it show it to me... This movie sooooo displeased me that I would have paid for the DVD just to take it out and destroy it.

Okay, for those of you who have NEVER read the comic book series or even seen the cartoons that were made for it back in the 90s, you still would be a bit distressed over the movie. I guess the director of it decided to just finish the series on the most disasterous film possible. I'm actually glad that they aren't making any more, too many fans would boycott it that there would be NO WAY that it could make enough money. I don't even know how Stan Lee managed to let this one slip by.

So here we go... What was so terrible about the movie that I couldn't stand it... In a review style format

X-Men brought you the directors belief on the origin of Rogue as well as Bobby (Ice Man) and Pyro... Really not all that delighted, but it was still a good X-Men type movie.

X-Men 2 brought you the directors belief on parts of Logan's past as well as Nightcrawler's introduction. The only real redeming part of the movie was that Nightcrawler went his seperate way and they didn't try throwing him in as a permanent character. Meanwhile, Bobby & Rogue are starting to develop a relationship that was never there in either the comic book or the cartoon series. Lady Deathstryke is also shown, in a very poor fashion and killed off way too easily. Also the mastermind behind the Hellfire Club was brought into the movie in a poor fashion and I'm glad that they didn't really expand more upon that than they did. The believed death of Jean Gray made things look up for the approach of X-Men 3 as the fans knew they were going to introduce Phoenix. Rumors started escalating that they were even going to show the Sentinels.

X-Men 3, just never deserved to be put to paper, it should have been torched, but then I have already made my opinion on that clear and you haven't even received your review. My apologies.

Like I said, I haven't seen all of it yet, and I really doubt that I ever will. However, here's a review on what I did see, feel free to add to it...

From the previews we were shown that the government had found a new mutant whose mutant ability was to remove the mutant ability from those that got near him. Then using his genetics, the government was able to create a ""cure"" to the mutant ""disease."" Many mutants had decided that this next step would prevent humans from harassing them, and flocked to centers where the cure was being handed out. We are shown that Jean Gray does, indeed, return in this movie, as well as the appearance of Angel & Beast.

Kelsey Graham was a good choice for Beast, his personality was definitely quite spot on from what I saw in the movie, however aside from the movements during the battle at the end of the movie, it just didn't sell as Beast. Angel... Well, I really didn't see him in what I saw, except near the end where he flies over the park, so I can't say whether the character potrayal was correct.

Bobby & Rogue continue their relationship, however with Rogue being unable to physically interact with Bobby, he starts to develop an interest in another female character, Kitty Pryde. So now you've got a love triangle that never really even comes close to happening anywhere... Why? I guess the director believed that it would pull the female audience in to put some drama into the already self-destructing movie.

Juggernaut is put on display as well... But when he's shown to the audience I'm sitting there trying to figure out who the guy from the Adult BDSM Store is supposed to be... Wait... that's fuckin' Juggernaut?!? OMFG!!

Jean Gray faces off against Professor X... Not too bad.. Until she does the same thing that she did to Scott... EXPLODES THE POOR BASTARD. That's right... Jean Gray has developed the psychic ability to make people explode into dozens of little pieces.. No blood or anything.. Uh-huh... So now she's offed Scott AND Professor X.. Wait, doesn't Professor X end up going crazy in the comic series and turn into Onslaught to tear the X-Men apart before they finally stop him??? Nope, guess he's dead now.

Calysto bows knee to Magneto as the Morlocks leave from the sewers of New York to organize up in the wilderness under the power of Magneto... Umm.. yeah.

Jean Gray decides to follow Magneto as well... Riiiiight, I guess if they got rid of the Hellfire Club, she can't be a part of that, so we'll just get the next best thing.

Bobby & Pyro have a kick ass fight, and they finally show Bobby the way he's supposed to be, covered completely in ice.

Jean Gray goes ballistic after they use the cure on Magneto and remove his powers from him for good, and destroys all mutant kind in the area (namely all the morlocks and some humans on the Alcatraz Island where they're holding the mutant kid who cures all). However, Logan, with his UBER regen power merely reforms his body parts that get destroyed after each blast from Jean & kills her himself.

Rogue goes and gets the cure given to her as is shown when she actually physically touches Bobby and tells him that everything is going to be right now.

And then right before the credits roll we are taken to a park where people sit around playing chess, and see a now saddened Magneto sitting at a bench with a chessboard in front of him, he gazes down at the board and reaches out his hand for a few seconds before the piece in front of him shakes a little...

Yeah... there's your review... For the death of a comic... If I see another X-Men movie launch from that director I'm gonna find me the next plane to Hollywood and tear him a new one.

Peace. I'll write again when I calm down from the viewing.</lj-cut>"

"event","Everything has been going rather well. We've set up the third chapter here in Japan and we're also the LARGEST one of the three, so we'll be approved for Domain here pretty soon. Oddly enough, we're also the only one that bothers to report on time as well... You'd think that we'd be hard to miss, right?

Well, I learned a couple days back that they're holding yet another regional Vampire game. This is great if you have access to Yahoo! messenger or chat programs. Unfortunately, all those of us on the ships don't have access to those things. Which means, 99.9% of the Chapter is unable to attend based on the fact that we don't have access to attend even though we really want to.

Now, this isn't the first regional game that they've held, and I doubt that it's gonna be the last. I've already informed our RST & aaMST as to the reason that my chapter is unable to attend, but never have heard anything back as to what happens at these events that might actually affect our chapter.

I'm also unsure if the nearby big-wig NPC is actually still in charge, since the RST hasn't bothered to send me any information on that either. Couple that with the fact that apparently there are all sorts of Global Vampire Plotkits out there that I haven't seen, and you're looking at one pissed off group of Cammies.

Basically, what it boils down to is a Troupe that is TRYING to play in the Global game and getting no Regional support. Yay us.... Fuckin' bastards."

<SMALL><B>He looks for psychological action along experimental rather than purely physical lines.</B> His character forever is full swing, he is continually out to achieve some objective; this is not the sit-quietly-by-yourself sign. Libra embodies his motto, ""We are"", and a relationship with him can feel like a duet or a danceathon that has gone too long. <B>A lot is going on in the mind of this man, and he's beaming with agendas.</B> Sex for him must be ""beautiful"". His vision of lovemaking is rather lyrical - no fumbling or false starts, but rather a slow, erotic journey with lots of crescendo, and a sweeping, successful finish that should never leave him or his partner wanting. <B>As a result, he may indulge in lavish foreplay, determined to gratify a woman early on if only as a preventive measure, daunted by the prospect of not delivering a big bang during intercourse. Fittingly, he is a ""light"", surfacey lover - orderly, yet improvisational. Kissing a woman's mouth, neck, ears, whatever; Libras expertly employ breath - sharp inhalations or hot blows - to awake hidden errongenous zones. He is a master of the soft touch, barely tracing his fingers over a woman's body, allowing her anticipation to play a part in arousal.</B> Libras are engineered for a tantric style of lovemaking. By taking a more yogic approach to sex - the erotic act with Libra can indeed be a transcendent experience. With the brain being by far the Scale's most powerful tool, sexually or otherwise, he may, in extreme cases, become so immersed in the erotic that it replaces any real, physical contact, intrigued as he is by no-fuss, no-muss hands off experiences. <B>Classy strippers, phone sex, autoeroticism, as well as elaborate mind games of domination and submission and voyeuristic fantasies are Libran domain.</B>

<SMALL>As one of the truly bisexual signs of the zodiac, he is especially paradoxical in his sexual attractions. <B>In brass tacks, Libra is prone to liking threesomes, of either the female-male-female or the male-female-male variety. Having a bisexual female partner is an especially thrilling possibility to the Libra, as the possibilities seem endless. As if Libra's paradoxical nature wasn't confusing enough, he's at once attracted to the straightest of men and the most ambigous of women. Of all gay men, Libra is perhaps the least naturally inclined toward steady relationships. His attraction to straight-acting, -appearing, and indeed -identified men finds him hooking up with the most barely bisexual characters - ""closet cases"" - with whom he shares a homoerotic, rather than strictly homosexual, approach to same-sex contact.</B> Libra can be quite the little male Lolita, precociously prevoking whatever submerged gay fantasy another man might possess. Like his straight counterpart, gay Libra likes to keep sex light and lively: Some of the many tops he attracts push his envelope a little further than he typically likes. <B>He is orally adept, though perhaps not especially talented in the deep-throating department.</B> Sixty-nine is standard sexual fare for the Scales guy, all things being equal. <B>A need for order and control prohibits Libra from ever being the consummate submissive. Instead, he might be described as an aggressive bottom.</B>

"event","I swear... this time they didn't even bother to tease you with the thought of getting vaseline put on it, they just rammed it right up there.

This is getting a completely new posting because of how insanely aggravating it is. It's far beyond insulting...

I've been waiting (along with everyone else on the ship that doesn't have duty) to get off the ship since... well really this morning, but after accepting that it was going to be awhile I was toying with the thought of getting off the ship since about 6p (almost 3 hours ago). However, after several long hours of doing absolutely nothing whatsoever, the CO finally came across the 1MC to let everyone know what was happening. We could tell by the tone of his voice that it wasn't going to be good. Here it is in ROUGH summarization.

""It's a team effort. We've been doing a good job of sticking it through, but there's a necessity for a cool-down period. We've already met 75% of the necessary evolutions, but we still need to have a cool-down period. So what I'm suggesting is that we... Well, we stay aboard for the rest of the night and not do a thing until tomorrow where we'll participate in drills so very enthusastically because we just love being where we're at. However, since we're going to be getting underway here pretty soon and working late nights until we do, I'm gonna let those people, to include myself"" No... seriously he used the words ""to include myself"" over the 1MC.. ""get off the ship to take care of business, but I want to make sure that everyone realizes that they need to be back by 0100.""

Bout this time our divisional officer called up to the shop and said (and I quote) ""IT3, just tell the guys to get off the ship and not worry about being back until 0100."" Yeah, that was music to everyone's ears when I told the guys in the shop about that, if they had a padlock door in front of them, they would have torn it off it's hinges with how quickly and eagerly they moved to get out of there.

So here I sit now... listening to my venting music while trying to find other ways to vent off all the frustration that I have... hrmmm... I  have to contact some of my Carthian PCs regarding a meeting that they're holding... I have an aggressive Carthian NPC that I've been waiting to release... mmmmm delicious timing."

It's 8.49a. On Sunday. I'm sitting in Radio. In working coveralls.

What's wrong with this picture?

I'll tell you what's wrong. Today's duty section is duty section 5, I'm duty section 3. Starting to see a problem yet?

Now, you're wondering why I'm sitting in Radio in working coveralls on a non-duty day, instead of .... oh, I don't know .... out and taking care of laundry, making sure that my working white uniform is ready for inspection tomorrow morning, surfing the internet for stuff that I can't surf while I'm at work, checking my off-ship email, etc. It's quite simple really, I was recalled while sleeping in my rack.

Apparently some <b>DUMB ASS</b> decided to get totally (and by totally, I mean world-encompassing) shitfaced while back home. Now for the fun equation on how that equals recalling everyone back to the ship.

Shitfaced + Vandalization + A&B of Japanese security + A&B of Navy security + Pissing & shitting in drunk tank = Ship-wide recall.

I have absolutely no idea as to how long we're going to be sitting here on the ship, but here I am. Don't plan on doing anything close to being considered work. I may have to be dressed in work clothes, but I'm not working... nor is anyone else that's a part of another duty section (general concensus from around the ship is we don't fucking care, we're not doing shit). Ahhhh... just gotta love life sometimes...

<B>UPDATE:</B> Well, I'm still stuck on the ship. I won't be getting off the ship until they get all the personnel records reviewed and any triggers found that would point towards a potential reoccurance. As for the guy?? Oh, he's gone. He's being dishonorably discharged and sent back home. I, however, am stuck on the ship waiting for someone to appear and say get the fuck off the ship. Maybe in about three or four hours time."

"event","So a couple weeks back (yeah, didn't update when it happened, but I've been busy, if you haven't noticed), I found out that I am qualified to play around with a new toy... Err, well I'm sure some people have objections to that term, but it's what I'm gonna call it since I hope I don't have to bother with it all that often..

We had a M-14 qualification sometime early last month, and needless to say I passed the qualification. I'm not sure how comfortable I am with that, especially since 80% of all my shots were to the abdomen area.. Yeah, he's alive but he's hating life..

Because of this, I'm now qualified to carry around this thing for five hours while making sure that no one tries anything. You know, there's nothing as boring as walking around the top of a ship by yourself with a M-14 strapped to your back.. Thus the entire toy ideal... After awhile I just started trying to think of things to keep from getting bored, which means that although I didn't break from my ""military manner"" or fool around with the gun, but my mind is so very good to run different situations. So, yeah, I hope that I don't have to worry about doing that watch again... but needless to say I got a new ribbon out of it."

Apparently my questioning of several individuals caused my binder to stop playing it's disappearing game. However, after looking through the collection I have while adjusting the travel binder I have, I noticed that one of my DVDs was missing... normally it'd be an easy enough fix by just buying the movie later on down the road, but it's the second disc in a 2 disc series (Dual! Parallel Dimension Adventure) which causes me to have to figure out who is responsible for it's disappearance.

"event","Well... had duty yesterday, and although I STILL haven't found the DVD binder full of my movies, I was kept amused by some of the players in my Requiem game. Nothing quite like watching a multiple-player DT play itself out, when it opens up with something like this:

-=-
Farnsworth receives a call from Masato Yamashita sending out an invite to his clube and to bring his finest flock of hoe's, he accepts and hangs up the hang. Farnsworth then shouts ""Ho's assemble"" the ladies must with Farnsworth quickly. He then looks at his flock of scantly clad ladies and picks four of the most beautifula nd faithful women. He then sends the other back to work. Farnsworth then turns to his four beauty queen whores and say's ""Y'all Ho's have been specially selected to entertain me and a couple of friends. So put yo sexist fly gear, and hurry the hell up."" The ladies quick scurry of the get dressed.
-=-

I kid you not. I saw the character sheet & noticed that the concept placed him as an undead pimp, but I guess I just skimmed over the Merits because I didn't realize he had the ""herd"" to back it up as well. It's moments like this that you just realize that this are going to be entertaining."

"event","Alrighty... I'm on duty today, so I figure that I'm gonna update the DVD folder that I take with me when I'm not at work since I haven't done that in almost a week. Unfortunately, when I go to where my large DVD binder is usually at, all I find is the smaller of the two binders that I have.

Well, I set that concern aside for the moment since I've got more important things to take care of (read as ""work""). Well, after work has been taken care of, I've also managed to cover most of the shop in the process and haven't seen a hair of my DVD binder... Now I'm starting to get actually concerned. I mean, this binder has over 100 DVDs in it, and not all of them are easily replaceable...

Well, duty is practically finished, and I've done a more intensive search for my missing DVD binder, still coming up empty, so I start asking co-workers if they've seen it at all. All of them come up baffled at the loss of it, since they knew that I kept it in the space and where it was put away.

Now, though... I've managed to talk to all but two or three of the guys in the shop, and none of them know where it's at. Hopefully the guys that I haven't spoken with already, know something... Otherwise I've just lost a binder full of DVDs... Shades of the Belleau Wood poking their head up here..."

2 New pieces of mail...

Some OOC stuff from Paul about the upcoming Domain meeting.. Doesn't affect me.
And a potential answer to a question I had regarding my addiction to City of Villains/Heroes... Yummy... looks like I'm going to have to start over with the ONE Hero character that I made so that I no longer have the problem I'm experiencing with the two games... Of course, it was an oversight of mine, but namely because they didn't bother to put instructions on how to properly install the second game if you've already got one installed.

"event","Yeah I know it's been quite awhile since I posted anything here, but I've been kept rather busy between school, work, studying for school and trying to get this new Chapter running here in Tokyo.. Not an easy process if I say so myself.

However, I only have two more tests to take at school, and two more days left in order to take the tests. So far, everything has been going wonderfully, no one has had to worry about retesting & I compliment the teacher on his ability to ensure that everyone in school retains the knowledge that he has been handing out.

In other news, I've found out that although Meebo is a wonderful tool that I can access from the work center, that they are no longer allowing it's use. Wonderful. Yeah, apparently the the guy that monitors all internet traffic for the ship actually does his job & monitors, unlike the guys that were assigned to do the same thing over on my last command. Well, they did their job, it's just that they didn't bust anyone if they weren't looking at anything pornographic or anti-military. Here, though, they crack down on basically everything. Yeah, imagine that, if it's not work related, we can't enjoy it... Dammit, what's this world coming to when no one can slack off at their job?

Also following on those same lines, I'm actually glad now that I'm not able to be off the ship past Midnight. I'm not too sure what all you guys may or may not have heard about what's going on over here with the military (since they have published some of this stuff in the newspapers for the military), but I can tell you that ever since the Kittyhawk has returned to the base, things have been going rather downhill.

There's no real specifics that I can actually mention, but there has been a murder, at least one raping, middleschool break-in... Yeah, you get the picture. Because of all of this, the base has developed a curfew, for everyone that's attached to the base. Basically no one is capable of drinking alcohol past 11p on Sun-Thurs and past 1a on Fri & Sat. No, that doesn't mean that they just stop serving alcohol, you aren't supposed to be drinking past those hours (unless you're back in your own home where no one can see you). You are also not able to be out and about past 1a on Sun-Thurs or 2a Fri & Sat (even though in one nearby city there is always at least one bar open somewhere all day through, you just need to bar hop). Needless to say, this is pissing several people off. But not us White Card holders... We're unaffected since we have to be back to the ship by Midnight anyway.

Contining on to matters of leave.... Yeah, so I found out that the entire hull-swap thing won't be happening until the June/July time period. This meaning??? Well, I guess I can take leave any time before that time period as long as I get approval from my CoC. Good news is, that I doubt it's going to be a problem, and after taking a look at airfare rates though one place (I still have to head over to our travel people here on base & talk with them), it isn't looking all that terribly costly. So with thumbs crossed, I'll be able to head out and enjoy some time back home with friends & family. No set time yet on when that might be, I'll keep you guys posted.

Seems like my friends list is also slowly growing with more of my Cam friends coming to realize that I'm actually out here. If you know someone that has a LJ and doesn't know about me yet... Send them my information. I'm always happy to see someone else climb on the bandwagon.

Lastly.... About the local game. I've already let you guys know that I'm going to be the one responsible for the entire Requiem deal that's going on here. Well, after a brief moment of discovery and contemplation in just shutting down, followed by a revelation just as I was about to slip off to sleep (isn't that always when those things happen), I am back to enjoying Cam life again. Now.. For those not aware, I finally came to understand why Requiem just doesn't flow for me. It's due to the complete lack of Masquerade within it. Kinda like how Wade was having problems with Forsaken due to the decided lack of Apocalypse. But just as Wade finally was able to find his nitch, so to have I. If I can't get the Masquerade from Requiem, I make the Requiem a part of the Masquerade.

Until such time that the characters take over the plot themselves and make me merely the guy that says action and every now & then throws in a plot twist for them to jump at like sharks to chum, I'm doing what I've been missing... Masquerade.

Oh, I'm not going to be changing the laws and concepts that have been set by the Requiem gods, but I will be using aspects of Masquerade to allow me to be comfortable with what I'm presenting them with. For example:

Carthians.. Yes, it's been decided that they're not Anarchs, & this I agree upon. However, I also realize that within every faction (Whether in this world or make-believe) there are extremists. Because of such, and a decided lack of Carthian material so far, I'm spawning extremist Carthians that would make any Anarch proud. Granted, they are a very very small group in comparison to the larger number, but they still exist.

Unaligned.. Let's just say that I've been writing up a plotkit for them that will make my players shudder.

There are other things, but this is not the place to send that information out... Who knows, one of my players may actually be reading this thing and then they'll know all sorts of juicy stuff that they aren't supposed to. But this particular game is going to be more Masquerade than Requiem.

That's all so thanks for reading."

Yep. Today marks the first day in a series of WEEKS that I'll be off to school. Now, on my last ship if you were TAD to a school in the area, you still didn't come in to duty on your duty days... However, every ship does things differently, and these guys say that on your duty days after you get finished with school you have to show up in the shop and finish off the rest of your duty.

Normally, my duty is a nice 24hr ""Sit-Up-In-the-Shop"" shift, which I'm gonna have to change since I have to be awake for school the next morning, and I sincerely doubt that they're going to want me to start slipping into slumber while trying to listen to the instructor just because I was on duty. If it's because I decided to stay up late to mess around on my computer or something else like that, that's a different story, but I don't intend on doing that so don't be saying anything of the sort.

Oh well... Off to school and time to see just how tricky this GCCS stuff is. No time to really explain it here, but feel free to search for it online and see for yourself."

"event","Well, everything was actually starting to go soooo smoothly in regards to the venue that we were starting up here in Japan. Unfortunately, it seems that the two pre-existing Domains (one way up north, the other way down south) had decided to create NPCs that filled the territory between their two domains and actually was the hierarchy for Japan.

So, after speaking with the ARST Requiem for Japan, I've found out that everything that me and one of the up-and-coming chapter members were talking about doing for the chapter is getting tossed out the proverbial window since there's no way that we can actually apply it with the existing hierarchy.

What does this mean?? It means relocating the game back to Tokyo from the decided move to Kyoto, and it means retaining a quite powerful NPC next door to the city that we're going to be playing in.

If there's one thing that I've always tried to establish for the players, is a power that is just slightly more powerful than the players that are going to have to deal with it. As it stands right now, I'm going to be the only one that's going to be able to deal with the NPCs with characters that I create. There's no good way to remove the NPCs from power to place PCs in the seat once the players become comfortable, and I really don't like having NPCs as a ruling party for the game; and I could have sworn that the Cam was also wanting to stay away from that as well.

Sigh... Oh well."

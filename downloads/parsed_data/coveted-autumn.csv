"event","I know it has been a while since I have last posted, maybe I should have posted sooner, but oh well, I couldn't.  I have had more important matters to deal with... such as my relationship with Kassi.  Right now it is on the rocks again.  We went through one breakup, and I fear that another is on the horizon.  I will admit that I was very stupid and called the first one... but I will not be the one to call one again.  It was too painful then, and I know that it will be even moreso now.  Hell, a break... that is the other option that seems to be looming on the horizon (which I fear just as much)... would be too much for me right now.  I don't have any idea what to do, and I know only that I love her and want to make her happy.

She says that she feels like she is being strangled... which hurts, but I am willing to bare anything to have her not feel that way... and so she wants to call a break so that she can put her life together and not be constantly focused on me.  I want to talk more about it tomorrow (9-22) but she is working closing so I don't see that happening.  And through it all she still wants me to come to her Homecomming no matter what.  To top it all off, on the way home I heard the song ""She Thinks She Needs Me"" by (i believe) Gary Allen.  I tried to hold back the tears because I am not one to cry in public, but I couldn't help it.  I was bawling the whole way home, then some, and I am on the verge of doing so again.  If I start this time I shall just cry myself to sleep.

I told her that no matter what I would make it to her Homecomming... even if that meant spending the night in the woods behind her house... then she said that she would break up with me before seeing me sleep outside like the dogs.  I made the mistake of saying that ""In that case I guess we are already broken up because I have already thought about it.""  That was a big mistake because I was just trying to say it to get her attention and to tell her that I would do anything for her.  I told her something that I have kept to myself from the start of it... that I didn't plan on telling anyone... and that was that I am turning my back on my family for her... that includes my Dad whom I love dearly and hate doing it to... because it is they who have forced me to be the way I am, and it is they who are causing this strain on the relatoinship.  I asked her what more she could ask of me... she said she wasn't even asking me to do that... and I told her that I know because I was doing it anyway because of the fact that they are trying to keep me and her apart.  I promised her that I would make it to her Homecomming no matter what, and that is a promise that I am not going to break.  I am tired of being forced to break promises to her, and I am tired of letting her down.  I know full well the comsequences of going to see her without my parents permission, or against their instruction, but I am going to do it anyway.  I know that I can be kicked out of my house for it, but it is a consequense that I am fully aware of and ready to accept.  Hell, I hate to do it, but I am bumming a ride there if need be, and trying to borrow money to send her roses.  Two things that I do not do if at all humanly possible.  And that also excludes intentionally and directly going against something my Dad has said.  I am ready to accept the full weight of the consequenses of doing this, and she doesn't seem to see that I would do anything for her.  I know that probably makes me crazy or stupid, or both for staying with her, but gods help me, I love her more than anything.

There is nothing that I wouldn't do for this girl, this woman, and she knows it.  I love her with everything that I am and I know that it cannot be fake because I have no feelings for anyone else.  In past relationships I had feelings for other girls, but I chose one over the others knowing that I still had feelings, and not knowing wheter or not the feelings would linger.  The feelings would always linger except with her.  She is the one for me.  I know it with every part of my existance on this small rock we call home.  I know that she is the one I want to marry and spend the rest of my life with.  Cheating on her has never even come close to being a slight neural impulse to cross my mind.  I know it will not.  I know that as soon as I leave my house I can return to who I really am, and not be worried about the future.  I will be, but I will not be consumed by it as I am now.  The only reason I am now is because I don't want to see us split, and I would die if I were to see us split.  Knowing how she feels now is kiling me inside because I don't want her to have to feel that way.  I want her to have nothing but happiness.  With or without me.  This is the longest relationship I have been in, and it is the only one I have been totally committed to making work.  I don't know how many times I have passed up hanging out with friends to talk to her... and she doesn't even know.

I want so badly to hate her for causing me to cry in front of one of my friends who I prefer not to cry in front of, but I can't.  All I can do is remember all the good times we had, smile about that, then be suddenly snapped back to reality to shed more tears.  Some would say that she isn't worth the tears I shed for her, but I disagree.  She is worth everything I give her any more.  Maybe she is right... maybe I am different... but I love her, and she is too good to me.  And all I can do is try to give her some happiness back.  She has given me so much joy, and all that I can see that I have given her is heartache, and pain that I don't want her to have.  Maybe I am not worthy of her love, she has done so much to lift me up, and all I do is bring her down.  I feel like death is the only suitable thing for me.  I try, and fail.  Promise, and let down.  I am the world's most horrible boyfriend/fiancee, or maybe not even that anymore.  I am not even worthy to be the dirt on which she walks.  But for some reason she loves me, and I know for a fact that I love her and I will do anything that I can for her and to ensure that she is happy.  If we are still together, we will be celebrating our 9 month in 9 days.  If not, then it would be that...  Kassi, I know you are out there somewhere, and I only hope that you can hear me when I say that I love you.

With that, this unworthy soul shall retire for the night, and will be back whenever."

"event","Too much has been going on, and I don't know where to start... hmm...

Well, one of the most important things is that me and Kassi have recently (July 1) celebrated our six month anniversary.  That was very nice, though we didn't get to really celebrate until the fourth.  The details I shall leave out for the most part because those are things that Kassi and I shall keep to ourselves.  I will just say that the fireworks were spectacular.  Those who know how I think may be able to pick up on what I mean... ok ok, I will tell.  There were the bottle rocket kinds, and the cannonball kinds, and all sorts.  We are approaching our seven month soon, and I hope things go as well if not better than they have been for the past six.  I have been happier with her than anyone else, and I don't intend to be happy with anyone else because she is perfect.  I will be the first to admit that our relationship isn't perfect, but I love it that way and so does she because it gives us more reason to stay together (like we need more of a reason than the fact that we love each other...) because we have something to work for.  I have never desired a perfect relationship... in a perfect relatoinship there is nothing to work at and work for.  There is nothing for the couple to overcome and grow stronger as a couple by overcoming said obstacle... a mouthfull I know, but it makes sense if you read over it a few times...  Our relationship is also far from normal... which I love.  That makes it interesting, and there is never a dull moment... atleast not for me and I pray not for her.  (Yes, I know that I have a tendancy to be a doating boyfriend, but if you had her or someone like her you would be too.)

Other things that have happened:


Before that on the 20th of May I graduated from Pheonix and I have been accepted into Perimeter (a college near me).

Adam has left for YCA, I am going to miss him... that squirlly son of a bitch...

Josh has left for YCA too... he is another one I am going to miss...  you have to come back on leave Chewy!  *mumbles* of doom! *mumbles*

Happy Birthday Devon!!!  ...even though I know that you won't ever read this probably, I know it is late, but I am bored today.

Same to you Shadow... though I am quite a bit later with yours... ""THEY BURNED ANOTHER ONE!!!""  I hope everything works out extremely well for you.  You deserve it.  You have been through enough shit in your life already.

I have a part in a movie... not going to say much about it yet so that Chris can put it out before anyone else can.  It is a fun movie though... and i die!!! YAY!!!  Another kool thing about the movie is that me and Kassi are going to be working on it together... hehe I got her the part of a woman giving birth...  She wasn't too happy to take the part, and I am trying to tell her that it will be good practice for when we have kids of our own... ""It's like pushing an eight-pound bowling ball out from between your legs!!"" -Kassi

Chris, I have to hand it to you, you have come a long way in making movies.  This should be super kick ass... and that was probably the gayest phrase I have ever used.  Oh well, I shan't edit it for the benefit of humor, and because it is more natural to do it the way I am."

"event","I am not in the greatest of moods right now.  I had to tell Kassi some news that I wasn't too happy or excited to tell her.  I have never really been partial to cancelling with her, and I had to do that a FUCKING FOURTH TIME!  There is nothing worse for me than to have to tell her things like that.  Especially when everything was going so perfectly.  The car died, we fixed it... or so we thought.  We replaced the battery, and it was running fine last night and today until on the way home from church.  Then it decides ""Oh, let's fuck things up and die again!  That sounds like a good idea to me!  I am my mother's car, so I should act like her and be a pain in the ass!""  I tell my dad that Daryl and I will go out, buy an alternator, and put it in and bring the car home... he fucking tells me to fuck off (in less words).  I was going to fucking pay for it!  Even if that wasn't the problem!  I WAS GOING TO FUCKING PAY TO HAVE THE DAMN CAR FIXED TONIGHT!!!  I don't see how I can fucking be selfish if I didn't want any monetary reembersement for it.  All I asked was to see my girlfriend, the love of my life, the one who I plan to marry... provided that she will still have me that long now.  I just wanted to see Kassi tomorrow.  I didn't think that that was so wrong, but aparently it is.  Aparently I am not allowed to love anyone other than family members, and if I am, I am obviously not allowed to love someone an hour and a half away.  THEY CAN FUCK OFF!!!  I CAN'T DECIDE WHO MY HEART LOVES, AND EVEN IF I COULD I WOULDN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT I LOVE HER.  I am tired if this bullshit that they are pulling.  ('They' being my parents.)  I need my fucking liscense so I can tell them to go jump off a fucking bridge, and I will have a car and they won't be able to fucking tell me that I can't go see her, or pick her up for my game.  I mean for crying out loud, I don't get to see her that often in the first place!  Then they tell me that we can plan for a day that they cancell on the day before.  I FUCKING PROVIDED THE MONEY FOR THE SOLUTION, AND THE LABOR TOO!!!  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE!!!  I feel like dieing for having to do that to her.  Right now she is probably the only one out of the two of us who has any faith in me.  I feel like I have failed her.  I feel as thought there is something that I could have done that I couldn't see to do that I should have.  And now I don't know when I will talk to her next.  She told me that she would call me when she was ready to talk, I don't know when that will be.  I pray that it isn't during my ball game.  I just hope that it is soon.  I can't stand the thought of not being able to tell her goodnight every night.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I am tired of haveing to do this to her, I am tired of not being able to be there for her when she needs me, I am just tired of hurting her, and not bringing her happiness.  I love her beyond belief, and I want to do what's best for her, and I don't know what the best is anymore.  I want to say that it is staying with me, but I don't know.  It seems that all I am capable of doing now is failing her which is bringing her hurt.

I LOVE YOU KASSI!!!!
I MISS YOU!!!
I AM SORRY!!!"

"event","Hey Y'all.  I am in one of those kinda giddy moods that occour with a great deal of sleep loss.  Don't ask how it happened, long story.  I have not much to say other than I LOVE YOU KASSI!!! and to tell people that I still exist, and I am still dead to the world!  I am completely alive to my g/f/fiancee... I don't exactly know...  Kinda hard not to know, I know, but it is an interesting situation... if anyone can clarify for me, it would be much appriciated.  

Here it is:

Friday, I told my g/f (Kassi) that I would ask her to marry me, but I didn't have a ring.  She cut me off about the time that I was saying that I didn't have a ring with a yes and a kiss.

Oh, some background would be nice for you too:

We have been planning our wedding for months now.  We have the year and month set.  We know where we want it.  Whe know what time of day we want it.  We have planned out our life together i.e. how many kids, kids names (forgive me Kassi, but I kinda forgot them because we tossed around so many, but then the names are also liable to change when we see the kid), where we are going to live, and so on... we know we are going to marry each other.


Well, I have to head off to bed, so if anyone has any ideas, let me know... I know I still have to ""officially"" proposee to her (for myself if no one else).

Later all.  I LOVE YOU KASSI!"

"event","Well, friday went really well.  I held up alright, and I had fun.  I can't wait to see Kassi again.  I talked to her dad about her coming to see my game on the 25th, and he doesn't have a problem with it, so I am excited.  We did all kinds of fun stuff, like a few walks, sitting and talking... lots of stuff.  One of the walks was around the block, and the other was in the woods.  We almost didn't get home... and I wouldn't have had a problem with that.

This whole relationship is really hard though.  Not in the sense that it is hard hard, just in the sense that I actually have someone that I know I can tell absolutely anything to, and they honestly care and want to help.  I am used to being able to only rely on myself... that is what makes it difficult.  I am used to walking alone.

Well, I'm off to bed.

I LOVE YOU KASSI!!!"

"event","Day... realatively uneventful.  Had to clean mostly... that and write an essay.  I did talk to my Baby, and I went bowling with Darly, but that is pretty much it.  I am trying to save out relationship because she seems to be slipping away from me which breaks my heart that I could ever do something that would cause that, but I am trying to save it.  She told me the biggest thing that I could do to save it was to not be perfect for her and to keep all my flaws... that will be hard to do because I am and always have been trying to perfect myself... Oh well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to not be such a perfectionist because I do love her and all.

Speaking of Kassi (my Baby for those who haven't figured that out yet), I GET TO GO SEE HER FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love that girl with everything I am... you know, people keep trying to define what love is and it really annoys me.  Love cannot be defined.  It is a feeling.  A knowing that cannot be expressed through words.  Any sublime feeling that cannot be expressed through words, that is why the word 'love' was created.  Another thing that irritates the hell out of me is people trying to tell me that I am too young to love, that I can't possibly know what love is... BULLSHIT!!! There is not a certain age that you have to be to know love, and there isn't a specific way to know that you're in love or that you love someone.  Hell, you could love someone when you're four years old!  It is true, love knows no bounds, so don't hand me this bullshit that I can't know or that I am wrong or that I don't know.  I know.  I can't say how I know other than I know.  You can't be uncertain about whether or not you love someone.  If it is love, you know it is.  If it isn't then you know it isn't.  When you love someone, you know.  Something from somewhere tells you that it is love, and cannot be anything else.  I know love because I have never said ""I love you"" to anyone other than Kassi in the manner that I mean it to Kassi.  As far as girlfriend/boyfriend relationships are concerned, I haven't said it to anyone other than her.  Reason being, is that I haven't felt right saying it to anyone until her.

I know, I know, all of you are probably getting irritated with this mushy stuff by this point.  I don't really have much not mushy stuff to say right now because things really haven't been all that eventful.  Yeah, I'm on spring break, but I have to clean the whole time, so I doubt that things will be any more eventful.  And the whole thing about love, it is just a passion of mine because there are so many people in the world who just don't have the guts (or are actually that ignorant) to follow their heart and they judge people the way that they feel because of a mistake(s) they have made as far as relationships go.

Well, it's late, and I am supposed to be in bed with my Baby, so I will talk to you all later.  Night all.  I love you Kassi."

Well, my mom broke the antenna off of my phone... I just finished Ghetto-rigging it: aluminum foil wrapped in masking tape!!! HELL YEAH!!! I don't really give a flying fuck cause it is working right nice now.  I am not too concerned about the parental leashe that it provides, I am more concerned about the leashe that it provides for Kassi... God I love that girl, and all of you should too.  She is wonderful and more than I could ever hope for.

Hmm... what else?  OH YEAH!!! HOW COULD I FORGET??? DEVON IS ENGAGED!!! HAHA!! I'm sorry dude.  Kiddin, I am happy for ya.  I will be soon to follow as soon as I can get a ring... and see my Baby of course.

I LOVE YOU KASSI!!! CALL ME BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WANT TO!!!  YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT! YOUR BITCH IS TELLING YOU TO CALL HIM!!! LOL! I love you Babe, and I'll never stop.

I know he is a busy man, but jeeze, he said he would coach... ok, I think I understand things now, he is in charge and I do all of the dirty work like one of his little minions... anywho, things have been hectic.

Also, some people that would be in my shoes at this point in time would say ""Fuck it, she's not worth it."" Well, I can't say that, I love her truly, and I will not abandon her.  I won't abandon the hope that we will be together later.  She means too much to me.  I would pay any price to see her happy... and I do mean ANY.  Never have I met anyone like her, nor will I.  I have never felt this way about anyone before.  I can't really explain why, but I know that I love her and that she is the one.  She is wonderful, beautiful, and everything she says she isn't.

I can't even say that it is worth putting up with because I love her, no, I don't put up with it because I see nothing to ""put up"" with.  I love her, and that is that.  I will marry her, or I will marry no one.

"event","Well, I think the shit has definately hit the fan.  Too much is happening that I cannot control, and too much for me to deal with.  Granted, this too much partains to one and only one thing, but it is more than just one thing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I love her, and she says she loves me
She wants to make sure that WE are true
I know we are true, and I believe it
The undertone in her voice tells me it is so

But there seems to be more than I thought
Something that I musn't be doing right
For if I were doing everything perfectly,
Then why, tonight, would I be crying

""Other people"" is what she says
""No one lined up"" again she speaks
I am not there to know the truth
But I trust that she tells me no lies

I can see no one else
Not if I wanted to, not if I try
My heart, though broken now, is hers still
My love is part of it and will always be

Until the end of my life on this planet called earth
Would I wait for her, my one and only love
I can't stop, I won't stop, not if my life depended on it
For I would betray my fidelity and love for her were I to stop

If my words make her melt,
Then why am I crying
If she loves me,
What is there to be sure of

Tears are falling tonight
Because I love her
Tears are falling
Because I miss her

Emptiness is upon me
Because I feel that she is no longer mine
All because I love her
Emptiness is upon me tonight

I knew going into this
That this would happen
I saw it all in a vision of mine
I saw it so clearly, but it is not through

I knew she would break my heart in this way
The girl of my dreams and the love of my life
But the rest is yet to be proven
The part when she comes back

Sounds like a movie, this I know
But a movie it is not
For this is life, not film or heaven
No, it is not film, for only life could life be so cruel

I know she is the one for me
Because it is with her
That this vision of mine is fufilled
So I opened myself to this, knowing full well what would happen

Since I opened myself this way
Why am I crying tonight
Since I opened myself to this vision
What do I fear

I fear life and its cruelty
I know I love her
Because it feels right to say it to her
That is why I cry

I never deserved the heaven I had
She seemed to good to be true
No, it is not her fault she left me
It is mine and I know what I have to do

I know heaven is not what I deserve
Hell is the designated place for eternity
But in the time that I have left
On this lonely rock, I must do what I know I must

Follow her is what I have to do
Because that is what I do in my vision
I will not follow her because that is what is ""written"", no
I follow her because I can have no one else

But through everything I know to be right and true
There is one thing that I must seek above my own desires
That is to make sure she is happy
To see that carried out through any means possible

No matter what harm or heartbreak may come upon me
She is my greatest and foremost concern
When she is happy, then I can be happy
No matter if it is or is not with me

I want the best for her
And I haven't been in a position
Where I can give her the best
So until I can, I have to be strong

I must be a man about all of this
Despite my tears and sorrow I have but one duty to preform
I know that since I love her, I have to see that she is happy
I love her enough to let her go if that is what she wants

Right now she wants that
And that is what she'll get
She must be happy though
Or I will not stand fot the thought

Through thick and thin
I will always be there
Never desertign her
Not turning my back

However she needs me
Friend, Boyfriend or Husband
I am there in a heartbeat
For her sake and for her happiness

I cannot leave this world
And take the chance that she will be hurt
I can't trust anyone here
She means too much to me to completely let go

I can't trust anyone in any way
Because I don't want her to have a broken heart
I can't let anyone do that to her
She can't have it happen again

She says she is heart broken
I feel it is my own fault
If I could have only been there
For her just once, this might not be

But it is, and I am lost
She was my guiding light
She was the only one able to keep me alive
When I felt like dieng, and giving it all away

I was at the brink, lost and confused
She gave me direction
I know that she is the one for me
But I cannot be greedy

Through all my barriers
Through everything that I have done
I prevented things making me cry
But tonight, the tears will flow

A dam has burst in my soul
I have lost control of my emotions now
No anger, nor agression of any sort
Only saddness and loss

The two emotions that I had the most control over
The two that no one could make me feel
She has done it with only a few words
And I do not care that it was her

I want her back terribly
But I cannot cage her
A caged bird never sings
I cannot keep her beauty for myself if she wishes me not to

I have lost this battle
And I fear losing the war
I cannot nor will I try to control her
Her will is her own, like her heart and her love

I just want to hide
And not see anyone
To mourn a loss that is to terrible to imagine
It is worse than death

To have your heart mended
Then torn asunder as mine has
They say it is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all
Well ""they"" have never loved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good night folks, I cannot take any more of this.  I will go weep because of what I did wrong.  Weep because I broke her heart.  Weep because she is gone.

I LOVE YOU KASSI!!! I ALWAY WILL!!! I AM WAITING FOR YOU WITH OPEN ARMS WHEN YOU WILL HAVE ME BACK!!!"

"event","For reasons that shall remain unknown... except to those who are involved, I have attained a new theme song for the time being.  It is entitled ""Tears In Heaven"".

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven

I must be strong
And carry on
Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven

I'll find my way
Through night and day
Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you beggin' please... beggin' please...

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven

I must be strong
And carry on
Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven
    -Eric Clapton

This song was written by him after the death of his son, but if looked at properly, it can fit my situation just fine.  Don't get me wrong people, I am fine, it's just my theme song for now."

"event","I know that I have failed to update in a couple days, but time has not really provided for that luxury.  School mostly.  The other is the rents.  I can't really update at the beginning of the day because nothing has really happened.  By the end of the day, stuff has happened.

The day started off pretty normal, and then started to decline in pleasurable results as it wore on.  At McDonald's I found out that a friend of mine wasn't going to be here for a while.  That was kind of understandable under the circumstances.  Then my Baby called me :)  I was happy to hear her, but she was sick.  That wasn't good to hear.  Then there were 2 wrecks withing an hour today... people need to learn how to drive...

After that, the day went pretty much normally until lunch.  That is whin I found out that one of my friend's dad was trying to screw up a good relationship.  That pissed me and Devon off.  Then the day went pretty much normal with the exception that Devon spent the better part of 3rd period with me.

From there, I found out that I may not be able to see Kassi this saturday.  That really pissed me off, then I talked to my dad and I will probably be able to see her sunday if not saturday.

That is really about all that is new though.

Kassi: I love you!!! There is nothing to be scared of, and I will be there for you always.  I will also be there with you in one way or another always.  I LOVE YOU!!! I MISS YOU!!!  Now shut up and come kiss me!"

"event","Normally I do not double post with anything, but I guess this is a special occasion if you could call it that.  I have a few things to say that may or may not necessarily need to be said.

One thing that needs to be said is that I am not really in the best of moods because I don't have (in my opinion) sufficient funds to get Kassi a birthday present, and I have started the ""Drew needs money to get Kassi a Birthday Present Fund"".  If you wish to contribute, let me know via email, and I will provide sufficient information on how to contribute.  The fund is short-term for the moment, but may be revived depending on the future.

Another thing that I was remiss in saying earlier is very crucial, and I don't fell too good about the fact that I forgot to mention it.  The fact is, today is mine and Kassi's Anniversary.  Happy Anniversary Babe.  You mean the world to me.  You definitely get the ""Best Girlfriend"" award.  You I would gladly give my life for you.  I can't wait to marry you. The day will not come soon enough.

Now I know all you guys out there are going to feel like chastising me about the above section about my anniversary... that is fine, but for all I'm concerned, you can bite me.  I do love her, and everything I said there and more is true.  I will not change what I wish to say about her just to prevent ridicule.  I don't care.  You should know me well enough that I lay things out as they are.  So either you take it the way it is, or oh well.  I don't care what you think about me because of it.

I think that is about it... in my personal opinion, I would have to say that my Anniversary is the most important part of the day.  Now I am gone for good... in the immortal words of the Terminator ""I'll Be Back"" and also in the words of the immortal Jed Clampet ""Y'all Come Back Now, Y'hear."" there is more to come after the break.

I love you Kassi, always have, always will."

"event","Not much has happened, yesterday was spent getting the tires on the car replaced, today was just another boring day at school... the countdown to when I see Kassi is still on...5 days.  I wish it were now, but it can't be unfortunately.  I need cash so that I can geet her something nice for her birthday... yeah, that's pretty much it.  Boring as hell is pretty much what it boils down to.

I LOVE YOU KASSI!!!"

"event","Not much has happened as of late.  Long day of cleaning... blah... and the computer room was messy.  I cannot figure out why the blame always falls upon the shoulders of the innocent.  It is just dumb luck I suppose.

Kassi: I love you more than words can say.  You have mended a heart that was once broken.  I know you won't break it, for I know you love me.  Can't wait to get my hands on you.

Jason: Halo was fun, we need to do it again.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tears fall from your eyes
As autumn leaves in a windstorm
The leaves are caught by the ground
But I cannot catch your tears

Renounce the sorrow within
Rejoice in your love oh beautiful child
The reaper has not yet come
The reaper is held at bay

Live in merriment
Death has taken a day off
For I have bartered with death
So that you may live
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not finished yet, but it is there...

Yeah, I am off to do bigger and better things... I think sleep may be on the agenda somewhere, but who knows, the sun is yet to kiss the sky."

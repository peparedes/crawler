Welcome all!"

"event","Ginny, Ron and Hermione arrived home this morning. Molly and I went to London and picked them up. Unfortunately, Ginny's still too young to apparate, so we had to make do with Public Transport and then a type of Muggle car they call a cag. Or maybe it's a cad? I'm not entirely sure, but at least it got us to where we needed to be - and that was home!

Fred and George should arrive tomorrow sometime, they'll be over for dinner every now and again in the next week or so, but they still have the shop to attend to. At least they're taking Christmas day off. Bill and Fleur are going to arrive at about midday, after visiting the in-laws I suppose, and Charlie's already here. As for Percy, well, same I suppose. At least most of the family is together on Christmas. We're not going to let anything spoil it, for Molly's sake at least.

Tonk, Remus, Sirius and Harry are all coming. Well, Harry probably, we're still not sure. And Sirius has asked to bring a guest. I'm not too sure what to make of that, but so long as he's human. Brody, I think his name is. 

I finally did all my Christmas shopping. Molly has outdone herself this year with the jumpers. Even Sirius, Tonks and Remus have got one. I might say, I find Tonks' jumper to be rather amusing. But less on that, I've got to go now. Something about a bed that needs fixing before anyone else gets here."

"event","Sirius,

Molly's got a message for you, and she says I'm not to take no for an answer. You and Harry will be spending Christmas at the Burrow. You know what she's like, I wouldn't argue if I were you.

She's also asked that you will pass on the message to Remus and Tonks.

When can we expect to see you?

Arthur."

"event","Dear Ginny,

We can't wait for you and Ron to come home. I assume Hermione's coming too. Will you ask her for us please?

Your mum had a whole list of wedding plans for me to tell you about but I don't remember any of them. She's starting to act as though I'm a woman! 

I hope things are nice and safe at school for you. We're a bit worried here at home, what with Dumbledore... you know.. but we trust Professor McGonagall to do a good job. I hope you're happy and well, and not too stressed out about school things.

Lots of love, and almost Happy Halloween.

Dad.

(P.S. sorry for the late reply)

(P.P.S. I sent along some chocolate frogs. Don't let Ron eat them all.)"

"event","Dear Ginny,

Mum has put a spell on these goods so they'll keep as long as you don't open the packets. She says she misses you very much, and is really looking forward to the Christmas holidays. 

How have things been? I hope you're keeping up to date with all your classes. Professor McGonagall has told me that Remus and Tonks are teaching, is that good? I'll be you're having loads of fun.

Well, bye for now.

Love, Dad."

"event","Dear Ginny,

We hope it wasn't too disruptive for you to have Ron back at school on such late notice.

Your mother wants to get you fitted for a Bridesmaid's dress over the Christmas Holidays, so we hope you're coming home.

Also, Mum sent you a care package - it has some biscuits and cakes, and I believe a new pair of gloves as we're coming up to the winter months.

Love from,

Dad (and Mum)"

"event","Remus,

We got your letter here last night. It was a bit confusing, but Hermione assured me that it was Harry's writing. Not sure what to make of it all, really, but I'm glad he's safe. Molly's a little reassured.

I'm slightly worried, Hermione's got that air about her; the one that says she's up to something. Well, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of it.

I heard about the Ministy muck with Rufus. If you need any help, you know I where I live. Hermione's ready to make another batch of the potion, she has all the ingredients here, except one. But I expect they're heading to Diagon Alley tomorrow for it.

Send an owl along if you need a hand with anything, maybe getting Sirius out of your hair for a while. 

Yours sincerely,

Arthur."

"event","I've just been sent an Owl. Ron and Hermione were caught trying to get into Russia, by Muggle Transport. I didn't honestly think they were that silly.

They're being held by customs, who have a staff of wizards with them, so they're caught. I'm going to head over there and see if I can get them released. I daren't let Molly know, she'd bring the Russian Ministry to it's knees.

I think I'll get Remus to help me out, just back up, those kids can be a handful and I'm sure he'll have a few things to say to them."

"event","Ron and Hermione have gone off, chasing Harry. No word to their mother. No word to me. The only person who knew anything about it was Remus, and the hoodwinked him too. 

When I got back from Grimauld Place, Molly was beside herself. I told her the news and she just broke down. It seems to only be us in the house now. Bill never leaves his room, and none of the others are actual family, though I know Molly doesn't see it like that. Perhaps Sirius will help me find the children. They are only children. Tonks might help too, apparently she's staying the night. I'll tell her in the morning.

For now, I've alerted the ministry that one of my children is missing, and international agents have been informed.

Whoever said working at the Ministry didn't have it's upsides?"

"event","Funniest thing.

I got home from work today, and Sirius Black was sitting on my couch, being fed by my wife.

Now <i>that</i> was definately unexpected.

Still, we're used to unexpected guests at this house.

I wonder what Molly's cooking for tea?"

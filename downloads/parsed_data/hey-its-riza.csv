not interested.

I have to haul so much ass this semester. It kind of pisses me off how my school has a smaller number of spots in a class than there are students that need to take it for this semester. But it's so true that no matter how much I talk about going back to NY for college, I'll be in DC.

soooo it's been snowing and raining...that's winter in NY for you haha but it doesn't matter...I still got to see the people I love and got love back so it's all good. One thing I miss about my people in NY is that they would hold me down no matter what. It's crazy what distance will do...but oh well things change but no matter what I still got so much love for these people...so it's allllllll good

haha...I was rambling back there for a bit"

"event","i have no clue why i feel so down all the time. for the past few days i have just felt like crying. hell, i'm welling up right now. people just don't get it. they don't. you can't tell someone that you know how they feel because you don't. you're not them.

my family's falling apart. it's more torn apart than it ever was before. It kind of makes me want to transfer to a college closer to home so that when shit gets even worse I can be home quicker to take care of things/people. 


My dad's an ass. I don't really give a fuck about him at all. Karma's a bitch, huh?

It's crazy how I lost contact with some of my closest friends in high school. I have no clue how or why I let that happen. 

Wow, I need to NOT be alone right now because when I'm alone I think about things too much.

I'm actually feeling kind of angry right now. I feel like punching a hole right through my wall. To deal with my anger back in high school I would go smoke a cigarette but since I quit I'm not gonna do that...so yeah, now I got nothing and yes now I do realize just how unhealthy it was to never talk to anyone about my problems, but you know what? Since college started and after leaving home and all the bullshit that goes on in my house I've been happier and people can tell. But that makes me feel like I was just running away from problems and that's not what I usually do."

We sat there around a table, drinking, talking, talking about NY and how it's so much better than DC. This one guy hit on me. He was cute...he gave me his # but I only remebered to call him yesterday. o well.</P>"

You know that song Senorita by Jin? I was in the shower this morning and it just started to play in my head...it's stuck there now

With flowers in her hair
Aww shake it senorita
Shake it if you can

I need to read Frankenstein by next Wednesday.

I love my friends...

One of my friends is really into freestyling and writing. He's recording an album now, but he's not on a label. He's a lot of fun and also really helpful. I was having a bad night last week and he called me, he could tell something was wrong and the way his voice got all sweet made me want to cry for some reason...yeah, I could talk to him and he actually helps - he doesn't just sit there all stupid. I love talking to him. He talks to me about his ""girl problems"" which I think ain't that hard to solve...but if he ever had any other problems he could go to me about it and I let him know that already

Another one of my friends is the biggest partier I know...I just want to party with him...he's back home in New York though...He does weed tho'...I don't touch that shyt anymore...but still...he's a good friend. Somehow alcohol always comes up in our conversations...but he has helped me out before when it came to relationship problems.

I have more guy friends than girl friends...that's probably why some dudes think that I ""have guys lined up""...that's pure bullshit...I don't play like that...

Yeah...there's this guy...he's an ass...he bitched at me about shyt that made absolutely no sense 

There's this girl I used to be really good friends with back Sophomore year of high school in the Philippines...I wish we were still that close. I haven't talked to her in a long time

Holy shit, I hate chemistry....I hate that fucking class"

I'm at the library's basement computer lab. They're Dell computers

There's this bald dude sitting across from me. He's cute...Oh yeah, and there's this Asian guy sitting across and left from me, he's got on a pink shirt w/ a popped collar. I want to go over there and pull it down and fix it because I don't think it looks nice

Going home this weekend! yay
I'm not homesick, not really missing my family, I just really want some home cooked food - home cooked Filipino food...I just realized that sounds a lil selfish. Well ok, I do miss my sister

I talked to Josh a couple nights ago. It's funny how he knows so much about me. heh

Yesterday I actually remembered to call DJ to wish him good luck w/ his basketball game. He said he was surprised but that he was expecting me to call? I don't know how that's possible. Then he called me back like 10 seconds late and he said that since I remembered he had a present for me...haha it was cute...he started singing the song ""My Boo"" 'cause he knows that's my favorite song

There's this guy from back home in NY who I haven't talked to in a LONG time. Every time I log into AIM he's always there, and we almost log on within 10 minutes from each other. I should say hi sometime

It's starting to get really cold out

"event","well this weekend was interesting. I went to this club called Kili's Kafe. Ok first of all it took us an hour to get there-left GW at mignight got there at 1am...It wasn't that good, I mean they was playing reggae when we got there then they just started playing all real hardcore music...after a while people started leaving the floor (around when Game Over started) But there was this FINE Dominican guy...lol I thought he was cute...we danced for a while.

We saw one of the guys Charles was with the first night I met him, I thought the guy looked familiar but I wasn't sure until he said hi...we left Kili's at 2:30 to make the last train at 3am....so yeah, that night pretty much sucked and ya'll can tell by the pure enthusiam of this post lol...


OH MY GOD but then Saturday...real real real interesting haha

That night I went to chill at my friend's dorm at HOVA. We talked about ex-boyfriends, her current boyfriend, watched this thing on Showtime about Ron Jeremy the porn director, talked about sex...yeah we ended up talking about that a lot that night lol

So anyway, while we were talking about ex-boyfriends, I started talking about Rob. during that lil conversation I mentioned that he does not talk to me anymore and how he's never online anymore, how he wants me to call him again and I never did...so Yin told me to sign onto AIM to see if he was on. He wasn't but I was expecting that. so then, randomly in the middle of me sayin somethin, Yin clicked on his screen name, slammed her hand on the keyboard, and hit ""enter""...TURNS OUT HIS ASS WAS INVISIBLE...LOL then he was like, ""hi"" She gave him my new cell # and said to call me whenever, he says ""ok boo"" & Yin was like, ""awww thats cute"" She gave me some advice(?) about him and what I should do 

so yeah...haven't gotten a call from him...do I really care THAT much? I don't know. it was weird when we ended 'cause we just started to stop talking to each other and nothing more or less than that

anyway I got midterms this week but I only have 2 - Economics tomorrow and Calculus on Wednesday (haven't started studying for either) 

I love having my friends to talk to"

- You won't believe how ""open"" people are on the shuttle. (FYI for anyone who's reading this and don't know what that is - the shuttle takes you back and forth from the Foggy Bottom campus and the Mount Vernon campus) By open I mean that some people have real personal conversations...they don't even try to hide it either.

- I want this semester to be over simply because I want chemistry to end...God I hate that class

 - RIP Rodney Dangerfield

- Finally Charles stopped calling me. Good thing he finally took the hint...in the words of a friend, ""fuck it, we don't need him any more"""

"event","well what can I say about last night? hmm well, along with my friends, we were all thinkin it would be better than it was cuz it pretty much sucked. Bout 10 people I was with. There was a party we were all gonna go to, $5 to get in (which we all knew about), but when we got there nothin was poppin...and I mean NOTHING. So we didn't even bother to pay and get in. So we stood outside the Marvin Center trying to find out what the hell we all should do...ended up we was all going back to Thurston and chillin there. 

Through all of that Charles kept calling me and I kept calling him just to see if he was gonna chill w/ us. God that got annoying...he seemed confused. He asked me earlier if he could, I said yeah, but he was havin trouble gettin in touch w/ Ron. Ron didn't wanna go to GWU without Charles. They actually had trouble trying to get to each other but in the end it (around 2am) they made it here

So when they got here me, Mildred, Amber, Charles, and Ron went to Thurston and sat there and talked. Everyone else left

Charles and Ron headed back to Howard around 3 and I ended up getting back to my dorm around 4am

Yeah...it wasn't anythin anyone expected, but damn at least it was something, not as good as we all wanted tho'

We need to make plans for next weekend, probably gonna go see wussup in Howard cuz these guys who was w/ us said things be poppin off on weekends, weekdays...so me and my GWU friends are gonna go take them up on that 

hmmm I wonder if Howard won. Ron and Charles both play for their football team...it was a pretty important game too"

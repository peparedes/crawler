"event","it has been long since i've actually updated this, huh? well... what's new?... the mall job i had? it lost me in the middle of march or so... was jobless for like 3 weeks or so... have a new job now. i work in the u-district for MJM raising money for local non-profits. finally a job that doesn't sicken me with it's pointlessness. i continue to go to school (the actual reason i still haven't figured) and to be poor. i'm in the middle of homework right now (due in 1 1/2 hours) but it's a story that i have to write, and i'm bad with endings so i'm killing time until i can find a way to finish it. i guess that's it. when i put it that way, nothing much has been happening, which is true. still madly in love. i had gotten used to getting to see justin whenever he was free, but now we have to juggle schedules again and it sucks. oh well. i'm still luckier than many people, so i won't complain (much). i'm tired. i woke up at 6 am (DON'T ASK!!!!!) and, yeah...tired. gonna try to finish now. i wonder how my story will end. (don't we all?)

Extroversion:

You have medium extroversion.
You're not the life of the party, but you do show up for the party.
Sometimes you are full of energy and open to new social experiences.
But you also need to hibernate and enjoy your ""down time.""

Conscientiousness:

You have low conscientiousness.
Impulsive and off the wall, you don't take life too seriously.
Unfortunately, you sometimes end up regretting your snap decisions.
Overall, you tend to lack focus, and it's difficult for you to get important things done.

Agreeableness:

You have high agreeableness.
You are easy to get along with, and you value harmony highly.
Helpful and generous, you are willing to compromise with almost anyone.
You give people the benefit of the doubt and don't mind giving someone a second chance.

Neuroticism:

You have medium neuroticism.
You're generally cool and collected, but sometimes you do panic.
Little worries or problems can consume you, draining your energy.
Your life is pretty smooth, but there's a few emotional bumps you'd like to get rid of.

Openness to experience:

Your openness to new experiences is high.
In life, you tend to be an early adopter of all new things and ideas.
You'll try almost anything interesting, and you're constantly pushing your own limits.
A great connoisseir of art and beauty, you can find the positive side of almost anything.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivefactorpersonalitytest/"">The Five Factor Personality Test</a></div>"

<lj-cut text=""warning: contains elements of lost sanity"">
so...you may have guessed it by now, but i'm wierd. really wired. the kind of wierd where you don't know if i'm increadibly awsome or should be locked up in a padded room. well, i'll tell you...both. (you know, it would be AWSOME to have a room padded all around in rubber that you could bounce on...) and to get BACK to the point... my name is nicole. i am 19 (and a half). i live in hell, i mean with my aunt and uncle. slowly losing my sanity. i have a boyfriend of 2 and a half years. his name is justin. we are sickeningly sweet togeather. i don't like to use caps. i can't spell that well on the first try. i'm afriad of bees and chickens and jello and being in bathrooms with no lights on and mirrors freak me out. i have a highly active imagination and am VERY easily amused. i talk alot. i am loud and quite. i'm quite the oxymoron. i tend to obsess about really awsome things easily. i love the color purple and wednesday (the day of the week) and the #5 and fruit and being warm and laughing and shiny things and spelling things like color with a ""u"" (but i restrain myself). i have a morbid and sometimes distrubing mind that, even though i seen all chipper and hyper and hippie-ish, dark things apeal to me. yay for personal tragedy!

i was born in lajolla (la hoya) california when i was an infant, lived in ocean beaches for a while (or so i'm told), moved a lot (to places like hawaii and oregon and hawaii and oregon and hawaii and washinton and oregon and san diego and oregon and washington and texas and washington and washington and now here i am, in wasington (lynnwood/edmonds). i now live right behind EDCC. isn't that special? 

i plan to do something with my life. that's about as much of the details as i've worked out for now. i'm going to finish my AA in a year (it will have only taken me 3 years to do it. okay, so my first year here was badly spent...so?) i like to write, but my muse seems to be sorrow and my unhappyness, and for the first time in a while, i'm pretty happy (for the most part). i'm mostly a poet i guess. right now i'm selling sunglasses. in the mall. in seattle. in the winter. oh, my job has such a purpose, let me tell you. 

right now i'm reading (aside from frankenstein) a book i found outside half price books for a dollar called ""dark to mortal eyes"" by some guy i've never heard of and i as of yet still couldn't really tell you what it's about, but the title was gripping and the picture was really cool. i have phases where i become obsessed with an author. right now it's orson scott card. i've already put a list of some of my authors and stuff up. i love joss whedon and neil gaiman. i also love anne mccaffrey's dragon riders of pern series, as lame as her stuff can be. movies, i like: serinity (of course); the princess bride; powder; stigmata; leathal weapon; oldschool starwars and #3; those 80's movies like pretty in pink and the breakfast club and the lost boys and the fantasy movies like labyrinth and the last unicorn and the dark crystal; superhero/comic book movies like the supermans, the four batmans started by tim burtons origional one (not the newest one though), and constintine. NOT daredevil or hulk or the LXG, those make me sad. 

i should probably end this now. wow, but it's long. i like to do this though, write my bio. i don't know why really. oh well. later all. i'm sure if you can't place me now, you'll be on the look out for me on wednesday, and i'm not hard to miss.

i ate fish last night. not much. really very little actually. it was in this cream of mushroom noodley stuff and what i really wanted was the cream of mushroom sauce, but there were little flakes of tuna or something in it as well. i don't feel bad really, maybe just slightly guilty. i don't know why i shared. just felt like it i guess.

i have been thinking lately. my thoughts are turning me from my values i guess. i don't know. i've been seriously thinking about getting a car for the only reason that i'm lazy and mostly because my aunt is always saying how i'll bla bla bla, basically putting down every thought/belief i've ever had that i've come to with out thier vast amounts of republican wisdom. i've also been thinking about getting a cell phone. i do kinda need a way to be reached because i'm never at home/hell cause i hate it there and i don't answer the phone when i am because it's never for me. i feel that i'm turning into a hypocrite. it's like i believe and say things one way, and then go ahead and serioulsy contemplate thier complete oposite. if there's anything i hate, it's hypocricity. i don't know. don't know why i shared. that's usually the kind of stuff i keep to myself and just mull over until it festers and comes to a violent boil in which i spew a rant of evry subject i can think of <i>except</i> for the one that actually caused it. i guess i'm done here now. later all.

""Viewed from the distance of the moon, the astonishing thing about the earth, catching the breath, is that it is alive. The photographs show the dry, pounded surface of the moon in the foreground, dry as an old bone. Aloft, floating free beneath the moist, gleaming, membrane of bright blue sky, is the rising earth, the only exuberant thing in this part of the cosmos. If you could look long enough, you would see the swirling of the great drifts of white cloud, covering and uncovering the half-hidden masses of land. If you had been looking for a very long, geologic time, you could have seen the continents themselves in motion, drifting apart on their crustal plates, held afloat by the fire beneath. It has the organized, self-contained look of a live creature, full of information, marvelously skilled in handling the sun.""

"event","so, i finally have a new job. after a month and a half of no one wanting to hire me because i'm a talentless hack, i finally conned some desperate manager to pay me in exchange for services rendered. these services by the way are in sales in the mall. (at least it's not fast food, even though i hate the mall). i'm one of those annoying people in those kiosk (that's a wierd word) thingies who try to get you to buy something you really don't need. i try to sell sunglasses in seattle (lynnwood, whatever) in the winter... yeah, i know. i would feel bad about the pointlessness of my job, like i hated working at papa murpheys and helping to continue the fattening of america, but i figure that people who are at the mall already are perpared to spend tons of money on over-priced crap that they don't really need, so it's okay. i don't think i'm going to be there for long. probably only 3 months or so, but THIS TIME i'm going to make sure i have another job lined up <b>before</b> i quit. well, maybe i'll think aabout quitting after spring break. i gotta go to my families then for a few days. i guess i'm done now. is it sad that i get bored being online. i can never think of anything to do after checking my e-mail and live journal other than playing neopets and watching flash. oh well. 

by the by, i'm now taking a graphic design class. can anyone (if there is anyone who actually reads this) who knows me acutally see me doing this for a living? please respond to this. i'd like some feedback.

"event","i'm killing time online cause i want to make absolutely POSITIVE that <i>they</i> are very much unconscious when i get back. i do <b>not</b> want to speak to/with either of them right now. especially my aunt. my god people! today i got slightly reprimanded by my aunt for not eating meat. she said things like i do it because i'm a teenager (19, wtf?) and do it to be different and unique. like i'm the ONLY person in the ENTIRE world who doesn't eat meat. see, my friend (yes, i have friends) was over yesterday and she's vegan and so my aunt brought her into it to saying something like 'when she's 25 she still won't be doing that' or something (not an exact quote). then i turned the conversation back on me, cause it's not right for my aunt to be ticked with me and bring someone else into it as an example for how i do wrong. and she was talking about how the world has been doing fine as it is for the past bla bla bla bla bla and now i'm trying to change the world cause i ""saw the light"" or whatever (sarcastically said of course) about eating meat. i don't try to change anyone or their eating habits. i respect everyone's differences and would like them to respect mine. but she was like 'since your non-meat eating isn't a moral or religious issue (and here she referenced catholicism and lent) then you should make a personal sacrifice at times when you would be in danger of insulting you hostess.' a particular example is this chili that was for dinner last night, and i could have eaten it, because there wasn't <b>MUCH</b> turkey and i wouldn't have been able to <b>TASTE</b> it, so there souldn't have been a problem with it. and she basically said that vegetarianism is ""ridiculous"" (she actually said that, but i'm not sure if she meant just my case, or in general). i have my reasons. just because they don't seem like the RIGHT reasons to some people, doesn't mean that i should go eat a large steak or something. it just pissed me off that she was trying to turn me away from not eating meat. then she had to mention how my eating habits aren't exactly healthy. which pisses me off because i know i'm not doing very well in eating right, but when i have to live THERE and deal with all their various crap, i end up eating and watching a lot of tv because it's the only thing i can feel good doing in that house. so far she's made me feel guilty about spending too much time in my room, because i'm not being ""social"". i just plain don't WANT to spend too much time upstairs around them, cause they just <i>talk</i> at me. there was a recent ""confrontation"" about music, don't even get me started. so i get snide comments about my tv watching and my eating. and i also get lectures about proper socializing in a ""family"" and a ""household"" and how i need to get better at talking with people. when i socialize just fine when not there, it's just that <b>I DON'T FREAKING LIKE THOSE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b> and do NOT want to chit chat with them if i can help it. they wouldn't be able to fathom my not liking them tho, and i'm too nice to say it to them. and as for ""family"" and ""household"", those are not words that i use to discribe who i like with or where i live. they are my aunt and uncle, RELATIVES and i live in a freaking cave and i barely spend any real time around the house, but i'm still expected to do whatever asinine chores my aunt can pull out of her ass for me to do. and i freaking do them. as it is so nicely phrased, ""home is where the heart is"" and if that is true, then my home is with justin, and the PLACE that i still consider to be my home is with my FAMILY; consisting of my stepmom and siblings and various other people who live with them. they are my family and my home is with them in vancouver (only because that's where they live, i like seattle BUNCHES better). i live in a cavelike basement room in my aunts house in which i feel like a guest who has overstayed her welcome. i wish i could get my act together and get my ass out, but i'm scared of the big bad world and all the responsibility that is waiting to pounce when i get out there."

"event","i feel like bitching. lalala. my foot freaking hurts. it's hurt since last night. in this one particular area. the side of it (right foot, big toe). like where the bone is. did i mention i work at a job where i stand up ALL THE FREAKING TIME? well, i do. and it blows when your foot toe area is in all kinds of pain. i'm thinking maybe i'm a bit on the masochistic side. tho i don't really feel pleasure from standing on my freaking foot for 6-7 hours straight today. it freaking sucked. but instead of taking the half and hour that nightly paperwork takes to just reast my foot, instead i swept the floor (big-ish floor) and did all the dishes (like 45 min), THEN i sat down. i guess one of the definitions of the work fits (yes, i wasn't sure how it was spelt, so i looked it up): "" 3- a willingness or tendency to subject oneself to unpleasant or trying experiences."" i don't freaking know. i was supposed to be offline (according to me) five minutes ago. i think i'll go buy myself icecream on my way home. i deserve it. later."

"event","is wrong with me lately? i've been reading around, in various journals and such, and i've come to the conclusion (which has been fermenting in my mind for a while now) that i've just become a superficial and childish whatever. i've not really written anything of substance (or really anything at all) since early this year. since then i've been relatively happy, and i guess my only muse is depression. happy or numb. both i think. a little more numb tho. i haven't truly written anything in about a year and a half... it's not just the writing though. it's everything. everything i talk about. most of what i think. okay, not what i think. i still have some thoughts with some depth to them. i just don't communicate them really in any way. i don't know. i spend most of my energies on school and work (and bitching oh so much on the continuing downward spiral of my god forsaken job) til it eats most of me up, then with what i have left i spend on justin and waste the extras on retarded tv (which, to be perfectly honest, i think is stupid and pointless and i didn't really miss much when i over reacted and went insane about a year ago and stuck mine in my closet) which i assume i use primarily as an escape because living where i live is slowly draining me of everything that i am with all the mind games and the feelings of guilt and how i'm probably disappointing them, even though i told myself that i don't care what they think, it's a lie cause i do. i always care. what everyone thinks because i just don't want to disappoint them. and they think i'm such a shallow and immature and selfish person because i don't feel that i can be myself around them, or even in that house ate all really, and i just REALLY don't like them at all and want to spend as much time away from them as possible. then my aunt gives me shit about spending a lot of time in my room, so now i barely go in there and i feel weird when i am in there alone. i used to love being in my room alone. that's where i would write and just do whatever. that was with my stepmom and my actual FAMILY and i felt myself there. and i miss it so much. and so i just stay up until i'm exhausted and crash in my bed, then wake at the last minute and rush off to school. i loath going upstairs in the morning. i KNOW they're there, and i just DON""T want to interact with them. and so i get shit about when i wake up. and they just dont' get that i behave how i do because i can't stand them, and i do what i can to keep what sanity there still is in me. i always feel like the errant child, and they feel this need to parent me. i haven't really been parented since i was 8. there was the brief time when i was taken in my my friends family, but aside from that i looked out for myself. i fed myself, i did my laundry, i gathered what advice i needed from my dad and his friends and good tv and books and teachers and molded it all into myself. i extrapolated what i could from everywhere and taught myself about the birds and the bees and the feminine ""stuff"" (except for shaving, which i got a few tips from my best friend's mom and my dad's at the time girlfriend), and i made some pretty good decisions about life and choices i should make, all things considered. but they don't consider any of that. they look at me and see a poor little orphan girl who lost her mom young and didn't have that figure to model myself after, and who's dad did the best he could but to them i don't think it was good enough, who doesn't seem to take shit seriously and who is sarcastic and immature and should be treated like she's 14 and checked up on to see if she's at work and can't be trusted to take care of her own education and is horrible and sinful and stupid for sleeping with her boyfriend before marriage (hypocrites, that's all i have to say on that matter) and everything else unacceptable to them. they don't see that i bust my ass for my job and my school and my boyfriend and to try to make them like me even though i really don't what to care what they think and that i stayed away from all the bad shit that i could have gotten into because of my rocky childhood, and i'm finishing school when i could have just given up and that i have high moral ideas about love and sex and i would never have done anything if it hadn't felt right (because i hadn't before). i'm not like them in their thoughts and beliefs so i need to be trained to become the next jennifer, popping out millions of babies like a good catholic wife with issues with her mother. they see my childhood and how i was raised and it's not how they would have done it, so it's wrong and must be amended. never mind that i was happy. never mind that i look back on it with nothing but fondness. i was raised by artistic parents with hippie-ish qualities in a semi-nomadic and kinda poor lifestyle and i wouldn't trade that for all the middle class surburban houses with the picket fances and soccer practice and minivans and cubicle clone parents. i've just so lost touch. i have thoughts and ideas and beliefs but i have no knowledge to back it up. and i have no drive to find that knowledge. i'm just numb and coocooning myself in my own little bubble. the rare bursts of reality that find their way through bring tears to my eyes with their substantial rawness. 

wow. that was a lot. it's good to get that out i guess. just things that i've been tumbling through my mind for a while now. i guess i'm not totally out of this teem angst phase. a writing class....hmmm. i'm gonna go check if any are available for fall quarter. night all. ~later"

"event","So, this is what I expierience.

Down Time:

Short or long stints where I am aware of my weight but eat like a normal person and simply maintain my weight. (This comprises most of my time it seems)

Active:

Where I am practicing my weight loss rituals. These times can last days - months. the logest active time I have had was 3 months long and I had lost about 30 lbs. (I went from 183 - 149). I then got depressed because I found out I was moving away from my life basicaly, and ""ate my feelings"" (really bad move).

Obviously I prefer my active time. I lose weight when I am active.

Now for my days when I am active:

Food fear days:

Days when I see what I consider a substantial amount of weight loss. I am for that day (or longer) afraid to eat anything at all really. I am scared the food will destroy the success.

Binge Purge days:

Days when I will keep eating and (getting rid of it). I really dislike having to do that. Infact, I hate it. (This is why people with bulimia try to switch over to anorexia, it seems better to just simply NOT eat the food than to have to sit over a toilet cryng, puking, and feeling like crap.)

Good days:

The perfect days, when I eat under 600 calories, and do not have any discomfort. I usualy feel more energetic and want to do things. I feel happy with life, and still manage to lose weight. (I wish days could always be those days)

Bad days:

When I screw up and eat over 1,000 calories and do not get rid of any of it, sit on my ass all day, and end up gaining weight the next day. (I hate that shit)...

Not hungry days:

Days when I'm just NOT hungry, at all... I usualy feel really cold on these days though, not sure why. It's not like I'm skinny. I'm huge so why would I feel so cold??? These days I usualy curl up with coffee to stay warm, under a blanket and ""contemplate life"" or, just watch E!. LOL!!! I also take a lot of baths on these days to feel warm.

So they usualy follow eachother in some kind of patern.
Maybe I should try to monitor it and see which days 
follow which. I already know that the food scared days
will follow any days where I lose a good amount of 
weight. I'm having one of those days today. My prediction
is that tomarrow I will have a ""good day"". =)"

"event","Ok well today is great... I weighed my self and I am down to 201!!!
Thats still fat, I know but still. My eyes just lit up when I saw that, because I had reached a platou I think for a couple days. The way I'm viewing all of this now though, when I had hit it, it didn't unmotivate me, I knew what it was and dispite it bothering me I just kept doing what I was doing and it payed off! I was stuck at 203 for like 3-4 days!! I was like wtf?!?! But now it's gone. Phew. I'm so glad!!! Yesterday I did something I do not <i>plan</i> on doing again. I ate a bagle knowing full well I was going to ""get rid of it"" afterwards. Usualy I will just be eating and not thinking about it and do that; Not plan it out. My throte hurt a lot because earlier on in the day I had tai rice and found out it was 600 cals per bowl!!! D: There was NO way that was sticking around, hell no! I shouldn't have assumed that it was low cal just because it was stupid rice. The sauce that went with it was what ruined that assumption... So yeah yesterday my throte had a bad day lol. But hey! At least I'm under 203 FINALY! I'm so impatient... LOL. We went for a walk last night too. I told my self I was going to, and, I almost didn't. I didn't feel like it but I'm glad I did. Walking is low impact and wont build a lot of muscle weight so I can keep going for walks everyday until I'm down to that 196 (hopefully by the 13th!).

Seems like this time all of my motivation is comming from a different place. Feels like this time I might actualy succeed. I know I said that lat time to, and I did feel that wy last time. I just didn't have any ongoing motivation here infront of my face. Now I do. It's not like I'm suddenly going to stop seeing my self now. The video blog is help with that also. As long as I keep making those I will be able to look back and see small differences in my face until I look the way I had started to look in L.A. I WANT that now. I really want it now. I watched a show lastnight on E! and it was inspiring. Sad at the same time though, and I don't want to get *sick*. But... Shows like that are always ""thinspirational"" even if that is not what they are ""supposed"" to be... Hell, it's where I got all of my ideas as a kid even; Shows like that.

I think I will try to fast today so that the weight doesn;t go back up somehow. I'm always so scared of that!!! D:"

I was pleasantly surprised however, when 
I signed in and on the 2nd it said 
I weighed 209, and I only weigh 203 now. 

=)

So I just need to keep it up, and hopefully
the pounds will keep comming off the way they
are now. I'm not going to really start working
out until I meet that goal. I want to be well
under 200 before I do that. I'm always scared
I will gain numbers back by gaining muscle mass
or something LOL. Muscle weighs more than fat
after all! I'd like to say I could just go by
a measuring tape (wouldn't we all!) but the
fact is that, the nature of the beast is always
to want to see numbers falling off of that
scale when we step on it. Y'know? =/

I only purged once yesterday. I should have
done it twice though because I was stupid and
had two grilled cheese sandwiches. =( I feel
gross now. I purged some of the fried rice
shit I hat in the morning. At least that got
rid of that, well, some of it. 

More good news though! I found a sugar free
syrup my step mom had. It's hazelnut flavored
and sweetened with splenda! 0 calories! =D
so I'm really glad about that. Now I don't have
to keep using regular sugar for my coffee! =)"

It's so weird. I've been here on 
livejournal for soooo many years. 
I keep making new profiles for 
various reasons. Either to 
""start over again"" the whole 
""clean slate"" thing. Thats why 
this one is here. Actually... 
I guess thats really the only 
reason I ever do this. I have 
communities on here too lol. 
Some that have failed. And some 
that, after all these years, still 
thrive. Oddly enough I just saw 
one of my old communities advertised 
on another community hahahaha... 
Funny. It makes me happy, makes me 
feel accomplished somehow. Like 
that one little part of me still 
lingers on even when I am away. 
I'M STILL HERE!! LOL! =) People with 
E.D. cling together like a family. 
I suppose thats why it's 
comforting to make these little 
journals. To see how everyone 
is doing, and to let people know 
how I am. We actually CARE about 
eachother. We inspire or rather 
""thinpire"" ;) eachother. We support 
one another. Through the years though 
it seems like livejournal has 
died down. I wonder... Where is 
everyone? Myspace? Xanga? Friendster? 
I'm on myspace too... and I had 
created a Xanga account aswell but 
never used it. No matter what 
though, when it comes to my E.D. I am 
loyal to livejournal. It's where I 
first discovered my ""online E.D. 
family"". It was thanks to these 
communities that I had lost the weight 
I did so long ago. And I hope it will 
be help from these communities 
that I will again. So... Hi everyone, 
for the gazillionth time. LOL!

Yesterday we went out to eat.
I had done ok through out the
day but the going out did me
in. I get so bored here. Not
like I was going to turn down
the invitation to get out of 
the house. I had a good meal.
I had salad, and a tofu with
pasta dish. Durin the day I
had only had 3 cups of coffee
with a spoon of sugar, and
of cream each. So thats 3
spoons of sugar, and 3 spoons
of cream. I had a small salad
and 1/4th of an avocado. I
also had a 1/2 cup of cereal
for breakfast with 1/4 cup
of milk. It was grape nuts
so those are low cal... I
think that was all I had...

I was bad when I came home though.
I came home and had a full cup of
ice cream. That was very stupid of
me. So I went up stairs and decided
that since I ate a full cup of ice
cream. I needed to throw up a full
cup of everything. Ice cream melts.
So the cup of ice cream I ate would
have only been about a half cup
when it had melted. None the less,
I needed that cup full. I found my
self feeling bad throwing up the
tofu. I know it's good for me and
I guess it is silly to have guilt
about throwing food up. So I did
it anyway. The cup was full. I no
longer have a problem controling
how the food comes up. It use to
just get all over the place! I can
flex my stomach muscles to get it
up most of the time now though.
So 3/4th of the cup was just me
pushing it out with those muscles.
Then I did have to use my fingers
for the last couple ""thrusts"".

See... After a while you learn to
be very quiet about your purging.
People suspect when you run to the
bathroom after your meals. So it
gets frustrating having to answer
everyones questions. Theres a good
trick to it too, in public when 
you need to. Drink a lot of liquid
with your meal. Water, soda, juice
doesn't matter when it's comming
back out again anyway, right?
You can sit on the toilet normaly
and just flex the muscles like a
bird and it just comes right out.
you can spit it down into the
toilet if you have good aim. It
takes practice. But it's a good
tip so that people don't see your
feet backwards in the stall and 
hear you gagging you self lol. =)

""Normal"" people probably would 
read this and get grossed out
but I know my fellow mias out
there probably have a note pad
and a pen! ;D Or are just taking
a mental note of it. *wink*

So... So far I've lost about 7
pounds. I've been at it for a
week and a half. Dieting. Not
mia. That just started back up
a few days ago. Funny how you
can end up being your ver own
thinspiration. Not in a good 
way most of the time however,
unfortunately! Hehehehehehe...

Until next time. 
Stay out of the frige!!!

"event","My Dreams are starting to manifest inside of my head
They keep getting darkier and more vibrant..
I drempt that I was part of the Cia or something like that
in a suit with weapons to kill. I remember going around in some wierd building
almost like a prision but not. Look for someting. 
But it was like out of a horror movie. but not quite
the building was well lit
everything was a baby blue colour rust spots
some green mold
there were just shallow pools of water in the middle of rooms giant..
well not giant bout the size of a underground swimming pool.but only like 6 inches deep sort of thing
they were clear. could see every little crack in the bottom of the pool.
Me and my team keep going deeper. Pipes filled the celing. They were black and brown..
dirty pipes dripping gross brown water from the seems.
There was no sounds exept for our foot steps as we made our way down the long hallway. this are was much much darker. dimly lit. we made it to another set of rooms. this time bodies lay everywhere
but not human. none of them were alive. they were all pasty white..their veins blue sticking out...dead..
the room did not smell thou..we made our way back up into a loading dock. there were probably 12 loading docks.. there was a huge parking lot blocking them..they haddent been used in years..
we made our way to a black car. guns were bein distributed. the area was heavily populated. a fence between two buildings held people back..they had a barrle with fire..it was the middle of the day in the summer. we were all dressed in black it was scorching hot but i did not feel the heat. too many things going on in my mind. i asked if i could have a gun. they nodded. i must have been new.

they passed me a gun and as we walked to a new building an appartment building me and one other guy passed a vehical with a man who looked at us with an evil grin. my partner kept walking. an old lady passed and obsturcted my view..as i caught glimse of the man he was pulling up a weapon. I shot him dead in place..it was all in slow motion like the moment would last forever in my mind. He was my first kill.

Then i found myself alone in the appartment. It was dimly lit again...this time the hallway was a puke green colour almost the celing seemed as if it bled black downt he walls. there was a massive vent above my head. A Snake came towards me through the hallways. probably 30ft long. I stood there I have seen him before in many of my other dreams. This time thou it was differnt.. He did not try and kill me. He only stared into my eyes then flew un into the vent above. He lowered down a cardbord box. probably a foot and half cubed. It was all battered. A single rope holding the weatherd top closed. I didnt know what to think of this box..all confused..i took it back into my dim appartment. closed the door. I passed by my white ancient fridge. I slowly oped the box...and that is the end..
I can not remember what else happened.
My Dreams...What do they mean..
Why do they haunt me."

Breath in.
Take in one last breath.
Feel the sweet taste of the nights dew on the tip of your lips.
Feel it all slipping away.
Its all going now.
Watch your eyes roll into your skull.
Watch your legs collaps under your dead weight.
The love of your life ripping out your very soul.
Such a bitter sweet symphony.
Such sights to see you only left with darkness.
Love is so fake.
Cry out your withered life out.
Cry out for that last hope.
Did you actually think it would come?
Pitiful boy.
Pitiful."

Soul searching.
Lost in a black forest, only known as my heart.
Weary from the walk.
Back and forth.
Digging my grave.
Wearing down life.
Age fades from my face.
Young and restless.
Dreams are forgotten.
Where have I been?
Where am I going?
Open hands begging for mercy.
Lost am I with out my creation.
Bleeding for answers.
None will follow.
Save me.
Please.
Save me."

Flowing words ramble on into nonsence
Anger exudes from the pours of my skin
Wrap my soul in this broken world
See how far my blood can flow
Dragging this knife called love against my skin
Penetrating the very innards of my soul
Ripping my life appart
Slivering my soul
Take me out of my missery
This is my final bout
This is the out that I have dreamed of
Put that bullet called life and burry it into my mind
Finish off what dreams have set to do
End my existance
Finish life."

Dreaming once of beinging the world to you
That knight in shining armour.
That boy holding the red red rose
standing at your front door

my head is bowed down
my eyes ask for forgiveness
i stare into your crying eyes
lost and along i find myself on the curb of life

I dream of the night
where i can hold you in my arms
wispering sweet nothings
loving your breath on my lips

remembering that first kiss
is all i have in life
the times we shared
the times we havnt
im lost with out you

I lye in bed alone and unforgiven
I feel for you but you are not by my side
I can not live this life
not with out the love of my life

dreaming of a new tommorow
i find myself in a black hole
come dig me out of my grave
bring me back to life

I sing this song
no words can describe my hurt
my tears fall my voice shallow
lost with out you dreaming of you

please come find me
i need your love in my life
i can not live with out my drug
my dirty little whore."

I am eating the life of the people i care about
Stealing their souls for my petty dreams
Ripping their bodies limb from limb

Dripping emotions held by a fear of falling
Tears of blood dripping down my finger tips
Lifeless love,
Forsaken hope.

My dreams have turned black and haunt my mind
My hope is fading and a new tommorow never comes
Hopes are forgotten
Dreams are dead.

I need To break out of my mold. 
I need to break out of my body.
I need to break out of my life.
I need to break out of my soul.

I dream of flying
But my wings are torn
I hope for sunlight
But only black comes.

I hope For light.
But it is eaten by hatred.

I can not break this dream I call life
I can not shake this hold on my heart.
Some one safe my from the epitimy of my soul
Some one take me to the haven.

Tears of heartach flow down
My blood is as wine.
My body turned to bread.
Only the wine has turned sour
and the bread has gone moldy.

Hope fades......"

Bleeding confessions

Its almost a dream world, I feel like im floating around dead looking down upon a world that is decaying and slowly molding. Death is all my weary eyes seems to see as of late. My dreams are getting more frequent...if you could call them dreams...nightmares seem to fit the discription a little better. It feels like my life is draining out of my veins. My soul is drying out. No matter how much water i take in i feel like im decomposing. I cant breath. Im suffocating in this body. i want to break free of my life no matter the cost. I need to feel again. Cutting makes me feel alive. watching my blood drip down my finger tips. Watching the non-existant life that i am living draining away. I need to live again. I need to feel again. No matter the cost. No matter what i do. I need to break free. These chains are becomming unbearable. I cant lift the weight any more. My body is weak. Death seems like the only out. I just want to get out of this. Break free from this. Someday.."

Twisted mind altered by words of the unspoken, left with a feeling of bitter hope.
Torn appart by the immages of the past, shattered dreams, broken lives.
Shallow life lead by an even more shallow cacoon.
Empty of all light that one burned inside of a hope.
Where has this dream dissapeared to. Why.? 
Do I even bother dreaming of a hope.
Do I even wish for a life of dreams.
Foolish, hopes.
I want to go back, back to the day of dreams.
I want to fly back home to where I belong.
Mabey its in my hopes and dreams my soul emptys itself into an epitmy of lostness.
Take one more breath.......still noting....still just here...nothing more..noting less...
Do I hope to fullfill myself one moon from now.....one blue blue moon...
I shout my shallow voice thru the mountains once lived on
Please someone reach out to me....
Please someone refill my dreams....
I cant live this empty life any more...
I cant live this empty life any more...
Knowing there is more....
Dreaming about the more there is...

There was this mand in a green room i remember with either a green or brown carpet. A computer to one side and a brown book shelf on the other side full of text books of sum sort. He was sitting on a brown computer chair infront of his window. It was large. He was all taped up. Head to toe. Was at first struggling. I thought maybe he was like being attacked by someone. But then he satarted to push the chair out of the window. He managed to pull back and i saw his face. his eyes.

I wish that I was able to see that golden path that led to where I am supose to go. I hate following a path that ends up in a dead end. Thou that is beggingin to sound like my life story. Its hard you know to follow down the way that you think is right. You put your heart into it then Bam. Shot down and you are left to pick your remains up off the ground and start over again. It can get to a person. And as hard as it is I also am thankful for how it is. I get to see life grow. See light bloom from within. My soul grows darker but at times for a faint second i am able to see that light that i once had within my soul. I know that life is worth living. I just need to do someting with it. Maybe I will do it. See new things meet new people. But maybe i wont get over my fear. I need to be strong. I need to find the strength within me. Find a hope that is locked away. Soon."

Colours are being shot throught the magnificant sky.
Clouds are set on fire with a wonderous glow of colours.
Changing into wonderous spectrums for the eye.
Our hearts melt at the sight of this wonderful experience
 
The fires of colour calm their fury and all that is left
Is the blackness of another day that has come to an end.
The darkness of the covers the land and hides it from the world
And when it seems all hope is lost the magnificant glow of the
Moon burns into our hearts and reminds us that another day is comming.
 
The darkness of the night seems to drag on for an eternity
It feels like the dawning of a new day shal never come again.
Then a burst of light shoots up from the horizon.
Our hearts wake up again and are ready for a new day."" ~



Now that I come to think about it I wonder if I ever named this poem. But if I were to name it now I would have to call it life. To think that poem is probably 2 if not 3 years old. Wow not to gloat but I did fairly well for a 15 or 16 year old. Now all that comes to mind is agony of another broken soul. Hrm I wonder what I can come up with on the spot...




Far from home, burried in a hole over flowing with the tears of tommorow.
A family broken for the profit of the world.
An empty soul smiles beliving that it is fulfilled.


hrm for somereason i dont think a poem is what i need to do right now too many thoughts to try and put it into poetic form....lets do some writing..dont mind the pain that i am about to exude.


Take a look around. What do you see. I mean really close your eyes tight see noting think of noting just close your eyes and open them. What is really there. You see the same thing that is shown to you every day but at the same time for a split second it all seems new. I see people from my window walking around outside. I see everyone from base ball players to drug deals to little children comming home from school..all just in front of my house. I see a sientist, I see a new child born, I see pain I see anger. I see the death of a loved one through eyes of unspeakable hurt. Yet. At the sametime i see noting. My eyes are able to see but i am blind. Thou not fully. I can see where life is. Unfortunatly it is painful. Almost a curse. I wish I didnt have to see the world as it truly is. Why do we have to live in the media. Why do we have to want what we cant be. We are no less people because we are not on tv. Some of the best people out there live in a small town just serving coffee. Seeing the same people every day and finding out that their son just turned 8 and all is right in the world with them. If it was only that easy. If only we could live such lives. But the majority live lives of hope that is un reachable. The stars have not been set around for what they want. They were not ment to do that. Yet out of spite they reach knowing they are only going to disapoint themselves. I belive in dreams. I belive in goals. I think that if you want someting that you will get it. But you have to understand why i contradict myself. The people that want their dreams will recive them. What I'm saying is that the people that just want their dreams and know they cant have them arent going to have them because they dont work hard enough for them. I belive that everything is possible. But you have to sacrafice for those dreams. You cant live a life that you want these days. I live day to day. I dont expect anyting becasue when someting comes along it is the most amazing thing. 

I have to sometimes re evaluate my situation. Decide why I bother to take another breath. Its harsh when the out come is because my body wont allow me to stop breathing. But I move along with the flow and push my way as to where I am supose to be. Its hard thou sometimes for me. The whole not knowing. I feel like im wrapped in a prision cell. My lungs arent able to breath and all that I am used for is just another person for mosters to suck the life out of...helpless. It almost feels like my naked body is exposed to the world and it is deformed. I am being pointed at and people run away screaming. I feel like some hedious creature mutated into who in heaven knows what. Arms growing out of me. My face massacared. My body all twisted and horrified. I am put to death because of who i look like. A horrible beast. There is no point to living right. I walk around and look at the world wishing that this is all a dream and i would wake up not having to live such a horrible nightmare again. But I wake up every day to the same nightmare. Only a few things are worth living for in life. And even at that sometimes the things that are worth living for are hard to live for. My soul feels like its burning up. Its becomming hollow from the inside eating its way out of my body. I am becomming numb not wanting to feel another pain. Why it that I destoy myself so. I need to get out of this prision. I need to breath. I need to feel. I need to live. Please someone help me to fly again with my broken wings. My tears are slowly drowning me I need to get out of this body and fly again. It is broken, twisted, shattered. Let me live again. Let me hope again. Let me love again."

"event","You know what, I have come to realize that the life that a person lives is not as much as we make it to be. I mean for once in a long while im not being negative on this subject of ""life"", but really what is life composed of truly for the average person. Take a moment to think about it. *tick* moments over. Life is noting but an act of occurances, random if you live by the worlds viwes, planed by god to follow some sort of bigger picture. Im sure if i tried i could try and see some sort of picture but you know what i want to see whats goin on down here first and try to understand it.

First of your born i mean really out of what a bazillion sperm u made it. WELCOME TO THE WORLD right. Flashy lights pretty shiney objects. Wow were pack rats. Look at that right. I mean for some reason every one wants on the cover of someting for whatever reason. We all want to be doing soemting but if you look hard enough in the bigger picutre what are we really doing. Someone told me once there was things like bills to look forward to. And for them that is aweomse but i just think there is so much more than looking forward to paying the next bill. I mean really god put us here to pay bills?? How lame is that i mean if that is my mean of existance then please just let me kill myself right now. But no i dont think thats the real reason were here. This thought that were just wasting our lives awway doing the same old shitty thing every day just makes no sence it almost makes me want to puke like smelling dog puke after eating a huge turkey dinner.....stupid garlic breath...sorry dwelling on the past...and no no dogs were in this story.

Anyways back to me...cauz thats what its really allll about right lol. I think that there are too many mest up ppl out there to just be standing round on our pants and doing noting about it. I mean not all our goals are going to be the same in life but that doesnt mean that we have to all do noting. I mean yes not all jobs that god is going to give are going to be out there and stuff. Sometimes yah the reason he put you here is to be a mom or a dad but hey its not for me and you know what to who ever reads this chances are its probably not for you. So what are you going to do about it. Well right now im being a lazzy ass and going to mc donalds to work every day. I make a few dollars but in the end run will it mean much to me...no no not really. Its an experience and that is what im going to take it for. I mean will i work there for the rest of my life....Heck no. If i work there for much longer im going to have to kill myself. I mean yah its great working with the people. I love them their so rad....well the ones that i like anyways, but i mean its not a life time goal. Im starting to get comfortable with the job and that cant mean a good thing lol.

For me I want to get out there visually or lyricly. I want to either make movies/video games or whatever visually caus i love that kind of stuff or i want to make music. I want to sing to all the broken people. To let them know that there is hope. That you know what i have been broken batterd smashed and left for dead but i have come out and i know that they can to. And you know what there is noting more powerful than that in my oppinion. For me. This doesnt mean its going to be the same for you. You are differnt than me. You are goiing to find out who you are and you know what do something about it. Dont skew round with your time because you are going to be a fat beer bellyied guy sittin watching tv or a wife of some ass. Get out there because there is someing huge out there for you."

"event","Sometimes I think to myself what I should be doing with myself where I should be going and how I should act. And thou I come up with some interesting senarios none of them are realistic. I realize that no matter how hard I try I can never be the perfect person that I would some day like to be. In the end I will always end up making the same wrong choices and hurting the same people that I love. Why? I really actually couldnt tell you. There is no reason for it. Thou there is an explination that I can come up with. I am a very very lazy person. In not making nessasary choices I end up hurting myself and the people around me. Thou sadly enough this isnt just me. If I were to look at every person in this world most would have the same problem in lack of chocies made as I do. Im not perfect and I never will be as much as I and someother people would like me to be. I will always go down a path that I shouldnt I will always say something that I didnt mean. So that just makes me wonder. How can anyone be perfect for someone. Wow this is just going everywhere. I wish I could talk more but it is 8:28 and I start work at 9:00 It is time to head out I belive.

Just as an end note. Try this out. Make a choice at the beggining of the day to be positive. And go through it for the whole day. See if you can. This is my chalenge to you. See if you can have a fully positive day. And if not dont beat yourself up just wake up the following day and try again. Let me know if any of you succeed.

"event","I sit here knowing that I am only flesh and blood. My thoughts have a purpose to an extent but in all reality i am noting but part of the whole. Its a hard consept to grasp and hold because my human nature wants everything to be about me and what I want to do while I know there is better out there. I can see this world its so far apart but so close together at the same time. Everyone is intertwined with everyone else. Think about it. You know someone and they know other people. Its a giant web of connections. One ripple in the web and sure not everyone will feel it but part of the web feels it.We are all family. We are all brothers and sisters. One cut and everyone bleeds in one way or another. But in the same sence we are wrapped up in our own little worlds and seclude ourselves from what is real. From what matters. We would rather stay in our cacoon we have built up rather than come out a beautiful butterfly. Why must we hide ourselves. Maybey some day we will all connect again. We will all become one because in the end that is what we will all be. One. We were born of dust and will return as dust in the end. Some how as i write this my eyes are slowly being opened to the truth that lies within my heart. I know that there is more out there than what we see but we choose not to see any more than we have to. 

My concentration has been broken but if you can at all grasp what i am trying to speek through my words you understand the depth that this goes. It is the whole that your heart has been seekin to fill. The truth, the knowledge, the love, only from the one our lord. Mabye some day we will all be able to breath a true breath of life.

I mean really in the end all that really happens is maybe my mother cries and the rest of the world keeps moving on like always. whats a death. unless you are famous no one really could care less. I could kill hundreds of thousands....but in the end that wont accomplish anyting but pain. So i'll just take my own life into my hands. slit my wrists. blood covers my body. i marinade in my own life. how fun. Going to be a pretty nasty meat. a flick of the wrist. a slip of a finger. bang bang. look mommie i put a new fucking hole through my head. Isnt that just interesting. Maybe i shove a stick throu it. could be a bran new trend....

"event","Im sometimes curious about why we live such lives we do. Why is it we always second guess ourselves and in the end, end up kickin ourselves. What is the point of toremnting ourselfs to the point of oblivion. Why is it that we do these things to ourselves and you would think that by the first couple of times we would learn but no no. We do it again and again and again and again and again and you know what it just doesnt end. Life is a vicious circle that just doesnt want to stop. Its like a train that just never stops going and if you get in its way well then quite horrid things happen. Lets just put ourselves in a blender and see what happens. Its a lot better than shototing yuouself in the foot over and over again. Atleast this way its all over in one little press of a button. squeeze of a trigger. Wow im so pessomistic. Im not suicidal at all. Just not sure where im going or what im doing or what people are saying behind my back or who i can trust or or or or or. And you knwo what i tell you love is quite a tragesty. Ha that is what quite seriously destroys me the most. Tears my innards to peices. My soul yearns for the one person. But with as much energy that goes into finding that person my soul is slowly drained of life. It feels like i have a leak in my heart and im nearing my end. I get filled up part way with hope but in the end it was noting but coloured water. I thought that was real. like life was real. But no no its not its just the circle again. Im curious why i keep fooling myself into beliving that it could be real. I dunno i'll just keep trucking on. Push forward lol try and go where no man has gone before right lol yes that is it....

anyways im not done ranting but that is for later. bie all

My mind running back and forth from thought to thought. I try and sort out all my thoughts and focus my mind but as of late my mind has picked up a concience of its own almost. I dont seem to have much control. Helpless I hear a howl of a wolf in the distance and the chatter of crickets and frogs off in the weeds.Why was I being haunted. Why is my soul so blackened.

Shouts of pain shreaked through the air as bullets flew by heads. Commands screamed out in the distance for advancement echoed through the shattered trees. My body lay on the ground pulsating. It felt as if my entire body wanted to jump out of its skin. A burning sensation slowly drove me crazy. I took ten angry peices of metal to my body. Skin peirced and body broken. Blood flowed through my limp courpse like a river.

"event","As I look past the old oak tree on top of the hill in the green orchard, past the little creek, with the old broken swing hanging off of it I realized that my broken soul cries out to the soft falling sun. The skies were coloured with such magnificant glory it was if they were painted for the heavens. My sight blurred the sky and ground into one as my past played like a movie inside of my eyes. 

I could see her smile as she fell away. Down down down deep into the blackness. She didnt wave or cry. She just fell. I jumped after her but i was stopped. I watched her fall with her eyes blank and heart frozen. I screamed out, but not a sound came from my lips. My body felt as if it were going to burst with such pain. Screaming as loud as I could inside did noting at all on the outside. I couldnt do anything but watch. Watch her fall down. My heart was being toren appart, inside out.

The sun began to kiss the mountains so far away. The cool wind blew over my witherd body as i sat there, rocking back and forth on a little rocking chair. The cold air was gently knawing at my arm as a began to become aware of my surroundings. As I slipped back into reality I realized that night was comming which ment the darkness would prevale. I tried to raise out of the chair but my body was so fagile it would not support my weight. I called out but no one heard. Fear started to grasp at my throat. It was beginnign to get a breath down my weary throat. The sun was dissapearing into the land as the darkness began to swallow the world. My sight began to fade again. Fade to the darkness that lie within.

A drop of life fell from my finger tips, staining the floor on impact. A kiss of death was upon me. I saw a dark angel float infront of me dressed in black. As i stand in my little room with my one candle burning in the corner i saw the moster floating with one reason for life. Death. All i was able to see for a face under his cloack was gnarled teeth covered with flesh. Death was upon me. I stand there with my broken wings lye dead on the floor. Human i shal remain forever. My sword raised and eyes locked my heart stopped for a moment. I saw my life my love. Then they all slipped back away into my mind as the abomination hurled its dark body at me sword aimed for my throat. With in a moment it was over. No words spoken. Just a sigh of relife. Time stopped as the monster came at me. I saw anger and pain run through his veins. But with a single move my sword impaled his body.

"event","Okay so im sittin here on the computer once again going to type out every......well most feelings that are going through my head right now. Some of them well...lets just say i prefer to keep bottled up inside of my head. I dunno theres just so much that i should get out but i dont want to let it out cauz i know that ppl will get hurt in the process and i dunno maybe its just not worth the time of my day. I dunno.

But to better things. Had an alright day today. Wasnt all bad but wasnt all good. Most was good thou. Woke up bout 10ish put some work clothes on and went and helped my mom do some yard work and such til bout 12:00 or 1. Some where around there. then came back home and sat on my arss. Watched bits and peices of movies played my brothers gameboy. Not a whole lot. Bout 5ish went back to my parnetns house for some dinner. It was great. Had a dish that i really like. Its beef with shoui sauce or how ever yuou spell it and ginger and yah and shugar and yah it was great with some rice and mixed veggies. Was really happy. Thats like a comfort dish for me. And then yah came back home and...what did i do. I hung out with the friend that is here. Um went to mc deez with her and got her food with her money lol. Huray for discounts then watched blade with her and her mom. Its a really good movie. I wanna watch number 2. And yah that has pretty much been my day. Very uneventful, but was really pleased with what did happen. Though after doing yard work and such i have decided that i am goign to go out and buy myself a new back cauz mine is broken. lol.

Oi and im super stoaked going to get myuself a new guitar soon. Get like almost $300 to myself this week and my next paycheck shjould be enough to get it. Its only about $420. So getting there. well unless the sale price is off it or it has been sold. oh well see what happens right.

Now that i think about it i guess i did have an alright day...but there is one thing that keeps nagging at me. Lonliness. I dunno i guess i should jsut surround myself with my friends and try not to be off alone. Hope that it doesnt get to me. oh well just try and be happy i guess. Still got all the ppl out htere that love me. And emz thnx everyting that you do means alot to me. I just want you to know that. You are someone that is really special to me and i dont wanna see you hurt or ever cry okay. I love to see you happy and smile. Life isnt all that bad. Think of the better times. Lol think of me and matt lol. Love you lots. 

Have a good one

"event","Well as pessomistic (i know i cant spell) as i want to be about to day, and probably could be, im going to bring out the good of it.

To start it all off i woke up at about umm....lets say 10:45? Some where around there. Doesnt matter too horribly much. all that really counts was that church started at 11:15 and if i was going to make it in time with having a shower i would have to rush or try and get a ride. Well..no ride for me. So i blasted some music (finch) and ran like a mad man. I SS&S'd well minuse the poo. oh and that means Sh...pooed showered and shaved. Gelled my hair put a touque on and hopped on my bike and peddled like a mad man to church. Amazingly enough i made it there on time. well sort of they were into one song. Anyways not that it really matteres. Had an up lifting time there. Went back home after talking to a few ppl that i havnt seen in awhile and sat on my arss until bout 4ish. Went to my parents house had a great time there. Spent time watching my bros play diablo 2 and takled with my parents for a bit. Had a great ham dinner with my family and my grand parents and then came back home. Then unexpectedly the ppl that im staying with came home, wernt supose to be back til tommorow, and i hung out with them and such watched a movie, league of extrodinary men and now im on here writing this out for the whole world to see.

And now im askin myself why do i do this every day. No im not suicidal. Have already been there and figured that its probably jsut as stupid..no it is jsut as stupid as doing any sort of drug or drinking or anyting like that. Its really not worth the time of my day. But i dunno i just get depressed so quickly. Maybe i just have like permenant male PMS or someting liek that. It just gets to me that i go through every day hoping that there would just be someting more. Something more than the usual every day sort of thing. I dunno maybe its just one of those days....that turns into being every day but i guess i just feel alone. I just want to not have to worry about the world. Or worry about school or anything like that. I wish i was just able to jump right into being a graphics artist and get a job and do what i want to do. I dont want to have to worry about when can i actually go to school. How will i get the money and if i take out a student loan or some sort of loan, which looks very likely at this point and time, how will i pay it back? I dunno i know things will get better and not all days will be boring or uneventful or whatever. That there will be amazing days. But i want every day to be an amazing day. I want to wake up excited to go and do whatever i wanna do. 

Huray for complaning..oh well. I wanna be in penty right now. I miss not being able to see everyone there. But then again i would miss ppl here too. Im so torn. Blah. The human mind, so complicating yet so easy to undersatnd. I dunno im retarded. I wish i knew what i was supose to do. Where i am supsose to go. What i am supsose to do. Ahh im done i think. Enough complaning for one day. I love all of my friends out thre who are reading this. I am here for you always and forever, all you need to do is say hey i need to talk and i'll be there for you.

Have a good one"

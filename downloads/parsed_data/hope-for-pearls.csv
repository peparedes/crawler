AND I MISS MY HUSBAND :( a lot. and his best friend buuuuurhenny. and going to the movies and gkhadlkghaldkgh. ahahaha i miss hearing ""i love my wiiiiiihfe"" 

and i miss me and tarsi going everywhere together and never ever ever being apart. and everyone being jealous because were awesome and joined forces out of nowhere and blew everyone out of the water with our superiority. ahahah right. 

and the fucking diner sessions were always sick even though we were always like ""fuck a diner"" but always ended up there because were awesome and we just bring it everywhere we go with us and made the best of everything.

and i miss my backyard bonfire sessions and everyone being cool with eachother and it was so non drama. and every FUCKING time i read something about how ""ron and angel showed up and.."" that makes me remember all the awesome shows and awesome times this past year had. hi um jack getting naked at my house was pretty much the fucking funniest thing ever. apart from miss drunkassbitch at brigantine falling out of a chair with her super cool 5th grade ponytail. 

blahblah whatever everything happens for a reason. and atleast i can look back on it and smile and remember all of it. cos it was all awesome. and i love my friends and everything we did together this year. galkdhgl we seriously need to get back to that shit. im gonna have an old school kickass VIP party. were in serious need of one of them. let me know what dates good for people so i can get the approval and start saving up for the keg OH SHIT!?

"event","oi. tonight i was so overwhelmed by things i just totally crashed. im still drunk right now but i felt the need to let it out while my eyes are sort of able to open. i thought about my poppop and how we always used to go to the phillies games together tonight, so icalled my sister to say hello and the next thing i know shes got my in hysterics about him. then the next thing i remember im talking to my dad getting into this huge fight about everything thats been happening lately...

anyway. im sorry to everyone who was witnessing that. i dont know where it came from, its not like me to display that in public, im completely humiliated, and i suck.

"event","went to some hard core show last night, and i...being the epitomy of hard core, stood [okay, hid...] near the wall all night. and i have bruises all over my feet from it. blech. staying home would have been fine....


BUT. i did meet taras little friend and decided i just love him. and were soulmates. i figured id write about that since i know tara will. hah!

i left my flipping apron and workpants in that dumb bitch's car, so she needs to come pick me up and bring them to me. stupid bitch not only takes up all my free time, but steals my clothes too.

lala im in a funk today................... lots of things on my mind. i wrote for a good 3 hours last night, about everything thats been going on and about how im confused and crazed and blah blah. nobody understands anything, bascially because i dont talk to anyone, but more so because i know when i do talk about things people are so quick to judge that it really isnt worth bringing up. nobody really knows about your life but you anyway. and nobody really knows about your relationships and people in your life, but you... because things people do in privacy and things people do in front of their friends are two completely things. anyway...

big things happening tonight? im working until close-whos picking me up?"

"event","ive had a hectic week thats for sure. my attorneys been breathing down my neck because of inconsiderate people saying inconsiderate things to poor defenseless children. and then expecting a settlement in my seperation. hah. 

good news though, my blahniks were delivered this morning [thanks to alfred for picking them up for me, youll have a nice m3 in your stocking or something] so now i have some strappy sandals for the show tonight. and my chanel bikini is on its way, 





and so is my perfect body.

[and now that we know this entry is bullshit, lets continue.] 

this week was really tiring. worked all week early as hell to like 3 or 5 pm it was kind of relieving to be back but i dont want to there so much. tonights the last show or whatever so i guess i wasted my time but whatever the wedding is still on. this is my happy optimistic attitude can you tell yeah didnt think so. la la la tara is funny she makes me laugh when she gives me her house number and then tells me to call her cell phone because she didnt think of that i have nothing to say obviously i just feel like typing.

all of my friends need to get laid ASAP so they will stop asking me funny questions. just kidding the questions make me laugh, and i like answering them. so really all of my friends need to get laid ASAP so i have things in common with people for once. HAH. oh i crack myself up okay i hate you all bye now."

"event","i got fired from COACH today for my truck not working. i had to get my job back at coffee works. 

im fucking tired of my life being this way and the last thing i wanted was to end up there. but guess what.

this is my life. 

i am the most miserable person ever right now.

ive been so optimistic for the past couple months and i felt like if i just keep up the positivity everything will work itself out. well look where it got me. into a fucking accident, out of 2 jobs, back into one that i ran from, broke, lonely and back to a person that EVERY TIME I GET AWAY FROM, i end up right back here.

every time.

why do i even bother sticking up for myself and telling him i dont want him? every time i just end up going back because its the only thing thats consistent. 

[....ly making me feel like shit.]"

Jesus went to Martha's house and hung out with her and her sister, Mary.  Martha kept busy, trying to serve Him, while Mary just sat at His feet and listened.  Martha was upset that Mary was just sitting around, but Jesus said, ""You are worried and troubled about many things.  But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her"".

Application to me:
Jesus preferred the heart of Mary over the busyness of Martha.  Mary chose the better part-sitting at His feet.  How often do I get caught up at CRU making sure 'everything is going right' and working too hard to pay attention to Jesus?  And in my daily life, so often I'm working for things that can be taken away from me, instead of working towards and paying attention to the things that are eternal.  Jesus prefers a heart like Marys...to 'be still and know..."""

"event","This morning I read John 20.  My summary of it is this: After Jesus died and was placed in the tomb, on the third day Mary Magdalene went to see Him.  When she didn't find Him there she was upset.  But then Jesus appeared to her in the doorway.  She didn't recognize Him right away, but when she did, she went and told the others what had happened, and they sought Him also, and believed.  HE IS RISEN!

This is what God showed me in this story:  Many times we when we seek the Lord we look for Him in a certain place.  When we don't find Him where we expect Him to be, we get upset.  But God ALWAYS reveals Himself in an even BETTER way, a way we would never expect, but it is always in our best interest, though we may not recognize it right away.  But like Mary Magdalene did, how many times do we go and tell others what the Lord has shown us so that they may seek Him, believe, and enjoy the blessings of the Lord?"

"event","I think the Lord is telling me to not go on my trip.  I have been planning this for SO LONG, and have been looking forward to it for months, but I don't think I'm supposed to go.  First, the plans that I originally made fell through: Mandy was going to come, now she's not.  I was going to stay with my friend, Dan, but couldn't get ahold of him.  Was going to stay at my Grandparents, but they'll be busy.  And was going to stay in Salt Lake with my cousin, but he'll be out of town.  SO, being clever I changed my plans, and decided to stay in some hostels in San Fran and LA, and just cruise around by myself.  But my mom called tonight and told me she didn't want me doing that.  As much as I hate her trying to ruin my life because she still has some power over me since I owe her money, I decided I can't lie to her about not staying in a hostel, and the point of going on my road trip was to do random stuff like that and make it a cheap trip. So staying in hotels would defeat the purpose, and be less fun.  Also, the trip keeps getting delayed because of a project at work that just DOESN'T END.  I was going to leave today, but Jake was coming into town, so I postponed it till tomorrow.  But this project at work hasn't gotten finished, and I wanted to see Jake more, so I decided to leave Friday instead.  Well, now I really want to hang out with Jake more, and am having a lot of fun hanging out with that group again.  Plus, there's so much going on with church activities that I was upset because I was going to miss it if I left....like the potluck at Jesus Seekers, and helping with the Christmas dinner at church.  If I stay, I can do those things, hang out with Jake more...even possibly have him meet Jason and Lisa, AND finish the bathroom project (which I REALLY want to get done).  I can still not work for 2 weeks, and I'm saving money since I wont be spending so much on gas.  I don't get to see Dad or Jacquie or Arizona, but someday I will.  I could go to Corvallis for Christmas, since that sounds like a ton of fun... the whole family together again.  Plus I can still go to Portland to see Susan for New Years...like I have for the last three years.  Heck, I could go to the retreat if I wanted to. Probably wont though.  A road trip by myself sounds like a blast, but it's almost a relief thinking about NOT going.  I've been looking forward to a vacation since I haven't had one really since last Christmas break...but staying here and playing sounds like a GREAT vacation.  I wonder what's up with this Jake thing.  I can't get over the weird feelings I have towards him.  I can't decide what it is I'm feeling, it's a new one that I'm not used to.  I haven't seen him in over a year, and have talked to him once during that time, but seeing him now makes it seem like we've been hanging out for years, and like we're close buddies.  I'm interested to 'test out the waters' now...to see what's going on.  The next two weeks should reveal stuff, I'd think.  Well, I gave God this trip, and He's definitely doing something with it.  I've been concentrating on giving more to Him, and me not dealing with it, since He ALWAYS gives me more than I hope for.  So by not wanting me to go on this trip He's got something better in store for me.  What could be better than a 2 week, 5 states, solitaire, road trip?  I guess we'll see.  Pearl necklace."

"event","Well, lately I've learned a few things. 

One is that I keep God's abilities in a box.  Not God, I know that He is over all things and that He has the control...but I rarely trust His abilities to get things done right, or to get them done without me.  This is good to realize so that I can let Him change this in me, but it's tough because I like to have control.  I know that's dumb because God can obviously do a better job with my life than I can, and He's never let me down.  So why am I so stubborn?  Beat's me.  Time for another ""God rearranging Courtney"" session.

Also, I've learned that my verbal communication and my non-verbal communication suck at working together.  There are a lot of things that go on in my head, then I only let some things out of my mouth, and people often don't get the whole picture.  And latley it has ticked some people off, without me knowing (since I can hear what goes on in my head and it all makes sense to me).  

I've also realized that it's tough for me to let people love me.  I dwellt on this for a while, asking the Lord what it meant, why I think it, and what I should do with it.  I think maybe it's because, in my family, it's as if they love each other because of the things they do...their 'works'.  So to get other people to love me it takes a lot of effort, so they shouldn't start to love me because if I get used to their love, and I slack off then I will lose it and get hurt.  Then I thought---is this how I see God's love?  Because I know He loves me for me, not because of my works, but what I hear (maybe that's it...maybe I HEAR it because that's what I'm FOCUSING on) is that God loves me how I am, but He doesn't want me to stay that way...He wants me to be Just Like Jesus (Max Lucado, Just Like Jesus).  So does that mean I would disappoint Him if I stopped working on trying to become like Jesus?  Wait, why am I trying to be like Jesus? Isn't it God's job to do that?  I just have to be here and available.  This reminds me of what my sister said about starting to have a relationship with my dad...she doesn't want to because she's not ready for the effort it's going to take.  I didn't understand what she's talking about until now.  With my mom's side of the family it seems like it DOES take effort...but not with my Dad's. No matter what, they'll love me.  I hardly talk to that side of the family, but when I do, they are there with open arms.  I wonder if this is why I feel like I have to become SO SUCCESSFULL...because then my family will still love me.  

This all came up after Bible Study at Jesse ""Power Washin'"" Banks' house...Afterwards Orange Hat Dave came up to me and told me he loved me and gave me a hug...for no reason.  I know other people have said that to me, but this time it really affected me.  It was hard for me to believe, but the way he said it made me think that he really does...and he would no matter what I did.  And I know I'm not a very compassionate person, I've been told this recently, and it's tough for me to love others, for the fear of being hurt and for the effort it will take.  But also, because I don't let people love me.  It's starting to make sense.  Latley I've realized how I need to love others like Jesus loved others, no matter what, and it's SO HARD TO DO.  I'm pretty conditional with my love.  This revelation changed my whole perspective on my relationship with God and other people.  It's weird how i've always known this...but it's actually being applied to me now. God's timing is so weird...you'd think He'd have STARTED with this one.  What was He THINKING. (lol)

I'm so excited for my trip.  I'll probably postpone it another day because I have so much to do, and I want to hang out with Jake again.  I kinda still have a crush on him.  It's been a year and 3 months since I last saw him, and only talked to him probably twice since he left, but he's so much like my brother that it's tough not to like him (I always said I'd marry someone like Adam).  I think I'm over the Dustin thing.  I've been trying to not have a crush on him, because I know he's ""not it"", and I've known that for a while, but he's sure fun.  It's just been too much of an emotional roller coaster with him (not knowing what he's thinking but trying to read his 'signs'), so I'm giving up, and going to be his buddy.  That's all I want anyways. Good, now that's settled, I can move on.

Going to ""Christmas dinner"" with my mom and bro tomorrow.  I wonder how that will be.  I dread conversations with my mom because I always end up saying too much...It's like I think she'll understand me if I explain what's going on in my life, but she never does, she just somehow turns everything around to me blaming her for life.  So I guess I just can't say anything about what God's teaching me.  I don't know why, but she thinks that if I have problems and am dealing with them with God, then it was HER fault because of how she raised me, or it's because I'm ""just like my father"".  It's too bad she thinks that it's not normal to have problems...that's the biggest problem ever.  And it's a good thing that God knows we have problems and loves us enough to help us with them.

Point in all this: Jesus rocks."

"event","I was just thinking about how, in the last couple of weeks, I remembered how AWFULLY I treated my dad when I was growing up.  My mom used to have me get on the phone with him and would say the most nasty things anyone would ever say to anyone.  And when I was there visiting I was such a little terror.  Especially to my step-mom.  Those poor people.  And now... after all I did to them and the things I said to them, they love me so much, and treat me like I mean the world to them.  Then there's my mom.  Who I know I was awful to, also.  I said horrible things to her, too, and treated her like dirt, too.  But I've turned out fine, and I'd think I'd be a good kid to brag about.  I've worked so hard to be a 'prized child', one that she can be proud of, and it's still not enough.  I'm still not good enough.

Her loss, I guess...
I'm good enough for Jesus."

"event","I just watched the movie ""Raising Helen"".  Helen is a girl who has a lot going for her, then her sister dies and leaves her three children to raise.  Helen's life changes dramatically (for the worst in her opinion), and Helen feels that having to raise the children has ruined her life.  Watching her go through that made me cry--it felt like it really hit home.  When the movie was over I started bawling...that's how my mom feels about me, about my siblings.  She's even told me that.  I remember when I was 9 or 10, my mom said something about her not having any friends or a social life because she had us kids.  And then a couple years ago when she wrote me that letter saying how she wishes she could take break from being my mom for a while.  And how she uses the lines ""I'm the one who had to get up in the middle of the night when you kids got sick"" and ""I'm the one who spent my time and went to your school events"" to let me know that she's a better parent than my dad, as if it was an obligation.  It's no wonder I had no self-esteem, and why I have to work on it everyday.  My whole life I've always been the ""goody two-shoes"", making sure to do everything ""right"", being the good girl, and over acheiving in order to impress my family, as if that would make them love me more...or at least continue to love me.  What would happen if I messed up? My mom would stop loving me.  Is that how I treat relationships too? Is that why I act obsessively?...Because I'm afraid of losing them. 

Interesting...this is what Teresa has been discovering about her relationships with her parents...and because she thought she had to work in order to gain the love of her parents, she treated God the same way.  But when she realized that God loves her no matter what, it changed her relationship with Him completely.  I know God loves me, even when I mess up...ESPECIALLY when I mess up.  I know I don't have to DO anything for His approval, but I like to.  

This is obviously affecting me...so, God, what am I supposed to learn from this?"

"event","So it was a pretty intense/emotional weekend, and it's only Friday night.  It was fun though. So, lately I've decided that I shouldn't be single, but God has other plans for my life, and a couple nights ago I told Him what I thought about that.  Like in my last journal entry I mentioned His reply was ""I am God and you are not"", well, I guess He just likes to rub things in.  A couple weeks ago one of my best friends got engaged. Then I realize that my roommate is always out with different guys because she always gets asked out.  Then a good friend came to me to talk about his feelings for another good friend of mine...he said things that all girls dream about having a guy say about them, and it 1) made me excited for my friend, 2) made me jealous yet again, and 3) gave me hope that someday some guy will be saying things like that about me.  It's not THAT big of a deal, I mean, I'm content single, but just like any 22 year old girl I obviously long for my Prince.  Anyways...then today at women's Bible Study, I got there and there were a few of the regular girls not there and a few new ones...and after I looked around I realized I was the only one in the room not married and not with a baby!!  I laughed and shared God's joke with everyone. It cracked me up.  But God reminded me that He's all I need, and I need to be joyful about that...GET...I GET to be joyful about that.  heck, I don't have the drama of a husband or boyfriend.  PTL.

Well, talked to Cameron tonight.  He took, without asking, 11 of my beers and drank them.  That was the last straw. I talked to Dave and Luke about the situation and came to the conclusion that he's old enough to know the difference between right and wrong, and he was being very disrespectful by the choices he is making.  So I told him he had until the end of the month to find somewhere else to live.  He smiled and said thank you, it didn't bother him right now.  Well, maybe it would if he knew how much he was hurting me in the process...but that's what I get for having too big of a heart.  I did realize in this, though, that I was treating him how my mom treats me....by manipulating him because I know he needs me, so I was using that to try to get him to change his life.  I was going to say he needed to clean up his act and get enrolled in school or else he needed to find somewhere else to live.  It hit me really hard when Luke pointed that out, because that is one of the main reasons why I am detatching from my mom, because she tries to do that with me.  Well, at least it came to my attention and the Lord can help me do something about it.

Dave came to town today. Got to see him for only a second. But it's always nice to see him.  He makes me smile.

"event","Man, had an interesting night last night.  I didn't notice how much stress I had, but it all came out last night.  Yes, I was PMSy so that didn't make anything easier,but it was a needed venting moment...time to express my true thoughts to the Lord and tell Him how I felt about things right now.  I went for a drive late last night because I was SO TICKED OFF and I didn't know why.  But I got in my car and just drove.  The first 2 songs on the radio answered some questions for me, but then I turned it off and told God what I thought about His decisions relating to my life.  After I was done venting I let Him tell me His side of the story...which was pretty much ""I am God, and you are not"".  He reminded me about the rest of the 22.5 years that He's been in control of my life and hasn't screwed up, and I realized that I'm the one getting in the way...again.  So, I felt better, felt the stress leave my back, and came home.  Cameron was outside smoking, and came over to ask what was up.  I told him what I had just done, knowing he wouldn't understand, but figured he'd just listen and go with it.  But instead he mocked me.  I couldn't take it. I just walked away.  He doesn't need to agree with me, but doesn't need to make fun of me.  But I know people have been persecuted more than that, so I'm okay with it.  I'm JOYFUL that I can be persecuted for the Lord.  So, laying in bed, I came upon a decision of what to do with Cameron.  But, since I was tired and cranky I decided to wait to say something until I was more level-headed.  Today I thought about it somemore, and I think I will give Cameron the ulitmatum.  All he does is smoke, drink, and play video games, and I don't want my house to welcome that kind of life...by allowing him to continue to live like that is only hurting him.  So I'm going to give him one month to get his act together or he needs to find somewhere else to live.  By getting his act together I mean taking his placement test and getting officially enrolled as a student at RCC, quit drinking--here or anywhere.  If he's not addicted like he says, then it shouldn't be a problem.  And find another hobby so he's not playing video games all the time.  It's okay for a little bit, but not 5-8 hours a day.  There are better things he can do with his time.  Luke Cronin has showed an interest in hanging out with Cam, so he can go hang out with Luke.  I don't want him out in the cold, alone during the holidays, but it's his choice.  If he decides to let his pride and stubbornness kick in, then he will end up that way.  But if he chooses to use this opportunity to better himself and his life, then he is perfectly welcome to stay.  Lord, please give me the patience for Cameron that you have for me EVERY DAY."

"event","I've pretty much done nothing today.....this is GREAT!  How often does THIS happen?  Well, actually, it's happening more and more, I'm not sure if I like it.  I've taken the step to ""simplify"" my life, and it's strange not being busier than I can imagine.  I feel almost like a slacker.  But I'm sure it could be worse.  

This morning I got up early to practice guitar...played out on the roof, I love it out there. My hands were frozen, but it's nice being outside.

Was ticked at Cameron and sorta Michaela.  They were out late last night dancing.  Cameron told me this morning that he's smoking again.  GOSH what is WRONG with him?  And I completely was judgemental to him and Kaela this morning and was convicted of it during Bible Study today. So afterwards I went to BBV and apologized to Cameron for my thoughts towards him.  Don't know if he understood how tough it was for me to ask for forgiveness for something he didn't even know I did (judged him), but someday it might means something to him.  I still want to talk to Kaela.  I'm just concerned about her testimony, I don't want to judge her, but I don't want to sit here thinking things without saying anything to her.

Bible Study was good.  I told my story about my back, they loved it of course.  I love that group, I'm so glad I went there, I didn't know anyone, but now I feel connected to them.  And I stepped way out in faith to play for them and they are so supportive, even though I know I stink at guitar.  It's nice to have that support group away from the regular group.  It's kind of like my ""thing"" that no one else goes to, time to get away and hear other people's lives and what the Lord is doing in them.  Today we read Romans 2 and it talked about being judgmental when I'm doing the same things.  And how God is patient with us when we continually mess up. And how there's a difference between knowing the facts about the Lord and actually KNOWING the Lord....reading it versus living it.  It was all exactly what I needed to hear, the Lord is amazing like that.

Came home and dinked around for a while.  Practiced guitar for about 1.5 hours....then JAMES CALLED FROM PERU!! It was so exciting.  He's doing well, learning Spanish pretty quickly. He's going to start teaching a Bible Study, someone will translate for him.  How cool is that.  He's going to be the coolest Grandpa ever because he's an amazing storyteller and has so many stories to share!  Man, God bless James :)

Mom didn't come to the Bible Study today, I emailed her and called her to invite her...no reply.  But I'm not surprised...she was ticked last time I invited her to something because I don't know why...like she was obligated to come or something.  Last time she came to something I invited her to (wine tasting) we had a blast, so I don't know why she's like that.  Is it bad to get a hard heart toward my mom?

Man I have a lot to say today.  Probably because I've been alone all day and need someone to talk to, LOL.

I don't know what I think about this cute boy situation.  Seems like everytime he makes plans with me something comes up...getting the hint Courtney?  I mentioned it jokingly, and it doesn't seem like he's doing it on purpose, but it makes me feel lame because I get stood up.  But I'm not dwelling on the thought of it, I have so many other things I can do that it's not like I'm left lonely.  Thank God I went through that HUGE lesson a couple years ago about depending on the Lord instead of people to make me happy, because this would've just killed my self-esteem.  So now I just think...huh--good time to spend with Jesus! YES!  I LOVE getting stood up! :)

Can't wait to go on my road trip.  Mandy's not coming with me, which sucks, but I have enough stops on the way that I wont be driving forever by myself.  Plus I enjoying hanging out with me and my imaginary friends, we're fun!  It will be exciting to see Bay and Peg in Phoenix, and my old neighbor Dan in Bakersfield, and my grandparents in Palm Desert.  I might swing up to Utah on the way back to see my second cousin, and then possibly stop by Winter Conference in Spokane for New Years Eve...but we'll see how the weather is and how much money I have.  That would be a cool trip though....six states in 2 weeks.

He taught me some worship songs on the guitar, and I know that was good for him because he has not been walking with the Lord lately.

GOT TO WATCH THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE! (Gosh, Courtney, no one could ever know that)(Napoleon Dynamite) Went to the cute boy's house and watched it and had yummy Mac 'n Cheese goodness.

I vacuumed my car today, thought it would make it smell better, but it didn't.  I just need new carpet. Oh well, must wait...too broke.  

It was funny--at church tonight Crystal came up to me and mentioned my back.  I was confused as to how she knew, but I guess after those people left me, they went and told the whole conference about it.  Then Big Dave told freeborn the story was about me, then Freeborn told people.  So how awesome is that that word about Jesus's miricle is spreading so quickly.

And I've been able to tell a lot of people the story: CARL, Jasmine, Cameron....people who know how much my back bothered me, and they got to hear how awesome God is.  I can't tell my family, though.  I lied to them and told them it was better a while ago, Mom especially.  She wanted me to quit Blockbuster because of it, so I told her it was better.  BUT NOW IT IS! I'm still being careful though.

AND Cameron is in the process of registering for classes at RCC. YAY JESUS! I'm stoked that he's taking that step, it's tough when you've been out of school for 11 years, well, I'd imagine so.

A cute boy and I went to lunch yesterday.  We flirt a lot, and joke about flirting a lot, and he commented on how it was a good first date. Kind of a joke, but maybe not. Don't know, but he's a good guy, I could hand out with him more.

A friend just called (can't say who yet) and she got engaged this morning!!!!!!!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!! I bawled. She asked me to be in her wedding.  Dang it! I'm NEVER getting married...you know what they say, ""once a bridesmaid never a bride"".  Oh well, I can't wait. I'M SO HAPPY FOR HER.  It seems like God is really in it this time.

I'm broker than a joker right now. My dad forgot he was supposed to give me money for bills, so I overdrafted like 6 times this month. Ouch.  But It's fixed now.  It's nice trying to struggle like a real college kid finally.  It's good for me.  One of these days I may be forced to handle my money better...I'm getting there.

"event","Well, I made it about 30 during my Non-verbal Comm assignment of not talking, listening to people talk, listening to music without words, or reading.  That was interesting.  I got a lot done though.  I went through a bunch of crap I had stored in Jenna's room...have a big pile for Goodwill.  And took off the wallpaper in the bathroom. I'm not going to finish that project for a while because I need to figure out what to do about the drywall I removed, not knowing it was important. Hee hee, oh well.  

So today, since I was sick of being silent and in the house, I walked to the park, hoping to find Cameron and Kyla down there.  I didn't see them, so I walked up the trail a bit to sit by the river.  For this assignment I was supposed to listen to the sound around me.  I thought it would be a peacefull place to sit and listen for God.  I closed my eyes to concentrate, but all I could think of was that worship song that goes ""Because of Jesus I am restored"".  Couldn't get it out of my head.  Then I opened my eyes and turned around.  A guy walked up and said Hi.  Since I wasnt' supposed to talk I just smiled.  He didnd't leave, instead he introduced himself.  As to not be rude I decided I should talk to him.  He said he had seen me thinking hard and wondered what I was thinking.  I told him I was trying to hear God.  He said God had sent him to the park, but didn't know why.  He was on his way to his car to leave when he saw me.  We talked for a bit, he's from GP but was down for a youth conference at Rivergate.  Then a girl and guy came up behind us.  They knew him.  They introduced themselves, then the girl asked if I had back pain.  I said yes (my  back was actually in very much pain at that moment, but that's normal).  She said God told them to come over and pray for my back, and asked if she could.  I said yes.  She put her hand on my back and started praying.  At first I was a little freaked, but realized that I had never prayed for healing of my back before.  And I've heard of so many miracle healings, I dont' know why I haven't.  Anyways, as she prayed my back got warm....and the pain ceased.  They walked away, stoked that my back was better. I was crying.  I sat for a bit, and the first thought that entered my mind was ""Because of Jesus I am restored"".  PTL.  YES SUH!  I walked home thinking...the pain is going to come back...it's just a coincidence.  But it's been 8 hours and no pain.  

Too excited about the Lord...couldn't stay silent...had to quit my 2 days of silence.  It's worth it.

I'm bugged about Cameron.  Picture this:  he's 30, doesn't have a home, doesn't have insurance on a beat-up car that has to be hotwired to start, has no college education--but could have a fatty grant for being a single parent if he would just apply, works for an hourly wage at a movie store hoping to get 40 hours a week....I offer him my home for free so he can get back on his feet, buy $50 worth of nictotine gum so he can quit, yet he still smokes, stays up till 2 or 3 am drinking and playing video games.  I just want to tell him all this so he can see how pathetic he is.  He says that no matter what he will NOT fail as a father, because ""if you fail as a parent you fail at life""--is what he says.  Well, as soon as Kyla figures out that he's not even close to being as amazing as she thinks he is, then she's going to have little or no respect for him, and will have failed as a parent.  I pray all the time that he will realize this, but he might need to be told.  I'm considering telling him that if he doesn't go and apply for school by the end of the week then he needs to find somewhere else to live.  I don't want to be assisting his lazyness when there's so much more he could be doing.  He already broke the ""2 beer"" rule, even AFTER I made it clear that it ticked me off.  He's coming to church in the morning with me, well, so he says. That's a start."

Almond Joy Mocha and spilled it in my laptop keyboard and ruined it.  Not pleasant--I really wanted that drink!  Then on Thursday night I filled up a HUGE cup full of water to have next to my bed...knocked it over--it all spilled out onto the floor and my comforter.  THEN tonight I was at Red Robbin eating a delicious bass (actually-- it was a pork fajita) with Dave, and drinking a glass of water.  Dave sat there and stared at me for a second then went on to say ""I bet you can't make me smile"".  I decided I didn't care, I was enjoying my food to make the effort.  I picked up my glass of water to drink it, and, yep...dropped it.  It spilled all over the table and Dave.  He jumped up LAUGHING.  YEP---I WIN!  I swear I didn't mean to.  So after dinner we went walking around by the river and made out on the dock.  We visited Justin at American Eagle, and on the way back to my car we stopped at Dutch Bros.  I got some tea...it was SO hot I could hardly hold it and it even had 2 cups.  We hadn't even pulled away from the window and I spilled it in my lap.  OH THE PAIN.  It burned my inner thighs through my jeans!!  What is my problem, I don't know.  But I have small welts.  I should sue Dutch Bros....there's no warning saying it's HOT.  So, I'm grounded from handling any liquids for a while. Now I'm in Bend, about to go to sleep.  S'posed to get up and go to the gym in the am with Dave, but I forgot my charger for my phone, so I hope it doesn't die before morning.

Oh grrr, I talked to Cameron tonight.  He said he started smoking again. Not as much as usual, but he had 5 today.  I'm frustrated with him.  He's got so much potential but doesn't use it.  Except he gives good back massages, so think I'll keep him around."

But today when PJ prayed for him at church I just bawled.  I had realized, but hadn't actually thought much about, what a big part of my life James is.  He saved my life this summer.  I wouldn't have lasted without him.  He doesn't know about the suicide part to my summer, and what Mandy said to me up on the mountain about it.  When I called her to come get me, instead of saying ""oh Courtney, you'll be okay""  she got after me and said something to the affect of: ""what the hell are you thinking!!!.....James looks up to you and is in awe of how strong you are and how you keep going. He thinks you're great..."". Before she told me that I didn't know anyone looked up to me, I just thought everything was going wrong, and I was helping mess it up.  As an employee of mine James kicked butt.  Even with a manager as untrained and unknowlegable as I was, he was still loyal and the hardest worker I've ever met.  He saved me many times with work, including training the new painters, since I stink at teaching stuff that I don't know how to do.  But along with being a rockstar employee, he is also an angel the Lord sent in the form of a friend.  I'm the type of person that, when something happens, thinks of is as SUCH A BIG DEAL and it overwhelms me.  James seems to keep me grounded.  He calms me down and reminds me that whatever is going on is NOT why I'm here, and that the Lord's got in under control.  After Wednesday who's going to do that?  And whenever I meet a new guy, who's going to laugh at me when I immediately say I'm going to marry him?  James says I'm the sister he never had, and he says such awesome things about me that it makes me BEAM since I know my sister doesn't think that highly of me.  He's said what an awesome summer he's had working for me because of the things I've taught him, but I don't think he understands that he's the one that changed my life, not the other way around.  It reminds me of that song by Andy Griggs, ""She Thinks She Needs Me"", but obviously the opposite person singing, and not in the romantic way. So, not really like it at all, but it still has the same gist to it.  Anyways...what a blessing that guy James is.  He's made the impact the rest of us should strive to make...one that exudes Jesus.(Is exude a word? the right word?  well, I mean RADIATES, in case that's not the right word---James would know.  He's usually here to let me know if it's right or not. And even when it's not right he still understands me and lets me just keep talking).  I can't wait till he comes back so he can take me rock climbing some more.  I can't believe that guy can stand me for so long.  He's got the gift of patience...he deals with BOTH Mandy and I...FOR DAYS.  Man, a year ago today I didn't even KNOW him.  Weird.  See ya later, James.  You're a rockstar."

You really don't know me very well at all.  Your Dad would of understood, in
fact, he needed that program as much as anyone.  The numbers could have been
381 and 41!  Now, that would have been something to boast about.

I'm sorry you are sick. No, I didn't tell Dad that too.  I just know you 
better and know that you would've enjoyed the show...and I got up to make an

announcement, then later realized my zipper was down...you would've thought 
that was funny.  I also wanted you there to see why I love what I do.  You 
said I should quit being so involved in Campus Crusade, but if you would've 
seen last night I think you might have realized why I love being so 
involved.  I put that whole program on almost all by myself.  Our goal was 
100 people....over 380 people came, and over 40 marked on their card that 
they prayed to receive Christ because of it.  THAT is why I'm here.  I don't

think Dad can understand that because of where he is spiritually, but I 
think you can. So I just wish you could've seen why Campus Crusade is my 
life.  But I understand that you were sick, I'm glad Adam got to come. It 
was good for Alex to hear about Jesus, I'm sure.
Hope you get better soon,

"event","The following appeared in the Durham, NC local paper as a letter to the editor: 
 
Liberals claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war. They complain about his prosecution of it. One liberal recently claimed Bush was the worst president in U.S. history. 
 
Let's clear up one point: 
We didn't start the war on terror. Try to remember, it was started by terrorists BEFORE 9/11.  
Let's look at the ""worst"" president and mismanagement claims. 
 FDR led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us: Japan did.   From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost, an average of 112,500 per year. 
 Truman finished that war and started one in Korea.  North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost, an average of 18,333 per year. 
 John F. Kennedy started the Vietnam conflict in 1962.  Vietnam never attacked us. 
 Johnson turned Vietnam into a quagmire.  From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were lost, an average of 5,800 per year. 
 Clinton went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent.  Bosnia never attacked us. He lied, cheated, stole in office.  He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and did nothing.  Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions. 
 In the two years since terrorists attacked us, President Bush has liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Lybia, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot, and 
captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people.  We lost less than 600 soldiers, an average of 300 a year.  Bush did all this abroad while not allowing another terrorist attack at home.  
Worst president in history? Come on! 
 
The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, 
but... 
 
 It took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation. 
 We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records. 
 It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Teddy Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick. 
 It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in 
Florida!!!! 
 
Our military is GREAT! PASS IT ON."

"event","Tomorrow is the big day.  I'm not really stressing, but I'm excited, anxious, I guess a little nervous, and just in awesome wonder at how the Lord has pulled this event together.  I'm going through so much crap right now I KNOW He's present because I sure don't have the strength to go on with out Him.  I have awesome friends (MANDY) helping me out when I need it and praying for me, that's how I get through my days.  After College Works is finally over, and after this Andre Kole thing I'm going to need to take a break.  Don't know how, though.  I love CRU stuff, and I need to work, now that I'm going to start becoming more financially independant.  That's the other thing that's been going on recently.  I've realized how verbally and emotionally abusive my mom is.  I have a hand written letter she wrote me a couple years ago that tells me she wished she could take a break from being my mother.  I have emails from last summer that say that I'm a self-righteous little girl, and this weeks email says I'm not worth it to be helped and that I'm a spoiled little brat.  She told me on the phone on Sunday that my dad doesn't love me.  She also said that me working at Blockbuster and doing CRU stuff is worthless, because that's not why I'm here.  Yah right.  By the Lord giving CRU a $1500 check and bringing a co-worker into my life that I could introduce to Jesus, I'd say yes that is why I'm here.  SO, if I decrease contact with my mom I think I still have a chance of turning out somewhat sane.  I'm stoked to have Rick and Nancy in my life to give me a good role model of a godly relationship and life.  My dad rocks, though, just thought I'd throw that in. He holds no grudges against me from when I used to treat him like crap growing up.  So, overall, the Lord rocks.  And I'm surprisingly upbeat.  Pray for tomorrow.  I think a lot of non-Christians will be at the show.  It's definitely a bold outward expression of my belief since I've invited so many people.  I think satan tried to scare me when he made me think about how people might react.  But whatever, I know how Jesus is reacting and I like that better.  Now I'm so excited to go to bed, I've been looking forward to it all day!!"

You know, I am really proud of you and how you are continuing to live for
the Lord.  The baggage with your mom is tough...in most ways I would say
that you are going to need to continue to separate from her as much as you
can.  Scripture doesn't say for children to continue to be abused...that
isn't part of God's plan.  SO...I would encourage you to decrease contact
with her as much as possible...and definitely don't let her ""trap you into
coming to her level"" ...or even responding to emails such as the one you
sent me as an example.

In the meantime, Nancy and I want to take you out to eat with us...we talked
and wanted to do something special for you/with you...we both agreed that
spending some extra time with you was what we want to do most.  So, when
things settle down...schedule-wise, we'll do that ....

Tomorrow, the Kole event is the Lord's...so, take deep
breaths...relax...work (I know you will do that)...but, let all of the way
that the day goes, be the Lords....because that is the truth; that is, that
this event is His and under His control.  Absolutely every person that is
there, is who the Lord wants there.  And, the way that everything gets done,
is going to be done the way that the Lord wants it done.  We work-sow
seeds-plan-sweat-do, do, do...but the results and how people respond
spiritually is up to Him.  We are just His instruments. SO......I'm soooo
excited for tomorrow night :)

Love you in the Lord,
Rick n Nancy"

""FUNNY THING"", you sound just like your Dad. Are you keeping track?  How
many times was that now?   I don't know why I bother. If you can THINK you
can say ""A-hole"" to me and think it's okay, then calling you a little shit
is no big deal.  You disgust me.  Call your dad and get help from him.  You
and I just don't see life with the same value.  I might talk about my Mom
behind her back but I certainly would never talk to her like you've spoken
to me over the past months to her face.  I've provided you with health
coverage that will pay for Dr Col.  When you get out on your own you won't
have that.  Maybe you are right and it's time you carry your own loan for
school.  Get you Dad to carry your health insurance too.  It's his turn.
You'd have to pay the 2,000.00 deductible though.  You've had it too good
brat.  My fault I fear.  I thought I was loving you.

Take care of your own frickin back and your own frickin mind.  No child of
mine that I've given my life for will talk to me this way!  Funny thing!
Your Dad gets out of all the nights I spent pacing the floor when you were
sick or on a date or on first prom and he's flying the nation playing around
and I still am waiting for my time to have a life. 

I didn't 'play' brooke and you other two against your Dad and Jackie.  You
must remember something different....like Brooke talking shit about them.  I
remember you screaming because you didn't want to go visit.  You HATED
Jackie.  She told you you were boring because you were bored.  Stuff like
that.  You disliked her.  Somewhere along the line you've been brainwashed
and I don't care because you arent' worth it anymore you little spoiled
brat.  You think I'm gonna care if you can't pull yourself together  when
you talk so lowly of me and so highly about your whore father?  At least I'm
willing to talk the truth.  So shut the hell up and go read your bible.  IT
sure has done you a lot of good.  Funny thing, just like your Dad."

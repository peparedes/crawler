"event","im in a really weird ass mood the one were you think about everything you cant control and wish you could because if you could then you wouldnt feel weird about it anymore...i have been sitting here looking at peoples journals and people lives just seem to be better/more interesting then mine ...they party, go out, drink, have tons of friends of the oppisite sex everything that i feel like i dont do or have...i guess its not all that bad if i really broke it down and thought about shit but to sit here and write i have nothing to say...just boring, mundane, and or depressing...life just rediculous in general... thats all
on BRIGHTER note i got an icon its Dali's ballerina in death's head -heh sarcasm"

"event","for some reason i was thinking of when you were telling me that eric was like oh she is probably downstairs on her myspace like she lives for that shit and i chuckled because im at work and im on the phones and have been glued to the myspace screen for almost 45 minutes i clicked that off hella quick...and then i decided to write even though not much has been going on...i keep having these weird dreams like the one you were in rach with the pool and shit and last night i had one about binky and it makes me have all these weird feelings through out the day, about a fucking dream...oh well but i just saw the message you left me on myspace and how the ""eye"" thing made you smile it was awesome you know im a sucker for that shit, and your response to it made me smile too ""i'm glad that you have that going on "" hahah that was classic..oh so how i got in trouble at work on firday wasn't even my fault, turns out the lady just blamed it on me to not get in trouble with her boss but she got caught HAHA and this really cool attorney talked to my boss and sorted things out...of course my boss lady didnt say diddly to me in the apology department but at least she knows ya know?...my grandfather is only staying woth us for 11 more days my mom has a countdown he is mean and nasty and i know this is horrible but i wont be sad to see him go back to his house ...only four more weeks untill i get to spend soem time at the beach one of my favorite things to do during the summer i am having my own countdown for that...i have been dieting too it sucks going to bed hungry make you think of all the people who have to do that with out a choice every night...i didnt get to see binky this weekend hopefully this weekend i will though and thursday is payday wo0t!"

"event","so i woke up this morning to my dad in my room. he said it was 9:00.....and he was leaving for band practice. thats about all i heard. i had the covers over my head.
i think he stole my deodorant stick and threw it away. now i'm stuck with the nasty one that smell slike chlorine. its really disgusting......i'm starting to think that its better to smell like BO than that stuff.

so i woke up......and walked around the house in my underwear, air guitar star t-shirt, and my eskimo moon boots. nobody was home......so i took advantage of the moment.
it was kind of nice that my dad said goodbye before he left. normally i just wake up to an empty house on weekends.....i've kind of gotten used to it.

i grabbed the jar of peanut butter and a spoon, a package of cinnamon, blueberry, and strawberry pop tarts (even though i only ate one of the cinnamon pop tarts.) and i filled my nalgene bottle with grape juice. then i went up to my mom's room and watched mulan 2 and ate.
now i'm on my computer.....writing this. someone just imed me......and i dont' know who it is. i like it when people do that though. so...i encourage more strangers to IM me. i won't get mad or yell at u...i'll talk to u. i like talking to strangers. somehow.....they always have more interesting things to say then the people who i already know (besides jeph of course.....she's always a live wire.)

i should probably go put some pants on.

"event","i made myself my own personalized sweatshirt. i cut out some letters from a pair of green plaid pajama pants that i used to have and i stitched them onto my zip up hoodie. so it says bella<3
and i put my hello kitty shoelaces into the little string thingys for the hood.
next, i shall put ears on the hood, and it shall be my uber sweatshirt.

i like english. there's this new girl named elektra who just got placed in my english class. she's super cool looking. i think i'll have to get to know her. just cuz. 

i have a huge craving for jello....and those chocolate egg things.....


my eighth grade teacher died two days ago. friday afternoon....when i was in math.
she was also my 5th,6th, and 7th grade teacher and chorus director. *small school*
she meant a lot to me....my mom just told me when she picked me up from school. i cried so hard....
i don't know what to do right now. i don't know what to think. its all so insane. i wish she were still here. i can't even remember the last thing i said to her.
i can't help but wonder where she is now. i'm not a religious person..but i think my mother kind of is. so i asked her and she replied ""heaven"" which i don't believe...so i don't know what to believe.
it just doesn't feel real....
so we had two huge concerts for her this weekend. yesterday we practiced all day and then performed and ended at 10....then we performed again today at two.
at the first concert there was this kid that i know in the audience who i went to school with last year. he was so cute, he was sitting with his mom and just crying. it was sad....all the chorus members were crying on this one song....it was just super sad. after the show i saw him and gave him a hug. i've decided that i don't hate him. its weird though...afterwards my sister was talking to me in the car about how he had asked specifically about me to her  and how i was doing after ms.w's death and everything. i think i'll give him a hug in science tomorrow morning.
ai yai yai yai....
its all so insane. i've never had anyone truly special in my life die before. i don't know how to take it. i'm worried that i might get over it too easily or that i might be depressed about it for a million years. i'm worried i might break down crying any second in the hallway. i'm worried about what'll happen to the chorus and what will happen to all my friends who are still in school and who had her as a teacher. i'm scared because i don't know where she is right now. i just don't know what to do....i'm scared whenever i'm not crying and someone else is...because then i feel funny. 
this is such a slap in my face....a reality check....suddenly i've realized what is and isn't important in my life.
this is just too hard and real for me.....

"event","hmmm....about time i updated this bugger. 

well, i've been terribly busy with studying for school. 
i bombed my math exam, but i think i did well on my french and english exams. 
my history is......unknown. the essays i bombed though. those sucked. i didn't know much about the hebrew religion.....so i wrote like three sentences. ack. 

my computer's monitor is doing weird stuff. its twitching and going black at random moments. 

so, right now i should be celebrating. f-ing exams are over! omg! but i'm not. i'm typing in my online journal...listening to the strokes....eating goldfish....wearing ski goggles....

so at lunch, there was this one section where all the hot (except that loser hick who thinks he's cool because he plays guitar) guys with shaggy hair and whatev, passing around this gorgeous, black and white guitar and playing it. HOT!
i wish i had been over there. geez, this one guy...i think he's a senior. super hot. 
my friend david was walking down into town, and i was walking up to school. so we passed by eachother, and his hair was super hot. i stopped him and started talking to him and playing with his hair. he looked like conor oberst almost. YES!
david is hot. too bad we could never be. 

i forgot to drop off my history notebook again. now my teacher is going to kill me. hardcore. 
i'm not too worried though. which is weird. a week ago i would be flipping out going ""omg, turn the car around i have to go back and drop off my notebook!""
now i don't care. i'm mellow. it feels good. 

so, we had to do an oral presentation in p.e. about a sport. i chose synchronized swimming. and i guess we were supposed to have a visual reference....so everyone else brought posterboards with pictures and whatever...and i didn't have anything because i kind of didn't prepare for it. i just woke up this morning and was like ""oh....i have to do a report in pe. maybe i should look over my notes."" 
so when it was my turn to present, i decided suddenly that i would perform some of the synchronized swimming moves. so i got down on the ground and did a couple that i remembered vaguely and i came up with names for them off the top of my head. i was like ""this is the right angle position....*lies on ground with one leg straight up in the air* and this is the flamingo position *lies on stomach with one leg up in the air bent at the knee*""
so yeah....that was my visual reference. although i went over the maximum limit of 5 minutes....so i got a point off for that. i'm not too worried though. my written essay kicked ass, and thats worth 2/3 of my p.e. grade. 

yesterday i forgot the key to my house so i ended up going over to a friend of mine's house where i watched scream and scream 2. i made some instant ramen and shirley temples and ridiculed the movie and got grossed out at all the right places. then i just watched him play video games. he played some demo games (one was about a ball that u roll around and pick things up with. its insane....so is the intro) and then played jak 3, even though he'd already beat it. 
i had fun. can't wait till the get scream 3.

thats all. enjoy ur day. 
i'm gonnna go watch that sucky movie ""the village"" because i feel like it. 
i don't know....somedays u feel like watching life changing, amazing movies that get no credit at all, and then somedays u feel like watching crappy movies that are sold at blockbusters with crappy special effects or bad acting and who got a million dollars at the box office somehow. 

ZUT!"

i don't see how anyone could honestly spend so much time on their hair. i mean............i just wake up and go. *shrugs* 
there's this girl in my p.e. class and she was telling some other girl how she spends an hour in the bathroom just on her hair so she has to wake up at 5 in the morning. ai yai yai yai. 

yay! its 2005! i have no idea what i'm going to do.........now that its the new year and all. i should probably start on my p.e. essay about synchronized swimming. that would probably be good.......seeing as its worth a lot of my grade.....and i generally suck at p.e.......so getting a good grade on this would probably help. 

run by snow patrol is so stuck in my head.....i don't think i'll ever be able to get it out. i've been listening to it non stop on my computer. i've also been fast forwarding it so that he sounds like a chipmunk. 

i just took a shower yesterday but i smell bad. whats with that? will i ever win?
haha......i don't care really. i'm just staying home today.......alone. again. as always. 
yeah......i've gotten pretty used to waking up and finding nobody home. 

i have no food in my house. i'm so hungry. i just woke up at 12:15......major sleep in. but i can't go and get food cuz i don't have a ride into town. oh........and i also don't have any money. daaaaaaaaang.

the expressions on the faces of the girls in these pics kind of shows how i'm feeling today.

i really want to do something for new years. but i doubt i will. i'll probably just sit at home eating and watching television. i guess i sort of want to see the ball drop in new york........

i went shopping at wal mart and i got a pair of pants (i call them my sailor pants cuz thats what i thought of when i first saw them), a scarf (its super long and green. yay), a box of zebra cakes (they're my fav little debbie snack), a bottle of strawberry flavored water, chapstick, and a lemonade snapple. i was going to get a bulletin board for my room.......but i decided not to.

i went skiing today. that totally wiped me out, i'm tiredererer than....everybody. 
skiing kind of sucked because all the trails were closed because the snow is being stupid and not falling. 
i got home to find people at my house. *gaspshock* that never happens. 
so, yeah. and then this girl that i used to go to school with came over and was like ""hi, i'm here to hang out with you so entertain me biatch.""
i didn't know what to do.....so i ate my sister's sushi (she made it. u so rock!) and then did a little dance for her. she wasn't too thrilled, so i gave her a box of chocolates that my aunt gave the entire familia (i know how i spelt that)for christmas to keep her happy. it worked....for awhile. 
anywho, so now she's gone. and i'm here....typing....this thing....on my computer.....that is very messed up. i think i downloaded two viruses *bites finger* that can't be good.
yeah....my dad isn't home....he was supposed to be home but he's not. i'm not complaining however. i encourage him to get out of the house. gives me more time on the computer and even more chances to screw with it and seriously mess it up.

solitaire is so addictive.......i hate it.

my computer went whacko earlier. the colors on the desktop were all introverted....i had white hair (yes, i'm on the desktop)
it was kind of cool....for a milisecond and then i realized how busted i was if my dad found out. so i restarted it and everything and its back to normal...ish. 
our computer is so fucked up and full of viruses, its not funny. i'm constantly worrying about downloading something by accident, cuz if i do anything to this computer my dad will seriously kill me.

besides all of that, my life is going okay. 
my bestest friend from forever ago is in town, so i'm going to hang out with her tomorrow. her brother isn't as cute as he used to be....he cut his hair. i was like ""wtf? why'd u do that!?"" now he has super short hair.....which sucks. atleast i'm not so attracted to him that i lose my mind around him. 

last night i went sliding. boo yeah! it was fun. well.....at first i didn't like it. but then we went up to another trail (we were sledding on a mountain/ski resort) and i had so much fun on that. the trail looks flat, but u go super fast. i was yelling the entire time...and i ended up crashing because of grass and rocks on the trail. i flipped out of my sled and my hat and goggles came off and i was laughing so hard. the boys who had gotten down before i did were all looking at me. 
then i swung on the chair lift seats since the lift was turned off. 
new years eve i might go sledding again.......i dont' know. everything seems to be happening on that day. my sis is planning on having a party at her bfs house and she invited me and she said that everyone is going to be there. yay!
and also i have to perform with the chorus (yes, i'm in a chorus. blech...at times.) on new years in some church for first night. 
i dont' know what i'm going to do. i might skip sledding, perform and then go to the party. who knows. 

today my sister and i drove around town and got lunch at some pizzaria. it was fun. pizza....tasty goodness. it was great though, cuz we got to talk about stuff. sister to sister stuff. yay ^_^
she had a liter of root beer soda in her car, that was slightly frozen. she sort of gave it to me...so i've been drinking it all day. yummy

"event","wow....last night.....wow.
i have no clue how to talk about it. how to word it...how to explain it....omg.
well....i went to the snowball...and i had some fun.
i talked to this kid about working at a ski resort and instructing skiing lessons. we also talked about how many squares you could make with my polka dot dress. i was suprised.......because i don't even like him..and he doesn't even like me. i think at the dance he took a picture of me while i was dancing. i'm kind of peeved about that...because i probably didn't even look good.

i had to leave early though because my sister had been invited to a party and i had to come along because she was my ride home.
so i went.....and i was so scared. they're all upper classmen who i don't know! i was so scared, honestly. but once i got there...i felt good. everyone was beautiful, and there was alcohol everywhere. my sister handed me some sort of peppermint drink. it tasted like mouthwash. then she and i split a bottle of smirffnoff (i think). it tasted like soda.
someone turned on a strobe light....and everything went insane. i looked at my sister and she was standing so close to me....
the music was really loud...and the tv was on and there were christmas cartoons playing. i wanted to watch them...i felt so juvenile.
i wish we could've stayed longer so that i could've gotten really drunk. i think i'm more myself when i'm buzzed like that. on the drive home i kept talking and saying things at random. i wasn't scared to say whatever was in my head. and the laughter....omg, the laughter. i kept laughing. when i got home i was still smiling. and i made an entry in my journal so i would remember it always.
i was telling my sister that i was going to become the popular freshman who had the rad parties that everyone wanted to go to. lol, but that'll never happen.
i wish zac could've seen me taking that shot of peppermint schnoz (shnauz?) and drinknig that other bottle of whatever. i'd tell him ""look at me! washing away my innocence! i've cracked and done something wrong! is the world ending for u now zac? the perfect aimee is finally doing something wrong, something bad! and i'm enjoying myself!""
when i got home, i wanted to go back to the party so badly. i couldn't sleep, imagining all the fun that i was missing out on. the party was only 10 minutes away...and my parents were asleep. i could just sneak out with my sister and have fun.
i felt so sick afterwards. obviously i didn't inherit the tolerance that my sister has. i brushed my teeth so that my breath wouldn't smell. i didn't have any beer though...which i'm proud about. beer is disgusting.
before we left the snowball i was so scared. now i cant imagine why. the snowball seems millions of years ago. like it never happened.......the party is just so vivid in my mind. i want to have another experience like that. it was so wonderful.

thats all.... its what i did saturday night.
at 5:30 i'm leaving to go out caroling with a friend. yay! score! i've never been out caroling before."

i've been looking through some journals on this site...and i think i have a major crush on this guy. too bad he's probably too good for me....but its fun to have crushes. 
i don't think anything is going to happen with me and brandon. i'm not really expecting anything to happen anyways. i just like to look at him, because he's gorgeous. maybe someday he'll see me, but for now i'm pretty content with our relationship. everything is working out, and they're aren't any broken hearts. 

i was watching cartoons this morning, and i suddenly i realized that i was biting down on my tongue pretty hard. curiouser and curiouser. 

i wish i could believe in something, and know that that something existed. i'm tired of believing in stuff that doesn't exist...because it always ends up dissapointing me. i dont want to be pessimistic....when being optimistic is so much more fun.

i was in new york this weekend. pretty cool. i went to manhattan....and i saw the rockettes, and times square, and a play on broadway (mama mia...hehe....spandex, bright lights, abba music..and platform shoes. yee gads.)
i went with my sister.......and we had fun. we ate a lot of sushi....and saw lots of new yorkers.....and bought cds and anime and pocky..and we each bought a hoodie. mine's brown and her's white and its a zip up. mine just sort of ....called to me. 
i hate big clothing stores. i wanted to try on the hoodie..and so i just put it on right there in the store...cuz i mean....IT WAS A HOODIE! but then this guy came over and said ""sorry, but u have to try those on in the dressing room."" so i'm like ""okay.....*blush embarassed omg blush*"" so i ask him where it is....and he points to this big sign thats right next to me. so.....*blush embarassed omg blush* and i follow the little arrow on the sign. and i come up to this girl and ask her if i can try this on...and she says that the dressing room is over there, and she points me in this other direction. TOTALLY NOT WHERE THE SIGN WAS POINTING! so i go into the dressing room and ask if i can try this on and they say ""u have to wait in line."" and theres this huge line behind me! omg!
so i go to the back and wait and finally i get to try it on and it fits and i get it the end. 

i almost got hit by this guy on a bicycle. i was crossing the road and he almost hit me. it was this old guy in a green poncho, lmao. he yelled at me but i just laughed cuz i thought it was funny. he probably thought i was being an ass or i was just crazy. *shrug* 

thats all that i really have to say....i suppose. 

oh, right now i'm listening to the mama mia music on my cmputer. lmao, abba music! i don't know why....but i am. and now i have it stuck in my head. 

""mama mia, here i go again."""

"event","i don't have much to say. and anything that i do have to say isn't all that important or interesting. infact, it really doesn't even need to be said. but.....i'm going to post it anyways cuz thats the way i am.
i feel like i have something very important to say. but really, nothing is coming out. my head is blank, and i'm waiting for something to pop out. anything unusual. or something like that.
i'm kind of confused as of this moment. random things are running through my head. everything from hello kitty postcards, to lines in an italian film i saw when i was 10 years old.
but those aren't worth posting. random things are never worth anyone's time. sure, they're amusing. but some people strive to be ""random"" and funny....which i dislike.
i also dislike it when ice skaters fall down. it looks like it would hurt. and also, the lights are all down, and there's this one spot light following u around. camera flashes are sparking everywhere....and ur down on the ice. the unbearable coldness going through ur skimpy, revealing, paper thin costume. i could never become an ice skater because i know that this would happen to me atleast once in my career. it wouldn't be worth it in the end. also, i suck at ice skating.

wow....its my first post here.....and there's nothing really that i have to say, but i figured that i should write anyways. whats the point in getting a journal and then leaving it blank?

thats all

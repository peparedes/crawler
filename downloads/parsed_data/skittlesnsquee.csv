If there is one group of people in life that irritate me.. it's wiccans. that's the stupidest religion anyone could be, ever. I'd  be christian before i became wiccan (but im pretty sure i'll  never be either). and my mom is wiccan and she sits around at night with candles lit and writes in her little magic book and copies shit from very very terrible, corporate, barnes n nobles, 13-yr-old-rebelling sort of books. i love my mom and all, but.. It just disappoints me that she got all wiccan all of a sudden. And my father is a republican. *sigh*

i need to get drunk, immeadiatley."

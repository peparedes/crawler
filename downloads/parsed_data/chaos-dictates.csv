In the long term scope of things, kindness is never regrettable. In certain situations it might also require sacrifice in order to see the kindness come to a positive outcome. This is not weakness, but great strength.

Anger (fear), violence, aggression, dishonesty, these things are clear weaknesses and lead to themselves in the end.

Kindness is certainly a virtue. I think it is a greater virtue when done for the benefit of others, rather than for some (often unconscious) hope for a reward in return. I don't think that self serving kindness is really much of a virtue.."

"event","...and I think they're on a suicide mission, here's why:

Friday was my day off... Woke my son up early and headed to the gym... with plans of cleaning the apartment, feeding him a snack and then heading out to the park for the rest of the afternoon.

I realized I had a 40lb bucket of cat litter in my trunk I *needed* to get to my apt so I gave my keys to my son to hold until we (slowly....) made our way to the apt... He was thrilled I have entrusted him with this task.  

finally in the elevator... Aidan, my adorable loving son, was excited to unlock the apt door (I don't know... these kind of things excite an (almost) 8 year old.)

The elevator dings... and I pick up the 1000lb bucket of cat litter I have been slowly lugging down the street, and we start to walk out of the elevator...

When my son DROPS the keys...

It seemed like forever they were lingering there taunting us, on the 1 & 1/2 inch opening to vast blackness that is the elevator shaft. It was probably no more than 2 seconds before they decided to take a chance and escaped their life...

""you will no longer make us live in such cramped spaces... car keys, office keys, keys to mom & dad's home , mom & dad's summer home, upper and lower lock, front door lock, the garage key, the garage door opener, cvs card, walbaums card, key food cat, Met card, Petco card, cards for stores you don't even frequent but have on there JUST IN CASE, your new gym membership card that makes all the other cards feel insecure... we just can't take it so peace out homey.. we want our freedom.""

So they lingered and within those few seconds just slithered their way down the shaft.... to which I muttered obscenities that would make me owe my son $$ (we have a potty word system) and my son started to cry b/c it was he who dropped them...

Down the elevator shaft, 4 floors they went... their destination, unknown...

and hour and a 1/2 later, me in my sweaty gyms clothes, my son withOUT his psp, having an (almost) 8 year old crisis b/c he feels somewhat guilty but it isnt the worst thing in the world to happe, sitting on a 1782783 lb bucket of cat litter... The elevator dings...

Ray The Porter to the rescue.

life is good again... I have been reunited with those little metal children I have come to love and rely on... (as well as the plastic ones who save me $.50 off a package of paper towels, tissues, fantasic WHATEVER... they were mine again.

until this afternoon... 

A rainy afternoon on a busy queens boulevard is not a reason to rush hastily.

Upon picking my son up from his babysitter, driving to his pediatrician's office on Main Street, JUST to drop off those oh so needed camp medical forms, I realized I needed to run to the bank and make a quick deposit.

A spot right out front, SCORE!

Money still in the meter... SCORE!

Aidan, sit right here, mommy is running inside to make a deposit...

My umbrella s ucks b/c half of it is broken and n actuality I'm only holding 1/2 the umbrella...

In the bank, i throw my bag, my keys and my bank card onto the glass counter and grab one of those pens who's wire never quite unravels enough for you to write normally with, start filling out my deposit slip when I hear this strange sound.

The sounds of 127817821 little keys and club card memberships leaping to their death.

My keys? What was that? 

I move my bag and realize my fate.

The letters spell it out for me as my heart drops...

W-A-S-T-E

and the 1/2 inch hole that divides me and my livelihood.

my keys have descended into the 'waste receptacle' hole the bank has provided underneath the table...

I can see them... staring up at me... laughing at me... taunting me.. and I tried to stick my hand in there but only my fat little fingers could reach...

They love me no more...

should I let them go? 

I cannot.

I have an ace in the hole with little arms, and he is sitting in the car in my view.

I run out, battling the rain without the umbrella who doesn't work to begin with and tap on the window for my little hero to open the car locks.

I tell him...""Hero, I need you... and your little arms""

He rushes to the mission without question and I am so determined I don't even bother to lock the doors to my car... (If you lived in my neighborhood you would think I was crazy...)

but I am... my keys have made me so.

We try... his arms not quite small enough to reach... I try a pen... some tape i had in my purse (don't ask)...

Thoughts of going to the Rite Aid next door to buy a hanger were entering my mind when my (almost) 8 year old suggests we look under the table to see if we can open the receptacle.

I was willing to pry open whatever receptacle may be, but alas... the only security keeping me from the waste is one little button.

I hold my breath and slide it...

paper rolls out and within moments... my little metal children....

cheers are heard from the mountain side 
(ok-- from my son & I and the voices in my head)

but my heart is relaxed and I once again grab ahold to my little prisoners..."

"event","I have been trying to find the energy and motivation to actually POST a journal entry worth reading.  Not that anything in my life is WORTH reading, but so many insignificant things happen in my life on a daily basis that I would <i>like</i> to share, or at least need to get out of my system.

Its funny because when I first started writing in LiveJournal, I couldn't <b>wait</b> to wind down at the end of the day and share my day's activities with cyberspace.

Now, it seems I would rather sit on the couch with my powerbook in lap, alternating staring at the computer screen and watching TV than waste the energy typing an entry.  
(ew!)

Its not that though... I just lack the motivation and to be honest, I'm having a really HARD TIME articulating my thoughts lately.. Lately meaning within the last 3 years or so..

Writing used to come so easy to me.. Thoughts pouring out of me like [insert creative & witty analogy here]  Now I feel uneducated, incoherent, and just plain STUPID.  Would you believe my mother is an English Professor who teaches GRAMMER??  I still can't believe how I constantly Butcher the English language considering from whose loins I was discharged from.  

I'm forever feeling stunted and this is an issue I have had with myself since as long as I can remember.  Or at least, as long as I was old enough to learn a person must <i>care</i> about themselves.. care what others think... PRESENT themselves in a certain light.  GOD how exhausting!  Seriously, at what age do we indirectly learn to NOT be ourselves?  I look at Aidan and his peers:  how simple and innocent their lives are.  Their purpose, in life right now, is to have as much fun as possible.  By all means eat as much candy, chicken nuggets and fruit loops as you can possibly get away with.  

I'm watching him closely I tell you because I am going to try my HARDEST to make sure he stays innocent and free for as long as possible.

Not being able to express myself in a comprehensible way is bothering me BIG TIME.  For a while, i just resisted writing in here because I found myself treating it like a thesis or more simply: an essay.  Nobody wants to read:  'I rode my bike today...'  My entries must be these elaborate, creative entities complete with links, photos and clever little transitions.  I found this to be TERRIBLY frustrating because for, what if I took the time to spell check, grammar check, and 'attention grabbing' check...and 

nobody commented.
nobody read.
FOR SHAME!!!

I don't even know anything past basic HTML.

HAHA-- Honestly though.. I KNOW a few of you (if you're reading) can relate to me when I say there is a tad of resentment when you suspect your friends are just <i>skimming</i> over your entries.  it's as if you have a great thought, or idea and want to start your post off with the <font size=6> 
BIG FONT.. 
</font>with <font color=red><font size=6> COLOR</font><font color=black> 
pronouncing:
<font color=red>
<marquee><font size=6>READ ME READ ME READ ME READ ME READ ME READ ME READ ME READ ME READ ME</font></marquee>

<font color=black>
If your entry is too long, you risk the fate of 'being skimmed' and God-forbid you put ANYTHING behind an ""lj-cut.""  At least, anything before the scrolling marquee that is going to get someones attention.  You know you are going to edit the post about 273623628 times, and NEED to alert everyone by announcing you made an <b>[EDIT]!!</b>.
(I have edited this about 6 times since I posted it, btw.)

[exhausted sigh]  Its just that my brain goes in circles and I remember a time where my <i>award winning</i> entries (tongue in cheek) coexisted with proclamations of how horny I was at the moment.  AND I WAS PERFECTLY CONTENT.
Lately it seems I'm just using this journal to promote my non existent artistic career, though, that is actually blooming more than usual, lately.
(proper english?)
Do you know I used to write down the words I spelled wrong after running something through 'spell check?'  As if I'm going to keep thid 3X5 index card of 'misspelled words' in my wallet and never make that mistake again.  I also kept a shortcut of dictionary.com on my desktop.
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.

My spelling is about as good as a freshman in college.  an <i>average</i> freshman.
(I will spell check this entry-- though)

Another thing I have noticed is that I am having a REALLY hard time <b>speaking</b> to people.  Not  chit chatting or simply conversing with my friends.. but like: when I meet another parent, or someone at work.  This is something I am noticing more & more of and it is slowly becoming an internal issue with me that I really need to address soon because it makes me uber- uncomfortable.  What makes me even MORE uncomfortable is the fact that i just casually made use of the term *uber*.  

Perhaps, one day, I'll carry on intensive and thorough research about this, but probably not.  For now, it feels good to just simply <i>write</i> my thoughts.  I've said it before, I think in run-on sentences.  MOST of the time, at least.  For now, I'll just content myself with the fact that I'm releasing some kind of emotion desperately in need of release, forget that I'm reintroducing myself to this forum with a reason why I haven't involved myself in that forum with the promises of staying in that forum... 'Hey, I'll be writing a <i>REAL</i> update soon'

It's not writers block, I'm not a writer.  I'm just a person who for some reason, will never be able to completely turn myself off to this place.  (It always amazed me that people were able to do that.)
Not me.. no way.

Still here.  Still analyzing and obsessing.  For how many years, I can't tell you because the past is getting a little fuzzy and THAT really scares me.

so.. anyone still reading?

[edit] shamroq has brought to my attention that I mispelled grammar when writing about my bad spelling and grammar but I am not going to change it based on principle""

but i shall resist... I shall resist.

(I am only human, man...)

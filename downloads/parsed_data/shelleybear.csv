A few quick updates
Number one:
Remember years ago, when I said I was transitioning from male to female.
Even before it was trendy.
Here I am, years later.
Post-op and overjoyed.
Number two:
There is only so much crap you can take from the socio political antics of some country before it just becomes too damned much.
For me it reached the boiling point in Flint, Michigan.
Congratulations government you are now poisoning your own children in the name of saving a buck.
I'm done with you.
The 2016 presidential election.
One megalomaniac bully.
One woman who seems to feel she is owed the presidency.
One psychopathic Texan and one lone voice that seems to be saying ""STOP!""
While the Republican party has obstructed necessary change and wonders HOW they got Donald Trump.
Spare me.

More to come."

First, let me say thank you to Scott and Irene Raun for your visit up to St. Cloud.
Lovely having you.
Then let me say, it is unlikely I will travel in for many MNSTF meetings or functions.
The truth is, I have learned, over the years, to be more and more self-contained, and, as I don't want to blow off the cost of gas and time to travel to the cities for any but the most major events, I will no longer ask the same of others.
So, see ya around, but not that often."

The baggage attached to it was not created by me.
In fact, my life would be perfect if I did not have to deal with it.
It is this situation that threatens to radicalize me and create the image of the mythical ""Trans Monster""  that society insists we are.
Society needs to stop judging us by a different set of rules then what it judges itself by.
We are men and women.
Stop using the damned modifier on us.
Stop being afraid of us.
Stop creating boogeymen where there aren't any."

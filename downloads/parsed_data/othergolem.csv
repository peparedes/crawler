I don't study you hard, and I don't spend the time on you that you deserve. And it would be okay, you know. If you didn't forgive me. If you didn't want me back any more, i would understand.  I've called you names, and avoided you. I've blamed you, and yelled at you, and walked away from you more times than I can count. But none of it is your fault, Math, it's not.

It's my fault. It's my fault, Math, because when something is wrong, it's because I've made a mistake. It's not even the mistake that's the problem. it's not, because you never stop me from coming back, from trying to work out what I've done wrong.  You're very forgiving, if we want to be fair. And.. I haven't been fair, Math, I haven't been. I avoid you, I play games instead of thinking about you, I look at comics and read stories, i try desperately to put you out of my head, Math, because

because of what making mistakes does to me.  Every time I get a number wrong, or forget a sign, or don't factor, or can't work out a number, i feel like I've failed. it's not a 'mistake', it's not a mental slip of numbers--it's the years of practice I didn't get, didn't have the chance to get, that other people were pushed through. It's the four high schools I was made to attend, jumping from school to school over three years, because we couldn't afford to live in the same place. It was the scratch of transcripts, and the homeschooling I did in middle childhood--""I can do all things through christ who strengthens me"" has no place on a math test. It has none, and today, the words I hear from bibles feel like clay in my mouth, ash, in my ears, because of that indoctrination I was pushed at.

because i was told that i was a mistake. told, and shown, repeatedly, that i was a dropped sign, that i didn't really belong, that no one could really love me for what i was, who i was. Being called someone's favorite mistake means you still shouldn't have happened.  And that's what I feel like, Math, when we touch and I feel the smooth caress of your whisper, saying ""it's okay, try again. You'll get it."" It's why I get up, run away, back off from you so much, that burning frustration with myself.

...has anyone ever told you, Math, the way they told me, that you don't belong in their lives? You... get it a lot, I guess. People don't see you as useful, or as important.

..I wish I was good at you, Math. You have so much beauty, locked away inside, like a good book. Like a mystery novel. You have so much discovery in you, and I see people more familiar with you, more intimate with you, and my jealousy and feeling of YOU CAN'T, burns, it burns, in me, and aches in my soul, and whispers poisons that i can never overcome what happened to me.


but part of me, i think, secretly loves you, math.

i wish i was better to you. i want to be better to you.

can we try again?"

"event","So, as you all can see, my plan to update every day flopped. I felt, for one thing, like I just didn't have anything worthwhile to say. But that doesn't stop some people from posting their opinions, and it's self-derogatory anyway, so why not simply post anyway?  Today, I was out enjoying some bright sunshine, which led me to think about the incredibly complex chemical and biological processes that make up our world and enable life to exist--from photosynthesis all the way up through the food chain to our high-degree heavy-duty link--and I was just struck agog. This wasn't the sort of thing I used to think about, or used to have the knowledge to appreciate.  School changed me.

And I'm lucky for it. I'm lucky for the chance to continually and radically expand my world beyond what I know, even though so much of my life is spent on trivial pursuits like gaming or music or honest relaxation or role-playing as something I'm not. Over lunch, someone expressed regret to me that they felt that asking people for help made them feel worth less, or like they weren't worthy, or that they had failed in some way.  I responded for the first time in a while with a thought experiment:  Assume the adage about it taking ten thousand hours to master a practice--any practice, let's generalize a little bit--is true.  If you worked for forty hours a week to master your craft,  that would mean that you'd spend two hundred and fifty weeks on it, or pretty close to FIVE YEARS.

Five years!

Assuming you spent the first ten years of your life, you know, actually developing, that puts you (if you've got a nice healthy life expectancy) at about 70 years to spend. In that time, you could master all of... 14 trades.   Fourteen. I can rattle off fourteen specialties just in my ideal field, computer science.  There are worlds of doctors, each with specializations, writers, poets, musicians; there are scientists in dozens on dozens of categories, there are sports and other physical practices, farming, retail work and customer service, teachers, administrators, sociologists--the list goes on and on and on for thousands of potential choices and if we devote our whole flickering candle of a life to learning, to JUST LEARNING, we get fourteen, a scant, precious fourteen, of those.


Interconnectedness is vital to our survival. It's essential to our beings, even those like me who shy away from a lot of social interaction.  Without people--lots of people, dozens of hundreds of people to discover from and rely on and learn from--we are capable of mastering only the very scantest part of the great and expansive and vast and winding and complex world that surrounds us.  We are very small, in a vast world with lessons everywhere... and I love it that way.


Tune in next time, same bat-time, same bat-channel."

Hey, everyone.

I am a bisexual. The reason I call myself a bisexual is: I have met and been attracted to men, and I have met and been attracted to women. Sexuality is not a choice; it is simply an aspect of who I am. The reason I do not call myself pansexual or other labels is that I haven't known anyone outside the standardized male-female spectrum personally enough to know if I'm attracted to them. (This is actually misleading, but that is an entirely different discussion.) Bisexuality exists. Bisexuality is not a moral failure, nor should it be a condemned horrific thing. It simply exists.

On a related note, I do not frequent any organized religion. If you tell me that I am going to go to hell, I am likely as not to simply disbelieve you. If you pack that speech with hatred and slurs, I will be frightened of you, not what you claim to represent.  While this has not been an issue for a very, very long time--or at least, has not threatened my personal security--the fact remains that the broader culture in which I exist makes allowances to people to hate me and discriminate against me. It led to abuses in my childhood, phobic behavior and toxic claims that I am only now beginning to clean out of my mind, and most horrifyingly, an instance in which someone who claimed to be a preacher put me in a headlock in the house where I lived and pushed against my forehead and insisted that, if I made gagging or retching noises, I was possessed.


Or, as I have said repeatedly since that time, I was suffocating.

Religions often offer unique moralities. They often offer comforts and consolations. But they also offer the toxic belief that ""believers"" know what is best. It's a crutch and an excuse for people who in no way espouse any of the actual teachings of the religion to resort to violence and oppression on many levels, simply because it is there, and is a haphazard shield to make that behavior somehow socially acceptable.  If the gods want to talk to me, then that's fine. If they exist, I am reasonably sure they do not need an intermediary.  Ultimately, I am not convinced this is any religion's fault, unless of course it dogmatically oppresses others as quite a few do: people would be equally willing to use political affiliation, shared fandom, insular communities, the anonymity of the internet, or one of any other number of countless defenses.

I simply want to give people as little of that leeway as I can. Is that wrong?

I am going to post an LJ every day this week. I do not care particularly if I get any followers, re-blogs, am re-twittered, receive comments, post anything insipid OR insightful, if I come across as someone who is whining on the internet, touch on popular fandom, offend people, do not offend people, shock and appall people, or am as vanilla mayo white bread as they come. I am writing an LJ post every day this week as a practice in basic writing diligence.  Someone said the unexamined life is not worth living, so let's try examining it just a little bit: I'm doing this for myself.

But what should I write? Free verse for seven days wouldn't exactly sing to me, so instead, why don't I talk about just how amazing SCIENCE IS?  Yes, that's the ticket!  Science and humanity.  It's very easy to lose faith in ourselves, as a human race. It's easy to believe that the daily atrocities and just plain cruel behaviors we inflict on each other, unintentionally and intentionally, are the overall theme of human beings. I am inclined, however, to disagree on this point!

For one thing, humans have the remarkable ability to band together to do really neat things.  Bill Nye recently conducted an interview with a scientist on the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION(!) about a contest winner's experiment: to see if jumping spiders could hunt fruit flies in a zero gravity environment. (They learned how.) You read that right: We have created space-faring jumping-spiders capable of hunting in ZERO GRAVITY.

For another thing, we also have the profound tendency to band together to do silly, amusing things, like make <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG20nWOb7Ks&amp;feature=player_embedded"">an entire high-rise building a canvas for pixel art </a>. We live in a fantastic churning world full of experimental music, song, and humor, and we live individual lives as part of a teeming mass of humanity that is interconnected in a huge way.

It's easy to forget that.  I should get to my homework, which involves researching cell structure and some other things, but thanks for reading!

My Mind is a Hammer.

Behold this, my Hammer.
My Hammer is slow to swing.
It is easy, my Hammer, to dodge.
It is sometimes weighty, my Hammer,
with the dregs of all my experiences
of life.

It is this weight which makes it slow.
It is often heavy, my hammer, needing
the full force of my will to swing.

It is not a rapier, like some minds
full of swift and sharp flourishes,
stinging like death from a thousand
hornet's nests.

Nor is it sharp, my Hammer, and edged,
and calculating, turning and twisting,
thrusting or parrying; it is not as noble
or as beautiful as a sword-mind is.

It is not a gun, my Hammer, firing quickly
jittery, loaded with seven bullets, eight,
quick as death, firing every which way at once,
direct and swift and penetrating.

It is not a lance, my Hammer, carried by nobler
people on nobler steeds; people who have the
world to carry them, the thundering hooves of
a great multitude to drive home the points they
choose to make.

It is not an axe, my Hammer, Divisive, gleaming
with grooves and rivulets, brandished high in the
sun of This and That, of Left and Right and Wrong.
I am not sharp enough, often, to see those divides.

No, my mind is a Hammer. It is heavy with the weight
of a lifetime abused, insulted and degraded, with
the loss of love, with the opening, painful and gradual,
of my eyes to my ignorance and privilege;

It is scored with a half-dozen mars, my Hammer, for I use it,
and when I use it, it bashes against concepts unknown and
unfamiliar to me.  It is not sturdy, my Hammer, nor is it the
mightiest of things. Slow, patient, ponderous, a swing in a wide arc,

to build things up

to tear things down.  Because a hammer is not a weapon
only, to inflict a wound and win. A hammer can build, can bind,
can push together. A hammer can smash, can open wide. A Hammer,
my Hammer, is slow, sometimes, in its momentum; awkward too in
its use. It is not flittering and fancy, slight and hidden. No,
My Mind is a Hammer, and it is mine.

I would not trade it, slow as it is, heavy as it is, for anything.
Because I can lift it, My Hammer.  I can lift it a thousand times,
because a hammer is humble, simple, plain. It is not forged, a Hammer,
it is not slender or to be broken and cast aside. It is Diligent, a Hammer,
My Hammer, working and toiling and building and breaking and opening
and closing doors, collapsing walls and building them. My Hammer can endure
a thousand swings, a thousand thousand swings.

And so can I.

I would not give it up for the world.

"event","So today started beautifully at about four thirty, two and a half hours before I was supposed to get up, when I woke up hacking and coughing and with a feeling of stomach acid in my throat. Has anyone out there ever had this, or any tips on how to make it go away? In any event, classes are easing into full swing, and wow are they tougher than I've been expecting.

I guess this is the difference between a community college and a fullblown four year university and stuff. Oog. Stress sickness is bad!"

"event","So, yesterday (August 29th, 2012) was my first day of classes here at my university. It's a cut way above the sorts of institutional study I'm used to. I'm not even going to lie. Even their 100 level courses challenge the heck out of you.  But because first day stress isn't intimidating enough, quite a few things happened.  Take, for instance, the unplanned two hour nap I took directly after getting home--evidently a six AM wakeup call is going to take some adjustment. My first class was Macroeconomics, an elective I took because honestly all the classes I actually need were full. Joy.  It was actually a fairly pleasant class, I'm not going to lie--the teacher did her best to make the class fresh and interesting.  I had a full hour after it to process the information, sort out my folders, put my notes away, that sort of thing, before I had my next one; so I took a pocket monster break, tidied up my folders, made a note of things, so on.

Then on to Environmental Science. That was actually really engaging, just as I'd hoped--I'm going to have to better keep up with the news if I want to do well in that course, though. It's promoting engaging in communal discussion a lot, which fits the themes of the course that a small group of individuals can still affect change. Right after that was sociology. Protip: Seeing much of Super Size Me, a documentary about Mcdonald's and United States Resident obesety, kind of put me off my breakfast--a pinch-and-go desperate Mcd's breakfast. Urgh. Also, the seats are HORRIBLY TINY. Or maybe I've just got a big fat butt. Column a, column b. You know how it is--I'm actually a pretty big person away from the keys, so there you go.

Then I was treated to a nice lunch, went home, and took an unscheduled two hour nap, putting the time at about three thirty.

And then the power went out. Yeah, that was less than pleasant--I already had typed-paper style homework, which I'm writing this to help me procrastinate on. I also have a book to return, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  Two hours later, power comes back--and I check my e-mail.  I got into one of my waitlisted classes, which turned the I-should-be-out-already part of today (the thirtieth) into WAIT FOR SIX HOURS for your next class, which you actually need.

WHEE.

Stacking things, our houseowner is being taken off of his project (he's got a good gig) come June. So, well, yeah. All that on day one. They sure didn't wait to kick me in the butt, huh? Still, all this will be good for me, even if the math doesn't permit calculators at all (AWK, I am math-weak and tech dependent) and biology is scary like a scary thing... Enriching myself is the most valuable thing I can do.

FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS! Oh, wait. Wait, this is a fine opportunity to promote somebody. <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zUjSHL_Fks>Ladies and gentlemen, intergendered persons, as well as any who don't fall into any of the above categories: First World Problems, the Musical!</a> Enjoy."

"event","This morning, I had a dream.

I was in the hospital for some reason. Possibly some sort of accident--
I was on an IV and everything. When I woke up, the doctor explained that
I was fine, but I recall seeing him very upset. WhenI asked what was wrong,
he explained that he had seen my hipbone was compatable with a child--don't
ask, you know that dream logic often doesn't--who couldn't walk.  Essentially,
if I gave up my leg, he would be able to walk, when he'd never done so before.
In the dream, I raised all sorts of worried questions--I was uninsured, the
first one was, and my second question if I remember right was ""he's never
been able to play?"". That may have been a thought, not a question, and I knew
from the very beginning I was going to do it.  Then I woke up a bit, and fell
asleep a little more, and had more dreamlets--of me learning to cope with a
cane, and of mentoring him--Misao was his name--of ways in which I had messed
up my life, and for him to avoid. I had a very older-brother vibe going on,
and despite actually being an older brother, it was the first time I've ever
felt like that. I think I  may have adopted him-esque in the dream--We visited
UMBC together, which is where I'm sorting out my classes today.

It was a dream of beginnings and fresh feelings, and it was a just plain
incredible way to wake up."

"event","Okay, I think I'll share this one. Normally, I don't remember my dreams, but this one I want to post as fast as I possibly can, because I believe this is the second time I've had it, or at least close to it.  I dreamed of a restaurant--bear with me-about the size of a small sit-down restaurant in a mall. This place was run by humans, but it catered to monster cuisine--sort of like how 'chinese' restaurants in the US don't so much serve Chinese cuisine as an approximation thereof. Given that I think one of the proprietors was a vegetarian, this was a little unusual. There was a pirate-dressed woman floor actor, who, every day at I believe 3:00 and 4:20, would come in and order a meal--an 'adventurer', can you believe it?--and I believe my exact reaction to her was to turn around and head back to my table--only to find three empty bottles of what I suspect were supposed to be whiskey, but were most assuredly, well

""WHERE DID ALL THIS BOOZE COME FROM?""

""WAIT, IT'S ALL GONE?!"""

"event","I live in the United States. Right now, I will not deny that I live in one of the wealthier parts of the country. I'm not often proud of my country.

I am today.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14245144


Our first African-American president just removed the prejudiced, foolish, baseless discrimination keeping gay people, lesbian people, and bisexual people, amongst others, from serving in their own country's military. This was a legal thing, before. Silence, legally enforced. And I, despite never planning to become a member of the military, hated it.

Because it represents.

This was a rule which represented the belief that gay people, lesbian people, and Bisexual people WEREN'T--People, I mean. That they should be silent. That they should keep to themselves. That, in this backward society, they should be ashamed and treated as a nonentity.

I am proud, today. Because today?

Today that representation got the death it deserved.

My name is Ryan. I'm a Bisexual American. And I am proud, of my country, today.


I am proud because I feel represented. Truly. Fairly. Equitably. I feel Proud. I feel Justified. I feel like I exist, a little bit more--or am a little less non-existent.  We should all be proud, today. Because we are a little closer to this incredible, potent, and world-touching statement:


""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.""

This statement was penned in an era where one person might be considered property of another. We, collectively, have come so far, since then--and we must keep going.  One group, one type of Person at a time--we must keep going.




Even if the steps are small.


I am proud of my country, today."

You act like I have not done this.

For all the good it did me, yeah. Even if I still have problems, I'd do it. And I'd do it again, if it came down to it.  We had to move four times in a year, while I was growing up--one person, just me, is way less chaos than that."

"event","I go to bed at four AM, after my homework (quite a lot of that) is done.
I try, restlessly, hopelessly, to fall into the arms of the most beautiful
creature I know--sweet Dreaming, one who takes us and sometimes frightens
and enthrals us with their mystery.

It is of no use.

I close my eyes, breathe deeply. My eyes, dry for want of rest, twitch
in my skull; as birdsong begins outside and the light of a morning I
should not be seeing pours in through my window.

The dryer. I have forgotten the dryer.

I go to turn it on, a second time. I return to bed.

The banging from the metal belt loop, I assume, in the dryer, is deafening.

I cannot sleep.

I cannot rest.

Am I unsuitable, Nox?  Do you not wish me to sample your embrace?
Wish you no rest upon my weary soul, no respite for my aching body?

Insomnia, it seems, is a thing that grapples with me intently."

"event","So recently--last week, in fact--I had a final presentation in a class.

Due to certain unfortunate circumstances, I had three weeks of material to
prepare in one night.  But I did it and got a passing grade.  But, after
such a devastating time, and honestly, a week that was nothing short of
terribly unpleasant for the most part, I found myself standing outside,
under gathering thunderstorm clouds--the air was slightly muggy, with
the ambient humidity of a rain that wasn't quite ready to break.

I asked: ""Why do I do this to myself?""

So I came up with a little experiment. Just a tiny one. I might need some
help with it later, depending on ho well it foes or doesn't go, but
I'm not off to a stellar start.

More posts to come, all of them boring."

"event","Okay, this is a breakdown of my past week.

Monday:  Turn in programming homework I was up till one thirty or so finishing.  Have a total freakout when it doesn't show code at first; begin to breath again once I find a way to access it.  Cram for tuesday.

Tuesday:  French exam.  Examen du Francois. Need to find the right Unicode for that C.  Was positively freaked and panicked, struggled through it.

Wednesday:  Programming class.  With no homework due immediately, take a night to myself to decompress/rest (Desperately needed).

Thursday (Yesterday): Receive exam, after A) accidentally sitting in someone else's chair and B) forgetting my faux amis--Library/bookstore.  Scored an 89. Ugh.  Felt like crap, knew I could do better.  Damn perfectionist streak chewing on my ass.

Today (Projected):  Go to Geology class, clueless.  Have barely reviewed material, feel like I'm getting way over my head.  Come home, work on either A) lab, due sunday which usually takes 3-4 hours, B) programming homework, C) HTML homework due in three days, D) French homework (lowest priority, due tuesday.)

Saturday (Projected): Homework.  More homework.  Struggle to focus.

Sunday: Desperate push to finish lab; programming, HTML.


I feel like I'm totally in over my head... i'm wondering if i can really handle this, lately."

"event","so since Saturday--not this saturday, two days ago, but the whole week before that--I 
have been caring for Dyzz, whose health has rapidly degenerating due to bronchitis,
culminating in a seven and a half hour trip to the ER yesterday that started at 5:00.
I have a sinus infection and her brother is sick too, and while I tell them not to 
worry about it, the truth is that I've got almost no reserves at all right now.  I've
been having a hard time trying to sleep, and a rougher time trying to ingore my suffering,
and only now with the medicines I picked up have I been able to breathe properly.  I sincerely
hope this is the point where the sicknesses break down, so I can take care of things around
here--gods know that other people aren't in any shape to.

I miss sis.

I miss being well.

I miss having laptop space and not having to be the one to do the dishes and take care of everything.

un-enjoyed life, at their midriffs, at their habits, at their hobbies.  And they are asking themselves: ""Why am

Right now, people are getting off the sofas, up from bed, home from work, just to lunch.  People are looking at
their environment, and for the first time in their life, asking: ""Why is it like this?""  It begins slowly--a casual

"event","The dream began with the chase.

A man on horseback--was it horseback?--chasing an animal-not-animal through the street, with no one but me there to witness it.
It was a large creature, very much shaped like a bull and clearly not a bull, because it had a horn--a long, single, pointed horn, in the midst of its forehead. And two more, now that I think about it.  Its coat was as black as night--not the frendly starlit twilight I walk, deep, dark, primal night, the kind of night that swallows men and never gives them back.

But it was not the horn that told me it was not a bull--it was the eyes.  The eyes, that crackled with some sort of spark, a kind of intensity that moved me in deep and profound ways--and then the chase was on again, and it was gone.  I decided it was a unicorn.

Soon it came by me, limping, its horn severed almost to the base.  I recall it looking different, then, more horselike; and as I touched it, trying to comfort its loss, it was a kitten with a thumbtack--and then, an odd blue almost-cube.

It was a strange device.   It displayed text, and offered me the chance to win something--but I was only interested in knowing what had become of the unicorn.  So I engaged it--I recall not having much choice, and having severe trepidation at this point.
And it offered me a simple task:  After a board meeting, a woman was going to go sit in a chair overlooking a window, where they would have an epiphany that would better the world.  One of the members of the meeting was going to interfere by breaking, I had assumed, the window to the meeting room. The task given to me was simple:  ""Don't let the glass break.""

Through a mixture of politeness, in-your-face curiosity, and frustrating conversation, I kept the other student from firing multiple darts into the window.  And time went by, as it did in dreams--the cube kept provoking me, sending me on assignments, and face ater face of the not-quite-cube began to get more malevolent--before I was at the meeting room again, and the other student was there, howling, with a chair over his head, howling like a desperate demon, as he swung at the WINDOW--and the person was curled up, far away, terrified...

more happened, but it's slipping away from me. More later."

"event","I have, over the course of tonight, determined I cannot sleep.  And when I say ""Cannot"", what I mean is that the moment I shut my eyes <i>characters</i> begin to flow through my head, sights and sounds and ideas that will not be hushed.  These vanish, like the night before the howling birds and the pouring sunlight o'er the morning, and I curse myself.

I cannot sleep.  Beside me, the one I am sworn to breathes slowly. Deeply. Regularly.  It is a state I try to match, a rhythm I do my best to mimic, but it does me no good.  My body pulses with hours and hours worth of restless energy, yet when I get up to work, I find my tasks have evaporated like sweat off the skin of my brow, and exhaustion overtakes me.

I cannot sleep.  Squire's concerns, petty things, pound incessantly at the insides of my mind.  Will I have enough money? Will I succeed in life?  Will I have what I seek from my mate, from myself?  Why do I not put forth the needed effort to transform the elements of my life that do this to me?

Observation, as they say, is key.

I have been living much adrift, these days.  What will happen is this:

I shall go to class. I shall struggle to stay awake, and burn at the tallow of my wick to accomplish the tasks set before me, despite my exhaustion.  I shall imbibe substances which make it further difficult to sleep, in all likelihood. And, when my hollow body has poured out its reserves, I will meander my way home and collapse, possibly for several hours, making it even more difficult to sleep tonight.

I need help.

I need a place for my ideas and energies to go.

I need an <i>outlet</i>."

I know you don't want to fucking BE there on a saturday--nice job making us feel like the class is important--and I love how the very first day you told us you didn't fail anyone and then acted shocked when several students said HAH HAH HAH fucking easy I'll MISS EVERY CLASS LA LA LA.

I don't care if you don't think our time isn't worth much. And I know I've been sick and missed several classes.  But you know what?  I'm still getting ALL my fucking assignments done.

My time may not be worth a god damned thing to you but if I am sick and recovering and you do not treat us--not ONCE--with the god damned common DECENCY to be on time to your OWN CLASS I will treat you with exactly the respect you deserve: None.

Because I don't care if you like to be late or not.  I don't give a flying fuck you if you don't want us to be there or not. I don't even care you don't want to BE there.

I'm a student. I'm there to fucking excel.  And you, YOU, have made me STOP. CARING.  There are no fucking WORDS for how much contempt I have for a teacher who has <i>made</i> a student literally not care.</lj-cut>

"event","So for as long as I've been able to remember, I've wanted to be a goodfe--wait, no, that's nor right at all.
So for at least the past seven years,  I've known about the existence of two people: My sister (an online person
who I have grown so fond of that when I am describing her, I type the words 'my sister' and it is apparently several
minutes before I realise I might need to clarify that to someone who thinks family is blood or genes, and her beau,
someone I used to talk to, on and off, several years ago--but who I try to respect for who he is, which admittedly 
I don't know a lot about. We haven't kept contact, lately, but he has lots of work, and he doesn't have the presence my sister does.
Lately, though, they've been arguing occasionally--not talking to each other for days at a time, and while it's not my business 
or my place to judge either of them for it, I can't help but worry about them both.

They've been together longer than Dyzzy and I have, if memory serves me right, and I've always seen them as the most stable
couple in the world--the notion of them arguing like this doesn't really sink in, or stick in my mind.  But looking at things
now, I've begun to really think about who they are and what they mean to me.  They mean the world to me, and I don't want to see
either of them end up hurt--not by each other, and I'm beginning to worry that something I've done is making things worse.
I don't know what to do about it, but I won't simply leave it silent--so, as you two know who you are, if you read this...

I know you love each other very much. At least, I hope that's still true--I haven't heard from one of you in several years,
so what I really know is pretty one-sided.  But I was there when you two got together, years ago, for the most part.  And
I was both impressed, and inspired, and I promised myself that if the time ever came, I'd be as honest about my feelings as
you were to each other.

So here I am. Here I'll be.

Talk to each other.  Please. I know it's maybe not what you want to hear, and I know it's not my place to say anything, but talk to each other and really listen to what you have to say--both of you. I don't like worrying about the two people who shaped my life more than almost anyone else, back then, and who I am now.


I hope it works out well for both of you."

"event","So, my Lady-friend and I went out to dinner at Olive Garden, last night, and the topic drifted, as it occasionally does, into the realm of Video Games. As we both play Pokemon, I happened to mention that I found it ironic that the game I owned that was designed in the most cartoonish and childish way--Pokemon--is actually the game that deserves the Mature themes most.  Before you ask me what the devil I'm on about, I'm referring to <i>actual</i> mature themes--not sex, or drugs, or violence.  Confused?

<lj-cut text =""A wild Rant appeared!"">
The Pokemon world is a very different one than ours, and has been from the very beginning. In it, unlike in most games, you have no power of your own--you're a kid, much as many players are, and you often still live with your parents or parent.  Hardly an auspicious beginning, really--nothing indicates in the slightest what's in store for you.  In your town, you are asked by an elderly figure to assist them with a task; but, as it is dangerous to go alone, they give you a partner--a usually adorable, small creature that you are responsible for from that moment on.  That's right: All the power you possess is in caring for something else, and you choose which something else that is.  From step one, this journey is <i>yours</i>, and no one else's--It may go to similar places, it may see some similar things, but no two journeys are the same.

And then you take the first step into a world of mysteries, of light and sound, and into beautiful, strange creatures that, given the chance, would be glad to come with you.  It's a very powerful thing, a Pokeball--the notion that what you're fighting right now might change its mind, even grow to like you, if you give it the chance.  Anything can be your friend--the annoying bats, the wild rats, the plants and trees and the fish in the rivers.  Even, shockingly, the people.  Only very rarely is there someone who genuinely wishes you harm, in the Pokemon world, but they are out there--the Rockets, the Teams who would seize power, and use any means or method to do so.  That's the kind of evil that's real, that exists in our own world, and the notion of someone so small and unafraid standing against it is somehow human.  There is no dark sorcery, no power they possess you cannot--simply a drive to be over others, to rule.

The world is a large one.  It has caves, forests, hidden passages, and stray litter.  It has people and creatures, and it has a vibrant feel that makes you really want to see more of it.  The force of discovery is very much alive, and there are lessons to be learned everywhere; hard lessons.  Lessons in dedication--I was one of the few people who took a Magikarp with me, and was genuinely shocked when I saw what it could become--and lessons in beauty and in growth, as your partners and friends grow and change with you.  They learn new things--stronger moves, usually, but sometimes protecting abilities, or even skills that do themselves no good, but will rescue or aid a companion. They learn things to help you explore new places, find new things, and open your eyes to just how small you are, how big the place you're in is, and how fun it can be to be in it.

The Pokemon games are not 'hard', by any stretch of the imagination.  Every town is kind and will help you recover completely for nothing, and the roads between them are often short.  If you lose, you can become stronger and return. There are a few things which you have only one chance at, but you have plenty of warning that these are special things.  You can do as much--or as little--as you want, and actually get away with it. You can invest the time to learn the battler strategies that other players use, and pour your time and effort into using them--they often are terrible, in the wild--or bring your own.  It is up to you.

And that's the kind of game that matters the most.

It's a game ruled by your decisions; a game ruled by how far you want to go, how deep you want to dig.  It's a game about people, not just pokemon, a game about connecting and learning and meeting and discovering.  It's a game that has only one story and infinite stories--yours, and everyone else's.  It doesn't have many flashy cutscenes, or foul monsters killing your loved ones, or angsty teenagers--but what it has is Something Good, something that has endured and grown over more than ten years to become something distinct, and old-world, and beautiful. It's about <i>you</i>.

And I am glad I still play it.

Regardless of who it is for and if I knew them personally or not, I feel like an absolute stranger in the midst of the suits and the tears and the stories.  You see, she made me feel welcome and like a part of the family from the get-go; something that is next to impossible to accomplish for someone like me who has a difficult time connecting to anyone on a personal level quickly.  Ignoring the person in question (which I am loathe to do, as she was a very kind, open, and gentle spirit), Death itself leaves me at odds.  

Whether it be animal or person, being near a cast-off shell after mortality's fleeting run has ended for something leaves me tremendously conflicted.  Part of me feels very solemn; even reverent, and lost in contemplation of what I am doing with my own life.  At the same time, however, I want desperately to scream out, to bite into a chunk of meat, to drink and howl like a wild animal in a provocation that I, <i>I</i> am still alive and will enjoy what little flickering light I have on this muddled earth.  So, like I said: at odds.  I'm the person who suppresses jokes all ceremony, when my mind doesn't desperately try to avoid confronting the painful reminder that none of us really know how long we have to live, and the only way we can go on living is to pointedly ignore the fact that our time is ticking away.  I feel nervous.

So let's talk about something else.  I haven't been very productive, lately.  I mean, my grades are all As and all, and most of the material is enjoyable enough, but I haven't written or drawn anything by myself in months.  I need a sketchbook and a desk to work at, and the middle floor's heat is absurd for some reason: when it feels like you are exiting an oven when you go up or downstairs, there is an issue at hand you should probably address.  And now, for POKEMON.

Pokemon are awesome.  That is all.  I like to indulge in thought experiments of movesets and such, but the Mama Mew's honest truth?  Nothing beats the thrill of, like the lady said, winning with your favourites.  Laugh you ass off at my weakness-splattered Golem all you wanna, but I'll be grinning, 'cause I'll be remembering how easybreezy it made taking down the pokemon champion without breaking a sweat.  Yeah that's right. Dragonite you can go star in a movie with a sleepy child that will only be remembered for its pseudo-psychadelic intro and songs for all I care, Rock pokemon RULE.

And now, off to make macaroni! nom nom nom"

"event","So instead of doing my homework, which is what I should clearly be doing, I have been reading the interesting and fabulous blog Jen made some time back--http://www.blaghag.com/, you can tell the girl has something to say, she has her own domain name!--and in the comments, I found this gem: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yrwzi3clPQ. CAUTION: not exactly safe for work.  I'm not going to say something passive, like 'no offence to christians'--I've met one or two in my youth who tried to enlist and coerce me.  And yes, I intend to use such language--a priest who puts you in a chokehold at fourteen is about as close to 'good and right' as I am to being a woman with blond hair, melanin-infused skin, and a penchant for disco dancing.

On surfing his other stuff, he does a lot more thought provoking songs, such as 'I hate your blog'--a fine example of why I don't post more; no one wants to read my daily minutia, which is about as exciting as watching paint crack.  This is also why the only thing I will touch twitter with is a red-hot smouldering branding iron.  The brand?  Appropriate for the internet, it reads ""DO NOT WANT"".  Moving on!  Neth continues to be awesome, sent a gift to Dyzz.  I like how no one but Neth knows who Dyzz refers to; my lady seems to have lost internet presence completely.  And when I say ""like"": I am being ironic.  I know, no tone on the internet, right?"

"event","So this is one of those 'My dream is freaking weird' posts, and you can feel free to disregard if that's not your cup of tea.  Let me see:  Things started on a schoolbus--either high or middle, I don't know--with my older brother sitting in the other aisle.  We were both near the front, and after everyone was dropped off, the driver--a harrowing woman, middle aged, with one of those middle-aged faces--insisted I stay on the bus, as I had been damaging it. (She used different terms, but I don't quite know what they were.)   Despite my insistence, she drove me all the way to the house, which was near a very large governmental building--a bank, perhaps, it was officebuilding-like.  She told me to wait in the bus, and left.  

I followed her, of course, having no idea where I was or what on earth she thought she was doing, and all I could get from her as we traveled through what I presume now to be her house was a diatribe about how she had been watching me ruin her seats.  At some point after a particularly furious rant--all through which I had tried to reason with her--the woman gave me the slip.  I continued my exploration, and found a back balcony--it was across from another one attached to the same building, and on the overhang below and between the two, there was a bloodsplatter that convinced me the woman had fallen to her death.  I began to fear I would be suspected for murder.

I struck out from the house at that point.  I left from the balcony, somehow--the snow was waist deep, I recall that much, and slogged through it to the front yard.  At that point, I approached the policemen standing nearby and told them what had happened--and they explained they knew it already, and to relax, since the blood was from the woman's pet houndoom.  Yes, the Pokemon.  The woman came out with hot cocoa or possibly coffee, and at that point I started calling home.

Like I said: My subconscious is odd."

"event","There's a man seated at the table, there.  There, where the long shadows overlook the bar; there where the sound of a washrag on glassware and the low Thrumm of the jazz beat is his only company.  There, in his fedora, in his twisted horn-rimmed glasses and high-necked trench, sitting there, waiting.  Who knows what or who or where he's waiting for--maybe it's you.  Here, in this abandoned corner of the world, the man with the drink--a One Sharp, light on the twist, no rocks--is waiting.

The piano tempo, he thinks, is just right.  Low. Sweet.  Like the old days, when people knew the mood of the world, plucking heartstrings and bass strings without a thought for tomorrow or yesterday, while the elite partied upstairs, and the less fortunate begged and bemoaned their fates below.

Yes, it wasn't a bad life.  Not a bad life at all, with a flash of the tumbler."

"event","I had a dream which was fleeting in its reality. It went something like this.

Long ago, I was a man who was a doctor, who had a secretary who was beautiful.  Yet, whenever I was in the office, I misread the checks I received as for hundreds, not thousands, of dollars--it was an odd dream, because in the dreaming words have no power, yet I remember the checks as being legible.  In any case, I began to question--why could I remember no medicine?  Like when I was a XXXXXX--I may have imprinted my own life experience onto this dream--I knew nothing of my trade, yet was profoundly successful at it. And this was not the beginning of the dream, but the middle.  In the beginning of the dream, I hearken back to a seedling on the ground I left to grow, rather than take up for my own.  And my secretary, she asked if I was happy being a doctor.  If I was... content, with my life, my... children?  No, I do not think it was children.

She asked, and I told her I had this question within me, this question that asked and vexed me, of why I could remember no medicine.  Something happened, And I woke up--woke up in the boughs of a tree miles and miles upon miles high, hundreds of thousands of feet, a spiralling, world-shaping tree.  On the branch near me, I found a seedling--the same, or the seedling of a seedling, so long ago I had left there.

Someone whispered the words:  ""Go, lifewinner.""  It was a word with import I could not place, not quite classify, that I am desperate not to forget.

I wonder if this is just a dream.

I wonder whose soul is whispering to me, in the middle of the night.

When I awoke, I was with my lover, in my bed, and I held tightly to her, full of the joy of life. I told her my dream, because in my waking, I did not want to lose it--and she took it all in.  And now I tell it here, because I still do not want to lose it."

"event","So I used to be a mod for a gaia comm.  Pokemon Defenders--for a while we were the best around, till drama dumped all over us and made the universe suck forever.

But we have like thirty join requests so I'm going through them in the absence of anyone else taking a swing. I owe it to the comm to show up again, even if Gaia bites big south wind, these days.  We have pretty simple rules, and include a basic 'do this or you don't get in' rule to check if people have legitimately read them like sane, non-stupid people before they get in.

This is one of the applications. Blissey-fully, it's not a common example.

"event","Okay. Shopvaccing tank out, check.  Haven't got the disposal working again--had to reset it, gonna run some hot water down it in a bit in case it's grease.  Got locked out of campus login due to stupid obscure passwords, I suck at remembering those.

I need to take better care of myself.  Establishing new patterns can be tricky, though.  I'm trying now to just do some stuff every day before I settle into my Internet Slouch--I'm an addict I know--but it's not enough.  Tonight I hope to go through my course catalogue and see what appeals to me.

Maybe I should be a programmer.

Pseudo says I have the right mindset, and he'd know--it takes one, I guess.  But he's got like thirteen years of headstart when it comes to that sort of thing.  I've never gotten my act together enough to learn HTML properly and make a webpage, let alone learn coding language.  But I have to do SOMETHING--I don't want to waffle forever and wind up as unskilled labor or a lawncare guy or something.  (No offence to lawncare guys--I'm just a totally indoorsy sort is all.)  I want to have a skillset, and have that skillset be reliable, transferrable, and dependably needed. I want to work at a job where I can feel consistently useful without exhausting myself.  I'm trying to sort out what that is, I guess.  Money is nice, but I can get by on lean pickings if need be--I'd prefer not to, I'm a big guy.

I could sink into regret here, I suppose, and lament lost time, but the past is frozen.  Mountain at talon.  Classes start on feb first, so I should decide what I want and gun for it, weather or not I passed my math course."

One, to do something worthwhile every day--not huge things, every day, but worthwhile things.  Things worth doing either around the house, or outside it--shopping, learning new things in my classes, or things I don't normally do, like go to parties and meet new people.

Two, I resolve DO IT NOW.  Whatever needs be done, to do it and get it done with. I have a bad habit of putting things off for tomorrow that does not serve me very well, almost ever.

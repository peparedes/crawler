"event","Like he said he ""didnt want to be in a relationship"" and all. But in the end it is best because after all the b.s. we went through. Now I am not associated with it and all and I dont have to wait on him to tell me off all the crap he did. Like I kinda wanted to break up with him after all the junk that went on at the carnival and all but like now I am sort of happier. I agreed with him and all so yeah..

"event","I had this dream where me and someone(but its not the someone you think) were laying down in a field. Suddenly I kissed that someone and their girlfriend appears. She was complaining so i grabbed him by the hand and we jumped off this cliff together and he caught me at the bottom. SO anyways we ran into this barn and Kayla and Adam were there and she was screaming at us and I was saying I didnt know anything and so i ran with the guy again and we were in the back off this car being pulled buy frogs and then he said i love you and i said i love you to but for some reason i really meant it and we walked down this hill and Kayla and Adam were getting married and we watched them do it and then ADAM dissappeard and kayla married ashlee...but she was cool about it. Then adam came back and beat the hell out of ashlee and so me and the guy went away(mind you i didnt see the guys face until the end) and were laying down and then he took off his hat! OMIGOD!

That is the only time i woke up from a dream about to scream wtf??? seriously when i saw who it was i got scared~"

<P><STRONG>Mom and Granny left me here to go buy flowers probably some like these above. I am bored.&nbsp; Personally for the last week I have thought of sneaking out of the house and going somewhere. I am to bored and mom will not allow me to listen to Snow Patrol and Scary Kids Scaring Kids in the house without headphones on because ""it is too loud and Granny is here"". Does she really think I care about what Granny thinks? Lately she has been saying ""Granny is extra-sensitive Shelby and you need to be extra nice to her"". WTF? Granny is the person who sits there and goes ""Girlfriend you need to go to church this morning!!"" while she can sit on her lazy butt and watch Charles Stanley. And tomorrow I have to go drive 3 hours to go eat with Rob and Diane and Jarred. Jarred is so annoying and can anyone guess why they are coming? GRANNY INVITED THEM! Good lord why cant I just drown in the bath tub? Granny is paranoid she thinks that no matter what 24/7 that something bad is going to happen. No matter what someone is gonna break in, steal something, murder us or anything... then she yells at Luke! She is like Luke you useless blob and I am like wtf do you think you are? Grr...granny pisses me off. And I am mad at her....</STRONG></P>

As a matter of fact I do not want to go to church at 4 o'clock and leave at 9. That is freaking lame. I am so tired of her bitching because I dont want to do something she wants me to. I am not going. I do not care if granny isnt coming home until late tonight (and granny's coming home at 6) because I can stay by my self and I do not need a baby sitter. But NO I cant do anything I want to. She threw a fit and told me I needed to call Shane and tell him we had to go to the movies Thursday night because I couldn't do anything else with hime for 3 weeks. She has no freaking right to tell me I cant do anything else with him for 3 weeks. And then she decides it's time to ask me questions and councel me. She totally ignores me one moment and then she just burst into my life the next. I do not want to tell her fucking everything that happens in my life. She needs to learn that if there is something I need to tell her I will. She doesnt need to ask me everything. She expects me to do everything for her it is so annoying. Like just now she goes are you on the internet...are you talking to one of your friends?...well before you get go to lowes hardware.com for me. Then she goes are you going to the tanning bed with me? I want to go but if you dont want to I wont. I am like freaking go already! Get the hell out of this house before I want to shoot you. This sucks. I cant do anything I want to do because my mom is being a butt. Like yesterday she stopped for like 5 minutes to see a turtle. A freaking turtle. A TURTLE! I was like mom I need to be at the movies right now and she is like shelby we'll get there when we get there dont be a bitch about it. OMG she is the one being a bitch! She is pissing me off!

"event","Ya know how everyone cries...i dont anymore. Well I don't I can't...I like to leave it bottled up inside like nothing happened. It easier to not let people see how you feel than to let them know you care. It's like sometimes I shut myself off from the rest of the world and everything that goes along with it. Then suddenly I bust and I can't control it, it's like no matter what I'm not good enough. Everytime I turn around it's like someone is telling me ""You're good but not great."" or ""Look at her now you should be like her."" I can't ever be what everyone wants me to be 24/7 I have to find a balance somewhere. I can't be the preppy cheerleader type,I can't be the most popular girl who every guy wants to be with and I start to find out this one fact. Some may say that people can change. No, people can only change their body, look, style, life, clothes, and forget all reality to the fact that we live on planet earth. People can't ever change their heart what's inside them. They only change the fact that ""Live happy, die young"" isn't all it's made out to be. I guess one factor is that people will judge you no matter what you do as long as you dont stay in there ""ideal"" life style. No one on the earth is exactly a like in any possible way or form. People may change what ever they want to about themselves until they are truely happy...but who really knows what truely happy is. For some people I may be the total idea of perfect, for others I may be the biggest nerd on the earth. Who ever is reading this should know not everyone you meet you will like. Instead of denying how we feel we should express it, but what if we can't? What if the truth between these lives is that we shouldn't express ourselfs...what if cring is a sign of weakness. Depression is related to the factor of the little blob. Depressed people maybe they can't express themselves. Maybe I am like them...I dont know!"

Once upon a time there was a dog named Muffy. Muffy one day went to get the paper for his master. Then Muffy got hit by a car. THE END!
You my wonder how this relates to everyday life here is how :
One day you will piss someone off. When you walk outside to get the morning paper, they will flatten you in there beat up car. If you are wondering how I know this here is how...I hate you and one day I am going to kill you while you go get the paper! This is your one warning piss me off any farther and you must and will die. I am not forgiving in any way and hurt me once and I will crush you until you can not be crushed anymore. If you wonder how I will get away with such an genius crime I wish for you to know that I have diplomaic immunity in 48 countries including Cuba. If you think this is a joke you are sadly mistaken and I pity your brave soul. You may become a child and wish to play childish games such as hide and go seek...I wish for you to know that I will find you no matter where you go, no matter what you do, no matter who you become. I have spys everywhere watching, waiting for you to make that one small mistake and then you will be killed. However brutal you think my attemps to kill you are you must remember this one small reminder...somebody's eyes are watching you and when you do make that oh so small but yet so important mistake I will get you. If by some slight chance that you do escape my first attempt to kill you be certain that it will not be my last. I will try to kill you until I finally do and when you are dead lying in the middle of the street i will laugh a most horrible laugh that you can not possibly imagine. In reading my journal you have been for warned. Before you enter it I must question you one last time. You want the truth, but can you handle my truth?"

PEEPS IN THE CITY:
Peep 1 : Oh my gosh, like I can not believe we're in the city!
Peep 2 : What city are we in exactly?
Peep 3 : Duh, the city responsible for making peeps...New York City!
Peep 1 : Like hello, New York didn't make peeps, they just started rape and getting killed SHISH!
Peep 3 : And the BIG Christmas tree don't forget that!
Peep 2 : What can we do around here?
Peep 3 : We can go to the Peep show at the Pink Peep!
 ( Peeps walk into strip club the Pink Peep ) 
Peep 1 : Like oh my gosh, they're all girls ewww!
Peep 3 : Duh, the PINK peep, not the BOY peep or the MALE peep...The PINK peep.
Peep 2 : Yeah the PURPLE pink is down the street too.
Peep 1 : Like I am SOOO out of here!
 ( Peep 1 walks out of The Pink Peep )
Peep 3 : Come on we have to go get her, she can't survive in the BIG apple she might get eaten by a worm!
Peep 2 : Oh ok hang on...
 ( Talks to stripper peep)
Peep 2 : I'll be back later
 (Turns to Peep 3 )
Peep 2: Ok, lets go!

Why doesn't he write a song and release it saying that ""yes looks do matter and I am not going to go out with you if you look like a troll and smell worse than Kristina""? This saddens me because then girls all over the world will be like oh he doesn't want a super model, or just anyone in the world, he wants someone with a beautiful soul (like me)! Then they'll surround all their lives over him and he'll marry some person and their hopes and dreams will be shattered.

Your views are most similar to those of Christianity. Do more research on Christianity and possibly consider being baptized and accepting Jesus, if you aren't already Christian.
Christianity is the second of the Abrahamic faiths; it follows Judaism and is followed by Islam. It differs in its belief of Jesus, as not a prophet nor historical figure, but as God in human form. The Holy Trinity is the concept that God takes three forms: the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Ghost (sometimes called Holy Spirit). Jesus taught the idea of instead of seeking revenge, one should love his or her neighbors and enemies. Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross to save humankind and forgive people's sins.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='83' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>83%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='46' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>46%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='42' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>42%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='42' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>42%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='38' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>38%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='25' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>25%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='25' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>25%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='4' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>4%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='0' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>0%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

"event","<FONT color=#333399 size=2><STRONG>Wow...we finally have a snow day! Thank God they decided to close school on the day that I don't have gym. Unfortunately, the school board decided to put it off AFTER I did my science homework. So therefore, I can sit around, sleep, and talk to people. However these things can be done at school anyway, because that is why I go to school. TO GET AWAY FROM MY MOTHER. Last night, due to sleet, we didn't go to church. Thankfully I already know of Greg's lesson so I can tell you now. See Greg is such a smart man that he thinks that we younger and better dressed people, are completely stupid. Greg is an idiot and thinks that we couldn't tell the difference between Mickey Mouse and the Bible. Well here am I to tell you the difference. Mickey Mouse is much less educated than the bible. There is Minnie Mouse, Daisey Duck, Donald Duck, and Goofy (whatever he is). The Bible on the other hand has Jesus, God, Adam, Eve, and a whole bunch of dead people. Plus Mickey Mouse has less thy's and other words that show us how slang has taken over the world. Also a little 3 year old could understand Mickey Mouse. I personally think that we should teach a lesson on how Greg needs to pull his head out of his butt. The whole reason on reading the Bible is to get closer to God and hope that people may be saved. Greg's Bible ""tells"" him that no matter what you do you WILL go to HELL! Greg goes against Jesus's words and then tells us how to live our life! There is completely no use in hearing him talk unless he is ordering food, which he probably can not do because he is such a complete idiot. Someone tell me how the heck you can get a preaching license on such a horrible understanding of the Bible, and then go tell people about it. He has got to go!!!</STRONG></FONT>"

Pope not Pot:
We like the Pope not Pot
The Pope is cool, Pot is not!
Pope is like a breath of fresh air
Pot is like being a nasty nose hair!
The Pope sits on the front porch playing a kazzo
Pot you smoke it and go woo-hoo-hoo!
So dear little children, please look before you leap
On MTV when they cuss it goes BEEP!
So in the end what's cool and what's not 
Think before you try it 
The Pope Not Pot!!!"

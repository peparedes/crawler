You know you're in love when you can say anything to the person and you know they won't laugh at you. When you can see their face when you close your eyes. When you can still feel their arms around you holding tight after they are gone. When you can still taste their kiss after you have said good-bye. You can tell you're in love when you miss them before they are gone. When their voice lingers in your ears. When their presence eases any pain. When their name sends chills down your spine. When they are the only things you can think about. You know you're in love when you can see all their hopes and dreams and their soul when you look into their eyes. When they call you at four in the morning and say I love you and mean it. When your tears stain not only their shirt, but also their heart. When they are hurt just because of these tears. When even a simple chore done with them can become a lasting memory. Ultimately, you know you're in love when you can't imagine living without them, and can't figure out how you live before you knew them. When they fulfill every need and without them, you are incomplete. The love of someone else completes the heart, and soul, and mind all at once.

..and that my friends, is a perfect description of love.

"event","If you read my entry from last night, you'll notice that it's gone now. I deleted it because I totally disagree with it now. It's amazing how one little detail can change your whole thought of something. Now, out of boredom, I will post random quotes that I've found from firehotquotes.com - good site, TOO MANY POPUPS. ..and then, I will make some breakfast.

-Do you come with a instruction manual because you're confusing me!

-You don't deserve me, I know that it's true, but I want you so bad.. what do I do?

..eh.
I have to go register for high school next year. I'll update later. OH! And the entry down there isn't deleted yet because.. eh I don't have the time right now. BUT IT WILL BE."

"event","It's 6:38 in the morning, my chest hurts, and I'm dead tired. How are you?
 Nobody is online, well, two people are, but they have their away messages on. I have to leave here at around 8:30 and go register for my next school year. I'm going to be a Sophomore, which is kinda awesome. I'm not gonna be a Sophomore that thinks she is the shit though. Like the Sophomores were at my school. They thought they were so much better than the freshman because they were older. Well, hello, you guys were just freshman last year, you're not that much older, and you're not really that smarter either. Oh well.
 So yeah, I slept from midnight to three am. For that I could have stayed up and talked to Mikey or something. Eh, actually I couldn't, because my sister was getting all mad because I was on until midnight when my mom told me that I might want to go to bed at 11:30. And then when I want to stay up, she used to be on until 2? How hypocritical of her.
 But yeah, so I woke up at like 3.. and I had really bad chest pains.. so I had to get out of bed and take a puff of my inhaler, and then I was wide awake. So I played Tetris on the other computer until she was done..and I came online. And then..nobody was online. I thought maybe someone would be online. But it was nobody. Well, Bert came on for a little bit, and that was cool because I had someone to talk to for about a half hour.
 And now.. my dog is licking my elbow.. ew. I might go sleep until 8. I already showered last night so that's all done with..  Eh and Friday I have to go to this girl Anna's house so I will probably not be on late Thursday night. Which means, I have to wait until Friday night to call Mikey. Oh well. THANKIE BERT FOR THE PHONE CARD!
 Insert some fingers/comments!
Mwahs,

"event","Thanks to Jace for his contribution to my journal.. he gave me the code.
And a big thanks to Adam for doing the background and comments for me.
 
DeGener8Girl4Lif:  Have anything you want to say, that I can put in my first entry? 
 bad roIe model:  I don't care.  lol 
DeGener8Girl4Lif:  Okay, well then.. you suck. 

 Hooker Theft:  Manda's piece looks like a pickle. 

Yeah, my nice friends :) Mandy and Adam. But I can't say Adam sucks because he will delete my journal. so anyway.

My fascinations at the moment:
Literati
Drawing Game

Mandy introduced me to those games. How fun. Adam owns in Literati though.. He got like.. 54 points for one word. Beat my 3 point ""in"". 
My friend Ryan likes playing Literati now..he tries to beat me. I own, when I'm not playing against Adam or Bert or Marc.
Speaking of Bert. He is really good looking, and he lives like 20 minutes away from me. As my dubie would say ""hook it up y0""
Age though yo, He's like.. 20, and I'm like.. not. It's cool though, Bert doesn't want me anymore, he saw my pics.


Okay, I gotta go cook some steaks, Adios.

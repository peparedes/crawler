"event","I meant to see Lord of the Rings today, but I didn't feel like it.  My goal is to see all of the movies which had Oscars involved.  Usually I never see any of them, but this year I've seen...let's see...Monster's Ball, Amelie, Gosford Park, Moulin Rouge, In the Bedroom, Bridget Jones's Diary, Shrek, Vanilla Sky, Memento, A.I., The Royal Tenenbaums.  I think that's it.  I still would like to see Lord of the Rings, A Beautiful Mind, Ghost World, Mulholland Drive, Monsters Inc, The Man Who Wasn't There, Harry Potter, Sexy Beast, Iris, Ali, No Man's Land, and Training Day.  So many movies, so little time!!  [and money.]   I love 'em, I love 'em, I love 'em!

So my summer will be working, 8am-4pm, 5 days a week.  My dad alerted me to the fact that I must get a full time job this summer, which is only fair.  My dad has been working hard for the last thirty years, the least I could do is work at a mediocre job for 3 and a half months.  I'm so poor right now I wouldn't even have a pot to piss in.

My brother got into law school, so the future is looking up for him.  Good thing.  What a fucking bitch he can be.

My sister saw a psychic medium the other week and she was telling me stories about what the woman said.  Only now, at 4am, they don't seem like mere stories anymore and I'm f'n' spooked right now.  golly, its windy out tonight...

home is again too good and will make going back hard.

Oh, I saw Mike Charbonneau today!  He was driving to Brian Torre's house when he passed my mom and me while we were taking a walk.  He slowed his car down and waved.  He was always such a nice kid."

"event","My [only] class today was cancelled.  Which means I got up at 8:30 fer nuthin.  I knew she would cancel it too.  My professor went out of town for the beginning of the week and cancelled class until this morning's.  I knew she wouldn't come today, this self-professed hedonist professor of mine.  Can't say it really bothers me.

I filled out my timesheet at work yesterday and figured that I would be getting a bunch of money because I haven't been paid since December.  A whopping $84.  That's enough for a pair of pants and a shirt.  Money shouldn't be as important as it is, but damn, I'd sure really like some right now.

One more fucking day and then its spring break time.  One day too much.  My mom, my sister and I are going shopping at some outlets off the turnpike (either Waltham or Lee) after they pick me up.  Which means I don't have to spend any of my own money, which will be a relief.

Okay, time for a sleep that can only come when you're not in class when you should be."

I'll be cheering him from home because he knows how passionate I am about my studies, and he says that whenever he sees me in the stands he gets all nervous. (A skin tight body suit doesn't keep much a secret.)  

We have an understanding, see.  We like each other so much its unspoken.


And I finally fucking finished my philosophy take-home which I finished 8 minutes before it was due.  It was rather shitty at the end because I just wanted it done. I'm pretty tired too because I was up until 6 doing it and had to get up at 10:30 to study for a history quiz. I really need to manage my time better. But I'm gonna stay awake though...you know, the whole boyfriend thing, he'd get all pouty if I didn't watch him on TV and kiss him on the screen.  (He says it gives him good luck.)"

"event","They still have yet to turn on the heat in my dorm, so I had such a bad sleep last night and now my head is hurting.  I can't say that I'm that excited to be back.  

I keep getting this weird foreboding feeling like something bad is going to happen.  Its not huge, but its this little tiny burp of a feeling.  I think its because I got too comfortable being home, especially knowing that, although I really do like Boston, it'll never be completely comfortable here.  Now I have to get used to it all over again because I let myself forget about it too much during the break.  Although it is snowing and I love snow.  But it brings back the feeling of a little Christmas.  Now I'm feeling the absence of my Christmas tree, the one that I condemned, and am kinda missing it.  God...I would like to get a second stab at Christmas.  I hate snow!

I saw Orange County last night because it was part of the new students orientation to go see a movie and they had an extra ticket.  I couldn't turn down a free movie.  I got what I paid for, this movie was pretty bad.  Colin Hanks is normal-cute though and he did a decent job with what he had.  He has an amazingly symmetrical face.  Schuyler Fisk looks a lot like her mom only different coloring.  I can't believe how many famous people were in this movie.  Did they really need paychecks that bad that they would be in this movie?   Ben Stiller was in it uncredited and I have to say that he truly looked hot in it.  Enough about this.

I'm starving.  I have to go down to the cafeteria.  Back to fucking cafeteria food.  I can handle it.  It'll be key in my getting a new svelte body.  thinking positive thinking positive thinking positive...

"event","I've been looking at websites for the last 3hours on empowering oneself.  You know, the whole inner wisdom kind of spiritual stuff.  I went to women.com, which sounded like it would be pretty interesting to me.  It was surprisingly a bit frivilous and silly.  Lots of celebrity gossip and make-up tips.  Yeah, I read it for about 2 hours.  So now I have to get it out of my head that I'll only be an intriguing and wonderful person if I purchase M.A.C. make-up products.

Jennifer Aniston wore a beautiful dress on her date with Joey tonight.  A nice elegant black dress that looked really gorgeous on her.  Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be the media's image of beautiful.  And then go home and make it with my husband who is also the media's image of beautiful.  It must feel really good.  ha.  probably not like my dream last night where I tried to masturbate but I was so dry that it was flesh tearing.  Not even in my dreams, man, not even in my dreams.  I don't know why I just wrote that, but eh, oh well.  It happens.

My sister 'talked' to me about life for an hour or so tonight.  It was really just her bitching and moaning to me.  ""I don't want to live at home anymore....Mom never does anything...Mom's such a brat...teaching isn't about"" blah blah...  I didn't like listening to her.  I like it when some other people do it (Megan Amanda Nick Colin), but I want to get up and walk out of the room when she does it.  It makes me realize that my sister and I are COMPLETELY different people, and I really don't agree or understand what her problem is with a lot of stuff.  It just makes me kinda angry sometimes because I accept that I know my sister but I will never truly understand her, but she thinks she knows and understands me seemingly more than I know and understand myself.  Na-ah honey.  My mom said Karen was 'naturally dumb' nonchalantly, without knowing what she was saying, and my sister got pretty pissed off.  I'm a bad person, I laughed a little. 

So yeah, I've decided that my New Year's resolution, besides growing my hair longer, is to become a little more positive.  When I go back to school I'll have to ask around if anyone has any Chicken Shit...I mean soup...for the Soul books.  Okay, its not going to be as easy as I thought.  But I can do it.  I'm going to practice by naming some of my memories I love:

Megan's reaction to Lenny Kravitz's horrid outtie 

Going hiking at Taconic Mt St Park with Amanda, Nick, and Jay. Then driving through Vermont, seeing those rainbows while eating a loaf of fresh baked bread

letting Brandon convince me to leave my number on Shawn Fazioli's car, which is still the gutsiest guy thing I've ever done to this day...funny story too.

Amber's 17th birthday- me, Amber, Heather, and Megan ate two Papa John's pizzas in about 10 minutes tops, and the raw green pepper.  And then watching the drunk woman spiral into the ground at the BitchandAnimal show  -was that at the show?  god, it was fucking funny though

when I first got to college and walking to Quincy Market all by myself, and feeling free and healthy and inspired. (where the fuck did that go?...wait, I don't know, that's what this whole positive thing is about..fuckin' a, why does it have to take time and energy)

my grandma telling me about her showdown with a medicine bottle that when she couldn't open it with her hands, she challenged  with an ""Oh yeah?"" and took a can opener to pop the muthafucker open.

My Shen Carillon Senior Quote is done.

Okay, one more:

 CP PIMPIN' 4-EVA!!! 

one more memory I love:

Watching the shape of Shen get smaller and smaller through my rear-view mirror as I'm leaving it on the last day of school there forever.  In my Corsica.  Thank fucking god that's done with.  I miss my Corsica though.

"event","The first thing my dad said after he saw my grades was ""Why do you keep doing this to me?.....and to you and your mother."" Right.  I'm an afterthought.  And my mom is an after-afterthought.  I'm sorry Dad, were you trying to channel through me?  Because that's not the fucking way it goes!  Almost 20 years and you'd think my dad would've figured that out. It doesn't crush me like it used to, I just get pretty damn resentful.  So instead of getting sad and running up to my room to cry, I sit in front of the tv and swallow back a little acid reflux.

I can't wait to have my own place that I pay for with my own hard-earned money.  Or easily-earned money, which ever, just as long as its mine.  Living in this house and always having to answer to the alphamale/paterfamilias/breadwinner gives me this feeling that my life is not my own.  I hate it.  I'm not a fucking show pony whose only purpose is to make the owner feel better about all the obedience training and money he's put into   it.  My accomplishments are my accomplishments; my failures are my failures.  MINE.

I need to go back to school.  Home has lost its comfort.  I do nothing all day, and then I go upstairs to do nothing at night.  I think aliens came into my room one night and peformed a lobotomy on me.  Clifton Park is like fucking kryptonite.  At least at school, as frustrated as I get, I still get excited about the future.  Once I see the ""A great place to live, work, and play"" I want to vomit and soon after become catatonic.  I always miss my friends from CP dearly, but damn, this place is sucking the life out of me.  And replacing it with cellulite.

I was looking at pictures of me from the prom, graduation, the first day of college...I was cute back then.  I've gained 25 pounds since then. That's a really fat cat.  I have to lose a whole fat cat to even get back to cute.

We're getting married as soon as I figure out where I'm going with this whole ""life"" thing.  Until then he's boinking me wildly ten to the hour every hour.  (Just like MTV News!)

I guess I should mention that he's the late great George Harrison's son.   Yeah that means he's rich, talented, and dark-dark brown-eyed.  And above all it means that it's not gonna happen, which further means that I will again feel like a sociopath/(that's 'slash')stalker, something that happens way too often.  ""You talkin' to me?""   

Fuck, that's like the billionth time I've mentioned Taxi Driver in my livejournal.  They must be coming on to me!!  All those out there...

ahem...where was I?

Speaking of MTV News and silly crushes...where the fuck had they been hiding this Quddus fellow??  I will add Deprivation of A Fucking Good-Looking Male That I Will Waste Time Watching Shows I Care Nothing For Just To See Him Talk to the list of MTV's offenses, which includes mainly Phony Piece of Brain Washing Shit.  Speaking of Quddus and how he's so cute he makes my stomach jump, I will now hunt down information on him on the internet.

I watched Bridget Jone's Diary again by the way.  God, in the end, when Colin Firth grins...makes my heart melt.  He has one of those faces that completely transform when he smiles.  Shite.  AHHHHHH.  I fuckin' failed a class when I could've gotten all A's for the first time in 5 years!!!  And I ate a whole plate of brownies today!!! Why do I keep doing this to myself.

I'm wondering too when Amanda is coming home, most specifically if Brandon's birthday party is still on.  Honestly I kinda miss the kid.  hahah, how condescending.  But I do.  I like Brandon and anytime I've ever been mad at him its because I like him.  I really want to taste Megan's mom's wassail too.  I hate to admit it, but I really feel like getting quite a bit toasty.  I want to have understated, yet rip-roaring, New Year's fun times.  New Year's sucks, by the way, and is a made-up holiday.

Oh yeah, stalking Quddus..."

I could think of worse things than being Linda Fiorentino.  But the result fucking figures.


Okay, I'm back and feeling better stomach-wise.

But seriously, I really hate Christmas.
I looked in the mirror as I was washing my hands in the bathroom, and I failed to notice that I had confectioners sugar all over the front of my shirt from stuffing pecan sandies/Mexican wedding cakes/Russian tea cakes into my mouth like a gluttonous, greasy-haired manatee.

More about Mark Darcy leaning in to kiss Bridget...I like to think that will happen to me one day.  What a nice scene, what a nice movie.  Its one of my favorites.  I like to think that men will want to kiss me really bad.  Or that they wouldn't even have to be paid that much to give me a little peck on the cheek.  

True, guys are a lot easier than that.   Okay, I just want it to be easier to make it happen.  I want to be able to be found attractive and propositioned by an attractive male and not react as if the guy was out to wreck me, or that he feels sorry for me, or he's just really that desperate.  I have to recognize that I'm the only one who is wrecking me, I'm the one who feels sorry for me.  He's desperate.  haha, no.  Stop.   I hate my boobs.  I swear, they're the root of all my self-esteem issues within the last 3 years.  Also my recent fatness.  god, I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to talk about my self-esteem issues.  Maybe that's part of the problem.

One more thing about me.  I failed a class.  Intro to American Politics, which is what I'm supposed to major in.  I knew it too!!  I kinda fell apart at the end.  And I knew it.  I just wanted to drive out of Boston and leave everything behind, but noooo...  I did remember to pick up the license plate from the middle of the street though.     Anyway, 2 A-'s, 1 A, and a big fat F.  How's that for inconsistent?  I'm gonna put off telling my parents for as long as I can.  I'll just have to retake the class next fall semester.  It's going to be alright.  I can do this.  I will say that I am proud of myself that the other grades were A's.  You know, I'm really fucking proud of myself that the rest were A's!  Except for Mr. F there, these are the best grades I've gotten since 9th grade.
 
Self-esteem has raised a minute portion.  I think I'm gonna get Bridget Jones's Diary on DVD for Christmas because that's the only thing I mentioned when asked what I wanted for Christmas.  Then I'm gonna watch it and watch it and watch it some more because I like when Mark is incredibly attractive and gazes fondly at me...I mean Bridget.  Same thing.

MERRY CHRISTMAS  

One more good thing in life:  Possessing the Secret of Joy by Alice Walker.   GREAT fucking book, one of the best I've ever read, and I'm reading it again because its really that good."

ha, kidding.  I like life a lot, like the other day when I watched Bridget Jones's Diary with Megan, Nick, and Amanda.  I like life when Mark leans in to kiss Bridget and he's tall and successful and respectful

oh, stomachache...hold on...good thing I left my book down here."

Everyone's okay.  But I don't know how well I'm gonna do with this one.  Last time I hit a car I had a panic attack that lasted straight through 2 months.

I still can't believe I did that.

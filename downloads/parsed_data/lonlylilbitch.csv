"event","todays the 4th of july... i went to the warner center to go and see fireworks... it suxd so much ass becasue they set it up so that the fireworks went off right behind the damn trees. and it was only like 15 minutes...

when we were leaving my dad called his friends and they said to come over becasue they were lighting off fireworks...
so we went and they had taken some m-80s lit them and covered them with the buckets (like the ones mrs.cornell used)the one bucket flew like 30 ft into the air and then the other one the bottom blew out it was so funny

then there were these kids there one was like 9 and the other was like 11 or sumthing... the one that was 11 has a blue mohawk a gaudge in his ear really big one and seemed to be in the poser death metal catagory... the 9 year old was so funny he kept trying to get his mom to give him a sip of beer and then he was all ""common mom ur drunk"" and a little later saying ""but ur not even wearing a bra"" lol

there were some other guys there they were about 17-21 :D :D :D :D :D :D (if ya know what i mean)

okay so now i'm really bored... and i wanna go to magic mountain tomorrow but i prolly can't so w/e

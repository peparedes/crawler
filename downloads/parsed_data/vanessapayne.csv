"event","<p>On Saturday, after my early morning class, I headed out to meet up with the production team to work on our ""haunted project""&nbsp;&nbsp; I call it the ""haunted project"" because it's still untitled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; Max and I headed out to our rendezvous with JS and Denise, everyone hopped into our truck and off we went to St. Kitts where we met up with G, then then trailed off to the Blue Ghost Tunnel.<br /><br />We parked our vehicles as close as we could, then had to walk the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately JS has been there many times, otherwise I doubt we would have found the location, other than some grafitti on some railings marked ""blue ghost""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a bit of a hike down a pretty steep embankment, through brush and trees, with a faint trail down the slope.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the light rain, it was pretty muddy, making it pretty slipprey and dangerous getting down the embankment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guys made it down first... of course&nbsp; .. lol&nbsp;&nbsp; Denise and I held hands, slipping and tripping over branches and rocks the whole way down, it's amazing we didn't break our necks&nbsp;<br /><br />Once we got to the bottom of the hill,&nbsp; there it was... the infamous Blue Ghost Tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creepy and ghostly looking all by itself buried in the middle of no where.&nbsp;&nbsp; The west entrance had been sealed up with cinderblocks because of vandalisim and trespassing, but that didn't keep people out, the cinderblock has been chipped and broken away, leaving the tunnel open for people to get inside.<br /><br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""...a bit of history on Blue Ghost Tunnel..."">Blue Ghost Tunnel is located in St. Catherines Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=""2"">Built between 1875 and 1876, the Great Western Railway tunnel was designed to allow trains to cross beneath the 3rd Welland Canal (between locks 18 and 19). A single rail tunnel, over 700 feet long, the tunnel is constructed of limestone blocks shipped in from Queenston quarries.<br /><br />The tunnel has a history of death surrounding it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1903 there 2 trains collided head on killing 2 men and two rescue workers were badly burned and disfigured, and later died in hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></font><br />In 1912 an accident at lock 22&nbsp;sent a wave crashing down and drowning&nbsp;2 boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Eight men were killed during construction of a lock and two years later to the day, another eight men were killed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In total 107 men died during construction.<br /><br /><font size=""2"">In 1923, a man-made pond became necessary to act as a reservoir for the 4th canal. Built above the 3rd Canal, just behind the pumphouse, the reservoir required the relocation of St. Peters Church Cemetery. Apparently, only 250 headstones were moved (no graves), leaving over 600 lying beneath the waters of the reservoir today.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can still see the grave stones submerged in water just outside the tunnel.</font><br />&nbsp;<br />A new railway was eventually constructed, which is still in use today, and the old Merriton Tunnel abandonded.<br /><br /></div><p><br />After checking our gear, ensuring everything was working properly, we headed into the darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was still early afternoon.&nbsp; Immediately&nbsp; after entering the tunnel we started having problems with our gear.&nbsp; cameras failing, video freezing, our EMF reader was spiking off the charts.<br /><br />Water was dripping inside the tunnel and the deeper we went, the more water until eventually we could go no further.<br /><br />...to be continued...<br />sorry - ran out of time - will finish the update later today....</p>"

<lj-cut>

I.

Three years after his return from the world beyond the gate, Edward Elric is solemn and black-humoured and still short enough that Roy bites his tongue on calling him things like 'adorable lima bean' and 'my lovely little bacteria'; it's not funny these days, and his skin is no longer small. He bites his tongue on a lot of things: Edward's carefully doled-out alchemy, his theoretical genius that Roy still hasn't seen a word of, Alphonse, who is cheerful and reckless and still so very much Edward's younger brother for all that Edward Elric, the tempestuous temperamental son of Hohenheim, seems to have disappeared from the young man staring him down across the desk.

'You can't be serious,' he says, voice flattened by the remaining traces of an accent otherwise nonexistent in this world, by his frustrated objection. 'No way. Aren't I due a holiday?'

'Not until I see fit to allocate it.' Mustang puts on his best stern-commander face, and tries not to smile at his disbelief. The expression reminds him too much of the former Fuhrer, cold lines and colder angles, and he avoids the mirror hung indelible on the wall, rests his chin in his hands, gloves familiar and scratchy against his skin. 'I'm serious,' he says into the silence.

Edward sighs, irritated. 'Why? It's illogical.'

'Yes, it is,' and he just knows he's being infuriating. Watching for his scowl, his reflexive twitch, is one of life's small delights for Roy Mustang, the overgrown manchild in a Fuhrer's uniform. Edward's expression smooths all too soon, however, and Roy falls back. 'You will do as you are told, State Alchemist. Dismissed.'

He throws up his hands, but doesn't argue. These days he never argues beyond that initial point, never screams or shouts or goes off on long lines of improbable divergent excuses. He thinks it could have been Hohenheim's influence in that other world, the influence of a dead and dying man who was nevertheless a father, the influence of being an orphan in a world that no longer accommodates brilliant young alchemists to the point of military insanity. 'Fine. Just -- fine. Two weeks?' He doesn't wait for an answer. 'I'll have my report in next Friday.'

Roy shuffles paper and stops him at the door, careful to speak only while the door is still closed. The Fuhrer's offices are large and dark-panelled and soundproofed such that the tap of Hawkeye's heels as she passes by is a relief. 'Will you take Alphonse?'

Edward shrugs, one shouldered; his natural shoulder. He still has a habit of loosening his artificial arm, of acting without its function beyond a useless prop. 'No. I won't drag him into this. Sir.'

Roy sits in an empty office and stares at the door, lets his breath hiss between his teeth, and gets back to the work of running an army so full of surgically clean diplomats and alchemists and representatives that there is nothing for them to do but perform maintenance and create paperwork. Peace has broken out for the main, and it has taken will and five years lacking a certain alchemist with an infamous title not to say <em>this is not what I thought it would be</em>.

He doesn't quite know if Ed wanted to come back to routine missions across principalities trailing fame and influence, a quiet young man with political power second only to his, speech and presence and no action at all in his reason. Edward has become as precise and efficient as the rest of Central, restrained in peacetime to glorified public servants, and there is something to be said for that, a different kind of pride in guarding and guiding a cheerful populace.

But there is also nothing to be said for an Edward Elric who does not protest, who is by all appearances content never to transmute again.

II.

Hawkeye folds her arms across her chest. 'Sir.'

He knows that tone. 'What now?'

'Edward Elric's report, sir.' The thin sheaf of paper in her hands settles on the desk, and he knows that if he cares to read it, he will find the Fullmetal Alchemist's practiced handwriting and his careless report on yet another civil dispute resolved and otherwise stifled, histories written in the slope of his a, the ironwork loops of his <em>z</em>s. 'As scheduled.'

Roy taps his pen against the edge of his desk, flicks a requisition form to the side. <em>Denied</em>. He's become used to paperwork, and he likes it more than he doesn't; it's occasionally infuriating, often dull, but it means things are working, that if he can stretch far enough, he'll be able to see treacheries, things amiss in the slip-slide-slap of paper coming and going in hands that are not his. 'Something wrong with it?'

She stares at him, even and uncompromising. He wonders if her mother wanted this for her, guarding him with recessed genes and chance giving her the Ishbalan colour of her eyes. 'You're worried about him.'

'I'm worried about everything,' not really an answer, and he doesn't intend it to be. He's stretched far and wide, but he's also stretched thin, meetings and departments and oversight, oversight, oversight. Internal transparency. Corruption. Doctored budgets and hidden laboratories and a Fullmetal Alchemist who does what he's told, no more and no less, goes above and beyond in answering only his duty to the people, not his duty of command, and he can't find it in himself to be irritated at the lack. Heartsickness requires time he does not have, a devotional thought without the qualifier <em>for king and country</em>. 'Fullmetal can take care of himself.'

'What about Alphonse?'

Roy Mustang, Fuhrer, lets his head sink down onto the desk, the wet ink of his signature unpleasant against his forehead. 'How is he?'

Hawkeye frowns minutely. 'He's -- Sir,' she says briskly, 'the Elric brothers are not your responsibility. However --'

'I know.' He gives her a wry look from under his hair and straightens, peeling pages of requisitions off his forehead. Apparently the toilet paper situation in the junior dormitories was rather dire. 'Where is Fullmetal?'

Hawkeye's face clears into proper blankness. 'His assigned quarters. Shall I summon him?'

He waves a hand. 'Tomorrow. Sixish?'

'Sir,' crisp understanding, and he sags thanks, takes a moment to contemplate the unwritten heroism of Riza Hawkeye, and goes back to work.

III.

He jerks awake, yawning. 'What?'

Edward Elric regards him with distant concern standing above his bed, the hand of his artificial arm gleaming cold in the drifting, muffled morning light. 'You sleep like a pig. Major Hawkeye said you wanted to talk to me.'

Roy stalls. Having a desk between himself and Edward's coiled regard is a very different thing from it standing above his bed, aged and far too heavy-shouldered for his liking. 'How's Alphonse?'

'He's Al. Doing Al things.' He huffs. 'Still trying to be me, when I was younger. We haven't talked much.' Edward scratches his ear. 'I keep telling him to cut his hair, but he won't listen to me.'

'What changed?' He doesn't quite know what he means, exactly; only that he's Fuhrer, but he's still Roy Mustang, while Edward Elric is still a State Alchemist, still Fullmetal, but these days none of those are men Roy knows well.

'Everything,' Edward answers, unhesitating. 'Wrath is still somewhere, and Al, I don't think he understands. And you, you're -- you're not a cad anymore,' he says simply. 'Back then you would've called me short soon as you saw me.'

'You're short,' he says. He still feels tired. 'What time is it?'

'Quarter past six. I'm making breakfast. Want some?' Again, he doesn't wait for Roy to say anything, turning to the door on little cat feet. He's learnt to walk lightly, learnt it as necessary habit, and he half-wishes to hear the stomp of his boots. 'You stink, by the way.' 

Edward rummages loudly in his regulation kitchen and Roy stares at the ceiling, surprised and unsurprised all the same. He wonders if he cooks one-handed.

He doesn't get to find out. Breakfast is served by the time he's done wallowing, eggs and bacon and sausages and cream in his coffee and he takes a seat opposite Edward who eats with a fork and no knife, cutting and spearing and chewing in perfect distracted rhythm, concentrating on the newspaper sprawling over the table and hanging off the edge, and stares at him for a minute. Edward Elric is the Fullmetal Alchemist these days, and he is distracted and weapons-forged by using no weapon at all, and he is beautiful.

'You're a state alchemist,' Roy says, piling bacon onto his plate. 'Yet you don't perform alchemy.'

'Don't need to,' Edward says absently. 'It's inefficient. Complicates things.' He makes a face. 'Complicates everything.'

'Your duties --'

'They don't need to see it,' he interrupts, looking up for the first time, and his eyes are golden and sharp and foreign to him, weighted with six years of another culture, another world. 'They know who I am and they know what I can do, and demonstrating alchemy for the sake of polarising people is counterproductive.'

Roy is quiet. 'That's a politician's thinking.'

Edward's smile is sharp, flickering the way a candle does caught between index finger and thumb, and the turn of the page sounds like a crumpled wick. 'My father taught me a lot of things.'

IV.

Alphonse beams at him, wide and charming. It appears guileless, but Roy knows better. 'Alphonse Elric,' he drawls. One cad to another. 'How have you been?'

The youngest and for a time the last surviving Elric waves him in, closing the door behind him and bustling with the too-small movement of someone used to being a large, hollow weight, used to greater exchanges of mass and velocity, a touch on a trigger committing to an action unspeakable. 'I've been well, thank you, Mr. Mustang! Tea?'

'Yes, thank you.' Al serves tea with biscuits and little pots of sugar and cream and sits opposite him on the couches in his tiny living room.

He's bright and earnest in the open-curtained sunlight with something far too gleaming in his polished openness. The Elric brothers are creatures of habit. 'Can I help you? You said you wanted to ask me about something.'

'Have you spoken to your brother recently?'

Alphonse's worry looks put-upon. 'Is he okay?'

'Have you?'

'No.' His brightness dims. 'I haven't. I don't want to. He's still my brother, but he's different now. Everything's different now.'

Roy sips his tea. It's terrible, weak and fragile-tasting, softness too bitter. 'He loves you.'

'I love him too,' Alphonse says, simplistic. 'It doesn't make a difference. He left.'

'He died to save you,' Roy says, his second useless appeal, and thinks of Hughes.

'He left,' he repeats. 'I did my best, and it wasn't enough. I trained with Izuri, and I tried everything, and it -- he came back on his own somehow, and I thought he was dead, and he is. He's not Edward anymore. You've seen it too, haven't you?'

He chooses his words with care. 'Edward is willing. You should speak to him.'

Alphonse's tea is untouched. 'And say what, Mustang?' dropping formalities and shedding fleshy pride, and sometimes he catches himself looking for gauntlets and metal joins in the sides of his wrists, the impossibly squared jaw, the loincloth. Alphonse still wears clothes as though he would be far more comfortable without them, his trousers a little too tight, his shirt too loose, too many buttons undone. He has seen this boy naked in his humanity, in the form that defined him for so long, and he catches himself pondering the philosophy of emotion, reducing Alphonse to artificial artifact by habit. 

This man still is an artifact of a sort as an Elric brother, a historical curiosity, but his artificiality is chosen, drawn around him like protection in ouroboros, the tattoo on his skin. That it is black, not red, gives him no comfort. There are worlds where Alphonse is not more unto Wrath than Edward; this is not one of them.

He is no longer mistaken for Fullmetal.

'You could say that you forgive him,' Mustang says wearily. He's too old for this. 'That you want to.'

Alphonse is very precise as he picks up his cup of tea, presses the rim to his lips without sipping, and sets it down again. 'You are making assumptions,' and his voice is cold and warning and very much like his brother.

V.

'Nice try,' Edward informs him a month later. 'Seriously, nice try, you <em>piece of shit</em>. What the hell did you say to him?' He goes through a series of exasperated gestures and ends up putting his hands on his hips, flabbergasted. 'He was an ice-cold bitch every time I tried to call him, and all he said was that you were --' He flushes, voice lowering to a dispirited mutter. 'I didn't teach him that kind of language. Mum wouldn't've approved.'

Roy tilts back in his chair, swinging on the two back legs and folding his hands across his stomach. Hawkeye's irritated reprimands when he does it are another of life's small delights. The dispirited expression on Edward's face is not, and Hawkeye is not here.

'He doesn't like you, I think,' Edward concludes. 'Not anymore. And neither of you are going to tell me anything.'

Roy is not inclined to recount his failures, even when called to accounting by the relatives of the tarnished and discharged. It is not his tale to tell, and if he is entirely honest with himself, he doesn't quite know what happened either. He wields what he does know instead. 'You abandoned him to save his life, Fullmetal.'

'I --' He stops, looking pained. 'That's not exactly -- are you telling me I brought him back wrong? That I, what, turned him into a homonoculus? That's ridiculous. I gave everything, Mustang. Everything. It was a last-ditch attempt and it worked and this is <em>not</em> because I got it wrong, or because I fucked up.'

'He finds it easy to detach his soul,' Mustang suggests. 'Pieces of it. He animates inanimate objects, commands them to act as his own at will.'

Edward shrugs, stiff and thin-lipped. 'Last time I brought that up, he threw me out. Something about being a horrible brother, or -- I don't know, making him that way. That it was my fault.' He rubs his eyes. 'I don't know. He's just, he's Al. He didn't have to come back wrong to hate me, Mustang,' humour gross and inappropriate. 'I always thought he kind of did when we were growing up, anyway.'

He finds he can spare a moment or two for heartbreak, and takes refuge in professionalism. 'Fullmetal, your partnership with your brother greatly improved your efficiency and ability.'

'That's when he was still my brother Al,' thoughtful head-tilt, unfazed by his crisp address. 'These days he's Alphonse. That's okay.'

Roy doesn't hide his disbelief.

'No, it is,' and he sounds more tired than Roy feels. 'It really is. It's not like he could follow me around forever even if things hadn't happened that way. He was -- he was going to marry Winry.'

Roy raises an interested eyebrow. 'Have you talked to her?'

'Some,' he admits, stamping his automail foot. 'She's not that happy with me. Made me a new arm and leg when I came back, but she'd got a boyfriend, they were pretty serious, and she yelled at me for a week for being so late, for going at all. He was nice. Local, you know? We grew up with him, but Winry says she told Al and he didn't know who he was.' He spreads his hands. 'At this point, I'm willing to accept that things happen.'

Roy quirks a smile despite himself. 'That's your philosophy?'

Edward nods, self-satisfied. 'Yeah. Things happen. Pithy, isn't it? There was a scientist in the other world,' he muses, and Roy sits straight in his chair, rocking its legs straight as gently as possible. 'Niels Bohr.' The name means nothing to him. '""The opposite of one profound truth may well be another profound truth."" It's true that things happen, but it's also true that they don't. Me and Alphonse, that's one of the things that didn't happen.' He looks a little like himself, more settled in his body, a piecemeal unbalanced body, stance wide and confident. He's not quite speaking to Roy, more to the corner where Sloth once stood attendance. 'I'm okay with it.'

'How are you okay with it?' Mustang says. 'That's rather out of character for you. It's not the Edward Elric that I know. Knew,' he amends, because there was an Edward Elric and there is the Fullmetal Alchemist, and they are not always one and the same. Especially now.

Edward turns to face him. 'I'm not the Edward Elric that anyone in this world knows. And Winry is going to kill me for this eventually, but I'm not sure that's -- I got to meet my father. He died, but I met him. I knew him. And you still think I'm worthy of your direct command.'

Roy sighs. 'You're still the Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward. A dog of the military.'

He chuckles. 'Do you still believe that, Mustang?'

Roy is forced to admit defeat, crowded by the shadows of the homonoculi: King Bradley, Sloth, Lust, Wrath. Envy, whose story Edward will never tell him, although he makes that he knows and he understands it in part. He never expected to see resentment in the boy, but he finds it in the man clear as the glassy sheen of incomplete Philosopher's Stone. 

He hasn't been able to rid Central of them; he hasn't been able to exterminate their presence; all he can do is bury them in the tradition and fashion of Marco, in codes and long-forgotten shelves and the simple unwillingness to know. He wonders on occasion if Alphonse has hold of such a thing, and then dismisses the thought as unworthy. For all his changes in the past decade, he is still Edward Elric's brother, and he is still the son of Hohenheim, and he is, if not moral, at least ethical in his scientific rigour and the arrogance his brother once held.

'Dismissed, Fullmetal.'

VI.

The next morning, he again wakes to Fullmetal's serious regard, the smell of breakfast already cooking, the touch of his automail hand, a distance, a familiarity. He knows well the scents of oiled machinery, the creaking lukewarmth heat of a working machine, and waking to it is a comfort, like going to sleep knowing that Hughes would stay on the couch, would lie with him in his bed, too, and sometimes he was merciful enough to slide under the sheets without needing to be asked.

Edward Elric was a boy who flared against the threat of dusty wind and is now a man who blazes, oil-wicked and uncompromising: technological progress, the development of self and design and outer appearance, the shield for safety, the deep well. There is no sputter to his voice, wreathed in the laconism of someone who doesn't care in the slightest that he's waking up the Fuhrer, inconsiderate and uninvited. 'Morning, shithead. Breakfast'll be ready in fifteen.'

Roy groans his way out of bed and slumps under the shower, rubbing half-heartedly at the back of his neck and piling himself into a rough approximation of posture at the table. 'Why are you here?'

'Hawkeye says someone has to make sure you eat breakfast.' Edward eyes him, critical and unkind. 'You look like shit.'

He does. He knows this. 'You haven't slept, have you?'

Edward sets a cup of much-needed coffee in front of him, briskly stirring cream into his own. 'You shouldn't have provoked Al.'

Roy doesn't know if he can listen to this; it's not his field, and he's not cut out for dealing with the Elric brothers' intimate complications. 'I thought I could help.' He forces himself to honesty. 'I was curious.'

'Now you know.' Edward seems unfazed, draining his coffee deep. 'I'm going now. Work to do, reports to write. You'll get to read them later.'

'Shall I read them later?' He doesn't mention that they're very proper, very dry, and so relieved of sarcasm that they make his teeth hurt.

'I could add some fart jokes,' he offers, stopping at the door. The lack of his red coat makes him look older, more subdued; this is not a brash man.

Roy waves him away, simultaneous dismissal and thanks. 'Your puns are terrible.'

'You bastard, Mustang,' Edward tells him as he leaves.

The joke occurs to him several minutes later, and he laughs, grip loose on his cup and balance precarious, laughs too loud and too long. It's been a while since he could.

VII.

Another joke: the fact that two months later, Edward is asleep in a chair in the anteroom of his office, breathing slowly through his nose and his hair slopping out of its braid over his shoulder. He always delivers his reports in person when he can, beholden to some sense of duty that seems to propel him into taking early trains and flagging down unimpressed soldiers to alert Central to his impending whirlwind presence.

Hawkeye nods at him from beside the door, benevolent and steely. Roy takes the message and slips to his side to pluck his mission write-up from his lap, disconcerted when it whispers out of his bare automail hand, fingers cold and lax against the tip of the thumb he hastily presses to paper to stop the pile from tumbling to the floor and waking up.

An hour later he grants permission for Hawkeye to move him to a emergency pallet in the breakroom alongside.

Edward stumbles into his office five hours after that, interrupting an important meeting with his equally important deputies, carrying a fistful of biscuits and a cup of tea, bleary-eyed and still mussed beyond any stretch of propriety. 'I told you to eat more, Mustang.' He eyes his deputies while Roy tries not to facepalm. 'Huh.'

They look back at him with expressions of profound apathy, but they radiate embarrassment on his behalf. 'We can resume this at a later date, sir.'

Roy waves them away. 'Give me an hour, generals.'

To his amazement they do nothing but nod and file out, near-identical in their dark-haired grimness.

Edward's smile is innocuous and shit-eating. 'She said you had a meeting, but I didn't believe it. You're always alone when I turn up. I was starting to worry.'

'You report only to me,' Roy counters, and this one of those days where it feels like an imposition. Delegation is the name of the game, but there are some things, some people. that should be handled alone. 'Should I have Breda and the rest here as well?'

'Would they ever let me leave?'

He doesn't bother to point out the obvious: that yes, they would. Hawkeye is one of the few who is willing to recognise this Edward as himself, and the others like him well enough, but they are not fond of him. Edward's genius is no longer endearing. 'Havoc might want dating tips.'

Edward grimaces, crumbs dusting the corners of his mouth. 'How about ""listen to your partner, tell them off when their breath stinks, and don't lead them on when you get sick of them and start working longer hours at the laboratory to avoid them""?' 

Roy's eyebrows are stretched so high they hurt. 'Personal experience?' 

'Yeah.' He chuckles, self-deprecating. 'It was -- over there,' a flap of his hand over his shoulder to the door, palm up: yesterday, at the back, forget it. 'It didn't go so well.'

Roy is surprised to find he has absolutely no desire to know, no curiosity, no joking impulse. He has never tried; from the looks of it, Edward had tried, and wears the failure as he wears his failed experiments, once close and now far, and he can see them in his mind already, bossy with shy hands and a pretty mind given the sharpness of being yanked from indulgent daydreaming, unforgiving of lapses in expectation, in schedule and devotion. To say they made him this is disingenuous. To say they aided the creation of the man who stands before him licking crumbs from his palm and noisily draining his military-issue tea is closer to the truth.

Edward's voice draws him out of his thoughts. 'My report's satisfactory, right?'

Roy forgets to scramble for a polite variation on ""exceedingly dull as ever, thank you"". 'You forgot to include at least one fart joke. I'm disappointed in you, Fullmetal.'

He licks the rim of his teacup. 'I'm afraid I was distracted by the ravenous mob all out for my hair.'

Roy can't quite decide if he's serious. Stranger things have happened to the Elric brothers. 'What did they want with your hair?'

'They wanted to know about the fine and secret art of braiding, sir.' Edward's composure rivals that of King Bradley's secretary.

He can't quite muffle his snort. 'I'm sure you would never divulge state secrets,' folding his hands and leaning forward earnestly. 'How did you handle the situation?'

'I taught the elders to make pigtails instead,' bland and deadpan for the few moments before he begins to laugh, clutching his sides, head forced back by the expanse of his laughter. 'Your face!'

Roy finds himself unable to resist a chuckle or two. 'I don't want to know what you used to transmute ribbons.'

Edward's expression brightens with guile. 'I didn't, sir. One of the elders had a spare pair of --'

His mind presents him with horrible, horrible imagery. 'I don't want to know,' he repeats.

'It could be vital to the state of the nation,' Edward continues. 'Imagine if the Philosopher's Stone could be recreated through the use of --'

'I don't want to know,' Roy says, wincing away from his inappropriate glee. 'Keep it to yourself, Fullmetal.'

Edward salutes him like the cheeky little brat he used to be, grinning outright. 'As you wish, sir.'

Roy shakes his head, amused and a little nostalgic, watching his brightness fade into the everyday clarity he wears with the simple honesty he thinks Alphonse had when they were brothers who died for each other. He thinks, but he can't be certain; if only Alphonse had a human face at the time. Then he would have been able to tell. 'Your next assignment. Dismissed,' he says as gently as he can while drowning in pieces of detritus and piles of flotsam, and Edward Elric has never been either.

He startles out of his Alphonse-shaped thoughts and sets his cup on the edge of his desk, dusting crumbs off onto his jacket and taking the clipped pages he holds out to him. 'Oh, right. Yeah,' skimming the first page, 'this looks okay. See you Friday after next, Mustang.'

Both brothers address him so casually these days, his name become uninflected title, and it seems wrong to keep thinking of them when he has work to do, the stately business of budgets and moral accountancy and diplomacy and grudges poured into sons bartered to the military for a chance at death. He thinks of those six years without them instead.

VIII.

'Unforseen circumstances.' Edward explains his four-month absence with quick, wry words, arms folded. He's tall enough to tilt his chin down to meet his eyes, tall of spine and taller eyes, and Roy lets it go with a wave of his free hand, signing papers with the other.

Legislation without counsel irritates him. 'What circumstances would those be, Fullmetal?' 

Four months of incomplete reports every fortnight and once a phone call to his home at six o'clock to remind him to eat breakfast was far too much like those years when he wasn't here at all, duplicated by his brother who was passable at a distance and eerily mistaken in the smaller things with no-one to tell him to stop, and he had worried, had remembered the fitful conversations he had with Hawkeye: <em>I should search for Edward.</em> Her response was rote by the second month: <em>Where?</em>

Where, indeed, and this time he'd known his precise location, confirmed every two weeks, and it hadn't helped at all.

'Internal conflict gone bad,' Edward dismisses. 'Same old same old to anybody who lived there, apparently, but it was the first I'd heard of it.' He makes an indignant face at his own lack of knowledge. 'I think it's settled now, but I'd like to go out there about a year from now to make sure.'

Roy is too relieved to see him whole and here again to be charmed. 'Are you sure you didn't create another Lior?'

Edward hardens like the transmutation of his hand into a blade, the sweep of his palm in working alchemy upon himself. 'That's low even for you, Mustang.'

He presses his fingertips to his eyes. 'I apologise,' stiff and formal and sorry. 'From my other reports, you did well.'

'I'm the Fullmetal Alchemist,' Edward says, and though he is not forgiven, he will let it pass, internal chemistry of memory undisturbed. The sound of him is bitter nonetheless. 'I learn from my mistakes when I know about them. Especially when they cause massacres. Those are the important ones, sir.'

Roy winces, stung. He knows what it is to be brought to unfair account. 'Leave it, Ed.'

He relaxes, arms unfolding and his hands coming to rest by his sides, open and identical through his white gloves. 'That's the first time you've called me that since I came back,' he observes. 'Guess that means I can ask you to have dinner with me. All connotations meant.'

'What?' He blinks. If anything, he expected the offer to come earlier, but apparently no Elric is subject to conventional timing. 'Fullmetal --'

'Edward,' he corrects. 'I know you'll turn me down, but it's there, just so you know. And don't think I forgot,' he warns. 'That was some seriously uncool shit-flinging, Mustang. You of all people, and with the Ishbal thing to boot --'

'I apologised!'

'You still said it.' He's implacable, grim-mouthed. 'You said it, and it was absolutely out of line, and we are not having dinner tonight.'

Roy smirks, uncomfortable with this kind of talk coming from Edward Elric and at ease with familiar territory. 'I wasn't going to accept.'

'I know,' he says, utterly unruffled. 'I'm making a point. Let me know if it worked. Goodnight.'

He stares at his back, tapping his pen, and calls him before he can open the door. 'Edward.'

'Yes?' Guarded and careful and clear.

He can't find anything to say. Should he apologise again? Should he try to explain how he'd thought to protect them both, how they had been children and he'd known what it felt like to be part of that, had imagined all too easily how it would feel to know he were the catalyst? Should he take him up on that invitation, though he has no time and no effort and no mind to spare for what will ultimately be a disappointing evening cut short?

In the end, he settles for something safely inane, and in the end, Edward beats him to it. 'Don't talk about my dead and I won't say anything about yours. Equivalent trade.'

'That's a myth,' he finds the voice to say.

Edward gives him a half-smile over his shoulder. 'But it's a nice story.'

IX.

'Let me tell you a story that isn't nice,' he announces, six months of dull and reassuringly boring twice-monthly reports later, palms flat on his desk, an intensity to his carriage Roy knows to be wary of. 'Let me tell you something. Back when guns jammed every six bullets, there was alchemy, and there was a Gate. There weren't many people who reached it.'

Roy shifts uneasily. 'Edward, this is not the time --'

He cuts him off with a sharp wave of his automail hand. 'Listen. Not many got there, but some did, and they reported creatures there, strange little children with sharp teeth and grasping sticky hands that, that unwound forever, and beautiful eyes.'

He shudders.

'And in this time of bullets that didn't go anywhere, there was another side of the gate. The gate had another door, another way out, or in.' He listens, horrified. Impossible. Absolutely impossible. 'And someone went through it. Went out. And there he was told that alchemy came at the cost of the lives on the other side of the gate.'

Blood drains from his face, aching and lightheaded. 'Edward --'

'There,' his voice only now shaking, 'there, he found it to be true.' He slaps his palm down onto the pile of his reports over the last year, reviewed for the annual performance evaluation he forces the entire military to undertake in an effort to share in his tedium. 'That's why I don't use alchemy anymore. Now, <em>stop asking</em>.'

Edward leaves, trailing his father's scent, and Roy sits in stunned silence and has absolutely no idea what to do.

'He could be wrong, sir,' Hawkeye says.

They both know that on occasion, the Fullmetal Alchemist makes mistakes. They both know that Edward Elric's mistakes are different again, and this speech, this monologue, is the result of neither.

Roy studies his gloves for a long minute, the air in his office still fraught with Edward's pain.

X.

The first time they touch, it's the press of Ed's hand to his jaw, his thumb crossing to his cheek, the apex of his hand against his chin. His automail hand, the hand that could crush his face, tear his jawbone away and dig in to rip out his throat as casually as Roy picks fishbones out of his teeth, his hand that does nothing but hold him still.

Edward's regard is challenging in its collectedness. 'Do you mind?'

'No,' and swallows against the feel of jointed metal, meets his eyes without moving his head. 'Do you?'

'I don't know,' Edward says, matter-of-fact truth, and his automail stirs as he drops to touch his collarbone, and he can feel it function against him, can feel parts and solidity and weight, and he shivers, anticipation roiling through his legs where it can't be seen.

Roy looks away. 'I still use alchemy.'

'I know <em>that</em>,' he says, withering censure and irritated forbearance. 'Not like you keep it a secret. But you should know what your mistakes are. It doesn't matter if you repeat them.'

'Is this a mistake?' He knows it most probably is.

'Yeah, maybe,' Edward admits, and pulls back, settling into the chair opposite him. Breakfast on a Sunday morning is much like breakfast on any other day he has the pleasure of his company: being woken up, grumbled at, insulted, and then eating food made from scratch -- invariably much better as a result -- with Edward Elric keeping him lazy company by poring over the newspaper and reading aloud the funny inch-squeeze articles. 

Roy breathes into the damp gap of his palms stretched over his face, steepled over his nose, eyelashes brushing his fingers, and his voice is muffled. 'I'm not sure I have the time or inclination to take you up on this.'

Edward sounds amused and more like himself than he has in years. The more time they spend together, the more he sounds like his old self, as though Roy makes him remember snatches of dialogue and whispers of body language to put on his body until they wear true, and he doesn't know if he welcomes or resents it, if it's something he should like. He's become used to his standoffishness, his slippery unaffected sympathy. 'I figured. Whenever, or never, it's okay.'

'You're alright with my political concerns?' Roy supposes Edward had to learn patience somehow, sometime, somewhere, but the main didn't happen where he could see it, and that seems like the greatest loss of all at the moment.

'Since when have you been anything but?' He pushes a cup of coffee across the table, scraping loudly and visible through the gaps between his fingers. 'You look fucking awful. Drink up.'

'You look worse,' he counters, straightening and cradling his cup in his hands. 'Alphonse?'

Edward shrugs, his wry smile half-hearted. 'Who else? I promised him, you know. That we'd always be together, that whatever we did, it'd be together. We'd both get our bodies back. But I don't know what he blames me for more, that I broke the promise and he got a body because I gave up mine, or that I left.'

It's too early for Roy to step as carefully as he'd like to, given that Edward's account is no less conflicting and confusing than any other, if thankfully abbreviated. 'Is that what happened? Your friend Roze was not --' He hesitates over a word to describe her dull fear, her quirked smile as she told him Edward was gone, 'very forthcoming.'

'It was more complicated than that. But yeah, basically. I mean, he did it first, he used himself and got me my arm and leg back, but it wasn't -- I didn't do it to spite him. It wasn't trade. It was the right thing to do.'

He rubs his eyes, mind skipping over marginalia: the unrecognisable twisted weft of his shirtsleeves, the concentations of coffee and cream and the merits of syrup versus it simply being saturated, Edward's hair glossing grey at the temples in summer sunlight, alchemy and transubstantiation in the mediated mutation of intangible elements, soul and memory and sacrifice. 'Are such matters of concern to the Gate?'

'Yes and no,' Edward answers, maddening in his imprecision, and he rolls his eyes at Roy's irritated wave and explains himself. 'The Gate creatures don't care. They take the payment they're hungry for. But the Gate itself, maybe.' 

Edward sketches rough diagrams in the air between them, towering double-doors framed by columns and the darkness within bound shut even as they slowly opened, describes ambient lighting and calmly indifferent sapience, countermatched by hands that writhed as they stretched forth, how Envy had gone in with angry fearlessness and paid for it, how he himself had been, and he doesn't explain further, speaks of other things. For his part Roy thinks further afield, of Riesenbool and his own father, of the man known as Scar and how his demeanour so reminded him of things he had long forgotten, of his mother and her well-honed acceptably-tamed fierceness. He thinks of the Elric brothers, how they had been, how one half waits opposite him, content in his broken-cupped openness.

'It cares about blood and it minds souls trying to cross, and sometimes those things mean something when they're applied right,' he says plainly. 'I was a murderer already, with my alchemy and the stupid stunts I pulled, and I paid the Gate with things that weren't mine, and when I did finally pay, it was, I got back the interest. It was enough to let Alphonse have his body back. All of the lives in,' Edward stumbles, 'the Philosopher's Stone, in the homonculi, were enough to let me see our father.'

He goes quite, quite still, steam curling warm in his nose. 'Alphonse was the Philosopher's Stone.'

'Yeah. It's a long story. Maybe I'll write a book someday when I'm middle-aged and crotchety and obsessed with philosophy and Alphonse forgives me,' that last as unlikely as the rest, and Roy eats his breakfast. Edward Elric is not a man who will live into the true adulthood of softening flesh and crows feet and inconvenient doctor's visits; he is young, improbably beautiful, and he will remain so until his all-too-expected early death.

He has half a mind to let himself be touched. He also has half a mind to deliver a stinging lecture filled to the brim with infamous Mustang wit on whatever happened to the Fullmetal Alchemist's audacity, but he knows now and it has become yet another joke punctured of its humour.

Edward sniffs dismissively and wipes his nose on the back of his flesh hand. 'But seriously, let me know when.'

Roy allows a smirk. 'Not if?'

His grin is bright and genuine, the hand he places atop his conspiratorial and comforting in its quick solidity even with the bubbles of snot smeared across his knuckles. 'I know you want me.'

XI.

This time he wakes to a State Alchemist flopped across his legs, head pillowed on the bed angled away from his shoulder and his shins uncomfortable against his knees. He's asleep, by the looks of things, and Roy scrubs a hand over his face and prods him away, concerned when he rolls with an easy acquiescence that belies how stubborn he is when conscious enough to put together an argument that might just be entirely bullshit. It usually is at least thirty percent bullshit. 'Edward?'

'Fuck off.'

'That's no way to speak to your superior.' Roy rolls his eyes and kicks him, pushing harder and harder each time until he yelps and clutches at the bedsheets to stop himself from rolling off the edge. 'Really, Fullmetal.'

'Shut up,' Edward mumbles, already asleep by the looks of things. 'Smug bastard.'

Life is just fine as long as he can get a rise out of Edward, Roy surmises, and feels better already, more awake in the rumpled sheets, the seam of his pillowcase now diagonal under Fullmetal's cheek, the grinding grey of once-crisp shirts gone flat and dull in humidity visible through his open cupboard doors, yesterday's suspenders slung over the back of a chair. More awake in his life of small things and large things writ as though they are small, lines on typewritten reports, Hawkeye's uncommon skill in guarding his door, the bright flush of Edward's hair in his bed, his gleaming foot.

This day he rouses himself and pieces together breakfast, toast burnt at one corner and butter melted too soon, coffee he doesn't burn, and sits at his table, two plates laid, and rests his eyelids during bites, breathing to the mechanical assurance of Edward's presence, soft clicks and burring movement as he sleeps. He has a little time.

Edward wakes as Roy considers making a fresh pot, haggard in rest. 'Urk.' He sniffs, tongue hanging out as he licks his teeth and gags at the taste. 'Cream?'

Roy dutifully pours some into the second, untouched mug. 'You should sleep in your own bed.'

'Bite me. You're the one who keeps making Hawkeye and everyone else worried enough to order six-am wake-up calls.' He nods at Roy's plate, pushes it against his forearm to make his point. 'Havoc says you're not eating enough to do your job.'

'Havoc owes me sixty dollars,' Roy says, dutifully buttering his third slice of toast. 'If he thinks I'll forget because of a decent meal, he's mistaken.'

Edward puts his chin on his palm and stares him down, methodically sipping his coffee and eyes so unblinking that Roy's start to water in sympathy. Finally, he says: 'Is this the part where I interpret that as an offer to take you out to dinner?'

He swallows abruptly and coughs for a minute, grasping the table in something he recognises as possibly being anxiety. It's intriguing, and he wasn't sure that he actually cared this much, but it seems becoming aware of the possibility helped it to matter. Helped a lot of things to matter, and he clears his throat. 'I think so, yes.'

'Alright,' a concise nod, and he straightens, palms flat on the table, and Roy finds himself charmed by how seriously Edward is taking this, has been taking all of it. Such reasoned discipline. 'Would you like to have dinner with me sometime so you can get fed and Havoc can stop acting squirrely?'

Roy nods. 'I would indeed, F--' He gets a warning look for the trouble, and revises. 'Ed.'

He prods the back of his hand. 'You can call me Edward if that's too informal.'

'Edward,' and by now he's not sure if he's agreeing or just mocking him a little, and he takes in the impressive indignant wrinkle in his nose and thinks over his schedule, the missions slated for his most infamous alchemist. The situation at large has been far better in the last four years, and better again these six months, and he is under no illusions about who is responsible for that particular blessing. 'Edward,' he says again, the matter settled. 'I have two hours free from six o'clock on Thursday.'

'Great,' Edward says, and by all appearances he means it, his smile the complicated satisfaction of adults. 'I've been meaning to check out the Central Library, anyway. Research!' He rubs his hands together in anticipation.

'Are you going to educate yourself on proper etiquette?'

He scowls. 'Are you saying I don't know my manners?'

Roy can't quite resist smiling at him, for him. 'Your comportment is severely lacking, Fullmetal.'

'You wish,' he bites back, and yes, he wishes. He wishes for Edward Elric to be someone who would, could, scream and shout at him; he wishes there were a single part of Edward's instinctive adjustment to public-private-public that he could find flaw with; he wishes Edward weren't a diplomat of an alchemist; he wishes the Elric brothers could have the delight of random, pointless, explosive transmutation again, no matter how wasteful he thought it to be at the time.

A finger flicks against his forehead and he blinks, controlled flinch in the jerking twitch of his eyes under the skin, and he refuses the urge to scratch it away. It irritates him. 'What was that?'

'You're brooding,' Edward explains, reseating himself. 'I'm beginning to think you need more than a few nights out of that stuffy office of yours.'

'A year of dinners,' he agrees. 'Dinners and women and enough cigarettes to drown my lungs. I delegate everything and you handle far more than I should in regulations, and I knew it'd be difficult.'

He nods. 'The daily shit sucks. Are you picking the place, or am I?'

'I'll choose,' he says immediately. 'I don't want to think about what you consider a good restaurant.'

'The Fuhrer needs to be seen with the Fullmetal Alchemist,' Edward says with matter-of-fact incisiveness, and sometimes Roy wonders what happened to make him this way, so aware of his visibility in a way his younger self never was, so able to decipher his code without spluttering at it or taking offense that he uses it at all.

Edward's familiarity with institutionalised and occasionally lethal politics makes sense if he were involved with some form of structured, competitive research in the other world without the benefits of alchemic talent, and as such, he doesn't bother to acknowledge the insight, examines him instead. 'You look like something the cat dragged in.'

He laughs to himself, low and quiet. 'Yeah, I was out. Got kind of sloshed, met a guy and hit it off and now I've had about two hours sleep.' His grin is brilliantly satisfied. 'So worth it.'

'I see.' It stings a little to hear it spoken of so easily, but there is no more loyalty that he can ask from Edward, and this is not Fullmetal's infidelity. In this he remains tactless as ever, which comes as no surprise, and a brief comfort in the knowledge that he will never be a man Edward speaks of so easily.

'I can stop when and if you have the right to,' he says.

'No, I understand.' He pushes away his plate, doesn't want to stand up just yet, would like to keep their eyes level, their respective status vaguely equalised by his being one of the unlikeliest Fuhrers in history and Edward being Edward Elric and both of them off-duty in the complicated way of career military.

Edward rises, hands flat, and leans forward slowly, intense and serious and telegraphing like hell, and Roy sits and lets him, controls the tiredness and the reflexive thought of <em>how does this contribute to becoming Fuhrer?</em> He often has to remind himself that he is indeed where he wanted to be, where he dreamed of being, that he holds the power now.

And right now this is where he wants to be, holding the power to accept with the touch of Edward's mouth to his forehead, a seal of the unspoken promise to try and stop worrying Hawkeye, to move forward, to be more efficient in his leadership, to be what they are to each other with attendant interruptions. Then he brushes against his lips, a soft warming like change in the distance, a whirling seagull, an alchemist using no muffled-inherited alchemy at all in speaking of these things.

Part of adulthood is honesty, and he allows himself to be honest, allows himself to lean in, just a little, and draw back, a kinaesthetic metaphor for everything.

Edward's smile is warm and true and reminds him of Hughes. 'There, was that so hard?'

XII.

Alphonse conceeds the issue, staring flatly at cobblestones and rubbing the side of his hand over a developing zit on his cheek, a chance meeting between open hallways and unguarded coffers.

'You don't trust me with your brother?' he says, mild as Hohenheim's coffee. If Edward didn't tell him outright that he'd encountered his father in the other world, that small habit would have.

His smile is glossy, filled with lurking sincerity and too many years alone to despair and guilt and resent. 'You always liked him better.'

'Alphonse,' reprimand, because as much as Edward is willing to love him, is willing to risk the attempt of loving with hindsight, Al has always been his first thought, and his accusation bears truth only in its direction. 'This is up to you.'

'I don't know what you think you're doing, Mustang,' he says, a final show of outwardly-cheerful put-on respect. 'Just don't fuck it up.'

Both Elrics remain fair men by habit and conscious inclination, and he can take grudging patience when it comes in place of bitterness, his thanks sincere in full.

XIII.

'I'm not that old,' Roy complains, and he's trying to maintain his dignity and refrain from scorching Edward's feet in revenge for playing silly buggers for the last half hour, but with Ed waving his latest report in his face and grinning mischievously like he knows Roy will never, ever discipline him is enough to make him wish for Hawkeye's ability to cold-clock people so they go down and stay there.

'You're old,' Edward pronounces like it's an obvious conclusion. 'You're going grey.'

'I'm too old for your antics,' he says wearily. 'That doesn't mean I'm old. It means you're acting like a toddler.'

'I'm not short!' Edward flares.

Roy pinches his eyebrows together. This is more interesting than reviewing the next morning's agenda, but the agenda has the added bonus of being inanimate and unlikely to tap his nose of its own accord. 'Then don't call me old.'

He kisses him and Roy trips him with his foot, not inclined to make this easy. 'Oi,' he protests.

'Behave. I need to verify this.' He doesn't say: There will be a secretary along in five minutes asking why I haven't signed anything in an hour and she'll tell Hawkeye and I have a reputation to maintain.

Edward picks himself up from the floor, playfulness subsiding as he sinks into a chair opposite him with a book stolen from the pile Roy now keeps on the corner of his desk, left behind on previous visits and never reclaimed. 'I'll wait.'

He waits as Roy had waited during those years, preoccupied elsewhere for brief periods but the act of remaining and waiting an omnipresent choice of constants and risks and declaratives from moment to moment, performing inaction: I waited. I do wait. I will wait.

'Come back with me for dinner,' he says an hour of rasping pages and quietly rearranged limbs and intense blurring focus later. They won't -- they won't anything. But it means something, this first of their both being in his standard-issue officer's flat at night, and though he means it straight the implications, the alternatives, hang like diffuse participles; <em>maybe</em>.

'You'll make me cook,' Edward says, distracted and still reading, making a note on the page with a pen no doubt stolen off his desk too.

Roy taps a pile of requisitions into alignment, side and top and side again, and he thanks his gloves for saving him from papercuts. 'Do you mind?'

'You're doing the dishes,' immediate and certain and a little fond of Roy and a difficult universe both, and he fails to quite care that his dish soap gives him hangnails.

'Will you stay after dinner?' He keeps signing things, crossing out paragraphs and striking out the odd absurdity working its way up the command chain, in hopes of being able to distract himself from an answer he finds he cares about.

Edward Elric is watching him when he risks looking up, book steady in finely-controlled hands, the son of Trisha Elric and Hohenheim, brother to Alphonse and filled with six years elsewhere, Fullmetal Alchemist and ultimately Edward Elric, a man brimful of gates and circles and, in the end, doors which may or may not be opened, which may or may not respond to a particular chosen touch. 'Yes.'

He is no longer a man to flinch from being loved. 'Good.'

"event","Rambling notes: Wrote this one a month or so ago after <lj user=kishmet> and I were talking about Rikkaidai and their weirdness and probable causes for said weirdness, and I was like, 'they must've had a coach. Surely they must've seen it. Surely they must've noticed <em>something</em>', and this fic is the result. Features all of Rikkaidai, with a shot of Yukimura laced through. Outside POV, from the coach's perspective. Gen piece. Enjoy?


<lj-cut text=""Medical doctors don't see everything.""><strong>Ten Steps To Secession:</strong>

<strong>1.</strong> 

Rikkai Dai Fukozu is a school known for the brilliance of its students. 

All those who apply to the tennis team have already been through several rigorous mental and physical checks, including certificates from two doctors and several of the school's on-call staff. However, there is a tradition among the coaches of noting the personalities of their charges, the makeups of their teams. The problem children. Medical doctors don't see everything. 

At the bottom of one sheet, there is this: <em>Watch out</em>. The name on the application is Yukimura Seiichi. 

<strong>2.</strong>  

The first concern is voiced by Yukimura Seiichi himself. 

'Coach?' He is a tiny little thing, legs and arms and a wide smile, a fuzzy headband. He always wonders if he were that small himself at that age. 

'Yes, Yukimura?'

'You may need to remove me from the team.' He bites his lip, this little sprite, this elfling, and he remembers <em>Watch out</em>, the repetition from every one of Yukimura's teachers, his coaches, the doctors: <em>Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.</em>

'Why would I need to do that?' 

'I think I might be causing problems. I don't know. Am I causing problems?' 

He thinks carefully: the children dropping out, how young Sanada and Yanagi have flanked Yukimura, how driven they all are. A good example, perhaps. A warning, also. A lesson. 'No, you are not. I will inform you if you are.'

'Oh, good. If I do, remove me immediately, please? I wouldn't want to hurt anyone.' And he gives him that child's smile, spirit-brightness with mind-brightness behind it, and he blinks to find Yukimura has left and there are forms on his desk that were not there previously. 

<em>Please note this child is at risk of asthmatic and allergic reactions. The causes have not been indentified, but the symptoms include: irritability, short attention span, unusual fixitation, temper outbursts. If reactions occur, please telephone me.</em> The signature is of Yukimura's doctor. He sets it aside.

<strong>3.</strong> 

'You understand this is a very competitive school. A very competitive sport. There may not be much I can do.' 

Yukimura's doctor sounds frustrated. He has come to know the man a little from his weekly calls. 'There must be something. You could suspend him, or instigate compulsory breaks--' 

'We have those,' he repeats. 'As I said. It is competitive, and the students do not have much time to spare. He thinks he can do this. I agree.'

'Well, I suppose. I don't know. How is he?' 

'He is fine. A little pale, some days. You mentioned shortness of breath.' The symptom list has grown and grown, a mass of his handwriting, a few select teachers adding to it in their hasty scribbles of <em>lapses in out of daydreaming, refuses schoolwork, sometimes does not answer questions. Reacts violently when called upon.</em> All of this, taken alone, is no cause for concern. Rikkai Dai Fukozu did not come to be what it is by coddling its students. 'He is fine.'
 
Tests may show nothing, but he knows this school and its students well, and Rikkai Dai takes care of its own. 

<strong>4.</strong> 

'I am your coach,' he repeats with unfeigned patience. 'How is my asking after Yukimura's health meddling?' 

Sanada glares at him. Such a bright child, once the hope of the kendo team, gifted in calligraphy and traditional methods of art, but still a child. 'He's sick. It's in his file.' 

'I know how he is, Sanada. I am asking what he is like. It is important that the team have good leadership.' 

He brightens. 'You mean-' 

'Yes, I do. But I must know Yukimura's disposition first.' It is a telling sign of Sanada's education that this does not faze him. 

'He's fine.' His mouth turns down. 'Bitchy. That's not going in the files, is it?' 

'No.' Of course it will. It is the duty of Rikkai Dai to ensure the best of their students' health, including their concerns, their terminology. It will be filed that Sanada describes a friend as <em>bitchy</em>, and it will be forgotten. 'Is there anything else?' 

'No.' He hesitates, shakes his head. 'No. Nothing.'

<strong>5.</strong> 

'Yukimura doesn't have optimal neurochemical balance. I don't need to tell you this. It's obvious.' Once, he would have smiled. These days hearing Yanagi's erudition, his quick flawless pronounciation, weights his spirits. 

'His doctor says it cannot be diagnosed.' He spreads his hands, palm up. 'They don't know.' 

Yanagi is unimpressed. 'They never do,' he snaps. 

'Speaking from experience?' 

He does not glare, but if he were Sanada, he would. Yanagi, so talented, with a gift for the immediate and no understanding of eventualities. He has seen many of these children. 'I apologise; that was rude of me.' 

'Yes, it was. You can't do anything. We need Yukimura as our captain. He's the only one that can do it.' 

He leans back in his chair and balances a pen on his finger, nib upwards. Lifts an eyebrow. 'Because of his neurochemical balance?' 

'He's our friend,' and that is all. 

<strong>6.</strong> 

Yukimura Seiichi's homeroom teacher appears composed at first sight, but there are knots in the ends of her hip-length hair, and a wildness to her movements, and she startles when he takes the folders out of her hands, puts them on the desk, and wraps his fingers around her wrists. He sets the rhythm; she nods, closes her eyes and breathes. Every staff member knows to do this for each other, knows the ritual, the pace and scope of it, and when she opens her eyes again they are clear. 'Thank you.'

'Yukimura,' and her lips purse, her usual practicality asserting itself. He likes to watch her, the way she deals with the students, the other staff who balance and check themselves; her experience, lacking instability, is welcome. 

'Early symptoms. Duration of onset ... hmm, five years? I predict hallucinations at fifteen, first psychotic episode at nineteen.' 

'Care to bet on that?' 

She smiles, shakes her head as always. This is the benefit of an escalator school: they can note these things, file them away for those to look back and say: <em>ah, here. This is where it began.</em> 

'He's obsessed,' she says. 

'They all are.'

'Not quite like this.' She picks up the first folder, slides it his way. 'Today's notes. He's worsening. I think there's some sort of physical complication, chronic, perhaps stress-related.' 

He accepts, studies her. 'You should see Yanigasawa.' The pyschologist reserved for the staff on this floor. A good man. 

She exhales, smooths the fabric of her coat. 'Yes. I will.'

<strong>7.</strong> 

The day of Yukimura Seiichi's first hospitalisation, carefully worded <em>collapsed, required immediate medical attention</em>, grace notes of <em>exhibited signs of psychological distress</em>, shorthard cryptology, Kuwahara Jackal tells him, 'This school isn't what I thought it was.' He's fidgeting. 

Scholarship student, welcomed as any other, his skin a marker as apparent as the hallucinatory side-effect of some psychopharmacology medications and as unremarked. He likes this child. Steadiness with the patina of pathology, but nothing disruptive. 

'What did you think it was?' He is frankly curious; parents transfer their children into Rikkai Dai's escalator system at the first serious inkling that something is <em>different strange wrong</em> with their children, usually at three to four years of age; Kuwahara is of a comparatively docile temperament. 

'A school. Not a hospital.' 

'All children must be taught,' Rikkai Dai Fukozu's ethics in a few simple words. 'However they appear. Do you wish to transfer?' An honest question, truly; some students did transfer when the choice was given them. They often found themselves dead as one of the many unhappy consequences.

'No. I have friends here. But -- is it wise to have doubles teams?' 
 
'It is important to win,' he says, and these are words he believes. 'Our students may be unusual, but that makes their achievements far more necessary. It is difficult otherwise. Some compromises must be made. Do you think you cannot compensate for your partner?' 

'Niou and Yagyuu,' half-words brimful with meaning. He sighs. 

'They are a special case. Their methods do not have to be yours. You may ask your psychologist if you are having trouble. She will happily offer solutions to solve your problems, and I am sure Bunta will assist. He does not intend to cause you grief.'

'<em>I'm</em> not so sure,' a brief show of spirit. Worry is already tracked into the set of his lips; no reassurance will be enough, and yet he chooses to persist. This is the worth of a Rikkai Dai student, as it should be.

<strong>8.</strong> 

Yukimura cannot sit still in a chair with moving parts. If it is all bolted together, as so many of the school chairs are, he will be still. In his office chair, however, Yukimura crosses his feet at the ankle and twists from side to side while bobbing his head and tapping the desk, all of it to a tune with a three-quarter rhythm and no concordance. 

'I'm fine,' the child insists. 'For a coach, you give out a lot of touchy-feely emotional support. I thought that wasn't part of the assigned Rikkai Dai Fukozu role?' The question hangs for a moment and Yukimura distracts himself with methodically dogearing every page corner within reach.

He's too tired for this, and he shifts, tries to work at the knot lodged next to his spine under his right shoulderblade. It refuses to move. So does Yukimura.

In the end he grabs the back of the chair and tips the child out of it, and with his quick, unsteady reflexes he keeps his balance, but it's a near thing, and Yukimura immediately sits back down on a pile of glossy promotional coaching textbooks with titles like <em>How To Make A Super Star In Thirty Days</em>. He could write one. It would be titled <em>Exercise & Your Mentally Ill Child</em>. No-one would buy it. 

The child wobbles, slips, and lands on the second pile of government announcements proclaiming the importance of health education in schools.

He takes his rightful place and debates whether to cross his ankles, then does it anyway. 'Fine, are you?' 

'That was on purpose. It's the championship,' the child says. 'You shouldn't break the track record. Deprive the school of another shiny trophy. You don't really want to take me off the team, anyway. You need me to keep them in line.'

'What I saw today was you keeping them in line?' 

'It worked, didn't it?' 

'Cruelty can be performed with the best of intentions. We seem to have differing ideas of 'in line', Yukimura.' He leans forward. 'You see 'keeping them in line' as being the same as 'holding them under your strict command'. And you are strict, for Rikkai Dai.' Yukimura steeples his fingers when he does, deliberately gives him a serious, thoughtful expression that is most likely the mirror match of his. He would like to remind the child that he is not too old to spank, but this is not the time. 'Especially for Rikkai Dai. We have found your example of authority counterproductive in past. The question I'm asking you is whether continuing to harm your teammates' health, and your own, will be worth it in the long run.' 

'Of course it is. We must win the championship by any means necessary.' The child sounds fiercely determined, greedy and bloodthirsty and certain, and this, here, is why Yanagi, normally so wary of others, latched onto this child like a pufferfish. In this, they are alike. 

'Is that so?' 

Yukimura softens. 'I'm sorry, I realise this must be disturbing for you. You're always emphasising how important sportmanship is. But don't you see?' He shifted, ignoring his precarious position, and gave him another one of those blazing bright expressions, alight with conviction, the need to persuade. Belief. 'It's the championship. It's all of us. We work for this every day. Extra practices, the drills -- it's to make us proud. To make the school proud of us. To make you proud, Coach.' 

That right there is why Sanada, normally so wary of the ones who run unpredictable like pack ice, thick and difficult and layered in impenentrable waters, has adopted this child as his leader. Unfortunately, he himself is by dint of long exposure immune to manipulation and far too open to his own curiosity.

'I'll be watching you,' he warns. 

'It's a promise. Do you need me to help with this?' Yukimura says, smiling with satisfaction, perfectly willing to be courteous now that he has what he wants.

'No. You are dismissed.' The child in fact bounces out of his office, and he hears a flurry of conversation, the spikes of Yanagi's growing-out haircut, the broad brim of a cap, and closes the door behind them.

He reaches for Yukimura's folder, records the conversation, his conclusions. In future they will say: <em>here, the turning point</em>. Here and now it is merely interesting.

<strong>9.</strong> 

'Not really, no.' Niou, bland and cordial in person for all that his appearance is forceful. 'It's not a problem. We can handle him, most days.' 

'I think Sanada shouldn't be vice-captain if he's going to be slinging around his backhand like that, but other than that, Kirihara won't change much of the dynamics.' Yagyuu, on the other hand, presents himself as the pressed-wallpaper embodiment of perfection, but here with the doors closed, with a coach who knows all there is to be known, he is relaxed in his vicious precision. 

'Sanada specifically?'  

'Sanada and Kirihara default to violence. Kirihara makes Sanada default a lot. Not tennis-default, but you know what I mean,' Niou says. 

'Kirihara needs to learn Rikkai Dai Fukozu rules. Unfortunately, he suffers that all-too-common condition of being unable to work within them.' He polishes his glasses, adjusts them on his nose. 'I'm sure you will have enough entertainment to fill another hand or two.' 

'Yagyuu,' a warning hiss.

'Did I say that? I meant ""folder"".' The child allows himself to break the flat, unlined planes of his face enough to smile. 'I apologise.' 

It's a rare enough concession that he accepts it. 'No matter. Now, Yukimura.' 

'I don't know why you keep giving him drugs that list muscle weakness as a side effect. He fell over six times yesterday. Laughed each time, of course, but kicking in at matchpoint was bad timing. I don't know if you saw that.' 

'I also saw that he was propositioning each of you.' 

'It's partly the drugs and partly he's an incurable flirt,' Yagyuu cut in. 'It was annoying, but that's it. Being told I'm rakishly handsome doesn't hurt.' 

Niou gives Yagyuu a sidelong speculative expression he's long ago learnt to interpret as a portent of disaster. Best to head it off. 'Niou?'

'It's Yukimura,' he shrugs. 'He just does stuff like that.' 

'He does,' Yagyuu agrees. 

<strong>10.</strong> 

He knows it's bad when the cake is left untouched. As one of Rikkai Dai Fukozu's openly kleptomaniac students is on the team, he's learnt long ago to gauge the mood by how much cake is left on the plate hidden in the cabinet after they use his office for one of their monthly team meetings. 

He calls Bunta, apparently interrupting him during a mandatory play session with his younger siblings. 'Yeah, no, I don't -- could, could you please, fuck, don't you fucking do that you little shithead --' 

'Language.' 

The child huffs. 'Yukimura's saying he doesn't need the meds just after you found a combo says works for him and you want me to be fucking polite? Like hell.' 

'What happened?' He's very careful not to sound worried. Bunta's breathing is uneven as it is, and there's some sort of conversation in the background, and an abrupt silencing of the whine of very young children, before he responds. 

'Yeah. No. He just says he can't play properly with them and he doesn't need them anyway so he's gonna go back to normal. Normal,' scornful resentment. 'Like fucking hell. My brothers are normal. Rikkai Dai isn't normal. Yukimura's not normal. I know what normal is even if I forget sometimes and he <em>isn't it</em>.' 

'Bunta. You and your team are at this school for a reason. You all try in different ways.' 

'Yeah. Yeah, I know, except that doesn't help right now. You know what would help? Making him take his fucking meds. He stresses me out, man. Yagyuu too and Jackal sometimes but Yukimura stresses me the fuck out. I am not kidding.' 

'I believe you. Breathe.' 

'Right. Right. Yeah. Breathing.' 

'We shall see,' he says, a deliberate beat slower than usual. 'We don't know what the situation will be and we don't know what he will be like. He was showing signs of progress before we began experimenting with medication. He may not be so stressful now.' 

'I fucking wish. Coach?' 

'Yes?' 

'You could've done something about it. Taken him off the team or something. Have you seen what Sanada's like now? He's off his game worrying. We all know you picked up something wrong ages ago. Why didn't you <em>do</em> something?' 

He could have done something. He knows this to be true. However: 'Action without reason is not the way of Rikkai Dai.' 

'Fuck you.' 

The dial tone clicks in his ear. Too much truth for a child, perhaps. He thinks, with a little surprise, that Yukimura would have understood precisely what he meant.

A pity that Bunta was not one of the few to truly live by Rikkai Dai Fukozu's principles, but he had his own loyalties, his own grudges, and but for a small push of truth, of things he was unwilling to accept in either surface lie or deeper meaning, he is now Yukimura's to control and his to observe.

Tomorrow, the secession. He's looking forward to it. 

<em>Coda.</em>

<strong>11.</strong> 

The morning of Nationals finals, an expression of illumination, the sweet curve of clever lips: 'I'm feeling much better today.'

<strong>Rating:</strong> R, possibly NC-17 for mild mentions of sexing.
<strong>Author's Notes:</strong> Simultaneously one of the strongest and weakest POVS I've ever written, and I have no idea how to present this as anything other than what it is, except that I don't know what it is either, so let's say it's an experiment in comma abuse and leave it at that. ""Matame Amor"" by Los de Abajo was the entire inspiration for this story. It actually has very little to do with this fic, but I recommend listening to it as it's a good song.

<lj-cut text=""Your mother warned you: Never fall in love with a Winchester."">


After witnessing her best friend's marriage and subsequent death over her son's cradle, your mother warned you: <em>Never fall in love with a Winchester. 

Bad news, that family. Them Winchesters are cursed, and cursed bad, blood and fire of a Winchester man too human to forgive his love's nature, shewed as it did with teeth and eyes and black words: fall in with them and bad luck'll be your lot, you hear me? 

Nothing good comes of Winchesters. Course, they're beautiful, the living damned always are, but these are made to kill the things they look to, be it flesh or soul, and what they love is just the same. 
Winchester's not just a namesake, boy. You better listen to your mama now</em>. 

You ignored her. 

You ignored the ring of truth in her voice, the timbre of something else speaking through and with your mother as it did when the prophecies were upon her. 

You ignored her.

It's the stupidest thing you've ever done. 

<center>*</center>

'Dude, did you see that guy?' 

'Whoa, tall --' 

'D'you know anything 'bout him? He's --' 

'Really hot --' 

'So fucking shy! What's up with that?' 

'Geek,' like it explains it all, and here it just might. 

'Oh, yeah,' a chorus of agreement. 'Definitely.' 

'But so hot.' 

'Phwoar!' 

'To die for,' Laura shouts. 'Totally!' 

You look over her head at the frosh just moving into your dorm, a tall quiet guy with a couple bags on him, who looks up from the door he's standing at, maybe his room, looks around, catches your eye. You get an impression of mossy eyes and brown skin, like a tree, and he knocks again. You think he's watching you, listening to Laura and Molly and Irving and Blue even though he can't possibly hear from that far away; you're all talking in whispers, aside from Laura who gets excitable the first few weeks of residency and talks way too loud most of the time, enough to set your ears ringing. You're all guessing names, Tony James Stan Shawn Tom Jerry Ben. Chica from Blue, because she thinks she's funny; Irving from Jen, ditto; Barry from Irving, ditto; you say 'Sam' for no reason at all and the guy looks up like he hears you. 

You meet his eyes. He blinks, holds steady, and offers a smile. 

He can't have possibly heard you, not over Laura's caterwauling about her class schedule. You smile back, point at your door, give him a thumbs up, and mouth your name. He flinches and when the door opens under his elbow, he falls inwards, away from you. 

<center>*</center> 

You see him again a week later; he's standing outside the same door, looking frustrated, bent over the doorhandle like he can't work out why it's not turning even if he tells it Open Sesame. You guess that he's learnt why being given the biggest room in this dorm is the Stanford version of drawing the very short straw. The extra space isn't a bonus, not when Eli comes with, and you almost pity him. Everyone hates Eli, and it's got nothing to do with the girls, the gold cards he tosses around like they're nothing, the phone calls at all hours of the day, shouting over the Top 40 music he's always got going. All of that would be bearable if not for the fact that Eli is an utter, utter bastard. 

'Hey,' you say, moseying up, hands in pockets. You'd flip up your collar, but you figure you can't get away with that inside. There's limits, even for people like you. 'Eli locked you out, huh?' 

'Yeah,' he huffs, and he's looking at you like he wants nothing better than you away from him, but he's too polite to say so outright. You look down at his hands, spying movement: you catch the curved ends of a pair of lockpicks disappearing into his hand, look back up at him. He's tense, you realise, all straightened curves. It reminds you of dealing with your stallions back home, your beloved Gryffin, that skittish wariness. 

You nod at his hands, raise an eyebrow, speak as jokingly as you can manage. 'Oh, hey, are those what I think they are? Good idea, man. I didn't learn to carry lockpicks around with me until, like, the fiftieth time I ended up climbing up a tree and in a window 'cause a my goddamnfucking roommates. You've used them before?' He relaxes a bit, grins reluctantly from under his bangs at you, even though he's like four inches taller. It makes you feel like you've just won the lottery. 

'I was thinking, uh, do I really wanna go in? 'Cause, uh --' He breaks off and tips his head to the door, uncomfortable, shifting in his skin. You lean close, press your ear to the door, and you hear the rhythmic bumps, a yowling that sounds like a sick cat but is really just Eli going at it for all he's worth, and grin. 

'Dude!' You flash your eyebrows, and he shifts from foot to foot, looking like he'd blush if he could. Gratified, you tip your head to your own door, blissfully empty of your roommates. 'Lets not interrupt their mad monkey love, eh?' You're practically cackling as you move away, and he seems just a tad relieved when you close the door of your own room behind his freakishly gigantic frame - it's like you don't realise just how big he is until you're way up close, and then <em>wham</em> - and the only sign that Eli exists is the occassional thrum of bass under your feet. 

'So, yeah, this is my space. Irving's out, but if you ever get sick of Eli, feel free to dump your stuff in here and we'll get you a key, or something, he won't mind.' You wave your arms at the room, heading for the minibar lined up precisely with the line dividing you and Irving, worked out to a fraction of an inch a week before. Your side is all rock posters, lined up with a spirit level, two inches between them and scribbled post-its already crawling down the blank spaces, framing Zeppelin and the Ramones and the Rolling Stones, those freakish diehards, and the rest of it is as messy as you can let it get without your skin crawling, which basically means that you can still see some of your desk. Irving's side isn't much to talk about: a desk, a bed, stacked books, shelves of more books. You're both neat freaks. It kind of shows. 

'Beer?' You hand him one without waiting for an answer, and snort when he looks at it dubiously like he doesn't even know what PBR's finest is. 'Yeah, yeah, you're underage, but guy like you - I'm betting you can take a beer or two.' You spin your chair around, sit down and lean your arms on the back. It creaks unpleasantly. You grin. 'You can, right?' 

'Huh? Oh, yeah. I, uh.' He sits down on your bed, stacking your engineering texts in alphabetical order. You don't think he realises he's doing it. 'I'm Sam, but, uh, I think you already figured that one out.' 

'Yeah, full ride, right? I'm James, James Dean, like the movie star. Everyone calls me Dean,' you say, and something in him twists his hands around the bottle. You've always tried not to watch people too closely, your mother's told you not to scare people off with your crazy curse about a gazillion times, but this Sam guy is practically holding the door open and what you see doesn't surprise you as much as it should.

'Got another James Dean in your head?' He looks up at you. You look back, and yeah, your horse-sense, people-sense, whatever, is going off like crazy. Something's used this guy wrong, and it's up to you to fix it, straighten out that head of his until he can move without running scared. You're not your mama, though, not a whisperer like her, so you're both buggered 'til you can work out something to do about all that age wound tight in Sam's head like a rattlesnake. 

'My big brother.' It sounds hollow. You're sensing capital-I Issues. You give him another beer; he's drained his somewhere along the way. When in doubt, beer. 'His name's Dean, too. He's, uh. My brother.' 

'Sounds like quite the guy.' 

Sam's head is throwing up hurt, anger, love, all twisted up, projecting so loudly your ears are ringing, and it's all you can do to keep your face on. 

'You've got brothers?' Sure, topic change. You can work with that if it means he'll stop throttling your precious PBR. 

'Not really. M'sisters are all in the marines, working overseas. It's just been me and my mom for the last coupla years, us and a whole bunch of animals, horses mostly, some dogs. All part of the family.' 

'Ever get coyotes?' His smile when he says that is just weird, like he knows something you don't, and you shift uncomfortably, scratch your head and dismiss it. 

Coversation goes from there, devolves into hunting, goes to guns, ammo, AC/DC versus Nirvana, to defense, blondes versus brunettes with the myriad possibilities of redheads, to the NRA, Texas death penalties, the horror of California's sales tax, and you find yourself reluctantly impressed. Guy's a brain, half again and then some, and his headspace's like few you've ever seen. 

Hot buttons are his brother, father family in general, some key words, but other than that, it's so fucking calm, his head. No obvious fears, just pervasive abstracted loss, the strung-out hope of a guy who doesn't know he's flat on the ground and thinks he's standing upright, whirling dark things with shadows and teeth that don't make any kind of impression against Sam's absolute denial of their existence. 

<center>*</center> 

The weirdness of it strikes three days after Sam leaves worse for wear with six PBR and some Jack in his gut, Eli's hollering into the hallway breaking the flow enough that you let him hightail it out of there. 

Since when does an angst-ridden freshman know about the kinds of things you've only ever gleaned off the minds of people you can't really describe as anything other than <em>hunters</em>? People who were colourless from the outside except to others like you who could see the brightness of metal and bone and blood cycling in their minds? Since when does a college freshman have enough slammed doors in his mind to fill an asylum? And how long has it been since you've seen someone clam up fast enough to slam you in the ass on your way out? 

Three hours with Sam, and you know you'll never get the answers to your questions. You suspect he doesn't know himself. So much turbulence in that deep, dark water, caused by the kind of conflict that you know from experience links to one of the basic questions, like <em>why</em>.

Like why, for example, he double-takes every time he sees you. You know he wants someone else in your place. You know that you resemble this other person a little too closely for Sam's comfort. You know that this gives you power that he doesn't necessarily want you to have. 

You know, logically, that you should stop. You're too gifted for this, you've probed too deep, and your curiosity has always been uncontrollable. 

But he smiled at you and you smiled back, and that's all it took to sell your soul to the mystery of Samuel Winchester.

<center>*</center>

It's hour seven of day three of cramming for finals and you're about to kill Sam, the gigantic freak, because your ass is numb, your back is threatening murder, your eyes are blurry, and Sam has shifted twice in that time: once to get a book from Laura, and once to piss. 
The only logical conclusion: Sam Winchester is an alien. 

'Sam my man,' you slur into his ear, and he shifts, throws you off and back to the ground with an apology. 

'Seriously,' you inform him, finger-pointing at his ugly mug, 'my ass is <em>numb</em>. Take a fucking break.'

'Nah, I'm good.' You stare. You're not surprised, but still. 

'Seriously?' 

He quirks a smile, does that thoughtful lip-curvy open-mouth put-the-rest-of-the-world-on-hold thing where he's thinking up the best way to verbally <em>own your ass</em>. You don't wait for it. 

'You need to get laid, man. Call up that hot ex of yours, whatshername, Lola, give her a goddamn break. Have wild kinky --' 

'Dean.' 

'It's true. You're a freak. You're a fucking huge celibate freak with nerves of steel, like Superman.' You pause, and let your face light up like a kid at Christmas. 'Hey, you'd totally make an awesome superhero! You've got the chest and the big manly hands and that stupid cleft chin, totally not fair, and the froofy hair and everything.' 

You pause for breath. He's ignoring you. Figures. You lean on his arm and breathe smelly beer breath into his ear, draping all over him like you're in the middle of a Minnesota winter and he's the last working space heater on earth. 

'Only you can save mankind, Super Sam!' 

He shrugs you off and you slam back into the bedpost. He's already apologising when you wave him away and check for blood. 'Dude, lay off, just some gigantic chick laying eggs.' 

Sam looks downright constipated, but he shrugs and goes back to the books, spread around him in a semi-circle and encroaching on his legs, pages overlapping each other, all of them dogeared and splashed with caffeine from past students, some of them with notes that made no sense, even upside down. It strikes you to take a picture with your phone. It's so Sam, this whole setup of beer and books and his shitty laptop blinking behind him, and this is what you'll show people later when you say <em>My friend Sam</em> and they inevitably ask who he is. 

You're both on the floor of your and Irving's room: as you predicted, Sam hasn't quite moved out of Eli's room into yours, but all his stuff is here, taking up surprisingly little space next to your desk, and he sleeps in your bed when you let him know you're out for the night. In return, your minifridge is always stocked with PBR and he studies with you when you're too tired or drunk to discipline yourself into actually learning something. Like a pity-fuck, you think vaguely, but with study instead of sex. 

You wonder if study and sex are the same thing to Sam. The way he touches books so gently, his face when he comes across something he didn't know he didn't know, his pleasure at inhaling information like a human sponge, you wouldn't be surprised. Hell, the way he's stroking those pages right now, mouth open and his eyebrows all pinched together, it's pure porn, the slow gorgeous kind that drives you up the wall. Godamned geek.

'Come on, dude. My head hurts like a motherfucker.' 
He doesn't even look up when he tells you that if you could be sober for more than five minutes, headaches wouldn't be a problem. You look away, back to the words that blur and swim and jump in and out of focus. 

You don't bother to explain the effect alcohol has on you, how much you need it to block out the stray thoughts, this goddamned empathy that has you wound up tighter than steel springs in the middle of cram week, the way it makes the frustration and worry of everyone around you, even Sam, become bearable background noise. It's still sharp and grating, but it's at least out of focus. 

You've never told anyone except your mother, who smiled and told you that she already knew you took after her side of the family. It's aged you, you know that much. Too many souls laid bare for your viewing, too many bared secrets better left hidden. You think it's why Sam likes you so much. 

Three months of Sam, and you're starting to understand that he holds his secrets locked away so tightly that he's not even aware of them, that his mind is a place more dangerous than you first thought. You lost your curiosity the first night he woke up sweating from a dream you were glad he didn't remember. Truth has never been palatable for you.

'I'm gonna go for some shots, shoot some pool, grab a girl. Come with?' 

'Nah, I'll man the fort,' he says, not even paying attention, but he asks very carefully, 'Coming back?' Sam code for <em>Can I sleep in your bed and oh for the love of Sweet Jesus say yes</em>. 

You say yes. He grins up at you, and you are reminded why you work so hard to preserve every last piece of his innocence: that damned smile. 

You stammer something about hitting up every piece of ass you can find and stumble out, wincing at the streetlights in your eyes. You look straight at one without blinking until your eyes twist themselves out of focus, watering, and it hurts like a bitch and a half but It takes your mind off Sam's guilt stabbing its way through your head. 

<center>*</center> 

There's a guy outside your door. 

He's a little taller than you, way stronger by the set of his shoulders. He turns and tips his chin at you, an invitation to explain why this particular door is locked to him. You knew who he was before you walked in, and you marvel at the contrast of what you felt from his mind and what you see now, standing toe-to-toe with someone alike enough to be your twin. Guy's a headcase, no two ways about it. Just means the mutual resemblance cuts deeper than superficial height and colouring. 

'Hi, I'm James, James Dean like the movie star.' You offer a hand. 'Dean Winchester, like the gun, right? Sam's not said much about you.' 

He snorts, like he didn't expect anything else from his little brother, but his eyes say different. His handshake is firm, even more heavily callused than Sam's: you catalogue the rough scrape of his palm and conclude that this guy is on a whole other level from the hunters you've seen. 

'Yeah, m'Dean. I was kinda hoping to see Sammy around.' 

'You're fresh out of luck,' you tell him. It's not quite a lie. 'He's tied up with the campus counsellors, getting his classes in order.' 

Your head is already promising a migrane from the conflict in Dean's mind, anger and fear augmented by latent power so strong you think you're maybe going blind. You slip so easily between the layers of who he is, who he purports to be, who he believes himself to be, that you're surprised when you catch the core of who he is: a memory of fire and a love demanding everything given to it in whole and a dead mother and an infant, heavy and fragile in arms barely long enough to carry his brother.

<em>A smile to die for</em>. You curse yourself and run out of his head, his memories dogging your heels, <em>Sammy Sammy Sammy Sammy</em> calling after you in a voice not your own. You should have known. 

'Ah, damnit,' he says easily, like he didn't notice your hasty retreat, and you think maybe he actually didn't. 'How long's it gonna take?'

You never thought you'd meet a bonafide hero, but there Dean is, eyes squinting and narrowing at the intrusion you know he's starting to sense the echoes of, and you block yourself off entirely, leaving you with only your own thoughts for company. Any more of his mind and you think you might start screaming. 

'Forever. The queue's a block long, last I checked. Dunno about you, but there's a beer down at the bar with my name on it,' you offer. 'Wanna grab one while you're waiting around? I could tell you all about Sam's wild geek adventures in the campus libraries.'

He tips a smile. 'Nah, I gotta get going. I just wanted to check in, really, 'cause, ah.' You involuntarily catch <em>doesnt fucking wanna talk to me</em> before he stops himself and redirects with a speed that's just plain impressive. 'Winchesters, we're not the greatest at answering phones, y'know? Anyway, uh, good to meet you. Later.' 

'He's fine,' you say to his retreating back, and he stops, doesn't turn. This, at least, you can say. 'He misses you a lot, but the kid's more stubborn than a fucking mule. Pulling through fine.' You wait, but he doesn't move, and you decide you could maybe risk it. 'Shall I tell him you were here?'

He stiffens and keeps going for the stairs like he never broke his stride in the first place, and his voice is yes-ma'am-it's-awfully-cold-out casual. 'Nah, don't bother.'  

Watching him walk away, you wonder if meeting him for five minutes is reason enough to grieve for what Dean Winchester might have been. 

<center>*</center>

The next day, Sam curls a fist in your shirt in the middle of explaining the intricacies of Latin ablatives and kisses you. He looks surprised when you push him away and ask him if he wants to do this, really wants to. He nods, and you lean into him with tongue and teeth and all of the longing you felt from his brother. You pull away, still close enough to taste his breath, close enough to see that he's searching your face for something you don't have and looking like just maybe what you do have will be enough. 

You consider what to say next; Sam looks spooked by his own daring, and he's lifting his hand out of your shirt, uncertain if to touch you or not. You tilt your head back to show throat, shift back against your bed and sprawl out a little more, glance at him from under your eyelashes in the way you know snares men and women faster than you can say Dixie. 

'Wanna practice on me some more?' Sam ducks his head and gives you that shy, brilliant grin. You pull him in between your knees and he smiles into your mouth.  You slant him a look when he pulls back for air, looking just a little shellshocked and not a little relieved and whole lot like wants to dive straight back in. You know how he feels, with that thrum of <em>want</em> and the pulse of your blood in the fingertips you press to his jaw. 

'This mean we can stop pussyfooting around?' He looks startled, and you sigh, get to your feet and park your butt on the bed, tugging him upwards and up and up; sometimes you forget just how tall he is. He's standing over you, looming's more like it, and you hook your fingers through the loops on his jeans and lean in, eye level with his dick. You look up and give him your best <em>fuckmenow</em> smile. 

'I'm going to suck out your brains through your dick,' you say slowly and clearly, 'and then tomorrow I'm gonna do it again. That cool with you?' 

He nods, eyes gone all dark just the way you like them, and grabs at the wall behind you when you dig your fingers in and yank everything down at once, zipper, jeans and briefs sliding to midthigh. 'Easy there, tiger,' you say to his twitching dick with a laugh. He growls, the sound curling your toes, and you get to it, making good on everything you've promised with your eyes and mouth. 

You're still not quite what he wants. His hands trace scars you don't have and linger in all the wrong places. But it's close enough that it almost doesn't matter when Sam moans your name with an intensity not meant for you. 

<center>*</center>

The next time Dean shows up, you're waiting, freshly fucked and mussed, taking a breather, hand curled around a cigarette. He takes one look at you and <em>knows</em>. You know that he can smell Sam on you, can see all that you've done to his brother. All that Sam has done to you, aware-unaware he was wishing for someone else instead. Someone like you, and yet not you.

Neither of you say anything. You both know which one Sam's waiting for, and which one's just filling in time.

<center>*</center>

It's a year to the exact day you first saw him in the hall as a skinny little freshman with too much baggage and not enough luggage when you realise he's fallen in love with you, or the idea of you, or both. 

You're so fucking screwed and you can't remember why. 

<center>*</center>

'Dude,' Laura says, and you nod in tired agreement. 'Dude,' she says again, stamping her foot. '<em>Dude</em>!' Sam doesn't look up, feverishly writing notes from books looking old enough to warrant preservation under lock and key, in languages you're pretty sure are dead, and this isn't like him, to ignore both you and Laura. 

Besides, he's at your desk. You have every right to kick him down to the bar. But you're not sure you want to try. You can't get much out of his head other than a worried urgency and a sense of too little, too late that makes the hairs on the back of your neck prickle. 

Laura solves your dilemma by grabbing the book Sam's holding and slamming it shut on Sam's fingers. He yelps and scowls black murder. It occurs to you that Sam has four inches and fifty pounds to his advantage, even sitting down, and that pissing him off right now might not be the best idea. 'What the hell was that for?' 

'You're coming with us,' she tells him, jabbing her fingers into his chest. 'I don't care what you're doing, Sam, I don't care if you're working for the fucking Peace Corps or the goddamned Army, you're stopping right now and you're coming with us.' Sam looks at you for explanation, and you shrug an apology. You've been trying to get his attention for the last hour and grabbed Laura from across the hall as a last resort. Sam's expression is the bitchiest you've ever seen on a guy. He starts trying to placate both of you with his Sam Winchester the Salesman voice, all lowered eyelashes and earnest hands and sincerity. 

'Seriously, guys, this is important, I gotta finish this tonight, so I'll just take a raincheck, and we can party later -' 

You call bullshit. Laura isn't convinced either. 'I don't give a shit, Sam. You're coming with us.' She pulls on his arms and he stands a little, just enough for you to pull the chair out from under him. He lands on his ass and glares up at you. You grin. It's pretty funny. 

'Sorry, dude. You're all ghostly. It's not a good look, man.' You lean down to pull him up.

'Just 'cause we fuck doesn't mean you don't need to pull chicks sometime. College is all about playing the field.' You waggle your eyebrows suggestively. Sam blanches, and from the look he gives you, shocked and startled, it wasn't the eyebrows that made him look like he's about to lose his lunch. You give him your biggest and most innocent smiile and and he loosens up enough that you can push him out into the hallway, Laura locking your room behind you with a laugh covered as a cough. He shakes his head, anger coiled in his fists, and sighs. 'How long do I have to be there?' 

'Until you get laid or too drunk to walk,' you tell him cheerfully, clapping a hand on his shoulder and dragging him with you. Laura takes up position on Sam's other side, her arm locked with his to stop him from bolting. 'It'll be fun.' 

'For whom?' Sam sounds so martyred that you roll your eyes at the entire universe, including the fact that Sam is the only person you know who cares enough about persnickety English rules to actually say <em>whom</em>. You brush his mind and catch worry, annoyance, and a deep-seated, hopeless resignation that curls in your gut. Those chicken wings suddenly don't look like such a good idea, but you've been planning this for weeks and you're not about to back out now. 

The bar's not that far away. You and Laura try to cheer Sam up, but nothing's working, and you think you know what will, but you're not quite sure. It bothers you that you're not sure, but you'll see. You make one of the most tasteless jokes you've ever made in your life just to see him squirm away, and you try not to make it sound as though you're saying goodbye even though you totally are.

Irving and Jen are already at a table, and you spy Blue at the counter, chatting up some longhaired geek surprised enough by her approach to keep talking to her without breaking down into shyness. You can't see your quarry anywhere, so you make for the table, already littered with shot glasses in Irving's neat two by two squares. He looks up at you with the glassy clear gaze of a confirmed alcoholic and nods at the women's bathrooms. You laugh, relieved, and push Sam into a chair, collecting orders and bumping Blue with your hip as you squeeze past her to holler at the bartender. 

When you get back, hands full of drinks, you see a wealth of blonde hair, hear a drawling Southern Californian accent, and she spins around with a laugh to take the drinks from you and hand them around, eventually passing a shotglass to Sam. 

'Tequila slammers, right? Ever do it with salt and lemon?' Sam looks overwhelmed, but Jessie, your gorgeous darling Jessie, pecks him on the cheek and lifts her glass. 'To new friends! I'm Jess, Jessica Moore, and you are?' 

'Sam Winchester,' Sam says quietly, clinking their glasses. He drains his shot, watching her with the fascination of a child seeing something unexpected, and she swallows fire-breath. 

'Oooh, I'll never get used to that.' Sam's eyes follow her wrist as Jessie pushes back her hair, the better to sass Irving, and you hide a smile behind your bourbon. 

The others contrive to keep Jess and Sam in each other's company all night, every one of them being in on your brilliant plan to set them up. You pride yourself on your eye for matchmaking, and Jessie is just that right combination of familarity, normality and herself for Sam WInchester to come crawling out of his shell. 

You noticed it when she saw Sam leaving your room several weeks ago and she looked at his back and tilted her head at you, a silent question. It clicked when Sam saw <em>her</em> leaving and he looked fascinated, smiling at her like he half-knew her. You felt the pull in their minds, and had the beginnings of a plan. 

It looks like it's paying off, and you cadge half of Irving's Jack, inordinately pleased with yourself. Your mind's eye overlays with what you see, and Jessie shines bright, bright, bright like a beacon, a raw gift for people and animals and life, one of the strongest healers you know. She's your cousin on your mother side, and when you told her how brightly she shone, she laughed and told you that it was her calling. She saved you, once. You think maybe you've repaid your debt, and from her glance at you, her flushed happiness as she coaxes Sam onto the dance floor, she thinks so too.

You've always been Jessie's poor cousin, and you don't resent Sam for choosing her at first sight, first touch, and letting himself forget, just for a little while, all about you and the man whose space you don't quite fill. It's how things have always been with you and Jessie, and you gave up resisting it a long time ago. Instead, you wish them luck, happiness, health, love. 

They're beautiful together in all the ways that you can see. 

<center>*</center>

'She looks like mom,' Dean says quietly, foot up on the bench and hands in his pockets. 'A lot like mom.' 

'I know.' He looks down at you, interrogative. 'He has a picture. I don't think he knows.'  

'Nah, he wouldn't.' There's a minefield in that statement you don't even want to think about touching, but Dean just gives you a tight-lipped smile. 'Lucky for me, I'm not so into blondes anymore.' 

You automatically glance at his ring, and he follows your eyes, looks back at you. It's the most honest you've ever seen him, stripped raw. You get the impression you're one of the few to ever notice what that ring symbolises. 

You dare to ask. In the past year and three months, you feel you've come to know this man by the gaps he left in Sam, by his constant, low-lying presence in Sam's mind, overlaid with your image, in turn overlaid with his, until there's no telling where he ends and you begin in Sam's mind. 'Where is she now?' 

'I don't know,' he says, and means it with a grief so strong that it draws you in against your will. 

You catch shreds of memory: a smiling girl, olive eyes and blonde frizz, the sound of hard-edged laughter, a sprawl of jeaned legs, the butterfly press of a kiss to your temple. A little girl, eyes like her mother, her father's full mouth, two hands with identical silver rings linked over the happy babble of their daughter sitting on their interlocked knees. 

Memory spirals past you: some minds are random, collated through impressions of sight, or date and time, but this man operates by emotion, and all you see in his mind as <em>love</em> files past: the woman again, his daughter, a vague warmth that must be his mother, the broad planes of John Winchester's face creased in approval, and as always Sam, a presence filed under every emotion Dean has ever had except <em>hate</em>.

Dean's mind turns to that now, veering through dizzying twists and turns, nausea rising until you force yourself to stop trying to take any of it in. Everything slams to a stop. You take your hands away from your eyes, drop your muffling shields, and recoil.

You see the sprawl of a dead woman, carved like so much meat, the unpleasant angle of her neck, and it would be silent but for the muffled sobs of a little girl, tucked into the curve of the woman's body with her eyes squeezed shut. The girl clutches the woman's cooling hand and whimpers in pain, squeezing so tight that her fingernails break on the woman's ring. It's the only clean thing in that place of shadows and blood, and the flash of it draws your eyes. 

You swallow vomit and pull back into the California winter sunshine. You didn't want to know. 

'My wife is dead,' Dean says, and you look up. You realise he's been watching you. You realise that he knows what you are, what you can do. He deliberately let you into his mind, directed you through everything you just saw with the finesse of a master filmmaker. You just don't know why. 

'My daughter.' He swallows audibly, throat clicking. 'My daughter is dead.' His smile is as sharp-edged as that of the woman he'd loved so deeply, worn down by horrors you'll never comprehend to the briefest quirk of lips and show of teeth. The glance you got at his wife through Dean's eyes made your skin crawl. You know he knows what she was, humanity fitting like a badly-sewn suit, but you don't know if he knows just what she gave up by taking his name. You hope he doesn't.

'Sam doesn't know.' He's fierce, intent, and you realise with a jolt that you are being warned. 'He can't ever know.' He goes on to explain without giving you a chance to respond. 

'It's a Winchester thing. A curse, passed down. Dad thinks I don't know, but every marriage, hell, every fucking relationship or friendship or anything, as far back as I could trace it, ended - badly. Really fucking badly.'

 He shrugs, stiff and one-shouldered, falling apart even as you watch him try to hold it together. 
It's so fresh in his mind that it clouds everything else, like the sunbaked afternoons sprawled on his car with his wife-to-be were just yesterday, the bloody aftermath of his family a few seconds before. 

You think of your mother. 

'I'm sorry,' you begin, and he cuts you off with an irritable wave of his hand, so transparent in his grief, his need to protect his brother. 

'Just keep him safe. Let him be happy for a while. God knows it's all he's ever gonna get.'  

You study him. He takes the scrutiny without flinching, looking back with everything that he is, everything that's made him: sacrifice, love, a duty to his brother leaving everything else in its wake. You nod. There's nothing you can bring yourself to say. 

'Okay.' He scrubs his palms over his face and through his hair, wound so tight you're afraid his bones will snap. 'Fuck. Okay.' You turn away, unable to watch him put himself back together with such painstaking care. 

You count grass seeds until the echoes of his daughter's newborn hands, curling around your finger as her mother laughed and called you sunshine, have died away.

<center>*</center>

Sam still sleeps in your room when he's not at Jessie's, but it's on the floor instead of in your bed with you wrapped around him. You wake up late one night and sit up with a groan, cursing your popping joints, and you see his eyes are open, watching you, and you suck in a breath as he starts talking. 'Hey, man. I, uh. About Jess -' 

'It's cool, dude.' You sink on top of him, straddling his hips, put your hands on his chest and face. It's a familiar position, one you've taken a thousand times, and your thighs are moulded to the jut of Sam's hipbones. You bend forward, brushing his lips with your own, and he holds himself still. 

'Never said you were mine, anyway, and I wasn't really yours, so it's all peachy. Yeah? College fling.' It hurts to say that, and his eyes widen, like maybe it hurt him too. You've never been sure, when it comes to you, how much of you he loves and how much of it is because you're so much like his brother. 

Sam makes like he's going to say something, eyes going soft and serious and the breath he takes is deep enough to lift you an inch or two into the air, but you're not in the mood for any kind of confession or whatever the hell Sam thinks he owes you. You bend and roll your hips over his dick. His breath hisses through his teeth and you laugh, just a little drunk with how much power you still have over him after two and a half months. 

'Dean,' he starts, and you cut him off, kiss as brutal and devastating as you know how. 

'Let's have one for the road, huh?' 

'I didn't mean,' he tries, breaking off when you grind down on him. 

'Not a good time, Sam,' you warn, and he tries again,  persistent fucker. 

'I think I - I'm sorry - I don't -' 

'I know,' you say, because you do. 'It's okay.' 

It's when you're sinking down onto him, fucked open and begging for it, your head thrown back and your nails digging half-moons into his thighs that he groans, 'I missed you, God, Dean, I missed you,' and you pretend he means someone else. It's easy to do.

You crawl out of his bed afterwards, your muscles screaming bloody murder, and he catches your wrist, tugs you back against him. Not for the first time, you stare at his skin, dark against yours, his arms overlapping around you, a cold nose on your neck, and think that if he wanted to, he could break you in half. 

You're nowhere near as strong as him or his brother; your physique is mass-produced from the gym, not hardened from years of fighting things stronger and faster than you, and you've never had the need for strength. Your power is in the mind, and you've broken a few over the years. You can break Sam faster than he can break you. It's the only reason you tolerate being held so close, you tell yourself. 

'I talked to Jess.' Sam's breathing is quiet, ragged in you ear. His dick is heavy and soft against your thigh. 'She says she's cool with - this. If you wanted.' You shift closer to him, and you hope he'll accept that as an answer. But Sam being Sam, he has to be sure. 'Do you? I'm not just going to leave it like this, Dean,' and his tone of familiar exasperation is so intimate that you squeeze your eyes shut against it. 

'Yeah. Yeah, I want.' 

You feel Sam smile against the back of your neck, taking his hands from your wrists and settling onto his stomach, keeping you flush against him. 'One for the road. Jesus, Dean.' You headbutt his chin and tell him to shut up. 

It occurs to you to wonder if Sam's last memory of you will be baptised in blood, like Dean's of his wife, or fire, like John Winchester's of their mother. You turn in the warm double circle of his arms and kiss him. 

His mouth tastes like ash.

<center>*</center>

Sam tells you about his LSATs with a sort of pleased shock, counterbalanced by Jessie next to him, warm and laughing with that eye-crinkling smile Sam likes so much. You look at her and sense: pride, worry about Sam's studying habits, an absent-minded reminder to pick up more cake flour. 

You look at Sam and sense fear and fire. You sense truth making up for lost time. 

All of a sudden, you feel tired, so very tired, even as you offer up a smile and a double thumbsup, the obligatory mockery about your golden boy doing what he did best. You ask about his family, the way you do every so often, just to check that he hasn't burnt more of those bridges, because as often as Dean calls and shows up, thirsty for random trivia, he never talks about Sam. 

Sam looks at you, slides his eyes away, looks back with a defiance that doesn't surprise you as he says, 'They don't know. It doesn't matter. I got a 174,' like that matters more than a brother ticking down the days and minutes to the anniversary of his mother's death by hellfire.

The monsters in Sam's mind, for all that they inhabit the dark, aren't so different from what you see in daylight. But you envy him their honesty.

You never told him. He would never understand that there was no safe place to be had, no ignorance to hide behind: all he did in leaving his family was trade one set of dark, horrible truths for another. You never told him that he made a gamble, and lost. 

You don't say this to him now. You don't tell him that the dreams he's been having all along are true. His mind always tasted of slowly maturing up until the past week when it started to hang on the back of your tongue like his come, thick enough to choke.

You don't tell him that suit he took out of your closet and dusted off for interviews will serve well enough at the funeral, you don't tell him to remember that Jessie's favourite flowers are delphinums, and you don't tell him to be kind to his brother who looks and <em>sees</em> and suffocates and loves Sam anyway, just like you. 

That sweet smell of meat and fire pouring off him these days gags anything you could ever say to him, turns it to Jessie's ashes, the sour bile that will rise to Dean Winchester's mouth when he senses with sharp, fierce clarity what Sam sees at that moment on the ceiling above his bed. 

You've never been strong enough, or brave enough, to speak the truth. 

Instead, you say, 'wow, man, that sucks. Wonder what they'd think of you now, golden boy?' and toss him another bottle of beer. You don't say what you're thinking, measured in the spaces between Jess and Sam's heartbeats: <em>I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry.</em>

You look at them, their laughter washing over you, and you decide that this will be your last memory of them. 

<center>*</center>

Sam doesn't call or write. You're not surprised. 

Sam's a Winchester, and Winchesters can't afford to look back at the things they leave behind.

<center>*</center>

When the demon comes for you, you look her in the eye and tell her that she's wasting her time. Sam never loved you. 

She asks if you're sure. You hesitate. The demon laughs. 

You can see Sam sleeping underneath you in the grottiest motel room you've ever seen, and there's a searing pain across your belly, a tightness in your chest. 

You can't breathe. You can't apologise for everything you never said, for everything he never knew you knew. 

Your mouth opens, and you feel blood rise, thick and choking. 

You see Sam wake up beneath you, the curious numbness spreading, and you know that your death is Sam's nightmare and prophecy all at once. He says your name, his name, <em>Dean</em>, and screams. You know then that the demon is wrong. 

Sam is not seeing you on the ceiling in flames above him. He is seeing Dean, has forgotten the differences between you both. He has forgotten you, plain and simple, or more likely never bothered to know you at all. You were a living shadow of a man far greater than yourself, and this is the only use left for you now.

As you scream and the fire finally makes itself felt, you think that perhaps you should have listened to your mother. You're dying just as she said you would: on the ceiling above the Winchester you love. 

She never told you it would hurt this much.

"event","quickie for <lj user=sparklespiff>. akudan, getting back into the swing of it. move along, nothing to see here. 

<lj-cut text=""firsts."">The first time Akutsu sees their names written together, he thinks it's a mistake. Everything that'd put them together in any way always has their names as far apart as possible: school documents, seperated by year, behaviour, grades, ages, sections. Even the forms listing their participation in tennis tournaments back when Akutsu still played always had Akutsu at the top or second in the list, and Dan at the very bottom. He's never really paid much attention to it before now, but he's never seen them written together before. It's weird and disturbing and he's not sure if he likes the skittish feeling it gives him, like it's too obvious, too much exposure. 

It's Dan's notebook, he sees now: pink, because Dan is a girl, and thin, spiral bound even though Akutsu always takes them away before he manages to hurt himself, and with their names written together on the front page in pencil. Akutus's above, Dan's below. Akutsu Jin, Dan Taichi, forming a diamond, a gap between the arches of their names. Waiting for something to fill it. There's no heart drawn there, nothing so fucking cute (even though he'd bet that Dan is exactly the type to draw hearts, that fuckwit) as a bunch of flowers or whatever, but there may as well be. 

Irrationally, he gets the urge to tell Dan off for daring to even know his name. He should be pissed off that he's written down in some fucking pansy notebook for anyone to come across and see what the hell it's doing on campus, left behind in the grass under the (their) tree like it was, and make him a fucking laughingstock. He should be. But mostly it's just really fucking weird. The concept of them together in any way, shape or form is something he's had ages to get used to; Dan just won't leave him alone, and Akutsu's about to give up trying to make the persistent little shit let go. But this is different, this is their names written down with nothing to explain it except the fucking obvious assumption, where anyone could see it and Akutsu can't deny it. 

He's not the guy girls write their names down with.  The names up on the walls and in lockers are always the other boys, the fucking preppy ones with trendy haircuts and muscle that might as well be fat for all that it stops his fists from landing where he wants them. It doesn't matter, how annoying and useless and so fucking ignorant they are. They still get giggles following them down the corridor and the pretty, nice girls just as soft as they are lining up to go out on nicey-nice shopping trips holding hands. They're the ones getting Valentines and invitations to parties and Sunday night dinner with the parents. They're the ones they want to be with; Akutsu's the one they just want to fuck, to touch for a while and reassure themselves that they're nothing like him. He's different and dangerous and yeah, it gets him his share, but they don't ever want to keep him. Not enough to write his goddamn name, or bother to find out what it even is. 

It occurs to him that this is the first time he's seen his name written down like this. Just a simple, innocuous pairing, like they're any guy and girl getting teased for  flirting and cooing enough to make any man with a set of balls want to gag. It's weird, to think that Dan thinks of them like that. That he even could.

He's not exactly sure how long he stands there, looking past and down at the grass, notebook looking so fucking small in his great big ugly hands, but it's a while; long enough that he looks up and finds the shadows in a different place from where they were when he first started. It's been long enough for Dan to come find him, at least, blinking up at him like Akutsu is some kind of avenging angel, rescuing his beloved notebook from the evil clutches of Lord Grass and his Army of Three-Corrnered Jacks. He doesn't trust his voice, just hands it back, still open to that first page. He really shouldn't  give it back; Dan will find a way to injure himself with it eventually, take out his own eye or something typically clueless like that. But he wants to know what Dan's got to say for himself, if he's got anything at all; if he notices anything weird about writing their fucking names down. 

'Am I in trouble, Akutsu-sempai?' So fucking small, so fucking tiny. Akutsu bets he could crush Dan's skull in his hands if he wanted to, and the fucking scary thing is that Dan would probably let him. It's like having a fucking kid, for Chrissakes. 

'You damn well should be,' he manages to grind out. 'What the fuck were you fucking thinking?' It's a pathetic attempt, and Dan just looks confused, like he's grown another head. Akutsu feels like maybe he has; it's near enough to the wobbling, churning feeling in his gut, same as he gets when he's at the top of those ferris wheels and the whole thing shudders and jerks and sways around to a stop. It's being way up high and falling all at once, and he looks at Dan and thinks, even as Dan protests that he didn't know he shouldn't do it, that he won't do it again, and by the way, what did he do, Akutsu-sempai?, that this is one of those moments that he has to thank Dan for someday. 

Not that Dan will ever get it, but Akutsu can feel it, his grip loosening on Dan's shoulder, focused more on what the hell he'll cook for dinner tonight when they're flat out of food rather than the brawl he plans to start beforehand. Just one of those moments in a long line of moments where he can say he feels almost human. And inevitably, it's all Dan's fault, the little fucking fuckwitted cocksucking simpleton. 

Akutsu gives in, just the once, and ruffles Dan's hair, brushing through it and thinking to himself that he really needs a haircut, at least a decent trim that doesn't look like it was made using the rim of a soupbowl as a guide. It's harsher than he likes, but he can't really give in all at once, can he? He'd have to pull out his own teeth just to avoid rotting them. 

'Doesn't fucking matter, Taichi. You'd better not be going home without me.' 

'Of course not, Akutsu-sempai!' 

Dan falls into step next to him, and it's almost actually okay, like the sign over his head isn't 'fucking asshole' or 'mad, bad and dangerous to know' but just 'Akutsu Jin', with 'Dan Taichi' floating next to his shoulder. 

As a first, he guesses it's alright.</lj-cut>"

"event","<strong>Title:</strong> Sometimes You Win With Loaded Dice
<strong>Author:</strong> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)  
<strong>Fandom:</strong> Guys and Dolls 
<strong>Pairing:</strong> Sky Masterson/Nathan Detroit
<strong>Rating:</strong> R, NC-17.
<strong>Author's Notes:</strong> This was written after my umpteenth rewatch of Guys and Dolls, movie musical version starring Jean Simmons, Marlon Brando, Vivian Blaine and Frank Sinatra, in one three-hour sitting. Inspired mainly by the quote line. Starts way before the movie timeline, mentions events in the movie but I'm not sure if you'd have to actually watch to get it, and ends at some vague point after the end. Total timespan is about thirty years. It's sort of an experiment in POV and progression. Some details don't precisely fit in with canon - for example the time betweeen Nathan and Sky's meeting in Mindy's and the next scene seems to be very narrow, but I hope that some small liberties don't matter much. I'm not sure that this piece worked out the way I wanted it to, but oh well! Some mangled grammar, but it's almost all intentional. 


<em>You're not in love with Nathan.' 
'No, I'm not.' </em> 
-- Adelaide and Sky Masterson, <em>Guys and Dolls</em> 

<lj-cut text=""Nathan Detroit would like to make one thing perfectly clear.

He does not like Sky Masterson."">

<strong>i.</strong> 
Sky remembers the first time as clear as his first hand of poker at five with his daddy's watchful eyes. The thickness of his father's cigars in his mouth, their richness lent in no small part by their being pilfered after Tuesday craps right under his daddy's nose, is much the same as Nathan Detroit's cock. Nathan is cologne and secrets and thin, wiry hair that clings to the sticky corners of his lips, curls around Sky's fingers when he brushes them away. Nathan tastes like a Jew should, guilt and Mindy's cheesecake and Adelaide's greasy lipstick. 

When Sky gets to his feet, a smile playing on his lips, Nathan eyes him like he's just suddenly discovered him there, a box to be cracked open, a boy too smooth for his own good. His luck preceeds him everywhere it goes, and it lends a helping hand now, the door into the garage opening just as Nathan's fingers have finished settling his pants, fingers smoothing Brylcreme out of his hair and onto his collar. It's Harry the Horse, telling them to get their shit together and meet the boys out back in five for another round. 

They all know that Sky will win; the only question is how much. With stakes like these, it could be as little as a thousand, as high as fifty or a hundred. These are the kinds of sky-high stakes Sky likes to play, and everyone knows it. Especially Nathan Detroit, who just had a scorching blowjob against the trunk of someone's getaway car, a wall of sheet metal with a rough frame of a door the only thing between them and twenty highrolling gamblers all too happy to put a bullet in Nathan's head. Sky doesn't kid himself. He's <i>good</i>. Good enough to stack his mouth against those odds and still come out top. 

'That was damned close. Too damned close,' Nathan says, like he can't quite believe what he just did, or more accurately what he just let Sky do to him. From where Sky's standing, he's not exactly hearing any protests about that. Like he said -- he's good. Damned good. He gives Nathan his traditional half-smile, rolling across his face like butter. 

A face for sin and liars, his daddy said once. A face that could cheat the devil of his own soul given a round or two. <i>A face too pretty by half</i>, his daddy had said. <i>Don't you ever let anyone hold it against you, boy. You've got the looks, might as well use them.</i> He doesn't think his daddy meant it like this. Then again, his daddy's been dead five years and more, the Lord rest his soul, and Sky's long past his daddy's faith in salvation. 

'Them's the odds I like to see,' and Nathan's face closes over, straightens into its angles and lines.

'You're too young for this, kid. Give it a coupla years.' Lord, but Nathan's too damned honest for the games he plays, and a soft touch at that. Sky's seventeen, but the only one who'll ever know that is him. His license says he's twenty-two and the day he dies that bit of plastic will still say he's twenty-two. 

'Not too young to do what I just did.' He smiles again, shifts it into that damned smirk that made seasoned gamblers shift uncomfortably in their seats and dolls cream their panties. Nathan reacts with a sideways slant of his eyes, squinting like he needs glasses, blunt-nailed hands dropping to his sides, jamming into his pockets like an overgrown schoolboy. Sky waits. He could stand here all day in the encroaching sunlight, watching Nathan make up his mind, acknowledge the inevitable. Nathan squints at his shoes, spits out something that could've been tobacco or a wad of paper. 

'Fine,' Nathan conceeds. 'Go ahead. But don't come whining to me if Society Max cleans you out.' It's an idle threat and they both know it. If anyone, Nicely-Nicely is the threat; but Nicely-Nicely is just a little <i>too</i> nice, too careful, to present a serious challenge. Sky will win today, he thinks, be it one or twenty thousand, and he's just as certain that Nathan won't be able to keep his hands off him. Not for long. 

That thought gives him a certain frission of power as he follows Nathan into the dim smoke that still makes his eyes water and his nose burn. It's exactly like every one of a thousand gambling halls he'll ever see, and he smiles in the knowledge that this will be yet another lucky day. 


<strong>ii.</strong> 
Nathan Detroit would like to make one thing perfectly clear.

He does not like Sky Masterson. 

Sky is trouble personified in six feet of golden skin and white teeth and crisp suits. Nathan does not like trouble. He has enough on his plate with the game and Adelaide and whatisname, Brannigan and his damned heat that he insists on cranking up every time Nathan so much as breathes craps. He arranges the games. He finds a place. He tries to keep Adelaide from smothering him and eats at Mindy's every day in the knowledge that she'll never eat with him because of her neverending diets. In the meantime, he gets a decent cut, enough to eat at Mindy's every day, and spends his time avoiding long-term commitment and keeping his hands to himself. 

But Sky Masterson is trouble. Nathan does not like trouble. He does not like trouble for the simple reason that when it finds him, it is always diabolically attractive. It makes him do things that cut deep into the limits of how much crap Adelaide will let him get away with. Regret is not an appreciated quality in a gambler and he likes to stay away from it as much as possible. That he never regrets anything he does with Sky Masterson is irrelevant. It's the point of the thing. 

To Nathan, Sky is one of Adelaide's books, nosy and omnipresent and with words that are too long and sentences that hover just out of reach, like if maybe he got off his lazy ass and made something of himself, he'd be normal enough to understand. But it's worse than that. Sky is one of those books with footnotes and endnotes and six different kinds of appendices and four introductions, bound in leather and wrapped up with a neat black ribbon to mark the place. One of those books with the tiny smudged text that just went to prove Nathan's belief that reading made people go blind. 

Nathan's never had the patience for reading anything more than people. He's cunning enough where he has to be, and he's good enough at it that he's never spent longer than a few days in jail at a time, but he just doesn't <i>get</i> Sky. Doesn't get the tall blondness of him. Doesn't get how light he is on his feet when others with that same heavy flesh lumbered like lame horses. Doesn't get how those hands are so skilled at the differences between men and women, like it all comes to him easy as breathing and Sky's moving steady and fast while Nathan's still stuck on the hardness of thighs around him that are definitely not Adelaide's. 

Nathan doesn't get Sky, and he never will. He doesn't want to. To <i>get</i> Sky is to invite trouble again and again. He has enough problems with Sky as it is. Too many furtive movements, too many times Sky's deliberately raised the risks until getting caught is just a waiting game. Too many times Nathan's felt true fear, heart skittering while Sky laughed above and behind him. If anyone's to blame for his grey hairs, it's Sky. 

No matter how good the guy is, no matter how golden and how skilled his hands are, luck doesn't last forever. Luck is fickle and nasty and always comes back to kick you in the face when you're down. Luck isn't a lady, lady is a bitch let off its leash. Sky talks about luck like it's a woman, like if he seduces it hard enough with his smoothness and buttery lies, it'll be willing to stick around. Whenever Sky talks about luck, Nathan sees trouble. Nathan doesn't like trouble and he still doesn't like Sky. Never will. He gets his cut and he gets Adelaide and that's fine by him. Anything else is just asking for it.


<strong>iii.</strong>
The second, fourth, eighth time are all unmemorable, just pervasive Nathan-smell and Nathan-voice in his head, the prickliness of him. The ninth starts after Sky's done, still shuddering against Nathan's chest, legs splayed out and offering his cock like it's a gift. Nathan's not one to look into the horse's mouth, taking it and milking Sky for all it was worth and then some. The ninth starts when Nathan shoves him away, pushes him headfirst into the scratchy floral bedspread and Sky lands on his hands and elbows, Nathan following after him with something like rage in the pressure of his fingertips, searching out something Sky doesn't have. He doesn't try to give it, just offers what he has, laughing and his back bowing to accomodate Nathan above him. He's just a little taller than Nathan, a little broader, and he has to bend into the bed for Nathan's cock to press as deep as he likes it. 

Sky knows well Nathan's penchant for talk while he's doing it with Adelaide, tells her everything she's doing, everything he's thinking about her, and he's <i>loud</i>. The things he says have entertained Sky through many a long ramble from one or the other down-on-his-luck gambler. But he doesn't talk to Sky at all, says nothing at all like talking dirty to Sky will say out loud everything Nathan doesn't want to think about, like why they're doing this or why he keeps coming back. Sky talks to Nathan instead, tells him about his daddy's habit of wearing different suspenders every day of the week, about the win last week, about horses that'll make the buck and ones that won't, complains about Nathan's fingers scratching up his back making all the dolls think he's been taken for a spin by some other dame, tells Nathan to do it <i>just like that</i>. It's hard when his face is buried in the bedspread and Nathan's into his personal rhythm that's just a little too off-kilter for Sky to really like, but he manages.

He thinks he'd prefer a wall, or being bent over the warm hood of a car, just so he's not breathing dust and sucking air through fabric that looks like it's left over from the Depression. He tells Nathan as much, delights in Nathan's surprised huff into his neck. But it's less about that and more the feel of the slick lacquer against his bare front, bricks bruising his cheek, the lack of tenderness in something that's always been more about power, what Sky can get and what Nathan can give because he can't do anything but.  Beds are too intimate, too personal, too much like what Adelaide wants from Nathan when he knows that the only reason Nathan touches him is Sky doesn't want, he <i>gets</i>. He tells Nathan that the next time they get a room, they'll be on the floor and he'd better have carpet burn by the time they're finished. That gets him a snort, a muttered 'what're the odds of that?' and a hard push that makes Sky keen for more of the same. 

Nathan never used to think that there'd ever be a next time and Sky would always tell him different, but he's cracking now, giving in to the smooth flow of inevitablity that is Sky. It's less satisfying that in should be, and that's why he remembers the ninth time in all of everything they'd done. Of all the things he thought he'd get, he never expected disappointment. 

Still, it figures. Nobody, not even Nathan Detroit, held out against Sky Masterson for long.


<strong>iv.</strong> 
Nathan loves Adelaide. Everyone and their cronies knows that Nathan Detroit loves Adelaide. They also know that Nathan will never marry Adelaide until somebody pushes him, and none of them are friend enough to do that. Not that it matters. Adelaide is pushy enough by herself without anybody else barging in, and Nathan knows that's mostly his fault. His fault for giving in to Sky in the first place. His fault for not being the man Adelaide thought she was. Hell, she thought he was made of gold and was the kind of guy could have cards with <i>Factory Inspector</i> written on, the latest idea Adelaide's had stuck in her head. 

He knows that Sky would've laughed at that one if he could've. Did, later. Laughed and pointed out nicer than any man should, 'who does she think you are?' Nathan didn't have an answer for that then and he doesn't now. Not with Sky pressed up against him, eyes gleaming in the half-light, smile brighter than it had any right to be. Sky makes Nathan feel small and stupid with his airs and graces and it's not any different now, hemmed in by Sky's knees either side of his and his heavy body on Nathan's making it hard to breathe anything but the cigar smoke from Sky's mouth. 

Adelaide is the safe option, a woman he loves like his mother and fucks without reservation like she's any other doll.  Sky is something else altogether, thirty years of luck and a life that's smoothed out any tells of what Sky really thinks or feels. Sky is not the safe option. Sky is trouble and a devil constantly resting a hand in the small of Nathan's back, casting a shadow that swallows Nathan up and hasn't let go yet. Sky is a handsome man, much too handsome for Nathan to do anything but arch upwards, try to meet Sky's eyes dead on even as his body does a fine job of telling anybody listening in exactly how much he wants it. If anyone sees, they will be dead before their bodies hit the ground. Sky's always liked that part of what they do way more than he ought to, considering the dead part of the equation, but Sky's always been a bit twisted even by gambling standards.

Sky's teeth shine in the streetlight and Nathan feels his gelled hair plaster itself to brick. Something touches the back of his neck and he flinches before realising that it's just Sky's cold thumb catching under his collar. If Nathan had been trying to get away in the first place, it was a lost cause now with those huge hands so close to his jugular. 'Whaddya want, Sky? I've got a craps game floating without me.' 

'I've got a dick with your name on it,' Sky breathes, and snorts at his disbelief. Nathan can see the smoke-glaze on Sky's eyes, the beginnings of a cold in the stuffiness of his voice. He hopes he doesn't catch it. 'Isn't it terrible? Someone tried that one on me the other day.' Sky's always had this way of shifting focus in a that tilted the world off keel, pleasant and superior one moment and in the next switching to a stare that tripped Nathan's panic alarm and descended in a direct line to Nathan's cock. Then he uses <i>that</i> voice, the one that puts dolls on their knees and lures in money like bait on a line, deep and husky and intense, like right now they are the only two people in the world who understand this particular cosmic joke, and it warms Nathan all over in ways it strictly shouldn't. 'Does it work for you, Detroit?' 

'Maybe,' Nathan attempts. 

'No,' Sky concludes like it's obvious and Nathan is four years old for not getting it. He's back to feeling small and stupid all over again and this is why he does not like Sky Masterson. The bastard is a first-class heel and Nathan wants nothing to do with him. '<i>I</i> work for you.' That same voice, and his cock's jumping in his pants and this is also why he doesn't like Sky at all. 'Not literally,' he adds, lips on his adam's apple. Nathan feels teeth. 'I'd never work for you.' Pause, in which Nathan's legs have turned to jelly at the first touch of that broad hand on his cock. 'Unless you paid me. Would you pay me to do this?' 

Nathan knows the answer to this one even as he lifts up on his toes to get away from Sky's cold fingers. 'No.' 

This way he can feel Sky's smile, broad above his collar, even if he can't see it. His shoulders are damp from the bricks. It's an ungodly hour of the morning but there's still another five rounds of craps to play, a few more thousand dollars for his share, and he really shouldn't be out here while they're inside waiting on the two of them to make up their minds. It was a fight that Sky picked just because he could, and now Nathan knows exactly why. He wanted Nathan pinned down like this, squirming and trying not to. He wanted to prove his point again the same way he's been proving it for twelve years. It's been proven. Nathan gets it. He's cold and he's getting damp spots on the back of his shirtsleeves. He wants to go inside where it's warm and watch people shoot crap and make him money while they're doing it. 

But instead of that, he finds his hands curling around Sky's elbows, first two fingers finding that soft spot just above the bone. The hand down his front goes still and he can feel Sky's endless patience kicking in, waiting with a stillness that's just downright uncanny. Nathan knows the game. This is his chance to back out. Sky will give him ten seconds, no more, no less, before he gets into the business part of jerking him off. 

'Stop it, Sky. I wanna go catch some fish before Principal Harris shoots me.' Sky withdraws, still wearing that damned smile like he knows exactly know how much that cost Nathan to say, right down to the tenner. Nathan sets to tucking and adjusting and by the time he looks up again, Sky's still standing a little too close, looking up at the sky above them, smoke and fog and light from Times Square. Nathan never gets why Sky spends so much time looking up at nothing. Sky once told him about a field in Kansas where he could look up and see stars all around from one horizon to the other. It's explanation enough that Nathan doesn't ask why he does things like that knowing full well that there's nothing to see in New York.

When they go back in, everybody's set up something of a game of Russian Roulette and nobody looks twice at the two of them. Nathan moves in to break it up, Sky making them think twice about continuing with a flash of teeth and some jibe that settles them back into shooting crap. It's times like this that he's grateful for having Sky around, even if the man makes the craziest bets anyone ever saw. His luck is still willing and on his side, raking in the last of what cash Nathan hasn't marked for his own. They'd mind if it was anybody other than Sky, and while they're not inclined to invite him home for dinner, there aren't any knives in the hands that slap Sky's back as they all leave to camp out in their grotty beds. 

He doesn't see Sky after that, not until he rolls back in town two years later and Nathan bets him over some stupid mission doll when all he really wants to do is scream at Sky for leaving him behind without a damned word. But it's not like that, they weren't like that, and Sky did whatever he damned well pleased to do, so Nathan sucked it up and settled for a half-dozen barbs that sounded like he was being friendly to anyone that didn't know the two of them, touching and refusing to touch back when Sky's knees nudged his. Sky answers all of it with a punishing fuck in Mindy's restrooms, fingers blunt on Nathan's hips, growling into his ear, 'I had a thousand dolls and with every one I thought of you,' and pushing him away without another word. 

The blood in Nathan's mouth tastes a lot like forgiveness.   
 

<strong>v.</strong>
His daddy always said a lot of useful things, advice that made so much damn sense it was like a slap in the face for Sky, who'd always been just a little off in the clouds, not quite with the rest of the world. Who still marched his own tune most of the time, a tune that went along the lines of dolls, gambling, cash, dolls, gambling, dolls, cash, cash, dolls, gambling. Wherever he goes, there's someone willing to bet against Sky Masterson, because Sky Masterson is known for being crazy with his bets, is known for his luck, and everyone wants to see the golden boy with his silver tongue fall from grace, is willing to put in a bit of cash to make it happen. 

Sky Masterson has lost three bets in his entire life, and most of those were against himself. No betting man goes without playing himself a hundred dozen times over, Sky more than most. it's how gamblers function, telling themselves that they'll win this or that for this, if they do this then they'll get that back, another form of idealism that Sky doesn't have much use for. He plays himself because the strongest opponent is himself, and the day he beats himself is the day his luck is done.

The moment that he admits a lost bet to Nathan Detroit, even if he technically didn't, is one of the best and worst and oddly unmemorable of his life, the two of them tucked into a pipe heading off the main sewer chamber where they'd played, the others already above ground. He'd asked Sarah what she took herself for when she asked if he'd truly won all of the bet, and now Nathan has that same look on his face, is asking the same damned thing, what he took <i>himself</i> and Nathan for. Sky can't find anything to say for a few moments. That's all the tell Nathan needs to get up close and personal, eyes wide like maybe Sky'll open up if he tries to be intimidating enough. 

'I lost the bet,' Sky repeats, twists the knife sticking out of his own chest a little further. 'I didn't take her to Havana.' Nathan's face would be funny if he didn't feel like a grade-A asshole, and he blames his daddy's advice for finally sticking in his head long enough to give him some kind of a conscience to weigh things against. He did just fine without, and these new sensations are eating him in a way he's not really comfortable with. His trademark smile feels wrong on his face when he tries it out, and of course Nathan notices, the man ain't exactly blind no matter what he says about books being some kind of plague. 

'You sure about that?' Nathan, bless his godforsaken interfering heart, is looking at him exactly like his daddy used to do when Sky made crap up on the fly and winged it past him even knowing it didn't cut it. He's giving Sky a chance to make good his name, except that that means tarnishing Sarah's, and if this was what love felt like, he didn't want it. Luck had been his woman and cash his grease and dolls his hobby, and he wasn't sure how that was all going to fit into Sarah's pixie-faced determination to <i>save</i> him, like she sincerely believed she could. He just as sincerely believed that she couldn't, that there was no soul left saving, just a guy with the ethics of a dead man with more selfishness than actual sense and the taste of cock in his mouth, rising like it did too often these days. 

'I'm sure.' 

He hands over the grand then with enough of a handle on his smile that Nathan looks less suspicious now and more shell-shocked, like he can't believe it. Sky can't really believe he's doing it either. Damned dolls. It's done, though, and Nathan closes up like he knows what else Sky means even though he's pretty sure Nathan couldn't have any idea about Sarah and Havana and the whole fiasco. 

It's probably obvious to somebody that knows him as well as Nathan, even if Nathan denies knowing anything more than the shift of Sky's body to his moods, nothing more than the look on Sky's face when he came deep and hard like he'd never get the chance again. It's still more than anyone else really knows of him. Sky wonders if that'll change, if Sarah will get to know everything about him and he doesn't think so. He and Nathan aren't husbands or people, they're <i>gamblers</i> at levels too deep to name. Their wives would never even come close to the thrill of large amounts of money loaded with stakes and expectations and the whims of Lady Luck whom they'd loved and bedded for going on fifteen years now, and that wasn't something liable to change. 

'Tell the truth, Sky,' Nathan says, and Sky's not going get the chance to let his lie set in stone, seems like. 'Come on.' 

'Just take it.' 

'I did,' Nathan counters, stubborn like he's fighting for something and Sky has no idea what for or why. He doesn't like that he doesn't know, can't even begin to puzzle out the way Nathan's face is working itself into knots. 'Now you gotta tell me why.'  

He's silent for a while, working out what'll fly and what won't, until he decides that he's just too tired for it and tells Nathan the truth for the last and second time ever, an old pipe shaking against his back, Nathan curved into the other side of the small tunnel, face close enough to Sky's that he can taste Nathan's sour exhaustion, toes of their shoes touching by accident. 

'The doll got me.'  Sky accompanies it with a shrug and a smile, a rueful thing that suggests that the sky just fell, how about that? Nathan doesn't buy it for a moment, until he <i>does</i>. Now he's really looking at Sky like he's grown a second head. 

'A mission doll caught Sky Masterson?' 

Sky grimaces agreement. It sounds even more ridiculous out loud than it did in his head. 

'A mission doll,' Nathan says slowly, like it'll stick if he says it enough. 'A mission doll caught Sky Masterson.' His eyes flicker up at Sky, they've been caught on the stains on Sky's knees from when he dropped the second the others had left to wake Nathan up in the only way he knew how, and Nathan's always been too much of a coward for his own good and too damned predictable by half. He starts to say something he'll never be able to take back, and Sky cuts him off. 

'Don't,' Sky says, like it could ever break the flow of the hundred thousand things they never said for any one of a hundred thousand reasons that didn't matter now but were still saying with every breath. 'Just don't.' 

'Drop dead,' Nathan tells him, folding out of the game between them with easy resigned grace, able to roll whichever way the dice fell even if it hurt like a bitch. 

Sky half-wishes he could do just that, but he's too stubborn by half and the games always go on, mission doll brides or not. 

He'll be seeing Nathan at another game someday soon, and he'll be playing with the same smile and the same silver tongue and the same golden charm that Nathan won't be able to keep his hands away from. They'll fuck, Lady Luck whispering into their ears and keeping them safe and undiscovered and sound, and then they'll go back to how things should have always been. Nathan doesn't like Sky, and Sky sure as hell doesn't see the point of liking Nathan, but it's gotten where they're not much use with knowing the other one's out there somewhere, being the same selfish gambling bastard as ever. 

They rely on each other not to change, and that's a future Sky can live with, it's not as bad as all that, Sarah on one arm and Nathan half a step behind him with his cut in his hands, loaded dice in both their pockets. It sounds good to him, and like his daddy told him, he'll take whatever he can get and then some. He's not had a chance to beat the devil at his own game yet, even if the devil is himself, and he won't be done until then. 

Sky kisses Nathan's jaw, lingers for a moment, hands either side of Nathan's shoulders, knuckles cold against the damp concrete. He smells Brylcreme and stale flowers, tastes sweat and something that's probably sewer residue, feels the scratch of Nathan's stubble and cheap suits making his lips tingle. He senses the guilt and softness and half-hearted moral relativism that Nathan carried from the start, the abstract indefinable things that made Nathan as familiar to Sky as his own heartbeat.

Sky allows all of this to seep into his memory, preserved for another time, and lets Nathan go.  


<strong>vi.</strong>
For the record, Nathan Detroit still doesn't like Sky Masterson. 

But sometimes he sees him around. Sometimes they get a hotel room and walk up into bed for old time's sake or no reason at all. Sometimes Sky's voice is in his ear just as he's drifting off to sleep even though Nathan's certain that Sky's nowhere near New York right at that moment. Sometimes the sky is blue, and sometimes Sky smiles that old smile that's got worn down with time and Sarah but is still familiar. Sometimes Sky tips his hat to Nathan in the street as he passes by without speaking, grown quiet with age. 

Sometimes Nathan tells the story of a dozen gamblers bet against their souls, same way as he's told it a thousand times, set in legend. 

Sometimes it's worth it to invite trouble to his door, even if trouble is six feet tall and golden with a slippery silver tongue and the devil's own luck. 

Not always. But sometimes.

<lj-cut text=""Nobuta wo Produce, Bando/Nobuta, G, written for Lauren and Garland"">
Bando consideres Nobuta a liability. Nobuta is small and shy and skinny, with a back that curves and shivers away from Bando's fingernails. But her arm is very soft and the pads of her fingers tremble against the bruise on Bando's knee as they sit on the roof, Nobuta holding her cigarettes, wrapping crinkling in her hand. She doesn't watch Bando smoke, looks at dirty tops of buildings and specifically doesn't notice Bando's lack of reaction to Nobuta touching her.

Bando puts it down to being occupied with her cigarette, her nails scratching the concrete. What she doesn't say is that days later, applying makeup to cover a thumbprint on her neck, she can still feel the pressure of Nobuta's thumb on the inside of her knee. It doesn't feel like a bruise or a mark, a streak of dirt that needs to be washed off. It is more as though a part of her has been erased, exposing something cleaner that she didn't know existed. If she later scratches off the impression of Nobuta's thumb until skin tears and bleeds, she doesn't bother to mention it.

She wonders if she is frightened, and decides no. Nobuta is nothing to be afraid of. The only thing to ever be afraid of is herself.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Ace wo Nerae, Oka/Midorikawa, implied Ryuuzaki/Midorikawa, PG, written for Garland""> 
Oka looks at Midorikawa's hair lying across her stomach, ends brushing against her hands. Midorikawa directs her with fierce eyes and a steady voice, her strength increased though she is lying back, shirt open past her waist. There is never any vulnerability in Midorikawa anywhere, anytime. Oka doesn't know what to do, moves her fingers back and forth in a triangle from her hips, her fingers fitting in the hollows.

Oka looks at Midorikawa's intensity, laid open and bare before her, and wonders if Ryuuzaki has been here before, if Ryuuzaki knows what Midorikawa looks like when she is like this, girl and tennis and power combined.

When Midorikawa gasps for her to press harder, for her fingers to be wider, harsher, Oka sees the shadow of Ryuuzaki before and behind and around her, <i>Ryuuzaki was here</i> scribed into the arc of Midorikawa's throat, and feels safer. She can do this, because Ryuuzaki has. She can tell that Midorikawa is thinking the same thing. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Prince of Tennis, Tezuka/Ryoma, G, written for Garland""> Ryoma sees Tezuka every day, a tall solid shape standing inside the courts at practice. But Ryoma sees Tezuka everywhere, finds him in passerby and in trees and tennis balls. In this opponent, this opponent speaks of Tezuka, sneers at Ryoma and speaks of Tezuka and all that Ryoma sees is the cut of his hair, like Tezuka's, and vows to defeat him. He does this every day, every time he plays someone; Kaidoh with his integrity, Momo with his power, Eiji and his mood-maker abilities, Oishi and his genuine care. If he finds and defeats all the parts of Tezuka, Ryoma thinks, maybe he can defeat Tezuka himself one day. 

Maybe he can work his way through all of the little parts, increasing until he finds what is almost Tezuka himself, and then he can stand before Tezuka on a court somewhere, can stand and say <i>I have defeated you, all of you</i>. He thinks Tezuka would understand. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Prince of Tennis, Kamio/Ibu, R, written for Laura""> Shinji never shuts up, never stops mumbling, not even when he's kneeling between Kamio's legs and and has his mouth working around Kamio's cock, and this is the best thing about Shinji talking so much, talking and talking and talking all the time even with food or drinks or lollies in his mouth, is that it means he gives fantastic blowjobs. Like this one, with Kamio's pants around his knees and his belt-buckle caught under his hip, Shinji's mouth and throat working around his cock, around and up, his tongue licking and twisting around, soundless.

Kamio guesses it's probably something like <i>fucking hell yes, yes, yes like that</i>, Shinji has a dirty mouth during sex and he fires off more fucks than Kamio can muster in a month, and fuck yeah, the way his lips curl around his cock when he says fuck and and the vibration in his throat. There's no rhythm to it, but Kamio finds one, tips his head back with his hands in Shinji's hair and groans as Shinji's mumbling speeds up, throat moving and moving and never entirely still around him, and fuckyes, yes yes, he tips forwards, his hands on Shinji's shoulders and comes in Shinji's mouth.
 
Shinji, being the pro that he at talking through anything at all, just swallows and keeps going, word-swallow-word-swallow, and it's almost enough to get him hard again. Shinji lifts his head, licking off the last. '... and you're really hot when you come,' Shinji finishes, his eyes steady on Kamio's, '...and-' Kamio leans forwards, grapples, and gives Shinji the hardest kiss he can. For once, Shinji shuts up. Almost; his throat is still going, probably stuck on something like 'I love you', and Kamio doesn't bother to tell him to stop. </lj-cut>"

<lj-cut text=""When Sanada drives, he does it with the calm, focused presence of mind that seem unbroken by the radio blasting.""> When Sanada drives, he does it with the calm, focused presence of mind that seem unbroken by the radio blasting <i>I Am An Anarchist</i> at near-max volume. Rather, he screams along, using its rage and power to enter the sort of calm usually reached simply by driving at very high speeds. Sanada eases the indicator of the speedometer to two hundred and twenty kilometres per hour and spares a glance at his passenger, whose eyes are closed, his hair pressed back by the wind. 'Sanada,' he murmurs, barely audible over the twanging of electric guitars, 'pay attention.' 

Sanada shakes his head and turns his eyes back to the road, opening the throttle to two hundred and forty as he turns into a wide curve. Metallica replaces Sid Vicious, and Sanada taps his fingers on the wheel, singing quietly. 'Sanada?' Two hundred and fifty. 

'Yes?' Two hundred and sixty. The car is shuddering, groaning; it feels like a warm, throaty embrace. 

'I love you.' Two hundred and seventy. 

'I know,' he answers. Two hundred and eighty. 'Are you prepared?'

'I am.' Two hundred and ninety. 'Are you, Genichirou?' The machine is purring now, vibrating, grinding and threatening to fly apart with the force of its motion, and yet it won't; it is built for far more dangerous speeds, for mobility and two-point turns within seconds. It's almost a waste of the machine.

'Yes.' Three hundred. Metallica changes to something bouncy and classical; <i>Cuban</i>, Sanada doesn't say, and the boy next to him doesn't smile. Three hundred and ten. 

Sanada hums, changes the radio station past other stations and twists it into crackling static. A hand closes over his, holds on as Sanada adjusts the dial and pulls back to the wheel. <i>Video killed the radio star</i>, the radio croons. Three hundred and twenty. 

He doesn't blink, doesn't flinch as a casual, deliberate turn of the wheel has them driving directly into the side of the embankment at three hundred and thirty kilometres an hour.

<i>They were killed instantly</i>, the reporter blares. <i>No chance of survival at that speed. Police say that it was clearly calculated...</i>

<lj-cut text=""Sanada is woken at three in the morning by his brother sliding back the screen to his room."">

Sanada is woken at three in the morning by his brother sliding back the screen to his room, swords clanking in his hand. They have a light bout of kendo under hurricane lamps while the sky outside becomes duller, greyer towards dawn. Sanada sees his brother to his room and goes back to bed at four-thirty, waking again at six-thirty to make breakfast. 

Getting to the kitchen in the Sanada household is a matter of memory; the rooms are divided by screens, and while some walls are solid and others are not, the rooms are often remapped by his brother's varying degrees of agoraphobia. The path to the kitchen is today marked by his wife's blue-flag ikebana arrangments. Despite the changes in route, Sanada always ensures that they all lead past one of the few true paintings they have, painted by his brother's wife twenty-eight years ago. 

It is a painting of Yukimura Seiichi, as scribed along the top in scrawling kanji along the upper left corner; set some vague place, placed in Tokyo by the distinctive sky and light and fixtures  in the background, but the place itself could be any neglected tennis court in the world. The angle is awkward, as Sanada intended it; the boy, no more and no less than fourteen years old, is caught between a smile and a laugh, knowing and anticipatory, warmth and laughter and an invitation to imagine everything that could be achieved with a court and his racket in hand. Sometimes when the lights are changed in summer and they are kept awake by the heat, his wife comments that there is a waiting demon in the oilskin, powerful and old, and his brother whispers that it is the god-child of tennis. 

- 

In Sanada's first year at Rikkaidai High, Yukimura sickens and collapses, his weakness insiduous and lethal. They visit him in the hospital, the old team, but Yukimura had changed, caring about nothing aside from what he had lost, vowing to return again with bright dangerous eyes. He spoke to Sanada like he was still the Sanada Yukimura had known two years before, as if they were all still the same and it weren't obvious that Yukimura had used everything he had in fighting it the first time. Yukimura dies when the air is fresh and clear and Sanada has already decided to marry Mayumi. Yukimura dies at ten-thirty on a Sunday morning while Sanada is reading from their assignments, marking in Yukimura's answers and comparing them to his own. 

-

This morning, the painting is simply what it is, no god-child, no demon, just a master's painting of a healthy, strong, <i>alive</i> boy, and Sanada pauses for a moment in front of it, spares a thought and a prayer. Candles are lit, pale blue and smoky and that boy's favourite. Sanada notes that he will need to replace them the next day. 

It is his turn to cook breakfast, and he prepares the food his mother always made for this kind of chilly, crackling weather, listening to the house creak and shudder and wake up as he makes bento. His eldest daughter snatches her black box from the counter and burns her fingers on toast, leaving for morning training with quick puffing curses as her mother enters. 

'Morning,' his wife greets, and their daughter backsteps to kiss her mother before running out and down to the bus stop. ""Lolololololololloooooohhhhoh,"" his brother wails from across the house, and then he is there in the kitchen hanging off Sanada's arm in one of his quick bursts of lighting movement, red-rimmed and squinting at his sister-in-law.

'Genchaaaaan,' his brother slurs, half-crazed by sleep deprivation and his own intermittent genius, and Sanada directs him to the tray at the end of the low table, unpeels the clammy fingers clenching his arm. His brother sets to eating without another word, drawn and fanatical, his spare hand scribbling at notepaper with his fingernails. He leaves as soon as he has finished his bowl, springing from seiza to the door without any movement inbetween, tossing a jaunty greeting to his wife in the hallway. 

'O-bloody-hayo,' his brother's wife drawls through the door, blonde hair frizzed and earrings clinging to her neck. 'Don't suppose there's a chance of getting a hand or two today,' she says, brittle and high-voiced, and accepts tea with a lazy crook of her eyebrow, and wanders off to the backyard with a lazy salute, leaving toothmarks on the side of her cup. 

Sanada's youngest son shuffles into the kitchen, changing batteries in his hearing aid and frowning at the awkwardness of the battery in his fingers, having inherited the Sanada familial deafness his father and uncle also shared. When the battery is finally replaced in his hearing aid and the old one tossed out with tape, he signs his greetings and finishes off the rest of the food, ravenous and misanthropic while reading the morning paper, causing all of them to laugh and for Sanada to be cynical in turn, his brother's wife and himself playing off each other in a makeshift double act that had his son muttering about how uncool they were, but snickering all the same. 

Their eldest comes home then, showing off her medals and smiling brightly, waving her rackets in the air as she describes her matches in Osaka, grinning and laughing like her uncle did when he was particularly zealous, flashing brilliance and cheer, careless with her words in a way that she had not learnt from her parents, mainly directing her words at Sanada. 'She adores her father', his wife had told him once, 'and you adore her.'

'We have a definite shot at Nationals at this rate,' she carols while methodically tearing her breakfast to pieces, exhausted and chatty, 'if they went that badly in a practice match while were missing half our team 'cause of some bug - did you hear about that, it was awful, like most of the team came down it and remember when I was throwing up on the phone, but not on the phone, in the phone, and like we were all sick and stuff and then a bunch of us got better and we did this whole thing with their team, right, and they were so cool, remember when I told you about that move their singles three had, dad, remember? and he played against me and I won! I broke the move! It was kind of hard, but like you said, if I did the centering thing, if I did the patience thing, and I watched like you told me...' 

She talks to him for an hour, through his brother's wife cleaning up breakfast and his shower, sitting on the toilet seat and picking out his suit for him when he dresses, gesturing when her words are too fast-paced to be clear. He drives her to school on his way to work and they debate argument and rhetoric, trading bad puns and semi-serious points. His daughter argues well and logically, as he taught her; she is equally as handy with a hammer as she is with a needle, fluent and joyful and it is her that he takes the most pride in. He thinks, as she bounces - not walks, bounces - out of the car, that she looks so very much like her mother. She looks so very much like Yukimura. 

-

Sanada first met his wife at a dinner party when he was fifteen and Yukimura had only just recovered from his illness. His father had informed him that he and his brother were yet again be victims of their mothers continual matchmaking. This particular dinner party, he had been surprised by his mother's choice. Her name was Kazuki Mayumi. and she was beautiful and delicate and looked so similiar to Yukimura that he felt dizzy. But her eyes, for all their shape, were not blue but green, and her hair was long enough to brush against his hand when they danced. 

Through the evening, it became clear that she was nothing like Yukimura, and it became clearer as time flowed past that this was a good thing. Mayumi got on excellently with his brother, with his brother's girlfriend, pleased his mother and commiserated with his father, was polite and graceful enough for his grandfather to grunt approvingly. 

Mayumi and Sanada discussed a tentative engagement while he was in his last year of high school and she in her second, and agreed upon it when he was in his first year of university. They married in autumn of his second year, bore twins within seven months, and settled into a life they were both already familiar with. 

Sanada is one of the few who remember that Yukimura died in the autumn, but Mayumi is also one of those few, and if she is puzzled at Sanada's choice of an autumn wedding, she does not comment. 

-

Sanada does not love Mayumi. Mayumi does not love Sanada. They are merely close, fine friends, eternal good acquaintances in their similar tastes and eminent suitability. Sanada's mother has said, more than once, that she knew herself well, women better, and her son more than anyone else. 

'You have had the great love, you keep it, and it does you no good,' she tells him over tea when he is nineteen and he has married Mayumi three months before. They are having rosehip tea over the goban she keeps on the porch attached to her wing of the house, both of them holding perfect seiza as they played. His mother is far better in go than he is; it has to do with the depth of her ability to read moves, her uncanny ability to know what he is thinking. 'It is time for peace, Genichirou.' 

-

Renji has asked, before, how Sanada can bear the fact that he still misses Yukimura, that Yukimura is dug into Sanada's mind and will most likely never go, that (despite it being twenty-eight years since) he still loves Yukimura; and that, with this, he has a stable, comfortable marriage with Mayumi and their children. Renji asks how, and means why. 

If Sanada answered, which he never yet has - he would say that he has had 'Yukimura Seiichi' hammered into his mind as a basic fact of the person that is Sanada Genichirou for so long that to love Yukimura is like kendo, like shogi, like the smell of his wife's shampoo in the mornings. He loves Yukimura, and that is the end of it. In a way, he loves his wife. There is no question that he loves his children, his brother, his life. 

There are gaps, of course, gaps shaped like Yukimura and tennis and the kind of real, overwhelming happiness he'd felt before Yukimura left him for the last time, but as his brother tells him over beer in the backyard, resting after ten months of double-PhD insanity, 'life is remembering what's missing and what's gone and what coulda been, right?' 

If even now he looks at Yukimura's portrait every morning with more longing than he should strictly have, Mayumi will say nothing. If he listens to his daughter's eager discussions of her tennis club activities with more than fatherly interest, she will call him uncool but avoid asking why. If he clings too tightly to his brother when they are drunk and lonely and pathetic, his brother will grumble, but won't force Sanada to let go. 

-

Sanada is content most of the time. He isn't overwhelmingly happy, nor is his sadness crushing, and somehow, he's now calm enough to accept that. His grandfather plays shogi with him and observes him critically, says 'well done, lad' at the end of the game, and Sanada can accept it for what it is, rather than take offense at what it is not. 'Your life suits me more, grandfather', he says as thanks. 

Yukimura would object to that, of course, but Yukimura is long gone, and these days, Sanada is the only one who remembers him.

"event","This is for <lj user=sparklespiff>, because she asked for a drabble to relieve the burn of badfics. This is also bad, but it is a better kind of bad, I guess. 

<lj-cut text="""">
Akutsu and Dan aren't the usual kind of neighbourhood all-day nursery, but Akutsu's at home most of the day and Dan's there for the rest and sometimes it's both of them, and though the parents disapprove of Akutsu in loud voices and they wonder about Dan's tolerance of Akutsu's filthy mouth, the children somehow really, really love being at the Dan-Akutsu place. There's a core group of children, five or six kids, that run in and out of the house without a goddamn by-your-leave and they break furniture and screech and make Akutsu-san teach them fun ways to learn their homework, but they're decent kids, just a bit haywire. 

Dan makes bread every Tuesday morning and that's when they're their calmest, because Dan-san is like that, cheerful and happy and calmer than a blank wall. They all know that it's from years of enduring Akutsu's grumpy mornings, but even Akutsu-san calms down with the smell of baking bread and if he's smoked a few cigarettes already, he can be easily persuaded into going into the front yard, stretching out on the concrete and telling great stories that last all morning, drawing a crowd of people to listen to his loud rumbling orator's voice. Even if some of the parents disapprove later, mutter about the nicotine stains on Akutsu's fingers and his habitual curse on every third word, they all pause on the street to hear snippets, and in a way, they're glad for him to be there, despite all of his shortcomings. 

Akutsu-san seems completely unaware that he's a walking community service, that he's an odd-jobs man and babysitter and counsellor and nurse and coach all in one, and that on top of the rest he is almost singlehandedly responsible for keeping the crime rate in an area of some fifteen blocks almost nonexistent. When they ask Dan-san how Akutsu can not notice that he's respected by almost everyone for some classic feat of inteligence and strength, that if Akutsu-san bothered to change a few of his nastier features he would be the most welcome man in every house, Dan-san smiles and tells them that Akutsu-san has always been that way. 

It doesn't change the fact that the benefits of Akutsu-san's presence almost outweigh the negatives, that when their children come home babbling excitedly about today's Cool Thing Akutsu Did and show renewed interest in life, it balances evenly against Akutsu-san's terrible habits of littering the paths with cigarette butts and smashing beer bottles against the wall of his house at four in the morning for no good reason. 

Everyone eventually comes to several realisations about Akutsu and Dan, formed independently: one, that Akutsu is horrible to have as a visitor but excellent as a long-term neighbour, two, that Dan is in fact the scarier one of the two of them, and three, that Dan and Akutsu are bound together as the most lovey-dovey couple in the universe. 

All of this means that, over time, several generations of children are brought up half in their homes and half in the Dan-Akutsu house, and that over time, when Akutsu is forty and doesn't show any sign of mellowing, the neighbourhood is quite firmly infamous for Akutsu and Dan, Dan's fundraisers and organisation of the local school sports teams, for Akutsu's irritable growl yelling at the local kids to shut the fuck up and get to school aready. 

They're fixtures, and when the senior councilmen bother to get past Akutsu's language and his aggressiveness, they find a brilliant civic mind, full of idle suggestions that in fact make much more sense that anything they could come up with, and by Akutsu's fiftieth year, crankier and moodier and as agile as ever, he is the head councilman, accepting the position with a resigned sigh and sharp-eyed intelligence. 

Sometimes Akutsu looks back on his life, sitting in a tree in the garden with a beer in hand, and thinks that it could have all gone so horribly wrong, thinks about the divergences that he can pinpoint in hindsight, moments that led to this life of other people's children in his house and other people's wellbeing in his hands and Dan, always Dan, with him. He can still see alternative futures, alternative paths where he and Dan are the kind of fucked, twisted life he'd immediately seen and feared from the beginning, paths where he is a drunkard and Dan is a whore and they live in some shitty tenenment flat and they are so drugged and Dan is his whiny, needy child and Akutsu himself is a monster, deserving to be shot on sight. But that is not the path they took, things are different, and that life isn't theirs, but someone else's, something that never came to pass.  

There is no point in thinking about the way things could have been, so Akutsu finishes his beer and goes inside to make sure that the latest batch of monsters haven't destroyed anything that can't be replaced, and after that, he kisses Dan in the corridor, thankful in ways Dan will never understand.

<lj-cut text=""Genichirou and his brother have always been close"">


Genichirou and his brother have always been close. They're almost polar opposites in personality, despite looking very much alike, and when he was four Genichirou imagined that he'd been left on the doorstep and that the Sanadas had adopted him, but his brother had told him to stop being stupid and just use his difference to stand out from the rest of them. 

His family is almost all like his brother; his grandfather, while stern, laughs as often as he backhands his students when they make mistakes, and his father is jolly, with a face that seems made to smile. His mother, on the other hand, is graceful and effortless and cold, and Genichirou shares a particular understanding with her, duty and tradition and appearances, and it is the both of them that preserve the dignity of the family name. It is their mother who pronounces Genichirou's brother a disappointment and gives Genichirou the name meant for the eldest son. Genichirou has never heard what his brother's opinion was of that; he only knows that his brother refuses to call Genichirou by his full name, preferring Gen and Gen-chan, and that their mother and his brother clash often, his brothers' arguments loud and complicated while his mother argues with soft, clipped words and a single, imperative reason. 

It is his brother that teachs Genichirou kendo, it is his brother that first leads Genichirou to pick up a racket, it is his brother that teaches him shogi and plays him regularly on the verandah, stretched out and smiling, but intensely focused. It is also his brother that teaches Genichirou that sometimes people simply cannot coexist, it is his brother that teaches Genichirou the true meaning of a punch, it is his brother that informs Genichirou that if Genichirou wants to be good at anything, he has to be something. 

They were given seperate rooms almost from the start, but there are things they like and dislike about each other's rooms and wandering back and forth and shouting in the hallway made their parents irritable, so one or the other migrates across the hall sometime during the morning and spends the day there, amongst Genichirou's layered, precise clutter and in his brother's random, freewheeling chaos, Genichirou's laptop on the floor of his brother's room as often as his brother's textbooks find their way to the table in Genichirou's. 

It's an arrangement they have, to share rooms and lives and for them to drive each other crazy until they shout and stamp their feet and end up breaking out the shogi board or having a kendo match until they declare a truce. They never play tennis; that is Genichirou's alone, and they never play basketball; that is his brother's. They have both tennis and basketball courts on their land, and they invite their respective teams over for matches, but they never mix, because they both understand that they need something without the other. 

His brother still sometimes comes to his matches in his Rikkaidai uniform and steals one of Genichirou's caps and causes chaos that Genichirou has to later fix, and sometimes Genichirou might be seen in the stands at his brother's more important games, but that is as far as it goes. 

They share almost everything in their lives, and it shows in how they share clothes and rooms and beds, how they sometimes have the exact same thought, how they can both alternately infuriate and calm the other precisely as they want to, shows in how they expect the other to balance them; when together, they are the perfect mix of stoicsm and extroversion, deadpan humour and wild overacting, and they conclude each other's thoughts. Genichirou misses his brother at school, misses him when he pauses and expects his brother to leap in and add something that will put the right meaning to what he says, and his brother expects Genichirou to have a deadpan comment and prompt him into some action or movement. 

The thing they don't share, though, is his brother's girlfriends, and Genichirou never introduces his brother to Yukimura. Genichirou and his brother share taste in women and partners, share a similar taste for beauty, although Genichirou's runs to the simplistic and his brother's to the overdone. The first time his brother brings a  girl home, introduces her, it starts a familiar progression, a series of events repeated over and over: <i>you can't possibly be brothers</i>, accompanied by a laugh, <i>you're so different</i>, and his brother cracks a joke and Genichirou contradicts him out of habit, When the girl has gotten used to their absolute difference, Genichirou will do something that matches his brother in senseless idiocy, and his brother will have a few moments of serious, purposeful insight, and she will reel, <i>hahaha, you're not as different as I thought</i>, and smile uneasily and they will be their comforting opposites again, but there are always those few moments where they forget the diference and become each other. 

His brother has eternal good taste in women, prefers girls that are pretty and annoyingly intelligent with bad habits that drive them both up the wall, girls that crack obscure jokes and go on enthusiastically at length about this or that, and sometimes he prefers girls that are beautiful and graceful and cynical, bitten and twice as strong with bad humour and narrow points of view, and often a mix of both, and Genichirou likes each one. His brother prefers foreign women, prefers their mysterious culture and weird food and rituals, and while Genichirou expresses a preference for the Japanese, Genichirou finds as much amusement as his brother does in learning new things about countries they will never visit. 

The latest girlfriend is a girl named Jen, an exchange student from Australia that has a habit of stealing water pressure and leaving tampons loose in the bathroom, a girl that is pretty and appreciates Genichirou's waffle skills, has noisy arguments with his brother over nothing and stamps off to complain at Genichirou until she rocks back and waves off her irritation with some other overriding fact to be annoyed about to his brother as an apology. She's almost as tall as Genichirou, blonde and brown-eyed and with the most flexible face Genichirou has ever seen. Genichirou likes her, and knows his brother likes her too; knows that this one is a keeper, as she taught them in translation. 

He also knows that she will leave them to their comfortable two-person closeness, will leave them to share affection with others but that at the end of it all, their own beds are the ones they tumble into, that his brother will always watch bad porn on Genichirou's laptop and tickle him until Genichirou is curled red-faced on the floor, that they will wrap around each other in sleep and stick their hair up each other's noses and snort at each other when they are too much like the cutouts they are supposed to be. 

There's not much else they can do, in point of fact; Genichirou's defining attribute to others is his formality, his stubbornness and lack of humour, and his brother's is his casual, almost rude behaviour, his changeable opinions and his constant lookout for opportunity, whether it be for stories or mockery. Their attributes to each other are older brother-younger brother, and when they both get too much like the single dimension most people see of them, they ridicule each other and ground each other. 

Genichirou sometimes thinks, in the face of Yukimura's illness, that his unyielding will is running away from him, that there's not much else he can remember otherwise than <i>always win</i>, and then his brother beats him at shogi and inspires him to deadpan comedy that has his family rolling in stitches, and he feels himself again. 

He does the same for his brother when his brother becomes too irresponsible, too free and easy with others to have any value in himself, and at these times Genichirou pushes and shoves and compiles chore rosters that his brother complains about but always does, assigns harsh consequences to his brother's actions until his brother comes to his senses and takes pride in the little things. 

Genichirou's mother taught him the value of housework in centering one's place in life; his father taught him humour. His brother's given him everything else, and despite the way they annoy and push at each other, they agree on so many things that it seems ridiculous to fight for extended lengths of time. It's his brother that he has his first fight with, it's his brother that teaches him to kiss properly, it's his brother that he sleeps with and fucks on a Saturday afternoon after they've had a long day's practice at the dojo, limbs warm and stretched and lazy. 

They've never really bothered to hide their actions from his brother's girlfriends; his brother, being a handsome man, has his pick of women and whatever else they are, his girlfriends are warped in ways that allow them to see the humour in it, ways that lets them raise their eyebrows and shrug it off as something they just did; often this is how his brother meets them, discussing insane theories with hypothetical answers that took hours to construct, question and answer blurring the edges of morality and decency. The women often take it as a golden opportunity to observe a living sociological experiment, watching them interact with comfortable ease under the scrutiny, brothers and closer than brothers, the perfect example of positive incest, as one called in, and they had simultaneously made the same wry comment: We are not perfect, we are family. 

Jen, in particular, hasn't bothered to mind; she takes it as something that's natural to them and leaves it at that. She was intelligent and perceptive, and Genichirou knew she had suspected something about them from the start, from the way her eyes flickered over their closeness when his brother introduced her and spent the time pressed full-length against Genichirou's back, from how Genichirou did his homework lying alongside his brother on one of their futons, their legs tangled together, from how they never avoided contact with each other, preferred it, kicking each other under the table, his brother's arm propped along Genichirou's back while he read. 

When she walks in on them, his brother bent backwards over the side of the bed kissing Genichirou upide down in between bursts of laughter, she frowns and demands a kiss for herself. She later tells them that they were obvious and she treats both of them as her boyfriends, free and easy like it doesn't particular matter to her which brother it is. They kiss sometimes, a triangle of three, and then they roll apart and while Genichirou appreciates her prettiness, her freckles and long hair, his brother and Yukimura turn him on more and she doesn't push it. 

He and his brother have a lot of sex, all things considered, and Genichirou isn't surprised when Yukimura is immediately suspicious about Genichirou's hitherto unknown talents, isn't surprised when Yukimura assumes there must be girls, must be someone, but Yukimura is easily jealous and Genichirou placates him. His brother doesn't count as anyone; his brother is his brother, but Yukimura will never know this, and so he and his brother don't fuck while Yukimura is around. 

Yukimura's enforced hospital stay is a blessing for both of them in some ways and it makes it harder in others; Genichirou is tenser while Yukimura's life teeters, tenser and harder to please and sex ends up rough, his brother pinning him  against the wall, on top of the table, anywhere. Jen complains about the bites on his brother's body and his brother shrugs and hugs Genichirou, knocking his cap off his head and tugging him to stand against him, smiles and laughs while Genichirou is calmed by the arms around his shoulders. 

Kantou finals are a blessing and a release for Genichirou, and the sex is long and slow and comfortable, Genichirou deadpanning afterwards while his brother sits up and tries to suffocate him with the pillow. 

His brother occupies himself the next day with stealing all of his hats and forcing Genichirou to make his hair easily accessible to his brother, who likes to flick it into Genichirou's eyes and use the opportunity to tease him while he's doing his summer homework. In the end, they have sex again in the garden while their parents are out and no-one is around and Genichirou finds himself caring less and less that he broke his promise to Yukimura, finds that he is calmer and that he smiles more, even just to his brother, who gets almost all of his smiles anyway. 

The summer heat forces all of the doors open to catch the breeze and they lie together under the revolving fan, talking about insignificant brotherly things, fingers poking at each other's shoulders in the lead up to an argument they can't sustain, it's just too hot, and so they make out for an hour instead. This is how, if anything, Genichirou pictures his life. He knows that there will be men and women for them both, wives and affairs and divorces and children, but they will always be together whenever they can, together and touching and knowing each other better than they would ever bother to know anyone else. 

Syuusuke and Yuuta Fuji confuse Genichirou; in theory he understands the awkwardness in their dynamic, but he can see the balance needed, the ways to achieve that balance, and he finds that watching Fuji and his brother is nothing short of frustrating. He tells this to his brother over the goban in Genichirou's room, doors to the porch wide open, letting in the breeze and rattling the stones, and his brother plays tsuke and stirs his stones, shifts a handful of them back and forth. 

''They're not like us,' his brother says. 'We're meant to be guilty for what we do, and we aren't.' Genichirou responds with a low pincer, and his brother snorts and shakes his head, demolishes the right side of the board with a skillful move. 'This is who we are, really. We're together, however that works, and that's the end of it. But those guys, they drag things out, make them more complicated, and they don't have to be. Actually, I think we're just fucked up, but whatever,' and his brother laughs and flicks a stone into Genichirou's face, takes the opportunity of Genchirou's momentary surprise to wrestle him to the floor and kiss his throat, his stomach, tickle the sensitive spot on the inside of his thigh, and Genichirou guides his tongue and moans quietly, spilled stones digging into his back. 

Sex with Yukimura after Yukimura has left the hospital is strange and awkward. Yukimura's body still doesn't quite remember its full functionality, and though they were as close together as it was possible to be many times in the hospital, in comparison Genichirou has heightened the skill of his hands and mouth and it is Genichirou teaching Yukimura the range and feeling in his body many, many times over. It's a situation that frustrates Yukimura and sometimes when Genichirou wakes in the mid-morning after he and Yukimura have been busy all night, Yukimura is standing in the kitchen watching his brother make breakfast with a contemplative, distant expression that Genichirou has learnt to fear. 

'Yukimura's working it out,' his brother mutters at lunchtime one day, some undefined time after they won Nationals and the autumn was crisp and clear, 'you won't be able to keep him quiet much longer,' and Genichirou nods, picks at his food, ignores his brother's loud sigh. 

The situation with Yukimura explodes when Yukimura comes by unannounced late at night and finds Genichirou and his brother naked and curled around each other in bed, it being too hot to sleep in clothes but too cold to sleep without each other, and Genichirou is shaken awake and pinned by angry blue eyes. 

'Seiichi,' is all Genichirou says, clear and calm, and Genichirou's brother doesn't wake up when Genichirou untangles himself and Yukimura drags him into the bathroom and closes the door, mouth a thin straight line. 'I knew it,' Yukimura says. 'There had to be something wrong with you. Nobody can ever be that good the goddamn first time,' and there are fat, warm tears splashing onto Genichirou's hands. 'You've been lying to me.'

'My brother and I have nothing to do with you,' Genichirou says, and for all the practice he's given this speech, his voice is still wobbling. 'You are always going to share me with my brother, and that is how it is. That is how it always will be.' It's done and finished and Yukimura looks raw and hurt and vengeful. Genichirou doesn't move when Yukimura punches him and climbs out of the bathroom window, doesn't move until the sun's risen and his brother shoves back the door and shrugs at him. 

'Told ya,' and they share a shower and his brother washes his hair, scrubs his nails into his scalp. doesn't say anything. 'Gone, huh,' his brother comments when he's done, and Genichirou nods and incidentally bends to vomit into the drain, his body pressing into his brother's legs. 'I know, it's fucked to hell,' his brother says and Genichirou doesn't see much more of Yukimura. He had known that Yukimura would leave soon, had distanced himself long before, and so all that Yukimura's school transfer does is leave his stomach feeling brittle and Jen thrashing at him at card games that Genichirou usually wins without breaking a sweat. 

But it balances, somehow, and Genichirou grows out his hair and finds a girl that doesn't mind infrequent contact and forgets, eventually, that he knew Yukimura at all. His stomach still tightens when he sees blue hair, and his throat closes when he catches sight of a thin, too-pale fragile boy, but he forgets why it matters. 

His brother is with him, after all, and when all is said and done, it's not like Genichirou really needs anyone else, is it?

"event","Ahem. This is a sequel to &hearts;_&hearts; (<lj user=sparklespiff>) excellent Akutsu/Dan semicon <a href=""http://sparklespiff.livejournal.com/97557.html"">here</a>, which you should all read if this is to make any real sense. 

She was writing it. I was was writing this. And then she posted it. And I was like 'WOW MY FIC COULD TOTALLY BE A SEQUEL.' And she wanted it to end happily. Er. I tried? &hearts;_&hearts; owns my soul, that's all I can say.

Massively unbeta'ed, as usual. And as usual, this is ALL &hearts;_&hearts;'s FAULT. TOTALLY. 

<lj-cut text=""After Akutsu-sempai drops out, Dan doesn't see anything of him."">
After Akutsu-sempai drops out, Dan doesn't see anything of him. Akutsu-sempai is always busy somewhere that's not on school campus, and the times he asks get fewer and fewer between as it becomes clear after a few months that barely anyone other than himself remembers Akutsu-sempai at all, that if he asks Sengoku, he will get a puzzled expression and then 'Oh, that guy Akutsu? He left.'  

Sengoku is one of the few people that remembers even that much of Akutsu-sempai. He hadn't thought it could be possible, that anyone could forget Akutsu-sempai, but when Akutsu-sempai wasn't there, he faded away in people's heads. No-one, Dan discovered to his horror, cared about Akutsu-sempai as much as he did, or anywhere near as much as they properly should've. 

No-one actually cared where he was or where he'd gone, they were just glad he wasn't there to cause them trouble, and Dan had cried on being told by a teacher that <i>Akutsu-sempai wasn't worth his time, such a horrible student, so foul-mouthed, so awful and lazy in class, really not worth the bother, just forget about him, did he bully you? Well, he's not here anymore, so cheer up, you won't meet anyone that nasty here anymore.</i> She hadn't understood, and by that point, Dan had given up on explaining how wrong she was. 

Dan hadn't thought it was possible to still hurt as much as he did then, but he found it was possible. One of the worst things about Akutsu-sempai, he told his mother, was that Akutsu-sempai didn't think to tell anyone anything. He hadn't even bothered to tell Dan that he'd left the school, hadn't bothered to call or visit or <i>anything</i>.

Dan never forgot Akutsu-sempai, but over time it mattered less and less that he missed Akutsu-sempai horribly, and instead focused on school and studies and sweet, clean girlfriends who nodded and smiled politely at his enthusiasm, dampened from his junior high days by the loss of Akutsu-sempai, the divorce of his parents, getting older. His smile was forced more and more often these days, and often he was tempted to yell 'Akutsu-sempai!' in the street, simply to see if someone would turn around and say irritably, 'What the fuck do you want now?' 

He felt out of place in his circle of friends, or rather they didn't quite suit him. They were too clear-cut, nice polite boys that laughed and joked and respected everyone and worked hard. None of them were like Akutsu-sempai at all, and the ones that were like him in voice and attitude jeered at him, and they weren't right either. They were too hard, Dan supposed, too unkind. Akutsu-sempai wasn't anything like them. 

It was entirely an accident that friends of Dan's friends had gone to a cafe downtown, not far from Dan's house, and had mentioned it before class the next day, chatting about the excellent food and the fast service and the horrible, horrible waiter that glared and and slammed down plates and swore if they tried to reason with him, forced out customers as soon as they disagreed with him and in general behaved shockingly. They did, however, recommend the food, just with an imperative warning to watch out for the waiter. Dan's hopes had risen when he heard this, it sounded so much like Akutsu-sempai to take so badly to waiting tables, but he couldn't think it was Akutsu-sempai. He agreed because he had nothing better to do. 

'The fuck you fucking say, you fucker,' floated out of the kitchen towards them as they walked into the door, 'you're a fucking dickwad,' and it wasn't so much a rant as a well-worn harangue. 'You're such a pissheaded moron, you fuckwit!' 

'Table eight,' the other said calmly, 'and no fucking around with the fucking wine.' A monotuous vocabulary of curses growled at subsonic level provided a background buzz to the otherwise quiet cafe, and they were right, the food was good, brought out by a guy with black hair and a scowl that neverthless smiled at them and suggested drinks. That's not the waiter, they were told, that was one of the cooks, the waiter must be in the kitchen, which was exactly where he should stay. Their desserts, however, were brought out by a guy that twisted around tables and managed to slide through three-inch gaps without breaking a sweat, someone that had grey hair and big pale hands and was silent as he set down their plates, no ceremony or greeting whatsoever, someone that somehow managed to hide his face from all of them through some trick of his body and height and the smell wafting from the desserts. 

Dan stared at the long line of the man's back as he made his way back to the kitchen, stared at the arrogant set of shoulders and how his head was tipped for maximum insolence, and forgot to eat his cake. The man came back out later, cursed at seeing Dan's plate almost full. 'You gonna eat that?' It sounded like Akutsu-sempai's voice, almost like, and Dan froze as the man growled and yanked the plate into the air with familiar bad grace.  'Akutsu-sempai?' 

'The fuck you want?' The automatic reply, said too fast and without thinking, made Dan's heart trip-hammer in his chest and somehow, in the second it took for Dan to get the courage to look up, Akutsu-sempai had gone. 

'Hey, you know him?' 

'No,' Dan said as they stood. ""I thought maybe, but no.' 

'Don't see why you'd want to know a guy like that.' Dan didn't bother to respond, just looked at the man's back as he moved around in the kitchen until his friends dragged him out. 

Late the next night after classes, Dan came to the cafe by himself and sat down at an empty table, glancing at the menu and waiting for someone to come by. He didnt respond when Akutsu-sempai strode up to the table and stood in front of him, pen in hand, and it was Akutsu-sempai - the way he moved, the muscles in his wrists, how he slouched even when standing ramrod straight was all Akutsu-sempai. 

'You gonna fucking order anything?' Dan looked up at him, saw yellow eyes flicker. 'Akutsu-sempai.' 

'Dan,' Akutsu-sempai said, and Dan thought he might say something else, but he just said, 'You gonna order?' Dan gave his order, a little numbly; it was as if Akutsu-sempai didn't care at all that his Dan had come to find him. 'My shift ends in an hour,' Akutsu-sempai says in passing, and there's a little hope there. But Dan squashes it down, thinks, <i>this is Akutsu-sempai</i>, and it doesn't mean as much as it should. 

'Eat,' Akutsu-sempai says when he comes back with Dan's plate brimming. 'You're too fucking skinny.' Dan's smile makes Akutsu-sempai wave his hands and go 'Yeah, yeah, whatever, the fuck,' as he leaves, and Dan's smile broadens.

Walking to Akutsu-sempai's place is surreal. Dan's grown some, but Akutsu's grown even more, if that were possible, and he still towers over Dan, is still twice as broad and ten times as menacing in his new lack of care - Dan's Akutsu-sempai cared about everything; this Akutsu-sempai didn't seem to care about anything - and even his threadbare coat and bad nails and the cigarette he shakes out of the packet with the ease of long habit don't shake the fact that this is Akutsu-sempai, finally. 

'Akutsu-sempai?' 

'Don't call me that,' he says, blowing smoke above Dan's head. 'I'm not your fucking sempai any more.' Dan ignores it and goes on. 'Why did you leave school?' 

'No point in me being there, nothing to keep me.' Dan stiffens, draws in a sharp breath, pauses; but Akutsu-sempai keeps walking as he always has, and Dan hurries to catch up to his too-long strides. 

'There was me, Akutsu-sempai,' Dan says, and Akutsu turns and shrugs, more smoke, voice practical. 

'You'd forget about me in time.' 

'I didn't desu!' Dan blushes as the broken habit comes back in full, he'd spent so long breaking himself of it and now Akutsu-sempai had made it come out again, but he couldn't stop. 'I never did desu! You just left me, Akutsu-sempai desu!' 

'Yeah, I fucking did. And don't fucking cry.' Dan cries anyway, sniffles and whimpers all the way to Akutsu's flat, feeling Akutsu-sempai's effort to ignore him. 'I share with a bunch of guys,' Akutsu-sempai says as they go in. 'They're a bunch of bastards, so don't get yourself fucking killed or anything, going around here by yourself.' To get in, they have to step over a girl slumped on the steps, eyes open and glazed over. Dan pauses, looks down at her face, at her twitching jaw and nerveless smile. 

'Shouldn't we help her desu?' Akutsu-sempai steps back down from where he was about to bang his way in and grabs Dan's elbow, yanks him up and over easy as anything, and Dan's feet kick the girl in the face but she doesn't notice his apology, just twitches and smiles. 

'The bitch is home!' someone roars from inside, and Akutsu shrugs his way in, still dragging Dan, lighting another cigarette off the one in his mouth and throwing the butt out of a dirty window above their head. 

'Yeah, he fucking is, and he's gonna fucking kill if you took all the fucking beer again!' Akutsu-sempai pulls him into the kitchen, Dan trying not to trip on broken lino as Akutsu-sempai lets go and noisily searches the fridge. 

'You want anything?' Dan shakes his head no, but Akutsu hands him a juice bottle, gummed around the top, and takes three beers for himself, clinking between his fingers as ash drops from the cigarette in his mouth. 'Follow me, and step where I fucking step.'

'Hey, the bitch got someone with him? Let's see her, bet she's a hot bitch like that last one!' 

'Fucking dickwads,' Akutsu-sempai mutters next to him, but he doesn't correct the assumptions yelled through open doors by people whose faces Dan can't see, but he can see their waving fingers, hear their laughter and it becomes clearer, as they climb the stairs, that this Akutsu-sempai is not his Akutsu-sempai, but a different Akutsu-sempai. His Akutsu-sempai would never live here, and he would never live with bad people. 

'Akutsu-sempai, you brought a girl home desu?' Akutsu-sempai doesn't bother to glance at him, just stomps up the stairs with Dan close behind, stepping in strange places that Dan tries follow as best as he can. 'Yeah.' 

Akutsu-sempai's room is strange and bare, not at all like what's Dan used to. Akutsu-sempai slouches his way in, gestures Dan to the chair that looks like it'll fall apart in a breeze. 

'Sit the fuck down,' Akutsu-sempai orders, and Dan does. Akutsu pulls off his coat, dumps it on the floor by the door, almost rips through his overshirt, and his arms are suddenly bare, black ink marking his right arm above and below the elbow in curves and spikes, some sort of intricate symbol that Dan can't make out the beginning or end of however he looks at it. Akutsu-sempai lights another cigarette the same way as he did before, and Dan wonders how many packs he goes through, if that is responsible for the new depth and rumble in Akutsu-sempai's voice. 

'Those are bad for you, desu.' 

'You're not fucking here to talk about my fucking lungs.' Dan rocks back in the chair, clasps his hands around the bottle. 'Where did you go desu?' Akutsu-sempai blows an annoyed breath. 'Didn't. Dropped out, got a job. Got a bunch of jobs. Kept getting fucking fired, 'til I found that cafe.' 

'I'm in second year of high school, desu,' and has it really been four years? Dan thinks it's been longer, would think it was a thousand times as long as it would take to count all the new scars on Akutsu-sempai's hands, but if he thinks about the bruise on Akutsu-sempai's shoulder or the purple-white slash across his collarbone, Dan knows he's going to cry again. 'It's good to see you desu,' Dan says, and Akutsu-sempai hesitates, grumbles. 'Yeah, whatever.' and it's so much like Akutsu-sempai that Dan knows he is going to cry, so he stares very hard at the bottle in his hands and tries to focus on being happy for Akutsu-sempai. 

'You right?' Akutsu-sempai's breath is smelly and noisy from where he's on the floor, and Dan can look down on him and notice that from this angle, Akutsu looks younger than he is, and it feels wrong to be taller than Akutsu-sempai. Akutsu-sempai is close, too close, and Dan feels dizzy and wrong before Akutsu-sempai's eyes narrow and he steps up and away in a movement so fluid that it hammers <i>Akutsu-sempai</i> into his brain. 

'I'm fine,' Dan lies, and from the look and insult he gets, Akutsu-sempai doesn't believe him, and that cheers Dan more than anything else. Akutsu-sempai, unlike everyone else Dan knows, isn't fooled by Dan's lies, however good he is at them now. But Akutus-sempai lies a lot, so Dan supposes he would know, and that's not so good. 

'You doing okay?' Dan nods, but Akutsu doesn't say anything, and so Dan starts talking. He tells Akutsu-sempai about his parents, about his girlfriend, his ex-girlfriend, his friends, his cousins, the trip he had to Osaka last winter, his teachers, while Akutsu-sempai is stretched out on the bed smoking the rest of the pack and drinking both beers and pretending he isn't listening, except that Akutsu-sempai bangs on the walls and shouts for the neighbours to shut the fuck up when they drown out Dan's voice. When he's finished, neither of them say anything, and Dan's face burns bright red at how unfair he's being, everything he's saying that is one, three years old, when clearly Akutsu-sempai didn't need to know about any of it. 

'Why are you even fucking here?' Akutsu sounds tired and Dan sees more of Akutsu's weariness and more of the way Akutsu-sempai moves like he's about to drop dead where he is, like he wants to pass out and never wake up. Dan wonders if life could ever be that bad, and decides that Akutsu-sempai is stupid sometimes, except he can't really know, so none of it makes any sense at all. Akutsu-sempai is a little drunk now, Dan supposes; he's never really seen anyone drunk, so he's not quite sure. But Akutsu-sempai is moving differently now, and Dan tries his best not to flinch when Akutsu drops to rock on the balls of his feet, a damaged cigarette spinning in his fingers, the lit end looking like it passes through Akutsu-sempai's fingers even though Dan knows its not possible. 

'You don't even fucking know why, do you.' It's not a question, even though it's worded like one. 'Real cute of you, you fuckwit.' It's bizarrely tender-sounding, but there's danger in Akutsu-sempai's fingers that are flicking the cigarette too close to his leg and Akutsu-sempai's eyes aren't particularly merciful, and Dan doesn't feel brave enough to make Akutsu-sempai remember what happened, isn't brave enough to ask if Akutsu-sempai ever forgot. 

'I didn't mean to desu,' Dan cracks, and it might be about then and it might be about now. It doesn't matter, because Akutsu-sempai is grinding the butt into the wall and flexing his right hand just over Dan's lap, and Dan can see the particular scars from the wall then, three across Akutsu-sempai's knuckles and another on the webbing of his thumb. 

'Doesn't fucking matter,' Akutsu-sempai snorts, and he's looking at his hand, but his hand is also right over Dan's thigh, and Dan's blushing now, because Akutsu-sempai is so close and it might've been wrong and it might've been right, but nothing's changed. <i>It's not fair</i>, Dan's mind stutters, <i>I didn't want this to happen, it wasn't my fault, you're scaring me, Akutsu-sempai</i> -- 

Akutsu-sempai is turned away when Dan looks up, and Dan realises that he must have said it out loud, because Akutsu-sempai isn't looking at him, but at the door, and his face is horrible, like he's just eaten something nasty and it's come back up for the second, third time, and his mouth is twisted the way it is when he's trying not to crack out dry laughter, the kind of bitterness that Dan's always hated and tried to ward off however he could. 

'Akutsu-sempai?'

'Don't fucking call me that,' Akutsu-sempai snaps, and then Akutsu-sempai relaxes, tips back onto the floor, staring up at Dan from between Dan's legs, his head at a funny angle and his hair spiked all wrong, and somehow he's drained half of another beer bottle, swaying between Akutsu-sempai's loose fingers, and the way Akutsu-sempai cocks his head at Dan is familiar and strange all at once. 

'You shouldn't even be here,' Akutsu-sempai says, and then Akutsu-sempai waves off Dan's attempt to apologise and checks Dan's watch for him, fingers chilly and dry, calluses hard against Dan's soft skin, and Dan remembers and shivers as Akutsu-sempai curses at the time, drops Dan's wrist. 'Your parents are gonna be going fucking insane.' Dan can still feel Akutsu's fingers around his wrist, like he's been given handcuffs, and Akutsu-sempai's face goes strange for a moment. Dan realises that he is rubbing at where Akutsu-sempai's fingers were, like he's trying to scrape something off. He glances up and draws back when Akutsu-sempai's shoulders go tense, like he wants to hit something but can't, and that makes Akutsu-sempai worse. 'Right,' Akutsu-sempai says eventually. 'Your parents are fucking insane and don't give a damn. They trust you so fucking much.' 

'I don't live with my father anymore,' Dan says quietly. 'Weren't you listening, desu?' Akutsu-sempai gets this <i>ohshit</i> face for a split-second before Akutsu-sempai shrugs. 'Can't have heard every fucking thing. Not like I was there to fucking know.' 

'Akutsu-sempai,' Dan says reproachfully, and it's almost, almost like his first year of junior high, because Akutsu snorts and turns away with an eyeroll, but now Akutsu-sempai turns back and gets up and looks down at him, and Dan feels very small and raw when Akutsu-sempai gives him a long, considering once-over. 'Huh. Guess you got something going on, to catch that Miyako twat,' and Dan has to smile, because it's Akutsu-sempai and he's terrible at compliments, giving them backhanded and clumsily, but they always mean the same thing as if he'd said it straight out. 

'Yeah, whatever, brat. I'm fucking bored, and you've got to get home before it's fucking sunrise.' Dan nods and stands and Akutsu-sempai picks up the coat, shrugs it on over the undershirt and pulls another pack of cigarettes out of a drawer that he has to lean on to open and kick to force shut, and Dan wonders if maybe Akutsu-sempai really can't afford to get a new one. Akutsu stomps down the stairs the same way as he did when they were going up, although his insults are fast and loose and he tips his head back to look at Dan a couple times, risking death with a 'Keh!' at something Dan doesn't know. Akutsu-sempai stops by the kitchen for more beer, and Dan wonders how much Akutsu-sempai drinks, if he can drink this much of anything and still be this steady on his feet. 

'Come on,' Akutsu-sempai orders, and the girl is gone, so they clatter down the steps and Akutsu-sempai mock-salutes a guy sitting in the yard, gurgling what Dan thinks must be a laugh but sounds more like he's drowning instead. 'That's Major General Tomuko,' Akutsu-sempai tells him while digging in his pockets for a lighter, 'he was a real bigshot 'til he fucked up and blew someone's brains out, something like that. He sings a lot. Great Orbison, but fucking terrible at Elvis.' 

Akutsu-sempai tells him this perfectly conversationally, as though they are not walking to Dan's home at three am and as though Akutsu-sempai must be be perfectly fine in the thin clothes he has on when Dan's wrapped in four layers and isn't warm, as though Akutsu-sempai hasn't drunk four bottles of beer in the last four hours and it is as if Dan is comfortable with all this, with having Akutsu-sempai so close and so overpowering in his voice and gestures and booze-cigarette-Akutsu-sempai smell. And in truth, Dan is and isn't. It's perfectly right, and it's perfectly wrong, because neither of them should've ever been in this situation. 

Dan notices that, as they walk and the suburbs turn nicer and quieter and more domestic, that Akutsu-sempai takes harder drags and scowls fiercely and is utterly uncomfortable with being there, that Akutsu-sempai doesn't fit with the picture of a peaceful suburb at three am. Akutsu-sempai is more about beer and fighting and where the next cigarettes are coming from, and even though Dan knows this, he doesn't know why Akutsu-sempai can't translate from where he is to where he should be. 

Akutsu-sempai looks tired and dull as they stand awkwardly on Dan's porch, as though the life's been drained out of him by the effort it took to walk Dan home. It takes Dan's two, three steps closer, Dan's hesitant kiss against the corner of Akutsu-sempai's mouth in that moment between exhalation and inhalation, to galvanise Akutsu-sempai into bitter laughter, broken by a deep cough, as he stares at Dan with eyes that look more than a little wild. 'You're still fucking stuck?' Dan nods, fidgets, breaks into a flurry of explanation. 

'I never forgot you even when everyone else did desu I still - I still think you're awesome desu and I don't want you to ever leave me like that again desu -' Akutsu-sempai shakes his head, takes a decisive drag. 

'Never gonna fucking happen,' Akutsu-sempai says slowly, as though finishing a lengthy speech, 'Not now, not tomorrow, not fucking ever. I want you to fuck off and leave me alone and forget me.' Akutsu-sempai jerks him forwards by his shirt, picks him up off the ground. 'Just fucking do it, Taichi.' 

Akutsu-sempai sets him down a lot more gently than he picked him up, and it leaves Dan time to duck under Akutsu-sempai's arm and kiss him again, properly this time, fumbling a little. Akutsu-sempai's all tense and his mouth feels strange when Akutsu-sempai responds, crushes him closer and drives his tongue into Dan's mouth, grips the back of Dan's head with too-strong fingers and it hurts, <i>exactly like then</i>, and Dan feels himself start to panic, start to gasp and flail and kick, and Akutsu-sempai is quick to put him down and step out of the light and when Dan recovers and says 'Akutsu-sempai' and tears start, Akutsu-sempai isn't there, isn't anywhere near even when Dan yells, and the only sign that Akutsu-sempai's been there is the butt smouldering on the path.

'Taichi? You're up late.' 

'Mother,' Dan says, and rubs away tears with the backs of his hands, feels twelve and stupid and empty again, and the back of his head hurts and the inside of his lip hurts where Akutsu-sempai caught it with too-sharp teeth, and it's amazing, really, how he hurts deep between his legs, even though nothing like that has happened this time, and how much he doesn't like himself, it's all wrong. 

'You need to sleep,' is all his mother says, and she leads him inside and dresses him like he's three years old and she puts him to bed, leaves the light on and closes the door when Dan asks. He dreams strangely, of Akutsu-sempai holding him down, of Akutsu-sempai's mouth on his cock like his girlfriends do sometimes, dreams of Akutsu-sempai in him, like then but nicer, imagines himself gasping like his girlfriends do, imagines that Akutsu is above and behind him, biting his shoulder. He wakes up sticky and on his knees, with his hand wrapped around his cock and his mouth in his pillow, and he feels rawer, lighter. 

The next time he sees Akutsu-sempai is when Dan is at an event, watching his friends win prizes he could never get, and Dan is lightheaded from alcohol and someone takes the bottle he's about to drink from, tells him to stop being a stupid little dick, hands him water instead and is gone by the time Dan remembers to touch him and make sure he is real, and it is then that he has sex with Minoya, a friend of a friend's brother that Dan's admired for being as much like Akutsu-sempai as anyone could be without being Akutsu-sempai, is fucked and kissed and Dan finds he likes it, and he doesn't; there's something wrong about having someone else's body pressed against his, there's something wrong with the way Minoya's teeth aren't as sharp, that Minoya isn't as forceful as he imagines Akutsu-sempai would be. 

When he wakes, he vaguely remembers asking Minoya to push harder, to hurt him more, until Minoya's nails were tearing holes in his back and Dan's ass felt like it would tear, and he goes to the bathroom and vomits until he brings up nothing but bile, palms his cock tightly in the shower and bites back his frustration. Nevertheless, he goes out, unoffically, with Minoya until Minoya declares him a slut for wanting it so much, until Minoya snaps and calls him a goddamn insane freak, did he want Minoya to fucking hurt him or some shit like that? and it's not until Minoya notices Dan's hard-on that Minoya punches him and leaves. 

He goes to see Akutsu-sempai late at night the following week, hollow and calm, turns up at Akutsu-sempai's apartment and knocks and is cornered in the kitchen by one of Akutsu-sempai's friends, a nasty-faced man with small eyes and a too-tight grip on his libido, and finds that, as weak as he is, he can't really resist. The man's body is lean and old and his breath is fouler than Akutsu-sempai's, and Dan has his eyes closed and is pinned to the wall with the man grinding against him. 

It isn't until the weight is suddenly pulled off him and he hears the crack of breaking bone that Dan starts to cry, big gulping sobs that he can't really breathe through, and he thinks he sinks down, but he's not sure; the only think he's aware of is Akutsu-sempai's furious wonderful voice, explaining in great anatomical detail how he would remove each layer of the man's skin if he ever, ever, fucking touched Dan again. 

Akutsu-sempai carries him then, Dan's sure of it, picks him up and carries him silently up the stairs, puts Dan down on Akutsu-sempai's bed and gets out another packet of cigarettes, drags the chair over by the bed and sits down in it and waits for Dan to stop crying. It takes Dan a long time, but Akutsu-sempai doesn't move, just keeps smoking without a word.  

'I fucking warned you about them,' is the first thing Akutsu-sempai yells at him when Dan sits up and doesn't look up from the blankets. 'You stupid little fuckwit,' Akutsu-sempai adds, calmer now, and Dan answers with 'I didn't know what to do,' and he's embarrassed at how croaky he sounds.

'The fuck, Taichi,' and Akutsu-sempai's hand is holding a glass of water, shoved into his field of view. 'Your voice is shot to hell.' 

'I didn't know desu,' Dan continues, because it's important and if he looks at Akutsu-sempai he won't be able to finish. 'I didn't know anything about it desu and I didn't know if you'd let me come back and Minoya isn't the same as you desu, he's different and he's nicer to me, desu, but I didn't know desu.' 

'You're not making any fucking sense,' and Dan knows Akutsu-sempai is starting to understand.

'It wasn't your fault, I never blamed you desu.' 

'Leaving was the best fucking thing to do,' and Dan wants to look at Akutsu-sempai and see if Akutsu-sempai is lying or not, because now he can't really tell if he's not looking at him, but if he looks he'll have to see Akutsu-sempai's face. 'This is so fucked up,' Akutsu-sempai says, too quiet for Dan to really hear if Dan doesn't concentrate. 'So fucking fucked -' 

'Akutsu-sempai.' Dan looks up, flicks his eyes to Akutsu-sempai's mouth, slowly looks over Akutsu-sempai's shoulders and arms and body, back up to his face, and watches Akutsu-sempai's throat jump. Dan now knew how to manipulate with his cuteness, his prettiness, and he wasn't above using it, especially with Akutsu-sempai. 'Akutsu-sempai,' Dan says again, makes it an invitation, and Akutsu-sempai twitches, looks away. 

'Taichi, stop,' Akutsu-sempai commands, threatening now, and this Akutsu-sempai is more dangerous than before, which is really does mean a lot, but if Akutsu-sempai hurts him now, Dan won't mind at all. 'Akutsu-sempai,' Dan says again, and Dan reaches out, puts a hand on Akutsu-sempai's shoulder, waits to be pushed back, away, pushed down. Akutsu doesn't do anything, but his muscles jump as Dan traces them to his face, brushes his fingers over Akutsu-sempai's lips. Akutsu-sempai bears it for a few moments before he jerks his head back, drawing in a quick breath. 'Taichi, goddamnit, don't fucking play this game, you don't want to push this any fucking further -'  

'I don't want to sleep by myself, Akutsu-sempai,' Dan says, and Akutsu-sempai looks like he's about to refuse and either storm off or punch Dan, but after a few seconds he nods, mouth grim. 'Move the fuck over.' Dan nudges towards the wall, and Akutsu turns off the lights, lets weak moonlight do the illuminating, and Dan hears Akutu-sempai's clothes unzip and thump to the floor, feels Akutsu-sempai's weight settle next to him. 

'Go to fucking sleep,' Akutsu-sempai says, and Dan doesn't, but listens to Akutsu-sempai's harsh breathing, imagines that he can hear his own heartbeat. After a few minutes, he yawns and rolls over to Akutsu-sempai under the blankets, settles almost on top of Akutsu-sempai, and Akutsu-sempai tenses and tries to roll away, but he doesn't push Dan off entirely and he's surprisingly warm, and Dan falls asleep like that, Akutsu-sempai's bare skin smooth under his, Akutsu-sempai's breath in time to his own. 

Dan wakes up alone, wakes up to cold space, but Akutsu-sempai's coat isn't gone and his shirt is still on the floor, so Dan guesses he must be somewhere in the house, and there's noise from next door and downstairs, what sounds like rattling pots and pans, and Dan finds that he is somehow almost naked, his trousers tangled around his legs and his shirt still caught by one arm. Someone opens the door and peers through, a girl without makeup and scraped, untidy hair. 

'Hey, Sleeping Beauty's up,' she says to someone behind, and Akutsu pushes his way past her, plates on one arm in a way he must have learned at some point in the cafe, the way Dan could never do.

'Get the fuck away, you filthy whore,' Akutsu-sempai says, and Dan can tell he doesn't mean it. The girl seems to know too, she just laughs and cracks gum. 

'Kettle-fucking-pot, you cockwhore,' and Dan's mouth falls open and Akutsu-sempai shoves her out of the doorway, slams the door in her face. Akutsu-sempai dumps a plate into Dan's lap. 

'Eat.' Akutsu-sempai is naked from his hips up, and in the light he makes Dan's mouth go dry and his lowriders make Dan's cock go half-hard, and it's difficult for Dan to concentrate when Akutsu's on display like that. Akutsu eats, slurping his way through ramen, chopsticks working efficiently, but Dan's too busy staring to notice when they stop moving. 

'Stop fucking staring at me,' Akutsu-sempai mutters, and it is then that Dan remembers that Akutsu-sempai hates being looked at in full, hates attention to his body. 

'Sorry,  Akutsu-sempai.' 

'Don't fucking call me that,' Akutsu-sempai grouches, but he doesn't say any more when Dan sneaks looks at him over his own ramen, and when they're both finished and their bowls are stacked on the floor, Akutsu-sempai reaches for his shirt, tosses it aside, and tugs one out of a pile, sniffs it, pulls it on. This gives Dan the opportunity to stare as much as he likes, and when Akutsu-sempai is turned back around, Akutsu-sempai's expression is odd, like that time, and Dan feels something tilt off-balance. 

'You fuckwit,' Akutsu-sempai says, and then Akutsu-sempai's mouth is on his, Dan's being pressed backwards into the bed and Akutsu-sempai is kneeling over him and Akutsu-sempai is there and here, and Dan can't think at all. Dan pulls back to breathe, and Akutsu-sempai's hand is flat and warm on his chest, and then Akutsu-sempai rolls over and pulls Dan with him. It's strange to be on top of Akutsu-sempai, to be lying flat on his chest and hip and thigh, and Dan feels something stir against his leg, feels Akutsu-sempai's breath shudder. 

'Akutsu-sempai?' 

'You gotta stop fucking calling me that,' and then they're kissing again, and it's good, he feels safe and warm and Akutsu-sempai's hands are everywhere but there and he wants Akutsu-sempai to touch him, so badly, so he takes Akutus-sempai's hand and pulls it to his cock while Akutsu-sempai's occupied with Dan's neck, and Akutsu-sempi freezes for a split-second, draws in a laugh. 'You don't know what the fuck you're doing.' 

'I do too,' Dan insists, and to prove it Dan slides down his body and thumbs open Akutsu-sempai's jeans and strokes there, and Akutsu-sempai makes funny noises and pulls Dan to lie flat against him, traps their hands between their bodies and then Akutsu-sempai's hand is big and warm around his and Dan feels Akutsu-sempai's heart hammering against his face, and it's so nice, and Dan buries his face in Akutsu-sempai's chest when he comes, knows that Akutsu-sempai is going to blame him for making Akutsu-sempai's pants dirty, and then he feels Akutsu-sempai still big and hard in his hand. Dan looks up to see Akutsu-sempai's face, alive and intent, and then Dan moves so his head is at Akutsu-sempai's hips and Akutsu-sempai tries to stop him, but Dan's got his mouth on Akutsu-sempai's cock and he hasn't really done it before so it's a bit awkward, but Akutsu-sempai moans and comes anyway and Dan chokes on it and it tastes funny so he spits it out over the side. 

'Wise of you,' Akutsu-sempai says. 'It's a fucking bugger to swallow.' His voice sounds funny and Dan doesn't trust his own, so Dan just climbs back up the bed and sprawls on top of Akutsu-sempai, who snorts but doesn't kick him off. They're both sticky and Dan feels a little uncomfortable, hurts a little somewhere he shouldn't, and he wants to ask Akutsu-sempai everything, knows that Akutsu-sempai would have some kind of answer for every question Dan could ever ask except the important ones. But he doesn't want to ask, not really, because Akutsu-sempai looks like he's thinking about something, and not particularly hard either, but it looks like it might be important by the way Akutsu-sempai's fingers are drawing things on Dan's back, tapping and stroking across his shoulders, and Dan isn't sure if Akutsu-sempai knows he's doing it. 

'Taichi.' Akutsu-sempai's voice is very serious. 'You got to fucking let go.' Dan panics for a moment, thinks <i>what did I just do if I didn't say I wanted to be here? what are you saying Akutsu-sempai?</i> but his fingers are still on Dan's back, and Dan realises that it's a rote warning, that Akutsu-sempai's saying it out of some strange duty to protect and warn Dan from himself, that it's a chance to walk out and never come back and just live with all of it ending like this. 

Dan seriously considers that for a moment, and thinks: <i>No</i>. 'You're stupid sometimes, Akutsu.' It feels strange to drop the sempai, strange and wrong, but Akutsu-sempai's eyes widen and then Akutsu-sempai, <i>Akutsu</i>, kisses Dan's forehead and his smile is real for the first time Dan's seen since they met in the cafe.  

'You fucking featherhead,' and Dan knows what Akutsu-sempai means, bats at Akutsu-sempai's shoulder. 

'You need to sleep,' Dan tells him. 

'Well, you just gotta fucking stay right here, then,' and Dan feels his smile go so bright. 'That's not a good thing, you nitwit,' Akutsu points out with that tone of irritated forebearance he only uses with Dan. 

'It's hard for it to be a bad thing when it's you desu.' Akutsu rolls his eyes and tells Dan to shut the fuck up and it's a good day, Dan decides, it's the best day ever. 

The version Akutsu and Dan tell people is shorter and goes something like: <i>old schoolfriends, seperated for a while, got back into contact, things happened and here we are</i>, though Akutsu puts a lot more swearing into it and Dan gets mushy, but that's the basic story, and it doesn't matter if they keep the precise details to themselves. It doesn't matter if everyone else doesn't believe them, thinks that they can't possibly be happy with Akutsu stomping around the old sharehouse and endearing himself to his boss through his inability to be bad at anything he did, with Dan in high school and suddenly pulling excellent grades and informing everyone that Akutsu said <i>me too, you stupid asswipe</i> that morning when Dan said he loved him. It didn't matter if Akutsu meeting him at school and insulting everyone that passed within ten meters, dropping cigarette butts all over the place, offended the school authorities so much that Dan had to placate them, and it didn't matter if Dan pissed off Akutsu's boss so much with his naivete and cuteness that Akutsu had to take the knives away from him. 

Once a year, they go to a bridge somewhere in Hiroshima and do nothing but sit by the river and watch, Dan looking at his feet and Akutsu smoking in silence. Akutsu counts off the days the first time this happens, makes a few calculations, and sucks in a breath and has to go somewhere else for a  few days, because that was a stupid fuckwit anniversary to have, and during the few days around that time, they're both quiet and they touch a lot but they don't do any more, mainly because Dan always gets high-strung and overwhelmed by Akutsu and Akutsu's mouth twists into the wrong shapes when Dan kisses him. 

It doesn't matter, though; Dan's happy now, and Akutsu is too, even if he grumbles and calls Dan a nitwit in the way that, in Akutsu's softened voice and his extra rumble, means <i>I love you too</i>.

<b>Title</b>: untitled #015
<b>Fandom</b>: Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing</b>: Kabaji-Atobe centric
<b>Author</b>: Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> Written a month ago after discussing Kabaji with <lj user=wonapalei>. 
<lj-cut text=""He doesn't mind Atobe.""> 
He doesn't mind Atobe. 

People look at him and think words like <i>simple</i>, and he doesn't mind that either. It's how they think of things. He sees them look at him and away, look and think words that mean to say he is nothing, but he knows he is <i>something</i>. Therefore, they are wrong. 

Atobe takes him as a good thing, and turns <i>simple-minded</i> into something Kabaji can use. It's the first time that someone's seen it like that, and so he is grateful to Atobe. He doesn't understand Atobe, or claim to, or want to. He doesn't need to, because Atobe is Atobe and that is it. Understanding him is pointless, like with everything else. Copying him is also pointless, because Atobe is not an opponent, and if he were to demand things like Atobe, he would not be treated like Atobe; he is not Atobe, and that is the end of it. 

Others look at them and do not understand, because they think about it in terms that are too complicated. It is easier for them to say 'Atobe treats Kabaji badly' than for them to work out that Kabaji doesn't mind; welcomes it, even. He is the extra hand at Atobe's side, he is the support that can be relied on to be with Atobe, to act and think as Atobe wishes. 

Atobe says only what is true. True in terms of Atobe's thinking, so Atobe is right in his own mind. But Atobe is also right in Kabaji's understanding, and so the only thing to do is agree. He does not agree for the sake of it, and he does not agree because it is Atobe who says these things. He agrees because Atobe is right. They are independent bodies, but their minds aren't, not really, and Kabaji doesn't mind that either. He lets himself be as much a part of Atobe's life as Atobe himself -- the one who Atobe can command without looking to see if he is there because of course Kabaji will be, the one that follows Atobe's minute orders in ways more natural than Atobe's orchestrated cheering -- and doesn't bother to mind. 

Part of it is that when Atobe wins against the one that played like his glasses were on fire and he had nothing left but principles and Kabaji loses that one time at the Kanto tourmanet Atobe doesn't treat him like the others who lose. Kabaji is Kabaji, whether he wins or loses; Atobe is Atobe, whether he wins or loses, and if Atobe wishes for a towel, a drink, anything from Kabaji, it will be given. That is Kabaji. 

He knows that if there is a time when he does not agree with Atobe, Atobe will be furious; Atobe will be upset, and Atobe will listen to Kabaji. That is not something Kabaji particularly wants to see, but he knows it will happen. For now, he is Atobe's. He is all Atobe's. He might be someone else's sooner or later; but for now, he is Atobe's and Atobe's alone, and he can't say he dislikes or hates Atobe, or even likes Atobe. It's like asking if someone was an arm, and then asking the arm how it felt about the body. 

He is Atobe's, and Atobe is his as much as he is Atobe's, and he is fine with that. 

Kabaji knows Atobe doesn't mind either.

<b>Title</b>: untitled #016
<b>Fandom</b>: Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing</b>: Atobe-Tezuka centric.
<b>Author</b>: Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> Atobe thinking about Tezuka, referencing Hyotei Atobe-Tezuka match. 
<lj-cut text=""Atobe finds Tezuka interesting.""> 
Atobe finds Tezuka interesting. 

Not interesting along the lines of, say, a new variety of orchid that he's obliged to listen to someone blather about the beauty of for half an hour, or interesting in the way that he's learnt to control the crowd of supporters that come to each match (by default as much as the stony, icy stare of their coach), but interesting in the way a new language can be, complicated and oddly familiar and strange with its sounds that catch his ear and trick his brain. Learning to play Tezuka is just a little like learning to live, and he wants more of it. He wants to know more, grasp the sounds of Tezuka that mean things in Tezuka's mind that register nothing in Atobe's. 

Atobe wants to learn his play, his tennis, backhands and spin; he wants - needs - to change <i>how the hell does he</i>do<i> that</i>?' into something he can answer with ease.  It bothers him, not knowing. He hopes that if he can know enough of Tezuka's language, he can make Tezuka his opponent, so he is fighting a boy. Not a ghost, not the figure of an idea, not something to live and die for, but Tezuka. 

He might have won the Kantou Tournament match, but he didn't <i>win</i>. It bothers him and itches under his skin, wobbles and lurks inside his head to seize him at inopportune times, and it feels like when he was watching Shishido's reaction training - surprise and understanding not entirely welcome, but necessary. He hates that it's necessary, but he tells himself that he will cope with it. That if he plays Tezuka again, watches and listens and tries to fathom Tezuka into something(captain)-someone(tezuka) he can defeat, it will not feel like he lost. 

He is the captain of Hyotei. He does not lose. 

Tezuka is the captain of Seigaku. He does not lose, either. And he pulls it off better than Atobe, something that's frankly irritating and inevitable all the same. It <i>is</i> Tezuka, after all. 

He thinks that's perhaps one thing that he won, over the skinny little freshman (more brat than strength) and the rest of Tezuka' team -- Tezuka has played him. <i>Played</i>, to the full of his ability.

He knows this, at least: In tennis, Tezuka is as unfathomable as ever.

Nights at Kawamura Sushi after tournaments usually follow along the same predictable lines, being part of why Tezuka likes them. But there are certain definable moments that occur every time.

Someone is singing -- Eiji -- someone is fighting with another, and he doesn't need to look to know it's Momo and Kaidoh; someone is smiling at his back, and he knows it is Fuji. There is someone talking to Kawamura senior and junior, and he knows without listening that it is Oishi; and then there is someone who will, in a few seconds, rise from where he sits caught between Momo and Kaidoh on one side and Fuji and Inui on the other, rise and take the seat next to Tezuka and say nothing; and that someone is Echizen. 

He wonders if it is like this for every captain, to know his team's every breath and word, to see and know and hear and feel their emotions without needing to look or listen or touch. They are extensions of his ambition, extensions of his goals and his dreams, and he pushes them more than they know, drives them on as their captain. He suspects he also drives them by being <i>himself</i>, and that thought is foreign to his mind. He knows it is true, though, knows that if he were not Tezuka, it would not work. If he wasn't buchou, it wouldn't work either, so he concentrates on being buchou. He leaves the rest to fend for itself, since being buchou is easier than being Tezuka. It has been easier, in the last year, to say that <i>Tezuka</i> and <i>buchou</i> are one and the same, and he is glad of that.

Of course, Echizen is next to him with a can of Ponta, and how the Ponta was obtained, Tezuka has no idea; but he doesn't need to know. He doesn't need to know very much at all to know that the Ponta will be finished soon. Echizen concentrates on eating and drinking as much as he concentrates on everything else, and finishes in about the same amount of time. He also knows that when it is finished, Echizen will say nothing at all, Tezuka will say nothing at all, and it will be a little bit of peace for them both, aware of the chatter in the background and of each other. 

If someone were to ask -- not that anyone ever has, but he asks himself sometimes, practices for Nationals and the interviews that will follow, practices in slow English and careful Japanese -- he would say <i>this</i>. If someone asked what was best about being captain, best about Seigaku. Moments like this feel like when Echizen wins and defeats another opponent with another piece of his future laid open in his own hands; feels like when Kawamura comes through again and again to win with power and unwitting devotion.  

(The song in the background has changed to something hypnotic and English, and Eiji is singing worse than ever, bouncing along, and Fuji is calm and eating wasabi sushi, but it is <i>his</i> song according to Seigaku, and the smile is real and far more dangerous for it. Oishi and the Kawamuras, still; Momo and Kaidoh have finished slinging words and are fighting with turned backs and glares, relief in the set of their shoulders and eyes in having each other to snipe at, and Inui is watching and listening to it all, data in his mind but no notes in his hands. Echizen wants to ask something that he will never ask, because to ask is to doubt, so he pulls down the brim of a non-existent cap instead.) 

They are Seigaku, they are his team, and it is as simple as that.

<b>Pairing:</b> Tezuka/Ryoma.  
<b>Author: </b> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> I might expand this later on. Maybe. Probably not. Maddening, innit?
 
<lj-cut text=""This is one of the most bizzare situations that Ryoma has ever been in, and it doesn't help that Tezuka's eyes are still lined with kohl of the exact right shade to make his eyes smolder.""> 
This is one of the most bizzare situations that Ryoma has ever been in, and it doesn't help that Tezuka's eyes are still lined with kohl of the exact right shade to make his eyes smolder. Tezuka steers him out of the club in a way that is reassuringly like his buchou, a firm hand on his shoulder and another at the ready in case Ryoma should wish to escape, but Ryoma is still too stunned to say anything.

That is, until they're outside and the fresh air hits his face and it also hits him just how incredible Tezuka looks right now, even if it's kind of girly, how tight his shirt is and those jeans -- there are even heels on Tezuka's shoes, Ryoma notices, and is momentariy lost for words by the unfairness of Tezuka wearing heels when Tezuka is annoyingly tall already.

'Echizen.' Tezuka's voice is deep and a little out of breath. 'What are you doing here?'

'That's my line,' Ryoma mumbles, wishing he had his cap and settling for staring at Tezuka's chest. Tezuka's buttons are covered in leather. The top three are undone, showing collarbone and necklace and too much of what buchou looks like when he takes off his jersey in the clubroom after practice and has nothing on underneath.

'Echizen.' Ryoma scowls and looks off the side; there are girls standing there, he realises, girls watching them and waiting, and they are the ones Tezuka was dancing with. Their hair is too big and their clothes are too tight and there's too much makeup on them and really, Tezuka could do better.

'Someone dragged me here,' he admits reluctantly. 'I didn't have anything better to do.' Tezuka doesn't fold his arms across his chest, and Ryoma realises how stiff and awkward Tezuka is right now.

'It's a school night,' Tezuka points out patiently. He sounds disappointed and oddly relieved.

Ryoma ignores that in favour of, 'You could do better,' with a gesture at the girls still loitering at the door. Tezuka's eyebrows arch, and Ryoma plows on. 'This place is trashy, and they're trashy too. You could go somewhere better.'

'It's late,' Tezuka says instead, and it's as good as agreement. 'I'll take you home.' He goes back, says something to the girls, one of whom pouts and goes in; the other smiles and tosses her hair, hands Tezuka a piece of paper. Tezuka accepts it, of course, tucks it into his back pocket. They start walking.

'My dad's going to freak if you turn up with that stuff on your face.'

'I don't intend on being seen.' Tezuka sounds a little annoyed as they reach the station, and Ryoma pauses, waits for Tezuka to stop and walk back to him. 'Doesn't matter,' Ryoma tells him, and tugs Tezuka down onto one knee. Ryoma wipes off the makeup with the edge of his shirt; blusher, he guesses, blusher and some weird pale stuff and glitter.

'Watch the eyeliner,' Tezuka warns, and later, Ryoma is going to think about how surreal this night has been and convince himself that it never happened. But for now, he hesitates over Tezuka's lipstick -- buchou is wearing <i>lipstick</i> -- and blurts, 'I've never kissed someone with lipstick on.' Tezuka barely manages to blink before Ryoma pulls back. 'Euch.'

'It's not for licking,' Tezuka says patiently.

'I just wanted to try,' Ryoma shrugs, and they ride home together.

Mercifully, Nanjiroh doesn't say anything when Tezuka, stone-faced, accepts Rinako's thanks and leaves stiffly with Ryoma's mouth smudged the same colour as his lipstick.

<b>Author: </b> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> Future-fic. I'm probably going to write more in this specific fic 'verse; I like the idea. 

<lj-cut text=""The reporter is annoying and looks about three days' worth of tired; Ryoma doesn't respond, but Tezuka tries to.""> 
The reporter is annoying and looks about three days' worth of tired; Ryoma doesn't respond, but Tezuka tries to. 'We've known each other for six years now.' Tezuka's English is careful and British-accented; they had an exchange student once, apparently, a short girl with pigtails and freckles. The idea of Tezuka having a girl in his house rankled then, and it rankles now as it does whenever he hears Tezuka speak English. He's never been able to have Tezuka take his own New York accent, however much he tries.

'He was my buchou,' Ryoma adds and concludes, and for the significance packed into it, it could be <i>my captain my partner my rival my lover my best friend</i>, and it could be none of these things. The reporter blinks and shifts in her chair. 'Ah-'

'It means 'captain',' Tezuka translates. 'I captained the tennis team when he first transferred to Japan.' Ryoma hates how the post-match interviews always have them both together, questioning them alternately, but at the same time, he gets to annoy Tezuka by prodding him with his knees and feet under the table.

It's well-known by now that they answer for each other. It's also well-known that sometimes Ryoma loses, and that Tezuka inevitably saves the articles of any reporter that makes the mistake of attempting to interview Ryoma alone; Ryoma is never forthcoming, and while Tezuka is terse, at least he answers. Not that any of these questions are new, but Tezuka's patience is endless.

(This particular thought always inspires a particularly hard jab with the bony part of his knee; he's well-acquainted with Tezuka's patience, and wishes he had more of it and Tezuka less. It'd be the same amount of patience, anyway.)

Tezuka kicks him back at the same time another faceless voice says 'Is it true that the two of you are in a relationship?'

The world freezes solid. Tezuka's voice is firm. 'No. That is merely a rumour without cause.' Ryoma's vision cracks, and he thinks he's breathing normally, but he can't be sure; it always shocks him, just a little, how easily Tezuka lies.

That night, Ryoma stretches over the side of the bed until his head touches the floor and his feet are on Tezuka's stomach and says, 'Rumour without cause, huh?' Tezuka's chest hitches under his feet, breath shuddering. Tezuka is always more open with his body language when he knows Ryoma can't see him.

'It is necessary,' he says, the same as he always does, and it's been a long time since Ryoma's been able to work up the fury to be anything but a little frustrated and a little hurt and a little intrigued. Tezuka's never explained how he learnt to lie so well, and though Ryoma's asked, Tezuka acts like he can't hear him.

'They won't care.' He sits up, almost falling off the bed. 'Why would they?' Tezuka's face pinches. 'Your grandfather has nothing to do with it.'

'It matters, Ryoma.'

'Che.' Ryoma flings himself down across Tezuka's thighs and grabs for the phone, flings it at Tezuka, who catches it. 'Go call the hospital and find out. You're useless right now.'

Tezuka's mouth takes on the wrong shape as he dials, but his hand on Ryoma's back traces forgiveness across his shoulders.

<b>Fandom</b>: Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing</b>: Tezuka/Ryoma preslash, I guess
<b>Author</b>: Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> the image of Ryoma wearing Tezuka's jacket kills me every time.
<lj-cut text=""The first time Ryoma wears Tezuka's jacket, they are the last ones in the clubroom and Tezuka is giving the clubroom a final onceover before leaving."">
The first time Ryoma wears Tezuka's jacket, they are the last ones in the clubroom and Tezuka is giving the clubroom a final onceover before leaving, checking for cats -- Ryoma's cat has sneaked in several more times during practice, for reasons that Tezuka doesn't entirely understand but suspects has something to do with the smell and feel of tennis that pervades the club and Ryoma himself -- and spies from rival schools; Hyotei's Jiroh had somehow fallen asleep inside the club, feet up inside Fuji's locker and his head on the floor, and had never explained how he had got there. Now, he checks for cats and humans and Ryoma, as much for omnipresent cans of Ponta as for the boy himself.

'Hey, buchou,' Ryoma calls. Tezuka glances over his shoulder and freezes. Ryoma has taken Tezuka's jacket from where he had folded it inside his locker and flung it around his shoulders, where it hangs loose and awkward, sleeves trailing over his hands and hem hanging around his thighs. 'What do you think?' Ryoma poses like a fashion model, then straightens and folds his arms over his chest, assuming the face Tezuka has become familiar with over the last several months as a harbinger of mockery that he dare not laugh at however much he wants to. 'Don't be careless,' Ryoma says solemnly, and ruins it by hiccuping, but recovers quickly and shifts the jacket over his shoulders. 'Is this a large?' He doesn't wait for Tezuka's answer, but twists around and the jacket is large enough on him that he can pull the collar to the front and read the label without taking it off. 'Yeah,' he answers his own question, and aims a sly look at Tezuka. 'How many laps can I give you?'

'None,' Tezuka snaps, and tugs it off; it's easy, too easy, and something in him tightens painfully as Ryoma mutters a little and leaves. It strikes him, not for the first time, with his warm jacket in his hand, how small Ryoma is, how short, child shoes and child-sized caps. If Tezuka didn't know better, he would assume Ryoma was in elementary school; and the assumption is so founded that when he forgets and for a split-second doesn't recognise Ryoma -- though it's only ever happened twice -- it's like a blow when Tezuka recognises him and sees that nothing has changed.

Ryoma or not, he is just that --

Tezuka doesn't like being reminded of this, doesn't like it at all, and his grip becomes painful after half an hour.

<b>Author</b>: Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> again, started one way and ended in another. 
<lj-cut text=""Ryoma doesn't fit in Tezuka's room at all."">
Ryoma doesn't fit in Tezuka's room at all.

He invited himself over -- how, Tezuka doesn't know exactly, it happened and all he has is the impression of Ryoma charming his parents simply by smiling, bowing, and letting them assume his sweetness, his friendliness, and the assurance <i>yes, yes of course, you may study with kuminitsu. </i>.Tezuka doesn't remember the question, but it's moot now; Ryoma is here, and he immediately disrupts Tezuka's orderliness, his bag propped against a leg of his table, chair pulled out at an angle. 'Your parents are nice,' Ryoma comments idly, crawling under the table when his elbow knocks the table and all of Tezuka's pens roll off the edge.

'What's the --' Ryoma breaks off and frowns, squashed under the table while Tezuka stands just inside his room, unsure and feeling absurdly like an intruder. Ryoma manages to fit his entire body under the table in a way Tezuka can't. He used to be able to, of course, when he was younger, and it was one of his favourite things, compressing himself into that small space and feeling protected by solid wood, braces of metal arcing into the wood and pressing into his shoulder. It felt good to have his knees shoved to his chest and his chin tucked uncomfortably over his knees, and for a moment, he envies Ryoma his smallness, birdlike and much younger than Tezuka feels.

And now that Ryoma is here, the only place Tezuka can think of for him is under the desk. It's so irrationally appropriate that if he told Fuji, Fuji would laugh and tell him that Ryoma is more than a reflection, which Tezuka knows better than Fuji does.

Still. Anything else feels wrong, and he glances helplessly at his hands as Ryoma flings pens onto the desk from underneath, grunting as he turns around and finally wriggles his way out through the side, following a wayward hand that curls itself around the leg and pulls through. Tezuka would never tell him that he used to do the exact same thing.

'Sorry,' Ryoma mutters, and for a moment, all Tezuka can do is wish that he'd met Ryoma three years ago, when he still had the words.

<b>Author's Notes:</b> this is one of the fluffiest things I have ever written. I &hearts; it, even though i strictly shouldn't. 
<lj-cut text=""It surprises him sometimes with how it right it is that Echizen leans against Tezuka and fits against him with the ease of long practice."">
It surprises him sometimes with how it right it is that Echizen leans against Tezuka and fits against him with the ease of long practice while Inui chatters long-distance through the phone held against his ear, the rightness in Echizen's amusement being as much caused by affection as exasperation with both his senpai.

The perfection in the current moment of time is the fact that they are here, together, outside a sports centre they are due to enter in six hours' time (for their match against each other, and the result is uncertain as always) and all that Echizen wants to do, amongst all the other things they could be doing, is let Tezuka hold him up.

It's gratifying and stunning every time, these small incidents that point so strongly to Echizen preferring all activities with him to anything else, up to and including matches. He sometimes wonders if Echizen ever does it on purpose, but one look at Echizen's bored expression and he discounts the idea.

Instead, he hangs up on Inui and wraps Echizen in his coat and, once Echizen is sufficiently warmed and incidentally plastered against every inch of Tezuka's body, bends to kiss him thoroughly.

He almost laughs when Echizen pulls back to complain that Tezuka's nose is cold.

<b>Author's Notes:</b> Domestic early-morning fluff. I have to say, this really is rather badly-written, and I have no excuse. 
<lj-cut text=""Tezuka still wakes up and worries that Echizen has never been real, never was real."">
Tezuka still wakes up and worries that Echizen has never been real, never was real, and that it's been an extended delusion all along; he also worries that Echizen is not there, that he is not really satisfactory for Echizen. These two worries shouldn't be able to exist simultaneously, but they do. It is only when Echizen wanders out of his bedroom still rumpled from sleep and pours himself coffee with one hand while flipping through newspapers with the other that Tezuka feels himself relax a little. 

'Buchou,' Echizen yawns, 'you always overbrew the coffee. I don't mind it, it's just-' The sentence cracks into a jaw-splitting yawn, and Echizen manouvers around Karupin to peer over Tezuka's shoulder. For the first few weeks that they lived together, the morning newspaper was a solid, fierce battle, but now they'd settled into mutal agreement. Tezuka would, as the early riser, be able to read all the sections of the newspaper first; however, when Echizen woke up and wanted to read the sports section, if Tezuka happened to have said sports section at the time, he would in no way be allowed to object to Echizen hanging shamelessly over his shoulder.

This morning Echizen is warm and sharp-boned against his back, hand on his neck and another steadying on the counter, and Tezuka wonders why he would possibly object to having Echizen so close and relaxed behind him. Even in their best moments, Echizen isn't often vulnerable like this, and Tezuka treasures it.

Then Echizen leans further over his shoulder and grabs for the sheet, pulling it out from under Tezuka's elbows in order to read it better -- Tezuka suspects that Echizen also needs glasses, if only for reading, but Echizen refuses to admit anything of the sort -- and Tezuka remembers why, as a rule, he doesn't read the tennis news last.

The kiss Echizen presses against his temple in absent-minded passing, accompanied by a murmured reassurance that his coffee really is the best in the world, outweighs his irritation.

<b>Author's Notes:</b> this was also posted in Aja's journal, but I felt it was long enough to deserve an entry of its own. Yes, I am aware that pacing is not my strong suit.
<lj-cut text=""Later, Ryoma will claim insanity or boredom or both, anything but the truth."">
Later, Ryoma will claim insanity or boredom or both, anything but the truth.

Now, he tips his head back and asks Inui, 'What'd you say the distance between buchou and everyone else is?' And of course, Inui, brows furrowed, had an answer.

But it was important to keep in mind, with Inui's answers, that they were based on averages, and probability, and percentages. Just because an answer was the most likely one didn't make it right. And answers based on uncertain things could be changed.

-

The first thing he notices is how tall Tezuka is. The second-to-last thing he notices about Tezuka is that Tezuka seemed to require a huge amount of personal space, and get it, where on the other hand, Ryoma himself liked personal space, liked more of it than was probably healthy for him, and yet Eiji and Momo took every excuse to pounce on him. It probably was because of how short he was, or that life was unfair, or both.

The spaces around Tezuka wouldn't be obvious if Eiji weren't there, Ryoma thinks, and the spaces around Tezuka wouldn't be so obvious if it weren't clear that even Fuji couldn't get that close to Tezuka, either. As soon as anyone manouvered close enough to touch him with more than a casual intention, Tezuka straightened up and went stiff and crossed his arms, and took on what Echizen thought of as buchou-face, precise and stern and uncomfortable. If you got too close to Tezuka, Tezuka did his best to edge them away - sending them off to somewhere else, moving to someone else's side, excusing himself to do this or that.

When the opportunity comes and all the others are involved in this or that fight or dogpile or commotion, Tezuka stands apart, arms folded, and utterly serious. It's hard to think of Eiji lounging on him, or Momo punching him like he does to Ryoma sometimes, or Taka clapping a hand on his shoulder. It's just unthinkable, really.

Getting close to Tezuka makes Tezuka twitchy, in a way that made it absolutely clear that if he could, he'd be twitching enough to warrant medication. Tezuka shows feelings and reactions by not feeling and not reacting, and the stronger the reaction, Ryoma has learnt, the stiller and inscrutable he gets. The times that Ryoma tried to get close, to stand next to him and feel his eyes on on the top of his head and his elbow perilously close to Ryoma's shoulder, Tezuka bore it, but so unwillingly that Ryoma found himself inventing excuses to move away.

He finds that even if he only gets as close as Fuji does, he wants to protect Tezuka from being so uncomfortable, stand guard against anyone else coming close to his captain. It's a novel feeling,thick and uncomfortable and ticklish under his ribs, and he finds that he can last five minutes before muttering about Ponta and leaving to gulp in as much air as possible.

He understands a little too much of what goes on between Fuji and Tezuka when he learns that.

There's also the occassions when he finds Tezuka in the library, apparently taking notes from some thick, complicated-looking textbook, and he tries to approach Tezuka from behind, but that same weird feeling won't let him do it and he ends up taking the long way around the table instead. When he sits down opposite Tezuka, he recieves a thoughtful glance, and Ryoma is dead sure Tezuka's noticed Ryoma waffling about, but nothing is said.

This need for space also occupies wherever Tezuka is, particularly Tezuka's room, Tezuka's locker - anything of Tezuka's is invariably left alone. Even on White Day, the gifts in his shoebox are neater and tidier and fewer than the others, as though Tezuka's precise organisation and demands for silence extends to everything that is his.

The last thing he learns about Tezuka is that all of this is perfectly true, but if someone can learn patience, then exceptions apply.

Ryoma starts to learn this when he steps forward one night and leans over Tezuka's shoulder to quip about his homework. Well, not his shoulder precisely, but the corner of Tezuka's desk, and his head is close to Tezuka's, so it counts. And though Tezuka jerks a little, or doesn't move at all, Tezuka stays where he is, and Ryoma covers for it by being rude and incidentally spilling Ponta on Tezuka's desk.

It is after that Tezuka starts keeping Ponta for him, and Ryoma learns a little more about Tezuka with every second longer, every fraction of movement Tezuka allows him to make.

He learns the smell of Tezuka's soap, the way Tezuka smells after practice, sweaty teenage boy mixed with something else that makes the smell palatable; he learns that Tezuka's hands are cold in the mornings and the way Tezuka's fingers twitch at the sports shop when he comes across something he likes. He learns the shape of Tezuka standing next to him, tall and skinny and solid, learns to be careful with where he stands or the brim of his cap will bump against the base of Tezuka's throat. He learns that Tezuka prefers chocolate and toffee icecream to almost anything else except lavender and vanilla, and learns the feel of Tezuka's knees against his thigh when they stand together on the train.

He learns that Tezuka is a reserved kisser, giving but not with a penchant for wildness. He learns that he can count Tezuka's ribs, and that if he brushes his fingers over them, Tezuka will squirm and retaliate with a precisely aimed poke at Ryoma's stomach. He learns that Tezuka will always hold the umbrella for them both and that Tezuka is terrific at billards and go but horrible at all videogames except ones involving cars.

He learns too much about himself to put into words, and learns at the same time that for Tezuka, he doesn't have to have any words but his own serve and volley and attack and defense, technique and power and concentration, all of it bracketed by <i>good game</i> and Tezuka's face across the net.

<b>Fandom:</b> Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing:</b> I dunno. Tezuka/Ryoma if you look closely?
<b>Author:</b> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> tennis really says everything in this series, doesn't it?
<lj-cut text=""Echizen requires more than one language just to say all the things he doesn't say, but only one to say everything."">
<b>first.</b>
Echizen requires more than one language just to say all the things he doesn't say, but only one to say everything.

It's the sort of thought that comes out of nowhere, assaults Tezuka with absolutely no foundation to prove it. It's not a thought Inui would have, or Fuji, or any of the others. Atobe would, but then Atobe has played Echizen at this point, and it is only when you play Echizen that this sort of thing can be learnt.

That the mention of Atobe in any relation to Echizen irritates him isn't worth thinking about, so he takes the point and goes with it. If he thinks about it a little more, Echizen and language and English and Japanese, what's said in Echizen's cap and elbows, he comes to the conclusion that Echizen could be mute and illiterate, and it wouldn't matter.

That's assuming he bothers to think about it. He doesn't at the time, but remembers it five days later at training and follows the thought as a way to distract himself.

It wouldn't matter because -

Tezuka isn't Inui. It just feels right to say: tennis and leave it at that, ungrammatical and incomplete to anyone else.

<b>second.</b>
Tezuka speaks in a language of his own, sometimes, one that's not tennis or anything he's learnt. It's a fragile little language, a dialect of Echizen's doing, but it's growing and he can feel it smiling inside of him, bonding with what he is to have him become something uncertain and greater.

It's composed of what he says in wristbands and intensity and practicing the occassional strange-feeling smile in the train window; what he feels when Echizen discovers something new and greater in himself, his pride in Seigaku, in all of them. It breaks and stretches inside him, pushes him a little off-balance. He feels more confident than he did before, and at the same time more uncertain. Tezuka accepts this as a simple question of balance.

<b>last.</b>
Give this new development a year, he thinks, and he just might dare to laugh in practice, in truth, instead of the occassional chuckle inside his mind.

He'd like to think that Echizen would laugh, if he laughed.

If he did, they would react like so: Eiji would think he had been replaced with some other strange creature, of course, and drape himself over someone, and Kawamura would worry and rub his neck, and Oishi would ask him if he were alright, and Kaidoh would look at him like the world had wobbled off course, and Fuji would smile with his eyes open, and Momo would dive into excited conference with Eiji. More data for Inui, but Tezuka suspects that Inui would spare him the sort of smile that was rarer than Fuji's honest one before Inui thought wrote anything down. He knows this, knows this of them.

But even so, he likes to think that Echizen would, after the customary <i>is buchou crazy</i> moment, understand and laugh with him in the midst of it all.

<b>Title:</b> untitled #002
<b>Fandom:</b> Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing:</b> Tezuka/Ryoma. Again. 
<b>Author:</b> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> this started somewhere and ended up somewhere else. as what happens pretty much all the time.
<lj-cut text=""'Buchou told me to tell you that Ryuzsaki-sensei wants to talk to you.'"">
The first sign that something is wrong comes one afternoon when Eiji bounces over to where he is stretching and says 'Buchou told me to tell you that Ryuzsaki-sensei wants to talk to you.' Ryoma glances over to Tezuka and Inui standing by the fence. Inui seems to be doing a lot of talking, but Tezuka is too, and Inui doesn't look happy.

'Why didn't he tell me himself?' If Eiji is intimidating when they are standing, he is even more unnerving when he's leaning over Ryoma, hands on hips and beaming. 'No idea. Inui's not letting him get anywhere, nya.' Ryoma nods and lets it go, and Eiji wanders off to Oishi.

When did Tezuka stop looking at him?

The second sign is when Fuji pauses in the middle of practice and gives him a thoughtful look that wasn't along the lines of Fuji's usual consideration, but more puzzled, like he couldn't figure something out. It's not a good sign for him when it comes down to it. A curious Fuji -- curious enough to let him know he was curious, and not in a way that said he was plotting something -- was a rare enough thing that Ryoma became very careful to say and do as little as possible.

The third is when Inui pulls out a notbook that has more tape along the spine than the rest of them and says 'Calculated height difference: precisely twenty-eight centimetres.' and Ryoma doesn't have to ask who he's talking about. Somehow, that fact catches him by the ear and jerks him around until he's looking up at Inui, who looks back and continues, 'He will have to bend approximately thirty degrees. I recommend sitting down.' It's horrifying and relieving all at once that Inui knows, and he knows that Inui's helping in Inui-fashion, but still. Inui knows.

Somehow the mildly sympathetic expression on Inui's face is even worse.

The fourth is when he passes Sanada on some random street on some random day and some impulse tells him to open his mouth before his brain can overrule the idea and say 'How did you deal with Yukimura?' Sanada's face stiffens, and Ryoma watches the glimpse of panic snap off Sanada's face to reveal nothing.

'I was careful,' Sanada says at last, and not for the first time, Ryoma admires his voice, deep and steady. 'But it was more within his control than mine.' Then, 'Captains are often difficult when they are not easily persuaded.'

'But what do you do when they won't even look at you?' Sanada's face arranges itself into something like humour, except that it's Sanada.

'You're asking about the beginning.'

Ryoma nods carefully. 'What happened first?'

'The first thing,' and it's more thoughtful than anything else, 'was when he defeated me in a match.' Ryoma watches Sanada's face carefully, and nods at the answers there. 'Echizen?'

'What?'

'We never had this conversation.'

The fifth sign is when Tezuka is on his doorstep at half seven on a Wednesday night looking harassed and tired and too much like a salaryman. 'Echizen. Ryuszaki-sensei requested that this be handed to you.' There's a bunch of paper in his hands, and he's not sure if he took it from Tezuka or if Tezuka put it in his hands or maybe both.

'Buchou?' Tezuka waits, and it's the sort of visual trick that only Tezuka can pull off successfully, that sense of <i>you are wasting my time</i>.

'What is it, Echizen?' Ryoma tries to think of something to say that doesn't sound ridiculous.

'Play a match with me.'

The sixth and final sign is when Tezuka is standing on the court, objections running across his face without needing to be said <i>homework council duties paperwork tests sleep</i>, and he lets Ryoma pull him down and kiss him.

'Thanks,' Ryoma mutters, and hastily moves away to his side of the court, but he can already feel the pull of having touched-kissed Tezuka once, and wanting to do it again. There's something addictive and powerful about being that close to Tezuka, not necessarily kissing him but just having touched him.

Tezuka's eyes are very clear and Ryoma's stomach is complaining when it comes to game and match, and Ryoma's worries fall into place at the sound of Tezuka's bag being hoisted. 'Don't send messengers, buchou.'

'Don't involve Sanada, Echizen.'

'Che.'

<b>Title:</b> untitled #003
<b>Fandom:</b> Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing:</b> eventual Tezuka/Ryoma.
<b>Author:</b> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> Fuji is evil. 
<lj-cut text=""The first time Ryoma is given a box to stand on in photographs, the others snicker and shrug and point to Fuji."">
The first time Ryoma is given a box to stand on in photographs, the others snicker and shrug and point to Fuji, who calmly took a photograph without the box,and then with, and showed the two results to him with the sense of a foregone conclusion. Despite all the arguments Ryoma can think of, the box becomes a fixture in the clubhouse, and he's merely grateful that there aren't very many photographs taken that require him to be standing with the others.

Of course, it doesn't help much at tournaments, so he scowls and ensures that he is standing with Inui and Tezuka. They make anyone look short, and if he has to be short, then he'll be short.

It works for a while, until Inui comments that he's gotten taller and that the optical trick won't work anymore, and Ryoma finds that if he stands next to Eiji and Oishi instead, he can appear just a little below average.

Then he grows again, and by this time he has to buy another jacket and opponents mutter that they heard he was shorter, and he can stand with Kaidoh and Momo as a buffer of indifference.

In the end, Inui's chin rests comfortably on his head and Fuji can't claim that Ryoma is too short for Tezuka anymore.

Neither can Tezuka.

<b>Fandom:</b> Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing:</b> Fuji-matchmaker {sort of); implied TezuRyo
<b>Author:</b> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> I seem to have a run of Fuji-POV TezuRyo lately. I imagine this one to be set about five years after Tezuka's left Seigaku, and for Tezuka and Fuji to be first-year university students (why that is... well, that is another fic altogether). As always, unbeta'ed; and as always, for Aja. 
<lj-cut text=""He glances up and across at Tezuka, about to ask regarding a certain formula Tezuka grasps better than he does, and pauses..."">
<hr>
He glances up and across at Tezuka, about to ask regarding a certain formula Tezuka grasps better than he does, and pauses. Tezuka's expression has a particular brooding, curious look to it, and his face is turned all angles and curves and his eyes are so bright, knife edge bright, and it's painfully obvious who Tezuka's thinking about. 

'Tezuka.' Tezuka's head moves a little, his eyes glance towards Fuji; but the look is still there, it is not Fuji or the cupboards behind him that Tezuka is looking at, and Fuji sets down his cup of tea, shifts his weight, smiles. 'You can't stop, can you?' The look is gone, then, and Tezuka straightens, looks squarely across the table at him, cheap overhead light casting frames onto his glasses, his left hand flat on top of the cracked table. 'No.' 

'Just go find him,' Fuji advises, holding back irritation, the urge to defend Tezuka to himself; it won't do any good, it'll make things worse. Then, sharply, just as sharp as Fuji intends -- to get Tezuka to do anything, you have to hurt him -- 'What are you waiting for?' 

Tezuka takes a quick breath that catches in his throat, leans back and folds his arms across his chest. Fuji sways closer, watches Tezuka breathe for a moment before continuing; his breath smells like tea and pity. 'Here.' He unfolds the paper in his hand, puts it on the table with a finger on top so Tezuka can't take it and throw it away as Tezuka will inevitably do if Fuji lets him. 'His address, his phone number. I called him.' Tezuka's eyes narrow, and Fuji can see the ghost of <i>forty laps</i> on his tongue, but he is no longer buchou, they are no longer part of Seigaku, and Fuji was never his in the first place. 'He asked after you,' he says, and it's like he's answered a prayer; Tezuka's chin softens, and there's something like hope in the twist of his hands, and Fuji thinks: <i>Finally.</i> 

'Call him,' and it's Fuji's blessing and Tezuka's release, and Tezuka's hand is flat over the paper and Fuji's scrawled handwriting -- he had repeated his details three times, two of those unnecessary, just to make sure Fuji had everything correct -- as he looks across at Fuji. Fuji flicks at the back of Tezuka's hand and kisses him a final time, presses his lips to Tezuka's cheek. Fuji can feel Tezuka withdraw from him, feels their existence togther crash and burn and take Fuji with it, and knows that it's the right thing to do, the only thing to do. 

As Fuji packs, he can imagine perfectly the stance that Tezuka is in now, Tezuka standing in the hall in front of the phone on the creaky board and shifting his weight, crrrrreeeekcriicreeeekcriicreeek, and staring at the paper crinkled in his hand; just as he does every other time Fuji does this, finds a phone number and an address and presses it on Tezuka, Oishi or Eiji or Taka. And just as he does every other time, he will be himself again, himself being Tezuka-buchou. Tezuka can never be anything else, and to pretend otherwise is delusion. 

This is the first time it's been Echizen's information on the paper, and it's the last piece of knowledge that Fuji has to give. 

He packs away his photos, his albums, takes all of them except the ones of Seigaku and Echizen, sweeps his clothes and shoes into a bag, unhurried as Tezuka's British-accented Japanese English drifts under the door, shifts to easy, familiar Japanese. Fuji walks past, bag in hand; he's never kept much at Tezuka's flat anyway, never bothered to, always knowing that someday he'd leave like this, and Tezuka blinks at him, then understands in the fraction of a second it takes for Fuji to lean forwards and say into the reciever, 'Echizen, remember, buchou needs planting in a sunny spot and watering every morning.'

Echizen's mutter of 'Fuji-senpai...' is familiar, as is the look on Tezuka's face -- exactly as Fuji has imagined it for years -- as Fuji smiles with his eyes closed and leaves, Tezuka's happiness flaring in his mind, illuminating and not entirely welcome in its scorching brightness. 

He can imagine Echizen's voice. <i>Buchou, are you there?</i>

He can hear Tezuka's response, quiet and certain. 'I'm here,' and it's finally the truth.

<b>Fandom:</b> Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing:</b> Tezuka/Ryoma through Fuji POV
<b>Author:</b> Lindra <lj user=lindrawrites>
<b>Author's Notes:</b> Originally written as a comment to Aja as a bribe, which was then refused, and as the idea was already half-written, turned into a present instead. Massively unbeta'ed, like everything else I post. 
<lj-cut text=""Tezuka is to Fuji is as Fuji is to cactus..."">
<hr>
Tezuka is to Fuji is as Fuji is to cactus. It's not the best analogy in Fuji's mind. The fact remains that Tezuka fills a very specific purpose in Fuji's life -- one that he seems to take without complaint -- and Fuji fills an important role in Tezuka's life. It works, somehow. It's one of the more surprising things that came out of when they first met; that the arrangement, on the whole, works.

When Fuji calls Tezuka, he knows that Tezuka will hang up on him if he asks Tezuka logical but idiotic questions -- as, say, Inui does -- so it's much better to talk, back and forth, around and through and under a topic, and then toss in an illogical, reasonable question that smacks of Yumiko's perception being a familial inheritance.

It'll be the kind of question that doesn't require words, just the change in Tezuka's breathing, changes in his voice and presence and how Fuji can hear his hand shift on the reciever.

Tezuka is to Fuji as squares are to circles. To Fuji's mind, it's prettier when the squares are inside the circles, and that is exactly where Tezuka ends up being. It's useful knowledge, in a sort of desultory this-is-how-it-is way.

Lately, though, Echizen.

Echizen.

And now Tezuka's hand clenches in time to <i>echizen ryoma echizen ryoma</i> when Fuji mentions him -- he doubts that Tezuka notices, but then again maybe he does -- and Tezuka is stacked inside Fuji's grasp and Ryoma is a long, straight line down the middle of Tezuka's square, with no beginning or end except Tezuka himself. And the rest of the team, orbiting them without knowing.

But Echizen dived right to the centre of their formation, where he is safe and he never loses (except to Sanada, and once; Fuji pried that particular fact out of Kawamura one night, and was almost glad) and Fuji knows that Echizen knows that as long as Echizen is Tezuka's to hold and guard and protect and above all shove forward like a parent at the end of his tether (and Tezuka wears out his tether a lot when it comes to Echizen), Fuji will not harm him.

Not seriously. Not in the spirit of, say, Kirihara, or Mizuki. Not in that sense of needing to defend and protect against physical harm. He's always had a particular soft spot for Tezuka, for captains that lead by example and faith (tezuka) (tachibana) -- but it's Tezuka that concerns him now, Tezuka's need is a little too strong, a little too desperate, for Fuji's taste, and so Fuji does his best to blur the edges. Blunt edges cause the most pain and damage, but they are slower, and he hopes that Echizen will realise this before Tezuka is hurt. 

Fuji will watch and wait and make ridiculously insightful comments at and to Tezuka late at night while Tezuka does his history homework, and he enjoys listening to Tezuka's breath jump, the sudden screech of his pen. Fuji will watch and needle Echizen ever so slightly until Echizen raises his cap and glares, but he will do nothing beyond that.

Really, it was his own fault, pure and simple. Fuji's fault that Tezuka was so intrigued, so easily snared by Echizen

<i>(he'd set up that particular failing a long time ago by thoroughly disappointing Tezuka at every opportunity when it came to displaying his skill, and it was more fun than he'd had in the previous year)</i>

and his fault that Echizen was attatched to Tezuka for most of practice and games in his constant unconscious efforts to make Tezuka smile however he could

<i>(also his fault; Fuji had informed Tezuka, halfway through their second year, that Tezuka was irresistible when he smiled, so now Tezuka did his best not to and in retrospect, punning on the Tezuka Zone that had been in action at the time was a bad idea)</i>.

In a way, Fuji was like -- no, Fuji <i>was</i> the circle around them, the square and the line without beginning or end. And like the circle that bound them all, he did his best to hold Tezuka and Echizen together, just because it was more fun to see them together than apart -- although their being apart for a little while every so often was an excellent opportunity to drop cryptic remarks and watch them both stiffen and try to hide the fact that they'd reacted at all, Tezuka succeeding much better than Echizen -- and, well, it was better for them anyway. 

Besides, this way, he got to take pictures and drop them in their lockers every so often when they weren't looking.

Just to remind them that he was there.

<b>Fandom:</b> Prince of Tennis
<b>Pairing:</b> Tezuka/Ryoma
<b>Author:</b> Lindra (<lj user=lindrawrites>)
<b>Author's Notes:</b> Thanks to <lj user=bookshop> for dragging me into the fandom; thanks to <lj user=boldsirrobin> for the once-over. This was written very, very quickly; I estimate about fifteen-twenty minutes in total, and was originally meant to be a drabble, but it spiraled. 

For Aja. &hearts;

<lj-cut text=""Some days, Tezuka's hair is one of the most annoying things in the world...""> <hr>
Some days, Tezuka's hair is one of the most annoying things in the world. 

It sticks up all over the place, but it doesn't. It's flat, and it's upright, and it's not, and there's the occassional thought somewhere that Tezuka's morning hair must be <i>fantastic</i>, but he shoves that idea away without too much difficulty. (It still nags, though, when he sees Tezuka with a towel around his neck. If he dared to reach up and throw it over Tezuka's head and <i>scrub</i>...) 

And today, it is especially annoying, because the ends stick out and tickle his nose and the skin between his eyebrows, and being tickled makes kissing difficult, given that Ryoma's internal response is for his stomach to curdle and his face to go perfectly blank. Neither of these things help kissing, and eventually, he shoves Tezuka's face away and grabs for some paperclips off Tezuka's desk. 'Echizen--' 

'Hold still,' Ryoma mutters, and he's aware that he's crawling all over Tezuka, that his knees must be digging into Tezuka's thighs and hurting an awful lot, and if he slipped, Tezuka would be extremely angry at him. He's also aware of Tezuka's minute, puzzled confusion (don't look at his eyebrows for that, look at his eyes, the angle of his wrists in his pockets) and of the fact that when Ryoma told him to hold still, he held still immediately and without another word. It's a wonder of the world. 

He's finished, eventually, and when he wriggles his way back into his awkward place on Tezuka's lap, Tezuka looks startled and faintly annoyed and Tezuka with a forehead is a new look, Ryoma thinks, and it's not the best job ever, but it's enough. Ryoma leans in to kiss Tezuka, but is stopped by a hand on his shoulder. 

'What?' He's impatient now; his lips are getting cold. 

'Did you just decorate my hair with paperclips?' His voice is very careful, as though <i>what on earth has Echizen done </i>now<i>?</i> has been taken to another level, and it probably has. 

'It was getting in the way.' This time, Ryoma does kiss him, and Tezuka makes no attempt to stop him, and he can taste confusion and the the faint withdrawl that means Tezuka's not paying attention. He knocks on the side of Tezuka's head. 'Stop thinking,' he scolds, and Tezuka murmurs something about laps, and starts to voice another question. 'Echizen--' 

'Thinking!' Ryoma cuts him off with a squirm in his lap, pulls Tezuka closer. 'I told you, stop thinking.' He presses a hard kiss to his mouth. 'Do it tomorrow,' he adds and finishes, and this kiss is Tezuka's lead, and Ryoma follows eagerly. 

(Definitely paying attention now, and Ryoma can tell by how both arms are pulling him close, can tell by the expression in Tezuka's eyes, the plea in how his spine arches into Ryoma's hands.) 

Tezuka's expression the next morning at practice when Fuji's smile is broader and more secrective than usual is wary and exasperated, and his expression when he discovers Kaidoh and Inui hastily conferring in the locker room is one that orders them onto the courts, <i>now</i>. 

But best of all is the threat of payback in his face when Eiji points out the last paperclip clinging to the back of his hair and he fails to react, just calmly picks it out and puts it in his pocket and orders twenty laps like it's an afterthought. A little later, in the middle of Ryoma's twelfth lap, he directs his glare at Ryoma, narrows his eyes and tilts his jaw and promises <i>it will be your turn</i> with every line of his body, and Ryoma returns it with <i>i'll be waiting</i>. 

Tezuka stops him at the end of practice, stops him by coming up behind him and Ryoma turns around before anything is said; Tezuka measures Ryoma with his eyes like he does every time he sees him, and tosses the paperclip at him. Ryoma catches it easily and stares up at his captain. 'Buchou?' 

'Return it to me later,' is all he says, and he walks away with Fuji (he's convinced for half a second that Fuji knows, convinced, and then when Fuji's face turns away, he's not so sure anymore, but he can still see that smile in front of him). 

It's an invitation, it's challenge and anticipation, and it's so like Tezuka it <i>hurts</i>. It goes without saying that Tezuka will bring the balls, Ryoma will bring himself (and the paperclip), and for a little while, nothing else will matter. 

He doesn't need to answer Tezuka, with words or anything else. They both already know, and by the next month, the paperclip is brittle from being passed back and forth between them, heavy with newly formed tradition and all the things left unsaid.</lj-cut>"

College begins August 23rd. I'm rather excited, yet my mom is making it depressing. My older brother dropped out in highschool and never went to go get his GED, but he has learned his mistakes and now paying the price. However he has managed to keep a job well over six years and now has a beautiful baby girl named Kennedi, so he has become a responsible and determined young man. Hehe. Anyway, mom whispered into my ear on graduation night that I was her inspiration. For some odd reason whenever I see my mom or even think about her, those words repeat in my mind again and again. I will be the first college student in my entire family; including aunts and uncles, etc. Yes, I'm proud but I'm not attending college for them and to be the first and such, I'm attending college for my sake and my sake alone. I am determined to become successful, in whatever that may be, and so I will reach for the stars --- for my dream is to become an Astronaut. May God have mercy upon those who stand in my way."

Yesterday I went to NSU in Tahlequah, the university I will be attending this coming fall. I had to retake an Accuplacer Test on the reading comprehension, otherwise I'll have to take a 0-level college class that isn't a credit. Well.. go figure, I failed again. You have to make at least a 75% and I made a 72% -- missed two questions. T_T  Forget it, I'll just take the class. But I guess I could try and retake it again in 30 days. Ugh, not even in college and all ready am I sick of it. I miss school, though. Yeah, I like school. It provided entertainment. And damn, aren't there a bunch of liberals at my school. >D  I'd get into a debate with the students and teachers at least twice a week, or whenever something happens. I decided to take political science this coming semester since it is a political year.<br><br>
BTW, hear up on the American that was killed? I don't think any American civilian should be there, but that's my opinion. Should we have released the prisoners to save him? If we did, would our soldiers be in more danger? Gimme your opinion on it. I'm interested in what you have to say.<br><br>
Oh! Go visit Mel -- (www.livejournal.com/users/melable). I made a layout for her LJ, but go show her some lovin'. Kk? Kk. Want me to make you a layout? Contact me. And yes, I made the layout you see here. Like it? Outstanding if you do. Okay if you don't.<br><br>
Later."

I will randomly upload new layouts until I am satisfied. Would you like me to make you one? Email me, then. Tell me what you want on it, colours, words, etc. If there's a particular image, please email it to me so I won't have to search the i'net. =/ Spanka-Spanka.<br>
Take care now, bye bye then."

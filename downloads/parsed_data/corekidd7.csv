"event","Today was a very great day cause I got to go on my first date with Tiffany. we went to souhgate cinema and saw ""the ring"" even though I saw it allready I still loved every minute sitting there with Tiffany watching it holding her hand. :)

Tiffany even though you said you liked the day I feel bad cause I dident talk much it's just when im around you in person I get nervous and get butterflys in my stomach like a shy person getting ready to speak infront of a audience. I love you soooooo much and I nervous cause you complete me and I never wanna loose you.

Even though im so bad with directions and couldent find you, but I found you after being lost for a bit lol. even though I felt like a dumb ass being lost its ok.

Me and Mike give it 2 thumbs up...heh, then after I droped mike off at home I went home and ate and got ready for the dance, then after that I picked up Mmike again to go the dance.

Then we the pimps left to our dance lol, we got there and we were very early but oh well we waited. And then miek got free keychaine pictures cause he was soooo damn sexy so said the camera man LOL.

"event","The first day I saw you was the beging to my down fall,
not only did I let you into my life, but I made you my pride and joy
But now it's diffrent your not that sweet innocent girl I feel for,
your emotions have descived me for I thought we had something special,
something deeper, but you gave that feeling all away for lies that you 
took in and belived. Now I sit her locked away in my emotions as I 
decide your worth going through all the bullshit....Will this torement
ever end? Must you keep pushing this one step further? In the end all will 
be decided and I will be left alone traped in my pool of emotions. And 
still I will be haunted with these painful memories...."

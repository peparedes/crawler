"event","I'm legit sick to my stomach. I never want to leave my bedroom again. sometimes my legs dont want to work..my knees buckle, and i fall. I feel most alive when i'm vulnerable. 

I just saw the most gorgeous girl today. I almost threw up. I'm not pretty. I fooled myself into thinking i was actually ""ok""&nbsp;looking.&nbsp;in reality i'm a fucking fat ass. My outgoing personality disguises the hurt i constantly feel, people only&nbsp;talk to me cuz i'm the funny, perverted&nbsp;fat girl. 

I wish i was different. I wish I was beautiful. I wish I could fall asleep without crying...the hardest..when I'm having someone staying over..or I'm sleeping away from him..silently. the tears fall.. hard and steady. 

i cant handle this anymore. I'm going to sleep."

"event","my own beating heart is my worst tragedy. 

Sometimes i feel like I'm just wandering around trying to find a place where i belong. 
Sometimes i feel like i found that place. 
Sometimes i feel like my search is never going to end. 

Guess what..I went and did it again. I went and threw my heart away..on a superstar. HA. im so predictable its disgusting. 
I tell myself over and over and over..""dont get too involved you're gonna end up heartbroken. fuck Kate dont do it again"" 

and like a fucking dog chasing its tail i go ahead and do it again. I'd probably be better off just being ammune to all feelings..happy; sad; scared 

I gotta play this off like its all alright. I gotta play it off like i dont care. gotta brush off my shoulder and keep on trekking. 
Sometimes i feel like my heart is suffocating me. Its hard to explain the the pain is so vivid. 

I just wish you actually cared an ounce. a fucking gram. 

i suck at life. =)"

why I lie about you, because of all this pain 
You were never there for me and i doubt you ever will 
I feel so empty deep inside, no love could ever fill 
I dont remember much of you, memories fade away 
you will never be my father, there's nothing more to say 

Well daddy dear, now you know that this is my ode to you 
running away from what you did i can never forgive you. 
I know you'll never get this..So go on with your life 
with me as some distant memory."

this..this is where I want to be. Somewhere where the sun is setting and the night life is just pounding to come alive. 
 California. Thats where I belong. Where the boys are just as gorgeous as the girls.

I'm California Dreaming HxC! I want to go there so bad. Just for a little while. Just to live the life I've dreamt of. To live some place where you arent judged by the way you dress, but for the way you act..California...my heart is with you."

"event","So today I decided to get a new live journal. I didn't really use the old one because I hated my user name. I got a different account, so now I can post voice posts on this. Ha ha I'll probably end up doing that more often than not because I'm lazy as shit. Also, I have decided to finally cut of meat from my diet. I have wanted to for a while, I was just to naive about it. Well now I've done research, and it seems that if I follow a simple yet, nutritious diet, I can live a good healthy life without meat! 

My graduation party is on saturday..and I have the worst feeling that most of the ""friends"" I invited won't show up. It would be nice if they told me, I know a couple that told me already that they can't come, but the people who haven't said a word to me about the party since I gave them an invite...come on! Totally not cool.

Well I'm gonna go, because my sunburn kills. <3


peace love and chicken wings;;

Today is tuesday so this weekend what did i do? Friday had to work till close then 
went to Husson and partied it up with my sb balla girls, that was really fun. 

Saturday had to work 1-9:30 then went to see ""Butterfly Effect"" with the girls.  It was the second time I've seen it, but it's such a good movie...I love it!!

Sunday got called in to work at around noon time, had to stay till close around 5ish.  Then came home and just kinda hungout around here.

Monday went to classes and practice, bout the extent of it.

Then today went to my one class and got my test back, I got an 88 so I was excited.  Came back here after class around 915ish, just kinda chilled out and layed down for a bit.  Had to go to the doctor's at 1 for a check up on my wrist. Everything seems to be going pretty good, just a little sore from all the throwing and all that shit in softball.  After I got home from the docs I went running. Then went to practice at 330-530.  Went and ate at the dinning commons with sb girls, then manzo, jenna, and i studied for chem...had to call in the reinforcements though.  So now I'm home and just kinda hanging out, prolly going to get to bed at a reasonable hour tonight so I can get some sleep before that terrible chem test tomorrow morning.Plus I'm extremely tired right now!  So that's about the extent of my day, real boring I know...but what can ya do.

Only 3 more days of classes and 7 more days until florida!! (Can't wait!!)  That's it for now...later.

"event","So it's been a little while since I last wrote, but there really isn't a whole lot to say...let's see...

Softball's starting to get into full swing, and it's going pretty so far. We leave for Florida in 10 days. I can't wait, I need to get outta here, BAD!! It should be really fun though, most of the girls on the team are really cool...and the ones that aren't I try and stay clear of.

I can't wait to go to New Hampshire for the summer.  It's going to be so great to get out of here for 2 months, and the job should be pretty sweet too. I think I just need a change of pace for awhile.

But anyway, that's about all I have to say for now.

"event","Yea, so it's been kind of a long time since I've updated, but it's all good.  Been really busy lately with school, softball getting into full swing and working all weekend long.

So lets see, this weekend...friday I worked from 3-930, then when I got out Rosin came and picked me up and we went to her house and watched Requim for a Dream(what a fucked up movie), then we fell asleep. Woke up at 730 saturday morning and we both had to work till 6 (long ass day), then my mom took us out to dinner, then we went to her sister's house, then she brought me home. And today...had to get up real early to get my car out of the driveway, so now I'm just kinda hanging out until I have to go to work at 930.

I can't wait for this summer!! It's really not too far away though, I have 2 weeks then it's spring break (FLORIDA!!).  Then when we get back from that we only have 8 weeks of school left.  So I'll be out May 12th, then a month of hanging out around here and working....Then I'm off to New Hampshire for 2 months...I can't wait!!! I really just wanna get outta here.

Well that's all for now, try to stay up with it a little better.

Later all

"event","Wow, this weekend was one that I never want to experience again.  I just don't understand why some stuff happens.  It just doesn't seem fair.  I just feel so bad for my family, my mom is having a rough time with all this and I know the rest of the family is beside themselves.

Finally got to see Andrew tonight, it was really good just riding around and talking like usual.  I think we both really needed...actually I know we both really needed it. He's seriously my best friend, I don't know what I'd do without him.  It made everything a little bit easier to deal with having him to talk to.  It's so great to have a friend like that, one that I can talk to about absolutely everything.

Well I'm going to try to get some sleep, gotta get up early for a chem test. We'll see how it goes.

"event","Went to lab at 12:30 then went to work, got there about 2:30. It was me and Rosin for the whole night. We were so dead it was ridiculous, it's ok though, we bought some cards and some nice little kids crossword puzzles for the dollar store to keep up occupied.  Always a fun time!

I'm going to go get my hair cut tomorrow, I'm not sure what I should do with it though...I kinda wanna get it cut kinda short.  I dunno...I'll have to find something, all I know is I wanna do something different with it.

Well I guess today wasn't such a bad day. Kinda weird, people just popping up everywhere, didn't really know how to react to that, but whatever.  I mean I guess if they are going to put the effort forward I could.  I'm just a little apprehensive, I'm not up for getting burned by a friend again.  It was bad enough the first time, and I'm not sure if that's the type of friendship I wanna be in. But I guess I can atleast she what it is they wanna say before I make up mind completely.  We'll see how it goes I guess.

Well I'm outta here, had a late one last night...
It was soo fun though!!

"event","Didn't go to my first class today because I didn't get home from the show at ushies until like 1:45 this morning.  It was fucking awesome though.  All the band did so good and Paranoid Social Club was amazing.  I had so much fun with Rosin!! I'm so tired now, gotta go to lab in about 5 mins, prolly won't get outta there until 2:20, then I think I'm going to grab some lunch with Rosin before we have to go spend the remainder of our day at work! Not a good time, at all!

As for my whole new outlook on life, it lasted a couple days. Not long enough, I just can't help it...things just piss me off so much.  I'm so sick of being around here, I can't wait to get outta here for the summer, it's going to be so great! Only 4 more months of this shit to get through and then I'm outta here for 2 months...Thank God!! 

Well I'm going to get to chem lab, then to work. Have a great day!

"event","So my day started off when I woke up at 7:59 and I was supposed to be at class at 8...oops!! Regardless I didn't go to that class and it was my only one for the day, so I went back to bed and proceeded to be lazy for the rest of the day.  Until about 2, went and got some lunch then to work for the rest of the night! Soo dead, as usual!

As for everything that was going on for the past week it hasn't necessarily gotten better, but I've decided the attitude I should have towards it is FUCK IT! It's really not worth getting myself all stressed out about.  Because seriously, what is the point?! Things are going to happen no matter what, if I get myself all stressed it's really not going to change the fact of whatever's going on. So anyway, that's my new outlook on the whole situation.

Anyway...I'm going to watch some tv and get to bed, maybe I'll wake up on time for classes tomorrow, we'll see...

"event","So, I just got out of work. It was kinda crazy cause of the whole pats thing. Made for a bit of a long day on top of my 5 classes. But hey that's alright.

I don't know what's been up but this week has been so shitty. Don't you hate it when you think you know people and they just say and do things that are so outrageous? What's up with that anyway...and why's it all coming at the same time? Seriously?! I just don't know anymore, it's all just getting a bit ridiculous.

Anyway...it'd just be nice if things would start going a little better, just seems like it's all been going downhill for awhile, why is that do you suppose??

I guess I'll figure it out eventually..."

"event","I don't understand how he can get that pissed at me for something that I'm doing when he's doing the same exact thing.  It's not fair to tell me he's pissed at me becasue I didn't call when he didn't call either.  He says he thought he meant enough to me for me to call him, what does that mean I don't mean enough to him for him to call me? Cause that's sure what it sounds like...SERIOUSLY, that's a little ridiculous. Whatever, I don't even want to deal with it anymore."

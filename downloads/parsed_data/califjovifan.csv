"event","My new celebrity crush is Jeremy Piven. He's cute, smart, wickedly funny and Jewish! Could two people overcome their fundemental ideas of who is the savior of the world?

Even worse, Piven is possibly superficial. When I requested to be his friend on his personal myspace page, I was denied! I don't have a profile pic up so maybe that's it! Maybe he's heard I am a stalker! Don't know! I should put Shelley's cute picture up as my profile and see if he approves me then! LOL! 

Actors.......musicians.....why am I attacted to the superficially self-absorbed?? Even my fantasy men are all about them! Geez!"

"event","You ever had that experience where you say something before you can think about it and then are left wondering where the heck that came from?? I had that experience this morning. I offered to babysit for a 10-year old! It isn't the offer itself that has me baffled. I have babysat for many friends and even taught 2nd and 3rd grade Sunday School. It was who I made the offer to that had me shaking my head and wondering what God was doing! The offer was made to Jeff. His squeeze has a 10-year old and needs to find a babysitter! 

Jeff FINALLY formally introduced Cathy and I this weekend and, damn her, she is totally sweet! ARRRRGHHH! I was enjoying hanging out but my friend was pressuring me to leave so we didn't stay long! Too bad! I mentioned that I would love to hang out again the weekend of the 8th as that would be my last hurrah as a Health Net employee and Jeff's Cathy agreed that would be fun! 

So with that introduction and quick hang, this has been brought full circle. I learned that Cathy is a sweetheart and I am truly happy that they are talking about moving to Nashville together to help him establish his career as a songwriter. **gulp**. Ok...that last one is going to take some time to come to grips with! But it was nice to get that meeting over with and to no longer feel uncomfortable being around her, not knowing what to say or what was said about me! I feel that I can go to a gig and walk up to her with no problem and chat! If Jeff would have done this months ago, think what could have been avoided!

I forgive him. Knowing when to forgive is part of the learning and growing process. What made this so incredibly difficult is that it wasn't Jeff I had to forgive. It was me! Forgiving Jeff for the total clusterf*** he made of this situation was easy! Forgiving myself for my part in it was the hardest! I kept rehashing the last year and finding situations where I see the things I said or did wrong. The thing that I keep losing sight of is that nothing happens by chance. This mess of a situation happened just as it was planned to happen. As long as learning took place among the tears and heartache, it wasn't a wasted experience. 

Through Band Boy I learned not to lose myself in a guy! I learned that no one should get between me and my best girlfriends...not even a guy! I learned the importance of two-way honest communication and how humor can be used to difuse a situation. And most importantly, I learned how quick you can get wrapped up in what you think a person/situation is and lose sight of reality! 

Reality bites! I am seeing this friendship for the first time as it truly is! Reality is that Jeff and I would probably kill each other. He's way too moody and sensitive not to mention opinionated...oh, wait...that's me!  As a boyfriend/girlfriend he and I would make great co-workers :) Reality is that I am upset for not having anyone, not him specifically! I am happy for him, really I am! He and Cathy have probably been working on this relationship for well over a year and are serious. Good for him and God help her! LOL! 

So good bye to the figment of my imagination that was Band Boy! Hello to my friend Jeff, my new friend Cathy and my acceptance for my being single...still!

"event","Man! 3:30AM! I can't sleep! Duckie (the little Bishon I am dogsitting) and I have made pasta for my lunch and a pot of coffee! I have to be up in an hour and a half so why go back to sleep now! 

I can't get band boy (little b's on purpose) out of my head! I just keep replaying my birthday weekend and mentally kick myself for over reacting! If I hadn't did what I did and said what I said, would our friendship be different today? Was our friendship what I thought it to be in the first place? NOOOO! He had a ""fan""! He was getting off on the fact I adored him! I was in love with someone that I thought had integrity, that I thought was decent! Instead, he turned out to be a musician like all others: self-serving, ego-driven, goes out of his way to make sure evero

Why can't I get it through my head that the reason he got defensive every time I cornered him on the basis of our friendship is that he KNEW he was scaming me! He KNEW he was working on a relationship with the squeeze! That's why he would insist on only emails and the ocassional phone call! That's why he did a Dancing With The Stars worthy tango every time I invited him to go out with my friends and I! That's why he didn't do the same with Elida and her friends...because they are friends with the squeeze!! Why didn't I listen to my inner voice when it told me he was hiding behind this ""busy schedule""? Ahhh crap! The friends he told me were asking about his birthday while I was planning his party??? IT WAS THE SQUEEZE AND HER BUDDIES!!!!! He lied by ommission the entire time we were ""friends"" I am willing to bet so why do I keep beating myself up over this???

I guess the question is: WHY DO I CARE NOW???? Well,  it's PMS week and this is what happens! Am I doomed to keep reliving this doomed ""friendship"" EVERY PMS week for the rest of my life??? Probably not! I hardly thought of this mess the week I was in Arizona! And the thing I am most thrilled about in having a new job is the one thing that kept me from looking for one: not seeing band boy every day! The less I have to stare at my failure at being a friend with the guy I had a crush on the better!"

"event","Saw a website that sells knockoff watches! The exact same watch I bought on Canal Street in NYC for $10 sells on this site for $243!! How much are the real things??? Sheesh! 

This got me to thinking. Sure, the morality of buying a knockoff watch isn't in question. It's wrong and according to MSNBC, the bogus designer industry is bad for the economy! But what is a bigger crime, buying the knockoff or paying thousands for the real thing instead of feeding the poor, housing the poverty stricken, not tithing at church......ok, scratch that one! 

I love my fauxlex...my fake Rolex! It's lasted over month keeping perfect time! My Timex bought for full price at Target can't even say that!"

"event","Arrrrgh! It's PMS week! And today I had to listen to Jeff and Elida share inside jokes and cookies made by the squeeze! After that joy, I got to hear Jeff tell the squeeze over the phone how funny she is and announce the same to Elida after the call was done! He used to tell me how funny I was......not anymore! Why does that get to me every time? I think it's because he used to say we were such good friends because he shared ""goals and dreams"" with me! Not anymore! Was that just bullshit like our ""friendship"" was from the beginning???? Funny how the joke emails to me, the burned CDs, the stories of Jeff's life details stopped right about the time I stopped going to his gigs, which was right around the time his relationship with the squeeze came to light! Which came first???

Elida is friends with the squeeze and it wouldn't surprize me if she was the one that got them together! The squeeze is the one that used to walk around our floor like she was tough shit! Maybe she's told Jeff she doesn't want to be friends with me! Who cares! I am leaving for the greener pastures of a new job in a few weeks and it won't be a moment too soon!"

"event","There we are, three sleep deprived Bon Jovi fans, tooling down the Jersey Turnpike looking for our hotel with Shelley at the wheel and a english challenged hotel owner on the cel. You can't make a u-turn in the state to save our lives, no one lets you merge and hotel dude is telling me to follow the signs to the 109! It is twenty minutes later, when I feel like I am in a bad Twilight Zone episode that we finally see signs to the ONE AND NINE! It is then that I realize these Jersey trips are like childbirth: frustrating to go through but when you are done all you remember is the joy! 

""You travel all the way here to see them"" is a much asked question when natives inevitably find out we are from California and Georgia. The resounding answer is yes, given with huge smiles on our faces! Lucky for us we aren't there solely to navigate the highways and byways of the Garden State. We make the trip to mecca to see the Jovi boys on their home turf! In their backyard! For the Bon Jovi faithful, there is no better place to be when the guys play at home! 

For any band, the hometown shows are special and for Bon Jovi and their fans, those shows are at Giants Stadium! The Meadowlands! These shows have closed out the last three tours and have become must see in the land of Jovi! The band is on, there is electricity in the air and this year that was even more true with the lightning! It is cool to say that I was there for both ""rain"" shows that have taken place at Giant's the last two tours! In 2003, the band played on as we all ""took a shower"" together! This year, due to the lightning, the band came out for the 1st encore, sped through ""Livin On A Prayer"" and called it a night 20 minutes early! Despite the shortened show, it is a great feeling to know you are a part of something special, rain or no rain! 

The shows are great and a huge reason why we go. But they aren't the only reason! There is definite joy in seeing the place where your heroes grew up! You feel a connection seeing where Tommy and Gina grew up, went to high school,worked to pay the bills before the music thing took off! Seeing the homes they grew up in and the ones your concert money helped them buy today is great! You might call it stalking when you see my pictures of Jon's house from outside his gate. I call it seeing where my money went! If I hadn't spent all that money, maybe I could actually afford a double scoop at Crazee's! But knowing that I, in some small part, helped pay for the boat that is attached to the dock that is outside the massive chateau that Jon lives in somehow makes it ok! :)

The last couple of tours we have thrown in side trips into NYC! The first time, I was a little nervous! This native Southern Californian has heard all the stories of how crowded and dirty NYC is and how rude the people are! After my first trip, I couldn't imagine where the stories came from. Ok...i'll give ya crowded...maybe dirty! But the people are some of the nicest and friendliest people you will meet anywhere! Including L.A! I venture to say the people here are ruder by far! I LOVE NY!!! The energy, the people, the cops! They don't call those strapping hunks ""New York's Finest"" for nothing! And where else can you chase people with shopping carts down an alley to buy Pink Prada bags for $20! Shelley chasing that guy with Cindy close behind is a sight i'll never forget! I think we ended up with 5 or 6 Pradas between us with Cindy coming in the winner with 3! Sure, they aren't real but neither was the $10 Rolex I bought 1/2 a block down the street! I stood there and laughed at the irony that the only thing real on me that day was my tan and my boobs! How un-L.A. of me! 

Another huge reason to go on these trips is to be with friends! We don't see each other very often and being stuck in a car lost in NJ is a great way to reconnect! LOL! Seriously, who better to understand  
why the hamburgers taste better at the White Castle in Sayreville NJ than other Jovi fans! It isn't all Bon Jovi! We talked about crazy men and the women that love them...us! We laughted at other tourists and just all around had a great time! 

As Cindy and I hung out in Newark Airport for 6 hours after we dropped Shelley off, we decided to hang up our NJ shoes! SURE! It's only been a month and I have already forgotten the frustration of the turnpike and started counting down the years (then days) until I am back there again! This time I will know to look for the 1 and 9!"

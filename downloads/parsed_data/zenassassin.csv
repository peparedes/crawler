"event","Angela is leaving for Montana out of the blue, in three weeks. So great. 

 She said a bunch of stuff including how if we had gone to high school together or something in a non professional relationship she feels like we would have been friends & how we connected more than anyone else & how I was special & there were a few people she was going to miss & I was one of the main ones. She was anxious all day about telling me & didn't like me coming at 7, so late, cause she had to be anxious & worry all day about how she was going to tell me. She already found someone to turn me over to so she wouldn't have to put me on the list with everybody else to find a new one...she has one handpicked for me & already had talked to them about me."

"event","DEPRESSION: ""I doubt completely my ability to do anything well. It seems as though my mind has slowed down and burned out to the point of being virtually useless....[I am] haunt[ed]...with the total, the desperate hopelessness of it all... Others say, ""It's only temporary, it will pass, you will get over it,"" but, of course, they haven't any idea how I feel, although they are certain they do. If I can't feel, move, think, or care, then what on earth is the point?"" 

HYPOMANIA: ""At first when I'm high, it's tremendous...ideas are fast...like shooting stars you follow until brighter ones appear...all shyness disappears, the right words and gestures are suddenly there...uninteresting people, things, become intensely interesting. Sensuality is pervasive, the desire to seduce and be seduced is irresistible. Your marrow is infused with unbelievable feelings of ease, power, well-being, omnipotence, euphoria...you can do anything...but somewhere this changes."" 

MANIA: ""The fast ideas become too fast and there are far too many...overwhelming confusion replaces clarity...you stop keeping up with it-memory goes. Infectious humor ceases to amuse. Your friends become frightened...everything now is against the grain...you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable, and trapped."""

"event","As somebody who has drooled over Kiera Knightly since she first became well known, & knowing she is as well-liked as she is, it's hilarious & sick & sad to read THIS. SHow this to every chick you know who whines about how ""imperfect"" she is. NO WOMAN ever believes otherwise. NONE. Not even the supposed ""top of the world"" ones.
******************************************************************************** 

It's nice to know Hollywood doesn't discriminate when it comes to damaging a starlet's fragile self-esteem. Turns out the rickety and robust alike are made to feel lousy for failing to achieve an impossibly high standard of beauty. 

First up is Keira Knightley, 21, who reveals to Hello magazine that her prepossessing visage has been both a gift and a curse. 

""I do think I must have a nice face because I'm completely aware my face gets me work,"" acknowledges the actress, who last month sued a British newspaper for implying her Ginsu-sharp clavicles and fat-free abs might be the result of an eating disorder. ""But the problem is that if you happen to be someone who people think of as pretty, you also get so many people whose business it is to comment on your looks."" 

Sometimes unkindly. 

""I've been to photo shoots,"" she recalls, ""where the photographer has told me he'd kept my legs out of shot so I don't need to worry about them -- that of course makes you worry."" 

Not even her comely countenance escapes judgment. 

""Then I've had makeup artists who've told me they need to shade the top of my nose so it won't look so broken,"" says Knightley. ""I also got rejected for a job once because someone said I had a funny mouth."" 

As a result, she sighs, these supposed flaws become the ""things you start to focus on. You start off thinking you're OK, then you have to go to some event and you remember you have a weird mouth, a broken nose and horrible legs."""

"event","White Wolf is proud to announce the ""5th Game"" for World of Darkness will be Changeling! As envisioned by developer Ethan Skemp, fans can look forward to a complex setting where you character faces new challenges and dangers not seen before in the World of Darkness.

When asked to describe this latest addition to the White Wolf's product line, Ethan said, ""Changeling is a

game of beauty and cruelty, of passion and loss, of dreams and madness. You have struggled your way back through the thorns only to find your life had been stolen from you. Now you make your way the best you can, attempting to piece together the fragments of your lost life or to forge a new one, chasing your ambition through the intrigues of the changeling courts and freeholds, and always looking over your shoulder lest the Others, the true Fae, return for you.""

As additional details are released in the next twelve months, information will be posted for fans and retailers to share at: www.white-wolf.com/changeling."

"event","Well the summer is almost gone now & I have done absolutely nothing outdoors to take advantage of it. I was all full of painting outside inspiration but for some reason it's just roadblocked. Why, I don't know & it's a *problem*. Someone throw me a bone here.

 Part of it is every time I go over to the park in the daytime, in the summer, there are, shockingly, kids & families & happy puppy/sports/playground fun shit all over the place. The issue here is that they stare at me like they saw a serial killer. Again, I don't look that weird or offensive. At any rate, it makes me so damn self conscious I have a hard time even rushing by let alone stop & set up a shit-ton of painting crap laboriously hauled over there on foot, only to work for like 20 minutes then feel like I am under a spotlight then bolt.

 And I have no chance to get anywhere besides the park, being as I can't drive. 

 There will also be zero camping, no houseboat or any kind of even one-day vacation, & probably no Bloomington which really blows. I go down for Changeling & get all psyched to play, then totally choke once I am down there like 75% of the time. But even if I just walk around & check out the little museum & just enjoy the place & the little chapel & graveyard & all thsoe giant black oaks, it's still fantastic. Maybe I'll hitchhike. I don't even know if they still DO the game actually, it's been almost 2 years."

"event","1. What is the best way to get over someone?

  A neverending downward spiral of self-loathing, blame & kamikaze semi-suicidal explosiveness that eventually ends up just becoming routine. 

2. What makeup do you wear on a daily basis?

 None unless its maybe nail polish. I should wear eyeliner more though, since it makes me look better than all you bitches! Ya that's right, I went there. I don't have the guts though.

3. Have you ever been to a different country?
 The Bahamas & all over the Carribean, plus England. 

4. If you could eat one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be?

Dungenness crab or else ice cream. Not together.

5. What curse word do you use the most?

Does douchebag count? That or fuck.

6. Do you own an ipod?

 Yes but it doesn't work & just make a nice heavy paperweight. 

7. What time is your alarm clock set for?

 Whatever time it was when I unplugged it & threw it in a box in the closet. 

8. Have you ever bid for something on ebay?

 Oh hell yes. Maybe I say hell more than fuck. But yes, lots of books, stupid action figures, stupid LotR swords, CD's. Shit I can't find just by shopping.

9. Do you wear flip-flops even when its cold outside?

 Town & Country 4 lyfe.

11. Would you rather take the picture or be in the picture?

It's become a cliche now but I was knocking cameras out of people's hands sicne I was 5. Don't think I'm exaggerating. I know someone who has a picture of me she took at a party (no I am not doing anything incriminating just waving or whatever)...& I have made fairly elaborate, devious plans to get into her photos box to destroy it. 

 I have been drawing people since I was a little kid & have never done a single self-portrait or let anyone else do one. Ever. Even a girl I was totally in lust with who was using drawing me to get into my pants. 

12. What was the last movie you watched?

 Grease, unfortunately.

An even bigger aquarium. Like 900 gallons. Seriously.

16. Have you ever taken medication to help you fall asleep?

Does Hornsby Cider count as ""medication""? And yeah, not sleeping pills per se but knockout painkillers after surgery & shit like that. Also Nyquil nighttime when I had the flu (or just wanted to die a lot).

17. What CD is currently in your CD player?

 A random mix CD of Siouxsie Sioux. 

18. Do you prefer regular or chocolate milk?

 I like chocolate better & distrust anyone who says otherwise.

19. Has anyone told you a secret this week?

 Yes. 

20. When was the last time someone hit on you?

 I usually miss it cause I am famously oblivious to these things. Ask Ed Lipinski. Last time I can REMEBER, was on the phone a few weeks ago. Best not discussed. 

21. What is your biggest fear?

Social situations. Dying in a car wreck (more panic/reflex than fear). Other than that I am pretty much fearless...tough guys, grizzly bears, bugs & snakes, sharks, alligators, crackheads with guns, none of the usual shit phases me whatsoever.

 N/A. Fuck cars (see above).

 Yes. Bad idea.

31. Did you watch cartoons as a child?

 Every child did ffs. Even Mormons. 

32. How big is your local mall?

 The most local mall is I guess medium sized? What the fuck, is there some metric scale I don't know about here? I have seen smaller & much bigger. 

33. What do you miss most?

 My friends not having given up all hope of having non-lameass boring downtrodden whipped-dog lives & hope for the future. 

34. Would you ever sky dive?

 If it was free. And not into combat.

35. What are you allergic to?

 Not a damn thing unless you count poison ivy. 

36. What is your biggest regret?

Wow that's just too personal.

 That sounds like a SPORT to me. We don't take kindly to that kind of talk around here.

38. Where would you most like to visit if you could?

 Montmarte, Paris. 

39. how often do you check myspace?

 Whenever I am required to due to the actions of others. Popup-riddled hellhole. 

40. Do you have any physical limitations?

 Well in reality, being kind of fucking insane IS a physical limitation as it results from physical problems & chemistry in the brain. Plus I have all 4 wisdom teeth impacted, since I was like 24 & won't have any way to get them fixed, well...ever.

41. Have you ever had Jamba Juice?

 Who with the what now?

42. When was the last time you laughed so hard your sides hurt?

 Oh boy, ok, I play World Of Warcraft (too) much. You can play these huge bad ass lookig hulking monotaur types. I found this hat that was meant for humans, but I could wear. A cowboy hat. On giant steer horns. It was the greatest goddamn thing ever. 

 I guess you had to be there. 

43. What movies do you know every line to?

 Anything we had on VHS when I was a kid. All the Star Wars & Indiana Jones movies. Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The Princess Bride. Pretty much any Disney classic especially the musicals (no wonder people think I'm gay). Sin City. All the Lord of the Rings movies (scary no?). 

44. Do you own any band t-shirts?

 Yes, like maybe 4. Is Bjork a band?

45. What is your favorite candle scent?

 Pumpkin spice/fall shit or else ""vanilla sugar"". 

46. How many aunts and uncles do you have?

13.

47. When was your last plane ride?

 February 2005. 

48. Do you crack your knuckles?

 Shit yes. 

49. How many chairs are at your dining room table?

 I don't have a dining room & the dining room table I own is a painting/gaming table & thus, the number varies.

50. What is your favorite salad dressing?

 Whichever one make salad disappear. 

51. Do you read for fun?

 Fun AND education! 

52. Do you speak any other languages?

 Not really. Which sucks. I learned a lot of Gaelic but not enough to converse & now I have forgotten it all. I can still decode what a sign means though. Ditto Latin. 

53. Where is your cell phone?

 Fuck cell phones. It's like tying a screaming soiled-diaper chimpanzee with herpes & rabies around your neck. Then someone slaps it. 

54. Do you do your own dishes?

 I do multiple people's. 

55. What color is your bedroom painted?

 Generic apartment-mandated white.

56. Are your parents home?

 I imagine they are. 

57. Have you ever cried in public?

 Yeah. Have I mentioned I just don't give a fuck?

59. Which do you make Love or War?

 Is there a difference??? (oh come on it was just handed to me)

60. Are you always trying to learn new things?

 Yes, unfortunately, most of it useless.

61. TV Shows you must watch

 I don't have TV. When I did, I watched Degrassi The Next Generation & Venture Brothers.

63. Are you currently wanting any piercings or tattoos?

 Tattoos pretty much uniformly looks like crap, or they do after too long, also, I can't keep the same desktop wallpaper for over 2 days. I would spend a year designing it & then the rest of my life wishing I had done it better & finding all the flaws in it. 

 People tell me a lot that I should get piercings but I can't remember which ear makes me gay. 

64. Do you believe that the guy should pay on the first date?

 It's classy to pay or at least offer to.  But ""the man should always pay cause he's the man & I am a commodity as a female"" is like 1 step away from prostitution. Which IS IN FACT the origination of the whole idea. 

65. Can you skip rocks?
 
 I could kill your ass with a piece of shale. Even if you aren't in the water. 

66. Favorite flower?

 Lilacs or honeysuckle. 

67. Have you ever been to Jamaica?

 Yes.

68. What do you snack on in the movies?

 Popcorn & Milk Duds or whatever food I snuck in.

69. Who was/is your favorite teacher?

 Jason Cope. 

70. Ever watch porn?

 Used to be too timid but now, hells yes.

71. What is the weather like?

 A little too sweltering & muggy even for me. And I like it to be like a tropical reptile likes it. 

72. Would you ever date someone covered in tattoos?

 I doubt it. If she was really great & they didn't look like TOTAL ass, maybe. Then again I might also date a girl with a missing arm & it's pretty much the same question. 

73. Do you have an online journal? 

 No. You're imagining this whole thing.

74. Did you ever play Capture the Flag in school?

 Not in school but in airsoft (its like paintball only cool) & of course in gaming. 

75. What was your favorite class in high school?

 Drama. Obviously it has served me well in the real world unlike, say, math. 

76. Do you sleep on your side, tummy, or back?

I toss between left & right side. 

77. What personality trait is a must have in the preferred sex?

 That's a reeeeaaal complex question. 

78. Have you ever been attracted to someone physically unattractive?

 Hmm. By my own standards? No because I pretty much find soemthing beautiful about anyone (aaaaaawwww!!).

79. When was the last time you slept on the floor?

 Like a year ago.

80. What is your favorite alcoholic drink?

 Vodka...amaretto stone sour. Or else a yard of cider.

81. If you were born the opposite sex, what would your name have been?

 In reality it would have been Rebecca. MY preference would be Lilah or maybe just Jessica.

82. Do you like your living arrangement?

 I hate my actual apartment, love my apartment surroundings & who I live with most of the time.

83. Has anyone ever called you spoiled?

 Yes. Oddly. 

84. What is your mother and father's hometowns?
Mom, someplace in Kentucky... Dad, Tennessee

85. Did you ever go to the same school as your parents?

 My high school was the middle school my dad went to.

86. Are you anal about anything?

 It's hard to tell. My apartment is destroyed by someone who is the opposote of anal so the line is really blurred.

87. How much is gas where you live right now?

 Enough that it's getting Republicans voted out of office, which rocks.

88. What was the last thing to scare you?

 My semi-annual mandatory huge family visit.

89. Do you own a Playstation?

 Yes, PS1. 

90. How many times have you brushed your teeth today?

 Zero, it's 8am & I have been up since 6PM yesterday. Wait no I did it in the shower...yes. It's all a big haze.

92. What album did you buy last?

Enigma ""MCMXCa.d."". For the third time.

 Carpet.

97. Were you a "" planned "" child?

 No, people didn't ""plan"" kids back then. Don't let them fucking lie to you. 

98. What is your mom's name?

 Susan Elizabeth.

99. What is your dad's name?

 Earl AHEM II

100. How old will you be turning next year?

 I won't be turning anything if my plan works (lichdom). If not, I will be dead at the hands of some wily adventurers with torches & swords."

 ANYWAY!

 Long story....no computerwebnet machine for like a month & I am waaay behind on LJ & email. So much I need to write that it seems like a mountain I can't even start to climb. I have many emails & posts people have sent me that I never answered & all I can say is, none of it has gone unread & I have fully appreciated it all. PRINCESS706 I will email you soon to try to nail down plans for art hijinks & stuff! mary I am gonna talk to you about sending me pictures for this purpose. 

 I have gotten a little work done the last few weeks after a HUGE crazy manic flurry of art that lasted like a solid month nonstop...I have not peaked creatively like this in many years & haven't sustained it for anywhere near so long in at least 10 years. usually at best I get psyched for short bursts then crash out of it real fast again. having to do what little I do finish in fits & starts which is real bad when you're trying to do oils & especially in the style I want to focus on. I made a major breakthrough & I need to follow it up & solidify it before I lose it again. 

<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/71/193284798_21d282c307.jpg?v=0"">

I am very calm, logical, non-hyperbolic & rational when I say I really need to either make this my life again & go forward with it or just fucking drink that Drain-O & Vodka Martini.

 I think the not having a computer was a big help, it's a huge distraction & I am afraid it's turned into the t.v. I so loathe people being absorbed into. I need to find a way to stay away from the internet waaaay more than I do & to focus on being productive/socializing when I am on it instead of gaming nonstop or just surfing around. 

 I will be posting up new stuff on here, getting plans made for more portraits with people I have not yet done, & am possibly going to a private art academy in the fall, it's unreal. More on that later. 

 On a side note, anyone else heard ""Ornaments of Gold"" by Siouxsie Sioux? For some reason I had never heard it till recently & I don't know why but it is just CRUSHINGLY beautiful & just fucking destroys me, like to tears, & it's not really even meant to be a sad song. 

 Boy I am longwinded. So someone is coming out here I used to be close to & lives off way away now but when she is here I'm gonna do some in depth pieces of her. 

 I am also now on shiny medication, I finally caved. This will be the first time I have ever been on any save one time in like 1994 & only for maybe a month. This is much more potent shit & I will finish ""phasing into"" my eventual full dosage in a month or so. It's one of those things where it has to build up a high level in your system & this takes time plus they have to ease you into it (to make it easier to acclimate & to monitor any problems).  After THIS has been done, I am gonna be on another kind at the same time, even more hardcore stuff. BOY howdy I must be craaaaazy! So far there's been no effect I can see but then, there isn't really supposed to be yet."

I am super burned out on it all & need some new stuff to keep motivated. I can't draw in silence! 

 In the interests of A) amusement & B) everybody maybe finding new shit to listen to, I would like everyone to put up a list of their top 5 or 10 must have albums/musicians/songs. You don't need to do all three categories, & don't agonize over makign a real ""top favorites of all time"", make a list of things you like & are listening to right NOW or all time obvious things that jump to mind quickly then just throw 'em up there!"

"event","""Joan of Arc's short haircut had a profound effect on women's hairstyles in the twentieth century. In 1909, the Paris hairdresser Antoine took Joan of Arc as the inspiration for the bob, which ended centuries of taboo against women who cut their hair. The style became popular in the 1920s and was associated with liberated women. Nearly all subsequent Western hair fashions are designed for women who cut their hair at least occasionally."""

"event","A master calligrapher was writing some characters onto a piece of paper. One of his especially perceptive students was watching him. When the calligrapher was finished, he asked for the student's opinion - who immediately told him that it wasn't any good. The master tried again, but the student criticized the work again. Over and over, the calligrapher carefully redrew the same characters, and each time the student rejected it. Finally, when the student had turned his attention away to something else and wasn't watching, the master seized the opportunity to quickly dash off the characters. ""There! How's that?,"" he asked the student. The student turned to look. ""THAT.... is a masterpiece!"" he exclaimed."

 (Note: Since they are *fictional* for this, I am just gonna skip right by the whole ""is it valid to lust for cartoons/drawings"" question & just play the 'artist' card. Of course it's ok!) 

1. Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough (Sophie Marceau & yes I would be Bond). 

2. Winnowill from Elfquest. On her black velvet & white featherdown robe. Anyone who knows who she is, probably knows the appeal & the twist to this character as far as this subject goes.

3. Mareka the Spiderguild woman from the Glasswright series by Mindy Klasky. When we are both drugged with her spider venom brew. Is there a theme developing?

4. Arwen of course!! She's like a young chick physically, limber, but with like 5000 years to fine tune her technique.

5. Audrey Tautou's character in He Loves me, He Loves Me Not. 

6. Cordellia Chase (on Angel, *not* on Buffy) 

7. Devi from I Feel Sick (& Johnny the Homicidal Maniac but way less so)

8. Audrey in Twin Peaks (Sherilyn Fenn) She ties a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue. Which I also can do, in case anyone needs that service.

9. Samus Aran from Metroid Prime.

10. Sydnee on Melrose Place. Yes, the really trashy redhead stripper.

 I guess mine is not so much a TOP 10, as it's the first 10 I thought of. I had a hard time seperating characters from actresses who played them (hence no Jessica Alba on here, I like *her* but not especially anyone she *played*). Character in books, I often admire or even feel romantic about but seldom in a ""sex with"" kind of way. Maybe I'm not the degenerate I thought!

 I think I tend to go for femme fatales w/ dark hair & cruel plans, or else sort of innocent yet flawed warrior woman types. ...which my real life dating habits tends to back up, come to think of it! 

 Tag: Viperkrystal, Sogi, Troubldgal, Princess, & Ed Lipinski (who I know has this all figured out already cause he is a pig)."

"event","...went to what I like to call the Crazy House For Boys last week; another visit coming this Wednesday. Not actually the crazy house, just a counselor/therapist. Why, you might ask, would I decide to do that after many many years (all of 'em actually!) of being what people politely term ""crazy""? 

 I don't really know. I guess it was a combination of various factors such as deaths of friends & role models (2), dear sweet best friends gone to shit & filth & lost beyond even my power to reach (1), friends gone to who knows what & pretty much lost (2-3), job prospects (0), days totally unable to face leaving my bedroom (several), money (0), finished art projects in the last year (like 3), dead pets (3 not counting rodents)....hmmm. I also feel winter cming on already. Ridiculous bu true. And I can tell already that this one is gonna be a show stopper, even worse than the last.

 This is on the verge of near-total, self-absorbed-sounding, boring, whininess, but hey! It's a journal! It's their reason to be right? 

 I think it was a rare combination of the frequent despondency & feeling trapped & helpless, combined with an unusual feeling of desperation with a hint of an odd resolution to do SOMEthing. 

 Luckily, I am pretty sure it won't do a lick of good, I already scared one therapist (interesting that her years of jaded professionalism were shattered by me in a mere hour). The other one (who will theoretically be my long-term one) was kind of obviously unsure as to how to deal with me or what to do io say & sort of had that ""human instinct says to avoid the diseased"" thing going on. I felt like I was on trial under a spotlight while at the same time, being ignored or blown off. TALENT on her part, no?

 Should I ever bother going back? And assuming I do, what do I even say? Are you supposed to spill everything, all your guts, REALLY, or more like put forth a presentation & converse normally?"

"event","Well I just spent THREE freakin' hours toiling through tutorials on making animated GIFs in Photoshop. God what a pain in the ass, no wonder no one does it & everyone just steal's everybody's else's icons & avatars. 

 It's a very powerful tool but it's like they TRIED to block creativity with interface/illogic related roadblocks.

 Point? It's just a great concrete example of two pet peeves of mine:

 * Left-side brain thinking in places where it has no business, i.e. art/photography programs. Clearly, a program NOT made by artists or with actually MAKING art in mind at ALL. 

 * Interfaces of software that are obtuse as hell & clearly never underwent testing to make sure that people could use it that WERE NOT the people who designed it. Really, this shit should not require courses to use a damn program FFS. It's NOT that complex really, just badly thought out. I'm sure some chump will soon jump to its defense but guess what: if Degas had to learn this fiddly programmer computer-logic garbage to paint a picture...he would never have bothered. 

 Tools should help you do what you're doing, not get in the damn way."

"event","...if whoever created Live Journal realized its main use would be for bitching about your life (pretty obvious) and for POINTLESS BUT AMUSING QUIZZES NO ONE READS!

1. What's on your bedside table? 
 A beautiful Art Deco lamp w/ Tiffany glass that I am sad no one sees (as it's in the bedroom). A hand me down from a wealthy relative. An alarm clock (ok so CAROLE uses it!). Various half read books, hair ties, some mint Kama Sutra oil, various empty glasses, & the little ""branch"" that grapes come on, minus the grapes.

2. What's the geekiest part of your music collection?
 Depends on who you ask & what the year is. Probably either Deborah Gibson (yes Debbie but circa 1999, far geekier no?) or else some anime soundtrack like Bubblegum Crisis 2040. And a lot of MP3s I burned that DAMN are they geeky. Like stuff from the Buffy musical which I love, or Lovecraftian/Cthulhu based punkrock.

3. What do you eat when you raid the fridge at night?
 Various frozen fish fillets (mmm salmon), any kind of chocolate or ice cream I can find. 

4. What is your secret guaranteed weeping film?
 Romeo & Juliet. The Claire Danes one w/ the guns & shit OR the old one with Olivia Hussey. Also, Gone With The Wind & Braveheart. And often, Disney's Beauty & the Beast. 

 ...What's that? ""You lame ass pussbag! Disney?!"" you say? Well try this. Get mopey to begin with for good measure. Reflect on dead or gone ex's & friends. Then watch the Beast, dying after finally learning to love in cartoon glory, say, ""At least...I got to see you...one last time...."" *dies* 

   Then a gentle rain begins to fall, mixing with the tears on Belle's cheeks. 

 !SI bet even Sergeant Hartman even cried!!!!!!!!

5. If you could have plastic surgery, what would you have done?
 I would have Micheal Jackson's face made into a black man's again. OH you meant on myself? I dunno but it would start with a new head. Alas surgery cannot aid my self esteem issues. Hm.

6. Do you have a completely irrational fear?
 No. I am fearless to a fault & the few fears I do have are all completely rational & justified logically. I fear getting hit in cars because it happens & will happen & I ride with horrible drivers & have been hit & nearly killed several times. Rational. I do fear certain social situations immensely but that's also pretty rational: I know people actually DO dislike me, misunderstand me, & are very likely to humiliate or harm me. Rational. 

7. What is the little physical habit that gives away your insecure moments?
 My entire physical demeanor gives away my overwhelming insecurity to the point that it chases people off like a leper's bandages. Hair hiding my face, always having a barricade like a book or sketch pad are two often commented on.  

8. Do you ever have to beg? 
 For what? For myself, no. To others to not, say, fuck up their life irredeemably or hurt themselves, yes, I will. 

9. Do you have too many love interests?
 Does this mean that I am interested in, or that are interested in me? Not exactly, & absolutely, respectively.

10. Do you know anyone famous?
 Depends on what ""famous"" means. I know people who did things like design Origins award winning games, & my own work is seen on boxes in every mall in the U.S. & Europe. But only geeks know these things & my name is not know whatsoever, so I guess that's famous within a niche of a few million people at best. Is that a yes? Probably a ""no"". 

11. Describe your bed.
 Queen, no headboard or frame, high enough off the ground to be ahem, convenient, nice linen sheets, up to 8 blankets at any given time, always a hand made afghan from my granny that she made when I was 2. The only pillow I can use w/o a neck ache is a little velvet handmade one by someone very very dear to me but who has since fallen so far that it hurts me to even sleep on it. 

12. Spontaneous or plan? 
 I plan to be spontaneous. This does in fact make sense. 

13. Who should play you in a movie about your life? 
 Me. Elijah Wood. Or maybe Johnny Depp 10 years ago.

14. Do you know how to play poker?
 Barely. But I am usually too drunk to really play & consider money lost to actually be money SPENT on liquor. If I wanna play a casual party type game & actually pay attention & care, it's not gonna be lame ass breeder card games. It would be cool ass geek games like Give Me The Brain or Falling or Magic or LotR Trivial Pursuit.

15. What do you carry with you at all times?
 A book or sketchbook (see above). A sense of impending doom or else pointlessly unrealistic optimism. Because I am OH SO GOTH!!

16. How do you drive?
 At gunpoint. Actually, when I do, very well, I am told. With precision but patient & not much pass pass pass shit people constantly feel the need to do like they are in a race but in fact, they get there milliseconds sooner at best. Pick a lane, ass hats!

17. What do you miss most about being little?
 I never was. Or at least, not any more than I am now. I didn't change much. 

18. Are you happy with your given name?
 Oh you poor naive child! I would rather have a code number than this name. It's like a bad name for a Vampire RPG character. 

20. What was the last song you were listening to?
 Goldfinger sung by Shirley Bassey. 

21. Have you ever been in a school play? 
 Very very brief walk on part w/o lines. But I did a lot of behind the scenes stuff like painting backdrops & loved it. Wish I could get into that stuff again or have a part (as long as there was no singing or dancing & no one was allowed in the theater while I was onstage, is that a problem?).

22. Have you ever been in love? 
 Unfortunately, a lot & often.

Worst Things to Say to Someone Who Is Depressed
Version 1.7 April 29, 1995

Some people trivialize depression (often unintentionally) by dropping a platitude on a depressed person as if that is the one thing they needed to hear. While some of these thoughts have been helpful to some people (for example, some find that praying is very helpful), the context in which they are often said mitigates any intended benefit to the hearer. Platitudes don't cure depression.


0. ""What's *your* problem?""

1. ""Will you stop that constant whining? What makes you think that anyone cares?""

2. ""Have you gotten tired yet of all this me-me-me stuff?""

4. ""But it's all in your mind.""

5. ""I thought you were stronger than that.""

6. ""No one ever said life was fair.""

8. ""Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.""

10. ""Why don't you just grow up?""

11. ""Stop feeling sorry for yourself.""

12. ""There are a lot of people worse off than you?""

13. ""You have it so good, why aren't you happy?""

14. ""It's a beautiful day!""

15. ""You have so many things to be thankful for, why are you depressed!""

16. ""What do you have to be depressed about"".

17. ""Happiness is a choice""

18. ""You think *you've* got problems...""

     lightening-scarred church
  unwholesome weeds, cracking tiles

 ringing screaming chant
     wailing primal unknown speech

 pig-like eyes, cracked teeth
scraggly beard and goatish face
 those OTHER Whatleys


        tossing storm wracked sea

      thank God for the fog

              
 endless baying, how

 angles are their guide


 sliding on slick stone
      door to death or gate to life?

"event","So I just left a bitch comment in Megs journal.
Whoops. Didn't actually mean to, I was aiming to be nice.
Well Sean told me I should try and talk to her, then maybe I wouldn't hate her so much.
Hmm, not working so far. Tisk tisk. Shame on Nikki.
Whatever, she'll probably just e-mail him and complain, and then we'll have an argument, during which I will start to cry...and then everything will be fine.
Or maybe she won't find it bitchy (considering it wasn't meant to be), and it'll all be fine. Whatever, I could give a fuck-less either way.
So yea people, I never fucking write in this LJ anyway, if you want to know what's going on with me really, check my DJ http://www.deadjournal.com/users/MoniconeNik
Otherwise... I dunno, that's all. Bye for now.

"event","So here's for an update.
We're watching some not funny Jewish standup comedian. Her mom jokes are funny... but everything else she says was kinda <i>eh</i>.
So anyways... Man talk about Drama. Wes & Aubrey split. Personally I am glad. I think Aubrey will do much better on her own. Wes was a very dear friend to me.. but once he decided to choose sides and go with Lisa.. Well I never forgive that kind of betrayal. Plus he was never the same again anyway. He wasn't the fun Wes I knew before. He wasn't cool. He sucked. I guess all my influence was rubbed away by his new friends... Oh well you win some, ya lose some. And I know I will always have Aubrey. :) But like... I think this whole situation is so stupid. I'm getting blamed for shit.. Aubrey left Wes because they didn't have a marriage. They haven't lived together as a married couple in almost a year I think? And they worked seperately.. they only saw eachother on days off. It wasn't a marriage and Aubrey was miserable. GOOD FOR HER THAT SHE LEFT! She deserves to be happy and to live her life. Just because she has a son does not mean she doesn't deserve fun in her life. And she certainly didn't have that with Wes. So I'm happy for her. But now people (and I won't name names) are fingering me as the culprit. How the FUCK they got that is just beyond me... Actually no, it's not. See I fell out of Love with Bobby, who was being a total ass, and dragging us both down. I was unhappy and mean to him, he was unhappy and mean to me. We were both asses and I needed to do what was right for me. It just so happened that I was confused and scared and I turned to someone who I ended up falling deeper in Love than I have ever been before. I mean I am sad that Bobby and I had to hurt so much.. But I'm SO happy. So I do not regret my decision to leave Bobby at all. We're both very happy with the lives we have gotten since our time together ended. I mean I know we miss eachother but so what. The good outweighs the bad. Anyways, back to my original point. Since I was the first one out of our group to do something like that, automatically everyone goes ""Oh this must be Nikkis influence, she left Bobby so she must have talked Aubrey into leaving Wes"". Yea? Well FUCK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WHO THINK THAT. I have ALWAYS been a GOOD friend to everyone in that group. They all loved me until I started seeing Sean. So screw you all. If Aubrey wants to try life on her own without a husband, more power to her. They got married too young .<i>I</i> would know better than anyone else in Clairemont that we kick it with. I had a baby at an early age and I almost got married too. Thank god I didn't. So Aubrey and I are the only ones who really would understand. Oh and maybe the other slut. Who's name I won't mention because we share mutual friends and it would cause to much turmoil. But let's just say she kissed Bobby once and her initials are 'B' and that doesn't stand for Bitch. Although she is one, and a skank too. :)

But Aubrey and I have been best friends for so many years now. I mean I know she has other friends and so do I, but it's like we have this closeness that she can only fake with other people. It makes me feel special knowing that I know secrets no one else but Sew does :)

So Sarah and Brian and Paula came over today... Jeez man. I like Sarah but she's 15 and she <i>acts</i>10!!! Arrrrggghhh!! Anyways I think Paula is due in like exactly a month...

I haven't talked to Lisa in a while. I hope her and Bobby are doing well. I think she started back at High School... so that's got to seriously suck for her.

Marisa called me for a short while the other day... I can't wait for her to come see me!!!!!!!!!! I miss her <i>SO</i> much!!!!! I miss her! I do!! My girl!! My baby 'risa. 
I wish she were here.. I miss talking to her and doing all our cousin things. Man family kicks ass. They can suck at times, but in the long run, if you're lucky, you have good family. I know I do. 


Lili has been talking sooooooooooo much. Her vocabulary has bulked up SO much. I'm shocked. She just straight up talks now. It's weird but the coolest thing.. She's gotten so damn tall. And good lord, ALL THAT HAIR!! She runs too. Isn't that fun? RUNNING BABIES! Man can they get some speed. Lol. Look away for two seconds and they are <i>gone</i>.

Anyway I will try to update much more frequently. Love to all those who I Love and fuck off to those I don't.

But what we found out, is that each one of us is a Brain, and an Athlete, and a Basketcase, a Princess, and a Criminal. Does that answer your question?

I Love you chick. I'm drunk right now, but I love you none the less when I'm sober. I just tease because I am insecure and my teasing is perhaps some strange way of showing my vulnerabilities to those whom I love and trust. Wow, aren't I Dr. Nikki."

"event","So I haven't written in kind of a while. So here goes. My belly button piercing seems to be healing quite nicely. It looks a little red still, but that's normal. I'm so glad I got a barbell instead of a hoop. The hoop look is cute, if you're going for Hippy or whatever, but I think the barbell looks much sexier all around.
Seans and my tattoos healed nicely, they look real good. Seans looks better than mine, but that's because he can resist the urge to touch his, unlike me.

CAROLYN IS HERE IN 10 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Is excitedly wiggling around in her chair*
I can't wait. I haven't seen her since I was 16.
She is one of those friends who you never really grow apart from, no matter how far apart you are. We don't talk as often, and never see each other. Which sucks.... A LOT. 
But what can I do? I know I can't get married without her. She will always be part of my life in some way or another, I hope...
So yea. 
When she's here, we wanted to try and get matching tat's of a black rose. Why a black rose you ask? Well, her middle name is Rose, and my middle name means Night (night = black), so that's why.
At some point, I hope we get some time to just kick it by ourselves. Sean will maybe watch Lili and Care and I can go off or something..... I hope she stays with her grandma and not her aunt. I don't know her aunt all that well, I mean I went camping with her family that one time (he he, remember Care? David Vetrano? hee hee hee), and she was nice enough. But I like her grandma a lot, and all her aunts and cousins who used to show up there a lot. 
GOD! I JUST PRAY/HOPE I DO NOT SEE MARK!!!!!!!!!!!! *Screams and yanks her hair* NOoooooooooooooo!! Carolyn, NO MARK!!!!!
David... Maybe.. hehehe JUST KIDDING!! NOT NO WAY EVER!!! 
~I Love You Sean :D
Ok then. I also hope Andrew (if I see him) isn't a total dick to me (he's known for being one)... and I REALLY hope I get to see Aunt Joe!! (Spell?)
Yea sooo... there's my update.
Oh also, I should mention, apparently, Lisa found Seans DJ and posted a comment. We know it was her because 1.) The comment was very insulting towards me, and 2.) It was horribly misspelled. And as we all know, the more inbred you are, the less functional brain cells you have, which would result in the inability to spell anything. I.E., inbred = Lisa. 

 Bye all!! I'll write more later

"event","HELLOOOO to everyone who reads this. Well we're in San D still. It's cool. Not as hot here as it is up where we live. So we're going to Sea World today. Cool. I think Miss. Boo will LOVE it, what with all the animals there are (and boy does she LOOOVE Animals).
So yea, Sean and I got our tattos (more than we had originally planned on, actually). Sean got the Nephthys symbol and ""Know Thyself"" in Latin across his left pec muscle. I got the Kanji for ""Sean"" and my belly button pierced!! Yay! Hehe. We got the tat's in a very private place (one which I'm still willing to show everyone, as I have demonstrated over the past few days), and they look incredible! I'm so proud.
Ahh, good old San Diego weather. It looks as though it may rain. I Love it like this. It's my favorite weather of all. Grey and overcast and cloudy. *Happy Sigh* I wish it could be like this always. *Imagines a grey, overcast, cloudy world and grins*
So if the weather does continue in this direction, than Sea Worlds a No.
Marcy got the day off, but wants to go with anyway. So right on.
I miss my house family. *Gets happy feeling picturing her room*
I miss a lot of stuff. 
Sooo, I have yet to run into Bobo & The little underage slut. She is such a bop airhead. She swears hardcore like she's a raver though (ROTFLMFAO). Yea I'm so sure she's gone to a rave (and I don't mean the ""raves"" thrown by the christian youth groups down at Horizon). So yea, lucky for her, she has done a good job of avoiding me. I don't suppose she get's out of clairemont much anyway. You know those inbred poor folk don't like to leave their trailers much. Anyway, if I don't hear about her talking anymore shit, this should be pretty much the last you hear of me speaking of her. But, as we all know, she can't keep her thin lipped ugly mouth shut. Ewww. *Shudders thinking of Lisas mouth*
Ta ta now, I'm off to go do... stuff. Like belly button piercing maintenance (have to keep it super clean so as not to get infected). Write more later.

"event","Hi-Lo!!!!!!!!!
Here's my birthday update.
WOW!! I had the bestest birthday!
Seriously, it kicked soooo much ass.
Sean and I went to a Spa place, and there was this GROOVY ass hot tub and Sauna and Shower and this neat-o warm bed you could nap on. It ROCKED!! All courtesy of Shannon and my dad :) 
Thank you guys SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much!
It couldn't have been a better birthday!! Well, except maybe if there had been CAKE!! Tee hee hee, just kidding.
I LOVED my special day. And Sean made it so nice too. I woke up (on my own mind you, not by the hands of our daughter smacking me awake), after getting a wonderful nights rest (well ok, not a full night. Sean kept me up doing very generous and pleasing birthday things.. things which I won't mention *giggle*)  to a BEAUTIFUL bouquet of Dark Purple Baby Carnations, that Sean and Lili picked out for me, and our ""coke"" we had been having an on-going joke about, candy and the sweetest cards :) God, Sean is such an amazing Daddy. He does everything so well. Liliana is talking so much, and walking. Sean takes her on walks to the park everyday, and we have picnics and they play on the playground. We're all going to the Zoo while we're in San D. She will LOVE that. And Marcy is getting us into Sea World, considering she works there. Lili and I are so lucky to have Sean in our lives. We could not ask for better. :) 
I feel so loved!
*smiling*
This has been the best birthday I can remember. Thank you Sean, Shannon, Dad & Liliana.

So we leave tomorrow for San D. I'm kinda unhappy/nervous about flying on the 4th. I mean with all the terrorist threats and crap. Arrrggghh.
I just hope we'll be ok. 
Liliana has been TALKING soooooooo much. It's unbelievable!! 
Let's see....what else is new and great. 

Umm...well I'm actually pretty tired and have a backache, but there's still packing to do..

Well Friday is the day Bobby and I exchange our crap. Woo woo. What a treat that will be *rolls eyes*.
I know he's going to pull some crap (as he always does, duh). I just hope it's nothing major. I really don't feel like beating anyones ass. But ya know, ya gotta do what you gotta do. *wink* So yea, I have all his stupid shit, and he can sooooo totally have this pile of crap. I seriously hope they do pull some shit. Give me a fucking reason (as if I needed one) to beat the life out of Lisa Andrews. Wow, Andrews, what a cool last name that is. *Snorts*
Hehe, I bet that little inbred botched abortion couldnt pronounce my name if she TRIED! 
Slutty litte ....Slut?
ANYWAYS.

"event","Panther Pride Night was last night and we performed and did awesome...or so people say..I was just happy that I didn't fall! : )  So school started..: (  blah!! lol but it was good seeing everyone again.. but it's gay having to wake up at 6:30!!! lol I'm so tired by like 9:00 and like I never go to bed that early so it's way weird...lol ok so yesterday I wake up and start doing homework when my mom comes upstairs and says there are some football guys here to see you...and I'm like eew...I have not yet brushed my hair, washed my face, or even freaking brushed my teeth so I'm really really gross..I'd been up for like maybe 15 minutes...so I'm all like tell them to go away lol and she's like no no they really want to see you and so I go downstairs ugly and all..and guess who it was...Ricky...lol oh joy! (can you sense the sarcasm??) lol but yea I was like gross don't' come see me early in the morning! lol but he's a nice guy...and then yesterday I did chores and homework...ok so I had the weirdest dream last night...that Jonathon and I were back together again and we had a fight...because apparently he had told me his dad was dying and I didn't like care...and the weirdest thing was he was still living here but his parents were in Wisconsin and then the fact that his dad was dying was really weird because he started crying and then I started crying...I don't know it was a really strange dream...there was more to it I just can't explain it to make sense...So my life is all right..pretty hectic...I have so much stuff going on like I don't even get a second to myself so I'm like ahh!! lol and yea I'm sorta dating Ricky and he's really nice but I don't know I feel like I barely talk to him and that's really weird to me cause when I date guys we usually talk all the time and stuff...maybe it's cause we're not going out and he's not used to that I don't know...but I think it'll be weird for us if we go out...because we don't have any of the same friends...except for like Keith and Daniella...I don't know I think it's going to be really hard/weird but we'll see what happens...lol well I'm gunna go shower and finish my homework!!"

"event","I am sooo weird! lol I don't know I'm the biggest baby and I can't make up my mind. I don't know what I want..and I'm fine with that. Wait no, I'm not but I don't know how I'm supposed to find out what I want. LIke I'm torn I want to change things and start over but I don't want to let go in fear of tearing away what I fell in love with. And I wonder what I fell in love with, I don't know if it was the whole situation or the actual thing, which is part of the reason I can't decide what I want. And I'm like well I'll just wait it out  for things to happen  but everyday I get more and more anxious to make my life. I'm one of those people that decides their life I can't leave it up to chance or fate even though I should or at least up to God. I don't know but I can't just sit back and hope for things to happen I have to change them. But it's like I don't know how I want to change them. And worst of all I don't want to hurt anyone or anything while I figure that out. So I don't know...and it's like some many things remind me of how I want things to be but I know I can't make them like that. So to sum it up...I know what I want but I can't have that and then I have to decide between the two things I can have and I don't know if I even want either of them. So in other words it's gay. lol But I mean at least I'm happy about how things are right now, sorta. But every once in a while I still feel like crying but I don't not because I hold it back but because I don't feel like there's anything to cry about, if that makes sense (there might be one tear though) lol. But I need to stretch and then go to bed cause once again I have early practice tomorrow : (  but it's fun I promise! lol Sweet dreams!"

"event","I had a really good day today! It was really tiring though! I like woke up so freaking early for no reason : (   and I woke up without a shirt on...lol I was really weirded out, but knowing how much of a weird sleeper I am, I probably took it off cause I got hot and can't remember...but it was weird. And then I went out to eat cause it was my daddy's birthday!! It was fun...but then I went to dance and it was soooooo freaking hot!!! but it was still fun! umm then I hung around all day and then Matt called and we went to see Signs again..it was a really good movie, if you haven't seen it go see it! lol and now I'm dead tired and I have to wake up at like 6:30 tomorrow so I guess I'll go...but what I was confused about...well I figure I'm not going to worry about it I'm just going to let things happen and not try to want things to happen a certain way...but I still wish things were back to normal. Sweet dreams!!"

"event","I AM SO FREAKING CONFUSED

I seriously don't know what I should know or what I think anymore..I thought I figured it out today, but obviously I didn't. I thought I knew how I wanted things to be but everything has flipped. I'm so confused and I wish I didn't even have to think about this. I thought I'd gotten over all this stuff and those feelings and maybe it's not that I <i>have<i> those feelings anymore but I miss them? I dunno I'm scared of hurting someone I care so much about but I'm more scared of hurting myself. And I shouldn't be  cause I've already hurt myself more than I needed to but maybe I'm just doing this to forget about it. I dunno I wish things were ordinary.

Irene thinks I like her brother..she won't leave me alone about it lol but we're just friends so it's good.

"event","I thought I was really forward about my feelings and that I didn't hide things. But obviously the more I tell myself I'm over it the more I realize I'm not and that I wish things were back to normal. It hurts to wish things back to how they were when I used to think I was so unhappy before when things were normal when the were actually lovely. The only thing that gets my mind off all those things is dance, while I'm at practice nothing else matters and I wish that's how things were all the time that I wouldn't think about everything and that everything would change as easily as you can change the music in dance. ah I'm rambling...whatever I just wish I could be honest about my feelings instead of hiding them and changing them so I can seem so much stronger then I really am.

"event","""Anything But Ordinary""   Avril Lavigne

Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh myself to sleep
It's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast
Just to feel the danger
I wanna scream
It makes me feel alive

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please

To walk within the lines
Would make my life so boring
I want to know that I 
Have been to the extreme
So knock me off my feet
Come on now give it to me
Anything to make me feel alive

Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.

Let down your defences
Use no common sense
If you look you will see 
that this world is a beautiful 
accident turbulent succulent 
opulent permanent, no way
I wanna taste it 
Don't wanna waste it away

Sometimes I get so weird
I even freak myself out
I laugh my self to sleep
It's my lullaby

Is it enough?
Is it enough?
Is it enough to breath?
Somebody rip my heart out
And leave me here to bleed
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please

Is it enough?
Is it enough to die?
Somebody save my life
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please."

I have so much going on right now like I can't even begin to describe it. Not only like stuff to do but like in my head I've been thinking about sooo much stuff..and I don't know if I should be thinking about some of it. I hate that feeling that you get <regret...that's the feeling> I wish I could've changed a lot of stuff this year...or actually had made some different decisions...but I'm all right. Things have been really good lately..I have AWESOME friends..like I've never been happier about the people that surround me then right now. I love them soooo much...they're amazing..they have this talent of understanding me when even I dont' have a clue what I'm talking about or just reading me like a book and knowing somethings up..lol you gotta love em...and I'm doing all right besides that and my sprained toe..and the shock from the killer grasshopper that attacked me a couple of days ago...oh yea I miss my mommy! but she's coming back soon! yay!"

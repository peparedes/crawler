"event","does this make sense??
i want a boyfriend.. but i don't. 
i want the comfort but i don't want the restrictions.
i want the kisses, the cuddling, the swimming late at night, and the late night phone calls.. but i don't want the crying, the jealousy, the lying, and the arguing. 

i think i need to be happy. i mean, i'm happy but i'm not. 

i guess i'm just sick of sitting back and watching everyone else be happy.

there's something missing in my life.. what the hell is it"

i'll end this with a quote i can actually relate to now..
""From now on, you stay away from me. I have wasted thousands and thousands of kisses on you - kisses that I thought were special because of your lips and your smile and all your color and life. I used to think that was the real you, when you smiled. But now I know you don't mean any of it. Shame on me for kissing you with my eyes closed so tight."""

"event","He is my Noah to Ally, my Romeo to Juliet, my Jack to Sally, my Prince Charming to Cinderella, my Eric to Ariel, my Beast to Belle. And I love him just as much, if not, more. But in every movie, they have their obstacles. And to be what everyone else has and what we want, we must go through these obstacles, and finish through fighting, or we will never be anything remotely close to what we want. That's what makes relationships... the obstacles you overcome as a couple. <br>
<br>
When he told me he loved me again, it was like everything I wasn't feeling at the moment, rushed back into my body and took me over. There's no way I could even try to explain the way I feel when he tells me he loves me. It's heaven.. and for those of you who don't know.. ""Heaven's not a place that you go when you die, it's that moment in life when you actually feel alive."" <br>

""I'm falling even more in love with you, letting go of all i've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move. I'm hanging by a moment here with you. I'm living for the only thing I know. I'm running and not quite sure where to go. I don't know what I'm diving into. Just hanging by a moment here with you. There's nothing else to lose. There's nothing else to find. There's nothing in the world, that could change my mind. There is nothing else... there is nothing else."" <br>

Do not ask if you can have my heart, for it has been ripped out, trampled on, ripped to shreds, pieced back together nicely, and stabbed right through the core.

I swear to God, if you hurt me, I will do everything in my power to make sure you die the worst death possible. I do not forgive and forget. I do not let lies slide. AND if you break a promise, I will break you. Use me? I'll use you right back. I sound bitter? Well then screw you! You have no idea.. not at all.

fuck you, fuck him, and fuck anyone who thinks it's ok to fuck with peoples hearts. i don't even fuckin have one anymore. but, don't you forget.. i've taught myself to be strong. and i will always win in the end. don't fuck with me. i'm stronger than the baddest bitch you know.

I miss you so much and I wish more than anything that I could be home for your 14th birthday. It amazes me how old you've gotten and you just get more beautiful every day. I am proud of everything that you've ever done and I hope you continue to make me proud, which I'm sure you will. I love you with all my heart and I hope that your birthday is the best one yet. We'll celebrate it all over again when I come home ok? We'll go to Disneyland or to the beach or something. I love you Kitty Cat, I always will.

"event","A man. Very scary to some on the outside but very caring on the inside with the biggest heart. He lived a horrible childhood but grew up to be the strongest man in the world. He's not afraid of anything but his one fear. He's lost loved ones but his biggest fear is losing his wife or any of his daughters. He would put his life on hold for them. He would fight the monsters in the closet or under the bed, he would take away the bad dreams, he would make sure the earthquakes didn't hurt you, he would make sure your heart was never broken, he would make sure the bullies knew better than to pick on you, he would hold your hand when you were scared to get a shot, and he would hold your head while you cried when you were hurt. He cares for nothing in the world but the happiness of his family. He would kill to make sure nothing happend to them. But not only does this man take care of his family, he takes care of others as well. He's always standing with arms wide open and taking others in under his wing. And if he could, he'd drop the world to be at my side. And I look up to him for this. Some people would think this is Superman, but this man is MY hero, otherwise known as my father. I've wanted nothing more in this world than to be just like him. Thank you for holding my hand every step of the way. If I had the choice, I'd never let go of your hand. Oh, that's right, I probably never will. I love you with all my heart.

Happy Father's Day to the best Daddy in the whole entire world.

walking home and feeling something hit your head, touching it and realizing its GREEN bird shit, therefore having it all in your hair and all over your hand..

it's absolutely pathetic how hard i fell for him. i think about him whereever i am, no matter what i'm doing. seeing his face, gives me chills and makes me smile so much.i miss his kiss, i miss his hug, i miss him holding me. i miss his smile. i wanna tell him everything but he has so much on his shoulders out there, in iraq, and i would hate if i added any pressure to him. he tells me he loves me every chance he gets. it makes me smile that he has my key around his neck. and i love that his friends IM me all the time and say, ""i love your pictures"" and ill say ""oh, he showed you haha"" and theyll say ""r u kidding me? he brags about you all the time."" yet, were not together because he says he would hate it if something happened to him. but really, it doesnt matter because i'm so in love. thats right, you heard it.. i am in love. the thought of any guy i had a crush on before i left, makes me sick to my stomach. no one compares to him.. no one. its so strange cuz i dunno what to do. im not sure if i should be happy or be sad. i am so happy, so happy that when i get home, he comes home too and we're going to start something (yeah, he wants to start it in person). but i'm so sad and so scared because of where he is. i miss him. so much. really, i think about him so much. i love him. and if i could, i would fall asleep in his arms, every night. 

in case you're wondering, his name is scott patrick meehan. he's irish. he played hockey with my cousin. he will be 25 on July 17th. (i do not give a fuck if you think hes too old for me. i think it's perfect.) he's in the Army and kicking ass everyday. i've known him for almost 5 years now and fell head over heels for him the first time i saw him. the cute thing is, he remembers the first time he saw me. nothing just ever happened between us because of age, and my ex boyfriend, joey. we've kept in touch for 5 years and have always said we're going to marry each other. back then we would kid but be serious at the same time. now, we're serious. and i love him. and that's that.

and if you're wondering.. this is what he looks like..

"event","a young girl, so full of spirit, so full of color. such a perfect figure and a gorgeous smile. beautiful green eyes and personality that most people don't have half of. but people only see whats on the outside. on the inside is nothing but a broken heart and bruises. its too bad that its broken because its a bigger heart than most people have their entire lives. she walks around with a smile on her face and handing out smiles to others walking by. her heart was on a silver platter. she watched her older sister get heart broken many times but only wanted to be loved just as much as she loved others. instead of putting a brick wall around her heart she wore it on her sleeve. and the first person who came across it, ripped it off her sleeve and threw it in his pocket. every now and then he pats the heart to make sure it's still there but he never takes the chance to actually take the heart out and make sure it can still breathe. every time he pats he just adds another bruise while she sheds all her tears of pain, hoping that everything will just be better in the end. that heart is the most precious thing in the entire world and deserves to be in sight at all times. its sad to see such an amazing laugh and smile go to waste. she has no one to share it with. he pretends to care so that he can hold her by that thread. one day she'll finally realize that there's a pair of scissors in her hand and she needs to cut the thread. you're too beautiful. you're too special to let someone bruise you internally. there are others who would take ur heart and hold it above their heads and be proud to let everyone knows its theirs. baby, don't let such an amazing heart go to waste. some people just don't realize what they actually have. you're better than that and you know it. rip a hole in his pocket when he's not looking and grab your heart back. it's yours and you don't need to give it away yet. it's too delicate.. it's too precious.. it's too unique. just wait for the one who asks for your heart and actually gives you theirs in return. 

i love you."

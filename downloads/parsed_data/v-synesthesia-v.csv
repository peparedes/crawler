"event","Well, I go away to scarborough with Youth Theatre tomorrow for the Student drama festival. No idea what to expect. Don't have a clue what scarborough is like either. It will definately be and interesting trip. Just have to make some minidiscs so I don't die of boredom with all the traveling we're doing. Am away for 11 days. Aaaaaaages.


MCR SOOOOOON. Am now seeing them at the matinee show too, so thats MCR twice in one day. 2pm and 5pm. Madness. Must not explode with excitment."

"event","My lovely emoboytwin Sally is going to buy MCR tickets pour Chloe et moi. J'adore her. Am so excited. My Chemical Romance twice in one day? Tis not to be believed. Have been listening to  first album mental ammounts. Track two is being favoured. Must learn all lyrics so one doesn't look like a total retard at gigs.

Am also beginning to master making avatars. Bwahahaa."

"event","Alright, so the parents are now in Goa. Scary stuff, right? Except its actually been relatively easy. I never really cooked/ate much before anyway, so thats no problem. The kid brother tidies up a lot (he got the clean-freak gene from somebody else, I sure don't have it) and I make the fire in the front room so we don't freeze to death. 

Mam phoned today to wish my little brother a happy birthday. I think they're about six hours ahead of us, and it was really weird to talk to her for some reason. 

I think my lipring is finally deciding to like me and not really really hurt or split the skin now, its been in about a week. Usually I can only keep it in a coupl of days before it starts to hurt, so woohoo! I'll very likely get another piercing of some sort when I got to see Chloe/MCR in April. Speaking of MCR, they're playing at 2pm again on the same day we're going to see them (April 9th). Must somehow get tickets. Must find a friend with a credit card I can borrow. Aaaaaaaaah. PANIC.

I got the Sims 2 yesterday. My goth girl shot my emo guy down when he proposed to her. Bitch. Hes going to be scarred for life now."

"event","Well ok. So I ought to post on this thing more. Thing is, journals are usually reserved for people who are remotely interesting and/or people who live remotely interesting lives. And this current moment in time, I am feeling like neither. Friends are still at Uni, unsurprisingly, which leaves Lucy all alone. With practically no social life whatsoever.

Must escape from this island. But escaping requires money, which I have very little of. To get money, one must work. I don't have a job. So first step to escapism must be to get my bum moving and find a job. Will have to wait till April however, as I am going away twice in the near future, so getting a job now seems utterly pointless if I'm not going to be here.

So, my parents disappear to Goa on thursday. For two weeks. Leaving my brother and I to fend for ourselves. Weeeeell, the freezer is stocked with food, so I suppose it won't be too difficult. It'll be a little weird, as its the first time our rents have been away without us. EVER. But I suppose its scarier for my little bro, cause two days before they come back, I'm leaving to go to scarborough for 11 days with my youth theatre for the Student Drama Festival thats being held there. 

Which will be weird. I'm the second eldest in the entire group, and the only sXe kid that will be going (Who am I kidding, most people in the group don't even know what straight-edge is. And think I'm mad because I don't drink. Idiots.). Should be interesting. I've already refused to look after drunken children, as no doubt some of them will drink plenty whilst we're over there. Puke is not nice, and I don't intend to go anywhere near people who might bring it up (Haw haw).

Then on april 7th, I disappear to the mainland again, this time with my best friend, to see My Chemical Romance on the ninth. Excitement? You have no idea. And people from the HIMonline forums are coming too, so it should be greaaaaat. <333 Can't wait. I will give Frankie the tiara I'll be wearing. Princess frankie is best.

I've lost my train of thought now, so I'll stop. I need a bath ASAP."

"event","Meh. Went shopping with mother today for christmassy things. The tack around in most places makes me feel ill, not to mention bloody christmas music. Why do shops feel the need to spoil a perfectly good holiday with a bunch of plastic shit and crappy jingley tunes? Eurgh. And mother keeps bugging me about what I want for Xmas as my main pressie.... I have no idea. I can't think of anything I really need. At all. But I keep bugging her about joining the Despair Faction for chrimbo....

Didn't actually buy much in town though, got dad a load of chocolate and random stuff, and a birthday cake. Seriously need a job. Lack of money isn't even remotely amusing. Especially considering that friends are coming home soon. At least I don't waste money on alcohol...

Baaaah humbug.

Hope ToM gets better. Poor thing."

"event","Well... My first entry into this journal. Don't expect anything I write in here to be remotely interesting. Things might pick up when the friends come back from Uni in a couple of weeks (Man, I can't frigging wait. Save me from the dullness that is my life) and after that I actually might decide to do something with my life. But I'm not promising anything. 

Sooooo... where to start. Meh. Feck this for a lark, I'm going for a shower.

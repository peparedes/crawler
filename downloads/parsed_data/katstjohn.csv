"event","Well it's been a while ain't it dear Diary.

Why? I don't know really. I have had nothing but fucking time. Infact it was driving me mental. 

You know I always fancied I was a rebel against the whole Stiff Upper Lip bullshit thing, but..I value my privacy and I need some time alone.

Only now I have a rat in my fucking head and a 24 by 7 fucking minder to watch I don't lose it and start eating passerbyes.

I scetched for a while, but can't get into the right headspace for it. So I am actualy working security at the moment. I suspect the guv just gave it to me to stop me going right off the bloody walls but hey. It's something at least. I can't really work at the moment, I meant some punters might pay me extra to lick the blood off them I have a feeling that then eating their face would not appeal to them.

Well most anyway, you meet some odd fuckers in my game.


The other thing I value is my independance. Aside from the cunt being a well, cunt feeling I weas tied down to someone was pretty fucking...I dunno made me want to scream some days.

Now I have a whole bleedin tribe of fucking people around me AND a boss. See Rat King is not just a fucking title.

Welcome to Ratdom, please turn you clocks back 500 years.

Worst thing is my inner rat doesn't seem to mind, wants to be part of things, wants to either go for the throat to establish dominance, then fawn once it loses or some shit, hard to sort this shit out. But it feels just like when you put a new rat in an established cage.

On the upside I won't get lung cancer I found out. Go me."

"event","Dear Diary,
So I have finaly met someone who gives me the horn in as big big fucking way. And who seems..fuck seems she outrgiht said it, wants to bump uglies with me...

...And they are a fucking vampire.

Fuck..
FUCK!!

I mean. Can I trust her to stick to sucking parts of me in a fun happy way, not turning me into a 6-pack on legs.

Is she messing with my mind already, is that why I am even considering it?

All I know is she let slip a bit of what she can do and I almost wet my pants then and there. But seriously I am pushing towards fucking forty, not like I am a kid having a knee-trembler out the back of a club. She could seriously fuck me up.

Man oh man, what the fuck am I going to do diary?"

"event","Alright finaly finished with the apartment. Well kind of. Bed is a fucking mattress on the ground, I got all the books out of their boxes at least. 

Shit. Seriously. Managed to scrounge up a bleedin ton of bookshelf space but still not enough. However I managed to get the giant stereo of doom up. Time to fire up Johnny and the boys and scare the living shit out of my neighbours. Earthquakes here we come.

Got a small telly and a DVD/Video player thing. They might be a little dodgy, man down the pub style. But hell they work so far.

Now I just need to start making some dosh so I can actualy afford a proper bed, although who cares. Not like I will be bringing anyone home in the near future.

30-fucking-something and single again."

"event","Dear Diary,
Well I am still here, for my sins. Shop is finaly up and running, although pretty much wiped out my savings. You know I could just have found  a place to rent some space, but no I wanted me own place. Even if it means I will be living off tinned food for the term of my natural life.

Still it looks pretty fucking brilliant. Better than what the last own did. Tit for Tat? what the fuck kind of name was that. I mean London Calling is a little naff, but better than that. Still I wonder what happened to the last bloody owner, police tape on the apartment was not a happy sign.

Which reminds me, better start work on the upstairs apartment next. Reckon I should get some rats as pets, I miss the ones I had to leave back home.

I need some customers, well ones without fur and or bleedin fangs. Although to be honest if I can get that right could be a nice little earner. Need some guinea pigs though to practice on. I figure skin is skin but who really knows?

Well as far as dating goes. Yeah right. I am about ready to totaly give up on men, but haven't met any decent single women, well who have any liking for the vagina anyway. Meh just me and my battery powered friend for a while then.

Oh I found a place that serves beer at a decent temperature. Go me."

"event","Dear Diary,
Always wondered why on earth you began these things like that? I guess making it like a letter gives you some kind of structure to the whole bloody thing.

Well my last journal was trashed by a certain CUNT that I had the misfortune to marry. Tosser. Still I left him wearing his balls as earrings and pissed in his gas tank. Well not directly, friends may joke I have a big set, but I don't have all the equipment. Anyway once I get settled I will send the papers to him so I can become the ex Mrs Wanker.


So anyway I moved from arse-backwards AZ to San Franciso. And well Fuck Me. We are pretty fucking fair from Kansas Toto. 

Of course in SF Dorothy is likely to be a vampire and Toto her happy little Pomme Frits, of whatever the fanged folks call their happy little blood bottles.

Because yes dear reader, in the land of lawsuits vampires are legal. Nice to know that something wot sees me as as kebab on legs is freely able to walk the streets, without a shitload of people with very large guns chasing him around.

Seriously, every second fucker I meet has fur or fangs.

How do I feel about it? Well just between you and me diary. Pretty Fucking Nervous. 

I mean we had these fuckers back home, but did I meet one? no. Hell I was the thing that people crossed the road to avoid, even after I took off the ten inch spiked mohawk. Now most punters I meet could use me to wipe down their arse without breaking a sweat.

Still they all seem to have a thing for pain, so might get a bit of work out of them. And well. To be fair as most people, well whatever you want to call them, seem fairly cool. Hell one was even soppy. Seriously this guy is one bad poem off mopey goth boi status.

Still give me the willies though. I try not to show it, but these fuckers seem to sense it.

Yeah so much for my big tough punk act.

Hell punk is dead anyway.

More to come, including Kat's Amazing adventures with Tradesmen, and how shoving a hammer up someones arse can motivate anyone.

Also the XXX adventures of Kat running through a full set of batteries after a fun encounter."

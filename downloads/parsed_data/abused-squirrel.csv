"event","<tt>Oh god. 
I'm scared out of wits end. I like guitar music, sure I do, and i'd like to learn how to play (eventually) but- my dad says, what are you interested in? (as in artzy stuff, because he enjoys signing his kids up into random classes so we won't be complete losers with no talent when we graduate) I stopped playing the piano, and he took my viola back to the store- so, what was I supposed to do other than watch tv? sign up for a class. I said ""I like the guitar""
""you want to be one of those corrupt children with the mohawks with the red and blue hair?"" 
""no""
""guitar's no good, that's why not many chinese teach it. chinese people don't like guitar""
do i really care at the moment? Rock is the best music out there, all forms of REAL rock. Not that shit on MTV. I want to play guitar. And not all guitar players come out with piercings and tattoos, santana (hate his style of music, love how he plays) is awesome, the beatles were good and innocent, sherryl crowe is cutesy and innocent also. There is CHRISTIAN ROCK. Isn't that innocent enough?
He then says ""ok, fine. I'll go out and find you one.""
What the fuck? Really? but i said 
""right now?""
""yeah""
then when he brings me there to buy the acual guitar, he's all pissy about the price and all the shit and he says ""you are going to give up within months, and this is so expensive so if you quit I'll kill you.""
did you not notice that I never asked him or suggested him to buy it? I just said ""I like the guitar"" And I just want the guitar, but he buys all this shit with it. It was supposed to be only 200 for the guitar, but he ended up spending 600 dollars for guitars, supplies, an amp, a bag and lessons. God, HE SAID YES, not me, the man did the talking, he did the yesing and spending I just stared at all the guitars. The guitar they picked out wasn't what I was expecting. It has this ugly wood body (I know guitars are wood, but I like the ones with solid colors like black and white or white and blue or all black, that shit.) But who cares, I have a guitar. :P
thing is now, I'm scared that he's going to bitch at me for a while because he had to spend 600 in a day, and thats what my mom makes in about half a month- because she is a house maid. I'm also scared because what the fuck? I didn't ask for this, I didn't suppect it. Its like a child, sure its a great joy but I have a new responsibilty. 

Also, I don't know how to break it out to people that now I have a guitar and I'm supposed to learn how to play it. I have to learn 'coz my dad would kill me other wise. And all the assholes at school would bitch and be mean because I'm a loser with a guitar. Sure, I am your all american loser but hey, we can play guitar too. Not only you rich people in mansions who cry when you're mom doesn't let you dye you're hair black and buy all of you're wardrobe at hot topic. They don't know me, they spill their guts out to their friends but practicly yell it out, so its no secret. and the rumors. Hehe, I learn about people I don't even know other than a name and face. (and gender :P) Fuck school, this bullcrap would be over in 4 years- when I go to collage. I'll be on my turf. 

I'm going to tell you what I got:
~Baggage of guitar stuff:
 -a Fender tuner
 -a Fender winder
 -extra Yamaha String
 -Fender Picks
 -Guitar Strap
 -Fender polish
 -Fender polishing cloth
 -Perfektion connecting cable
~Fender Amp (15) 
~Ibanez Guitar
~Ibanez Guitar bag
~lessons with some guy named ""Danny"" at the Music and Arts store. oO;

I would love to go get my lip pierced, but for my dad's sake (not the Japanese rice wine!) - I wouldn't. Just alot of ear piercings and two tattoos. :D (hehe, those tattoos would have to be well hidden, but these would mean so much to me, thats why I choose to have them.)"

"event","<tt>I'm too lazy to write out another story, so I'm going to ctrl+c my post from earlier 

Tell me, would you turn down a fight, just because someone was bigger than you? Would you crawl between someone's leg because he has a pocket knife? Would you say someone was right, because he is in charge? I know I wouldn't, but god. My dad says you have to play the bitch because you want to survive, and personally put up a fight before I give up, I'll die before dishonor. He just thinks everything is facsist, and if you go against something and stand out, you're going to lose in this world. 

Today I got into a fight with him so he smacked me with a cane, and I said, ""alright c'mon"" And he started bitching about shit and continued hitting me with the cane. I'm seriously became tired of ending up at these situations, so I just cracked today. Then about 10 minutes later, he said he did this because of the above. Honestly, it had nothing to do with that. He asked ""am i right or not?"" And I said ""I don't know"" And I know deep inside he isn't, and if i said not he'd get more bitchier. I just want to stick in my opinion and my side of the story instead of saying ""yeah, you're so right!"" or explain why I said he wasn't right. He just thinks that I'm being a asshole.

Voila, I stuck this in the toefur forums I go to, if you want to reply to this rant, then go there."

Does anyone even reads my fucking journal?! Inform me, or I'll treat this like a real journal and stick my fantasies in here soon. ;)

I have homework to be done, it shal be turned into my french teacher in 5 hours, but I wait- I cannot sleep tonight. Insomniacs rest only on their dying day. :) 

I want to chat with EVERYONE, I want to make friends with YOU, but I don't want to, and I don't like you. :K Beat that, biznich. What the fizzle?

I hate school. They are trying desprately to fail me. They don't have to liee to me, I know I got top scores but what is keeping you from putting me in the best classes? They way you are treating me, you could just stick a lollipop in my mouth and clap when I first learn to eat without puking. God, I hate math. 

Fuckkk school. do teachers have nothing better to do but to torture kids?! I know I like being evil so I would like to torture kids, but to lie to our sweet souls that your goal is ours? c'mon, thats too far. Just say ""I'm in it for the money, and I hate children."" I find that much more relaxing and honest. :) Honesty.

I want to be british! the funkadelic accents, the groovy traditions, the kick ass boutiques!! God, I must marry a british man! (or woman ;) )

I'm stuck hear reciting my life to a bunch of 40 year old men. Fuck off, I'm out."

She looked like hell when she came with us... Cancer just- sucks. I knew some cancers killed. but, her cancer could be cured, because they caught it pretty early. Though, oh chemotherapy, and radiation with some hairloss then everything would be ok. Acually no- she mostly sleeps now and its so painful for her. She keeps on saying ""this pain is so much, dying would be easier."" She done so much to hold on, and she should. I know I would say the same, heck, at this stage I myself would of commited suicide. But she didn't, she is that powerful. I used to hate her. She would favor my brothers and pick on me, but i would talk back and bitch. I am a bitch, i know, but I should of made their lives easier. Everyone is going to die soon, i know. But- I should be so much nicer to everyone so when they die, they wouldn't hate me or what sorts. I just feel like crap- because I bet right about now she feels like crap. I know she would like to be with my grandpa right now, so it could be nicer over there. So it wouldn't be so lonely and misserble. I would so love to start over again, but with my knowlage. So, I don't have to screw up so bad.

"event","<tt> I don't fucking know. I feel always depressed, I am not without a second without this feeling... Maybe because of stress or fear, but I always end up hating myself. I'm afraid that I might do something- horrible. To myself, to someone, to something, I don't know, but its not positive. Little perfect asian girl, get good grades. No i don't get good grades anymore. Ever since I started the 6th grade, I have been more misserble than- ever. I'm not much of a cry'er because there is so many people around, and I hate being judged. But the thing is, my entire fucking family judges me and shit. thats why they hate me, I go against their crap I don't want to deal with, they end up hurting me. Maybe it was that summer vacation trip. Out to my cousin's house. People I admired so much, my grandparents just hated me, yelled at me, I was so scared and sad because they talked shit about me. I thought they liked me. Now, I'm just lost. No family and my friends- well, they aren't really friends to me. Maybe I have depression, so- what about it? If you could find the disease or what shit that is wrong with me, but you never would know how it started, never know what causes it, never know what would help- except medication. I'm a pretty healthy kid, not overweight, vegetarian, kick ass music. Its more about mental health. I fear everyone, even babies. I'm scared I might make them cry, I fear that I might be a bad influence to 5 year olds, so i try not to interfere, i fear that kids don't want to be my friends, I fear my parents would hurt me. I don't want to be hurt. But fear keeps us from what we really want. I want some real, decent friends. Friends who know me, friends who stick with me, friends who are like me, who relate. Not a kid I spoke to about my sister in a W.S. class, talking about different subjects everynow and then. I can't defend myself from jackasses. I'm a loser, yeah, a real one. Some guy comes up and yells at me, I try to ignore but its like acid buring up my insides, this hate and this sadness eating me up. I'm mainly scared for myself. What have I done to myself? I used to be straight A, healthy living, no TV, obedient, the best kid you could ever had. I feel hate and sadness weld up inside of me for years. My dad, he won't let us tell how we feel, not our side of the story. I can't tell him I hate my sister, or anything, I can't say I hate him. I just suck it up, and get whacked. Can't cry, because its my fault. Yeah, it could be my fault... but I could cry for regret, can't I? I deserve the pain sometimes, but there are other things I cry for other than physical pain. Emotional pain, mental pain. I just- feel that I really need help. I'm just so scared.</tt>"

Basicly I hate my fathers guts, and my mom is getting a tad bit annoying also (she's really awesome and nice, but she sides with my evil hideous mutilated sister of a relative, JAYNE!) Love my mommy, hate my daddy. They don't really have a use for me, except for work around the house, so I call them ""the Landlords"" 

You HAVE to agree with my dad to be on the more 'positive' side. And the most 'positive' you can get is being screamed at. And the other side includes lots of child abuse- yes, lots and lots of child abuse. He is like a jail gaurd, ""Do your fucking roles or I'll kick your ass with the next thing that can get into my hands- or I may as well literally ""kick your ass."" He can hit you with back scratchers, light bulb attachers, dusters, brooms, and sort of shit, all the way to kicking you, grabbing you, smacking you. *nods* Yeah, fun. And it can go from saying ""I don't want to eat meat, its cruel"" to me chasing Jayne with a Butcher Knife (hey, she deserved it) you can get whaps, smacks, the whole ten yards. I don't think councelors want to hear this shit, and I'm scared that something really bad might happen if I tell on my dad. My grandparents hates him (they hate me too though :P) my sibs amd I hate him (except jayne, she has to use his 'credit card') my mom is just so close to snapping (she has high tolerance, somehow) He kicks people until they get bruises, and smacks people until their arms feel as if they were smacked by a car. I would so get a digital camera and show you how horrible these things are, but fuck it, he isn't going to get one, especially when I'm going to exploit his evils.</tt>"

5. Disown my siblings, or have my parents disown me, either way fine with me
6. Go and get my very own credit card (*muhahahaha...*)
7. Find a kick-ass job (being 18 has its advantages!)
8. <s>watch rated R movies without parents</s><sub>I already do that :P</sub>

SHUT THE FUCK UP, ALREADY! Don't change the subject, and you don't know how to fight so you scream. Pleasseeee, your fight is lame; you don't even need to open your mouth. Of course you'd win with Mr. Daddy, you got those contacts through you crappy whining , crying, and moaning, don't you think you could win by rolling your eyes? You buttwipe, of course. You guys get pissed off, and do your shit, Chang way, because I'm so much better, physically, mentally. But even though I'm so much better than you, so much smarter and so many more morals, so much more correct, doesn't mean I'll direspect people. I disagree with your shit, and you can get Mr. Daddy and Ms. Mommsy to slap me, violate my rights, any shit, I'm not giving up. I'm an one man army in this fight, I always have been, so you go right ahead. You always get your way, you prissy bitch. I just want you to shut up already! I don't need to fight with you!! You could do your thing, It doesn't have to be my way, it doesn't mean I'll let you have your way, just don't mess with me. I'm sure you can get it your way just like all that BK you stuff down your putrid mouth. Fuck off already, this isn't your computer so don't bribe jenny, don't go into one of your prissy PMS mood swings. Jenny could sell out, but I'm so much more right.

<p>
Let's call this the quiet city: 
Where screams are felt as a wave of stoplights 
Drive through the streets as gunshots punctuate the night
The sides we take divide us from our faith 
And the morning dove gets caught in the telephone wire 
Asleep you set the fire in your own house 
And the night was a knife that cut 
And I'm paralyzed 
Cross out the eyes 
Blur all the lines 
Tearing this canvas from the wall 
We crossed out the eyes 
Put lines through these cries 
We pulled all the leaves from the trees that fall 
A silent dance that we did into this hospital bed 
Hear voices from another room 
It happens all the time 
But July in the sand 
Then the leaves that fall 
And counting down our days to live.... 
Drain the blood from this valentine. 
We can rise on the wings of the dove 
See blue skies getting caught in the trail of all this smoke 
We can rise like candles in the dark-yours always 
and an envelope marked with your new address 
It was the first time face to face 
I'm crossing the line 
Talking to the other side of death 
Hearing the words that choke memories into flatlines 
I'm calling your name hoping for something to wash these dreams of you away 
(can't we die!)
(memories in flatlines!)
Cross out the eyes with a set of these lines
Cross out the eyes with a set of these lines!
Fence was blown down in a winterstorm in this field
(cross out the eyes!)
Shut it down on this world into the sound
(I'll trace her!)
What can we do put a stop to the coming white days
(I loved her!)
I'm hoping for something to wash these dreams of you away
(Shut the door on this world, Shut the door on this world)
<p>
I'm starting hate neopets. Yes, I know... I'm a neopets loser. Neo-Holic, I wouldn't be playing with it anymore (yes, I seriously hate it now, and the staff stinks and aren't good sports) so after being frozen about 4 times (or even more :P) I would like to stop playing, because it lost its fruitfulness it had. It isn't as fun, and I'm so irritated. N00bs took over chatboards so there really <b>isn't anyone to hold a conversation with.</b> Gah! But, I log in, get my free stuff, game, and chat. Such a big, big losseerrr... I need to have this Neoholics Anonymous chat. So we can help each other STOPPP!!</tt>"

<u>Things to do:</u><br>
1. Homework<br>
2. Rant <br>
3. buy that Thursday shirt... <br>
<s>4. learn how to hack</s> <sub>I'll never learn.</sub><br>
5. Earn more money/get a job<p>

Being a LOSER is fun, yay.<p>
<u>Rants (rants are my personal opinion, no critisizing nessesary)</u><br>
I hate school. I hate school, I hate school. Teachers right about scare the crap out of me (especially my second grade teacher, but that was years ago) Kids that think they are punk/rockers/goths but really are those trend-followers pick on me. They listen to their crappy music, go try out to be cheerleaders, and of course, pick on me.<br> ""Hey! Do you want this??"" *shoves picture of asian girl at me* <br>
*ignores buttwipe*<br>
*puts it closer to me*<br>
*buttwipe's friend ask why would I want it*<br>
*replies* ""because she's japanese.""<p>
GAH! Japanese?! I'm fucking chinese, and if you want to pick on me, GET THE RACE RIGHT, SEA-SPAWN! And Nooooo, I don't want your fucking picture. Hey Fuck-face, want this picture? Its a picture of toilet paper, because you are nothing but a buttwipe! Go figure Chris, did you try out for this position, but you were too covered in crap to take it? Maybe next time... fucker.<p><p>
SHUTTT UPPP!! No, I'm not going to get your hammer, get your lazy ass up yourself. You big moosie, you big cheese bread. No, listen CORRECTLY HERE, FUCK YOU! I don't give a fuck what your friend thinks, your friend is just like you, and I don't want to listen to you. I don't really want to take advice from a person who's prissy ass is bouncing around and trying out for cheerleading! <br>ME: A slacker who listens to hard rock, punk, emo, and other stuff you don't listen to. COMPUTER nerd, dork<br> You and I have two different point of veiws, If I was as mutilated and self diluted, maybe... but nope, sorry!</tt>"

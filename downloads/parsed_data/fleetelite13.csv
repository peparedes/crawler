"event","It's the day before the highly anticipated and probably over-rated ""field expedition""....it's also the day before Valentines Day, in other words probably the second most day out of the whole year that I feel like I need to spend with Meg Babe!  Not to mention that I just so happen' to be 3,000 miles away.  I won't even be able to call because i will be deep in the green of the woods...for 5 whole days' which is an eternity not to talk to your sweetheart.  And while hopefully she is thinkin' of me....I will be goin' on a patrol with Chaplain and my M16-A2 just waiting for an ambush or a grenade...(some form of DEATH) to just jump out of nowhere.  Which i guess is good practice though because that's pretty close to how it's going to be when I am in Iraq.  except I will be missing her even more!  
      This was a surprisingly good week even though I had to pan everything out to try and make it work...it was definately worth the effort!  In fact I think the word ""good"" would be an under statement of the things that I have accomplished this week.  We went to the Gun Range and shot at Osama Bin Laden targets (I killed him 14 out of 15 shots), I took my last test of the entire course and I scored a 94% and I think i ended up with like a 92% average (for those of you who know me....that is amazing!) , and we also had our Seven Mile Hike on Friday and my feet didn't even hurt after words....I guess I just felt like ""The Super Powdered Toast Man"" today.  In other words I am a mess (flying backwards) but I am still getting the job done.  Hoorah!  
      When we get back from the field this Friday...the ""New Herd"" and I are going head down to Paige's house for a couple of days, you know....just get off our feet and chill for a while.  We are most likely all gunna get a tattoo together...they are not sure what yet though.  I know what im going to get but that will be a surprise.  Probably John Lennon on my left but cheek! lol.  
      This is for my princess.....read it slow and it will make sense.  Happy Valentines Day!

""PROMISE""
 
lately i've been feeling the weight of all the world's mistakes
so i made this promise to you that i swear i will not break
when kings and queens offer it all i will not take a cent
if it meant i'd have to love you less for even just one second
i would never ask you for more than you're prepared to
be asked of i would wait for you for as long as you
needed me yo if you promised me you'd come back and
remain with me until
when the tingle and the shiver both have grown dull with age
when emotions and their sentiment are suddenly replaced
with fear that there is little left to love you for much longer
i will crush the doubts and show you that my love for you is stronger
i would never ask you for more than you're prepared to
be asked of i would wait for you for as long as you
needed me to if you promised me you'd come back and
remain with me until i can't remember
what my life was like without you

I love ya babe....i hope that makes sense to you.  It's by ""OctoberWar""
And in case you were wonderin' your new nickname is ""Olive Oil"".  Hope you get it!
I got you more stuff for V-Day but, you gotta come see me to get it...
Have a good week all.   Love ya

    Always Faithful, XIII"

"event","The very trusted and very loved M-16 Semi-Automatic Rifle...this week we are learning about our ""new buddy"".  Monday we learned how to disassemble and reassemble this rifle, clean it out, and basically take care of it as if were two peas in a pod...or if your a little bit older you might know this one, M.F.E.O.  SSGT. Kodak went ahead and taught us how to love, sleep with, shoot and talk to our new buddies...essentially  ""Mufassa"", sorry to say but I was forced to replace you but, you know how it is...lol.  Some of the things that we learned and that we will have to do with our rifles' is as follows:
     
     - Do not touch your rifle...Man-handle it
     - Rifles' do not hurt, they kill
     - You will love your rifle
     - You will talk to your rifle, it may talk back
     - You will respect your rifle, and it will you
     - Your rifle will never touch the deck
     - You will sleep with your rifle
     - you will NOT, make love to your rifle
     - Etc.

  Anyways there are about a thousand other ones that we talked about but i just can't remember them all right now...at first I thought it was knid of funny but, when i realized that SSGT. was serious...it was still funny (seriously).  So that's what iv'e been up to this week. Yesterday we were .7 miles off from runnin' a 10k which is 6.2 miles which is fun but, other than that we havn't had too much PT which kind of sucks cuz im gettin real ""thick"" as my shipmates would say. We also have an extremely hard test on Thursday and it's the first one that i have actually been worried about so please be prayin for me!  We were supposed to go on the choppers this week but, somethin' got backed up and or some of the pilots couldn't make it or somethin'.  So I guess thats good for you huh Meg.  
 
  We got our first Chaplain/Student today, he is a LT.  He is also a reservist' so i won't be headin' to ""The Sandbox"" with this one but, he seems like an alright guy.  It's just really strange to be in the same class as a 40 year old and he is an officer none the less. With him bein' quite it kind of leaves an akward  balance of tension from leadership in the room because the only leaders that we do have....well, let's just say they make me want to put a hole in the wall!  On the other hand it's been a good week cuz we have had the privladge to attend two different lectures from an Admiral Lower Half (1 star) and a Brigadier General (1 star).  The difference is one is Navy and one is Marine Corps For all you little motor scooters out there.  I guess once you get in the military that is your idea of a good time, in wierd way.  

  Before I depart I want to leave you with another great verse that Chaplain Cash introduced to me after he told me I would probably join up with an infantry batallion for sure.  Joshua 1:9 ...Hoorah!

"event","Well, i have just finished the most stressful week of my life....and i feel good about it.  A lot of thing are goin' right for me for once, it's so crazy i almost don't no what to do about it but, i definately know that it is beyond me or any one around me...my blessings come straight from the sky (hoorah)!  This past Friday i had the honor to meet and hear from United States Navy Chaplain Lt. Carey H. Cash, an amazing man.  He was with the 1st Marine, 5th Batallion (the first unit to cross the border into Iraq in 2003) and he wrote a book about it.  It's about the experience he had as a Chaplain with his RP ( < thats me ) and how he and his Marines truly feel that God and his angels had a hand in every single event that took place.  It was the most insperational speech i have ever heard because it applied to me so much.  I recently found out that i will most likely be deploy to Iraq soon after i graduate from this school (FMSS).  At first i was excited, and then drained...kind of like how you get after you swim for five hours.  The sudden realization and almost everyday speeches about how i might have to step in front of a bullet and or give my life for another man and my country will make you feel that way.  The Navy like's to call RP's (me) ""Bullet Sponges"" and they expect us to be excited about it....that's where the Marine Corps comes in.  The Chaplain's speech and book made me realize the validity and how important my job will be when I am in Iraq, which is exactly what i needed to hear this week and at the very moment that he spoke.  So in an ironic way, I am proud to be in my position and ready to serve my country....but most importantly serve my God!  Incase any of would like to read the book it is called ""A table in the presence"" and it is by ""LT. Carey H. Cash""...(LT. means Lieutenant).  It will truly help you understand what our troops are doing over there and most importantly who is in control.

    The reason I am wishing for Summer, and hoping it never comes is because Summer is my favorite time of the year...the only thing is this Summer I will be in Iraq away from family, my friends, and Meg Babe.  God is really going to be using me...my only prayer is that I will submit to that and let him use me.  Being in the Military will really test your faith but, the most important thing is that if you let God use you...it will only make you STRONGER! 

    I know a lot of what i have said has been contradicting but, i feel rested and reassured in my heart that God is completely in control and right now i am almost just in cruise control...But I most definetely need all of your prayers, for strength and guidance to make it through.   Thanks for everything from that you all have done for me, I wouldn't be where I am at today if i hadn't moved to Phoenix...love you all.

        Always Faithful,  J XIII"

"event","Well, what's goin' on out in the civilian world....not that I am a top secret agent or anything but i just don't get out much anymore.  This has been a really tough week here at Fleet Marine Force training.  So far this week we have had PT (Physical Training for all you little hoorah's out there) 3 times and it's only Wed.  Talk about stressful, it never ends, but somehow i manage to amaze myself everytime..or should i say God manages to amaze me every time!  We ran about 4 miles to day and did 3 different ""triple threat"" exercises today, which if you don't know what those are.....you probably don't wanna!  We have had two 60 question exams and on top of all of this little Motor Scooter nonsense, we have to go to the Gas Chamber on Friday!  And instead of the horrible time we had at boot camp with that when they used 2 tablets...this time they use 10 tablets which is the most for any training command in the nation..so i am definetely lookin' forward to that!  Oh and if it sounds like i am complaining it's probably because i am, although i prefer to call it venting.  This way I don't sound like such a tool.  

   This really has nothing to do with Romans 14:7-8; the only reason I put that up there is because it is one of my favorite verses that has really helped me with my struggle.  And that struggle would be, going to Irag in about 2 months.  And I also put it there so if you are really interested in reading it (which i hope that you are...you should be) you will have to go and look it up, this way i will get to all to dust off your bibles and read God's word for a little while.  Also, if you all have any good verses for me, I would love to read them"

"event","""Semper Fidelis""....These are words that have been repeated so many times through out Marine Corps history, and words that now have a tremendous amount of meaning in my life!  Semper Fidelis translates to ""Always Faithful"".  Even though i fronted like i did, i had no idea what these words truly meant until i joined the Navy.  God has completely renovated my life in it time and place where i thought it was impossible.  I have been in the Navy for five long months and already i have learned a life time of knowlade about things that i couldn't even have fathomed before....i say ""long months"" because it keeps me away from the things that i took advantage of before i left, the things that i truly love the most.  For example, My relative family and my spiritual family, My ""beautiful little princess"" Megan who is the best thing that happened to me next to God! And that wonderful home that i call phoenix...(that never really had a place in my heart untill i experienced Great Lakes in the Winter)!

  
  I am a ""Religious Program Specialist"" or an ""RP"" in the Navy, which translates to ""a bodyguard for the chaplain"".  So for i have some what enjoyed my military career mainly because I am becoming who i feel like God wants me to be.  Which is an amazing feeling!  I love my life and i love the people that are in it...except for ""corpsman""...(ahhh what's up DOC?) Just playin.  I have met a lot of amazing people, and they  have met me...thats what happends when you talk to people...right meg!  Right now I am at FMSS or ""Field Medical Service School""  or ""Combat Survival Training"" or ""How To Kill The Taliban"" essentially i get to do a lot of sweet stuff and meet a lot of cool peeps!  

  None of what I have told so far would have been possible if it weren't for the word of God, my bible!  It has taught me so many life lessons, one of which connected with my ""Marine Corps  Values"" which would be Semper Fidelis words that have changed my life before i joined and after i joined.  So take from this journal entry ""words of wisdom: by Jon Carter"", words that represent who i am, and who i will always be in my family, friendships, relationships, etc.  

      Always faithful, 
                       Jon Carter A.K.A. 13"

Well i worked all stinking day and then came home and me and my friend calhoun went out for me to meet this girl he wanted me to meet. She was kool but i don't think that there would be anything there i dunno i just really get aggravated with the whole girl situation it seems like the ones i actually want or have feelings are out of reach. Ive had allot of things on my mind lately and some things have happened that bring back allot of things which makes me think which is a bad thing cause i cant get things off of my mind when i do. Well im outta here later"

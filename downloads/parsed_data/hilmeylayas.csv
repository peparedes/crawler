"event","<P><FONT size=2>So here's the deal: Daniel wants me to update more, and sincee I've never been one to take peer pressure well, I told him that if he provides me with topics, I'll update about them. So every week, maybe, ideally, but probably less than that, I'll update on a specific subject. However, when constructing this idea, Daniel and I were a little worried that not everyone would find these topics interesting, so I decided to make this democratic. That's right, my live journal is now a democracy. Daniel seperated a few choices into different categories, for the primary. Then, we'll take the winner from each category (vote for one in each category please) and vote between those and that is what I'll write about. Yes, it's ridiculous, but I'm bored, and apparently, so is Daniel, at least with my journal, so this is what we're doing. Vote or else this won't work, unless there is a conspiracy against it in which case don't vote. But really now, voice your opinion. Don't let a bad topic be chosen! </FONT></P>

"event","It's Monday morning and I should be sleeping but I woke up...
Assassins is so amazing. I can't stop listening.
Anyway! So Friday Rel and I went into the city, SoHo specifically. After walking around kind of aimlessly for a few hours we get a call from Tracy, saying that there were extra tickets for her show and that she put 2 tickets under her name for us. We were really excited but we didn't really have any idea as to how to get to Pace so we made alot of guesses and ended up being right. We wait on this long line and then they tell us that the actor's aren't allowed to reserve tickets. So we wait on another line and we were almost cut but we finally made it. So that was good. Tracy was the best though and the little girl next to me kept telling me that she was too. Afterwards we saw Jenny, Lexi, Nancy Lush, Ellen, Trace, and even Willy! It was nice to see all of those Steffi faces again.

Sat: I went to the March for Women's Lives in NYC with Angel. It was a really nice walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. It was alot of fun and I'm glad I did it. It was cool to be a part of that. When I got there in the morning I realized that I should have told Dana, Jaime, and Courtney about it because they're pretty into that sort of thing. Abortion real talk...good times...I miss syracuse. It would have been awesome to go with them and because guess what? We don't like abstinence, so deal with it! 
After the march we picked Becky up at Grand Central and then went over to Rachel's apartment. It was a good time. We played a really ghetto game of truth or dare which consisted of them making me do sexual things (pole dancing, dirty phone calls) while they watched me. I was the only one with enough guts to actually do any of it though. 

Umm pretty much read that fucking book the whole day on Sunday. And I'm still not done. I hate that book! I did take alot of long breaks though. Just enough time for certain surprising bits of information to be revealed to me--but I think I'm happy, which is nice. 


I think I'll go back to sleep now. I'm freezing."

"event","So finally an update. It won't actually be a deep entry but it's better than nothing, right? So lets go through my week...

Monday night/Tues morning: I went to Britty's to start our Buffy party. We managed to get through the first season. The second and third are my favorite seasons so I'm excited for our next few rounds. It was fun. I miss Buffy. It should be on more. 

Tuesday night: Rachel, Becky, Britty, Dan Tascher, and I went to see Garden State. It's such a good movie. I loved it. It was amazing. You all should see Garden State. I kind of had an epiphony (yes I know its ridiculous and Amanda you can make fun of me for saying that all you want) during/after it. The only problem is I think the epiphony kind of went away, which sucks. It also has a great soundtrack. See it. Then we went back to Britty's to do umm..nothing. The highlites of that were me making Dan chef boyardi ravioli and losing a game of hali-gali. 

Wed: I woke up at 6 so Lis (my sister) and I could get into the city by 8 so we could wait in line with Sam to get first row tickets for 25 bucks to see Aida. I befriended some Jewish boy from NJ but he was much older than me. So we got tickets. Then we had alot of time to kill because the show started at 2:00 and it was only 11:30. So Lis, Sam, and I went uptown to around 86th and Amsterdam to eat at this place called Popover Cafe or something. Anyway it was a very cute place and the food was good too. We got tasti d-lite and then went back to Times Square and saw the show. It was good. I had seen it before but it was really different being so close. Especially because Adam Pascal had come back for the last weeks of the shows running (it closes next week). And Adam Pascal is really really hot. That was nice. Then we ran over to try and get student rush tickets to see 42nd street. I was really curious to see it because of Katlyn Morahan. We got 4th row tickets to that for 20 dollars. We had more time to kill so we walked around and then ate at ollies. We saw the show, which was good. It was a little lacking in plot and the costumes were a tad blinding but the tapping was really good. 

Thurs: After trying to make plans with Evan and Matt for ages it really wasn't going to work. Plus Matt had told Ross that he would hang out with him as well. So Evan didn't want us at his house and we didn't have a ride back anyway. But then we could go to Dan Tascher's house but we still didn't have a ride back. So then Matt says that we should all go into the city and hang out with Ross. So we were like okay. But then we got a ride back but it was too late because the plans were made already and Matt was on his way. So we went into the city and met Matt and Dan, who Matt had picked up on his way in. Then we picked up their friend Jordan who then picked up his girlfriend, Sarah. So what was once 3 ppl going to Ross's was now 6 people going to Ross's, which took Ross by surprise and was funny. Then we decided to go to L'Express which didn't card us but I didn't buy anything except dinner to share with Ross. Jordan, Dan, and Sarah got drunk though which was pretty funny. It turns out that Sarah knows an old cam friend. Then Jordan and Sarah left and Matt, Ross, Rachel and I took a drunk Dan to Dan Lederman's house where we met a bunch of people. That was kind of boring though so we left. It was fun though. 

thats all for now. I'm sorry this was a really bad, boring entry."

I'm posting from Syracuse University. I'm having fun so far but it's soo incredibly draining. I'm completely exhausted. I've made a bunch of friends. Most of them remind me of other people. One of my closeset friends katie reminds me so much of Emily and then Dylan kind of reminds me of ben and its really sad and I miss emily and Ben.
But Katie and Dylan are cool too.
I haven't talked to anybody in so long. Especially my friends who are away. I miss you allllllllllll. 
Not so many hot guys though. But there is this guy from Turkey who's pretty sexy...
I have to go to dinner.
Tiredness! meh.

"event","so I wrote this whole long entry about like what I did during the month of june and then it got lost. Sooooo mad! It had this whole long thing about ccy and meh...

I miss my friends..

Anyway.
I'm leaving to go to a program at Syracuse University tomorrow. There. I finally said it. I've really been resisting it and I think it's because of CCY. I have such a love hate relationship with that place. I made so many amazing friendships. Sadly, I've only kept about 3 or 4 of them throughout the year. But I know that if I was together with somebody like Sarah, who barely remembers me but was one of my best friends while there, or anybody really, it would be so happy and not akward. Like how it was with Ben and Emily. It seems so unfathomable that I'm not friends with so many of these people who I love so much still. I don't know if I can go through just losing friendships like that again. 
I also really regret alot of the things I did at CCY. But, if I were given the chance to go back and change things, I would probably not decide not to do the things I regret. I learned a lot from those mistakes and became a different person through them. Not to mention I wouldn't be friends with about 3 of the 4 people I still talk to if I hadn't done those things. In fact, I might try to start do the things I regret earlier. I guess I don't really regret these things. But I do. Or just every cloud has a silver lining. Maybe I'm just a very confused child?
But I'm going here because I guess lack of other things to do. My parents did not want me going to a community service program (""I'm not paying a ridiculous amount of money for my child to live in poverty conditions""). I didn't want to not do something this summer and then a lot of things you have to be 16 for and I'm only 15. 15 sucks. You're like almost there, but too bad, you're not!
I talked to someone who did this program and it seems really different than CCY. It's like less restricting but more restricting. Again, I'm confused! But I guess the point is that I will make new friends (hopefully) but they will not replace my friends from CCY. I will not let them. I would never replace any of my CCY friends. They mean so much to me, even if I have not spoken to them in like a year. I love you guys, although only two of you are possibly reading this. I love you two especially. I had so much fun seeing you guy and I hope we do it again. I will never experience anything like CCY again. Ever. 
So I'm going away tomorrow night. I'll post my address here tomorrow. I love all my friends from everywhere and this is just another summer of my life, not one that will override all the other previous wonderful experiences I've had at Buck's Rock and CCY."

The Ani concert was really good. It made me happy.
Britty's camp friends are really nice and I like them and I liked dancing in the rain with them.
I also like strawberry lemonade from Starbucks. Especially when its not on the menu but your special so the people offer to make it.
When your wet but everything around you is dry it's not very fun anymore though. 
I saw somebody from my nursery school/temple on my train. It was cool. But I didn't say anything and neither did he. I also saw someone from bucks rock/dance. Weird. I kept staring at her and Britty got mad.
Then we heard it was Dobbs Ferry and we both looked at eachother thinking ""hey, isn't Dobbs after Hastings? oh shit!"" so we got off at Dobbs. It was funny, a strange man starting talking to us.
We also had our personal space invaded on the subway, which was really really scary.


Agh and then I got home and I was wet and everything was dry and she pissed me off so much! I hate compulsive liars damnit. Why is that necessary? And I hate compulsive flirters who are just obnoxious about it. I can be really flirtacious but i try and not be and at least I'm not that obnoxious about it. thats deffinetly not how you spell that though. Deffinetly too.

I haven't had a real entry in such a long time and it makes me sad. Its just, I don't know, I haven't been able to put my emotions into words lately. 
I've been feeling nothing and have been feeling everything at the sametime and it makes no sense.
Heh, looks like I still can't put my emotions into words lately. It's not like I'm ever really that coherent. 
Is coherent a word? Or is there just incoherent to mean the opposite of coherent?

"event","Tonight sucked.
Try being in a house with about 45 other people--only about 6 of them your friends with. It sucks. I did try. Maybe I could have tried harder, but I did try. But honestly, am I supposed to go up to people who I've never hung out with before and never talked to before and try to make friends with them? Among the 43 people I'm not friends with are basically all friends meaning that I was the minority meaning that they should try to talk and be nice and friendly and welcoming.
I feel like I shouldn't even bother to try and make friends with these people because I know that no matter how hard I would try, it most likely would not work. I just wanted to scream the whole time. Kyle and I actually tried to introduce ourselves to two new people and they were like ""uh Hi"" and then continued talking with eachother and looked at us like we were crazy. 
Alot of people looked at us. It was annoying. I can't interpret looks from strangers. This one person who I have never ever talked to and I mean like NEVER--he's never even aknowledged my existance, I don't really know his name and I highly doubt he knows mine--kept looking at us and smiling. It was strange and confusing.
However, a few good things happened tonight:
-I made a new aquaintance but that's only really because we went to the same camp--yet she never knew I existed until tonight.
-Somebody in one of my classes (not in my grade though) who never says hi to me or smiles at me in the hall said ""hello Hilarie"" to me. It was weird though. Hello Hilarie?
-I talked to two other people who seem cool but I've never talked to. I actually only talked to them for like three seconds though.
-I had fun in a circle.

anyway
now I'm really lonely and wish I didn't have dance tomorrow morning. Why the fuck do they have a 9:30 ballet class and why in hell do I take it? I could be at Britty's having fun with my friends right now. Instead, I'm being ground from the internet and wishing I was cooler. 
Which makes me so much more un-cool."

If there is one thing that I don't understand in life (besides my Hojoo...) it's how those crazy things that the Bible says we, women, sprung from the rib of, work. Its just unfathomable to me why they think the plainest, most ordinary girl is hott, when they don't even aknowlegde the most beautiful and extraordinary girl's existence. Does this make sense?
And does all the testosterone make their brains unstable, causing them to constantly change their mind? Honestly. One minute a guy will go on and on about how much he likes you and how much the mixed messages that YOU are giving him depress him and then, but a minute later, he will be hooking up with one of your close friends behind a tree. You think one's really into you--everybody does when they hear what this boy says to you--and then  he'll say something that greatly implies that you are not his type at all.
I just don't understand."

"event","So she called me and told me her plan for happiness. Sex. Lots of random sex. I thought that it was ridiculous. Casual sex would not--could not make her, one of my beautiful best friends who is all-too-good-virginal-completely-inexperienced-never-drank-only-smoked-pot-about-four-times, happy. In order to be happy, I thought, you need something more substantial, like an actual relationship--a significant other.

But now as I think back to that night when I eagerly listened to her explain her idea and scoffed at it in disgust, I think maybe I was wrong in doing so. Could casual sex be the answer? If we were to cut ourselves off from all emotional attachments, would we still be satisfied due to the occasional orgasm?

So much of unhappiness is due to heartbreak, grief, hardship, and betrayal that is somehow related to a significant other, not to mention the guilt and sorrow one feels when they are the one causing the hardship. So why do we even bother? Without relationships there would be less restrictions, less opportunities to hurt someone or yourself. So whats the point?"

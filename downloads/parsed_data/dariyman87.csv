"event","<p>Right now I am in Machias, Maine and got back from my grandfathers funeral service. So many great memories and its hard to deal with. My girl friend is in trouble and I am so far away. =( I miss her more then anything now but i know that she will be there when I come home, I just wish that we actually lived together so I could really come home to her. I miss her smell the most, I miss her voice, i miss her beautiful eyes that make my stomach squirm. She is the only girl that gets my heart beating faster, and slower at the same time. Today was really weird, I was sad and happy at the same time, sad that my grandfather passed but happy that&nbsp;I get to go home to my lover TOMORROW!!! I wont go to bed tonight i will stay up all night and sleep in the car. Ugh I have 3 days worth of math homework to catch up on =( im NOT looking forward to that at ALL! =(&nbsp; I see my grandfathers ashes and its hard to believe that everything that was him is in that little thing.&nbsp;<br />I cant wait to get home to my life and get everything straightened out in life for once i am seeing clearly now!<br /><br /><br />As always,<br />Casey</p>"

"event","<p>ive been feeling so odd the last few days and i dont know why. It hurts me to see that sometimes nobody cares about me and i feel all alone at some times.<br />My girlfriend i love to death but sometimes she drives me f****** CRAZY!!! and i hate how it always has to be about her and what she wants to do. When ever we watch tv it has to be what ever she wants to watch and i never get my ""me time"".&nbsp; I do love her with all my heart but like everyone some things annoy me. I do things sometimes that annoy her too but instead of fighting about them i wish that we will both just take eachothers feelings into consideration more often. This girl is the most amazing one i have ever met and probrobly am ever going to meet and i just want us to get along. I hate how she cries when i dont want to do something, I dont hate her i just dont want to do something. IS THAT SO WRONG? ISNT THAT OUR RIGHT AS HUMAN BEINGS... to have differences. thats why i love her because she is different. but i wish that she really really would take me more seariously and stop with all these ""jokes"" she is always doing. they are only funny to her... sometimes they are funny but other times she is the only one laughing.. "" Its Only Fun If Its Fun For Everyone!"" thats one of my all time favorites from that kids show with the big sloth dude that sings and there is a froggie and a fishie and monkeys ha... i was watchin tv early in the morning ya know.... '<br /><br />Switching Gears<br /><br />Casey's New Rule<br />The Television industry should put better shows on late night/early morning&nbsp;like 1am to 5 am. All there is on is F**k**G Infomercialls and i HATE them, well it is a clever scheme if you think about it. I have caught my self saying wow just set it and forget it eh? then i am like F************C**************k&nbsp;&nbsp; i fell for it then i turn off the television and cry myself to sleep.</p>"

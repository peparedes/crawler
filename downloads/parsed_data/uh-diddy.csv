"event","Hey guys! Well, first of all, thanks Jade and Alissa for inviting me to your parties...Its kind of a late thanks but a thanks all the same. Second of all, graduation was so much fun!!!!! Bob Celebreeze did pronounce my name right (atleast in the American way) and I am thankful for that...It was great to wear the cap and gown and recieve the diploma and walk on stage...Man, that was so cool!! The all night senior party was great!!! They had so much cool stuff to give away: iPods, Cameras, Dining sets, CD and MP3 Players, tickets to various things like Ski lifts and what not, watches, sunglasses, shirts and a whole bunch more than just that!!!! I did not win anything coz I was playing DDR and ping-pong half the night. I had 7000 bucks (play money) which I gave to Stuart and that's how he won the MP3 Player...haha, sorry but I just to say it! 

This has been such a long week...it seems more like a month since I returned from my rotary tour. I've talked to those guys twice till now and yesterday, they all left for their California tour...Man, I miss them! Hmm, well, nothing else is too new. I have just one more week left and then I am off to Canada. Fun, I guess. K, that'd be it for now. Keep commenting!"

<P>Well, today was the last day of school and it made me kinda sad to think that I'll never be in those classrooms again with all the students or teachers. Its kinda sad the way everything's ending.

"event","Ok, so I am back from my District Tour and let me tell you it was so great! I had the time of my life there with all my exchange student friends and it was just absolutely fabulous! Its weird, how I the things I don't wanna do always turn out to be so great! I didn't wanna leave India, but I did and now I am doing so great. I didn't wanna go on the trip but I did and I cried while leaving all those guys. Seriously, its so hard to say goodbye to someone you don't know whether you'll see again...I love those guys so much! None of us could stop hugging...I am kinda depressed coz I am missing them a lot right now. I don't even wanna think about saying goodbye to all you Moscow people. Its gonna be so difficult. 

Well, my trip...let's see. On 25th, we left for Spokane where we were picked up by the bus. We headed to Trail, British Columbia and spent a night there. Then we went to Creston, British Columbia and spent another night there in a school gym. Sleeping with everyone is so much fun!!!!! We slept like only 4-5 hours every night. Then, we went bowling. Man, Rotary is awesome! We didn't pay for ANYTHING except for the shopping. It was all paid for, so that was cool! I loved it!
After that we left Canada and went to Sandpoint, Idaho. It was fun there and we walked about the whole city in a game called 'walkabout.' Sandpoint is nice. Green and pretty...
After that, we went to Tri-cities and man, that was the best part I'd say! There was a boat ride and that was pretty darn cool!!! I was always in a group of 8 friends; Alex, Pierre and Damien (France), A.J. (Germany) Annu (Finland), Amit (India), Mariana (Brazil) and me...These guys were absolutely awesome! Man, I miss them so much. 
Yea, well, after spending 2 nights in Tri-cities, we left for Spokane for the conference! The conference was so cool!!! The first day we arrived, we went to the mall and hung out and watched a movie called Madagascar! Haha, it is so funny...We had fun with that!!! Then we attended the conference (boring, people just talked and gave awards we had no idea about) and got ready for the talent show on the next day. I did my Indian dance and a little Eminem rap with Damien. I sang it (seriously, no kidding, I learnt the Lose Yourself song by heart) and Damien played the guitar. It felt awesome! 
Later that evening, we went to the world's most boring soccer game and America beat Canada by 3-0!!! HAHA! ;) Actually, in the world soccer cup or something, America beat COSTA RICA too!!! The guy from Costa Rica in our group was so depressed...hehe, but he got over it. Then we had an awards ceremony for best smile and stuff like that. I got voted for most talkative girl...*big surprise* hehe...that was fun! Then we had a deejay party and danced all night long!!! Man, that was so much fun!!! After that, came the last day. We stayed up all night again, atleast most of us did. So I was completely zonked when I got back to Moscow. 
Yesterday morning was so sad...Everyone left and it just ended. We kept telling each other we're gonna meet again but deep inside, they know it's remote. I really want to visit France and meet those guys and I am pretty sure I will one day...DEFINITELY. Amit lives in Nasik (quite near to my town) and something tells me, we're gonna be good friends! Hehe...
So, yes, this tour was great. I will always remember this...I think its prepared me somewhat for going back. I've had going away experiences but this was the first coming back. To be really honest, it is depressing but I know I will grow out of it. I am happy to be back in Moscow and it was awesome to see everyone at school again! 14 days left dude...I had my first final today and I lost just one point. So it was great! I am in Geurtsen's class right now and chilling out. 
Well, this was a long one, so I'll stop now. G'bye and keep commenting fellows! Lesson learnt - Saying goodbye is difficult..."

"event","Well, I feel proud of myself. I have all my crap done for the tour except for the english dossier, which I will turn in tomorrow. My Accounting test went fairly good, so all is well, except I am going on the stupid Rotary district tour, that I don't want to go on!!! I so wanted to stay in Moscow. I got my camera today to click pics but the battery died, so I couldn't do that either...Guess I'll have to do it after I get back! So, right now I am in the library and Adam is sitting next to me. He's poked and tickled me a lot and I have laughed and flinched a lot too! Hehehe...I am gonna miss everyone for till 5th June...Geez! Special love to mom and dad in this last entry. I will mail you after I get back! Ya, well, I guess that's it then. See you guys at awards night tonight. Oh, by the way mom and dad, I am getting an Award here for something that I am not quite sure about. hehehe...oh well, as long as I get it! Whatever the reason might be...! Ok, then, bye guys. Last day of ballet today...its sad almost everything's coming to an end...hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii (that was Sarah D.) Ok, a final bye now! Keep commenting!"

"event","Hi everyone. I haven't updated in a while so here is an update. Today was quite exciting. I turned in my stupid Govt. Take Home Final and got 15 extra credit points!! Fun! I also went to the Moscow CourtRoom today and saw a case where this guy admitted he was guilty of posession of Methamphetamine and Marijuana (drugs) and of battery assault, that is, he spit in a police officer's face and ran away from the scene of crime. It was cool to see the whole case and actually have the things I learnt in government to happen right before me. The guy looked liked he was high even in the courtroom but he denied it when asked by the judge. So he is sentenced to 30 days of prison and if he reforms he'll be on probation and treatment and if not, 6 more months of prison and then probation. It was kinda depressing, seeing someone getting convicted just like that. It must be hard being a judge and convicting people everyday...Wow, some people'd love that though. Hmm, anyway, my life is pretty cool. I talked to my best friend Aditi, in India yesterday and both of us were very happy to talk to each other!!! I miss her a lot...Well, I am gonna see her soon now! I also talked to my mum for mother's day and that felt completely awesome!! I miss her a lot...and dad too! Ya, well I've probably said that for about the 100th time now! hehe, so I'll shut up. I've just finished and Accounting test and I don't think the written part went too well for Noonie! ;) Hehehehe...It was fine though. I am hoping to get like an A- coz I did good on it. Hmm, well, anyway, the class is about to end. So I'll wrap up here. Bye for now and keep commenting!"

"event","Today was kinda tiring. I did 2, yes TWO government take home final questions today. They were 2 pages long each (the answers I mean) and man, I feel proud of myself. I also performed today at the Mormon church. I did a different dance this time. It was short and sweet. Vighnarajam, mom. People liked it and that made me happy again! Its always so great to have people appreciate your performance. Its encouraged me a lot and I have more confidence now. Thank you everyone!!! Hmm, I donno what else to write. I don't really have anything interesting to say except that...well, never mind. I feel a little tired now coz of all that dressing up and dressing down. I miss my mum and dad. And guys today, I have one month and one week left to leave Moscow (Hog's Haven)!!!! Hehe...For my Indian people, Moscow was called Hog's Haven sometime back, which is funny and interesting. Thought I'd tell you. Okay then, I guess that'd be it. Bye folks and keep commenting..."

"event","At ballet yesterday, this girl who's in my class came up to me and asked me out of the blue whether I believe in god. I said no. ""Oh, then you're gonna burn in hell..."" came the reply. I stared at her and said ""umm...ok?"". At that she said, ""I hope to see you in Heaven though,"" at which I said ""Ok, I'll see you in heaven then."" So the girl says, ""But you don't believe in god. So you're gonna burn in hell!"" So I said, ""Ok, I'll burn in hell then! God, girl what is your problem?"" She was kind of the person who believes that god is responsible for anything and everything that happens, for example, I'm typing this in LiveJournal coz of god. Doesn't that conflict the concept of god? I mean isn't he supposed to look after everyone equally? Its kinda like 'Hey, you don't believe in me, so you're going to hell however good or bad you maybe!"" 

Meh...whatever. I didn't really argue coz I knew I couldn't get my point across as she was like in 5th grade and didn't really want to believe in anything else. Its really remarkable how much some kids listen to their parents and some don't! Lol...It seemed pointless to tell her that matter was made out of molecules and atoms, rather than 'Dust of the Earth' or whatever that is supposed to be. So, yep. That was the weirdest experience yet. 

Ya, well, today was fun. I played in East City Park again with Emmett (he's the bestest), Chelsie, Adam, Ian, Nate, Erika, Kryz and Ashlee. It was a lot of fun!!! I am really grateful to everyone for not getting revenge considering how much of a brat I was today, hitting everyone with the balls! Haha! Maybe just coz I have a special Indian charm. Man, when I go back, I will no longer be 'the little Indian'...aww! But anyway, I'm pretty sure that's how most people will remember me. Well, that was kinda long. So I'll stop now.

"event","Yep, well that song is still stuck in my head...So, anyway, I am in Accounting right now (I feel very proud of myself coz I finished an assignment for 2 classes in just ONE) and so, I have free time! I have free time in almost every Accounting class. I talked to my mom yesterday (coz my calling card got hooked up!!! YAY!) and that felt so awesome. My uncle and mom and dad and aunt, as predicted completely freaked out coz they found out I have purple hair now. My uncle shrieked purple at least 10-15 times on the phone. My uncle...I love him though! He's the awesomest uncle ever!!! Mom and Dad were fine as usual and so I had a good chat with them yesterday! 

Today was fun. I am not working in the student store anymore, so I got time to be with everyone else in lunch! Kyle and I rolled down the grass and that was so much fun! It felt awesome...It's pretty today. Just right warm. Hmm, prom is coming up! I am excited about it. I am going to wear my nice Indian dress and prance around the floor. I thought prom was all formal and stuff but its not exactly a ballroom dance like I thought it was. Basically its fun, like Debs I guess. Except I'll wear a nice dress instead of a gangsta outfit!! Hehe! Ya, well, I guess that'd be it. Bye for now and keep commenting!"

I am very excited today coz I am going to get my hair colored...The purple highlights if you remember! Yep!! FUN!!! I'll send you a photo of that as well. I bet my sis is very proud of me!! Hehe...Well, nothing too major has happened. I volunteered at Young People's Art Fest today at the Junior High and my host mom turned out to be the one I was gonna help. So I helped her in rug hooking!! That was fun. For lunch, I had some strawberry yoghurt and pizza. Yummy...Pepperoni pizza is always yummy to eat. I hope I get to eat in the Pizza Huts in India...that'd be cool! Ian's party was cool last night! Thanks Ian! Open Water is somewhat dumb though. As is the Labyrinth one. But they were fun to watch with everyone. So I had an awesome time! Adam showed me the Happy Tree Friends thing yesterday and the Indian telemarketing clip and it was absolutely hilarious!!! I loved that thing! Kyle and Jared Houston should see it. They'd improve on their accent! Lol...I love Chelsie and Andrew...I wanna hang out with them more often! Ya well, I gotta run now.

I missed Chelsie and Alissa at Kryz's party yesterday!! So ya, yesterday was a blast and a half!!! I don't feel like describing it any further, coz I feel lazy right now.

I performed at Lena Whitmore yesterday, but in a salwar kurta (mom, I felt lazy and anyway it was for elementary kids)...My ballet teacher came to watch me and it was so much fun! People complimented me and again, I felt very happy! There was a Japanese group performance and I am going to learn their dance. It was really awesome! It felt so great to get compliments from little kids...They really did like it coz their compliments weren't dignified or anything, like grown-ups would say even if they didn't like it! That made me feel so cool about it. Man, I am happy! 

Yesterday though, I suddenly missed my dad a lot. More than usual, that is. I just wanted that firm hug of his and encouraging words. I miss that always though. I am sure he's real proud of me and I am gonna get that a lot when I get back...I feel awesome today! Donno why...

I am thinking about how I am going to react when I go back home and see everyone again after 11 months and how they will react when they see me. It will be exciting, yes. Ok, I am having another one of those thought-gushing moments, so I better shut up. I am going to miss Mr. Crowley. He was the best student teacher ever, *no, not Jesse* and he was fun. 

I want to write more but I don't think I will coz I am blank at the moment and there's nothing really of interest. Ok then, I'll go fool around for a while now coz its open fifth! Bye bye and keep commenting!

We saw Kkay and Alex walking through the park and Mauro riding his bike. Mauro's fun to be with. So, well, nothing too major. Just having fun. Right now, Zan and I are looking at prom dresses. She looks really pretty in nice black velvety one!! Wow, I wish there were dances in India. That'd be so awesome! Pretty dresses, pretty boys *hahaha* well, not much time left now to go back to reality. This year was like a dream...really. A pleasant one. A lovely one. I kinda wanna get up, and kinda don't. Aditi, you're going over to the mixed feelings side again. No one wants to listen to that coz everyone knows it and when you say it over and over again, it becomes boring. Ya, well, it may be boring but its kinda how I feel...so, sorry if you get mad. Will try and mention it fewer times. Anyways, I think I should wrap it up now. I think I'll go suggest who Zan should go to prom with! ;) G'bye and keep commenting!

"event","Life's treating me good. I love my family. Zan is such a great host-sis! I just played volleyball with her and a few other people from the church and I felt so ashamed. Thought it was fun, I simply cannot play it! I know how to hit the ball but when it comes to me, I just dodge it. Then come to think of it, I'm not a very sporty person. Lets see...I can play badminton but I'm not good, I can swim but the way I do, doesn't count, I run and so does everyone else...and I suck at volleyball. The only thing I could do was serve, which I must admit wasn't too bad. I can play table tennis/ping pong and dodgeball though. Both of which are not very big-deal sports. I wanna be more sporty. Its good! I also wanna learn good spanish, go snowboarding again, learn to skateboard and go on short-term exchange or something again, to France or some neat place. So many things...little time. Oh well, I did a lot of things this wonderful year, I would've never done otherwise. Monica, you have to come to India. I really wanna meet you. That'd be so neat! Ok, no more nostalgia or anything else. So, on another note, I am performing on April 9th again at the U of I. For further information, ask Kira! ;) Well, I will find out the time and other stuff tomorrow for sure. So, you're welcome to come see me if there's no ticket or something. Well, you could come even if there is a ticket! Haha...I'll hope to see someone familiar though! So, anyways, bye for now and keep commenting!"

Note to my Indian readers:

The daylight saving time thing is stupid and so, the clocks are an hour ahead now. So, the time difference would be half an hour instead of one and a half hour. I hope you get it...

So, anyway, yesterday I had a nice chat with Zach and it felt pretty good coz we hadn't talked at length for a long time. aaahhh...Garcia almost caught me, but I am too slick for her! HA! Life is going great for me and I like my family!!! Zan is cool. There isn't really a lot to write except that Seattle was awesome. I missed Mr. MHS though, which I wanted to see. John Mosmon won, and I am not sure who that is.

"event","I just got back from Seattle and it was great!! The mock UN thing was so cool. At first I thought it was going to be a dud, but then when I got into it, I really enjoyed it and even co-wrote a resolution. I was on the SPD (Special Political Decolonization) committee and I represented Norway. It was fun!!! Our topics were the Russia-Chechnya conflict and the Iraq-Turkey-Iran-Jordan-Syria-Kurdistan conflict. Although, I didn't have the remotest idea of what Norway thought about this, I just gave my opinion and basically knowledgably babbled. HA!! It was fun and I made two friends: Honna and Alizeh. Alizeh was from Pakistan and I had a good talk with her about both our countries fighting and stuff. It felt really great to talk to her about that and I took a picture of us. It doesn't matter if countries fight, people can still be friends! (which is the lesson learnt). But then, come to think of it, I never hated ""Pakistanis"". Just their Government made me blow my top. So, I like Alizeh and she's cool.

Also, I am gonna get a bit on the nostalgic side now. I saw a poster at the HUB (Husky Union Building, where the conference was) that said ""Desi Dhamaka 2005"" and had pictures of Vivek Oberoi, Shahrukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai and Kareena Kapoor. There was also a poster for holi inviting Indian campus students to play and it really made me miss India. I jumped up and down all the time we were nearby the poster coz I was so happy that there was something Indian quite close. And then, all the mixed feelings came up again. I dreamt that right next to Hayes there was a street called ""indian street"" and has had all the Indian vendors selling Indian fast food and when I woke up, I was a bit confused as to where I exactly was. This dream was the best expression of my mixed feelings. The background and everything else was all American with Indian people and Indian food and an Indian me. I suddenly felt so content then. And I hope it lasts. That'd be all. Bye people and keep commenting!"

It makes me really happy that you guys liked it and appreciated it! That's what makes it all worthwhile and of course, it is very encouraging! It felt so cool to perform!!! I showed up looking like a gangster with a hat and a trenchcoat to hide my dress and ornaments...I thought (and I bet people will agree) that it would look ridiculous to cavort around the school wearing all that snazzy stuff! Finally, when I was called to the auditorium, I took it off and Shannon Jones, Ryan Asker, Jared Houston and Nick Norton encouraged me to do so. Nick Norton is such a sweet person! People really liked the dress and the shiny ornaments and that felt pretty good! Then, after the performance, Adam wore my ankle bells (ghungroos) to class, except that they were on his wrist and it was pretty funny to hear them jingle! Treefolk and Travis Hasko-Young were so awesome today!! As was Cassie Byrne with her fantabulous violin! It was cool to see them perform! I love all you people so much...I am going to miss everyone bunches! Ok, I am getting into that mixed feelings thing, so I will stop here. Bye bye folks and keep commenting!

P.S. - I am leaving for Seattle (Mock United Nations thing for International Club) tomorrow mom, so I won't be able to keep in touch with you till 3rd April.

Wow, it makes me so happy to see that people are excited about my performance! YAY!!! :D I am moving to Zan's tomorrow. So, I kinda have to get down to packing now. The good thing is, I can come back here anytime, as Zan lives only a block away and get my things that couldn't fit in the suitcases!! It was a lot of fun staying with your parents, Monica. I am gonna miss them! They were really very nice to me, for which I am grateful! :)

Hot chocolate is good. I am drinking some right now and its so yummy! It snowed today.........YUCK! Not coz I don't like snow, but coz walking to school in snow sucks! But fortunately, halfway to school, Sarah Kibuka's host mom saw me and gave a ride...So, it wasn't that bad! My dearest dad emailed me today and it made me very happy! He his proud of his lil girl, which makes me happy. I miss Nagpur...On another note, Willis Bedard is a pretty funny guy when he wants to be.

Well, school's been great for me the past 3 days. No, I am pretty sane. I FINALLY finished those stupid english journals. I liked the book, but the journaling made it boring...So there Garcia!!!!! There's this guy called Aleksander (no, its not like I don't know how to spell. That's his name) in my Computer Applications class. I was on the internet checking my email and journal, when this pop-up of ""you've won 50 bucks"" came up. He probably thought I didn't know it was just dumb, so he said ""hey, you've got 50 bucks!"" I looked at him surprised and said, ""umm...ok"", sniggered and resumed my checking. He's never talked to me before. He looked somewhat embarassed, which was funny. The thing is, I am not quite sure whether he actually took the pop-up seriously (he was grave when he said it...) or whether he thought I didn't know it was stupid...I get new things everyday here!

In my art class, there's this girl called Sarah umm...Baker? who came up to me and told me something that totally made my day. ""Phil, Sarah Kendall, and Emma were talking about you the other day and the whole Chelsie's party shower-made-palanquin thing, and we all decided you are very cute! Just thought I'd tell you!"" I smiled happily and said thank you! I felt so happy! People actually like me! :D Yay! Like I said, I get new things here everyday!

"event","I just watched an Indian movie called ""Swadesh"" (My Country) right now. Ordered it online a few days ago and it arrived yesterday.I also talked to my mom yesterday and that felt good. I also had an Indian meal yesterday. So I feel pretty nostalgic today. The film was about this Indian NASA scientist who returns to a small Indian village and improves it by bringing hydro-electricity to it. He falls in love with a childhood playmate and then returns to USA, but then becomes nostalgic and comes back for good. Normal movie-style drama. Good movie... 

But small, not-so-important things made me squirm inside. The way the actor looked down from the airplane while going to India. He was happy. Would I be too? I thought a lot. I should be. I do miss India and I love my country. I haven't seen everyone for almost a year and I'd return wiser and richer with experience. But what about America? I am so comfortable with life at the moment. Not that I dislike India or anything. I love everyone here so much. I will miss them so much. But I guess everyone will get on with their lives, go to college, get married, have kids and great careers, and live their own lives. I'll probably be forgotten. You'll try and keep contact (hopefully) but eventually it will fade. Or so it seems. I will try my level best to keep in touch with everyone. I really want to meet everyone again at least once. What would you do if you saw me, say after 10-15 years from now? Would you remember me instantly? Would you be happy to see me? I would. I hope we keep in touch. It almost broke my heart to think how I am going to feel when I write my last journal entry in America. I know I have to move on and get a grip on myself. But this is something I can't seem to let go of. I really don't know what to think.

Another thought struck me when I saw the movie. Yes, I love America. But would I settle, mind you SETTLE, here? Would I leave my country? Would that be fine with me? I don't have the answer. I want to have, both USA and India, in my life. I did have USA for 11 months. Its India for the rest of the life. This year has been a very integral part of my life. I am so confused right now. What should I feel? All I know right now is, I love both places and I want people from both places in my life. Which would not be possible I guess. 

............Will you miss me? Will you keep in touch? Yes, you."

Find me a bunch of cooler people and I will give you.......hmm, lets settle for a quarter just in case...! haha! So, anyway, I had a great time with all these neat people in Boise. 
I didn't win though. I didn't expect it either with some 40-43 people competing and me messing up everything at the last and crucial moment. If I'd done a bit better, I'm positive I'd have made it, coz my topic was simpler than any other: Cooperation and why is it important in the workplace. I felt a bit gloomy for a while, coz I hadn't done my best, though I had tried hard, and coz I had lost in an extemp contest for the first time ever. And also coz I don't get to go to Anaheim, which was my only reason for winning. But I got over it pretty soon and enjoyed the rest of the time with the neat people. 
On Friday, there was a dance at the Boise SUB (student union building) and I had such a blast! I danced till I was sweating like a pig. But marvel, I didn't stink! Maybe, coz I had a lot of deo on me...hehe! I met a few people from state drama and it was a nice surprise. *cough*Sarah Kendall*cough* sorry, someone, got a bit over enthusiastic at the dance and scared us all by getting tired all of a sudden. But then, someone got over it pretty soon and won the first place in her event, which was interviewing skills, and went back to her bouncy old self!!! So, congratulations to her!!! 
Throughout the event, I looked pretty professional, what with the skirts and chic shirts and everything else. I normally am not that subdued. My mom would have been proud! I saw a bit of Junior Miss yesterday and Kaitie Jones was awesome!!! I don't know the results though. Chelsie Benner looked dashing and really beautiful with the gown........! I couldn't stay for long coz I had returned from Boise and was tired and hungry. I think I should stop now. Pretty long entry. Bye bye people and keep commenting!"

"event","I signed up for arts fest today!!! I am so happy about that! I am gonna do a solo Indian Classical Dance piece and I am eager to perform my own style of dancing after a PRETTY long time!! I hope people enjoy it!!! :) However, I didn't get one thing. They had REALLY weird questions on the form like what's your favorite star trek episode or something, what's a dowel and what's it length, what would you wear under a toga and what's your favorite sock length.........I was pretty much puzzled by this. Why would they put it on an arts fest sign up form?? Weird! 

Well, anyway, I had a pretty good day. I think I am gonna move at Zan's place, which would be my third host family! I hope I do, but I am waiting for my counsellor to make the decision. I think I like Accounting. Mr. Crowley is nice and doesn't bite my head off. He's a fun and jovial sorta person. Or atleast, seems so. I love Geurtsen! Indian readers, he's a teacher. He's so much fun!!!!!! He has to be the coolest person on earth! For someone with such a depressing past, he's so positive! He's had divorces and other bad stuff like demoralization but he is still so strong. Great person! 

I gave Xenia bindis today. I hope she liked them! I'm gonna ask mum to send me a few more fancy ones. I didn't have many of those. So, mom could you send me some colorful ones please??? :) I got dad's letter and form today and I'll give it to Jan Leander. It felt great talking to you yesterday!! gee, I miss Katie and Shannon. I love Mr. and Mrs. Jones!!! They are the coolest people!!! I loved my stay there! I wish they'd live with me. That'd be so cool! Well, I think that would be it for now. So, keep commenting!"

I love Katie and Shannon Jones!! And they also gave me a new nickname! Addidlekins...! Wow, I wanna see my mum's face at this!!! hahahaha! so, anyway, I didn't do any homework coz I was having so much fun, and its pretty piled up now. >:/ geez! Mom, Dad, don't mail me at my yahoo id. There's some problem with it. I can't open it and if I try and send you emails, they are returned to me. Something wrong...I'm sorry I couldn't come online that day: 
1. Coz I was at Shannon's and 
2. My yahoo id wouldn't work anyway. :( 
So, I am pretty much having fun and enjoying here. Hmm, not much to write I guess. So, I guess I'll wrap up here. So, bye for now and keep commenting!"

"event","I've had so much fun today with the other exchange students today. Marjon from Holland, Adelaide from France, Maria from Columbia, A.O.Hey (that's what we call her) from Argentina, Mauro from Brazil and of course me, Aditi from India. WARNING: LONG ENTRY!

Although I am really tired right now, I still couldn't resist updating my journal about the marvellous jazz fest!  My day started early at 6 'o' clock and my counsellor drove us to the Mormon church, where the competitions were to take place. I burst out laughing when we entered coz there was this sign right on the front door : THIS IS A PLACE FOR WORSHIP OF GOD. NO SMOKING, DRINKING, TEA OR COFFEE. I knew that they detested caffiene but it was pretty funny to read that! We had decided to volunteer and hence, get a free ticket for 2 shows. So, I got to miss school today. But I worked the whole day instead and I mean it. I took up the responsibility of the 'escort' and my job was to tell people where to go from where. I thought it'd be pretty easy. I continously repeated like a skilfully trained parrot, programmed to sound pleasant. ""Ma'am/Sir, your team will get 20 min. to warm up and then I'll escort you to the performance room. When you're done with that, I'll take you to the critique room where you'll be evalued. All the best for today. This way please..."" Easy...? Not when a new team arrives every 20 min. and you have to carry their sheets to the judges. It was pretty exhausting running around the place with a horde of more than 25 people or so, behind me. However, it was totally worth it coz I got a free pass to the concert, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I fooled around with my buddies of course, which was also fun! I got a label that had my name (Dani, just so they would get it) and that felt cool!

After tireless toil *exggaration somewhat* of about 5 hours, we headed out for lunch to Downtown. Sarah and Ian came there and I was happy to see her! She recognized Adelaide from France and talked to her for a while. After they left, we had lunch at Quizznos Sub. Hmm...pretty good. Then we fooled about, going to the mall and stuff where I ran into Sarah and her mum again! Sarah was shopping for her jazz fest performance and she had picked out a very cute skirt! I hope she got it. It was good to see Kathy after a long time. Gottschalks was having a sale, so I thought I'd get a new pair of some cool footwear! Hahaha, that was just to scare my parents coz they're fed up of me buying shoes and sandals all the time! But yes, I did get a new pair of pants which I needed badly, for only 12 bucks!!! Great deal!!! Then we collected our FREE, yes free, did I mention free, oh ya they were free, tickets!!! Coolness...And at last we headed off for some well-deserved reward! THE JAZZ FEST! Boy, was it good!!! Ben Walden is so very ridiculously brilliant at playing harmonica!!! To think he's 13...And my association with him suddenly struck me. We had been on a rafting trip together with Mauro and my counsellor and he was such a prat! babble babble babble...All anyone ever said to him was ""Shut up Ben!"" jokingly of course...I simply cold not believe it was THAT Ben Walden who was on the stage! That kid is so talented! I screamed myself hoarse, cheering after he was done! And then, there was  this about 45 something year old guy from Ukraine who did something so amazing with his guitar!!!! He didn't strum where people usually do. He strummed on the handle and he tapped the body of the guitar, so it didn't seem like he was playing one!!! It was so freaking marvelous! I screamed myself hoarse once again! After that, the tempo of the concert went down and it was already 11:30 and we left, with me freezing as usual! :) I enjoyed it so much!!! I'm go again Friday night! 

Well, a very happy 100th birthday to Rotary! My dad must've been busy in that I guess. My counsellor had invited me to go to the special club dinner but I was in my right mind so I said no. hehe! After all, no one was going! So anyway, I had a pretty great day today. If only it didn't tire me so much. I should go to bed now. Its 12:30. And I have school tomorrow. So, bye for now and keep commenting! :)"

"event","well well well...another Sunday. I had a great brunch (...that's something between breakfast and lunch) today with Debby and Bill McLaughlin. Mon, your dad's a very great cook!!! I am glad I was placed in your family! :) Also, there was a pretty cute guy called Connor who also came with them. He's a student at the U of I and he was fun. Life currently is great. I talked to mom yesterday and that made me feel a whole bunch better! I miss her...She's such a great person. I wish she was here with me, so she could see 10 years of maturity in me, all gained in one year. Something I couldn't have possibly achieved in India. geez...feels like I've mutated...only the result is better instead of worse. I suddenly miss Dad a whole bunch right now. Not like I didn't before; just more than usual. I wish they moved here and lived with me. wow! That'd be great!

Well, anyway, I still have to go do my stupid english homework thanks to Garcia!!! Is that it...? No wait, one more thing.

DISCOVERY OF THE DAY : Bagpipes are horribly irritating after a few minutes. 

Yep, that's it. So keep commenting!"

"event","Hello everyone. I am doing pretty great. Jared, Kyle Miller and I had a very very entertaining and interesting talk today which made me laugh so much I thought I was going to faint!!! hahaha! They are so funny! School's great, so's ballet and I have a good news!!! My sis is pregnant! It was confirmed yesterday and I am jumping with pride and happiness!!! My sister rocks! I bet everyone in our house is pretty much a foot or so above ground! I love ya sis! :)

Well, the four-day weekend is coming up. I'm not too excited about it but glad all the same to get a decent amount of time to do homework. I really dislike my english teacher, Garcia. What does she think we are???? Machines or something??? Bleh! I don't like her. But whatever!

Today I got an email from mom asking me to finally decide my return date coz it's high time I do that now. I felt a bit sad. I love this place. Its done a lot for me. I can and will never forget this year. I feel a bit sad now that my return is coming nearer. Not that I'm unhappy to go home. It'll be pretty exciting to see India again. But it'll be sad all the same to leave this place and leave all you wonderful wonderful people behind with only a hope of seeing you again. I will miss you all so much! Makes me a little sad to think so. But then, I am also excited of going back. Seeing everyone again. This has been THE best year of my life till now! aww...I feel gloomy now! Why do all good things come to an end? Why can't they last forever? I wish they would. Then life wouldn't be so complicated. And then it would be easy. And then it would be happy. And then I would be satisfied. And then everything would be great. 

Am I dumb or what...

I miss my dog. Chelsie and Ryan Parks and I had a pretty good conversation about pets today and that reminded me of my dog. His name's Steve and he's a huge german shephard. I rode him at times.

"event","Well, a very happy valentines day to everyone. I got 3 valentines today...relax my Indian readers, they were girls. Alexandria, Erika, Emma and Tanna. Tanna gave me a bunch of sweet candy and I liked it. I love her...There is a lot of hype about V-day in India. It is referred to as 'obscene western culture' which is really very dumb coz I didn't see anything obscene in USA itself. So, mind not guys! I still have straight Sadie hair (the dance by the way, totally rocked) and I love Katie Jones for being so nice! I am really happy since yesterday coz my sis gave me very good news. However, I am not sure whether to post it coz she might get a lil mad at me! I am missing her a lot at this point. Well, today was not much of an especially exciting day. Just normal. So, anyway, I am pretty happy. Life is presumably rocking right now and I hope it remains that way. Well, I guess that'd be it. Keep commenting!

p.s- im sorry i didn't come online this morning mom coz there were was no electricity (which by the way went out for the first time since I've been here...to think there's gonna be 3 hours of no electricity when I go back! shoot...) :("

She gave one to Lyndon as well that said have you hugged your Canadian today. Needless to say, I got hugs from everyone. She has a thing for foreign kids it seems! haha! She also paid for something I really really really love...*sigh* I have no words for gratitude for this!!! Emmett took some great pics of that! I love Emmett...Seeing him and Alissa together makes me really happy! They look really cute! :) And also, Shannon's helping me get ready for the dance tomorrow!!! I am so excited about Sadies!!! I can't wait to get there on the dance floor and rock till I drop! Shannon is the best Irish with glasses evvvver!!! :) So, anyway, I am going to a little gig tomorrow at 10 A.M, then go to Shannon's, then go to the all school play and then SADIES!!! O ya ya ya...I hope they play some really great songs! It's gonna so good tomorrow!!! Well, I guess I'll stop here for now. Keep commenting!"

"event","Well, I had a pretty fine day. I loved Emmett's scottish skirt and now I want a set of bagpipes!!! Wouldn't that be happy?? And I'll have some caffiene before I play them! haha! Well, I like Celtic music...(bagpipes are used to play celtic right?? or atleast I think so.) I amm listening to some right now. I have to do so much english homework. Bleh...I am so happy coz I snowboarded! I came to know lotta people avoid it coz it's sorta extreme and I felt great about that!! It's so much fun. I hope to go again sometime. Most likely after 50 years maybe...? hehe, no snow in India you see. I kinda like it except for the cold part. But I was pretty surprised myself when I actually sweated (no joke) when I up there in Rossland in a temperature of -7 celcius. Made me feel really good!!! To think I felt cold in India...haha! just kidding! I heard a couple of Brenden's improvisations yesterday and they were really really good. It was actually difficult to believe they WERE improvisations! They sounded so good! I hope you guys are coming to the gig on saturday! 

I simply must clean my room today. I doubt making a bigger mess in India! Sorry Monica! :) I'll set it right. And I must also do laundry...*sigh* I wish I was an overage wizard and allowed to do magic at home...That would be so cool!!! And then I'd grow up to become an Auror and defeat evil wizards by chanting some really cool spells and flashing around my wand!!! The obsession isn't over yet, is it? Unlikely to ever get over anyway! I am waiting for 6th book so eagerly!!! Harry Potter is THE best fictional character (see, I accept that). Only I wish he was real! Ok ok...I'll stop!

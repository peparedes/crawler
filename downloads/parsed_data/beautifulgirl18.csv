Anyway at about 7 Nyles, Michael, and Lauren came over. My dad was bein effin crazy and was calling Lauren a child molester and said he was going to call the police when ever she touched my sister..that was hilariousssss!
 After a while Joey and Vick showed up..it was pretty cool so we wall just sat there and Nyles didnt really feel good i felt really bad for him b.c he looked really sick..:( It was my brothers birthday yesterday adn we really didnt do anything for him..oh well not my fault.

When i got home i talked to Lauren for a while and she wanted me to come over.so i met her half way and then we walked back to her house when we got to her house it was around 1, so we called Jeff and told him and Brad to go to the swim club at 2. Then i tried callin Nyles to tell him to go but he wouldnt pick up his phone so i left him a voicemail. After that we went and got in outr bikinis and stuff and Lauren's mom gave us a ride to the swim club and were chillen there for a while and thne Stephen, Michael, Luke, and Alex all came so we were tlaking to them it was pretty fun. A lil while after that Jeff and Bradley showed up so we went bii the tennis court and were just chillen and talking and having fun and then Jeff called Nyles and told him to come and he said he would be there in a little while. So we were basically just all chillen and talking and the guys were palying basketball.Then Amber and Rachel showed up and i met Rachel for the first time shes pretty awsum shes really funny i had a good time with her. Then Nyles showed up and he was being a really big jerk and wouldnt even talk to me so i went and sat by Stephen,Luke, Michael, and alex b/c they were the only people to talk to b/c everyone else was in the pool and Nyles was way over bii the food thingy and i wanted him to come over there but he said he didnt want to walk a whole 20 feet over there..i thought that was pretty effed up that he wouldnt walk 20 feet to tlak and sit by his girlfriend but i got over it after a while and went and sat by him and then he said someting about the lifeguard that really pissed me off and he was mad at me too b/c i called him a dickhead but he was really being kind of mean but i wasnt really mad at him just confused.. Well then he had to leave and we still werent talking so i went out there to talk to him while we could be alone and i told him i was sorry for calling him a dickhead...b/c i was and he gave me a hug and told me he loved me ad it was all good again so he left to go get his four wheeler and he said he would be back so i went inside and we just had some more fun. Lauren and Jeff still havent kissed yet..omfg! Then after a while Nyles came back and he wanted me to walk to Taco Bell with him, Eve, and Stefan it was pretty kool, and when we came back i got in the pool with Lauren, Amber,Nyles, Jeff,Alex,Michael,Bradley and we were jsut ahving fun and then stupid Bradley went and told Nyles that i said i wanted to see his penis LIAR so Nyles got mad and scared the shit out of em bii saying we broke up i was really pissed and sad at the same time b/c i really like this boy alot..like ALOT lol! so i was really pissed off and then Lauren's dad just showed up out of nowhere and and so i needed to see if it was really true that me and Nyles broke up so i went in the back and talked to him and he said he wasnt serious and i was really happy b/c i like love this boy, and then we started to make out it was great and then i was talking to someone..and i went back bii mah baby and we started to make out again.. and then like Lauren and I really had to leave so we got our stuff and she went to tell Jeff bye and i went back there to tell Nyles bye again which was a bad idea b/c i knew we would just start to kiss again..which is awsum b/c i love kissing that guy lol so it turns out i was rite and we made out..again and the we really ahd to leave so we said bye to everyone and left and then we got home and ate pizza and Alex called for Lauren and they talked for a while then Lauren had me call this guy Jerod or something and i talked to him pretending to be Lauren and then i was talking to him as me and he was tryin to hook up with me which is gross b/c i have a bf and he isnt the best looking guy ever..but after that he told me Adam Caro liked me and wanted to go out with him and he wanetd me to break up with Nyles to go out with Caro and i told him no b/c i love Nyles and he kept talking and talking and he said that was nonsense..i hate boys who say stupid shit like that anyway after that i called my baby on a crappy cell phone where i could hardly hear what he was saying and then something happend to the phone and he wanst there anymore so i tried calling back but that didnt work so i just gave up, and we called Jeff and talked to them and they were being all wierd and asking us to do strange things well after a whole bunch of phone and computer talking we went and got some cereal and ate and then went to bed and this morning i woke up really late b/c i was supposed to be at home at 10 and i woke up at 10 i was trying to find a ride but it wasnt really working so i had to walk all the way home..ugh its so hott and then i got home did my chores and now im online and writing in here!

So i did some more chores and then my mom brought me over there b/c it was raining. And then after i got there we got dressed and went to this recital thing and it was like alot of fun! The whole time we were looking for this boy that Lauren likes but it was worth it b/c i really wanted to meet him b/c  ya know..i have to look out for my BFFE and make sure shes not talking to ugly guys rite? but i met him and she picked a good one lol. After all that we went and sat by Jeff and Nyles and we were hanging out and talking with them for the rest of the night and then at about 9 we all left and we were still talking to Jeff and Nyles and now Brad and Adam outside, it was really fun they are AWSUM,  and then Jeff was talking to Nyles on the phone and Jeff asked me my number and i was like ""why"" and come to find out it was really Nyles who wanted my number so i gave it to him and after that we went and walked all the way from the Civic Center to Mcdonalds and i bought Lauren and me some caramel sundays ((the shit))!! and we saw Brandon Kelly there hes really kool and nice hes a good person to talk to, and then we crossed the street and went to see my baby at work and then we remebered we had to be home so me and Lauren walked home and a moth flew in her mouth ((sick)) and she was basically freaking out but everything was ok! And then after we got home we got on the computer and Lauren was tlaking to Jeff and i called Nyles and we were talking to them for 3hours and 49 minutes! JEEZ! that was like the longest phone conversation ever but thats ok cuz me and Nyles are BFFERZ! and then when it was anbout 4 am i fell asleep and me and Lauren went to bed, and then we woke up and we were supposed to go to the swim club but its like all raining and shit and still is, i hate when rain ruins people's plans. And then Laurens mom brought me home :( and i did all my chores and now i think Lauren is mad at me but idk i hope shes not b/c shes like my bestest friend EVER and i hate when shes mad :( ! and that would deff suck if she was! after all that i was talking to buddy and stuff and now im writing in here wow that was long! Well now i am going to find something esle to do, and im waiting for Nyles to get home from school, cuz hes in summer school like a loser j/m lol, which he should be since it is..4:45!!!! So L8eRrR!

We prank called Buddy or at least we werew going to but we didnt but we called him and Lauren was telling him all kinds of stuff like that i was going to do something bad and he was going to be sad whenever i did it, it was pretty funny. Lauren and Amanda are great they are so0o much fun, and then there was this guy there omg his name was...Jonathan Lamb and you could so tell he was gay but then he told us that he was bi but he seemed more gay thatn bi to me. Anyway after talking to him for a while we went and played on the play set they have over there which was fun! And then Aaron TAssin and a bunch of his friends came omg they are so0o0o0o hot! yes! And then we went swimming again and again it was really fun and then after all that it was about 6:00 so Lauren and Amanda walked me home! So i came home and did the laundry and then i called Fred ((my real dad)) and found out that i didnt need to go to Illinois! yay! thats makes me really happy b/c like i ahve all my bestest friends down here that i deff do not want to leave especially Lauren who i won't see anymore xcept for on the weekends, but at least i will see her then.

"event","Well today started off fun and now its not going so well...I had alot of fun at Lauren's house but then Buddy called. I mean i really like him alot but things kind of don't feel the same as they did when we first started going out. I remember i was all excited when he asked me out and like now its just like...Blah! well i don't know anymore all my other bf's were jerks and he's a really good bf. I don't know what im thinking. I think he loves me too much but then again i love him too.. well at least i think i do..Well i dunno i guess im just gunna have to see how things go. Im not saying i want to or im going to break up with him..im just thinking right now i guess, b/c i think of if we were actually broken up and i really get all sad and then i realize i love him alot and i shouldn't be feeling that way b/c really he is actually the best bf a girl could have and the best bf i ahve ever had, and i really do love him..these things are confusing! oh well, things will be ok i love him! Well anyway i ahd alot of fun with Lauren, Sam, and Amanda they are effin awesome! i love being around them!We went to see House of Wax which was AWSUM! it was like really freaky and scary tho! We were the only four people in the whole theatre maybe its b/c it was a tuesaday nite oh well we had fun and then we went home and we talked on the computer and did funny stuff then me and Amanda got all tired so we layed down and Lauren wasn't tired so she stayed up for a while taking pictures of herself and her little white butt L0L!! shes so dumm but i gotsta love her cuz shes the bestest friend anyone could have! I found out today im most likely going to have to go to Illinois for the whole summer which will SUCK b/c im gunna miss everyone especially my friends and Buddy..but we will see what happens.. well thats about it for my first entry..pretty dam long huh? well l8erR..I <3 BuDdY"

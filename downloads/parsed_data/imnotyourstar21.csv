"event","helloooo. so yeaaaah. lets see ummm on wednesday i had work...it was way boring. and then after work i talked to sarah and found out that nicks mom died :( so i went to her house and then we went to mcdonalds and waited till nick could get out of his house and we went and parked at loyds but he wasnt at home so we went for a walk to the school. then after a little while of being there kyle called so i decided we should go pick him up. haha. so we went and got him. then drove around for about half an hour or 45 mins to find a place where we could just sit around. then we ended up going to the developement behind my house. and walked around and shit there. then about 1 we decided we should probably drop nick and kyle off cuz we were supposed to be back at sarahs at 11 haha but her parents usually fall asleep and so we go back there whenever we want. but then a little past 1 sarahs dad calls my phone and tells sarah to come to their room when she gets home and that i cant sleep over. so we drop the boys off and i drop sarah off. then im like...well fuck i cant go home...and i cant stay here. so what do i do? i go back to the developement behind my house. park on the side of the road. and sleep in my car. haha. it was scary cuz its all trees and stormy. :( not cool. then at about 8 i woke up and got a text from sarah saying she saw my mom and i could go home...so i went home. haha. and i was gonna sleep but then i couldnt so i just took a shower and got ready and went to the place where she was babysitting and hung out with her there. then at about 1ish i left and met up with my sister and then went to work. and it was kinda sucky the first half. but then after break it got better. haha. then aftyer work i went home. like the first night i havent done anything for a long time. haha. then i talked to kyle on the phone for like 3 and a half hours. haha. so that was pretty awsome. then i went on the computer for like 10 mins. and decided i was insanely tired so i went to bed and slept till 11 when i got a call from my mom making me wake up :( not cool. haha. but yeah now im just sitting around. procrastinating doing my chores. excited to go to the garage tonight :) should be a good time. well im gonna go now. talk to you laaaater."

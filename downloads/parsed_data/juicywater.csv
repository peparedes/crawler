"event","<p><br />The past two weeks have been so busy at work and worse... it gets worse! over the next few months. Tonight I start my diploma in event management, which is great because I finally get - my brain has gone totally blank, what's the word? shit - official credititations? QUALIFICATIONS!! Bloody hell. This is what getting up at 5am does to me. Had to get up, shower, find my clothes in the dark, and then drive my boyfriend's back to my place, pack my lunch, park my car, get on the Underground, and finally get to work. Hence the rambling as I am stupid tired and... yes, my course starts tonight.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's five months of every Monday and Wednesday night, straight from work until about 10pm and getting home somewhere between 11pm and midnight. With normal work during the day, and Weight Watchers on Tuesdays. I'm going to be so tired and I am SO paranoid about not being able to stick to plan and eating McDonalds because it's the only place where I can get dinner.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I've planned out my food and yesterday cooked a roast chicken and chopped it up for food during the week. Luckily there is a microwave at work so the plan is to have a hot dinner before my course at work before I leave. It does mean eating at 5:30pm but that's okay, might get me in to more of a routine. So today's food is:<br />Breakfast - toast with strawberry jam<br />Lunch - Baked potato with tomatoes and WW cheese spread (3 pts for a tub!)<br />Dinner - Babotie (baked curried mince with an egg topping, it's a South African recipe and I really should put it online) with rice<br />Snacks - satsuma, banana and a Babybel cheese<br /><br />*yawn* so tired and it's only 8:49am. Oh ouch. </p>"

"event","<p><br />Quick answer - laptop blew up (harddrive went bye-bye) and I've also been on holiday in South Africa for three weeks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Bad news is that I am now 16 st 6.5 .... *sigh*&nbsp;<br />Good news is that I put on less that I thought considering I have not tracked or thought about my diet since Dec 23.&nbsp;<br /><br />BUT as of today I am back on the wagon. Creaking. It's harder than I thought as I'd gotten used to mooshing as much food in my face as possible going ""I'm on holiday!"" and I've gone from sunny climes to freezing cold weather that just makes me want to crawl under my duvet with a wodge of chocolate and sugary tea.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm using the online WW tracker to keep track again, and have already shocked myself by realising that the two pieces of toast I had this morning came to 6.5 points. Definitely time for some good old fashioned tracking.&nbsp;<br /><br />I really want to get back on track and not give up. I turned 30 seven days ago and well... it looks like Phil and I will be tying the knot within the next two years, if I'm not jumping the gun there but I think I'm pretty safe to assume. So I really really really want to concentrate on slimming down. I really noticed the difference in putting on the weight. I feel a lot more sluggish and thick around the middle. Not so good. So back on the diet and hopefully I can shift those pounds quite quickly and get back on track. I really do hope so.&nbsp;<br /><br />I also start evening classes in a week time for a work diploma. It's three months and I have to go straight from work to the course, and only get home at about 11pm, so I need to look into planning packed lunch and packed dinner for twice a week that will fill me up and not leave me starving and hunting out a takeaway. So I'm going to start trawling for receipes but if anyone has any please let me know. :)</p>"

"event","<p>I know I'm an emotional eater but just how much of an emotional eater has been bought home to me with a bump over the past few days. I've put on at least 5 pounds this week. Why?<br /><br />Because I'm stressed out of my tiny little mind at the moment. Work has been one big stress-fest and all I'm getting at home is people bickering and at the boyfriend's house I'm playing maid-slave. I cleaned the kitchen AGAIN for the second weekend running and I'm starting to get very tired very fast of spending my weekend's cleaning and doing what everyone else wants to do, or having to listen to how bad everyone else's life is and can they just offload on me for the next 4 hours (I was going to go have a lie down and a bath but sure I'll sit here for hours willing myself to death).&nbsp;<br /><br />So I'm stressed and frustrated which means I'm unhappy which means... I totally don't stick to plan, eat chips, gorge on butter and cheese, drink hot chocolate and basically fling myself into that chocolate river in a fit of self-induced madness.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's not pretty.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>"

They make the best falafels in London and the best part is that it's pure indulgence but freshly made, no bits added to it, it's not oily, and I can just die happy eating there.&nbsp;

So I saved 18 points for dinner tonight! I can't wait. the thought of all those lovely salads, hummous (I shall learn to spell that word one day&nbsp;I swear), olives, peppers.... *drools*&nbsp;

"event","<p><br />At last night's meeting we spoke about setting realistic goals - like saying you're not going to eat chocolate for a month is a sure fire way of disappointing yourself but saying that this week you're going to try and go without chocolate probably means you'll succeed.&nbsp;<br /><br />We went round the group and when they got to me I surprised myself and probably everyone else by saying that my unrealistic goal was reaching goal.&nbsp;<br /><br />Why? Well it's like hiking - when you can see the mountain you're heading too and it's grey and hazey in the distance you can't ever imagine getting there, but when you see the top of the hill you're on, well getting to the top of is easier and you get there, and then you get up the next hill, and the next, and next thing you know you're up that mountain and the journey wasn't as impossible as you thought it was.&nbsp;<br /><br />I really struggle seeing myself at goal. I can't imagine me looking different. I can imagine smaller tummy, or no double chin, etc, but I can't imagine a whole smaller me. It freaks me out. And also by not being able to imagine it, it's not real to me and not a real goal to aim for. So I'm not focusing on the big picture but on the smaller pictures. I'm making my weight loss a mosaic, rather than a large oil painting.&nbsp;<br /><br />So...<br /><br />MEDIUM GOAL -&nbsp;to have lost 25 pounds in total by Christmas Eve, which is 6 pounds. If I do more, and I really really hope I do, then that will be me Christmas present to myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />LITTLE GOAL #1 - to stay on track this week and to realise that the weight loss this week is in part due to being ill, and it's not a bad thing if I put on a little weight next meeting. My goal though is to make sure it's not too much back on, so tracking it is.&nbsp;<br /><br />LITTLE GOAL #2 - to go to the gym on Thursday for a good treadmill walk and Friday afternoon to do my circuit training</p>"

"event","Today I actually told a colleague off for being disparinging about me losing weight. I commented on the fact that last Xmas I put on 9 pounds in 3 days and I was determined not to gain this Christmas by planning ahead. He said ""that's what you think.""&nbsp;

So I said ""It's not helpful to me when you make comments like that, I am planning ahead and will succeed. If you don't have anything positive to say I would prefer it that you not say anything to me at all.""

He shut up and changed the subject.&nbsp;

But it got me thinking on how many times that does actually happen? You say ""oh I'm really doing well and going to succeed at this"" and then someone feels the need to come along and piss on your parade? It's a hell of a lot more than you think and it just seriously annoys me.&nbsp;

I'll add more to this later but I'm at work and got to go to a meeting."

I'm trying to see the bright side, that I've lost weight in time for tonight's meeting but I still feel rough and rather under the weather.&nbsp;<br /><br />Basically there's a lovely winter virus doing the rounds at the moment which is the sudden onslaught of vomting, to the point of not even water being kept down. I haven't felt as rough since university and all night drinking sessions. Not pleasant at all and means any thought of food or dieting has gone straight out the window. I can't even handle the thought of soup at the moment, it's like *shudder* no thanks. Hopefully tonight I'll feel more my normal self. I haven't been sick since Monday morning, but I do feel like I've been smacked in the back and stomache with a stick - rather sore.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyone else been struck with the lurgy?</p>"

This weekend I spent reorganising my entire room, which meant I was eating on the run and when I was hungry and not tracking. I made a loaf of wholewheat bread on Friday night and basically lived on marmite sandwiches over the weekend. I splurged on a pizza on Friday night (though limited the cheese) and Monday night went out for dinner which was really hard as basically everything on the menu was cooked in butter and drizzled in oil. BUT I did go to the gym twice and was running around a lot, so the exercise balanced out the unrestrained eating. I definitely need to track to lose weight, but the really nice thing was that at my meeting last night a few of my friends commented on the fact that I was looking so much slimmer so I was yay!

"event","Been reading Paul McKenna's book - I can make you thin. Now I'm not usually into the self-help type books but it's a small book and I thought, what the hell. His rules though really stuck in my mind, particularly for someone like me who can just eat and eat and eat without any thought, and can also then not eat for an entire day because I don't feel like it.&nbsp;

In the book he said something that really stuck in my mind. Most over-weight people think about food a lot. They fantasize about it, plan what they're going to eat. And yet... very few actually enjoy or remember what they just ate.&nbsp;It really struck a chord because I know there have been times when it's not what I'm eating but the physical act of eating that's been key. I know I ate the pie, I just don't really remember&nbsp;eating the pie. The flavours, the textures, savouring it. I inhaled it and my tummy was stuffed and I wanted another one.&nbsp;

1. When hungry - EAT
2. Eat what you want to eat, don't force yourself to eat
3. ENJOY your food. Don't watch telly or read, concentrate on what you are eating (aka realise you're eating, not woolfing it down)
4. When you begin to feel full, STOP.&nbsp;

The difference between emotional hunger and real hunger is almost impossible to tell. But emotional hunger is swift and sudden, real hunger builds slowly. I definitely&nbsp;need to&nbsp;work on the emotional eating.&nbsp;

Reasons why I emotional eat:
- boredom
- upset
- tired
- avoidance (why clean when I can eat biscuits)

One of the weirder things I have noticed about myself is that I panic when food is taken away from me. Ok that sounds really weird. Let me explain - I become anxious in the following situations:
1. There is food left over and it's going to be thrown away. I feel I must eat it rather than waste. I have been known to literally force food into my mouth to avoid it being thrown away. 
2. Someone gets more on their plate than me.&nbsp;
Basically food deprivation makes me really anxious. Logically I know that there is food, but emotionally I'm ""oh my god! I'm going to starve!"". Also, thinking about it, I've equated food with satisfaction and calm for so long, that i see food being thrown away as almost like part of my happy is being thrown away. I know, I know. I'm writing this and thinking the same - this chick is nuts. But here's the thing. I'm not. Ask any truly overweight person how they feel about food and the honest truth is that it's a love affair - with it's up and downs, dirty secrets, cheating, tears, laughter, smiles, more tears.&nbsp;

So my task for the next two weeks is:
- eat when I am hungry, stop when I am full
- leave something on my plate every single meal, even if it's a pea or a carrot. No clean plates
- Any time I start to panic about food I&nbsp;ask repeat to myself&nbsp; ""why is it important? Why am I anxious? Food to live, not live for food"""

So I'm all for the size 18 pair. They're identical. Only the size 20 is drooping rather unattractively in the front, rear and sides and the size 18 is squeezing rather unattractively in the front, rear and sides. It's either camel toe or droopy bags.&nbsp;I went for droopy bags. <br /></p>"

I need to track and I need to eat, so hopefully this will merge the two nicely.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recipes I'm going to try:<br />- North African spiced lamb mince with sweet potatoes<br />- Piperade (egg, tomato and sweet pepper bake)<br />- Butternut squash, red pepper and soft cheese soup<br />- Low-fat chicken fajitas (tonight)<br />- Lemon &amp; courgette pasta<br />- Stuffed peppers, using the leftover spiced lamb mince<br />- Lamp chop with baked potato<br />- Sausage and tomato pasta<br />- Baked breakfast tomato<br />- Chicken &amp; bacon roll made with sliced chicken breast, fromage frais and bacon bits<br /><br />If you want any of the receipes now, just say so, though I'm going to post them after I've made them to see if they're any good. Also photos - cause again, nerd. <br /></p>"

"event","So I lost the plot this past week. After the teeth came out, I got a cold, and then I could eat, and I was sick, and hungry, and well... beligerent so I ate what I wanted. Which mean when I got on the scales at the meeting while I'd still lost weight, I knew that I'd lost a heck of a lot more and put about 4 pounds back on. 

I've lost my focus a bit. I caught myself last night with the classic ""well it's Wednesday so I have the rest of the week to diet before my meeting"". Gah!!!! No! No! No!

*smacks self on hand*

I'm going shopping tonight and instead of my usual throwing in of what I fancy at the time without any real thought to what I'm actually going to cook the coming week, I'm sitting going through the recipes online to get some ideas and actually plotting out the next two weeks. I think it's time for some forcing myself back into the pattern I'd established before my teeth came out that meant I was eating in my points without really focusing on it. I worked out that I went 16 points over the past two days because I wasn't tracking. Ouch. So damage control is needed. Specially since I worked out that if I hadn't thrown my control to the wind I'd be averaging a 1lb a week, at the moment I've lost 5.5lbs in 8 weeks. Mmm... yes definitely need to move my butt a bit, specially since I'm going to South Africa end of Decemeber and will be in a swimming costume (*hides face in hands*)

Boy though it's hard working out 2 weeks worth of meals. I'm not being specific about days, I'm not that anal, but just thinking of stuff I can eat, that I know the points, I'm like - d'uh. 

But some nice recipes so maybe I'll have a few to add to the recipe book."

"event","Last night I was tired. So I messed up my dinner. Badly. 

For some bizarre reasons I decided to put on top of potato gnocchi a weird mess that I knew was going to taste vile but I'd started it so...
basically I cooked in a pan one large sliced up mushroom, sliced ham, plain yoghurt, plain cream cheese, french mustard and herbs. 

It. Was. Vile. 

Seriously, no more experiments of that kind. I forced myself to eat it (I cooked it, I'm bloody well eating it) but Lord. It was gloompy, over-powering and tart as hell. 

I'm sticking to recipes for a while."

"event","I have made my boyfriend fat. I swear. 

March 2005 - I weighed 16 1/2 stone. He weighed 12 st 12. 

Now? - I weigh 16 stone (give or take), he weighs 15 st 12. 

We don't live together. I'm always on a diet. How did he get fat?!?

The theory is it's because he's comfortable cause I'm there and he doesn't have to look good to get chicks anymore. Admittedly at 12 st 12 he looked skinny and I prefer him with some meat on his bones, but I looked yesterday and he is definitely looking chubby. He's getting his Dad's beer belly. Which is a worry cause his Dad looks like Santa. Noooooo!! 

So I've challenged to beat him to 15 stone. And yes I totally forgot men lose weight at like 5 pounds a week. But I'm still going to beat him."

"event","So I recently came back from a trip to LA. I would have posted earlier but I got home at 9pm on the Tuesday night and was at work at 8am on Wednesday morning. I also had to work this weekend so combined with jet lag you can just imagine. I'm not 100% back on a normal schedule yet, but getting there.&nbsp;

I'm really pleased that I lose weight while I was away. I decided not to track when I got there as it just proved a little too much to try and maintain. Instead I decided to just keep an eye on what I ate and make healthy choices, and to be honest be a little strict with myself.&nbsp;

I decided before I got there that I would not deprive myself, but would only eat burger, fries and pizza once, and only if we actually were somewhere where that was pretty much all the offered. So I did have all those things, but only once&nbsp;- when we went to a diner, so I had a burger, and when we went to a great little pizza parlour in Santa&nbsp;Monica, where I had a salad and a slice of pizza.&nbsp;

I mostly had salads and avoided cheese on things. Also - NO junk food snacks. Didn't buy crisps/chips at all. I did have some at a party we went too, but I'd had 4 tequlia shots by then so can happily forgive myself!

I think the worst part was actually coming back to the UK and being swamped by work. I sort of feel that I allowed too much free reigh coming home in terms of food and have had takeaways twice, and been eating sandwiches from the canteen. So weigh-in was last night, and as of today I am firmly back on tracking. Not very well as I had a business lunch, but tonight I'm having a nice salad to balance that out. Also shopping tonight to get back in line with correct food in the fridge and planning dinner tomorrow night for me and my boyfriend Phil.&nbsp;

So yeah, it was pretty good and I'm quite chuffed with myself!"

<br />Which means that I'm going to have to behave on my US trip and carry a little diary with me to track. And also take my points calculator (which is still in the box).<br /><br />We shall see at weigh-in tonight. I don't want to go. LOL"

"event","<p><strong>One : counting and gaining</strong><br /><br />I've been tracking, keeping in the points. So how come I'm putting on weight and it's not TOM? Last night I weight myself. 16st 10. TEN?!?!! Excuse my language but wtf?&nbsp;<br />Boyf did point out, bless him, that I'd eaten earlier - my acid reply doesn't bear repeating.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oooh this is so annoying. I'll give it two more weeks and then I'm dropping 1pt down.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Two: watching chubby people go by....<br /></strong><br />Ok this is going to sound a little weird and a bit bitchy, but it's not. Have you ever sat and just watched fat people?&nbsp;I did it today.&nbsp;<br /><br />I never think about how I must look to other people, and to be honest being body conscious makes you either not see other people, or only concentrate on the ones you think are perfect (and wish would just sod off). Today I decided I was going to sit and look at how people move when they are overweight - a motivator for myself. It's quite an eye opener. The gazelle that I think I am, I am not.&nbsp;<br /><br />Things I noticed:<br />- butt cheek ride, trousers, shorts getting lost in the backside<br />- middle thigh rid-up, when your clothes try and head north<br />- the waddle; it's unavoidable but when your thighs not only touch but press together, you waddle side to side<br />- double chins and boobs move on their own<br />- protective usage of handbags, jumpers round the waist, to hide any lumps and bumps<br /><br />I don't know how I look to other people when moving. I can look at a photo and go, yes I look overweight. But I don't know what the live version of me looks like. Watching other people has definitely made that ""I don't want to look like that"" impact on me. I'll be brutally honest, I am not someone who subscribes to the ""fat is beautifull"". I don't think that the person is ugly, but I do think that being overweight is detrimental to people's happiness and health. I don't think only size 6's are beautiful, far from it, but I would rather be a size 16 and look good and feel healthy, then be a size 22 and pretend that I feel comfortable in my own skin because it's 'just the way I am' when in actual fact I feel like crap.&nbsp;<br /><br />Just my thoughts for the day. </p>

Obviously going 21 points over in a week is really really really bad as I weighed in at 16st 9lbs, which means an increase of 2.8 lbs since Wednesday. So mmm... I guess my question of how bad is it going over your points is answered, about 1/10th of a pound per point, 10 points over a week means a pound over.&nbsp;<br /><br />I could be totally making that up but I just really feel miffed right now. Spoke to boyfriend and he said not to worry too much about it cause it was an unusual weekend, I knew it, and I drank which I normally don't do and no exercise. So Wed we're going to go for a 2hour walk to get the blood pumping again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Argh! Well I had soup for dinner and that was only a point. I think I will need to make an extra effort to stay inside my points, in fact I should stay a few points below this week as I have the wedding on Saturday and that's lunch plus evening buffet reception.

The dress is absolutely amazingly flattering. It's sleeveless with a V neckline, a and kinda cinches in just below the boobs. Straight fall down of material which ends in points, so it swirls out when I swirl. I'm going to try and get a picture of it with me in it. The blue high heels are not something I would normally go for, ever, but I had a strange ""want, must have"" moment with them. I then spent 3 hours trying to find anything that matched the blue to accesorize with. Black little bag and a bright blue shawl, blue beaded jewellery with a little bit of silver. Being pale and blonde does sometimes pay off!&nbsp;<br /><br />here's are the shoes<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.oasis-stores.com/pws/images/catalogue/products/68300012/large/68300012.jpg"" /><br />Now the bad news. I totally lost the plot food wise this weekend. I was going so well up until the first rum and coke on Sat night. Alcohol, food and me do not mix. Points schmoints! EAT! FOOD! *bangs head on desk*&nbsp;<br />Sat night dinner - lasagne at boyfriend's mom's house. Ate more than I should have AND ate the chocolate mousse dessert.<br />Sun night - BBQ, which suprisingly I stayed in points for, until I'd had two glasses of wine then had three biscuits with cheese on.&nbsp;<br />I've been tracking online and overall over the past week I have eaten a grand total of 21.5 points more than I should have. That's nearly a full day. The weekend was the main culprit, but mid-week I ate 1/2 a pizza cause there was nothing else but soup and I wanted the pizza more than my willpower could push me to the soup.&nbsp;<br /><br />So. Things learnt this week<br />- alcohol stops me counting points and I lose valuable ground because I throw away a lot of hard work<br />- social/party eating is a problem with nibbles. I eat more than I should as I graze over the evening<br />- I need more routine and less eating away from home. I can't control my food as well when I'm not planning meals in advance<br />- more exercise required<br />"

I live with two other woman, I'm the youngest at 29 (30 in a few months) and sometimes the tension is a little fraught.

I used to be a boredom snacker but free time is now so precious that I am rarely bored.&nbsp;<br />But...<br />Work boredom - ah, cookies come out.&nbsp;<br /><br /><u>Too busy</u><br />If I am really busy two things happen. I either forget to eat, or a just shove the nearest food to hand in my mouth. I need to be really careful and planning helps.&nbsp;<br /><br /><u>Agitated/Stressed</u><br />Ties in with tiredness. I have a bit of a bizarre relationship with food in that if you deprive me, take it away, I can become quite agitated. I&nbsp;think it stems from the time I lived with my grandparents, where you had to clear your plate by the time dinner was finished. In other words dinner had a timetable that was stuck to and I remember frantically cramming food in so that my plate was clear on time. Sounds bizarre but grandparents can have rather strange views on things, specially since my mom swears she wasn't raised that way, I can only put it down to old age and forgetting what kids are like.&nbsp;<br />I digressed there, but basically I can become quite agitated about food, and if I am agitated about something else going on that can be carried over to food. It's difficult to explain but the outcome is predictable - I cram food in, or knowingly eat bad food cause it's bad and&nbsp; I don't care."

"event","<p>Got back from Devon last night, had a wonderful time, but rather self-indulgent. I must confess that I didn't stick to my points, but I was aware of what I was eating so tailored it down while still enjoying.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Points details for Friday 11 Aug - Wed 16 Aug</strong></p>
<p><u>Friday - 31pts</u> : Burritos for dinner, went a bit nutty on the cheese<br /><u>Saturday - 23pts</u> : good day, paid attention<br /><u>Sunday - 23pts</u> : another good day, paid attention<br /><u>Monday - 39pts</u> : &nbsp;too heavy on the points (sausage sandwich for breakfast, and a proper Cornish pasty for lunch) BUT carried over 4 pts from previous 2 days, so dropped to 35pts, and I&nbsp;did 4 hours strenous hiking (1000ft climb in 1km up a cliff) with a whopping 13 bonus pts (and I know only supposed to use 4, but heck, I worked my butt off uphill), so I figured the points cancelled themselves out. <br /><u>Tuesday - 22.5pts</u> : very suprising that I stayed in points as we went out for a lovely dinner. I did order the ostrich steak (gorgeous!) which is only 3pts and a baked potato. Used most of my points on 2 glasses of wine and a martini. <br /><u>Wednesday - 37pts</u> : very poor as unnecessary. Had 1/2 a Goodfellas pizza for dinner and woofed down some dry roasted peanuts at 5.5pts (ack!)<br /><br />One good thing is that I took this week as a holiday from my meetings, so the next one is only next Tuesday. I'm going to concentrate on my points until then to negate any weight on from the Devon holiday. Hopefully it won't be too much as I paid attention for the first time ever and probably would have eaten four times that amount if I wasn't tracking.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another really good thing was that I told everyone right at the start that I was tracking and everyone was totally cool and helpful about it. No hassling to eat more, and in fact when I pointed out that a Cornish pasty is anything between 12 and 16 points, there was a momentary oooooh! We all still ate them though as we then climbed up a 1000ft from Lynmouth to the top on the nearest hill.&nbsp;<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.devon-online.com/towns/lyntonandlynmouth/images/beach.jpg"" />&nbsp;Walked from the bottom right, up to the top above on those hills (about the middle) overlooking the sea. </p>"

"event","<br />I'm on 25 points and for breakfast, lunch and snacks I used up 10.5 pts. So with 14.5pts left for dinner&nbsp;I decided I could up the stakes on the Italian Veg recipe (below) so....<br /><br />I should just point out first that is <u>ridiculously </u>high in points but I halved it so I could have the rest for lunch tomorrow. I wouldn't recommend it if you're not watching the points exactly. It was totally yummy but I am feeling a little guilty at the over-indulging despite staying with my points. Never mind, here goes:<br /><br /><strong>OTT Italian Bake</strong><br />Points for recipe 18.5pts<br />Portions 2<br />Points per portion 9.5pts<br /><br />Layered up in a small casseole dish and baked in the over for an hour or so.<br />&nbsp;1/2 pot Yeo Valley Organic Healthy Creme Fraiche 5pts<br />&nbsp;1/2 medium goat cheese 2pts<br />&nbsp;1 small portion mushrooms 0pt<br />&nbsp;1 serving Tesco Healthy Living Mozzarella Cheese 1.5pts<br />&nbsp;2 portion aubergine 0pt<br />&nbsp;20 portion olives, in brine 1pt<br />&nbsp;2 medium por pesto sauce 6.5pts <br />&nbsp;3 large tomato(s) 0pt<br />&nbsp;Served with cooked couscous 2.5pts<br /><br />To be honest I don't think I'd used the creme fraiche again as while it tasted great it did look a bit ick as it separated. The goats cheese I crumbled throughout and it gave it a lovely little something extra.&nbsp;Also indulged that cheese craving tooth I have.<br />I put it on couscous as it created a heck of a lot of juice and I also didn't want to eat the whole pot of veg and cheese, so I put the extra sauce/juice all over the couscous.&nbsp;The olives were a great addition, if you've never tried it and love olives, I would really recommend trying it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img104.imageshack.us/img104/3533/10aug019ak0.jpg"" /><br /><br />

"event","<br />The first time round that I did WW my leader and I didn't get on. That's not to say there was animosity - far from it - it's just that I didn't feel inspired and I never felt that she was particularly interested in how people were doing. Meetings consisted of everyone sitting in rows listening to what she said, minimum feedback other than ""everyone put their hands up who lost a pound this week. Right. Who lost two?"". Painful. I spent, and I'm embaressed to say this, a year bouncing backwards and forwards in the same stone. On, off, same, on, off, same. Yo-yo'ing away.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've sinced moved to London and found a group that suits me completely. My leader, Laura, is bubbly, fit and enthusiastic. She does nine meetings a week and knows everyone who attends her meetings by name. Miss a week and you get a little poem in the mail saying ""missed you"". Meetings consist of all of us sitting in a circle and talking to each other, in fact someone commented this week that it's like therapy. Everyone's comments are welcomed and saying you've had a bad week is met with sympathy and helpful suggestions.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lord it sounds idealic doesn't it?? LOL. Seriously though it's one of the best things in my week. The problem for me is keeping it going during the week. I have a highly focused job, which means when I get home I tend to revert to being a teenager. Junk food eaten on the sofa watching telly.&nbsp;<br /><br />This week we discussed making time for yourself. In small groups we talked about things we could do daily, weekly and monthly just for ourselves. I had an interesting realisation during our talk - <strong>the only form of self-indulgence most of us&nbsp;allow ourselves is food</strong>, anything else is wrapped in a guilt of we should be doing something else, like the washing, cleaning, sorting our finances. I reward myself with food when I am feeling stressed because I am unable to find other ways of taking care of myself to let myself relax. This is definitely something I need to work on.&nbsp;<br /><br /><u>Daily</u><br />- doing Soduko on the Tube<br />- having 10 minutes in the morning to just sit and have a cup of tea<br />- get a bit of the cleaning done so it doesn't pile up and bug me while trying to relax<br />- keep track of my food so its one less thing to feel stressed about<br /><u>Weekly</u><br />- attend my meetings<br />- get some exercise in a few days a week;&nbsp;gym, walking, stairs<br />- one night a week have a bubble bath<br /><u>Monthly<br /></u>- have a beauty pampering day<br />- spend a day walking in a park or day hike"

"event","I've been thinking about the purpose of this LJ. I created it with the intent of making it just about me and my weight, but I do realise that may be incredibley boring to not only myself but anyone who comes and reads it (if anyone other than my boyfriend, hi honey!). Thing is though, I do have another LJ where I rant and scream at the world and I am loathe to mix the two. Juicyfruit is me just being me, nothing added. And I think I like it that way. So I'm going to stick to this format for a while and see how it goes. But I can talk about food a lot :) 

Edit - just been watching the news about the closing of airports etc due to terror alerts. *sigh* I'm off to US at the beginning of Sep and fly back on, wait for it... 11 Sep. Oh yes. I couldn't have picked it better. My main worry is not the 10 hours of getting through security, but whether or not I'll fit into the&nbsp;airplane seat&nbsp;on the way back after spending 10 days eating out in the US. The last time I was there I ordered a burger at Friday's that when it arrived it&nbsp; was bigger than my head and the pickle on the side was longer than my arm. And the sad thing? I really could've eaten the whole thing. I didn't cause even then, when I was happily piling on the weight, I knew that eating 1/2 a cow wasn't the best idea in the world.&nbsp; 

Oh god. Oreo cookie milkshakes. *staples mouth shut*"

Gemma is a sweety pie. But I feel like I've just joined a wives club for girls dating members of Flat Club (a small devision of Pants-off Time members). She sat me down the other day and gave me all sorts of advive on how to make the best of situations. Rule one was to invite yourself along to things rather than wait for them to remember you. Either they just assume you'll turn up or they don't think to invite you but will be really happy if you come anyway. I tested this theory last monday and she was proved right so I'm well on the way to getting over my stubborness on only going places when expected. Yay for maturing!

Also on the note of maturing, Lauren needs to grow the fuck up. I'm past the fact she tried to get me convicted (maybe not past it but solving the problem) and am now notising just what a child she is. We had a flat meeting and nothing came out of it. While Dean amd myself could own up and take responsibility for our shortcomings, she had an excuse for everything. What ever happened to just admitting fault, apologizing and moving on?

So after that I decided to say screw it to my savings and I'll find another flat ASAP even if I end up paying for two rooms. I can afford it if I'm careful."

I'm jaded so excuse lack of sense.

Anyway I picked a really great time to be signed up to a first aid course through work... As in I'm basically working 6 days a week while Tash is here. May try to get a day off next week and take them out to see the castle. Because I feel like the only thing I've done so far is cook them food (Tash doesn't cook, I don't think Ruth wants to) and get drunk with them. I want wholesome fun! 

Hehehehehe! It's fucking insane but I think Thom is mildly idolizing Tash and that she's enjoying it far too much. Egotistical bitch, I hope you're reading this! It's really cute though. I'm glad they clicked so well.

Lastly I'm going to be trying to fill my room and go live elsewhere at mid semester because Lauren  is retardedly physco. She told everyone that she laid an assault charge against me and didn't come home for two days because she didn't want to be there when the police arrived. I haven't even been contacted by any officers so either she's an utter bull shitter or they did what most other people have done when hearing this and laughed their pants off. I really didn't think her attention seeking could hit such heights. Yes I bruised her when I bit her but as I remember it I bit her twice. First softly but she didn't stop trying to irritate me so I bit her again harder. She knows that I'll bite when she annoys me too much yet still tries it on. Take some fucking responsibility for you own actions and accept consequences. She's trying to be all sweet and extra nice to me now. Grr!"

Thom and I make the worst couple. We're both so busy or having ""must not be clingy!"" issues that even though he lives three minutes away, we only see eachother a couple of times a week for more than five minutes. Damn it! We're supposed to ignore eachother months down the line not when we're in the supposed honey moon period. HAAHAHAAHHAH Fuck I kill myself. I'm actually really happy to have a part time boyfriend. I've got too much to think about. He's still very pretty though and is bouncier than a puppy on speed.

Smelly (Garry) pissed me off already. He told his new fuck buddy that I threatened him with getting a restraining order if he didn't give me space. Of course he didn't put it in those words and now the stupid kid wont talk to me because she thinks I'm phyco. Your new penis is a manipulative, condesending asshole! But then honey you'll find that out when you realize with what little is left of your brain that he controls your every move through guilt trips and his stupid dad voice... Aheam, calming down now.

Holy fuck I love pay day! I ended up getting some surprise bills last minute so instead of scraping through I spent three days with 90c in my account and $8 in my wallet. That was fun! Eeeeee! First time ever of earning nearly a grand in a fourtnight. Work is good by the way. Slightly confused though when I feel like I'm training one of last years night staff. She ain't too bright."

I'm stressing myself out again and turning small insignificant stuff into big paranoia. I just have this nagging thought about how I attract all this attention from guys when all they know is the small amount I show of myself, that little bit that creeps through the shyness and slight dislike of others in general. Every time I show interest back or relax a bit suddenly everything dissapears and I'm left looking like a clingy stupid girl. I'm sick of feeling like a stupid kid. Even though I keep telling everyone how much I love that I finally feel like I'm enjoying acting my age for once I'm really not. I hate 20 and unders. You all suck.

But then when I'm heading downhill really fast and I have the sudden brilliant idea to call an old friend, everything suddenly seems to ease off. I can take a step back a see that I just had a really busy day where over 7000 (probably closer to 8000) people walked through the door at my work, that Thom was just giving me space to get on with work as well as having his own stuff to do. Also I spent all weekend turning people down for social stuff so of course I'm going to drop down the list of people to contact for heading in to town.

My only real problem is getting Thom a birthday pressent. Why the fuck did I start a relationship with someone a week and a half before their 20th birthday?? Jewellery is a no go with him because the only thing he wears is half a friendship necklace that's pretty much a choaker seeing as it was made for 12 year old girls. There is a shirt I have to go check out tomorrow (it's dark gray with vertical pin stripes and print over the shoulder blades) and I'm trying to paint a picture. The only thing that boy is in to is music and acting >_< Grrrrrr!"

Considering all the clothing and shoes he buys for my brother just because he's always broke from buying $3000 turn tables and a $3500 computer, $200 for work clothing ain't that much to ask grrr.

Anyway work is going so awesomely, my only complaint is that I've been a bit bored from lack of things to do but that all ended this week anyway. But you know you've hit gold when your supervisor says something like... ""Don't worry if you stay reading your comic, I wont tell Ross. I can find you things to do but if you don't ask I wont hold it against you, you've worked so hard already this week."" O.o I spent an hour and a half reading comics and doing small jobs every ten minutes or so.

It's not the same weight as I used to like but half price due to the cover and front pages being dented. Sweet! I'm drawing Thom as a super ninja for his birthday next week. I'm seriously considering getting him some decent hair product too so he stops putting crusty shit in it. God damn he's pretty. Hahaha! Bastard saw my pay slip and called me his sugar momma. NO! Maybe a little. I can save $300 a fortnight and still get about what I used to at pet planet. I can't spend it all on my own!

Didn't need to spend $114 on make up just because revlon was having a sale... But I did get at least $250 of stuff and it will last me all year.
Didn't need to spend $94 on two bags of cat food because Lauren forgot her wallet and before she could pay me back spent all her money on useless stuff. Who needs so many changes of bedding???

I'd have been fine if three rent payments didn't need to come out of one pay. Oh and there was the whole moving truck thing... But yay for well off parents who wont rub it in my face that I need to borrow money again three weeks after paying off the last lot.

The thing that annoys me most is realizing my financial state just before new years and the guilt being too much to spend heaps on drinks. 

Hey but the new flat is lovely! It kinda feels more like a normal house than a student flat, it's refreshing. I went bush whacking with Garry's machete the other day, found a shed, a fish pond (complete with lilies but no fish yet) and a brick barbecue thingy that just needs a plate. My room is bigger than I remember from the inspection but my stuff is filling it no sweat. There's the prettiest little green and pink fire place and a ridiculously deep wardrobe. Sea Gull was a dumb ass again and hid under the house for a night.

Other things going on. Counting down the days until I start my new job. Got adopted by a neglected kitten, wormed and vaccinated her, called it Ripley and am now fattening her up all ready for a new home. My friend and now flat mate is driving me nuts. Still glad I'm living with her but can't wait until her boyfriend is back and she can go invade his space all the time. SO NEEDY!"

"event","Dear Silly Little Girl,

You really do seem to be quite unaware that you're making a very sensitive matter so much more angry and difficult with your behavior and it's starting to fuck me off something chronic. I can accept that no one involved really knows exactly how to handle the situation but I find it hard to believe that anyone could really be that naive. You've gone through two polar opposites in your attitude towards me in the last month and I'm sorry but I find either one just as teeth grindingly frustrating. It makes me reconsider if perhaps I was lying when I said my comment of ""don't let me drink too much or I might just rip the kids face off"" was just a joke. For you to have thrown yourself at my ex from the moment we separated until you finally got him drunk enough to sleep with you was a bit harsh but then we weren't exactly bosom buddies. But in the week to follow when I wasn't fully aware of the situation, you showed utter disrespect and childishness by fully ignoring me even when we were alone in a room and I tried to talk to you. It made me think you were only ever friendly to me in order to spend more time with my then boyfriend and I wasn't exactly quiet about my theories of your two faced personality. Word got back to you I'm guessing because you suddenly flourished with friendliness again. Good girl, you can take criticism on bored and I respect the effort you made. It made things for a time ok and I think everyone relaxed. On to the next issue. I have a pet peeve of people who can't make an effort to get out there at a party and at least make small talk rather than picking the (not occupied) person they know best and CLINGING. But this is ok, I don't mind giving someone a little help because people have done it for me and it's not a huge issue to nurture someones confidence as they're introduced to new life experiences. However it does become an issue if after a night of sitting beside me, following me everywhere, asking me to introduce you to people, saying ""I'll do it if Briar does."" and begging me not to leave when early that you fucking go have sex with my resent ex. Although you are a silly girl and probably don't realize that he still tells me everything so I can grit my teeth at this. But for fucks sake, how can you think it's ok to do your little clinging act for the night then try it on with my ex while we're in the same bloody tent! Thank goodness someone had respect enough to stop you and move away because as ready as I was to leave and sleep under the trees by the beach.. Apparently there were already other party goers having some fun there.
So let's recap on what I think of you. You are: Immature, disrespectful, two faced, conniving, you use people, naive, insensitive, childish and clingy. But karma is a bitch honey and he's using you right back. So deep throat him all you like kid but he likes his woman a little more mature. 
From now on I will be polite and even friendly but don't expect me to baby you or be your drinking buddy. I have however told the ex that he shouldn't use you because he's a better person than that and no one deserves to have their heart strings pulled in such a way.

Yours sincerely,
I Bite"

I'm currently in the stage of questioning everything, wondering retarded things like if it was the right person wrong time. No. I'm just really missing the company of the person I told over and over again that they were my best friend. Everyone keeps telling me that I'm handling things so well and have such a good approach to dealing with it. I think that's just because I'm -not- dealing with it. But now that ReFuel is close for exams and holidays and I can't just go out for a pint or four when things start to get tough. So it's time to suck it up and grow some figurative balls.

The hardest bit is knowing how much he's hurting or mad or something that I put him through it all again. He asked why I dragged  him through the last six months (since we last split) and I told him it wasn't the right time back then. I don't even understand that myself for goodness sake. He can't see that I did this for him as much as myself. He's a pain in the butt and will drive anyone crazy but the man has a heart of gold and deserves someone a little more mature than me that can love him back with everything they've got.

Switch got all sad and poopy (possibly I brought a virus home from the pups on my clothing - sorry Switch) but is almost back to his usual idiot self.

Garry was coming to meet me for lunch today just as we do most days. Instead I ended up standing with him as the vet poked and prodded a very limp and disorientated Mouse the guinea pig. Gidget just called to tell me he died. Rabbit's going to be all alone."

"event","A few weeks ago I thought I was developing a crush on a certain flatmate. He's sweet and possitive... and umm nice? Anyway a friend I talked to said it sounded like attraction due to constant close proximity and the fact that I wasn't very happy with Garry at that point. I can thankfully say she was right after a small comment made me wake up to who he is and stop glossing over everything in my mind.

He can't cook to save himself (and for a long distance runner he should be taking much better care of himself), he has no idea what he's doing with his life despite the fact he's currently restudying, he can't deal with unpleasant situations and stood in the doorway and watched Laura and myself clean for over an hour (Laura doesn't even live here anymore!). He's 27 for goodness sake, get a grip.

I got set off by the fact he wanted nothing to do with Switch (he adores this cat) because he's really sick and a bit smelly. I joked that Switch will think he doesn't love him and he replied that it was mummy's job to love him when he's sick. Grrr

Ok horrible bitchiness over. Switch is getting better, got a pay rise, had an awesome weekend and now I'm going to go eat cheese."

The landlord has shot himself in the foot really. We made a list of stuff for him to fix before we signed the new lease two months ago. There are still multiple lights that don't work, my door still can't stay closed (hippy busted her way through when she locked herself out) and the lease has a bunch of crap on there that doesn't exist because it's not up to date.

No one has signed anything... But there's Jez to think about. He likes living here and has bond tied up in the place."

I stayed away half of last night despite extreme night after (and still hungover) exhuastion. Feeling it now. It could have been over tiredness or that cheesy Tracy Chapman song I used to listen to ages ago, going through my head. I don't remember what it was called but it's about a woman who's heart is breaking because her lover can't find words enough to tell her he loves her or he's sorry but well... he can ask for a quickie to but it crudely.

One of my favorite people told me once that in a relationship someone always cares about the other more. I'd rather feel the guilt of being the one lacking again thanks.

I'm too young to give up on the idea of being loved but I also know enough of what else is out  there to not give up on him.

But it really hurts to have someone you've been with for about eight months totally ignore you telling them you love them. He hasn't said it since he took me back -three- months ago. Things have been getting really good lately... Am I expecting too much?"

"event","This weekend I learned all about how you can drink twice as much when eating and feel twice as bad the next morning.

I organized a day off work so I could go be pampered by my mum for a night. I made her fancy desserts to say thank you. My old bed is so much nicer and snugglier. Old cat doesn't pur as well as Sea Gull. He's a sweetheart.

Got back to  the city late and ended up at a bbq to celebrate Souther Lights and Sounds 1st birthday. Why? Garry and Tris do a lot of work for them and also there was a lot of free beer. Speights isn't as aweful as I remembered.
Later in the night Garry took me to some new bars to hang out with ""the guys"" (his male friends that he spent $600 with over four nights of drinking) I had the lovely exprience of being introduced to Garry's nearly fling from when we were broken up. Rea was rather nice actually, I just wish he'd explained who she was when I wasn't drunk enough to get insecure and paranoid.

So had the best hungover day ever! No kidding. Garry, half his cast, Tris (tech assistant) and myself (there to laugh at them) hiked our way deep into north east valley and up hills to find cows. Garry was highly dissapointed that they were brown. Filmed them for a bit then film four guys kneeling in a field, eating grass and mooing. It became all too much when they started mooing in harmony. Cow corus anyone?  There was also filming on baldwin street and in a playground where Tom headbutted one of those colourful animals on springs. I think he forgot he was a cow and not a bull but it made a haleriously hollow thunk."

New flat mates! The fact I find this so very very exciting is a little sad and a sure sign that I'm just not as tolerant as I thought. Switch the kitten got moved in last night. I've yet to meet him but apparently Sea Gull is being more than a bit mean. 

I'm giving this week to let myself finish going through all my junk and getting it packed away before I -have- to start looking for a new job. It's gotten past enough, I'm not crying at the drop of a hat lately but it's not any better.  I'm sick of that sneaky bastard saying I'm not working hard enough to get full time hours when I work a damn site harder than three quarters of the pet shop staff. 
I really don't know where to go though. I mean sure I can slot in to just about any retail job but talking to Leo tonight as he's throwing out all these stories and ideas of where I could go (mainly galleries) I was irritatingly anti everything. I still wonder if I could cope with the frivolities of cosmetics or if it would be a good idea to follow in by brothers footsteps and get into hospitality (busy, physical ect).

While in bed I dabbled in some sulpture today, my dad's birthday is coming up and it's been a tradition since I was about 8 to give him a mermaid of some creation. After that there's Bexie's going away gift of a gothic faery and an idea for a painting to enter into a student exhibition (under Ellen's name perhaps)."

I'll start again in the spring when I can afford heat lamps or some such. For now I'll give Louise my four fish and put the tadpoles in the big heated glass tank. Meh poor froggies.

Yesterday was happy and lazy. I was woken up by Garry wriggling his arms around me and smoothing my hair down. As anyone who reads my silly lj would know, things are a little crap between us and the moment so I immediately thought he wanted one thing and mumbled that it's 8:30 and I want to sleep. He replied with something along the lines of ""You can sleep still with me cuddling you."" It was so plaintively sweet that I squeaked for the first time in weeks.

One more week and the worlds biggest bludger will be out of the flat!! No one has been doing a thing about him. I think he thinks that because our ex flatmate Christiane is still paying for the room that he can just stay in it as long as he can without paying a thing towards power. But hey, Christiane owes us over $400 so he's not our favorite person right now! I'm going to try to be direct but tactful and offer to get him the flat account number so that he can put the $17.50 for power and phone for each of the weeks he's been staying directly into the account. Because cash in a box is worth nothing to bills. This is a nice way to get around the fact that he thinks he can get away with not paying for the three weeks he's been in the flat since coming back from overseas. RAAARR

Garry turned up at 5:30am on the dot this morning talking a mile a minute about how it was easier to come to my place than his... I think because mine is on the way to Tris's and they shared a taxi? I was still in sleepy land! But he was so bubbly and happy with his rambles.

One included how Zoe (the happiest, most enthusiastic hippy child in the world)was feeling really down at the party because it was just the same as last time. People getting drunk, telling the same stories and all having pants off time (3am).
Garry: So if you could be doing anything right now what would it be?
Zoe: Probably taking Ecstasy?
G: No no no. I mean anything. Snorkeling in tahiti. Anything.
Z: Snowboarding!
(enter talk of soft powder and flood lights)
G: I would be sitting in a field with my four closest friends, drinking red wine and looking at the stars.

That apparently went on for a while and he managed to cheer her up. I told him it's his special talent and one of the things that makes him lovely.

What would I have been doing? Something surprisingly close to Garry but more spicific. Out near the graveyard in Port there's a field on a hill with a single tree spreading it's branches out wide. There's a rope swing dangling from one side and when you swing out over the hill it's thrilling how high you feel. To be out there at night -with tea lights hanging from the branches and a simple picknic of food, dessert and wine- that's my idea of heavenly sweet. Just half a dozen people. Oh and mink blankets!"

Today has been an aweful day of tears and later calling Garry names through txt (Heartless bastard then blatantly teasing ""oh I'm sorry, how about gutless barstard"") to get him to answer my plee to see him at some point tonight. Ellen was busy and once he realised I actually did have a really sad day (I don't even understand why) he was somewhat sweet. I'm wondering if my brain isn't coping with the extra hormones from going on the pill. I really hope not because it makes things so damn easy.

On the upside Donna let us all pick a toy for our pets out of this bargain box of end of line stuff. I got a colourful bird that crackles. Sea Gull found it and started playing before I even took it off the card.

I'm turning into a space cadet, I've been forgetting words, clutzing stuff and stressing unnessasarily. Next week will be better."

I do like having my Thursdays so so as to sleep until twelve and then read whatever I find lying around Garry's room (this time was Vampirates. Please don't ever read this book if you have an intelligence level over 12 years. But apparently a $6 story on vampires and pirates was too much to pass up). 

I'm handing ut at Allen hall once again on a friday night, this time in order to avoid my painting. She has a face sketched in now but I know next time I pick up that brush I'm going to cover over it at least a half dozen times. 

I'm doing a massive clean out of my room because I'm hopefully moving... to another room in my house. The evil hippies have finally called it quits between them and both want to move out. So now me and Jez are filling three rooms and mid semester doesn't start for another month or two. Crap. But hey it means I can finally get Kat's room with the awesome windows that make one feel they live in a tree house. My room is the biggest in the house (I hate big rooms) with a skylight and a whole wall of storage space. I don't give a crap what Kat says, I'll fill my room as easily as hers.

Garry and I are still ""working on things"". He's concerned I wanted him back because it's just easier and he took me back out of lust. Not what I wanted to hear after a night of pints but I kinda brought stuff up. Whoopsie daisies. Anyway we're having our space and spending our time together on a nice ballance and giving things a chance to go back to the good times. If it does, sweet. If not then we try to just be friends. I'm not giving up hope yet but I still find it hard to care and be anything but resigned.

Hope all my pretty little darlings are doing well."

We got talking about another person we both know and the rumours he's been fueling with his repeated mention of them. It's just not funny, he's being a prat from what I hear and it's none of his business. But why when indescresions happen is it always the woman that gets picked on?

Then I turned an adult age so I had to get a job, flat and then came the friends ect. It really was about time but there's still moments I feel all confuzzled by the sudden extreme changes. 

-At some point I became a trustworthy person. Two have said they learnt to trust me sooner than they have other friends. I always though my stand on not getting involved, letting people talk to me when they choose and to only give advice when asked was sort of selfish but one person at least has said it's made it easier for them to tell me things because I don't drag it out. Huh.

-Sailing was fantastic, there were dolphins and we were awesome.

-Picnic went well but there's so much food to eat still. There were new memories made, many by that damned can of whipped cream. It's caused far more issues than any food item should. 

-I just fished one really huge mouse out of the picnic basket! I set it up in a home and will release it as soon as the weather dries out.

-Art is going fantasticly since I got a few new markers and a big big pad.

Ruth and I spent half an hour politely refusing to go to any of the food places the other suggested but she didn't really get shitty until dad and I tried to use majority rules and go to a fast food place. Well we thought it was funny.

The parentals are complaining that I've been home for less than two hours and already I'm walking around in a towel (it felt too good being naked to put clothing back on), taking up both phone lines (mum says hi) and drank half the soy milk.

"event","It was my graduation today. 
It went really well, I did not trip up when I got my certificate. 
I spoke to a couple of my firneds on the course. Got some pics with them. I am gutted I didnt get a picture taken with Imran though. Oh well

Im kinda sad right now. As much as I have moaned about being at uni I feel like im gonna miss it loads. I have spent four years with these people and its gonna be weird not being with them next year. 

I spent most of my time at university wishing for it to end and now it is hear I wish i could go back.&nbsp; 

There is one thing I am not gonna miss and that is being poor. I cant wait for my first pay cheque. I am not sure what I will do with all the money. I'm defo investing in a new car; either a migan or a astra and i promised ash i would buy her a nintendo wii.

Btw i got a first class honours by the way. There was only four people in the whole year who got one. So yeah!!

Also I have lost all my numbers in my phone so if people could txt me with there numbers then that would be great. My mob number is 07783880460.

Im gonna go and get some food. I have not eaten all day. I might post some pics of my graduation but people need to tell me how to do it."

"event","Well Xmas hols are over. Im back at uni for 11 weeks then im finished for good hopefully *fingers crossed*

Ive spent most of the hols sleeping. The first term had really taken it out of me.

I went to see killswitch engage on sunday at rock city. It was fucking brillaint. We arrived at 7pm and somehow got to the front of the que (it was massive by the way). Ive never to right to the front at a concert before. Ive got a couple of rows from the front but never infront of the barrier.  It was one of the best concerts ive has ever been to. Well im bound to say that im obessed about killswitch engage. I got to shake Howard Jones(lead singer) hand and i stole Adam D's wrist band when he jumped into the crowd. All in all it was a great night and i got some lovely pic of them *drools*

I cant wait to see stone sour again in Birmingham, should be a fun day out and corey taylor has dynamite nips! Im counting the days to march 11th"

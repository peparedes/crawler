"event","Yeah, so0 i go online today, and im just posting crap on Gaiaonline, and here, when my ex im's me with a new account ( I blocked her old one) and her display pic is of her getting boned by her new bf (the one she ran off with when we went to six flags) and she just keeps going on and on about how great sex is and how he's so great and so on. Then she says all her girl friends now hate me because she told them to hate me. Then i get s crap load of hate mail. Aren't I a lucky boy? ....Why do i live? It makes no sense to me.No one wnats me on Earth, hell, i dont even want to be here. I figure the only worth while thing on this God Forsaken planet is romance, love, and a family. But it seems things like this are out of my reach."

Fuck, i didnt want to take a goddam $50 prom pic, which by the way really suck, the background was crappy, the photographer was shakey and i didnt want to. Then i think one of my friends is really mad at me, but it's stupid, cuz i told her, ""I'm sry, i'm tired, i layed my head down and fell asleep! I'm so sorry!"" and she is all like, ""Yeah, whatever, bye."" I hate my fuckin life. I feel so horrible and lonely. I just want to die..."

"event","Ok, i dunno, i was feeling depressed again. Different reasons, but anyways, i dunno, i was thinking about death. I dont ever wanna die. When i find that special girl I love, i want to live and be with her forever. I've decided upon research i've done (yes, i do research things, and like yeah. it's weird.) I need to find the Holy Grail and the Spear of Longinus (or the Spear of Destiny) Legends hold that these items give whoever has them immortality. Also it may give me the power to choose the fate of the world. I want to research more, but it is very difficult to get text on these items, their whereabouts, and whatever other legends are tied with them. I guess i'm being a pyscho now. So i'll stop writing about that. Um, lets see, today I got in an hour of practice driving. Then, basically hung out at home."

It was kinda lonely there cuz i went to the mall alone. No one to really talk to. Heh, i need friends XP. Oh well. Let's then i just walked the mall, window shopping of course. Later on, my dad let me drive my car around the block for a little training. It was fun. I so cannot totally wait until i get my liscence! Yay! that will be so awesome! Oh Lolly, you can probably expect me and Chelsea to go and visit you. Let's all get wasted together!"

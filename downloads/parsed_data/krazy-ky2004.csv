""So Sick""

Mmmm mmm yeah
Do do do do do do do-do
Ohh Yeah

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
Cuz right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
Cuz you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(it's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just
(can't get over us)
And I'm stronger then this
(enough is enough)
No more walkin round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Dont make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

Cuz I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
Why can't I turn off the radio"

"event","Why wont Arron just go away... i was so proud of myself for how well i was coping with the whole end of kylie and arron... and then arron spoils it makes me more like forces me to remember how much i love him... hes so RUDE! He could at least pretend hes happy cause he knows im happy... WAS happy until now but nooo he has to be a stupid little boy and make me feel like this is all my fault making me feeling guilty.... making me want him back..... its sooooo annoying how boys do that just when you think you've found someone new they confuse you all over again!  AND! i was soooo happy cause i saw micheal today he was wearing hes brown coat i prefer that one he looks a bit gay in the white one LOL.... anyways sheleen was no where to be found so i yet again got no where in my investigation to find out if hes single!!


AND another thing why did arron send me a present for what would of been our 14 month anniversary!! why does he do this to me WHY!!! Anyway so right this minute he is making me feel more and more guilty i want to block him but i cant its just something i couldnt do.... yes due to me loving him.... i wish i didnt i wish arron wasnt so horrible about everything i hate him but i dont if u understand!"

Arron says:

Ky- R.I.P Nicholas   says:

Arron says:
You see thats how i know you were never faithful i bet all the stuff with darren was true i never once was unfaithful i was completly devoted to you.... your my soul mate and i love you

Ky- R.I.P Nicholas   says:

"event","just watching eastenders... really upset me was so sad made me think about my grandad and how much i miss him, and my aunty she was so young when she died I was only 4 when she died but she was my best friend we did everything together... my aunty la la la i dont no why i called her la la la i think it was cause i couldnt really say angela!

I would do anything to have them back... if i think back to when they were here its amazing how much a family can change without them half the things wouldnt of happened if they were still here.... ive got myself all tearful now and need to go and read my letter my aunty wrote me when i was younger... i sometimes read it over and over again and it feels as if shes saying it all to me now the bit that always gets to me is when she says "" i miss you loads"" makes me feel like i was meant to find this letter cause she wanted to tell me she misses me... i only found it last year when me and my mum were sorting out my baby stuff..... made me cry so much.... when my aunty 1st died and i will always remember this u may not believe it but i no its true and so does my mum.... well just as she died i kissed her on her cheek and said ""i love you aunty"" and then my mum told me to go upstairs and colour a picture for angela... so i went and it was like as my auntys spirit left her body she stopped of to say bye to me.... i was colouring my picture and she was there talking to me telling me what colours to do.. telling me she had to go away but she promised she will always be there for me! and then she was gone.... when my mum came upstairs she told me anglea had to go away so i told her yer i know she just told me and she helped me with my colouring.... i showed my mum the picture and she was amazed straight away she knew this must be true because of how well i had done the picture....she spoke to this woman i dont remember who she was she had some special job all i remember is she had curly hair... and she said that things like that can happen when a child has such a strong relationship with the person..... 

i was once told by a psycic i have a guardeun(sp) angel looking after me .... and i believe her..... and up until this day now i belive my aunty kept her promise and is my guardeun angel.... I love you Aunty Angela and miss you loads too always will until we are reunited again... just wanted you to know not a day goes by that i dont stop missing you"

"event","Yesterday after school i went to meet sheleen because it was like 2 and thats to early to go home so i txted her and she said to meet her at turnham green! so i got there at round 2.15ish and i couldnt find her and there was police everywhere and an ambulance so me being me started to worry it had something to do with sheleen but it didnt phew! so i saw sheleen she was with rubz and we walked through the park back to her house, while she told me what the police where there for.... some man had be hit around the head with an iron pole and was lying on the floor with blood coming out his head and the pole next to him...SCARY! so we continue our little walk through the park just talking about everything ..... i can really tell sheleen anything which is strange seeing as shes my mums friend and i wouldnt usually confide in a friend of my mums incase they tell my mum what ive said.... but i can really trust sheleen and i know for sure she will never go back and tell my mum.... so i told her about dean about arron about sam about darren and about everything else that upsets me and she was so shocked at how much ive had to go through when im only 17! it felt good to talk to her about it.... telling an adult made me feel very grown up.... anyway we start talking about her life and she then shocks me by telling me shes 42!!!!!! :O seriously if you was to see this woman she looks like shes in her 20's i was so shocked at first i thought she was lying but then i realised she was being serious.... she just looks sooo young and she is soo pretty!! (PLEASE ADOPT ME LOL) 

Anyways we get back to hers have a cup of tea then go to get her daughter from school..... today we went to richmond to do some shopping it was great! had soo much fun she is def the coolest 42 yr old ive ever met.... i am now at lous we meant to be watching lost tonight but lous fallen asleep so im just gana let her rest and we can watch another time!"

I was so happy to find out im in scarlets class YAY she was quite pleased aswell telling all her friends that i come to her house all the time LOL! Everything was so fun i felt like a proper teacher i was no longer being treated like some kid doing work exper i was a teachers assistent !

At playtime me and ms algar went to the staff room!! (yer im staff) she asked me to help her tak some cups bk because she hadnt taken them bk in a while she had hidden them in the cupboad LOL there was like 10 cups hidden around the place some even had mould EWW but anyways we go to the staff room and teachers that taught me when i was at that school were there it was soo weird to be having tea and biscuits with the people who taught me when i was like 7! i was on the other side now i wasnt a student i was one of them it was soo strange and u always think eww shes a teacher be good but they are just like us the was sitting in there talking about super nanny and stuff i was amazed LOL! i was also impressed with their collection of wine in the fridge! ;)

So i left at 12 and was meant to go bk to school i was then wondering if i would have a lesson because ms lee hasnt been in all week so i rang the school and they told me she werent in YAY i was gana go bk to work but then i saw sheleen (scarlets mum - the one i want 2 adopt me LOL) so instead i went bk to her house for lunch! i feel proper grown up today and next week we going on a trip i think its to gunnsbury park should be fun!"

When I got that phone call this morning I didnt know what to do..... I felt like I had just been stabbed in my stomach...... School was going sooooo slow I just wanted to get out of there away from everyone...... I was scared to go to the hospital..... I wasnt sure how it would be i've never been through anything like this before........ But once I got on that bus home I decided I had to go.... no matter how scared I am of hospitals Lou needed me....... When I got there and the nurse took me to Lou..... She was just lying there on the bed staring...... Staring at nothing..... The nurse left us alone then Lou just burst into tears.... Which made me burst into tears I threw my stuff on the floor and gave her a big hug....... Then we both lay on the hospital bed for hours not saying anything.... Just sitting and waiting.. I dont know what we was waiting for........ At 7.00 the nurse came and said Lou could go home...... So I helped her get dressed and got her stuff and we went to get a cab..... Someone bumped into Lou on the way to the cab I nearly killed them....... But I just left them because I could see in Lou's eyes she just wanted to get home..... I made her come home with me........... Shes sleeping now..... I have to look after her make her get better.... She still hasnt said a word.... And the worst thing is its her birthday tomorrow..... This is going to be her worst birthday ever......

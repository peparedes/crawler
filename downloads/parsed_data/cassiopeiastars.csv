"event","I refuse to believe that it was my fault.  I was not the one acting irresponsably.  It was all his doing.  He was the one that made the big deal out of nothing, called me a prick, got pissed off at me.  I don't want to fight with him, and I refuse to fight with him, but I can't tell him that because he won't speak to me.  It was such a stupid reason to get upset too--it just doesn't make any sense to me. Then again, for the most part, boys don't make much sense to me."

"event","I've made a lot of mistakes in my life-I'll be the first to admit that.  And I don't want to make those same mistakes again.  I don't want to hurt people intentionally because of how I feel.  I don't want to influence decisions that have to do with their lives, and have my influence be biased because of my personal feelings.  I did that once, and it messed up our entire relationship.  So am I to not advise?  Not care?  I don't know.  It's all too confusing for me."

"event","Today I decided to pack up everything that reminded me of our friendship.  I picked up one of those snow-globe type things that he'd given me for my birthday about 3, 4 years back and it slipped out of my hands and shattered on the floor.  My roommate was there and just looked at me.  As soon as it fell, I gasped, and started crying.  It was so bloody symbolic it was sickening.  I know it was just a thing, but it had a lot of sentimental value to it.  That's what happens to us girls.  We become sentimental about these things.  So I cried about it, cleaned it up, and packed its remnants away, along with other gifts I had, pictures-anything I have that reminds me of him.  There's a lot that reminds me of him when I think about it, but I couldn't pack up my entire life.  So I put away the things that were a direct reminder of him.  A friend of mine thought I should just throw them all out; he had a hard time understanding why I couldn't.  There are just too many memories there.  I can't throw them away.  Plus, I still have a shred of hope that maybe things are reparable, and that he'll realize that he's losing me forever, and try to work things out.  I know it's most likely not true, and even if it isn't, I still have so many great memories, I want to keep them.  One day I'll be able to look at them without it hurting.  Today's just not that day."

"event","Ever notice how the more you try to make sense of a situation, the more impossible it becomes to do that?  Or maybe it's just like that for me.  Things have been weird lately on various levels.  I've always been the girl that's the friend to the guys, listening to everything they tell me about their girlfriends or partying or whathaveyou.  It's just a thing-I've always gotten along better with guys.  A lot of girls have trouble understanding this--I shouldn't say that-the girls that have trouble understanding this are the girls that are always on the prowl, looking for their next boy.  Their motto is 'gotta have a boyfriend' so they can't ever get to the same level that I have with the guys, the level where you get beyond all the bullshit and the worries about sex interfering with the relationship and you get to the relationship itself.  You learn who they are, their hopes, their dreams, the things that they won't tell their guy friends because they have to keep up the 'macho' thing, and the things they won't tell their girlfriends because they're too busy working to keep the relationship going.  I'm not saying that I'm the only one that has true relationships with them, not at all.  They're just different.  For me, they're better than my relationships with girls have ever been.  So many girls are just catty, or worried so much about their boyfriends (or lack thereof), or how they're going to look when going to a club Friday night-that's just not my thing.  I just like being able to be real with people, and it has ended up that it's easier for that to happen with guys for me.  See, there is a problem with it though, and I learned it the hard way.  You can't always control how you end up feeling about people.  Sometimes things happen that you don't expect, feelings arise that you never anticipated, and then they're there.  And then what do you do?  Tell them, risk the friendship to become the girl that for years they've complained to you about?  Think that maybe, because of how close you already are, that maybe this would be different?  Or do you just shut up and keep it all bottled in, hoping it'll go away if you ignore it long enough?  Well, I tried the ignoring thing for about a year, during that time maintaining the friendship as if nothing was different.  How I felt didn't go away, so I eventually felt like I had to tell him.  I told him, and it was bad for a few days, then things went back to normal.  I thought that after telling him and not really trying to pursue it, that just by telling him, I'd get it out of my system, that everything would be fine.  It took awhile but I realized that I was wrong, so then I had the same dilemma-tell or don't tell?  I thought that by now, we were close enough to handle this in an adult-like fashion, that we're two mature people and can deal with this and we can get through it, even if it's a little difficult.  So we talked.  And it was worse than I had ever imagined.  The talk itself wasn't so bad-at times it was difficult, but that was to be expected.  The aftershocks, though-they killed us both.  I think they killed him first.  He stopped talking to me, wouldn't return my e-mails or phone calls.  I didn't understand why.  I thought things would be ok-they were before.  That was two months ago.  We still haven't spoken.  I lost my best friend because I had to be honest with him.  I thought I was doing something good for our relationship-that it would strengthen us in a way, that we'd be able to get through this.  I was wrong.  He couldn't handle it.  What this has done to my other relationships with guys is that now, I'm always on my guard.  I've become so fearful that I'll say or do something that will make the entire relationship blow up in my face that I've become passive, whereas before all of this I was much more the kind of gal that always spoke her mind, damn what people think.  Maybe it's better that I'm a little quieter now, I'm not sure.  I think it'll get better with time.  I'm still trying to adjust to my life without my best friend in it.  And my other guy friends that I've talked to about this, their response is 'Fuck him-he's weird-he won't answer his phone or your emails?  He's got problems-forget him'.  It's much easier to say than to do though.  I'm surrounded by memories of him.  After as many years of friendship as we had, it's hard not to be.  I'm slowly putting it away-the physical representations of our friendship, and hopefully out of sight will also mean out of mind.  I will always treasure everything we had as friends, and maybe one day it won't hurt to remember him.  But it still does today.  So I keep busy, don't give myself time to think or wonder about him.  I don't sleep, because those moments when you're lying in bed you have nothing to do but think, and my mind invariably wanders to him and wondering what I should or could have done differently.  And I know, one can what-if themselves to death, and life's mostly guesswork, but it doesn't stop you from wondering, wishing that there was something that you could do.  But there's not.  So you lie in bed, waiting in vain for sleep, for rest, waiting for time to pass so that it can be easier to live again."

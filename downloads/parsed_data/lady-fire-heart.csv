... Unless I have less than likeable scores and I have to retake them again. -______-

On a brighter note, I love these new journal styles. Haven't quite decided which one I like best, but I'll figure it out. <3"

"event","Well, yeah. ^^ I had mucho fun yesterday. But I ended up REALLY tired. 

I went to Mexico with the Flying Samaritans. There, we opened a one-day free clinic. I got the chance to watch doctors in action, help when it was needed, and I found out how to take blood pressure! I just need more practice though. xP Everything was really organized.

I NEED TO LEARN SPANISH. It's like, the patient starts speaking in Spanish, and it's seriously going in my ear and out the other. xP Besides, if I wanna be a doctor in California in the future, I gotta learn Spanish and Chinese...

I did end up tired. But that day, I found out that I really, really wanted a Camaro. <3333

PS: Mara, I'm just missing a sophomore girl and the two freshmen. I'll get them on Monday..."

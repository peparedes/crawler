I am choosing to abstain from this activity cos I dont feel like running again and my knee kinda hurts. Yesterday was so much fun but it kinda ended weird. Don't you hate it when your finally over someone, then something happens that get ya thinkin again. I sure as hell do. When we were out on a walk I was thinking too many things at once, it was horrible! and now I dont know what to do. 

But I saw Anchorman with devynn, it was good, I swear like 10 people from zionsville were there at the same show as us. and most of them were guys lol. but I had fun, then dev and I went and picked up meg and monica and we all went to west park, then ended up back here playing video games and stopin by and sayin hi to dave and sam, but I had lots of fun. and we havent gone to sleep all night and I have to go to church in the morning. whoops lol

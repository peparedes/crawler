"event","I wasn't going to really write in this thing anymore but I'm in the mood to write. So much has happened its too long to write every detail so I'll just put down the parts I think are important.&nbsp; So I got back together with Thomas. I wanted to make sure if it was going to work out or not. I didn't want to have the what if stuck in my head and now I don't.&nbsp; Along the ways of us being together, he proposed to me? Was it cute? Nope. Did he actually say &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; Hell no. Did I say yes anyway? Yep.<br /><br /> <lj-cut text=""Let the drama continue!"">So we get engaged. We get the banquet hall, the dress, people start buying us presents and around two or three weeks before the wedding I get this feeling. It was a feeling a had gotten a while ago. The feeling of not being ready to move out of Miami and give up everything for this guy. The first time I had this feeling, Thomas shut it out. We fought and then finally he said okay I'll wait for you. Stupid me decides that if he says he'd wait for me I believe him, so I'm going to do him a favor and not postpone the wedding. Well back to two weeks before the wedding. It happens again, only I put my foot down. Then the same thing happens, we fight, then finally he tells me he will wait. Only this time I don't take the bait, I say okay we are waiting. It was like I let out the hulk when I said that. He went crazy on me and gave me an ultimatum. Either the date stays or its over. Tis over my friend. He called me a few things, insulted me when I tried to help him, then apologized a while after. The end. I never spoke to him again and I don't know if I ever will. I mean I don't care if I do or don't I have no feelings for him anymore and I don't hate him for what he did. I'm glad this all happened for a few reasons. If it didn't happened I would have never had the time of my life doing extra curricular activities with a few people from chilis *wink* *wink*. I would have never met a really cool chick that I owe a lot to. And then of course theres the whole part that I would have been stuck to a guy that reminds me of Dr. Jeckel and Mr.Hide.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moving on to my activities after work. I got to say it got bad. I did it every day&nbsp; for two weeks straight. Barely slept,&nbsp; and just kept smiling. I knew it was bad. But it felt so good. And the people I was with made it even better. It was making me happy, so I continued until my friend Diana one day asked me a random question. She told me I would be a great sister in law, then asked me how I felt about dating a girl. I was curious honestly. I knew I got turned on by girls. But I never put two and two together that I may be gay. So I told her sure and thats when I met Leidy. She showed me I can have an amazing time without the crap I was doing after work. And I did. I didn't touch anything while we dated. Our first date was the most amazing date I have ever been on. I'm waiting for someone to beat it. She was the first person that got me to actually go all the way. Even though I was drunk I wouldn't have done it if I didn't trust her like I do. I knew from the minute I found out she had just broken up with the chick she was going to marry that I was going to get hurt if I did anything with her. But I did anyways cuz I knew she would take care of me and she did. We're just friends, and I consider her to be very close. I got over the fact that nothing more than friends will happen with us. She doesn't like me anymore than that and that's fine. I'm satisfied with her being just a friend and already getting used to seeing her as just a friend. When she texts me about how good its going with this chick shes talking to it doesn't hurt me anymore. It actually makes me smile. I'm happy for her.<br /><br />So I still don't know what I'm doing with myself. The plan is still military. But I'm not so sure, and I'm not going to stress it. I'll go where life takes me and thats that. By the way I just have to write this down. I went to go see the guy thats going to take out my wisdom teeth yesterday. We say the x-rays and I only have three. Ummmm what the fuck? Like did I seriously get ripped off at birth? What ever its less swelling on one side for me. I'm special :P</lj-cut>"

"event","Its been so long since I've updated. Get ready for a damn book. So I was reading back on all my other posts and I realized something. I never do what I say I'm going to do. It always gets changed either by me or just by the events that happen. Work has been stressful/fun/what ever expression that makes you go &quot;woooooow...seriously?&quot; Like this guy Ron, a new server, comes with a party of 8 to eat. He comes up to me and Alex, the other hostess, and asks if he could take these two tables that were opening up, 68 and 69. We look at each other for a minute both thinking, this guy is crazy, then turn to him and say no. We show him the waiting list<br />he's all the way in the bottom and we are not going to skip all these people. He needs two tables for god sakes, you really think no ones gonna notice you dumbass. So even after telling him about 20 times no, he starts asking servers if he can take those two tables... Hey dumbass, servers don't tell people where to sit, hostesses do so shut up and sit down. Anyway he made such a commotion that a manager got wind of it and asked us who was asking to skip people. I didn't want to bring a manager cuz I knew Ron would get in trouble, but his big mouth wouldn't stop asking people so oh well.&nbsp; I wasn't going to lie to a manager so I told him, and I added if Ron comes up to the hostess stand one more time I will slap him. I'm trying to do my job, I don't need him nagging at me. So he got bitched at and then came to me and Alex to bitch about being bitched at. We told him to go away. Man its not our fault you're an idiot and got yourself in trouble. But wait, there's more. After his party finishes eating they found out he brought an expired credit card. Wooooow. Top it off with fighting for his 10% discount that he's suppose to get, even though he gave <em>everyone</em> trouble that day. Jeez.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""More, more and more"">So after this semester of classes I realized that school isn't for me. I'm more of a hands on person. I decided that after these classes are over I'm going to the Navy. I've always wanted to, but was too scared of what my mom would think, and four years is kinda long. But I already talked to my recruiter, I just need to lose 20 more pounds and I'm off to meps to sign the contract. I'm happy to say that I've gotten skinnier. Ohh yeaaa. I started using the gym at miami dade yesterday, I forgot it was there.<br /><br />I've hung out with Dung and Natasha so much now. And we've drank a few times. Hehe its fun. So I talked to Thomas so he can tell me about the military. Which ended up him trying to get back with me. I know it sounds very very bad. All of my friends basically attacked me. But this time apart made him realize how good I was, and how bad he was. From what I see, the military set him straight, though I'm not completely sure since I haven't seen him face to face. I do want to get back with him, but only if he's going to be an amazing boyfriend, one I deserve. I told him I'm not getting back with him unless he sweeps me off my feet and I mean it. He's done a little more than what I mentioned on my previous journals and did come clean about something pretty bad, but I'm not gonna mention it. Then all my friends will reeaaallly not like him. So right now he's helping me pay for my car and he gave me money to get the rest of my halloween costume. Can't wait for tomorrow =]<br />When we were together he refused to take me to meet his family, which was really important to me. So this christmas we're going to his family's house and spend xmas with them or something like that. We're still trying to work things out. I couldn't really get days off before xmas only after. <br />Oh yea I got my own ps3. The backwards compatible one. Woot woot. I also bought a lot of new furniture which I regret now cuz I'm going to be gone for 4 years. Hopefully my mom won't sell my stuff... I really don't trust her with my stuff.&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","<p>Well I thought I was going to miss this semester of school since I missed the due date to pay but when I looked at my rewards it didn't show anything about the short term loan I applied for. Instead It showed that I got a grant, two grants. One for this semester and one for spring. Holy shit I actually got free money. Its for 12 credits so next semester I can squeeze one more class in. Haha this is great. I worked for the first time on togo. Man I felt bad for Shae who had to put up with my noobness. Who's ever idea it was to put me to work on a <em>friday</em> night was fucking stupid. Training was hectic since they made me host at the same time due to not having enough hostesses so I didn't really learn anything. Tonight I'll be working alone so I have about six hours to teach myself the menu and other important crap. Yay. I did get forty bucks with tips though. Yay gas money.<br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""On other news.."">I dropped off Thomas' stuff at Jimmy's house and man I felt so free. Now I have space and I don't have to worry about anything else getting damaged.&nbsp; So after that we went to Gainesville, got a hotel room, looked at UF, met this guy that wants to get in Dung's pants, and got drunk. It was my first time and I did way better than Dung. If you ever want to know something from me, get me drunk. I told them everything there is to tell from me. Next day we went to Universal and Island of Adventures. Man some of these rides where so much better when I was a little kid, haha. Jaws, Terminator, and the Jurassic Park rides were lame. I didn't get to ride the hulk or the dueling dragons, it started thundering by the time we got to them and they shut em down. Laaaame. &nbsp;</lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I recall my mom having the same problem with one of her friends, you know what she said to her? Fuck off. I tried explaining to Amanda and I apologized. What the fuck.

"event","One more week until my road trip with Dung and Natasha. Woohoo. I talked to Thomas. He didn't react like I thought he would. He matured. He was sad that I was breaking up with him, and kept asking if there was anything he could do to change my mind. There wasn't. He asked if we could still be friends. I know its a bad idea. I blocked him on AIM and set every account I have on private. I know he'd look at my messages and I know it would hurt him if I so happen to go out with a guy Dung is trying to set me up with. I told him if he ever wanted to talk though to call me. I was sad at first but I wasn't sad because we broke up. I was sad for him. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Strange..."">So I got a message from Amanda's boyfriend, John. It was on facebook. He said something about knowing that me and her don't talk but I was nice to him and she didn't ask him to message me and what not. So we started talking for a bit. Either he's telling the truth and just wants to talk oooor Amanda really did ask him to message me. Whether or not she did, I don't care. I mean it would be kinda creepy if she was asking him so she knows what I was up to but whatever. Its not like its hard to see what I'm up to when you have my lj. <br /><br />Anyways I start training for to-go tomorrow. Whoohoo! Rebbecca gets to be my trainer. Double woohoo!

"event","Okay so I'm finally moving to to-go. Yay. Danny got fired. I think I know why but what ever, he was a slacker anyways. I should start training either this Friday or Tuesday. I talked to Dung about Thomas, and she made a point about him getting crazy when he's getting dumped. So I'm not waiting for him to get out. I sent him a letter which he should get tomorrow if he hasn't already. I talked to Jimmy and I'm taking Thomas' stuff to his house. I don't want Thomas to come get it, I don't want to talk to him on the phone or in person. I don't want to deal with his immature behavior. 

Natasha and Dung are coming with me to Orlando. We're going there for two days. I think we're going to wet and wild too. This chick is paying us money to do some work for her class. So we're using that money to have this mini road trip. Dung's ex is moving back to Miami. He's already got an apartment and he's looking for a roommate. She told me about it so depending on how much the rent is he might be my ticket out of my mom's evil grasps. Heh, she really is getting on my last freaking nerve. 

Well thats that. I'm now officially single again and I'm not emo about it. I'm feeling more adventures. =]"

"event","I had a dream about breaking up with Thomas. If it was hard to say it in a dream then its definitely going to be hard when I have to really do it. I know he isn't going to take it well. The first time I broke up with him he told me to eat shit and die, shove the idea of us maybe getting together in the future up my ass, and hoped that it would eat me for the rest of my life. Heh, that should have told me not to get back with him, but eh, I'm dumb. In my dream Natasha and Dung were there when I broke up with him. He told me he wanted to pick up his stuff. I don't know if he'll change his mind when I tell him its over but if he does I do want someone with me. He is pretty violent, and when he's mad he's pretty damn stupid. Who knows what he'd try to do.

He's the kind of guy that doesn't care if its a girl or a guy, he'll fight you. He has punched this one girl for touching him when he told her not to. He's not abusive, but he's got the potential to be."

"event","So today I got my laptop back. Woot! My dad was messing with it and saw that only the hard drive got fried. So he bought me a new one and here it is. My mom is such a bitch. She kicked my sister and myself out of the house so that she can bring a guy home. I wasn't even allowed to pass by to grab a pair of jeans. She went crazy at the mention of passing by. I don't know what she said, I put the phone down till she shut up then just hung up on her. I slept over Dung's house, I didn't even want to go back home. God I need to get out of here. I wish I had financial aid for school so that I could afford to move but oh well. Dung offered to move at her house since her brother is leaving and they'll have an extra room. That would be sweet, but I'm just going to avoid being home when my mom is, that always works. Thomas finally answered about where he wants me to leave his stuff. He said he'd just pick it up when he comes to see me. God he's going to hate me. Once he's out of boot camp I'm breaking up with him. This time alone gave me time to think about everything. My future isn't with him.

Dung wants to move to Gainsville next year. I might be joining her. I hope I join her. Its nice up there and I'll be away from my crazy family. That's always a plus. Last night I went to the ice arena with Dung and Natasha. I haven't seen Natasha since high school. We use to hang out a lot till I started to get annoyed with her. Hehe I might be talking to her more often now. After the arena we went to Coconut Grove so they can take me to a Hukka Bar. Failed. It was packed so we paid $9 parking for nothing and left. Oh wells. Harry Potter is almost out, can't wait."

"event","I got my car back today. The guy did a nice job, a lot more work than what I paid. Lucky me. I'm heading back to school this fall. I've already skipped two semesters, I can't skip anymore. I'm anxious to go back, despite my lack of&nbsp;interest for school. No more slacking off. I talked to Thomas a few days ago. It was short, and its given me more motive to move on. Two little things bothered me. One was when I told him I was in a car accident, he wasn't concerned if I was hurt or not. The other thing was while I was telling him about the accident he interrupted me saying &quot;well I got to go so bye.&quot; I don't if its just me, but I wouldn't say bye to my other half that way after not speaking to each other for a month. 

I didn't try to get him to stay a little longer. Just an &nbsp;&quot;Oh...okay...&quot; kinda thing. I wrote a letter to him telling him I'm moving to my dad's house so I can't hold his belongings anymore. I'm not moving in with my dad, but I don't want to hold his stuff. His computer fried on me and his cord for the ps3 died. I don't want anything else breaking while I'm holding it. I know if and when I break up with him&nbsp; he'd bitch about those two things. He gets very violent when it comes to break ups. When I told him it was over the first time he went crazy. He said a lot of nasty things. Heh, I remember telling him maybe in the future we can get back together. He told me to shove that idea up my ass. Yet here he is.

The more I look back, the more I think about breaking up with him. He's definitely not the guy I want to grow old with, and right now I just want to have fun. That guy Jose tells me every time we work together&nbsp; to make out with him in the back now. Honestly if I was single I wouldn't mind. He's hot."

"event","I got into a car accident today. Right when I was turning into the shopping center at work, bam. It was my fault. I'm not hurt, and the car isn't that badly damaged. The guy didn't have his license, and it wasn't his car. Neither of us didn't want to call the cops, so we didn't. I freaked out. He asked me what I wanted to do. I had no idea. I called my mom, which didn't answer. Old daddy came to the rescue. We exchanged everything numbers and all that but we our going to pay for our own crap. When my mom decided to call all she did was yell. I cried. Its sad that I wasn't scared for my life when he hit me. No. The thought going through my head was &quot;mom is going to make my life miserable after this&quot;. Its already started. She yelled about not calling the cops and letting the guy go. If I did that, I'd get the ticket, I'd have to pay for both cars, and my insurance would go higher. 

My dad calmed me down. He was actually there for me, not making it worse like my mom. He told me something that he's told me before, something that I would just laugh at in my head. He said if I ever got tired of living with my mom, that I always could go with him. The more I think of it, the better it sounds. If I went with him, I could get financial aid. If I went with him, I wouldn't have my money taken from me like my mom does. I'd be free to have my own life. I wouldn't have a room and I'd sleep on a couch but hell I'd be moving forward."

I get paid this Friday so if he can't by then I'm going to have to give him money. I need my cell for work. I could tell my dad has been lonely. His wife and step kids went back to er, where ever it is they came from, (&gt;.&gt;) so they can get their dental and all that crap done since its cheaper. They aren't coming back till next month so he's home alone. He sent me pics he made on photoshop of me and him. It was kinda sad. I never liked him, and I know that he knows he hasn't been the best. He's trying to make it up with his new step kids, even though that's not how you're suppose to fix things. But anyways, my bad feelings for him have died. I tried to surprise him Thursday since he didn't know I got my car. Failed. He stayed late at work that day, but I went with my sister yesterday. We made an old man happy. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""I want oreos...."">So before I left to his house he told me to bring my tower. I did. We found out that Thomas' monitor wasn't the problem, it was the video card. It was blown. We also found out that he's got a virus on his motherboard. We can't put xp, or vista or even format it. The only thing he could do was put 98 safe mode. I left the tower there so he can try and play with it. He gave me a new and better video card too. The only bad thing is I think I'm going to be stuck with linux. (&gt;_&lt;) I want my windows back already.<br /><br />My dad also showed me this site,&nbsp;ecost.com. It's got these&nbsp;electronics for a bit cheaper than stores.&nbsp;I was looking&nbsp;at the&nbsp;TV's. I want a Samsung 22 inches.&nbsp;My dad also gave me this really nice music player for the car. I just have to&nbsp;buy a power adapter and install it. Woot. I hope it&nbsp;fits... Anyway since I don't dislike him anymore I'm going to be a good little daughter and make him happy. I have to go visit him soon again to pick up the tower. I miss having my own computer.<br /><br />I magically found my Xbox cord. It was all mixed up with&nbsp;some of Thomas' wires. Jeez he's got so much crap that he doesn't want to throw away, even though he doesn't use it. I bet if I&nbsp;threw them away he wouldn't even notice. But anyways, since I found the cord&nbsp;I have to buy a PS3 cord for him. Though&nbsp;I might just give him the&nbsp;cord I get for my PS3 since&nbsp;I'm going&nbsp;to be getting the HDMI cable. But we'll see. I seriously think I won't be able to go&nbsp;to Texas though... I need to pay insurance and&nbsp;the car payments plus I need to take my car to Jiffy Lube on this paycheck. Plus pay for the cell that I&nbsp;desperately&nbsp;need. Then after this pay&nbsp;check I get just one more&nbsp;before&nbsp;July 24. Its going to be a close call.<br /><br />A few days ago the gross guy from&nbsp;Chilis that hit on me tried to kiss me. First he asked if he could on the cheek, I said no. He tried, I pulled away.

"event","So I've been thinking since I want to fight to just learn how to fight and not finish my degree. I was looking around my area for some martial arts schools and guess what I find. Its a school that also has classes for law enforcement. I can get my unarmed and armed security license and learn bodyguard/ executive protection, concealed weapons and armed and unarmed combat. . I don't know whether I'm still going to go to Dade but I'm sure as hell going to this place.<br /><br />I got a call from a random military guy two days ago. I couldn't understand what he was saying except base and Texas, so I knew it was about Thomas. He wanted to let me know that he was doing good and the graduation for sure is July 24. He said I <em>should</em> be getting a packet about the graduation soon. I don't think Thomas put me down as family or anything so I don't know, but then again, this dude had my number. I might not be able to go to graduation though. I'm going to be getting my car probably in the next couple of days. My mom is going to help me pay for a Chevy Cavalier that we saw at a dealer ship. Its a 2002 and it looks nice. I told her I wont need help with car payments, but I do for insurance. She said she will pay it and give me $1,000 for the car. Heh, she actually realized how much she owed me this time. But if I get the car I can't afford to go to Texas, and I really need that car. <br /><br />What ever that guy's name was asked when was the last time I heard from Thomas. He was surprised when I told him I haven't heard from him since he's left. Has Thomas been given the chance to call me and just hasn't? I don't know but I guess I'll find out soon. Its sad how far the thought of being with him has drifted so much. I've changed my mind about moving, I want to stay in Miami. Me just wanting my own ps3 is kinda bad.&nbsp; I already have his, the only reason I'd want my own is because I want it just in case we don't last. Which means I don't have faith in our relationship. Oh boy I'm in trouble now. I'm going to need some mental preparation for these next two months. <br /><br />I've been missing out on sleep lately, and its because I'm anxious. Not for Thomas, not for the car, something else. Too bad I don't know what. To make matters worse last night I had a stomach attack. I have no idea what happened. All I know is one minute I'm perfectly fine coming back from work. I get to bed by 1:00 a.m. Next thing I know I'm dreaming about a guest at Chili's trying to get sat when we're closed, and bam. The pain comes. I then realize Its not just my dream, I'm really in pain. It was weird. It was a mix of that feeling you get when you're about to throw up, with the cramps girls get, with a tad bit of empty stomach pains. I tried to throw up, but nothing came. I went downstairs to eat something, in case it was because of an empty stomach, But damn man I've been hungry before and this was really painful. The pain didn't go away, just kinda went down for about two minutes. Then bam, it comes back again.&nbsp;<br /><br />It was about 3:00 a.m. when I went back up to my room. Failed to fall asleep. I found Pepto Bismal pills. I took them to force myself to throw up. I couldn't think of anything else to do, and I did. The pain still didn't go away but I eventually fell asleep. Good thing its gone for today. Hopefully it won't come back, I like my sleep. =( <br /><br />"

"event","I've never wanted to fight so much in my life. I blame Bleach for all this. I was reading the manga. Yoruichi is&nbsp; fucking awesome. I already have been wanting to fight, seeing her kick some ass just built my drive for it even higher. Even in my dreams I'm going at it with someone. I want to fight professionally, but I get disappointed when I watch female pros. Like I said they're more padded up, like little babies. Fuck that. If you don't want to get bashed on, don't fight.&nbsp; I was watching MMA, boxing ad kick boxing. They just don't appeal to me.&nbsp; Boxing and kick boxing are lame. I would want to do MMA except most of the time the opponents are rolling around on the floor. I want something like from the movie Fight Club. There was this Japanese kick boxing. Now that was sweet. No gloves and no rolling around on the floor. Too bad Its not here and they probably don't have one for chicks.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Gah.."">If I don't get into fighting, then I do want something physical. Like a body guard. I want to protect something. Heh, I've always wanted to protect my friends. Physically and mentally, even though I can't do that forever.. How the hell do you become a body guard anyways? I'm getting my degree in Criminal Justice but being some average cop is just too boring. Now if I got on the SWAT team, that would be fun. Maybe I should have joined the military. The real reason I didn't is because my family. I hate how they use the excuse of a girl isn't suppose to do that. My aunt and gramma really piss me off with that. Especially my aunt. I remember when she was talking to me about making sure when I buy a car to have a jack and a spare tire. She went on and on about calling a guy to do it if I ever got a flat tire. No, I'm not weak. I can handle myself thank you. Yes I can change the oil too. I don't need to pay some mechanic $30 to do it. It's not rocket science and so what if you get dirty. That's what showers are for. Duh.<br /><br />Anyways, I have start learning the menu from Chili's. Bleh. I think I'm going to train for to-go before Danny. If thats the the case, he's going to be pissed. Hehe. He asked about it before I did. But its not my fault I impressed a manager and he wants to move me first. XD<br />Rebecca says she sees it in me, and I have the smile for it. I know she wants me to do it and not Danny. She says I'd definitely be her replacement. If Danny goes first they'll still keep Rebecca in to-go. Hell she might just be telling me crap to get me to go in. I know Jenny does that. She was always telling me I could handle it by myself so that she wouldn't have to work Monday. They aren't suppose to have a newbie like me work by myself but her husband is a wanna be manager. I'm sure she did some crap talking to make me work. <br /><br />It doesn't matter though, more hours for me. I'm still a little un comfortable working by myself but it will pass. I do pretty good for the most part. As for Rebecca being like that, I don't get a bad vibe from her so I don't think she's just saying it to get me to do it. My first impression of her was that she was nice and bubbly. (What ever that means) . But even if she was like Jenny, to-go is better than hostess. Plus I wouldn't have to deal with cranky&nbsp; guests that can't wait&nbsp; over ten minutes to get a table. If you don't like it don't come to the busiest Chili's in America, ya moron. It's funny when a party of 15 walking ten minutes before we close expecting to get sat. I laugh right in their face. A wait time for a party that big is usually over an hour , unless we just opened or something. Sorry Charlie, no table for you.<br /><br />Still no word from Thomas. I already asked a week off around the time he should be graduating. Though if I don't hear from him I won't be able to go. I know he wasn't taking the communicating with me very seriously before he left, bastard. Three weeks, almost a month. It feels longer though. I know if its going to be like this all four years, which it probably will be. I won't be able to stay with him. I want something normal already.<br /><br />I've been hit on by three guys that work at Chili's. Two of the chefs, and one server. The server is disgusting though. He's not ugly. But he's so perverted and horny, its gross. Last week or something Ian took me to work. (My personal taxi ;p) He asked me if there was a really hot guy working at Chili's. I don't think any of the guys are hot, but there is one guy who is very attractive. He's really flirty and playful.&nbsp; Any chance he gets he messes with me in various ways. If I'm trying to pass him in a narrow space, he'll press up against me. I yell at him, and he tells me &quot; let's just get this over with and make out in the back&quot;. Cocky Little bastard.</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

The second time I did my mom was yelling at me for not taking halls while I had my head on the toilet. Thanks for caring mom. I'm bettter now though, just a runny nose. I have completely forgotten about Amanda, so I don't regret what I did. I don't even think of her. The only time I did was when I left my phone at chili's and someone took it. They called here I guess by mistake, I forgot to delete her number. But she called me back to see what was up. I do feel bad for that because I had to say i didnt mean to call her, but there's nothing i can do so oh well.

I would be driving my car, except I have a mom that's a bitch. Yay.&nbsp; I should have bought it by this week, but her car broke down and she took $1,000 to fix it. It sucks, but understandable. Next pay check comes in and she goes and buys a brand new dinning set; $1,100 was the price. I want to slap her. She goes and buys something for herself instead of paying me back and has the nerve to complain about not getting sleep because she has to pick me up at midnight from work. We wouldn't have the problem if she wasn't selfish. And when I ask her when will I get my car she yells at me saying its not her fault her car broke down.

I need to get out of this house. My sister is like a little mini me of my mom. She's just as crazy and bitchy as her and its stressful as hell. I'm sick I shouldn't be dealing with crap from my own family. 
I haven't heard from Thomas for the past two weeks. We almost parted on a bad note. He was being stupid, really stupid, and I wasn't going to stand for it. Whether its his last day or not, he doesnt have the right to be a jackass. We did kiss and make up before he went to tampa to wait for the shuttle bus. When I was at work the wave of depression finally hit me.&nbsp; I rented resident evil 5 so I could have something to do when I'm not working. Its fun as hell, I want to buy it.

"event","Yesterday was great. This hostess Jennifer wasn't feeling too good, so she asked me to come in. She stayed in the back rolling silverware in case I had any trouble she could just come to the front. Well since I'm a newbie, they always have someone up front with me, so I don't freak out like this other new guy Danny did. But since she was staying in the back, it was my chance to look good in front of Emilio, one of the managers. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""It's all that AND a bag of potato chips =]"">So I pretended that Jennifer wasn't even there. I did my thing, and the manager was very happy. He kept complimenting how I kept my cool when a huge rush of people came in, and I didn't even need help. I kept control of the crowd. I always had my smile. Welcomed and said good night to everyone. It was a pretty good feeling. When Jennifer was leaving she told me she was shocked that I didn't need her help. This chili's is the busiest one in America, and it gets pretty crazy at night. I feel bad that Danny wigged out and couldn't handle it. But I also feel good that he was on a lunch shift thats a lot easier than the dinner shift and I was able to do it. <br /><br />When I was leaving Emilio wanted to give me a Chili Head pin, some kind of award thing, but they didn't have any so he'll probably give it to me tonight. He also gave me a pin of a heart, because I showed that I had heart or something. Hehe sounds kind of cheesy but hey, it impressed him. He told me I was his new superstar and I just proved to them that I'm no rookie. <br /><br />Oh there was this one waiter that was so going to be put on my hit list. I had a party of 8 come in and the only table where I can fit them in was seven and eight. The bad thing is seven belongs to one server, Igor, and eight to Leo. So I go to Igor for the heads up and to talk to Leo how they want to split it. He got all mad and was telling me &quot;its really obnoxious when one of you (the hostess) puts those two together. Now&nbsp; one of us gets fucked. Thanks, really.&quot; I just smiled and walked away. It's not my fault these people come in big damn parties and those two tables are the only ones I can put together. (&gt;_&lt;)<br /><br />But the good thing is when his shift was over he came up to apologize that It's my job to sit people down where ever I can, that it shouldn't be taken out on me, blah blah blah. He said its just that he hates the place. He's been working there for a few years, so he gets cranky, and he asked If I can just be patient with him and its no hard feelings.<br /><br />Hehe, as long as he apologizes I'm good. Oh Kramer, Jennifer's husband, he's the one that took me to work today. My god he loves to accelerate. I bet he wastes a lot of gas. He'll go really fast then brake when he's about to hit the car in front. He turned to me and said, &quot;Sorry, I drive like a jackass.&quot;</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Woohoo I woke up at 9:30. That's pretty good considering I always wake up around 6:00 or 7:00. I was remembering how bad I was when I was a kid. There was a time where this boy tripped me in the playground and I got up and punched the day lights out of him. Hehe. Too bad I had to sit all day in the corner. I was also really mean to my brother. Once he had a kite and I asked him if I can use it. He told me to wait like five minutes, but I was impatient. So i kicked him in the shin, made him fall, and ran away when it started to rain. Then there was the time I had one of those tiny kid jeeps you drive and was skating in front of me really slow. So I ran him over. 

Haha. This last one wasn't too bright of an idea. He and our neighbor were playing catch with a baseball and I wanted to play. But he told me no, so my little evil mind went to work. I wanted to get him in trouble. Sooo I waited for the right timing then ran right into the ball when he threw it. Haha. It was immediate black out. All I remember was coming in and out of consciousness on the floor, and hearing my mom yell at my brother. I so killed his childhood.

Its funny. I was a little evil child back then, and now I'm an extreme push over. I need to get more of that bitchy side back. Just a little. It's a good thing Thomas is the complete opposite of me. I'm already starting to take on his &quot;don't give a damn&quot; traits. It's also a good thing that he's becoming a lot nicer because of my traits. Hehe. Maybe we'll make a complete switch. =p"

"event","<br />Well time to explain what happened yesterday, yay. Well Thomas and I started talking about why people cheat, and how they get bored and what not. I gave him a scenario. If we tried every possible position in sex, except anal, would he get bored. He kept avoiding the question, which started to get me mad. Then all of a sudden he turns everything around and told me if I wasn't going to do anal then I should leave. He said from the&nbsp;beginning he told me he wanted to try <em>everything </em>and that I agreed to that. Which of course, was a lie. When he told me that I told him I&nbsp;wasn't going to try everything. I'm sorry, but the idea of shoving something up my ass back and forth doesn't sound very nice. Maybe in the future I'll change my mind, but not now.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""And?"">So I ask him again and telling him if he's going to get bored and leave me because of one dumb position, then tell me now. I rather break up now then in the future where we might be married or have kids. That's when he told me if I was going to be like that then leave. So that's it. He was breaking up with me. I cried for about ten seconds. Then I blacked out. All I remember was telling him fuck a lot and to go to hell. I gained a little control after that, enough not to punch any hollow walls or hard enough to break my hand. Heh, the old me&nbsp; would have just curled up in a ball and cried all day.<br />&nbsp;<br />Well I used my title from before as my AIM message, people thought I was cutting myself. Karen randomly messaged and asked if I was okay. I don't know if she said anything else because Meebo&nbsp;has horrible connection and I wasn't getting all of her messages, as she&nbsp;was not getting mine. But&nbsp;just to clear things up, no I don't cut myself. I found out that the throbbing of my hands felt weird, but good. It didn't really hurt. Maybe that's what cutting myself will feel like, but I'm not dumb enough to do it. Punching walls will give me a few scrapes and bruises, but cutting myself will lead to blood loss, and possibly death. I want to live thank you very much. But I do really want to fight. I was watching some kick boxing for women and men. I wish the girls weren't so padded up. It's like a baby fight compared to the men. If you're afraid to get hurt, then don't fight. Don't make it so that now any girl that wants to fight has to be watered down. Well once Thomas is actually working he's going to pay so that I can go to a training gym and just spar bare with him. <br /><br />Right back to topic. So later he messages me to talk. So I call him and let him talk. He made excuses, as always, then finally stopped and apologized. I told him about the punching and he apologized even more. The was only one person that could make him do that, his brother. He hated it, and now he hated that he was the cause of me doing it. When ever I got quiet he would apologize for being an idiot.&nbsp; He told me that he was mad. That surprised me. <br /><br />See Thomas gets really jerky online. I don't know why, but he loses patience fast, and when he gets mad, he stops all thinking and just goes to attack mode. It's one of the main reasons we use to fight about everyday. I do it too, but I keep more control.&nbsp; So we came up with a solution.&nbsp; When ever he gives a hint of getting jerky, I'd tell him to take five, so that he can just think for five minutes before saying anything stupid. Likewise to me, if I'm about to get bitchy. Well while we were&nbsp;arguing &nbsp;about the leaving thing he told me to take five and that I was acting weird or something. I refused because I wasn't even yelling yet and I wanted to finish what I&nbsp;was saying. He told me later that he was the one that need to take five, but he never said it, so I never knew. <br /><br />That take five thing works wonders though. We went from fighting more than once a day to maybe once a week or less. Well we don't really <em>fight</em>. Our arguments are&nbsp;definitely better than before. It is hard though. When we get mad, we're like a caged tiger that just wants to attack, and being told to stop talking for a while just agitates you more. But we know we have to.<br />&nbsp;<br />Heh, Thomas is horrible at apologizing, but he did pretty good yesterday. I could tell he wished he could take it back but eh, everyone makes mistakes. I mean, I did break up with the guy a while back and I didn't even try to fix the problem with him. I just saw in my eyes it wasn't going to work. But everything happens for a reason, and I wouldn't take it back. Those days made me realize a lot. THough I did tell Thomas yesterday if he plays cry wolf with the whole break&nbsp; up thing I might come back. <br /><br />I really do want to fight though. It would be fun as hell to get into something like in that movie Fight Club. I want someone to really fight me.</lj-cut>"

Thomas talked to his recruiter, nice lady, and they scheduled him to be quick shipped off on May 30th. Perfect timing so that we can spend that week together in Brian's place.

Karen and Karina were the only two I came up with that I would call the best friend. But as you know, Karen is out of the picture. Ever since Karina moved to Colorado about five years ago, we've talked less.&nbsp; Actually, having Karina as the maid of honor would be pretty nice. Heh. It's funny.

At first I had doubts when Brian talked to me about not knowing what else is out there. But I realized than I do. There have been other guys, they just were never good enough to make the &quot;boyfriend&quot; status. Yea he's got a real dark, jerky side. But the more we talk about it, the smaller that side of him becomes. Brian told me I may love him, but I'm not &quot;in love&quot; like he is with my mom. When he first saw her he knew he had to be with her. Well me and Thomas aren't a normal couple anyway. I didn't know what he looked like when I met him. There was only a picture of a mask on his site thinger-ma-bob. Hehe, my mom would so disapprove if she knew. Oh well. I don't know if I did see him I would have the same reaction as Brian did, but I do know when I met him I immediately wished he was in Miami and mine. I remember when he would ask me for advice about trying to get with his stalker, inside I was saying &quot;forget her, get with me&quot;&nbsp; -___-<br /><br />Another thing, Brian liked having fun and just going out with a bunch of girls, I'm not like that. If I'm getting with someone, I have the intention of being with them forever, not sex and goodbye. Well that week is the last time I'll see Thomas before he goes to boot camp. I'm going to have to drag him to the car, he's horrible at saying goodbye. I finally passed my driving test, yay. Now all I need is that damn car and I'll be set. I wanted a Dodge Neon, but I looked them up, and I can get a Mercedes that has more features, more power, and will last longer about $100 more or so. Thomas has a 1989 Mercedes, its pretty nice for a 20 year old car, except hes got broken switches inside, but still, I'd take it. He offered me his car while hes in boot camp. I know it would save me money, but I declined. I really don't like being dependent, and it will be nice to know that I got a car by myself with my hard work. Stupid, maybe. But at least I can fend for myself. I refuse to be like my mom that can't do anything herself and always needs to have things handed to her.<br /><br />But the Mercedes Thomas has is the one I want. Though I might get a 1999 for another $100 more. I want and need something that's going to last a long time. Payday Friday, I can't wait.</lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It's nice, but I hope my sister's little intervention lasts and isn't some kind of &quot;in the moment&quot; thing. I already started training, tomorrow I have to be there at 6:30 a.m. (&gt;_&lt;) Why did there have to be a hostess meeting on the same day as a general employee meeting AND my day of training. Well at least I have an easy job and I'll be starting out around 8$ or 9$. Very nice, I thought I was going to get minimum wage. I only get two shifts in a week, part time. But they said after a month of working I'll have a hang on things and will be able to pick up other shifts.&nbsp; (^_^)

Thomas is doing quick ship for Air Force so he's probably off to boot camp at the end of April. His brother stole his hard drive and he doesn't trust his family with all his stuff so he's leaving everything in my place, including his car. Heh, I get a car and a ps3 but I lose my boyfriend for four years. Brutal trade. But, he gets paid vacation so he'll actual get to come see me more than now. I sure hope I get money to buy my own car though, his stinks of fumes and it doesn't like me.&nbsp;

Laundry and dishes are suppose to be something we all do. We all are living here so we all got to do some leg work. I usually wash all the dishes and do all the laundry. My sister will do something once in a blue moon so we can't say she hasn't done anything. Her response to anything we tell her to do is &quot;Why can't you do it.&quot; But on the bright side, once i move out she'll have to do everything by herself. Maybe then she'll grow up a little. She's also got a major attitude, especially to my mom. I know my mom can be a bitch at times but hell she does a lot for us. She shouldn't be treated the way my sister treats her.<br />I went to orientation for Chili's today. I got to say I got lucky for my first job. They got a bunch of different insurance plans, good benefits and the people there are really nice. They also said something about students in college... Got to read on that.

So we've now been together for seven months. It was also his birthday.

But as he said before, break ups are his worse moments and I really love him. We're still having this little problems, but at least its more of a debate than an argument. I'm finally getting a job as a greeter at Chilies (finally). I really need a car, it takes three buses and about two hours to get there and its not even that far from my house. Why can't our public bus system be like California ='(&nbsp; 

Thomas is coming this Friday, and probably just one more time before he does his years in the Air Force and once more if i get to go up there. I'm bummed, but I know he's wanted to be a soldier and I'll be proud of him.
Oh and one more thing,&nbsp; pmsing is super lame. Everything that Thomas says that bothers me is amplified about a hundred times. God damn you period!

Every time you said &quot; we can get over this, please try&quot; it hurt so much to tell you no. Your reaction to me not wanting to try and work it out anymore is exactly why I can't handle you.

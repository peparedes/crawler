It feels so weird. This year went by pretty fast, and so much happened. Is it normal to have an unbelievable urge to play the drums right now?! I would wake up 20 blocks, but it would be quite fun. :)
So, today I basically took my whole roll of film...which was stupid because I had the whole vacation to do it. Hopefully I got some nice shots. I just completely blocked out anything that had to do with school this vacation. I think I'm going to take another roll this week, just because I want to, and because it's fun.
Have a great New Year everyone! Hopefully this week of school won't be as horrible as I'm expecting. And hopefully I'll get a couple of hours of sleep tonight."

I have to study for that english test. I hope I'll do okay. 
Ugh today sucks, I have such a headache but I can't take anything else because I already took something for my lovely cramps. Here comes death week.

I need a hug, and I need sleep.

Oh and I'm pissed off that we can't use calculators for that freaking math quiz tomorrow. Doesn't Fallon know that everyone can't do simple math anymore, like adding and multiplying?! BAH

I'm going to try and sleep early tonight...but I'm still losing sleep because I have jazz in the morning :-(

I really haven't written in here since the summer, wow.
So, these past two weeks have been really sucky for everyone. Everything bad always happens together...which sucks. I'm sorry, for everyone, if things have been shitty for you.

I really miss Luciano. I hope he comes back soon, he told me he really wants to.

I'm having problems sleeping again. I've been going to sleep at like, 2,3,4..I feel like it's right back to last year. Thinking way too much at night.
I have a lot going on in my mind lately
I need to sleep early tonight

Things will get better soon.

Today we tried calling Alitalia to give him a week longer, but they said that his tickets aren't changeable. I really can't deal with him leaving the 8th. I freaking want him to live here. Gah, I can't even talk about this. Oh shit, it's 3:30. I think I'm going to the city tomorrow again. I hope I'm ""up"" for it. I fell off a chair today. This summer, I've become clumsier than I've ever been in my life. This is madness. I have to sleep.
Night

Oh and add Luciano on Myspace...he's too good not to be heard by the public.
There's suppose to be 4 songs, but the first one only seems to be working right now.

Today was the most insane day of my life. I went to Letterman to see the man himself! Johnny Depp. He rescheduled from the end of June when he canceled. Oh my freaking god. it was the most insanely, magical, surreal moment/day of my life.


Me, my mom, britt and jenna got to the show around 12:15...there were probably about 20 people there then....I think by 4:00 there were about 300 people. It was insane. Later on they set up barricades across the street from the side entrance for the crowd...luckily, I got there early enough to get a good spot. I was pretty much right in front of the barricade  So, after waiting about 4 hours, we saw the big black SUV! The paparazzi started snapping away...he posed for them for a little bit when he got out. Then he walked away from the car so he could be seen by the crowd and mouthed something like, ""I'll come back after"" It was about 4:20 when he arrived, and the taping started at 4:30, so he didn't have time to autograph anything then. At that point, I was in shock, it was so surreal. I seriously couldn't believe he was...right there. It was unbelievable. So we waited about another hour until he came back out...I think it was around 5:45....we found out that he was going to basically sign down the line of people...he signed quite a lot.

So he was coming a little closer and this great guy I met, James, let me squeeze into the front. (THANK YOU SO MUCH! and thank you for the extra johnny stuff you gave me after the madness!) The pushing and shoving was crazy, I kept getting pushed into the barricade and he was so close at that point...I had my rolling stone magazine in one hand and my camera in another...i didn't get any good shots because my body was moving like crazy... I had so many emotions at that point. So as he's basically in front of me, I'm trying to really look at him, you know? but I'm being shoved...I almost fell over...so Johnny's body guards were trying to push the people in back of me that were shoving me away..so I could move... it was crazy... they were screaming ""get off of her!! get off!! your hurting her!!"" and so I saw Johnny trying to find what I was holding so he could sign it...it was so great, he like, tracked my arm to my magazine with the sharpie....so he signed it and looked at me and said ""you okay!?"" and after hearing that lovely voice of his, I said ""yea I'm okay"" and he smiled and moved along. It was so touching. After that I just couldn't hold it in anymore and I broke down into tears. I mean..how could you not cry after having a 5 second conversation with Johnny Depp...I had freaking eye contact with him. oh my fucking god.

so, his body guards moved him very quickly along the line, I didn't even get to say thank you. But it's okay. I seriously am a happier person now. This man does something to me. I know I'm insane...but I just can't help it.

so amazing. I can't even explain.

So, he went down the line of fans and I think someone tried to take his jacket off, so he wound up taking it off...great moment as well! 

I loved what he was wearing! And he didn't wear his hat! I was so happy I got to see his full head of hair! LOL! He really is so beautiful! I didn't think he could be any more beautiful than the pictures I see every day, but in person he is just so much more. Oh man, it really was the experience of my life. He finished signing and he quickly got into the car and waved through the open window.  

5 hours of waiting in the dead heat... and about 7 hours of standing and walking was all worth it in the end....obviously 

 

here are some pics...they didn't turn out great, but it's better than nothing! I have a video but I have to upload it...

a great glimpse of the man!

oh! and it was so nice to meet everyone I was standing with! thank you for being so cool! :o)


so lets see....almost 4 years of...umm...obbsession and research and interviews and movies and everything. It was so fucking amazing. I still can't believe it. I am truly on cloud 9. I need some time to really process this whole day. holy shit

"event","I finally got my thoughts together for Dead Man's Chest...If anyone cares to read it, go right ahead....DO NOT READ IF YOU DIDN'T SEE IT! IT WILL SPOIL THE MOVIE!


<lj-cut text=""'ello beastie"">
Okay. So, I absolutely loved it. It was the same great fun feeling that I got when I watched the first movie. I can say that I probably liked the first one better, because it was such a surprise, but this one still blew me away. 
So, Jack's entrance was awesome once again. I honestly didn't think they'd come close to the first, but it was priceless...poor crow. I actually wish there was more Jack in this film. Jack's character went a lot deeper in this one. At first it felt like he was almost not in character. He became this sort of coward...but really he is still the same old Jack Sparrow that puts himself before others but is still a loveable guy. When he left the Pearl to be completely destroyed by the kraken, his somewhat heroic side and his true love for the Black Pearl made him realize that he can't just leave his ship.
Elizabeth has reaaaally grown up in this one. She is very interesting. She still pisses the hell outta me for basically killing Jack, but, I really loved their scenes together. Oh my freaking god. The scenes with Jack and Elizabeth were so good. They have such good chemistry! And that kiss, oh my god, that was extremely sexy...even if it was a kiss of death. Elizabeth really was curious. She is very drawn and attracted to Jack, but I still think that her and Will are the best together. It will be really interesting to see where their relationship will go after the whole tounging with Jack.
Oh man, Davy Jones was awesome. He was a creeper though. lol. And I loved boostrap! He was so great! I really feel bad for him though :-( And Norrington got hot! wow! What a great character too! He went from commodore to a drunken scruff. 
The ending with Barbossa. I totally called that. Freakin' yes. I love barbossa. I actually missed him in this movie. lol. That damn apple.
So, Elizabeth and Jack kiss and then Elizabeth cuffs Jack to the pearl, I went insane. I cried so hard. It was so hard to watch Jack die. He came in with two brilliant entrances and then he finished...well not reaaaallly....but finished with an insanely amazing exit. Freaking eh. Jack Sparrow is the shit. Best movie character like...ever.
Other than all that, I felt that the humor was good, but not as good as the first. But still, there are so many good one-liners and jokes that you just have to love. And again, I wish there was more Jack. Also, there were so many quotes that I was waiting to hear, and they weren't there! They cut out so much! I can't wait for the DVD!!!!!! But there really were so many good lines...even some emotional ones :'(

So I saw it twice already, it was better the second time because there was so much going on. So, go see it again. I plan on it :-) 
Congrats to the cast and crew of pirates! It made fucking 55.5 million opening day!! That's the biggest opening ever! And they're expecting 132 million for the whole weekend!! INSANE

love you johnnyyyy


ready for PIRATES 3!?!?!? :-D

"event","Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant, while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet? What's so great about Caesar? Hm? Brutus is just as cute as Caesar. Brutus is just as smart as Caesar. People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar. And when did it become okay for one person to be the boss of everybody, huh? Because that's not what Rome is about. We should totally just *STAB* Caesar!

...ms marks gives a priceless look....'twas a classic...

Ms Marks- ""maybe you should take your own advice""

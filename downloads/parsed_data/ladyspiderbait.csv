he's disgusting and slimy and maipulative. he's completely insecure and selfish. and i honestly don't think he knows how to be a good boyfriend. 
i don't think i can hang out with him anyomre... i don't know how she lets him do this o her. you should NOT be fighting after 5 months about the same things you were fighting about after 2. it's just NOT meant to be. he's a head case. and he's going to hurt her. and then I'll have to kill him."

Next time go by yourselves. And now talking about how yard sale.money can help buy his helmet. WTF. Cause you have a few things at home to sell? May I remind you that you basically live there rent free? Meg he's walking all over you. You give him too much and he's pretty useless. If she wasn't looking for a job for him would he be?

i just don't know why i get myself involved with boys i don't think i can actually see myself with. i'll just end up hurting him... i wanted to give it a try though... a beta male if you will.. because apparently i clash too much with the alphas... but ive come to the conclusion that the betas are just BORING! where's the excitement? the adventure? the cocky attitude? the ""i can whisk you away and you're going to like it"" demeanor? I want the unpredictable actions and ambitions that i come to expect from myself. 
and i need a bit of fire... and oddly enough its HIS end it isnt coming from. not since marco have i felt so undesireable lol. he won't even touch me. i'd say its affecting my ego, but i just feel like he's intimidated. And that, on top of everythign else is a huge turn off. I realize that yes, I am a little more experienced than most.. but when its that obvious its almost a teachign session to the point where it isnt enjoyable anymore. Maybe i should give him the benefit of the doubt... but then that leaves room for disappointment... and is this even what i want? why would i add another name to a list that im not even sure i want there?

honestly, being single was so much simpler."

And I try SO hard to like him but then he does stupid shit like tonight and she gets all upset and quiet, and that makes me angry that he can hurt her so bad with somethign so trivial.These things shouldnt matter to him!! 
And like, I HATE having to tip toe around matt. he's not even my boyfriend and i feel like i have to watch everythign i say around him so he doesn't get offended. Like, guys names can't be mentionned because apparently guys and girls can't just be friends.... Circle K can't be mentionned because its drama... its like i can't even tell meg about my day anymore because the SLIGHTEST thing will piss him off, and then she'll get all upset when she sure as fuck doesnt need that.

i did the worst i could possibly do last semester and even got an email that warned me about academic probation. i have no job and thus no money. and to make me feel a little worse about myself, lets just throw in the fact that I've become the 5th wheel in my own house. 
and i know that i presented the image that this is what i want to do... but i really miss him. like heart ache miss him. and i wonder if its love or loneliness, but the longer its been the worse i feel. hes not a bad person, and he does have the best intentions no matter what everyone says about him. but its so hard to defend something for so long and only get negative responses. the only time i ever got agreement is when i had a complaint. i know he's not perfect, but who is? maybe hes what i need to keep the fire and balance me out. maybe... not...? i dont know. im so confused.

Speaking of work, Gail and Christina Emery should die horrible horrible deaths. Basically, I've been shunned from recieving any shifts up in MDU. When asked why I was told I was the model employee; efficient, trained, liked by all the case managers; they just didn't want me up there anymore. Excuse you? I'm sorry, the only reasoning I can figure from that is christina, with her infinitly large head, doesn't like me. blame it on jealousy, or her newfound lesbian affair with Julie... either way, its cost me my full time cushy summer job. Fuck the politics in this place man. I have to run my own business. I can't stand the way people get promoted due to age and not ability. I wouldn't stand for it. And i MOST CERTAINLY would never stand for the blatant misuse of managerial power gail demonstrated. Not only was it incredibly low, but the mere fact that she told everyone else BUT me I was being denied shifts?? Completely unacceptable. I would have fired her on the spot. She's just lucky she doesn't HAVE a superior right now, otherwise I'd be writing a lengthy letter."

What a waste of hospital money. But then again, they're quite good at doing that.

Speaking of finances, I was grossly disturbed to find out that Trent is no longer offering bursaries to students who do not receive OSAP. This leaves me incredibly confused. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but should bursaries not be awarded based on grades and NOT on the source your tuition comes from? Just because the governement isn't loaning me money, doesn't mean that I have to pay any less than anyone else. Not only is the money still coming out of my own pocket, but I had to work my ass off over the summer AND get a part time job during the school year to compensate for the fact that I couldn't save anythign, yet OSAP provides money based on cost of living expenses. What makes the situation even MORE frustrating is that it is a known fact that OSAP gives the student plenty, and the majority of them drink it away. They reffer to it as their ""beer money cheques."" So what makes a student who is technically doing everything they're supposed to do to make it through university on a budget, any less eligible?
Trent is Fucked Up man...

Instead of calling IS and dealing with it, he's like, well maybe its cause you were on MSN, and when i told him no, i didnt install anything it was a WEB MESSENGER, he kept going on about installing software.

He's great. He's so pretty and easy to talk to... and kisses SO good. I swear though, if we had anythign else in common we'd be the same person...  he's just too perfect for me... but doesn't want a relationship. I dont know WHO left him fucked, but she did a damn good job of it. But like, i dont want to have to CONVINCE him to date me. I don't know why he doesn't just WANT to. 
And yes, I know, I don't even live here... if we WERE to date, there's that distance thing, as Meg's always SO quick to remind me. But quite frankly, I don't care. The distance doesn't bother me at all.
It's just him thats the obstacle...

I will be even more bored than i usually am. *grumble grumble* So unhappy about this. BUT we're hanging out again this weekend... and practically every weekend until the end of the summer... so I shouldn't complain too badly. 
I'm debating taking Friday off as well..... but I already had to take Monday off due to doctors appointments... so I guess thats good enough.

I had quite a boring Canada day this year though. It's so unfair that it fell on a Tuesday and everyone had to work the monday before.... Last year was so much fun, and Marco came down and all that good stuff.. this year was super lame. 
And like, my mom's like, WE can go downtown! but could she be any lamer? Like tahts EXACTLY what i want to do! Run into people downtown like Julia and reinforce the fact that I have no friends. Sweet. Oh and Dan is like, lets go see Sean Paul together! But once again.... hanging out with a 50 yr old when Julia will most definitely be there with Lisa and Deanna and everyone we went with last year is sooo not cool. 
Ew. I hate the fact that she's destroyed my summer so easily. I'm definitely not coming back to ottawa next summer.... I couldn't survive. 

3 more days and then i get a semi-vacation!! sooon.... I'm going to paint my place in ptbo so that should be fun.

"event","Ugh. I dont think its even possible for Julia (aka dirty homeless person) and christina to piss me off even more. They've been training honestly FOREVER, and the dumb bitch STILL doesn't know how to do anything. The two of them together is quite possibly the worst combination of life. Not only do they spend the entire time just chatting and gossiping, Christina's bad habits are rubbing off on her... for example, the incredibly long breaks. And NOTHING gets done, and then I get to play catch up the next time I'm in whatever area she was just trained in. HONESTLY. It's been OVER A WEEK and she still hasn't even been taught how to do a billing sheet. Like WTF are you guys doing up there????? And OMG don't even get me STARTED on christina. I DONT CARE that she's their golden girl. She's an IDIOT. LAst Monday and Tuesday she couldn't possibly train Julie because she was given the task of shutting down rooms and rebooking appointments as per dr. klaassen's vacation schedule. WELL TODAY bitch hands me a stack of papers that she ""never got around to"" from Klaassen's clinic. Like, seriously? You had TWO FUCKING DAYS to rebook 10 clinics.... Yet for some reason... you handed THREE of those clinic lists to ME this morning, which I somehow managed to finish in under an hour. SO WHAT PREY TELL WERE YOU DOING FOR TWO DAYS IN THE BACK?!?!?! PLAYING WITH YOURSELF?!?!?!? 
Like, I don't know what to say or do, because as I've frustratingly expressed before, I'm NOTHIGN here and my opinion is less than irrelevant. But this STRESSES me out and PISSES me off. And thats NOT the kind of mood I want to be in when I come to work every morning. GRRR.

draft for gail:

Dear Gail, 
 
I'm writing to you because I am so incredibly frustrated with certain secretaries on this floor that I felt I needed to share some of my complaints and concerns with you, seeing as no one has any issue complaining about me. 
 
I understand completely that Julie is new and that she will need some time to catch on, no one is perfect right away, but I feel like not only is she NOT making the effort to pick things up quickly, she's picked up some of the bad habits of the individual who has been training her. She leaves things half done instead of asking for help when she is unsure how to do something, she takes many, long breaks, and she believes socializing is more important than completing the basic tasks assigned to that position.
Even as we speak they are having a wonderful time giggling over a joke involving Dr. Al-Harbi and myself, which i personally find incredibly offensive.
 
Now normally I wouldn't CARE that people are social, heck, everyone up here is social and chatty. We're all women, it's more than expected. But if all this socializing is preventing her from being trained (as Christina is VERY guilty of this herself) then I don't think its acceptable. ESPECIALLY when it results in me doing extra work. For example, Christina has supposedly been training Julie in the front for 2 weeks, yet I've done the billings almost every night, as somehow she hasn't been taught this yet. 
As well, today Christina gave me a list of clinics to rebook even though those clinics were SUPPOSEDLY the reason she couldn't train Julie last monday and tuesday. I was able to rebook those clinics in less than an hour. 
 
I'm upset because I feel that I am unfairly complained about, even though I accomplish much more in the same amount of time as anyone else, and that individuals such as Christina and Julie aren't, due solely to who they are and their seniority."

I think this means I'm starting to be okay with this whole being single and independant thing! Like, i DONT need him. And I'll be sooo much happier when I find someone I'm attracted to on ALL levels instead of just physically. 
Ugh! He's so persistent though! But he's so UN-like me.... he loves country (yuck), working out, and... his car? lol honestly tahts ALL he talks about.. i know I'm being stereotypical, but still. OH and he talks about how much he LOVES the southern U.S. EWWWW. i'm SO anti-american, ESPECIALLY anti-southern republican. I mean, the ONLY places I'd be interested in living is like L.A. or New York... and he's like no, I like Texas, New York is overrated. Ew texas. Ew his taste in general!!!

I don't know how people survive making minimum wage... i make so much more than that and i STILL am scrounging the few days before i get paid again. It's a sad sad feeling. Oh and I got a 1300$ tax refund.. but NONE of it is mine. So not fair. But I guess I was kind of a mooch all school year. Whatever, next year I'll get a job selling shots at the trash or something lol. 

So I got my hair permed last wednesday after work, and while she was doing it i could feel the back of my neck getting very wet and almost burning. So i TOLD her and she said that it was only because my hair was wet and that it was nothing. Well Friday night i went to Belleville and as I was putting my hair up in a ponytail for the first time since the perm, Meg noticed a huuuuuuge burn on the back of my neck. So APPARENTLY the goddamn bitch who was telling me it was just water was WRONG, and now I have this huge chemical burn on the back of my neck that will most definitely leave a gruesome scar. I'm SO PISSED. And  to make me even ANGRIER, I've been trying to get ahold of the salon for the past 3 days to tell them off, and when I finally DID get ahold of them today the manager kindly said to me, ""well how do we know you got it here and not in the sun?""
WTF BUDDY! The sun burnt me in a conveniently shaped ring around my hairline and ONLY there. Fucking Dumbasses. So now I get to head over there after work and bitch some people out. Ugh. And like, i could just let it go, but I paid 150$ for a perm that will last 3 months, and a scar that will last a lifetime. Thats what really gets to me. 

Today is just an icky, crappy day. Eveyday is an icky, crappy day lately. I know I'm pms-ing right now, but i really just feel incredibly sad and  unhappy with my life. I'm SO lonely its disgusting. And I hate my job. A lot. Like what is even going on this summer? It's like painful torture. And all I do is cry. Every single day. And i have no idea how i can fix this or make things better. Meg says I dont always have to fix things, and sometimes I should just let myself be sad... but if its a constant depression I can't just let it happen to me.  
Somedays I'm convinced i belong on a psych ward somewhere in a room with lovely padded walls."

Cars and muscles just aren't doing it for me. Maybe I need a tortured artistic soul. Someone deep and meaningful... not someone who talks about meal plans and spring break tours. 
And you know what? He doesn't even seem taht interested.. so I dont feel bad about this at all. Boy hasn't even tried to kiss me... except that first night when i was drunk. Like wtf man. I want someone to want me. and he does not.
Yet he just texted me and asked to see me again. what is WITH him? 
Ugh. Life. 

And work is just TOTALLY boring me. Nothing new, no challenge... just the same thing day after day... I'm so bored with making charts and plastics! I need somethign new, exciting... worthy of my intelligence! But I'm young and casual... i shouldn't expect anything from this place. Just suck it up and wait for the summer to be over i guess... 
And we all know its going to be a LONG summer.... especially now that i dont think shawn and I are friends anymore. Whatever. He chose Julia over me. I'll get over it. I'm just so offended that he NEVER made plans with me, yet he chills with her every weekend... Like, i thought i was the one he wanted but i was obviously misinformed. AND THEN he gives me a hard time about dating anthony. Well excuse you. I believe i originally had plans with YOU last saturday and you ended up in cornwall.. THATS why i went on that first date. And we argued MONDAY. It is now Thursday and I haven't heard from him.
Totally Over It. Not Worth My Time.

Whatever... things have to suck sometimes. I just wish that things would go right for me a little more often... 

On the plus side though, I got the most fabulous perm! I'm rockin the white-girl fro today. Im loving it. i think it suits my personality and its nice and easy for the summer. 
And I'm going up to Belleville tomorrow after work, so at least I'll have fun this weekend...  Just gotta keep thinking positive through the weekdays, right?"

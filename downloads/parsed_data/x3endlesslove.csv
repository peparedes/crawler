<P>so July 5th i slept over krystal's and my mom calls and she's like ""we're going to niagara falls in the morning"" wtf?i was like dying of laughter bc it was just so last minute.i really wanted someone to come with me so my dad already called my uncle to see if renee can come but no one was answering the phone, so i asked krystal to come but she couldnt:( then we finally got in touch w/renee and she came with us:) thank god bc i would have like died on the car ride there/back (8 hours each) it really wasn't that bad though because we have a dvd player in the car and we all agreed on movies to watch and i slept some of the time.</P>
<P>i dont remember what time we got there?but we unpacked our stuff and ate dinner and walked around outside the hotel (which you can see the falls right outside our window!)</P>
<P>the next day we went on this 4 1/2 hour tour around the falls and to different places. we stopped at this place with like 2,000 butterflies inside &nbsp;and we went on the maid of the mist (a boat) and it took us like right by the falls and we all got wet but they gave us ponchos lol.</P>
<P>the next day we had to check out at like 12 so we got our stuff together, checked out, ate lunch and left:( i want to go back!!</P>

"event","<P>so, friday was my sweet 16.it was awesome :) i was kinda pissed before it because the day before liek 5 ppl told me they couldn't make it and my parents already payed, some of them had good reasons but others had their own stupid reasons which im not going to get into bc its stupid.but i had a great time anyway and i wasnt even thinking about it because the people i wanted there, were there.of course i would've liked it if the other people were there but whatever.i stayed home from school friday bc i have a cold and i wanted to get better(which didnt happen, still sick) but i went out with my mom to get the favors,balloons and stuff.then when i got home i wanted to take a nap but i remembered i had to finish my speeches so i never got a chance to take a nap, i still had like 3 to do, and i was getting my hair done at 3:30.after i was done getting my hair done, my mom took me to target to get pics taken and they came out so good.of course i looked liek an idiot walking into target with my dress on but whatever. came home,did some last minute getting ready and left.a few mins after we got there, kevin got there(which i was suprised bc he said he wasnt comming till 8 )but being early is better than being late lol.then ppl started showing up and the party began.after, christina slept over.and we had to drive kevin &amp; amanda home and kevin was being retarded and asking how they came up with town's names lol it was funny.</P>
<P>saturday-we didn't really do anything, we played DDR, and i havent played it in like a million years but im not that bad.idk what else, then we went out to dinner with my family and my 2 uncles &amp; grandma bc my uncle and grandma were going back to my uncle's house in florida.we went to bed at like 9:30</P>
<P>sunday-we went to the mall and i got the pocketbook i wanted:),2 pairs of jeans,a shirt, and MY CONVERSES&lt;3333333.i spent like around $200..probably more.then we drove christina home and my cousins came over later.</P>
<P>today i went back to the mall with ashley and i got 2 skirts and 3 shirts.i wanted to go to old navy and get flip flops to match the skirts but my mom said we'll go tomorrow :(</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>k well im going to bed.goodnight &lt;3</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>p.s.- i hate snow and i want it to melt so i can wear my skirts &amp; flipflops,and i want it to be spring &lt;3</P>"

"event","so i updated about a second ago but decided to delete it because some people might get mad even though it's the truth and its my feelings but i really don't feel like starting with people. let's just say, do what you want and don't ask me if you're not going to listen.

this week is going slow.today feels liek wednesday. i wish it was because i would be babysitting right now and making money that i need. but no, its tuesday. i hate the snow and of course as soon as it decides to start to melt, we're expecting more.i went tanning and im still pale.i wanna go again but my mom refuses to give me money to go tanning so it looks like i have to either go tomorrow after i get done babysitting or thursday after school?if we have school.whatever this entry was pointless."

<P><FONT size=2>Sally jumped up as soon as she saw the surgeon come out of the operating room.<BR><BR><BR>She said: ""How is my little boy? Is he going to be all right? When can I see him?""<BR><BR><BR>The surgeon said, ""I'm sorry. We did all we could, but your boy didn't make it.""<BR><BR><BR>Sally said, ""Why do little children get cancer? Doesn't God care anymore? Where were you, God, when my son needed you?""<BR><BR><BR>The surgeon asked, ""Would you like some time alone with your son? One of the nurses will be out in a few minutes, before he's transported to the University.""<BR><BR><BR>Sally asked the nurse to stay with her while she said good-bye to her son. She ran her fingers lovingly through his thick red curly hair.<BR><BR><BR>""Would you like a lock of his hair?"" the nurse asked.<BR><BR><BR>Sally nodded yes. The nurse cut a lock of the boy's hair, put it in a plastic bag and handed it to Sally.<BR><BR><BR>The mother said, ""It was Jimmy's idea to donate his body to the University for study. He said it might help somebody else.<BR><BR><BR>""I said no at first, but Jimmy said, ""Mom, I won't be using it after I die. Maybe it will help some other little boy spend one more day with his Mom."" She went on, ""My Jimmy had a heart of gold. Always thinking of someone else. Always wanting to help others if he could.""<BR><BR><BR>Sally walked out of Children's Mercy Hospital for the last time, after spending most of the last six months there. She put the bag with Jimmy's belongings on the seat beside her in the car. The drive home was difficult. It was even harder to enter the empty house. She carried Jimmy's belongings, and the plastic bag with the lock of his hair to her son's room She started placing the model cars and other personal things, back in his room exactly where he had always kept them. She laid down across his bed and, hugging his pillow, cried herself to sleep. It was around midnight when Sally awoke. Lying beside her on the bed was a folded letter.<BR><BR><BR>The letter said:<BR><BR><BR>Dear Mom:<BR>I know you're going to miss me; but don't think that I will ever forget you, or stop loving you, just 'cause I'm not around to say I LOVE YOU. I will always love you, Mom, even more with each day. Someday we will see each other again. Until then, if you want to adopt a little boy so you won't be so lonely, that's okay with me. He can have my room, and old stuff to play with. But, if you decide to get a girl instead, she probably wouldn't like the same things us boys do. You'll have to buy her dolls and stuff girls like, you know. Don't be sad thinking about me. This really is a neat place. Grandma and Grandpa met me as soon as I got here and showed me around some, but it will take a long time to see everything. The angels are so cool. I love to watch them fly. And, you know what? Jesus doesn't look like any of his pictures. Yet, when I saw him, I knew it was Him. And guess what, Mom? I got to sit on God's knee and talk to Him, like I was somebody important. That's when I told Him that I wanted to write you a letter, to tell you good-bye and everything. But I already knew that wasn't allowed. Well, you know what Mom? God handed me some paper and His own personal pen to write you this letter. I think Gabriel is the name of the angel who is going to drop this letter off to you. God said for me to give you the answer to one of the questions you asked Him? ""Where was He when I needed him?"" God said, He was in the same place with me, as when His son Jesus was on the cross. He was right there, as He always is with all His children.<BR>Oh, by the way, Mom, no one else can see what I've written except you. To everyone else this is just a blank piece of paper. Isn't that cool? I have to give God His pen back now. He needs it to write some more names in the Book of Life. Tonight I get to sit at the table with Jesus for supper. I'm sure the food will be great. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, I don't hurt anymore. The cancer is all gone. I'm glad because I couldn't stand that pain anymore ... and God couldn't stand to see me hurt so much, either. That's when He sent The Angel of Mercy to come get me. The Angel said I was Special Delivery! How about that?<BR>Signed with Love from:<BR>God, Jesus &amp; Me.</FONT></P>"

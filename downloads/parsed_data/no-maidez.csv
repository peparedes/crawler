"event","here's another really late (or really early) post. we're driving throughout the night tonight. i hate when we do this. :o/ considering the fact that my dad is a truck driver, you'd think that we knew stuff about the 'business' or 'trucks' but no... i don't know anything. my dad does whatever he does while roob and i just assume it's the way things are supposed to go... and don't ask questions. ABOUT ANYTHING. haha it's worked out well for all of us so far! 

i miss my bed. i can't wait to get home. traveling is fun, but normally we are in crappy ass towns that have nothing to do. so dad is up front, me and roob back here, he's listening to sigur ros on his computer. he is such an artsy fuck. he really appreciates this stuff, he will listen to that album over and over agian and really enjoy it. then he has the ability to climb up with my dad and fucking sing tom petty. he's... well he really makes me jealous sometimes! but there is no way i'd ever let him know that... i'm glad to have this journal.

my favorite band is the sneaker pimps, i love that kind of music, i love techoish stuff. i like skindive alot and i love crystal method. if anybody knows any bands like these that i might not have heard of please share! roob likes these really 'talented' people like... sigur ros for example. i just don't GET their music, it's nice to fall asleep to... he likes the bands yo la tengo and broken social scene. who all have really interesting kinda... pussy like sounds. i mean they are just really light and fluffy. i can't lie and say i don't kind of like them too though...

what kind of music do you all like?"

"event","tonight is alot like last night, except we are in the hoosier state! this is where my dad is originally from so he called up some of his friends and he will be with them all night probably. this motel has a fucking pool, it's rad. me and roooobin don't have any swimsuits though... so we will probably wait until like 2 am and go skinny dipping. pool vs. shower. whats the best way to get clean? 

this place also has a fucking vcr, it's quite awesome, we are about to walk down the street to a blockbuster we saw and rent pulp fiction. maybe we'll smoke some weed too... wow summer rocks, but i am missing mom so it'll be okay when we get back to ca.

robin is reciting a poem by robert frost haha."

"event","hey, good morning. i have 6 'mutual friends' on livejournal! and i have one that i added cause they asked me too but they didn't add me back... what should i do? should i just leave them or say something to them maybe? i'm not new to the internet but to livejournal i still don't know exactly what i'm doing.

and where do all of you get such cool looking icons? i want to make mine look better, they are so plain. anyways, we just got done eating lunch at this diner you might call it, just me dad and robin. i always love the summer cause it's just us and we are never in one place long enough to really meet anyone so we can really just be ourselves, we don't have to worry about impressing girls or anything like that.

so when school starts back up i'm always pretty nostalgic to the road and my dad, and at our mom's house me and robin have seperate rooms so that seems kinda weird at first, alot of the time one of us will just sleep on the floor of the others room until we can't stand the fucking floor anymore and then we will switch and then finally we will just sleep in our own rooms.

right now i'm sitting in the tiny ass little cabin on the small little mattress while dad and robin are up front singing along to some old song, i think it's tom petty! haha i love tom petty. the internet is such an awesome thing to have at a time like this, when you are such a little bit sick of singing along to tom petty for 59020948038401934 miles, you've exhausted all the 'road games' a million times over, and you can't read for very long or you'll get car sick.

this journal will probably a good place to tell stories about what happens and what has happened to me on the road... or otherwise i guess, there is alot of stuff i keep crammed in my head and it would be nice to get it out so i can be sure i'll never forget it too."

"event","in ohio tonight, at a motel. dad isn't in, i'm on one bed, typing up this journal entry obviously and robin is on the other one playing on his laptop too, i'm glad we don't share a computer, i don't want him to find out about my livejournal. saturday night live is on but neither of us is watching it i don't think.

dad probably won't come home tonight, alot of the time when we stay in motels he will be up all night at a bar meeting some women or something, i'm not sure, he always trys to avoid talking about it when we ask him but it doesn't really matter. i know i sure as hell think it's cool having a motel room all to ourselves! if i had a penny for every night that me and robin stayed up all night getting high alone in one of these motel rooms... well, i'd probably have a dollar at least. haha, you should all be so lucky!

i have a ton of pictures on this computer, most are really crappy but i'd like to put some on here, can somebody tell me how i could do that? sorry... i like computers and i know more than most about them i guess... but i don't know this haha so any help would be awesome...?

oh and p.s. i have TWO livejournal friends haha this is awesome"

"event","um... hey, this is my livejournal. i've seen these before... and just finally decided to get one cause i want something that nobody i know knows about so that i can say whatever the fuck i want without them thinking i'm some pussy or something.

my name isn't really dinner, that's just what everybody calls me. i'm 17 and my real name is ricky. i dunno who decided to start calling me dinner but that's what everybody calls me. if you wanna learn some of the stuff i like then you can look at my intrests that are in my info. 

um... what else is there to know about me? well... i'm from a lot of places. my parents are divorced, my mom lives in san fran, CA and that is where me and my twin brother live during the school year but during the summer we tag along with our dad who doesn't really live anywhere. he is a truck driver and we spend some nights crammed in the little cabin in the huge truck but most of the time we get a motel room because my dad is a respected guy at his company.

sometimes me and robin have to share a bed in the motel room but a lot of the time dad will stay out all night and we will eat pizza and watch tv then sleep on the road the next day. my dad is used to never sleeping. robin is my twin brother by the way... 

we aren't back in san fran yet because school won't start until august something but my dad bought me and robin these wireless internet cards for our laptops so that we can get the internet anywhere, even when we are on the road, it probably costs alot of money. 

i thought i could just use this journal to talk about shit that happens to me."

"event","Back by 4 peoples popular demand, my life!  Um, nothing really is happening now...I'm happy now, which is good because it's rather unusual  that I'm happy when I get relatively good grades. It's mostly because of Alissa. I know this is the first time ya'll have heard of her, but shes a friend in Illinois. The only reason I didn't mention her was because of her ex boyfriend. She basically went through what Emilie did, but I don't want to go into it with-out her consent. Anyways, she just wanted to keep me a secret until she told him about me. Anyways, yeah, I just enjoy talking to her...alot... I stay up late at night doing so. Like last night, I told myself I would get to sleep early, I had planned on 10 P.M. And then I started talking to Alissa, and next thing I knew, it was 10:30, I said ""Ok, thats ok, still 6.5 hours."" But next thing I know, we're talking on the phone again, and it's after mid-night. Oh my, is her voice ever so beautiful...she is an amazing woman. I wish I could elaborate...But yeah, talking to her has been the reason I've been happy, and me being happy is actually helping my grades, because it's a different kind of happy, and my grades are MUCH better than last year. And this marking period will be better as well...I hope. Anyways, I have a second job now too, and it's helping to pull me out of my rut and helping to pay for an airplane ticket to Moline, Illinois, to visit my good friend, if anyone wants to chip into the fund.... But, I do feel bad about one thing, I promised the dear Jackie Waymire that I would help with Blues tribute, but I havn't been to the practices...and I lost the rehersal schedual, and yeah...hint hint. My car is working relatively good, minus the oil leak, which I'm getting several quotes about soon, which is another fund you may contribute to, if you feel so inclined. Wow, long post huh? Um, yeah, my life! Anything else ya'll want to know....seriously...?"

I wasn't very indiscreet and yet
That is a notion that I might as well forget
Friends look at me these days with fond surprise
But when I start to speak they roll their eyes

Let me tell you about her
Hush now, I've said too much
There's something indescribable I can't quite catch
Let me tell you about her
The way that she makes me feel
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal

Some things are too personal
Too intimate to spill
And gentlemen don't speak of them
And this one never will

I wasn't very conversational
Eccept to say that, ""You're sensational""
Friends now regard me with indulgent smiles
But when I start to sing they run for miles

Let me tell you about her
Hush now, I've said too much
There's something indescribable I can't quite catch
Let me tell you about her
The way that she makes me feel
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal


Lately I have found myself quite happy, and I know why too . The *noun* that makes me happy knows what it is too. 
I just like the song, by the way. Anyways, yeah, things are getting better, and for the next couple of weeks I will be un-hooking my internet, 
to make sure I do the things I need to, so I won't be on as much, like you people will really miss me, well, other than Aa(not saying the name)."

"event","9 days and the moon pulls nearer. 9 days and we might find solace. 9 bloody days only to have a 6 day break, and wait 9 more. The moon draws nearer and pulls on the heart, and it relinqueshes deadly emotions to drive us insane. It's a constant pull that we all feel, it's just a matter of how we handle it. Tensions rise, and rise some more, making us angry and bitter and mean. Tears fall from eyes that have seen too much, or too little, and chemicals flow through veins that are too often damaged. Why does the dark torment us so? Why must the moon raise and fall and destroy our souls? Why must life be so hard? Why must it rip people from others? Why must it make our eyes weep. It turns fathers to drinking, it turns people to guns, it turns mothers on daughters, it turns fathers on sons. It turns people to false dreams, to false pleasures and false hopes. Why is it so? Please, oh higher deity, shead light on the matter, open the book just one page, give us a sip of the sweet sweet nector, give us reason so we don't have to be so diabolical, so we mustn't hurt yet another soul."

Your birth on the 19th day of the month adds a tone of independence and extra energy to your life path. 
But at the same time, it poses a number of obstacles to overcome before you are able to be as independent as you would like. The number 1 energy suggests more executive ability and leadership qualities than your path may have indicated. 

A birthday on the 19th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. However, a somewhat self-centered approach to life that may be in conflict with some of the other influences in your life. 
This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush. 

You are sensitive, but your feeling stay somewhat repressed. 
You have a compelling manner that can be dominating in many situations. 
You do not tend to follow convention or take advice very well. 

Consequently, you tend to learn through experience; sometimes hard experiences. 
The 19/1 is a loner number and you may experience feelings of being alone even if you are married. 
You may take on a tendency to be nervous and angry.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

I said everything there while tainted with emotion, but would it hurt to try and tell me you would miss me? You said it would be a waste, is my friendship not worth saying it at least once? Almost everyone feels like their alone at some point, and they just need reassurance, am I any different? Is there still no point? Good things? Sure, I'm still alive blah blah, but the way I am, I worry not about those. I don't worry about death, sure there isn't much I have done, but death doesn't scare me that much. ""At least your not as bad off as those in New Orleans."" I've been close. And another thing is, I'm trying to stop ""out doing"" people, and I don't want to get any back. I worry about here and now, not there and now. I'm not there, I know no-one there any more, they all left. I mean, sure it's sick whats there, looting, rape, etc. but it's not effecting me or my family. I have 10 people in my house, my dad has no work (70, can't get any more), we barly can pay our bills, my car is dieing, the van died, school sucks, work sucks, school grades suck, life fucking sucks. I'm not even going to go into it any more, you know, so I'm not called immature any more."

I hate this, because today does suck, and one part hates it, yet the other half is content, and it's pulling me apart, like I can almost literally feel a separation between my two halfs. The sad half is my right side, I can feel it. My sad side feels bad for Eli, feels bad for the van (which died today), feels bad for my grandma (who is at the hospital now), feels bad my car is dieing, feels bad about the tension in my house, wants to leave, thinks about the lack of room in my room, thinks about how we're strugling day to day for money to pay BG&E and the rent, worrys about my sleep, about my over all health, hates my parents, hates life basically. My content half looks at the car as sexy, not at the fact that it runs, simply that it's a sexy car, looks at the people who care, but when I think about it, all that my content side should think about, doesn't care about, honestly. Sure it's cool the people who are giving us money, but I still have lights, I'm still typing, I still have money, I still pay insurance, I don't care. My right side is taking over. It's deadening. It throws it all out of perspective. People love me, sure, but who would truly miss me if I left. Sure you can say you would, but I would be forgotten. I have a bunch of friends, but it's all just aquantences now. I had one very good friend, whom I considered the ultimate, and we have drifted, we let the fact that we don't have classes rip us apart. I love her as my sister, and I know it's visa-versa, but it's becoming a stale love. It's there, and thats mainly it. I get a negative vibe from just about everyone I talk to. They talk back, and have the smile, but they sometimes just want me to go, and so I move on to another ""friend"", whom I get the same vibes from, and I walk some more, and it's a constant visouse cycle. I'm tired, listening to the Righteous Brothers, making me sadder, and Eli, man.

This made me sad, because last time I thoughouly enjoyed kids night, and I wanted to hang with some of the kids again. So what did I do, I basically made Rose feel bad. Man, she (can be) so friggin awesome. In other words, I was switched up-stairs, and Leslie was moved downstairs. I have to talk to Rose and Tim and Matt just to thank them. Anyways, I was upstairs working the kids night, and it dawned on me, I like hanging out with these kids, and bar tending... but thats besides the point. Of course, this time it was crazy, there were 30 stuck-up kids, and unlike last time, most of them WERE stuck up. But there are the select few that are so friggin awesome. It's also fun talking with my co-worker and like making predictions on where their going to go with life, what their going to be. Like theres this group of girls that sat all to themselfs, and we thought, thats the art creative type that will soon see Mr. Bell. And there was this small girl, really cute, and Brittany said ""Shes going to be a heart breaker, look at her."" She had long curly black hair, totally a heart breaker prospect, not saying that long black curly hair makes you a hear... yeah, I don't care if you get the wrong idea. Anyways, it was just fun hanging out with them, as it was last time. Of course this time I was so tired and there were so many of them, and just being the only guy there and them always coming to me because I picked one up (my word, thats crazy, you play around with one, pick them up, the others see, and they suddenly start swarming), and because I was the most out-going one of the three of us. The other two kinda didn't know how to handle some of the kids like I did. And it's so crazy, these kids are so young, but there is already so much drama there, relativly. It's sad how far into our generations it's starting to reach. Gosh, I love kids."

I love and hate the way the things in my life collide.

I don't know how to feel about myself right now. I feel like I'm defeated by a mass invisible army. They hack away at my soul and try to get at my heart. I'm slowly being destroyed and not a single person can save me.

Unless that is why this is happening. Strange occurrences set in place by fate. Fix her, they whisper gently. She's changed. Give her light, give her air, give her water. She's a plant that needs to grow a little bit longer. No one can wait for when she finally blossoms, but remember you're the one who holds the watering can."

I'm the bitch??
Fuck you, you arrogant prick.
After all I try to do for you, after I move away to my parents house as if I am on some form of retreat?
Retreat from you maybe.
I'm not dirt on the bottom of your shoe. You need to know that.
Damn this is stupid.
I'm writing to no one and bitching about nothing that will in turn have people judging me.
Win-win indeed.
However should I act? Should I write you a congratulatory letter on a job well done?
I wish that I could take all the things I want to scream at you and shove them so deep into your ear canal so that for the rest of your life all you can hear is my voice shouting the things you've yelled at me.
I am so sick of being second. I never thought of it that way before.
I can't have my own emotions, because you hog all the emotional space for the both us.
You call me a child, and a child I may be, but at least I know where I stand in life.
I have always shown you love, I have always been loyal. Funny you can't repeat that sentence truthfully.
I despise the fact that in the morning, everything will go away. I will only love you again.
I always shall love you, in the deepest and most respectable manner. Well, perhaps not always so respectively ;}
I simply want happiness. I want to change the world for us. I need you to change as well.
Two left turns in life, will only make one right.
See? I've done it already, I've forgotten my anger and turned it into the mushy shit. I loathe what the thought of your face can do to me.
In the end, I still say Fuck YOU."

When the world felt completly perfect?
Like when I'm lying in your arms
And you're sooo strong
I can't contain myself
And I smile and You laugh

This is perfect
A new life is beginning
Doors are opening
A unique path filled with love and loss
This is perfection
I love just starting out
Figuring out what makes you tick
Falling harder the expected
My friends making fun of me
But i don't care
Cause when it's just you and me
That's all I care about
That's all I know
I can't wait to talk to you tonight
And every night
I can't wait to see you tomorrow
And every day
This is perfect

I had a great weekend. Hung out with Steve a lot. He's my new friend:)
hung out with the new second in command, Taylor. Of course Sara is first in command. I don't exactly know what all of that means, but it's good. I worked a lot. It sucked. I feel kind of bad, b/c when I went and hung out with Steve and I brought Taylor, it was really lame. But we left and I picked up a kitty for taylor. The cat tried to drive, it didn't work very well. Me and taylor had a grand time visiting Ryan at work, we didn't even know he'd be at the drive thru his first time!! we were both very proud....I talked to David. He's taking tests tomorrow...I hope he does well so he can accomplish something in his life.Oh, well, peace."

"event","I love my life. Everything never goes to plan, but of course, it could never be any fun that way. Sometimes, I hate everything here. I hate the world for being cruel and I hate people for being so goddamn spoiled and nasty to one another. But I look around, and when I see all of the love out there, all of the hope and the faith, I can't help but feel it myself. I feel the love and pain and hope and there's lots of things out there that are horrible and mean, and then I think about it. I think about us, and I thank God I'm here. I thank the Lord above who gave me all of this. I'm not a religous person, but when you think about it, you have to believe something great is helping me out. Getting me, getting us closer to our goals. Life is messy and people just have to stop fucking complaining about it, otherwise, when are you going to have time to focus on the things that really matter? Like the people you love, and the things you like to do. Enjoy it, cause you don't know when a chance to live may come around again."

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one i got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But momma i fell in love again
It's safe to say i have a new girlfriend

And i know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And i'm afraid i might give in
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And alka seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then i don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know i'm young but if i had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

(ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been awhile since we talked last and i'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But dad i'm finally thinkin' i may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And i know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long
But i promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da)

I love the way she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then i don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

It's gonna be a long drive home but i know as soon as i arrive home
And i open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back in my arms into my arms once more for sure

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one i got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there
Man i swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song
But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh i ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word
And i would still cherish every moment
And when i start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere i go i keep her picture in my wallet like you

The last man on Earth
Gave hime everything she ever had
He'd break her spirit down
Then come lovin' up to her
Give a little, then take it back

She'd tell him about her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord he loved to make her cry
""You're crazy for believin'
You'll ever leave the ground""
He said, ""Only angels know how to fly""

And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly

One Sunday morning
She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly

With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly

Do you know what I've been doing every night before I go to sleep? I go downstairs and eat either a nice bowl of ice cream or popcorn, or any other available snack. Then I take a shower that lasts forever and then I go to sleep and have dreams about whatever movie it was that I was watching. This is my life. The people at the movie store know my name and all about my life. Like the day I knew I wasn't going to see David ever again and then I got pulled over, I was in the Video Vision parking lot and I started to cry and when I went in I was still crying and I told marvin my story and he told me to cheer up and when he gets his only day off in almost a year, he'll take me out, which always makes me laugh b/c I know he's just kidding, but those guys there are better then fucking bartenders. Plus I've known Lillian since I was about 6. Now those are pretty carefree people. I go there at least once a week and rent about 5 movies at a time.

When the babysitter arrived the two children were already fast asleep in bed. So the babysitter just got to sit around and make sure everything was okay with the children. Later in the night, the babysitter got bored and so she wanted to watch tv but she couldnt watch it downstairs because they didnt have cable downstairs (the parents didnt want their children watching too much garbage) so she called them and asked them if she could watch cable tv in the parents room. Of course the parents said it was ok, but the babysitter had one final request. She asked if she could cover up the large clown statue in their bedroom with a blanket or cloth, because it made her nervous. The phone line was silent for a moment, and the father(who was talking to the babysitter at the time) said.....take the children and get out of the house.....we'll call the police...we dont have a clown statue..... the children and the babysitter got murdered by the clown. it turned out 2 be that the clown was a killer that escaped from jail. if you dont repost this within 5 minutes the clown will be standing next 2 your bed at 3:00am with a knife in his hand."

"event","<P><lj-cut text=""Description of my thoughts threw others words""> I cannot find a way to describe it
It's there inside; all I do is hide
I wish that it would just go away
What would you do, you do, if you knew
What would you do

[Chorus:]
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you 
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable; come and take me away

I feel like I am all alone
All by myself I need to get around this
My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you
If I show you, I don't think you'd understand
Cause no one understands

[Chorus]

I'm going nowhere (on and on and)
I'm getting nowhere (on and on and on)
Take me away
I'm going nowhere (on and off and off and on)
(and off and on)

[Chorus]

Take me away
Break me away
Take me away</P>

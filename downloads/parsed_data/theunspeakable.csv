"event","<b>What Does The Word ""Love"" Mean To You?</b>

I've become convinced that alarm clocks were orignally created as some kind of torture device, as there are few things that can compare to the pleasure of a long, lazy sleep. But I force myself out of bed early every morning, because I love the smell of the air. Having spent long enough in dark places to last a lifetime, I love sunlight.

And I get up early to prepare myself for work, because I love my job. I've seen and done things that can scarcely bear imagining, but after it's all said and done, I love the work I do. 

I have met men in similar positions as myself, who do the same kind of work because they have nothing else, no one else, to give themselves to. I consider myself very lucky, to have never considered that a reason for why I do my work. 

I do the things I do, because I have people that I love very much. My family of course; my parents, and my little sister. And Bill. Everything I do, it is to protect them, to make their lives better. Even during the arguments, the time and distance, there are few moments that I treasure more. 

Love to me is like energy. It is magic. It is a reason to remember why I am fighting. And why I am happy."

"event","Aidan stretched absently, a soft, crackling rustle as he spread his long limbs out over the sheets. 

Every muscle in his body twinged, sore, ache kicking up in response to the movement. But Aidan let out a low purr, anyways. He stretched out a lazy hand and reached over, brushing his fingers lovingly through Bill's hair. 

""Mmmm. That was something. I wasn't expecting it to take this long to wear you out.""

He'd lost count after the third or fourth time."

"event","The object was small. Simple. One would have almost thought it beautiful, were it not for all the damage it had caused. 

Aidan had been watching it for the past hour. He'd circled it, back by the walls where it was a safe enough distance away, prowling around it like a cat. Finally given up and lounged slightly in the doorway, the tension in his frame invisible. He could feel the magic rolling off it in waves, dark and corrosive and metallic on his tongue. 

It was dangerous. He knew that. He'd already been to two funerals that week because of the bloody thing. Damn old timers. 

So, now the case was his. Well, his and some cursebreaker's, and whoever he was, he was late. Aidan tugged absently at his collar, frustrated. Why'd they have to give him some bloody rookie cursebreaker to look after? The Ministry knew he worked better alone."

"event","<b>Describe what your ""happily ever after"" would be like.</b>

My idea of Happily Ever After has changed many times over the years, as these kinds of things often do. 

When I was a child, Happily Ever After was nothing more than the woods behind my house stretching on forever, filled with mystery and adventure. It was disappearing into those woods to explore, never to return again. 

That is until fading sunlight, scraped knees and an empty stomach would turn the intrepid explorer back home again, when his mum called him for dinner.

Those Happily Ever Afters were soon forgotten with the promise of a wand and a letter summoning me off to Hogwarts, where they were replaced with dreams of becoming a great wizard. Auror, Quidditch Captain for England, future Headmaster. In that Happily Ever After the work I did was perfect; I never made mistakes. People flocked to me. 

That dream was interrupted. By blue eyes. A bright smile. Fiery hair and a sharp tongue to match. 

I was almost twelve when he was sorted, sat down beside me in the Great Hall more unabashed than any other child I have ever met. That was the beginning. 

At first it was friendship, then something more. Then everything. For a time we lost each other, and there was barely any happy ending I dreamed of until we found each other again, changed from what we remembered, older and wiser. But ever since that first day, one part of my Happily Ever After has remained constant. 

Bill. I wake up next to him every morning, when he's already mumbling about coffee. I tell him that I love him every night, before we drift off to sleep. We quarrel, and then make up again. He's incorrigable, I'm stubborn. We share our happiness, and pain. 

As long as I have him in my company, I am living my Happily Ever After."

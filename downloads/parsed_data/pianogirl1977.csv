"event","Well, it's a new year.&nbsp; I'm not sure about this whole blogging thing - but we'll give it a go. Maybe it will help me get some of my feelings out. Maybe it will help me to connect better with people - that would be a good thing. 

Last year was...interesting.&nbsp; Lots of changes, good and bad.&nbsp; The best obviously, was our little angel, Gabriel. He was born on September 15, 2008.&nbsp; I&nbsp;love being a Mom.&nbsp; He is the greatest gift I have ever been given, and I thank God every day for my little boy. 

Another change, we moved from MN to IA.&nbsp; The juries still out on whether that was the best decision we could have made. But we are slowly but surely becoming used to this foreign land - I mean state. :)&nbsp; My biggest thing is I&nbsp;haven't really made any new friends since moving here.&nbsp; And my old friends are great - but they are busy and they live at least 30 minutes away and...I'm whining. The truth is...I&nbsp;love my husband and baby and family soooo much, but I miss female friendship - the kind where you can call somebody and say hey - let's go see a movie - or lets just hang out - or lets gp shopping.&nbsp; I think some people think because I have a baby that I must be WAY too busy to do anything - but I'm really not. And the reality is that I have met a few people here in Waverly, but none of them seem interested in being friends - they already have there own lives and schedules to keep. 

So - yeah - that's what's on my mind right now.&nbsp; You'll find I am not always this cynical. Just lately - I've been lonely.&nbsp; I need to branch out, try to meet new people. Blah. I'll try to be positive - it is a new year after all!"

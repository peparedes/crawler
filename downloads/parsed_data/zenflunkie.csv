In a Village Voice piece on New Yorkers' New Year's resolutions, Allison Sommers testified that she aspired to ""recognize joy when it bites me in the ass."" That so happens to be your main assignment during this season of love, Leo. It shouldn't be too hard: The bliss coming your way will not be of the elusive, ephemeral variety. It's got teeth, and won't be in the least shy about using them. Happy Valentine Daze!"

You are a gentle soul, with good intentions toward everyone.
Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

We live in the Milky Way Galaxy, which is shaped like a pinwheel. Recently, astronomers were shocked and embarrassed when they realized that the pinwheel has a fifth arm, one more than they've always believed. It's not as if this extra appendage has been hard to spot: It's 77,000 light years long! ""I was absolutely flabbergasted,"" astronomer Tom Dames told NewScientist.com. ""The fifth arm was quite clearly seen in previous surveys but was never pointed out or given a name."" I expect that a comparable discovery is about to unfold in your personal life, Leo. An important clue to your destiny--an open secret that has been ""hiding"" in plain view--will finally register on your awareness. 

No one knows you better than you do, Leo."

[Verticle Oracle card] [Leo (July 23-August 22)]
The puzzle is not as difficult as you imagine. In fact, it has only seven pieces -- far fewer than you've assumed. Perhaps you got thrown off by its simplicity; it does have a superficial resemblance to a more complicated puzzle from your past. The ironic thing is that you'll never figure it out as long as you're so serious and stressed about it. To create the conditions that will lead to a solution, relax, have as much fun as possible, and assume that the puzzle will soon solve itself.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Leo."

instead of struggling with life, we would be better off embracing it. instead of worrying about what should and shouldnt be, we would be wiser to deal with what is actually happening right now. it is a deep let-go of all these ideas and beliefs of what one thinks should and shouldnt be. things become much simpler then.  life is too short. why die depressed?"

"event","""Truth has nothing to do with authority, truth has nothing to do with tradition, truth has nothing to do with the past - truth is a radical, personal realization. You have to come to it. 

Knowledge is certain; the search for personal knowing is very, very hazardous. Nobody can guarantee it. If you ask me if I can guarantee anything, I say I cannot guarantee you anything. I can only guarantee danger, that much is certain. I can only guarantee you a long adventure with every possibility of going astray and never reaching the goal. But one thing is certain: the very search will help you to grow. 

I can guarantee only growth. Danger will be there, sacrifice will be there; you will be moving every day into the unknown, into the uncharted, and there will be no map to follow, no guide to follow. Yes, there are millions of dangers and you can go astray and you can get lost, but that is the only way one grows. 

Insecurity is the only way to grow, to face danger is the only way to grow, to accept the challenge of the unknown is the only way to grow.

When we are truly in a spirit of adventure, we are moving just like a child. Full of trust, out of the darkness of the forest into the rainbow of the light, we go step by step, drawn by our sense of wonder into the unknown. 

Adventure really has nothing to do with plans and maps and programs and organization. The Page of Rainbows represents a quality that can come to us anywhere - at home or in the office, in the wilderness or in the city, in a creative project or in our relationships with others. Whenever we move into the new and unknown with the trusting spirit of a child, innocent and open and vulnerable, even the smallest things of life can become the greatest adventures."""

""God is a comedian playing to an audience that is too afraid to laugh,"" mused eighteenth-century French philosopher Voltaire. What's ironic, I would add, is that the moment you summon the courage to laugh, God's jokes become tonic rather than cruel. They have a cleansing effect, and often tend to break down the obstacles to your dreams. Are you ready to make the transition, Leo? The planetary omens suggest that you have ripened sufficiently to find the next divine punch line hysterically funny. 

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Leo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes."

"event","at best politiks is highly entertaining and amusing... if you have a dry sort of humor. at worst its depressing as shit. why die depressed? 

its all propaganda. oh you know. the rightwing has its little agenda going on, which of course is everything that the leftwing isnt. pretty simple stuff. anyways, and they've got all their tentacles draped across everything and are the powers that be behind major news networks and other corporations that also happen to be ""rightwing"", so they can assist in the propaganda machine. the left wing has its own propaganda machine which is naturally against everything that the rightwing is for. in the end they're all a bunch of rabid dogs. 

i hearby declare myself free of paranoid news fantasies. i dont care who's writing it. i dont give a shit if its bill o'reilly or michael moore. like i said. at best it's pure entertainment. your mind can go on and on with politics all day long, and never come to an end. but you got to know when to stop. life's too short to be so DAMNED serious over something that could be strangely amusing... if you look at in in a grand scheme sort of perspective. 

who am i voting for? nobody. that's who. not because i'm apathetic but because 1) i'm a felon ^_^! and 2) the world and the governments of the world have been doing their thing long before i came along and will continue to do whtever it wants long after i'm gone. nothing i do will become my own idealistic view of what i think should be. there. i said it. i honestly dont give a fuck. anymore. fuck it. 

what i do give a fuck about, is LIVING. our natural birthright is to the pursuit of life, liberty, happiness, and ALL of that.

but politics impacts everybody!

yes indeed. but, like i said. what will be will be. i'm interested in simply evolving as being.

life, happiness, freedom, death, rebirth, joy sorrow ecstasy bliss depression and suicide. 

i dont give two shits about ""changin the world - ma!"" i'm interested in being. and in expressing this being, as simply and creatively as i can. 

i have nothing but love for this whole world, and everyone in it. EVERYONE. all the good guys and middle guys and bad guys. and everyone in between. i have nothing but love for this entire universe, at least what i ""know"" of it. i have no desire to join some radical political activist group, or go to protests and demonstrations (though i did happen to end up at the portland peace camp for about 45 mins one day) whatever, its all good. i find great intellectul satisfaction, poring over political propaganda. simply because it is such a ""real"" world subject of thought. and it satisfies the minds deepest drive:to be occupied 

its all speculation in the end. 
at worst it really is depressing as shit. you become paranoid. you start reading into everything your're hearing and seeing in ""the news"" - which is only merely another mechanical aspect of politiks. believe nothing that you hear. believe nothing that you read. and believe only half of what you see. a wise old drunk insane indian told me that once. chief firewater burn. 

if religion is the opiate of the masses, then politiks is the wine. oh yeah, i dont think there's really a separation between church and state, just two sides to one coin - pun intended, sorry. kiss my ass) 

in the end, its mental stimulation, that we've been hooked on for eons. its time to let it go and open our eyes.

i find it quite ironic when i walk out on my back patio to a beautiful sunny day, and all i hear are hundreds of birds playing to a symphony my ears dont hear, and i think of how beautiful it all REALLY is, while at the same time i'm thinking about war, and politics, and hell on earth. its kind of surreal really. 

then i start thinking about death. and i think its arrogant to think that mankind will persist through all time and change in the universe. a universe of nothing but change. that statement may not be entirely correct. anyways, i think that it doesnt really matter what happens. 

unless they try to send me to war.

i will not go to war. ever since i got in that fight with mcCloone, and had to sit in jail and serve two years probation, i've grown tremendously. i realized for myself why violence was not only ""WRONG"" but simply ridiculous. i've been learning alot about myself since then. ALOT. i am totally opposed to killing another human being, unless of course in absolute self defense for my life, and i will not go into a war where i'm pretty much forced to shoot otherwise, i'll end up dead. i would be quite the pissed off young man. why? because it goes against my ""personal convictions/ beliefs""
to me, another human is apart of myself. to go to war would be suicide. i can accept war as a fact but i absolutely do not condone war. period. there is no such thing as an honest or righteous, or morally just war""

war is just that. war. hell on earth. demons of hell delight! the blood of men spills tonite. oh yes. you better believe. its ""black magic"" taken to the most grandiose extreme. the gross manifestation of all of our collective ignorance and arrogance and greed andfear and lust. it is destruction. it is the ancient story of a scorched earth. it is the most violent expression of all that is called ""evil"".human sacrifices for the gods.

may the lord have mercy upon their souls.

and whatever else floats your boat. this bodymind is the ship and you of course are the captain. why drift mindlessly? why die depressed?

why get yer poor old brain all worked up and uptight over shit that doesnt really matter anyways? 

does any of it really matter? or will you be dead and gone before you realize it doesnt?"

Now that you're in the ambition-building phase of your yearly cycle, I figure you're ready for a fresh set of cute aphorisms. Use the following to fuel the fire in your belly, the chutzpah in your heart, and the gleam in your eye. 1. If you don't run your own life, someone else will. 2. Opportunity often slips by unrecognized, disguised as hard work. 3. Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself. 4. Be willing to give up what you are for what you can become. 5.

According to the New York Daily News, Leo novelist Danielle Steel had a tailor embroider the word ""bitch"" on 16 pairs of her socks. I suggest you do the same. If that's too extreme or time-consuming, write ""hard core"" on your ankle with a felt-tip marker. If that would sully your dignity, at least imagine that you have a tattoo on the sole of your foot that says ""wise-guy"" or ""riot grrrl."" The point is not to send a tough message to the general public, but to make a secret pact with yourself. No one else but you needs to know that you're planning to become better grounded and more fiercely assertive."

"event","""The colors of the mind, excited by a flower or the moon should not be seen as self at all, but we think of them as our self.""

- Dogen, from Shobogenzo chapter 91 (Yui Butsu Yo Butsu ""Buddhas Alone Together With Buddhas"")

 Nice one, Dogen. Now Dogen was a Japanese monk who lived in a temple way out in the mountains of rural Gifu Prefecture in the 1200's. Looking at flowers and the moon were the kinds of things that turned him on. He was, shall we say, easily amused. We'd have a much better world if more people today were so easily amused. But we aren't. Zen dudes get all hung up on images of flowers and water and trees and all of that and it blinds them to any real understanding of their own situation which usually isn't all lotus blossoms and babbling brooks. 
Today we could say, ""The colors of the mind excited by a CNN report on the looting in Baghdad or the incredible lame-ness of the latest Madonna song should not be seen as self."" Or even, ""The colors of the mind excited by a noisy and belligerent web-page whose writer claims to be a 'Buddhist' should not be seen as self."" Whatever it is that grinds your crankshaft, be careful you don't start looking upon it as your ""self.""
Human beings have amazingly highly developed brains and for that reason we get easily confused between thought and reality. Our biggest, most deepest, most astoundingly brilliantest thoughts are nothing more than thoughts. Just electrical activity, changes in the organic chemistry of the brain. Big fat hairy deal. It's easy to say this. But it's really really hard to actually come to grips with it.
We take the colors of mind to be much more than they are. But our thoughts are only thoughts. They go just so far and then stop. All of them, even the most urgent, the most violent, the most sexy, the most profound. They just go a little way and then peter out. Poof!
Your body reacts nearly the same way to vivid thoughts about imminent danger as it does to real danger. And it's not just thoughts of danger that work like this. It's all of our thoughts. Rather than just living your life moment by moment as it happens, you're stuck in all these twisting swirling loops of thought that have your body reacting in all kinds of ways it doesn't need to in response to situations which not only do not exist, but which never could possibly exist. No matter how much you think you can encompass the whole universe in your conscious mind, it'll never happen. Whatever future situation you're worried about right now -- no matter what it is -- will never come to pass. I guarantee this, no matter who you are or what you're facing. It can't happen the way you imagine it. 
In your mind you have created this thing called ""me"" which you believe thinks and feels and experiences. You're terrified of the day that thing will come to an end. And you're petrified that this ""me"" might someday find itself in some horrendous situation. You make all sorts of efforts to protect this thing above all else. You buy it gifts. You show it off to the world and hope that others envy it. You want it to become rich and famous. To live in a beautiful house with a bodacious wife or a hunky husband. Every minute of every day you look for new reasons to make believe it exists and that it is important.
But it doesn't and it's not.
It's a phantom, an illusion. This thing you've elevated to God like stature does not even exist. It's just another thought. No bigger or realer than any of your thoughts.
You are not you because you are everything.
This isn't just a philosophical position I'm taking. It's the real truth of the matter. It's something any human being can become aware of, and once you become aware of it it's impossible to doubt. You won't suddenly learn the secret numbers to everyone in the world's bank cards. Yet you will come to understand in a very profound way that you and everyone else share exactly the same body and mind. Or, as Buddha said, ""I, along with everything in the universe, have become awakened."" 
And yet you find you can't really express it to anyone. Even though anyone you might care to try and express it to is you and therefore sees it just as clearly as you do. 
Ironical, ain't it?
You are everything because there is nothing else you can be. You are reading yourself. There's really nothing else that could possibly be happening. There is nowhere else to go.
And, just by the way here, when you see that everyone is you and you are everyone, you'll also come to understand that everyone in the world is just as dumb as you are. This will alleviate a lot of the stress you feel. It's hard to worry what other people might think when you realize their thoughts are just as dopey and meaningless as yours."

"event","as taken from the story of the Garden of Eden. eve is tempted by the serpent to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. ""you will become as gods, knowing good and evil"" the first division is made, and humanity has been caught up in the net of duality ever since. constantly choosing one over the other, and suffering the consequences of those choices. ""we want nothing but the good, and want to eradicate the evil"" we say. fools! both are one. creation yields destruction yields creation! its all apart of one movement, not two separate movements. how could we know the good, without the backdrop of the evil, and vice versa? how could we recognize light without darkness? children know of no such dualities, or even non-dualties until they are taught by the serpent of education. now the mind is divided, the quote unquote ""ego"" arises. and in order to transcend the dualities and non-dualities, we have to unlearn everything, because everything we think we know only becomes a burden, becomes too much weight and cripples our wings, and tightens the shackles of our ignorance and arrogance.

"event","""I wanted only to try and live in accord with the promtings that came from my true self. Why was that so very difficult?Every man is more than just himself; he also represents the unique, the very special and always significant and remarkable point at which the world's phenomenon intersect, only once in this way and never again. That is why every man's story is important, eternal, sacred; that is why everyman, as long as he lives and fulifills the will of nature, is wondrous and worthy of every consideration. in each indidvidual, the spirit has become flesh, in each man the creation suffers, within each one a redeemer is nailed to the cross. Few people nowadays know what man is. Many sense this ignorance and die more easily because of it... I do not consider myself less ignorant than most people. I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceaseed to question stars and books. I have begun to listen to the teachings my blood whispers to me. My story is not a pleasant one. it is neither sweet nor harmonious as invented stories are, it has the taste of nonsense and chaos, of madness and dreams - like the lives of all men who stop deceiving themselves. Each man's life represents a road toward himself, an attempt at such aroad, the intimation of a path. NO man has ever been entirely and completely himself. Yet each one strives to become that - one in an awkward, the other in a more intelligent way, each as best he can. Each man carries the vestiges of his birth - the slime and eggshells of his primeval path - with him to the end of his days. Some never become human, remaining frog, lizard, ant. Some are human above the waist, fish below. Each represents a gamble on the part of nature in the creation of the human. We all share the same origin, our mothers; all of us come in at the same door. But each of us - experiments of the depths - strive towards his own destiny. We can understand one another, but each of us is able to interpret himself to himself alone....""

There was alot of head nodding in response to my answers, and they even had me fill out an application which is definitely a good sign. They are offering $10 per hour, 40 hour work weeks with overtime, i work 4 10 hour shifts and get not one not two but three days off. They also have one of the best benefits packages i have ever heard of, not only medical dental and vision, but legal, 401K, and they have a variety of insurance companies i can go through, like blue cross/shield, kaiser, etc etc. So hopefully they give me a call in the next couple of days. and if i dont get the job, at least i'm starting to get interviews. will keep you posted"

'your inside is out, your outside is in'. war = ignorance. recognize and realize, the rest will take care of itself."

Subway would be equally as nice considering i love sub sandwiches, and the harware store would just be *bitchin* either way, any job i end up getting is gonna pay more than unemployment and will afford me and shawna to be able to move into a place of our very own minus the other room mates we are currently living with.

What's the best way to get yourself in sync with the plans that the Goddess has for you? Follow poet Robert Bly's admonition to ""poke holes in your habits."" Here are a few suggestions to get you started. Strike up a conversation with a person you'd normally ignore. Write with your non-dominant hand. Try a food you've never tasted. Sprinkle seldom-used words like ""sublime,"" ""curiosity,"" and ""reverence"" into your conversation. Walk backwards now and then. Slap a crafty grin on your face and wish for something impossible."

If you eventually become a millionaire philanthropist at some later date, it will probably be because of the forces you set in motion during the next three weeks. If, in the 22nd century, there arises a religious cult that worships you as a sex god or love goddess, it will be because of a seed you germinate very soon. Finally, Leo, if you are ultimately destined to discover the key to eternal youth, it will have a lot to do with the spacious new question you begin to ask now. These are days of awe and mystery.

<lj-cut text=""Unreleased song""><b>She Loves Him Still</b>
<i>Stevie Nicks
<small>(unreleased)</small></i>

No one heard her call his name,
No one heard the sound she made.
They would not like it much anyway
To know that she still loves him.

No one understands this love,
No one ever will.
'Til his dying day,
Not even he himself can change this;
She loves him still.

I miss my friend,
I miss the sound of his laughter.
She remembers him saying,
""Well, where are you going?
Just what is it that you are after?""

No one understands this man,
No one ever will.
'Til his dying day,
Not even he himself can change this;
She loves him still.

So, how are you?
Have you learned to deal with it?
""Oh, no,"" she says,
""No, I have not learned.""
You see, I cannot deal without it,
So the flame still burns,
The flame burns on.

No one understands this love,
No one ever will.
'Til his dying day,
She was heard to say
She loves him still.

And the sands of time like shattered glass go past her,
She still loves him.
Oh, no, they would not like it much anyway
But she still loves him.
And the sands of time like shattered glass go past her,
Straight back to the sea.
She still loves him.


<a href=""http://buckinghamnicks.net/sn/unreleased/sheloveshimstill.html"">Song analysis excerpts</a>
<blockquote><i>The message of the song, I believe, is simple: she still loves Lindsey. She always considered Lindsey to be the love of her life, even after she left him and they both were with other people. Accordingly, the song starts out very sad. No one knows how much she misses him - but even if they did, they wouldn't like it. Perhaps she feels people (maybe even Lindsey) have grown tired of hearing her dwell on it so much, or impatient with her for mourning a love she ended. [...] no matter if he loves her or hates her, she will still love him. [...] she talks of missing having Lindsey as a friend as well, and not just as a lover. They were friends before they were lovers, but when their relationship ended, that ended, too. I doubt she got to see Lindsey smile much in the aftermath, and that made her sad. Then she adds that no one can understand him, but that doesn't matter to her. The implication here is that his complexity is one of the things she loved about him, as directly after that statement, she repeats that she still loves him. Even after so much time has passed, she still can't get over him, even though, again, she was the one who ended it. [...] they'll never get back together. Though she may still love him, their relationship now will never be more than platonic. Not to imply that she's going around clutching a photo of Lindsey to her breast and weeping herself to sleep - after all, it's not like there was a big chance they would ever get together again anyway. Even so, there is a psychological difference between a slim chance and no chance at all, and that difference might have hurt her heart just a little bit. But despite all that, it all comes back to the fact that ""she loves him still.""</i></blockquote>

And a song written by Lindsey Buckingham that's just... ow. Y HALO THAR NEXUS!MOVIE!ROY.

<lj-cut><b>Book of Love</b>
<i>Fleetwood Mac
<small>(written by Lindsey Buckingham)</small></i>

Walked out, goodbye.
I swore I never would cry.
Tore a page of my heart,
She wants me to be her friend.
I'm lonely again.
Tore a page of my heart.

Oh, tell me who wrote the book of love?
Was it somebody from above? (ha, ha, ha, ha) 
Surely he must know all the rules. (ha, ha, ha, ha) 
Knowledge not meant for mortal fools.
Must have been someone from above.
Tell me, who wrote the book of love?

In silence the lonely make
All their mistakes.
Tore a page of my heart,
Someone in Heaven above
Show me how to love.
She tore a page of my heart.

Oh, tell me who wrote the book of love?
Was it somebody from above? (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Surely he must know all the rules. (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Knowledge not meant for mortal fools.
Must have been someone from above.
Tell me, who wrote the book of love?

And one last unreleased song that I also really love for this Riza in this aspect of her with her interaction and history and relationship with Roy... (I'm lovin' on this song just for the rhythm in the words. I want this MP3.)

<lj-cut text=""She saw it all, it was a tiresome ending / He stormed out, hearing the door slamming / Behind him / Ooh, she didn't even know why he left her.""><b>Joan of Arc</b>
<i>Stevie Nicks</i>

They wanted images when images weren't spoken,
They depended upon illusions,
Calling the illusion gold and glitter,
And they came in tired,
And they said ""Tired was the end of the line.""
Well, I can't save you,
Joan of Arc, this time.

Turn to the wall, baby.
Turn it to the wall, now.
Turn it to the wall,
Joan of Arc.

Turn to the wall, baby.
Turn it to the wall, now.
Whoa, no, there's really nothing that you can do for me
To make me better.

Well, there's a few martyrs in a century.
They take a limousine,
Because everything else is taken care of,
And they don't even know what they died for.

Turn to the wall.
Turn it to the wall,
Joan of Arc.

Ooh, turn to the wall.
Turn to the wall.
Turn it to the wall, baby.
Turn it to the wall, child.

Gone like the wind
Like the stars in the dust.
Well, her little toy soldier 
Is covered with rust,
And your beautiful eyes, whoa,
Well, they look sad to me now,
And I don't even know why you left me.
She saw it all, it was a tiresome ending.
He stormed out, hearing the door slamming 
Behind him.
Ooh, she didn't even know why he left her.

He said, ""Turn it to the wall, baby.
Turn to the wall.
Turn to the wall, baby.
You go up against the wall, now.
Turn it to the wall, Joan.

Ooh, turn it to the wall, baby.
Turn to the wall, now.
Ooh, up against the wall, baby.
Well, I can't save you this time.

Turn it to the wall, baby.
Turn to the wall.
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.
So turn it to the wall.
Get up against the wall, baby.
She says, ""Is there anything that I can do for you
To make you better?""
So, just turn it to the wall, baby.
Turn to the wall.
Oh, no, there's really nothing that you can do.
Turn to the wall, Joan.

Ooh, turn to the wall.
Turn it to the wall, now.
Up against the wall,
Joan of Arc.
Oh, no."

"event","<i><b>[[Log and short summaries concluding Roy and Riza's road tripping around Amestris and critical moments, bringing them back to the point in time to go to the Nexus]]</b></i>

<lj-cut text=""I never had nerve to make the final cut."">*******

<i>If you negotiate the minefield in the drive,
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes,
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall,
Dial the combination, open the priesthole,
And if I'm in, I'll tell you what's behind the wall.</i>

[[<i>Summary written by <lj user=""light__of__day"">-mun</i>]]

For numerous factors, relating to their AWOL status and Roy's injury, Riza is the sole driver through this. She's also purchased a bit of laudanum she takes to help her sleep, which is usually done in the front seat of the car for a few hours each night stopped in a remote location.

She's fallen off the diet that Russell had prescribed for her, which <i>had</i> been doing some marginal good -- not enough, but a bit. She's just this side of an emotional breakdown.

There's not much said between her and Roy through this. She's taken him around so they can visit with the others -- separately, of course. She lets Roy go first, and then visits with them for a short bit while he waits on her. It's mostly a time of assurances that they're okay and goodbyes. 

Kain Fuery almost follows Riza back -- but he's got too many family ties of his own to keep him in Amestris. But he sees something in Riza's eyes that has him very worried, and he brings these worries up to Roy before they leave. 

Kain was their last stop among the men, stationed not quite as far as Dublith, but at an outpost south of Central. They drove north again through Central with a stop off at Hughes's grave, and then further still, with Roy directing Riza toward a more remote area to the Northwest. Meanwhile, over the last day or so as they near his destination, he'd considered what Kain had told him.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::has been more or less silent all this while unless spoken to, very deferring, demure, very servile demeanor, tending to everything that she can and still anticipating what she can for him. She knows none of this is easy for him either and she's -trying- so -hard not to add to that, to make it as easy as she can; silent, looking out the windshield, only half-seeing the road - not that there's really anything to watch for; she's paying enough attention to it to not drive into a ditch::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Sitting back, watching the road as well... mulling over everything that Fuery told him... glancing at Riza every so often, studying her...::

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::For the record? Once they're done with this trip, he REFUSES TO GO FOR CAR RIDES ANY MORE!::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::she's about 10 pounds underweight, she doesn't each much, her hands shake almost constantly, just tiny little tremors, and half the time, when just looking off, her eyes are wide and just a bit confused/scared/bewildered-looking;right now, she's rather blank-faced, kinda fixed-gaze and as still as one can be while driving::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Pull to the side of the road, would you? ::Looking out the window still::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::glances to him, murmurs a soft agreement; it's a country road with precious little in the way of anything up there, stops with one wheel off into the grass and engages the parking brake::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Are you feeling all right? ::He's more in the mood to probe her to see what kind of answers he can get before he calls her on anything::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::looks at him quickly, wide-eyed, bewildered, maybe just a little panicked at being asked that out of the blue, like a cornered animal; blinks a few times, then her lips curl into a big smile without her eyes changing:: Wha- &lt;_&lt; Of course. Why? What's wrong? Are you all right?

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Looking at her now:: ... ::Sighs, looks out the window:: &lt;q&gt; I see. ... You know, Kain told me that he was worried about you. ::Letting that hang for a moment, waiting for her reaction...::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::looks out the windshield, hands still on the wheel:: Kain is a very sweet man and he worries about people he cares about. He's always worried about me, it's just his nature.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Looking at her again:: &lt;q&gt; He told me that he was concerned that you might be suicidal. I told him that that was foolish, what with the fact that you've got a new life with someone who cares about you, someone who needs you. ::He's actually not going to call too much attention to loss here, that's a touchy subject for him...:: After all, Edward's been through so much. I know you wouldn't want to put him through any more anguish. ... And if I'm wrong, then I guess Kain was right, 'cause Riza Hawkeye would already be dead before she'd do that...

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ........ ::getting paler as he talks, gripping the wheel until her knuckles are white, eyes wide and looking somewhere else that's not there in the distance, breathing shallow and unsteady, like the breaths are reflexive and she's trying to hold her breath and stopping each quick intake as soon as it starts, not saying anything at first::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Keeping his eye on her:: ... &lt;q&gt; Breathe, Hawkeye. 

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::tiny little tentative breaths that gradually get deeper and even out:: &lt;q&gt; Of- of course not. ::shriveling a bit - gaze dropping; maybe people think she would because she's already abandoned one person she supposedly cared about, didn't she?::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; I don't suppose you'll be -honest- with me if I ask what's on your mind?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::looking away, closing her eyes, still gripping the wheel like a lifeline:: ... &lt;vq&gt; I know - I know all that, an- and... that's... the only reason I don't, some days. And wh- what I was thinking... it's probably a bit much to expect people to believe that. That I wouldn't, I mean.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Why? ::Looking at her, leaning his head back against the window:: 

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;vq&gt; Because people think... see me as... having already abandoned one person I said I cared about. Wh- what's... it's not like I have any sort of track record for actually... be- being there, staying. ::her voice is shaking, and it's harder and harder for her to breathe again as she talks and she is not letting go of that wheel for anything::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; -Breathe-, Hawkeye. Do I look like I think that? Do I? ::Looking at her:: I did, once, but that was a couple years ago. I've had time to think, to examine what happened. You quit, but I left. 

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::slightly deeper breaths now, but still shallow:: ... &lt;vq&gt; And I don't blame you for leaving at all. and other people think that way too. I... I realize now... it doesn't matter what I meant. ::voice is thicker now, strained:: J- just... what I did.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; I didn't mean to hurt you either. Lots of mistakes on both our parts once our plans reached their end, huh?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ... ... ::slow nod, shaky sighing breath:: ... &lt;vqw&gt; Can ... can I explain something, please? 

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Nods slightly:: &lt;q&gt; Go ahead. ::Keeping his hand gently on her forehead, kinda steeling himself against anything here...:

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::eyes still closed, still shaking:: &lt;q&gt; I -did- try to find the way home, for months. By the time he showed up, I didn't know if I'd ever see Amestris again. ::or you:: It might be easier to understand what I'm talking about after you see it. A familiar had to force a portal, and I only met Belladonna myself recently. And after Dante had me kidnapped... after what happened... Kain would have been on the money with his fears. If anyone had left me alone for a while... he refused to. I think he knew. It was after that. ::she didn't just wake up one day and hop into a new romance or anything::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Nods slightly:: &lt;q&gt; I don't doubt it, Riza. It's not something that you just leap into...

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vq&gt; I'm sorry. I know it's not something you wanted to hear anything about, but... I couldn't... leave it just perhaps looking like I'd up and moved on and everything was fine and dandy. I spent a week in a cell after Envy pulled a perfect imitation of you to get me out of the AVF to deliver me to Dante... and I didn't think anyone would look for me.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; You're in a good relationship. ::That's really all that he's willing to say about this...:: &lt;q&gt; I couldn't really ask for a better situation for you.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ... ::looks at him... giving him a teary, lopsided attempt at a smile:: &lt;vq&gt; I'm not looking for approval or forgiveness, don't worry... I just... ... know what it feels like to think... it must have been very easy to... move on. Forget everything. And feel like... none of it was worth as much as you'd hoped. ::voice cracking, looking at him:: I don't expect or ask for any forgiveness. I ... I... the last thing i want is to mention any of this to you, to run a risk of it being like I'm rubbing your face in it when I'm not meaning that. I just want... you to know that I did not wake up one day and be over everything. Because I lived with those questions too and they hurt.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> .... ::Just can't say anything, just keeping his hand on her forehead, brushing his thumb over her bangs lightly::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::doesn't mind that, knows there's really no easy way to say or take any of that... but was in that position of honestly believing she hadn't been worth that much to him if he could walk away from her so easily, and knows how much more it hurts being able to believe something like that:: ... ::opening her eyes again, looking at him:: ... ::closes her eyes and rubs them, ducking her head, and drawing in a shaky breath:: ... &lt;vq&gt; I'm good enough to keep driving if you want.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; You're sure?

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::Probably only noticable now, but he's whining for attention in the back::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Yes, I- ... &gt;_&gt; ... ::ah, hell with it, turns off the car:: or maybe as long as we're stopped in the middle of nowhere, I'll let him out for a bit

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Looks back... faint, dry chuckle:: &lt;q&gt; That's probably a good idea.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::opens her door and gets out, letting Hayate out::

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::bounding -out- of the car... sniffing around quickly... okay... stay near the car and mom, or go to the little puppy's ditch?::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Contemplating staying in the car... gets out, stretching his legs::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::leaning against the driver's side, looking up at the sky, humming quietly to herself::

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::Okay, grass for the puppy!:: 

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; So, is there much wilderness in this Nexus?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Not really like this... it's a very... civilized sort of nature that I'm not sure is entirely real. ::turns around to look at him, leaning on the car:: Matter of fact, you go to the far edges of the developed areas.. and there's nothing there. I mean that literally. It's just... blank. Nothingness. Just whiteness. Save for portals here and there. It's a place between worlds.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> .... ::Nods:: I see. &gt;_&gt; That's going to take some getting used to.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> It does, but at the same time, it's also convienent. I spent 2 weeks of vacation time in a ... well... it was several decades after, and probably wasn't the same world per se, Earth is the world where Edward wound up. Anyhow, on Earth, in a place called Texas, just... a little motel by a river for a couple weeks by myself. A very interesting place. ...:;quirks a lopsided, wry smile:: They have a car model there called 'Mustang'. The one I saw was the same color blue as our uniforms had been.

Roy's just trying to do some basic surveilance of the house when his father rides up on where he is. They probably wouldn't say much to each other, but Roy's dad would tell him to come back to the house, and that he and Roy's mom have both missed him. He'd then ride back towards the ranch house, leaving it up to Roy whether or not to come. I think Roy'd wait there for a few minutes, kinda... ""Oh fuck, what now?""

He would go to the house, if only because he doesn't want to be remembered as having run away. His mom would have some coffee, and maybe some cheese and crackers ready, she'd have been a little teary when Roy comes in, she'd grab him in a tight hug. I don't actually see much being -said- for a while... Roy's mom would be doing most of the talking, asking him how he's been, what he's been doing, what she can do... Roy's dad's more the strong, silent type. I get the feeling he'd be a little short tempered by Roy's quiet, short answers and otherwise unapproachability... But he wouldn't snap, and Roy's mom would be doing her damnedest to make Roy feel at home again.

Roy's dad would be the one to tell him that he can stay for dinner, Roy's mom would work to make what she remembers as his favorite... Roy would accept, and he'd say that he's got a driver that should probably eat too, as well as a dog. He'd be pretty quiet, and it -would- frustrate his dad... I get the feeling he'd hug them both before he leaves, though, tell them he loves them, and that he'll be fine.

Riza is still Riza, on her very best behavior in front of his parents, doing all she can to make it as easy for him as possible, and not attract questions or censure or offend them in any manner.

The two and a half day drive back to the East HQ is in almost complete silence. Both of them are ready for this to be over, emotionally and physically drained. Roy spends most of his time laying down in the back seat. Riza pushes herself to her final limits, stopping only when utterly necessary for rest. They still get back a day or so over the one week mark, with Ed having arrived the day before."

An actual IC blog that exists on the Internet accessible in the Nexus which she can update via access at 'net cafes. A blog which she ISN'T telling anyone about (but isn't going to be impossible to find for a net savvy character.)  And no, just making posts to this journal isn't good enough for her, apparently.

She wanted a Vox blog. -_- And she would NOT shut up <a href=""http://rhawkeye.vox.com/"">until I gave her one</a>.

And then <a href=""http://rhawkeye.vox.com/library/post/at-seventeen.html"">she made a post</a>.

Roy has loose ends to tie up and personal business to see to before he leaves for the Nexus, and Riza wanted time to visit with her grandparents and check with the Havoc on her world.

Prior to any travel, both of them took refuge in Lieutenant General Graman's house in the East City, with Riza listed as AWOL and unable to freely move about in public without precautions, and Roy also abandoning his own post, and rested up, preparing for long drives ahead.

As much as Riza tried to stay out of his way, there were moments it couldn't be helped... especially not since she was to be <a href=""http://light--of--day.livejournal.com/32632.html"">driving him around</a> once again in a day or so's time. 

<lj-cut>

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::By the way, Riza? You've had a puppy at your heels pretty much non stop... Even though he's a good four years old, he's still a puppy. &lt;3::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::In the kitchen, frying some bacon for a BLT, not really knowing what else he's in the mood for...::

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::Trotting right behind Riza, tail wagging a bit::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::can't really leave the house for anything; so she's been holed up reading for the most part, or at least, appearing like she's reading, still with that distant, detached disinterest that's been wearing on her the last several months; smelling the bacon but there's servants and her grandparents, the odds aren't high that its' Roy::

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::Bacon means there's a good chance he'll get table scraps, TY Grandpa Graman!::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::carrying the teapot in, paying just enough attention to keep from walking into walls, rather not there for the most part, only realizing he's in the kitchen after she puts the teapot down, expression utterly blank for a few seconds as her brain switches back on::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Looking over to her as she puts the teapot down...:: ... Hello, Riza. ::Slight nod to her::

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ... &gt;_&gt; &lt;_&lt; ::Pads over to Roy tentatively, looking up at him briefly... ... pads right on by him after a moment, heading over to his water bowl::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::looking down, side to side a bit, floundering, that blankness gone, now it's just... ow ;_;:: ... &lt;q&gt; hello... ... sorry... I... I was just... ::gesturing to the teapot and backing up, clasping her hands tight::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; you don't need to apologise, Riza. 

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::Head down... empty water bowl... picking it up in his teeth, padding over to Riza with it, whining once::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::just... frozen, has no idea what to say, and everything she -wants- to say ... isn't anything he'd want to hear; it's that sick feeling of not ever once wanting things to be the way they are yet not able to see where different choices could have honestly been made at the time:: ... 

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::looks at Hayate... crouching, picking up the dish, hand shaking, stepping over to the sink::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Watching her:: ... &lt;q&gt; You don't need to walk on eggshells quite so much, you know...

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ... ... ::looks at him, her expression raw; it was never supposed to be like this, she'd never meant for any of this to happen like this, and more than anything else she misses her -friend- and.. there's no right to even that:: ... &lt;vq&gt; wh-what would you have me say? ::shaky attempt at a smile for a brief moment, just say the word and she'll never bother you again, if you want her to speak of nothing but the weather, she'll do that, just... the last thing she wants is to do anything to hurt him more::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; Just ""Hello"" would be nice. ::Tending to the bacon::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::closes her eyes, hanging her head a moment, deep breath:: ... ... ... ::desperately reaching for a lighter mood, he gave a tiny bit, she's grabbing for it for all its worth, one corner of her mouth twisting into a tentative, uncertain smile, her tone a little lighter, awkward but lighter, making an unsure joke along the same vein as 'say goodnight gracie':: &lt;q&gt; Just hello?

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Sets the spatula down, chuckles quietly:: &lt;q&gt; Was that a joke I heard, just now?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; a really bad one. ::shaky, soft sorta-chuckle, eyes wet, smile trembling as she bites her lip, watching him::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Closing his eye, chuckles again:: &lt;q&gt; Your humor is as dry as ever.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; When it comes around; I suppose it always has been. ... ... how ... is everything settled as you'd like it...?

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; As well as it will ever be, I suppose. ::Nods slightly, picking his spatula back up:: 

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ... &lt;vq&gt; I don't mean to walk on eggshells. ... I just don't quite trust myself to not say a million and one things I shouldn't.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Nods slightly:: &lt;q&gt; I suppose I can understand that.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::turns away again, filling Hayate's water dish and setting it down:: ... ... ::staying crouched, eyes closed, trying to hide the fact she's shaking like a leaf, and trying to work up the nerve to say something:: ... ... &lt;vq&gt; d- do you ... do you hate me?

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::Oh boy, water!!!:: ::diving right into the bowl, tends not to drink too much when Riza's unsteady like this, prefers to keep her company...::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; I don't know. It would be very easy to. ::Shakes his head::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::exhales a shaky breath, eyes still closed, remaining crouched:: ... &lt;q&gt; fair enough. It -is- rather easy some days.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Do you hate you?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::the mun's blinking a bit at how /much/ sometimes...:: ... ::low, dry chuckle, pushing herself to her feet, eyes still closed, forcing a smile, opening her eyes but keeping then downcast:: Doesn't everyone have days like that sometimes?

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Sighs:: &lt;q&gt; Idiot. You should know better than that... ::And so should you, dummy.::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::tiny shrug:: &lt;q&gt; it's common ground we can agree on, if nothing else?

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; I suppose there is that...

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::we can both agree to hate me; works for me:: ... .... &lt;q&gt; want me to cut a tomato for you?

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::That's not what I meant and you know it... okay, maybe you don't. Sigh... not that I know what you meant. Double-sigh. I used to be able to read you...:: &lt;q&gt; Sure. Thanks.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::nobody can usually, for whatever it's worth; silently getting out the cutting board and a knife and the tomato, slicing with care and caution, hand a bit shaky::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Glancing at her out of the corner of his eye::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::arranging the slices on a plate and turning back to the fridge, getting out some lettuce and prepping it for him::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Thank you for the assistance. ::Finishing the bacon:: &lt;q&gt; Is it all right if I give Hayate a piece?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::the mun doesn't know how readable it is, but she still cares about him as much as she ever did, in the way she's so easily doing little tasks to help:: &lt;q&gt; It's fine. Grandfather's spoiled him anyway.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::That much is readable... which makes the whole ""I can't be with you"" or whatever it was from the post-rescue scene all the more painful... Mun's a bit too tired to look right now. XD:: &lt;q&gt; You're going to unspoil him, right? ::Laying out the cooked bacon, draining off the grease::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; Eventually, I'm sure. I suppose. 

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; ""Eventually"" means ""When I get him home, and we're settled in."" Right?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Yeah. It would be easier rather than trying to retrain him while expecting him to adjust to a new place.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Good.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;vq&gt; You're welcome to come visit him, if you'd like. I'm sure he'd not mind the chance to see you.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; I may just do that, sometime. ::He's trying to keep talking here, but he's also having a hard time with topics, and not showing the hurt...::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::pretty much in the same boat; and the mun wonders if maybe he'd not feel better if he just vented all of that at her::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::would pretty much buckle under the weight of guilt if he did. XD All that time up north didn't exactly blind him to -everything-... just his own self-worth::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::she already is, or rather, has:: ... ::there's not much to keep her in the kitchen now:: ... ::really, really, really wanting to say something, but...:: ... ::looking at him, watching him::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Just giving Hayate the bacon, crouched and scratching him behind the ears:: &lt;q&gt; He's missed you. ::""I've missed you.""::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; I know. ... I dare say he's missed you too. ... the way it all was.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ::Nods slightly:: &lt;q&gt; Those were good times. 

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... ::deep, shaky breath:: ... &lt;vq&gt; There's a lot of things... but if I had to pick just one thing I missed most of all, above everything else... I miss my best friend.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... ::Looks down, scratching Hayate's head:: &lt;q&gt; I miss mine too. But it hurts too, seeing her again.

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;vq&gt; I know. ... Sh- she... she'll stay away if... that would help, b- because the last thing she wants to do is hurt you any more than she already has. ::voice thick, cracking; eyes wet, spilling over::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; How about you give me time to find out what I'm going to do now?

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::nods, exhales, her breath shaky, sniffles:: &lt;vq&gt; Of course. ... J- just... just do whatever you need to do to be happy again. That's all I ask. I... I *never*... meant to hurt you, I'm sorry.

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Stop apologising. ::tone a little harsh... &gt;_&gt; Mun's poking him::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> ::goes silent, biting her lip, eyes closed, taking a step backward, said too much, stayed too long::

<b>&lt;Roy&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; Just give me time. ::Shaking his head, drawing his hand back... returning to making his sandwich quickly::

<b>&lt;Hayate&gt;</b> ::Cocks his head... looks at Riza... bounds after her quickly::

<b>&lt;Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vq&gt; Of course... ::taking another step back; doesn't want more tea or anything else, turning, retreating from the kitchen kinda aimlessly at first and then to the guest room where she's staying::"

&lt;Riza-mun&gt; You know how I can see <lj user=""kryptonite_al""> making an Al-type nuisance of himself with Roy? XD;; going by frequently just to say and be all... well... Al-like?
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; ^_^ Of course. He's Al, after all. ::Grins::
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; I can see movie!Riza going to <lj user=""patient_heart""> asking her to teach her how to make something like apple cobbler, etc? Well... she'd make a bigger pan for them (3 males in that age group in one apartment? It won't last long XD;) and a smaller one... and I can see her giving the smaller one to Al to take with him... but... ""If he asks about it... just say Trisha made it.""
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; Awwwwww... ;_; ::Petpets Riza::
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; She's insisting she doubts he'd touch it if he knew she had anything to with it, and i'm not so sure she's wrong either. -_-;
<i>* Vergil-mun nodnods. -_-;</i>
<lj-cut text=""And there's more... damn, you two pups are messed up -_-"">&lt;Riza-mun&gt; Even Al's skeptical about how far his own fixing ability can extend. He's -fairly- confident that he can, after some work and time, at the very least, get Roy back on speaking terms with <lj user=""superman_dead"">. But he's said it flat out, ""With her? I wouldn't bet anything on it. That's not to say I wouldn't try, but... even I wouldn't place any money there.""
<i>* Vergil-mun nodnods.</i> ""I wouldn't say it's impossible, but he's -very- definitely not of a mind to speak with her...""
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; -_-;;;;; idiot; I didn't think how much harder it was to keep them under control when I'm tired.
<i>* Riza-mun has just been sitting here sobbing for the last few minutes thanks to her -_-</i>
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; ;_; ::Nods::
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; It was just this little small statement in thought ""... ... ... &lt;q&gt; he hates me."" - and... yeah -_-
<i>* Vergil-mun nods, cringing.</i>
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; I wouldn't say it's impossible to mend things... just... not easy. -_-;
<i>* Riza-mun nods</i>
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; It's just her thought process that follows in the path of trying to just... comprehend that. She sees the root of the problem being that she buckled. Completely cracked. Just wasn't strong enough to live up to what she was supposed to be. &gt;_&gt; and remember, Archer shot her in the shoulder? She keeps thinking it'd have been better for everyone if it'd hit a few inches over to the right instead.
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; -_-;;; Riza... Riza Riza Riza... what are we going to do with you?
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; It's just... &gt;_&gt; everything else followed from that, and where -was- she supposed to go from there? Especially once she wound up stranded in the Nexus - she *DID* look for a way back pretty hard those first few months she was there.
<i>* Vergil-mun nodnodnods.</i>
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; She needs to realize that it's not her fault, and more importantly, -he- needs to realize that...
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; &lt;_&lt; I really don't think she can until he does. She... could come to -terms- with it in due time, but... as long as she's blamed for it, she's not going to be able to realize it wasn't her fault. ... which is even more frustrating because she cannot think of a single option open to her over any of that which she didn't try or could have done differently... so it doesn't just turn into fault, it's overall failure as a -person- in her mind. Al -miiiiiiiiight- be able to help, at least to getting him to where he'd be even -willing- to realize that... but Al doesn't know anywhere near enough about things to actually bridge that &lt;_&lt; and even if he were on speaking terms with Ed, I'm kinda doubting Ed could do it either.
<i>* Vergil-mun nodnodnods. ;_;</i>
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; The movie really fucked everything up for all of them... ::Grumbles::
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; XD;; not necessarily the complete fault of the movie here, but yeah. -_-
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; Well, for starting them down this road. ::snerks:: -_-
<i>* Riza-mun nodnods
* Vergil-mun can't see Roy in a positive mindset at -all- once the movie's taken place.</i>
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; Or that point in time/those events, etc. since technically the movie events never take place here XD;
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; Well, yes. ::Snerks, nodnods:: The movie and the events leading up to it. ^_^
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; ...
<i>* Riza-mun eyes <lj user=""draconicroyal"">.
* Riza-mun wonders... &gt;_&gt;</i>
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; The relationship was different, but... overall essence...? It's not that different. Van -adored- Folken so damn much. And then came that intense feeling of being utterly betrayed, and oh, how he hated him. ... and he never got a second chance.
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; ...
<i>* Riza-mun eyes Van, can hear one thing from him...</i>
&lt;Vergil-mun&gt; Yeah?
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; ""I'm not going to ask for details or split hairs or even ask for answers. The only person you really have to answer is yourself. So... just ask yourself this... If she were to die tonight, would you still think what you're holding onto now was worth holding onto tomorrow?""
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; And leave it at that.
<i>* Vergil-mun isn't sure if it would reach Roy... &gt;_&gt; Mostly just because he's not sure what can and can't reach him right now.</i>
&lt;Riza-mun&gt; Van&gt; I don't expect any instant flashes of change. I probably wouldn't have listened either. But if he lets himself think on that question, sooner or later he'll have his answer one way or another."

Riza had gone for her run earlier that day. It was a nice respite from everything, pushing herself to the point of collapse, to where it took every ounce of her attention and concentration to just keep moving, to keep her feet hitting the ground step by step, stride by stride. No room left for anything else.

She'd returned and showered, and stood there in her room, hair damp and clad in clean clothes, at a loss what to do or where to go next. She wasn't feeling hungry (as usual) she'd had a glass of water before her shower and wasn't particularly thirsty either. The idea of reading, or anything else, they just left her with a now-familiar feeling of 'why bother'.

The herbal antidepressant remedy Russell had come up with worked a little bit; she wasn't feeling quite so... insanely on the edge and in a constant crackling state of buried frenzied panic, trapped in her own mind. Instead, it was just a dull, lazy lethargy, a listlessness that left her content with doing nothing at all.

And nothing at all was what she chose to do -- as usual. A comfortable chair by the window, and a blank, numb state of mind, looking at nothing in particular and scarcely moving."

"event","Thanks to Ed and Riza, we figured out where exactly Al's being held, and what's more, how the characters can figure it out, and another reason why the Military's not doing anything.

J, if you want, you might want to make a short (private or filtered for now) post to <lj user=""ruthless_path""> getting Roy into position. It's not necessary since how he got there would be easily enough inferred from things.

But Al's being held in a condenmed neighborhood on the west end of Central, in a building in easy proximity to a relatively large hospital. That makes evaccing the area problematic.

<lj-cut text=""How Roy gets involved"">Roy got involved because Graman called and alerted him. He said he'd check into what he can do, but he hasn't been back in touch with him since. It's likely it turned into a case of one thing leading to another, and him grabbing opportunities as they crop up, and not having the time to call to get others involved when the clock's ticking for Al.

--</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""What Graman knows of the situation""><blockquote>""We know the group started with survivors from Liore, but they're not being too exclusive about who they let into their ranks.""

He shook his head. ""We're fairly certain they're actually operating out of Central, at least to some degree, because they've been able to stay on top of military movements to avoid them. Now, it's possible they've got someone on the inside, but not likely, given the animosity between the parties. There's a map with other places they've caused some ruckus in the last few days, and groups like these usually operate out of cell organizations.

""As far as your brother goes, reports have him on a train bound for Youswell, but if that was his destination, which I doubt, he never arrived. There's a few train depots before there that are nothing more than pickup and dropoff stations, and don't always have anyone around them, and he probably got off at one of those, since there's been no reports of any battles on any trains. We know your brother came back to Central, and left a day later after getting a telegram. He never said who it was from, but when Lieutenant Havoc and Mister Armstrong found the place, the desk clerk informed them that all he said was, and I quote, 'stupid people doing stupid things again'. Then he asked for a train schedule.""

He tapped the files. ""There's reports and maps and anything else I thought might possibly be of use in there. I also called Mustang a few days ago to see if there was anything he could do, and he said he'd look into it, but I haven't heard from him since.""</blockquote>
--</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""How Riza and Ed narrow down the possibilities of where Al is"">Riza and Ed narrow down the possibilities, and it's very, very likely that Riza's following the same path of logic that Roy would take.

<blockquote>Ed sits down, thinking. ""He was last up near Youswell, but you said they operate out of Central. If they're really as stupid as Al said they were, then it's possible they took him right back to Central. That seems... really stupid, of a special variety, though. So maybe not.""

He shakes his head. ""Anyway it goes, I can't see them taking him anywhere near Liore. If they thought he was me, and they blame me for their problems, which they probably do, given they were after me in the first place, they wouldn't want me near that place anymore. That, and I doubt they'd want to attract military attention to their city again.""

*

""Central,"" Riza said suddenly. ""He's somewhere in Central. Possibly either in a highly populated neighborhood, or somewhere in range of one.""

*

Edward looks up at her quickly, then glanced at Graman briefly before looking back to her. ""A highly populated neighborhood? How do you figure?""

*

""You said it yourself. They blame you for Liore, for what the military did. They're probably assuming a large military response to their actions. Reports have indicated they've got activity in Central, right?"" Riza said, speaking quickly, a brisk, animated note to her voice as she stepped closer, almost on the balls of her feet. ""They wouldn't want to lead a possible military fallout onto their own city or their own people, but if I were going for a revenge shot, what better than two-fer?""

*

Edward stares a second, then blinks, this information slowly sinking in. ""Either prevent the military from doing anything at all, or force them- or me- to chance our own civilians in the fight.""</blockquote>
--</lj-cut>

It's also striking me as possible that there's a chance for a bomb threat with the hospital - it's close enough that they could have wiring run there to a detonator (radio remote isn't available in those days) and a risk of them holding the place hostage if the military tries anything. It hasn't come up since they've not given away their location, but if the military found them and made a move, it's a good place to have hundreds of hard-to-move ready-made hostages to sweeten the pot. Another bit of strategic reasoning that might narrow things down even further. I dunno if it would occur to Ed (and if it did, it might not matter) but it strikes me as something Roy would think of for narrowing down the possible places where Al is."

In less fluffy news though, I might be scarce for a few days. Al-mun and Lust-mun might understand why. I think I need a reset period from a lot of stuff online. It's not a Nexus-specific thing, it's just overwhelming burnout and picking up on the regional vibes of high anxiety and stress (yey for living so near a major uni -_- - this happens every fall) If I am, Ed-mun (and possibly Vergil-mun though I'm not sure on that) might be scarce as well since it's affecting all of us too. Some rest and downtime might help."

She carried out with that thought without a word, and had retreated to her room to quickly change; then out came a heavy box from the back of her closet shelf, and the gun within was loaded for the first time since she couldn't remember when. She only had one now, but she knew where she would be able to get more in Amestris if it came to that.

So far though, she wasn't certain what she would need. They were back in Amestris, back in Central, and all they knew was that Al had been kidnapped to an unknown location, and the kidnappers were demanding the return of the Fullmetal Alchemist.

Riza was thrilled for that, no mistake or question. But at the same time, it made her a little antsy, because that also meant it was time to tell him two bits of potentially bad news, hopefully before he might hear it from other sources -- and possibly in a not-good way.

She knocked lightly on the doorframe of the room where he was staying, looking in to make certain he wasn't asleep."

"event","Blame this on <lj user=""deconcentrate"">. He started it! XP

<lj-cut text=""Here's my list of all the pups I play on LJ/Nexus""><b>Here's my list of all the pups I play on LJ/Nexus</b>

<lj user=""anna_starfury""> - a character from another game, and I haven't and won't bring her into the Nexus. The journal mainly exists for <lj user=""dear_mun""> posting. She's the Anna <lj user=""alchemical_bros""> mention on the rare occassion.

<lj user=""darkelfpirotess""> - Pirotess, a dark elf, is a character in <i>The Record of Lodoss</i> war.

<lj user=""deadlywithguns""> - manga!Riza, made to pester <lj user=""burnedbyadoggie"">. Since that username was relevant to who he was and what he could do, so is hers. She <i>is</i>.

<lj user=""draconicroyal""> - Van Slanzar de Fanel from <i>Vision of Escaflowne</i>. Part Draconian and the king of Fanelia, it fits.

<lj user=""filia_ul_copt""> - I've actually had this journal for several years now (since Nov. of '02) which is why I could get her actual name for the username. Filia from <i>Slayers TRY</i>.

<lj user=""highcalibre""> - Young!Riza, although the account was originally made with mid-series anime Riza in mind. That idea was scrapped but I had it sitting around when I needed one for that Riza, and it worked for her. It's a pun/double meaning. Calibre can mean both diameter of a bullet, or quality. 

<lj user=""imperfect_path""> - like the previous Riza, this account was originally made for something else that got scrapped, but it fit well enough to be revamped for the Riza from beyond the end of <i>Bluebird's Illusion</i>, Pride Ending. In retrospect, the name fits BBI!Riza better in the long run. The name came from two things, Fleetwood Mac's ""Seven Wonders"", and a line Roy had in the final episode, ""the world is imperfect; that's why it's beautiful.""
<i>""So long ago, / It's a certain time. / It's a certain place. / You touched my hand, and you smiled. / All the way back you held out your hand. / If I hope and I pray, / Ooh, it might work out someday. / If I live to see the seven wonders, / I'll make a path to the rainbow's end...""</i>

<lj user=""kryptonite_al""> - the brother of <lj user=""superman_dead"">. Beyond the obvious Superman and Kryptonite parallel, it's also a reference to the Three Doors Down song, ""Kryptonite"".

<lj user=""Light__of__day""> - movie!Riza, and the first pup I had in the Nexus, and still my main one. The username is from the Stevie Nicks song ""The Nightmare"". <i>""And she knew the dream was over, / But the nightmare was not over. / Somewhere in her ancient ways / She walks through the night, / And then she tries to get through the day. /[...]/ She was blinded by the light of the day...""</i>

<lj user=""live_for_moment""> - a pup I haven't introduced yet. Created for another game that didn't pan out, Donna's been revamped for the Nexus. Her username comes from the fact that she knows her time left is very limited, so she lives each moment to the fullest that she can.

<lj user=""mrs_hughes""> - Gracia Hughes, wife of <lj user=""papa_to_asobou""> and mother of <lj user=""mostestprecious"">. The username should be pretty obvious.

<lj user=""mrs_mustang""> - Another Riza, the wife of <lj user=""fuhrer_mustang"">. (see below.)

<lj user=""on_turning_away""> - Ryan Hawkeye, from <lj user=""pigs_onthewing2"">'s world. His username's from Hughes-mun using a Pink Floyd reference for a username for Hughes, and I had no idea where in the world to start getting a username for him, so I went digging in my PF lyric files and finally found a song that fit Ryan, ""On the Turning Away"". (Full lyrics in his userinfo.)

<lj user=""royal_justice""> - Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun from the <i>Slayers</i> series, <strike>in</strike> for her justice speeches. She's also the crown princess of Seyruun.

<lj user=""tas_burrfoot""> - Tasslehoff Burrfoot, the kender from the <i>Dragonlance Chronicles</i>.

<lj user=""wortcunning""> - Russell Tringham. The username comes from the old name for knowledge of herbal healing and magic. Since he's a botantical-oriented alchemist, it fits.

=======

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The three pups from another mun who's piggybacking this post"">

The following pups are not played by me, but by <lj user=""jchaos"">. Since he only has the three, we're just piggybacking his list onto mine.

<lj user=""opposingsoul""> - Vergil from Capcom's <i>Devil May Cry</i>. His username comes from an exchange he had with his twin brother Dante in the final battle cutscene.

<lj user=""fuhrer_mustang""> - Husband to <lj user=""mrs_mustang"">, and the Roy from <lj user=""lucklessinlove"">'s Amestris. The Nexus needed a Mustang who made it to the top. ^_^

<lj user=""ruthless_path""> - movie!Roy, made for BBI!Riza. Besides the parallel in the username, it also holds a lyrical parallel to both <lj user=""imperfect_path""> (which stems in part from a Fleetwood Mac song) and <lj user=""light__of__day""> (which stems from a Stevie Nicks song) by being inspired by the Fleetwood Mac song ""Destiny Rules"".
<i>""Maybe we were together in another life. / Maybe we are together in a parallel universe. / Maybe our paths are not supposed to cross twice. / Maybe your arms are not supposed to go around me. /[...]/ When I see you again, / As I always do, / It appears to me that / Destiny rules, / And the spirits are ruthless with the paths they choose. / It's not being together, / It's just following the rules. / No one's a fool.""</i>"

And never heals.
Standing face to East,
Waiting for an answer.

But the only sound is desert wind,
And when the wind was cold.
Bundled up and packed away, we shiver still,
Finding more than one wind blows.

Something, I don't know.
I couldn't shake it,

Plaster tells me nothing.

Now I'm supposed to understand.
Don't you think you're asking too much?
What kind of fool do you think I am?
Don't you think you've hurt me enough?
Still you want to be friends,
But I don't want to be just friends.

So before you start with your sympathy,
Just turn around and go.
And if he breaks your heart, don't come crying to me,
I won't be there anymore.
Go ahead and cry your tears,
'Cause I'm not gonna dry your tears.

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me.
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be.
These hard feelings run deep.
These hard feelings run deep.

I'll be all right, don't you worry about me.
I'll take care of myself.
The first thing I need is you out of my life,
The last thing I need is your help.
Sorry I met you.
Sorry I met you.
I will forget you, someday.

I've got hard feelings
When it comes to you and me.
And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be.
These hard feelings run deep.

I've got hard feelings

And these hard feelings
Just won't let me be.

"event","I am <i>weird</i> when it comes to character ages/birthdates. I was only off by a year in guessing how old Riza was in relation to Roy before their birth years were released/translated (I guessed 5, it's a 4 year age difference.) Not the first time I've been accurate on those guesses, and not the last. 

Riza only has a canonical birth year (1889) not a birth date or month. Over a year ago, I had to come up with a birthdate for her for another game, and since then, I've stuck to it for various other RPs and fics for lack of having anything else. She looked like a November sort, and my instinct kept pointing to early November. So I went with Nov. 6th. I brought this up in discussion to point out something Ed-mun noticed; Ed's birthday is (canonically) in January (superman_dead's is in very late Dec.) so that makes the age difference between him and Riza closer to 8 years than 9.

A friend, on a whim, plugged November 6th into a Blogthings quizlet to see what the birthday said about that person. o______O Do I know how to pick 'em or what?

"event","I may be laying low for a few days RP-wise. I'm extremely stressed out from RL crap, and on top of it, I'm getting a lot of flak for something I had no part in regarding a very large community I help mod, and I am thisclose to telling every single comm affiliated with it to go fuck themselves sideways with a rusty chainsaw and cut ties completely. (And surprisingly no, it's not fandom)

I'll try to reply, but they'll be sporadic, and if there's something you WOULD like me to comment on with anyone, pleasepleaseplease let me know as I'm probably not going to be paying close attention here.

But to make this a bit more on-topic... some RP-related things.

I'm not immediately familiar with the Five Stages of Grief - meaning, I know of them, but can't routinely rattle them off in order or what all they are (and sometimes I forget how many stages there are, exactly XD;) But I was looking it up last night on a hunch for something else, and for random trivia, looking back, I realized that's where movie!Riza is. The stages aren't always set in stone in order and sometimes stages are skipped. She's been through Denial, and then Bargaining, then Anger, and currently is in the Depression stage.

(don't mind me, I find stuff like this fascinating, especially when pups progress in realistic ways on emotional things, and I don't realize it till after the fact.)

Secondly, <lj user=""al_intheblue"">, <lj user=""alchemic_pride"">, I've been kindasorta tossing around the idea of dragging in BBI!Riza. I'm not 100% sure I'm gonna yet, but I'm poking at the idea. But it's also kinda up to you two, especially since everything I'm getting off that Riza when I poke in her direction is majorly effed up. She's still heavily in denial - no body was ever found, so she's still been holding onto hope all this time that maybe he's still alive. And Al and Pride would have to tell her otherwise, and she WILL hate them for a while for that. For getting Roy involved in that mess and for breaking that little shred of hope. (which is why I wound up investigating the stages of grief, on a hunch - she was in denial, and this is the anger stage liekwhoa) and she's going to be rather... difficult for <i>anyone</i> to get along with for a while, acidic and reclusive and angry at the universe. 

I'm not sure if I want to touch that. If I do, it depends on you, and if I get a green light there, also on another possibility that <lj user=""opposingsoul"">-mun and I are discussing that's also iffy about touching, whether he takes up movie!Roy for an extended character or not. What say you?"

<b>Doing The Best That I Can (Escape From Berlin)</b>
<i>Stevie Nicks</i>

It was one for you, it was three for me.
It was very nice, it was everything.
So here it is, in little pieces.
I just played the part, I didn't win or lose.
Maybe next time I'll think about how I'm feeling,
'Cause I'm doing the best that I can.

And the whispered secrets go on and on,
No one says anything to anyone.
You watch after her, and your word is law.
She thought she was out there, but nobody saw.
I didn't win or lose, I just threw the cards,
But I paid a price for it.

And it's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.
And I'm trying hard to change, I'm doing it the best that I can.
Well, because fate causes fortune, and fortune takes it away.
Well, it's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.

I was silent, I was locked away,
But I covered my tears,
Silent all day.
It's out of my hands here.

In my distress, well, I wanted someone to blame me.
In my devastation, I wanted so to change.
In my way, disaster was the only thing that I could depend on.

But it's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.
Yes, it's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.
Because fate causes fortune, and fortune takes it away,
And then fortune causes nightmares, nightmares that make you crazy.
It's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.
It's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.
Oh, he says, well, I hear you're doing fine, and you're doing the best that you can.
Well, he says, oh, I hear you're doing fine, and you're doing the best that you can.

Ooh, she says, it's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.
Yes, it's all right, baby, I'm doing the best that I can.
Oh, and he says, I hear you're doing fine, and you're doing it the best that you can.
Oh, and he says, ooh, I hear she's doing fine, and she's doing it the best that she can.
Oh, and I paid a price for it.
I'm doing the best that I can."

<b>Aftertones</b>
<i>Janis Ian</i>

Sometimes it's all too much to say aloud,
The sound's a shroud,
The meanings crowd.
Sometimes the words are painful to the ear,
They disappear and nothing's clear.

'Til all that's left to see are aftertones.
I take them home,
We live alone.
But I remember chains of melody.
It pleases me - this song's for free.

Within the memories of our life gone by,
Afraid to die, we learn to lie,
And measure out the time in coffee spoons,
In fading suns and dying moons.

'Til all that's left to see are aftertones.
I take them home,
We live alone.
But I remember chains of melody.
It pleases me - this song's for free.

And ooh, I like the sound
Of harmony from time to time.
I really do believe
In some kind of tomorrow
When it speaks to me."

It took several days after her <a href=""http://light--of--day.livejournal.com/20819.html"">talk with Winry</a> to gather up the nerve. Edward was immensely busy with getting the renovations done as soon as possible, and although she helped as much as she could, not being an alchemist nor a carpenter, there was only so much she <i>could</i> do.

The bedrooms were covered as he rearranged the layout, and at least one of the bathrooms were functional at any given time. The greatest displacement was with the kitchen, making it necessary to order in food (or dine with other residents, which they did a few times, or borrow Al's apartment on the fourth floor to cook) but that was easily dealt with.

She kept debating whether or not to follow Winry's suggestion, at least just yet. She could wait, right? This could wait, couldn't it? She remained pacing in her bedroom, the door open, debating on the pros and cons until she heard him heading for his own room.

Riza made herself speak up before she lost nerve altogether. ""Edward?"" she called out, moving to the doorway to look at him."

The construction was finally complete. Perhaps it was the constant unrest of being uprooted from one place to another, something that was more consistent with her old military days, or perhaps it was faint, lingering traces of paint fumes and other unusual construction scents. Perhaps it was any number of things, including no reason at all that Riza woke up, bolt upright in bed, her hair stuck to her face, her heart pounding wildly and her breathing ragged and harsh, her sweat-soaked skin suddenly clammy in the cooler air.

Dreams of flames, of gunfire, of smoke and blood and screams. Dreams of being cut off, isolated, struggling and fighting, trying to find a safe haven, only to look up and discover a gully, a breaking dam, and drowning.

She'd hoped those nightmares, the drowning ones she'd had on a fairly regular basis for the last year or so, would have stopped. Most nightmares were run of the mill for her, old hat enough that she could ignore them with more ease. But the drowning ones always made her afraid to lay back down, afraid she'd no longer be able to <i>breathe</i>.

Riza often got up rather than toss and turn and risk falling back into nightmare. But not when she thought she'd disturb someone or draw attention to her lack of sleep. But at three in the morning, she couldn't hear any sounds of people being up and awake.

She heated water in the kettle for a small pot of herbal tea, pouring it before it reached a high enough boil to make the kettle whistle. She switched on the light over the sink, sitting at the table, and wearily laid her head on her arms, waiting for the water to steep a bit longer."

He didn't look it, he knew. Too young, too clean. No one turned away from him on the street, averting the eyes, but he waited for them to. Everyone looked away from vagabonds, adrift and homeless. No one wanted to see the nightmares that could be them.

It was the new dress that caught his eye, brilliant blue beside the dumpster, unstained and untattered, the lace still white. But the doll wearing it was like him - clad in an outward appearance of fresh and clean, but underneath it was decay from a life lived too hard. On a whim, a flight of fancy, he picked it up - there. He wasn't alone anymore. Two broken down remnants of an era slipping into forgetfulness to the rest of the world, wearing their disguises of something wholesome and unbent.

Later, pieces started to fall away, the china face and arms laced with spidery cracks, and the paint was faded, flaked off, leaving a ghost trace over the blankness. He tried to keep the pieces together, but he hadn't realized how deep the fissures in the china ran. His broken, quiet companion fell to pieces in his hands, and there was nothing he could do to stop the inevitable.

Glue didn't seem to work, not at first. He'd put the broken pieces back together, but they'd fall apart again before it would have a chance to set. Again and again, until they were both a mess, he tried.

In his attempts, he saw what the doll had once been, how lovely once upon a time. All he had to do was put the pieces together again, to mend the cracks, to repaint the face and bring life back into those dull glass eyes. If he had to hold the doll together long enough to give the glue a chance to set, then hold it he would.

Sleep could come later. Food was something that could wait. It would be so easy to abandon the doll, at least for anyone else, but if he did, he knew the doll was lost. How could he fix anything, if he couldn't fix a broken doll?

With care, he applied the glue one more time, and once more as needed."

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::walking up to the building, kinda forgot amid everything else it was gonna be worked on a bit, blinks a little at it for a moment then... oh, yeah, nevermind; hesitates, walking in... stopping in front of her door:: ... ::lightly knocks and listens; doesn't know if Jean's there or not::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::startles awake at the knock. blinks and rubs at his eyes, frowning- who the hell? &gt;_&gt; This is Riza's apartment, he's figuring she'll just come on in. getting up and walking over to the door and opening it:: ... ::itty bitty smile:: &lt;q&gt; Knocking on your own door, Riza?

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::blinks... faint, awkward smile, glancing past him for a split second, little shrug:: &lt;q&gt; I wasn't sure if Havoc was still here or not... ::fighting the urge to chew her bottom lip, hesitating, stepping in::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::holding open the door for her, taking her suitcase from her (whether she likes it or not) and setting it to the side as he closes the door; looks at her a moment before silently pulling her into a hug- hug, hell, he's practically clinging:: &lt;vqw&gt; Welcome home.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::freezes for a brief moment, slowly raising her arms, then hugging him, lightly at first then almost painfully tight, starting to tremble, burying her face against his neck, breathing getting unsteady::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::just going to hold her tightly for a few minutes, thank you; face pressed against her neck lightly, eyes closed:: &lt;vqw&gt; You've been missed. ::are you staying?::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::tries to answer, but her voice cracks and breaks, dissolving into a muffled sob as she starts crying, not letting up on her grip in the slighest as she nods, the only response she can manage to give::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::yeah, if you thought he wasn't getting wet-eyed at all, you're completely wrong, thank you. clinging to her tightly enough to probably make breathing an interesting feat at the very least, trying to keep from trembling- thank you, god, thank you, don't leave I need you- as he holds her, kisses her neck lightly::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::the way she's clinging to him isn't answer enough to how much she needs you?; sniffles, trying to get her voice to cooperate, making little cracked whimpery sounds from false starts until something remotely resembling coherence comes out:: &lt;vq&gt; Was 'fraid't wouldn't be 'ere...

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::pulls back to put his hands on the side of her face and make her look at him:: &lt;q&gt; Of course your home's still here. I told you, didn't I? I said I loved you. I meant it.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::sniffles, wet-faced, expression crumpling again as she tries to smile, raising a trembling hand to touch his cheek with her fingertips, nods slightly::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::leans in and kisses her lightly, then rests his forehead against hers:: &lt;vq&gt; I've missed you.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::closes her eyes, trembling enough that she's shivering, teeth chattering a bit as she draws in a shuddering breath:: &lt;vq&gt; I- I need you.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... ::gets this itty bitty ;_; look; slips his arms around her again and holds her tightly, face buried against her neck:: &lt;vqw&gt; I need you too, Riza. I -want- you here. I've... ;_; I've m-missed you.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::just clinging to him and crying softly for a few minutes, finally drawing in a trembling breath, calming down and sniffling, nods:: &lt;vq&gt; I missed you too. ::nuzzling his shoulder::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::kisses her neck softly, holding her tightly:: &lt;vq&gt; I love you. ::still on the whole 'she's home T_T oh god she's home &lt;3 ;_;' thing::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::whimpers quietly, clinging tighter for a moment:: &lt;vq&gt; I love you too, Edward... it scares me sometimes how much, but I do.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::quiet a second, then kisses her neck again:: &lt;vq&gt; You don't need to scared of that. I won't let that down, I promise.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... ::quiet... then... shakes her head a little and draws back, sniffles:: &lt;vq&gt; N-no... ::looking at him, trying to figure out how to put it into words:: ... I- I'm scared of... not living up to deserving that... ::closes her eyes, voice cracking:: I- I *do* love you, and I need you an- and I... it's me I'm scared of.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::looking at her, not entirely understanding:: ... &lt;q&gt; Riza? You don't need to worry about that. You -do- deserve it, just for being you. That's enough for me. ::pets back her hair:: &lt;vq&gt; I love you because of you, not in spite of you.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... ::looking at him for a moment... then closes her eyes, bowing her head:: &lt;vq&gt; D-do you really believe th- that I love you? That I -do- need you, that I- I w- was... I was terrified to come back an- and maybe find out that... there wasn't anything to come back to?

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::blinks, then his expression softens and he brushes his thumb against her cheek:: &lt;q&gt; Of course I do. Because you told me you do. ::pause:: &lt;vq&gt; I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't worried that you might not come back. But not because you didn't love me.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... ::not opening her eyes, frowning just a little, an apprehensive look:: ... &lt;vq&gt; Wh- why did you think I might not come back, if not that reason...?

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::stammers a bit:: &lt;q&gt; I was... a little afraid you'd try to leave 'cause you th-thought it'd be b-best for me. ::you know, and Alfons. I said I'd make it work. ;_;::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::tries to force the corners of her mouth up to a smile, failing rather spectacularily in the process, eyes still closed and now tears are seeping out:: &lt;vq&gt; N-no... I... I w- would have come back to l- let you tell me if that was the case, and not... not assume to decide that's what you meant... that- that's cold to do.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::wince:: &lt;q&gt; I-... I'm sorry. ::didn't mean it like that &gt;_&gt;;;;:: &lt;q&gt; You'd asked me... to -try- to... to not need you, for mine and Alfons's sake, so I gues... I guess I was a little worried. ::um. wow. now he feels about ||&lt;- that big::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... ::looks at him.. blinks:: ... &lt;vq&gt; No.. no, I didn't mean that thinking that was cold, I meant... the... if i were to assume your answer for you and leave without another word. ::like what he did::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::blinks, looking at her... then pulls her into a tight hug. words? yeah, what're those?::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::closes her eyes, leaning against him weakly and laying her head on his shoulder:: &lt;vqw&gt; I'm sorry. I'm not going anywhere you don't want me to go, I just wish the vacation were more successful. I'm sorry...

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... ::rubbing her back lightly:: &lt;vq&gt; You're home, that's what's important. You're safe here, Riza. I'll help you with whatever you want however I can, I promise.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vq&gt; I tried to forget him, a crash course of getting rid of him, I couldn't do it. I'm sorry.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::shakes his head, holding her tightly:: &lt;vq&gt; It's okay, Riza. It's okay, I promise. You're home, that's all that matters to me.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::quiet sigh, nuzzling him slowly, feeling physically exhausted from the insane roller coaster of emotions:: &lt;vq&gt; I missed you. I missed this. ... I don't know what made you decide to love me, let alone stay now, but I didn't know what I'd do if... if you didn't. ::she's not as worried about what he might or might feel as she is what he'd think, and what he might not understand; she's terrified he -doesn't- get how important he's become to her, despite everything else::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::Riza, Ed lives by that intensity in all things- he understands well what it's like for someone to be that important to him; holding her close:: &lt;q&gt; I need the people I love. 'Course I couldn't send you away.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::she's still standing upright mostly because he's holding her, she's trembling enough from the intense roller coaster ride and the sheer relief that her knees are unsteady:: &lt;vq&gt; I... can we sit down?

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::blinks, then smiles:: &lt;q&gt; Yeah. ::kisses her forehead lightly before releasing her to walk over to the couch with her::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::sinking down next to him and laying down, head on his lap, facing the room::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::blinks... then pets her hair lightly (and wtf, mun, please remember you didn't hit enter over here):: ... &lt;vq&gt; Welcome home, Riza.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vq&gt; Thank you. ... ::closes her eyes, and exhales a little shuddery breath:: &lt;vq&gt; I love you. ... I'm sorry. All considered, it was a miserable failure and a waste of time. I -tried-... I tried to just... get rid of him, get back to who I was once somehow, be someone who... who wasn't always so damn close to falling apart, and... I couldn't. All it did was... nothing. When I wasn't trying to cut away the past, I was homesick and needing you.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; Riza, I never wanted you to 'get rid of him' or be the old Lieutenant Hawkeye and completely emotionless. ::tucking a bit of her hair behind her ear:: &lt;q&gt; I just wanted Riza, and I wanted her with me, where we could take care of each other, 'cause that's what makes both of us stronger.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;vq&gt; I didn't want to be Lieutenant Hawkeye, just someone who could breathe on her own, 'cause you can't always be here.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... ::leans down, kissing her temple lightly:: &lt;vq&gt; I'm sorry I wasn't... I-... I -can- make it work. I'm sorry, those first couple days weren't very fair to you.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; but to make it work, you need me to be able to pull my own weight, it's not fair to you.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; Who says you don't, Riza? ::faint smile:: &lt;q&gt; I don't think you're as weak as you think you are. I trust your aim, Riza.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vq&gt; I say I don't... I wasn't as fine with things as I should have been after I talked to Alfons, his answer was what we were hoping for and I still... That wasn't how I should be.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; That entire situation wasn't how it should've been, and that was my fault. I'm sorry.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vq&gt; There's more than just you here. 

<b>Ed&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; I know. But I'm the one in the middle, so to speak. I should've done things differently.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... ::pushes herself up, looking at him:: ... &lt;q&gt; You did what you could at the time. ... but that's what I meant, I need to... be more too, somehow. ... I was... I'm sorry. ::closes her eyes, laying her head on his shoulder::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::blinks; honestly is not sure what she thinks she did wrong... slips his arm around her:: &lt;vq&gt; Riza? Talk to me?

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; I just wanted to come back to you less... broken. This is going to be strange enough new territory on its own without worrying about everything else too.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; I don't think you're broken, Riza. ::looking at her a second:: &lt;q&gt; What exactly happened that made you think that?

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; what do you mean, what happened? I thought it was a pretty general agreement of, well, everything.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::blinking, looking at her...:: &lt;q&gt; I... I don't... I guess I don't think you're as broken as you think you are, Riza. Did something happen that day that I missed that... that made you think like this?

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; I... it's just that... everything that happened was a hell of my own making. It was all my decisions, my choices, my fault. Not his. And even knowing that I still lean toward making those same mistakes. And I don't know how to live with them. And when I try, it just... ::tiny shrug::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; It had been my fault, too. I just... wanted my mother back. And I nearly got Al killed. I wouldn't have been able to move at all after that if not for Al. That's the thing, Riza, you don't do it alone. That's... why you have me. Me and Jean and Geoff. No matter what else we are, we're your friends, and your family.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... ... &lt;vq&gt; I know. Something reminded me of you two, back then... and... and I realized... that feeling of... that overwhelming intensity of wishing for the clock to turn back and it's all a bad dream, you probably knew that. ... and you two, two children at the time, were handling it far better than a grown woman and a combat vet.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... ::shakes his head:: &lt;q&gt; Grief over losing a loved one doesn't change between children and adults. Some things change, but that's not one of them.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; And we only handled anything after we realized how wrong we were for trying to bring her back because we weren't alone.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; He didn't die. He left and it was my fault.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::closes his eyes, biting back a sigh; shakes his head:: &lt;q&gt; No, Riza. He has fault too. Nobody spoke, nobody said anything. Al and I don't always either, but... we're better about it. We split apart for a little while because we couldn't -say- some things. Winry got after both of us for it.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vq&gt; What was he -supposed- to say? I was supposed to be strong for him, he needed me more than ever then and I couldn't and I was never as strong as I looked so I probably looked like I just quit on him. I walked away, *I* left, I abandoned him. It doesn't matter what I -intended- just what I did.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; He could've asked you -why-. He could've kept after you, he could've NOT been so wrapped up in everything that he didn't stop to notice anything was wrong.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; That was not ONLY your fault. Not by a long shot.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;vq&gt; I don't know what to think of any of it and I'm sorry. ::closing her eyes, shaking her head:: you're very tired of this topic, I'm sure, and I certainly don't blame you. I've been gone for two weeks and... ::shrugs and shakes her head, sniffling as she moves to lay her head back down on his lap::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ... Hey. ::squeezing her shoulder lightly:: &lt;q&gt; The topic's open as long as you -need-. What matters is helping you, not anything else.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::staring at the wall, her head on his lap, thinking... what IS there to talk about in all that? Telling a current lover how she's either still in love with her ex or just addicted to him and sometimes she hates him because she feels like he left her and the rest of the time she just hates herself because of how much she probably hurt him?::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::... yes?::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::like he -wants- to hear about Roy, especially in her first hour back after being gone two weeks. right; shakes her head after a moment - nevermind, don't need it, I'm home now, that's what matters::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::petting her hair, frowning...:: &lt;q&gt; You can talk to me, you know.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;q&gt; I know. ... don't worry, Edward. I'm not so far gone that I'd make you put up with me talking about him within an hour of being home again. 

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::quiet a second, watching her:: &lt;q&gt; Sit up a second?

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... ::pushes herself up and looks at him::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::reaches out and slips his arms around her shoulders, pulling her over onto his lap- yes, just bodily pulled her onto his lap, why? XD;;; holds her tightly:: &lt;vq&gt; Riza? I'm your friend, and your family, first and foremost. Only thing I'm concerned with right now is that you're home, and that you need me right now. For two weeks I've missed you and wanted you home and I hated knowing you were trying to face all that alone. It's okay, I promise.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::makes a bitty surprised squeak sound when he pulls her over, then settles down, snuggling to him and resting her head on his shoulder, nuzzling his neck:: ... ... ;_;! &lt;3 ... &lt;vq&gt; Heh. ::sniffle:: ... what exactly I did to deserve it, I don't have a clue, but... ::sighs:: ... &lt;q&gt; Nutshell summary, I do and don't love him and do and don't hate him, and it's all kind of tangled together in a vicious circle.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::petting her hair as he holds her listening to her... yes, he's a little bothered by Roy being a subject, but he KNOWS it's a subject she needs to talk about in order to let him go so she can be happy, and her happiness = more important than anything else:: ... ::rubs her back, unsure at first what to say- the mun is poking him, so more to come::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> &lt;q&gt; I... I'm not sure that it's that comparable, but... ::small sigh:: &lt;q&gt; My father's abandoned me twice now. I can't really hate him, but it's hard not to sometimes. I think angry is a better word for it, really. There's... they say there's a pretty thin line between love and hate, and I guess I can believe that. It... it takes time. And you hadn't really tried to move forward, not really, not until a little bit ago. ::kisses her forehead:: &lt;q&gt; It hurts, but it's a path that -can- be walked. It's okay to feel the way you do right now.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::nuzzles him, eyes closed:: &lt;vq&gt; I don't even know if this is actually love anymore, or just an addiction, or a fear of shifting a universe around to a new center. And I want to... I wonder why he didn't come after me, why everyone else, all my alternates, -they're- with him and why wasn't *I* good enough, and then I remember that how it must have seemed to him and all I can think about is how horribly I failed him for how much that hurt, and then I wonder if even hurt him at all or if he even remembers me and then it's all back to where I started.

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::kisses her forehead:: &lt;vq&gt; It's terrifying, leaving everything you ever knew for something new. ::quiet, thinking a second:: &lt;q&gt; I don't think it's that you weren't good enough, Riza. In fact, I know it wasn't. Because I still see too much worth in you for it to have been that. What happened was you both got scared and stopped talking.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ... &lt;vqw&gt; Maybe... ::nuzzles his cheek, sighs:: &lt;vq&gt; I'm sorry, this must all sound very bad. It doesn't really matter, the whys or anything. Just the whats, and what the facts are is that it's over, and I do know I love you and I need -you-. 

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::oh, Riza, that does his heart good XD;;; tilts his head a little and kisses her firmly, sliding one hand up her back to tangle in her hair- what, him? Possessive? never::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::itty bitty whimper as she kisses him back, slipping her arms around him to cling tight, a desperate intensity the kiss - oh, but how she did miss him and she's home and he's there and he still wants her and he's not leaving::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::and once she's kissing him back, he shivers and kisses her more firmly, more possessively- she's home, she's here, she's -his- and back and god he missed her::

<b>Riza&gt;</b> ::shifts on his lap a bit to face him more fully, craving this, that feeling of being wanted, needed, and home, holding onto him like hell itself couldn't break her away, kissing him, nibbling his lips, whispering his name in between, it's -him- now, she knows who she's kissing, who she's with, where home is::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::good, because he's not about to let her forget and you can damn well bet he's going to make this home as perfect as he can for her; holding her tightly once she resettles herself, nipping at her lips lightly:: &lt;vqw&gt; I love you.

<b>Riza&gt;</b> &lt;vqw&gt; I love you too... ::opening her eyes... looking at him... and a quiet sort of tranquility comes over her expression, a peaceful little look of happiness, weary, but nevertheless soft and genuine::

<b>Ed&gt;</b> ::sliding his hands up to cup her face gently; kisses her reverently a couple times:: &lt;vq&gt; I've missed you. &lt;3"

Roy,

You were the center of my universe, and I think perhaps you still are. Maybe you always will be. I don't know if I'll ever give you this letter -- if I'll choose to, if I'll have the chance, or what. But I need to talk to you. I've needed to talk to you. And looking back over all the years, perhaps I should have said more.

But it's too little, too late, isn't it? <lj-cut>

I miss you. I've missed you for what's feeling like forever and a day now. And I love you. I think part of me always will. I'd built my life with you as the heart, the center, the soul. When you left, you took those with you.

But I have got to let go of them, of you, and go on. I want to come back, I won't lie on that. I do. Maybe I will, if my worst fears are realized here, and I find I have no true home to return once I go back. But I know I can't, that I shouldn't. Because if I go back, there's nothing I wouldn't do to earn your forgiveness, to be taken back. Sitting here now, it's a frightening thought to realize that I would put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger if you told me that's what it would take to make things better. That's how much I need you.

Even I can see that's not healthy. You're an addiction, a drug, and I need you. I'm not even sure if this is what love is anymore. I'm not sure if what I feel is addiction or love, or just a bone-deep terror at letting go of everything I ever wished for and taking a new road.

I never meant to abandon you, but intentions count for little in the end. I never did tell you anything; I was too afraid to, afraid to let anyone know or see that I wasn't really as strong as I seemed. And I know you would have tried to fix things and I couldn't bring myself to put anything else on you -- there was already so much, so many burdens I could see pulling you down, especially after he died, and I tried to fill that empty space left the best I could as well and I couldn't justify putting any more problems on you. I was supposed to support you -- support is supposed to be strong, isn't it? And I couldn't let anyone else see either, because you needed me to be strong, so I thought.

I suppose it must have come as a terrible shock to realize I wasn't strong, when I finally cracked under the weight of the realization that the person you needed to be protected from all along had been me. And you left. You left me for abandoning you. And I didn't follow, because I couldn't see where you didn't have full right to blame and hate me for what happened. I still can't, truth be told. I think you're well in your right to hate me now. 

And I miss you. The bitterest pill to swallow is the knowledge that all of this? Is my fault. The mess my life became? My choices led me there. And I failed you. Worst of all, I'm not really sure what I could have done differently. Would you have understood if I showed you how weak I was under all those masks? Or would it have brought you down?

I have to let you go, and find a way to live without a heart and soul -- or find new ones. Because I can't tell if this is love anymore, or fear. And there's someone who I hope will still need me, who I'm trying to trust enough to take the weight of things while trying not to be scared to death if there's too much, it'll take us both down. 

I thought I'd feel better getting this out on paper. To tell you these things, to say goodbye. Instead, I just feel sick. And I want to run back now but I can't, I won't. I'd lose what little respect for myself I might still retain. I have to prove to myself I can breathe on my own, if only for a little while, and I don't think I can. 

I'm sorry. You depended on me. You chose the wrong person. I just wish I could have been who you believed me to be.

Always and never,
- Riza"

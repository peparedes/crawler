"event","Sorry I haven't been updating on my pregnancy as of late... I've been working alot and just trying to rest as much as possible lately... but tonight, (it's actually 5 am) I can't sleep, so my insomnia is bring on a baby blog...

Benjamin is looking very healthy... James and I went for a ultrasound today and was advised that he has a full head of hair already... that he is 6.35lbs... ohh did I mention we have another 4 weeks until my official due date... he's gonna be huge by then. 

My Drs finally decided that the edema in my feet and hands, as well as erradict blood pressure warranted bed rest, and officially put me on leave from work... though I am only mildly excited about that, since I had already planned on working the three remaining shifts I was already scheduled for this week, using up my vacation days this weekend, and starting my leave monday regardless...

We didn't even need to bring it up to the doctors... my blood pressure had become increasing erradic during my last 2 appointments and I can only guess that this third was the kicker for them.  (At the appointment last week, my blood pressure started out somewhere around 138 over something or another and was down to 118 by my second reading 15 mins later)...

Not to mention the swelling in my feet is pretty horrendous... I usuallu wear a size 6 or 6.5 but have been squeezing into a 8.5 wide just to go to work, and find that by the middle of shift, my feet are too swollen even for those to be comfortable... This swelling doesn't stop at the feet and ankles... My entire leg is swollen up to my knees.. beyond my knees I can't really tell what is swelling and what isn't... but lets just assume that its the entire leg, since the knees are very obviously swollen... The same swelling has also caused my right hand to have carple tunnel (though this form corrects itself after the baby is born)... I can not tell you how aggravating it is to lose dexterity and feeling in your right hand.... especially if you are a righty... and I don't just lose it from tiem to time... my right hand feels like it is frost bit all day, everyday... for at least the the past 3 weeks... I can't tell you the number of times I have stopped and touched my hand just to make sure it really isn't cold, because it truly feels like it is frozen... and at night the left hand isn't much better... as the swelling tries to disapate from my legs, it spreads to my hands, thus causing the other problems I've listed...

YES I AM OVER BEING PREGNANT... I am so over it... Making it worse is the countless people... or shall i say STRANGERS on the street who stop to talk to me or touch my belly.  The last time I felt like I had zero personal space in public like this I was at a bar in college, and the boys were getting too fresh on the dance floor... seriously people.... why must everyone stop and touch it.  I know the belly is big and round... and yes i am very aware that I am pregnant...

The top things that are discussed (when my belly isn't being rubbed by strangers)
* They argue that I am having a girl, and not a boy (even though the ultrasounds make it very clear that he has a penis)
* I am told that I am about to pop any second (though I have heard this for the last 4 weeks and I am still waiting for that one)
* I am told that my belly has dropped... or rather is ""dropping again"" (though this was told to me by a co worker... and you can't drop AGAIN.... plus I just confirmed with my OB yesterday, Ben hasn't dropped yet...)

I know I am bitching alot here... I don't mean to... I just know that a few of you that I am friends with a Pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant, and I thought I'd share with you the annoying aspects of it... just so you have some idea of what you are in for...

Not everyone has these horrible experiences by the way... and it isn't all bad... infact, though BEnjamin is running out of room in my tummy, and his kicking can be annoying (b/c he is getting stronger) I really enjoy feeling him kick, punch, and move around... and if I could just convince him to wiggle his tushie out of the left side of my rib cage, I would be completely happy

It's nice knowing that I can talk to him now and that he has no choice but to listen... and that from what I hear, he wants to listen. 

Concerts are also fun... James and I went to see a show a couple of weekends ago and it was fun knowing that ""I Am The Avalanche"" was one of Benjamin's first shows he got to hear... I'm pretty sure he couldn't hear Coheed a few months ago...(I'm also planning on going the night of the baby shower to see Tegan and Sara... as well as to the rescheduled Coldplay outdoor concert this spring in Tampa after he is born... most likely being his first concert ever...

I've also been enjoying putting together his baby stuff with James... with the baby shower being this weekend, the presents have begun to come in...  and I now know why my Dad kept a stockpile of batteries around the house when we were growing up... everything takes batteries... I am seriously considering buying stock in duracell or at the very least buying a shit ton of rechargables...

okay enough ranting... I'm pretty sure I've typed the insomnia out of me for at least an hour or 2... If I think of more, I will write another post..."

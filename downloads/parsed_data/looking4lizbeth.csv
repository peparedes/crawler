building myself back up.

For what?
For me to stand up,

That you broke my soul a little bit,
And going back just isn't feasible.

You feel guilty?
Then feel guilty.

feel better about this mess.

of not-as-important to you,
as your everyday,
real-life,
exceptional love."

"event","Wow, so last night was rough.&nbsp; I&nbsp;got lucky that you were awake, and willing to talk.&nbsp; Your words just relax me, pull me back from the edge.&nbsp; Three hours of crying, calmed down in ten minutes.&nbsp; We have a very similar healing ability, and it strikes me how familiar your energy seems.&nbsp; I touch your hand, and it's like&nbsp;touching a mirror.&nbsp; The emotion flowing through our fingers seems to just blend and extend outward.&nbsp; I love the way you touch me,&nbsp;and heal me, and look at me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;love the way our friendship flows back and forth, from comforter to comfortee.&nbsp; I&nbsp;love that first and foremost, I consider you my friend.&nbsp; And from there, maybe it's a little complicated.&nbsp; But the support and affection I have for you seems very simple, and I appreciate that.&nbsp;

Simplicity

A look, a glance.
A chance meeting.
A solid friendship,
beginning with words.
But ending in action.
Hold me close,
chase it all away.
The cold, dark
undeserving world.
No words to paraphase,
how I should react.
Other than the obvious.
Happy non-forcing energy,
flowing from your touch.
Your lips spark a flame,
But your words start a fire.
So strong and bright,
that it chases away the dark.
Within my soul.
Within my thoughts.
I&nbsp;adore this complicated,
simplistic mess.
I'm happy to share this space,
this quiet slow existence.
This peaceful chaos,
that we both understand.
You and me,
both of us.
Alone.
Together."

"event","I sit in silence, tears streaming down my face.&nbsp; Hair falling like a curtain, blocking my view of the keys.&nbsp; My fingers flying.&nbsp; Today was a rough one.&nbsp; I&nbsp;laughed with friends, pasted a smile on my face.&nbsp; I watched a friend open gifts for her new baby girl, and I yearned.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am strong, so strong.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;am breaking inside.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am trying so hard to repair the damage that life has inflicted on my heart, and just keep moving.&nbsp; But hard requests stop the motion and the production in this love manufacturing plant.&nbsp; I had to tell him no.&nbsp; The man that I&nbsp;took vows with, the man that I&nbsp;promised to love and cherish.&nbsp; He reached out (ever so slowly) and asked me to come home.&nbsp; And there was no hesitation in my response.&nbsp; It was &quot;no.&quot;&nbsp; And the same afternoon, I&nbsp;had to block someone out someone I&nbsp;fucking adore.&nbsp; I had to cool the burning of this angry fire, and having him be a part of my life was making that impossible.&nbsp; Even as friends?&nbsp; Well, we all know that after it's over, there's no such thing.&nbsp; Not if there is this much hurt and disapointment.&nbsp; I&nbsp;see him, and I&nbsp;want to scream at him.&nbsp; Slap him.&nbsp; Tell him he's wrong, and breaking my heart.&nbsp; But he already knows that, and I'm not interested in beating on dead horses.&nbsp; 

And so I am alone.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have chosen to do this solo.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am this dependent shy little girl inside, indecisive and needy, but I&nbsp;am trying so fucking hard.&nbsp; And during the day, when I&nbsp;am surrounded by the sunlight, I am encouraged.&nbsp; But&nbsp;at night, when I am sitting alone in this crappy little bed in the spare room, I worry.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cry.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wait for something amazing to change my heart,&nbsp;to just fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no temporary fix to where I am headed, and I am&nbsp;fucking terrified.&nbsp; It's not just about&nbsp;me this time around.&nbsp; Now I&nbsp;have this little man, who needs more than a good support system.&nbsp; He also needs clothes on his back,&nbsp;and preschool payments.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I cannot do this alone.&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp;talk a good game, but we would be close to starving.&nbsp; I&nbsp;dunno how to fix this mess, and I just don't know if I'm strong enough.&nbsp; I need answers.&nbsp;Not advice from people that think they know what's best.&nbsp; Stay here?&nbsp; Oh yeah, that's brilliant.&nbsp; Spend my life sleeping in the same home as a man I&nbsp;used to adore.&nbsp; That I&nbsp;created a life with.&nbsp; All the while, pining for someone else, but not being able to cook them a meal?&nbsp; It may be a new way of life for some blended families, but I&nbsp;am just trying to end this with everyone unscathed.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;am failing.&nbsp; 

All my supports say that it's not me.&nbsp; But it always takes two.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; And all the effort that I put in, maybe it wasn't enough to save us.&nbsp; Maybe we were never meant to be saved?&nbsp; Do I&nbsp;believe in soul mates?&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't know.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe in connection, and have experienced it a few times over this lifetime.&nbsp; Love is beautiful, and it inspires me.&nbsp; It carries me, and shows me the light and beauty of the world.&nbsp; Does it pay my bills?&nbsp; Not so much.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish life was simpler.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish love was less complicated, and when people said it, they meant it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would never hurt the ones I&nbsp;love, the way I'm hurting right now.&nbsp; I would do my best to shield them, and spare their feelings.&nbsp; And if I ever told someone that I wanted them to be holding my hand when I left this world, I&nbsp;would sure as hell mean it.&nbsp; Because you cannot say things like that, and then send a one line email saying it's over.&nbsp; You just cannot do that to someone you love.&nbsp; At least, I&nbsp;would never.&nbsp; 

I'm so exhausted, and feeling ugly. &nbsp;I'm waiting for a sign that may never come, and I'm sick of asking.&nbsp; I'm tired of chasing a dream.&nbsp; I&nbsp;just want to be happy, and breathe without this feeling of dread settling on my chest.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to wake up, and appreciate&nbsp;the beauty of the morning.&nbsp; I&nbsp;need to smile....&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","I'm tired.&nbsp; And not just the &quot;Wow, I&nbsp;was out all night and didn't get much sleep,&quot;&nbsp;kind of tired.&nbsp; I'm exhausted.&nbsp; It's more to do with waking up and knowing this person you have evolved with is not the person you walked down the aisle with 5 years ago.&nbsp; What changed?&nbsp; When did he become his father?&nbsp; Was I&nbsp;just too blind to see the arrogance staring me in the face?&nbsp; We used to laugh about it, when his father threw a fit in public, hiding because we were so embarrassed.&nbsp; Today, I&nbsp;found myself apologizing to a clerk for the way&nbsp;you reacted.&nbsp; And then you continued that rant on us.&nbsp; And I just laughed, to keep from crying.&nbsp; I just don't know what to do.&nbsp; 

I see&nbsp;my little man&nbsp;growing up, mirroring that behavior, and I'm afraid.&nbsp; It's not that he is a bad man...by any means.&nbsp; But there's a huge amount of space between &quot;bad man&quot;&nbsp;and &quot;genuine and loving.&quot;&nbsp; When we decided to separate, it seemed like the idea of people finding out was more important than that fact I&nbsp;was saying, &quot;I&nbsp;don't want to be with you anymore.&quot;&nbsp; We even lied to his parents when they came for a visit, trying our best to act like a normal couple.&nbsp; Not that they'd recognize that anyway...

I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;am leading two lives.&nbsp; In one, I&nbsp;am responsible.&nbsp; A good mother, doing what I&nbsp;must.&nbsp; Cooking and cleaning, and working in my gardens.&nbsp; In the other, I&nbsp;am alive.&nbsp; I'm drinking, and socializing.&nbsp; And even falling in-love.&nbsp; It's all just a bit over the top, and I think it's taking some toll.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am trying so hard to keep up, and make everyone happy.&nbsp; Trying to meet the needs of everyone, and not let anyone down.&nbsp; One aspect of my life is easy.&nbsp; One person who expects nothing but my smile.&nbsp; And I am beyond thankful for that little break in reality.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have no idea where I&nbsp;am, or what it all means...but for the first time, that doesn't seem so important.&nbsp; It seems wrong, to even think ahead.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am a control freak, with absolutely no desire to control.&nbsp; Eek!&nbsp; 

I'm listening to a lot of music from the past.&nbsp; I'm saying what I&nbsp;mean.&nbsp; I'm taking chances.&nbsp; And so far, so good.&nbsp; Last night, a guy bought my girlfriends and I a round of drinks, because I&nbsp;struck up a conversation and wasn't afraid to say hello.&nbsp; Two years ago, I would have refused the drink.&nbsp; It's amazing what happens, when you open yourself up for what life has to offer.&nbsp; Close your eyes, and place your hands on either side of your eyes.&nbsp; Open your peepers, and focus on what's right in front of you.&nbsp; Now take away the blinders.&nbsp; Lower your hands, and peer from the left to the right.&nbsp; Look how much further your horizon expands.&nbsp; See the beauty in the details, and tell someone.&nbsp; Talk to the people that love you.&nbsp; Don't stay angry.&nbsp; And if you feel for someone....tell them.&nbsp; It's amazing what can happen, when you open yourself up to the light.&nbsp; Appreciate the simple things, and take time to smile.&nbsp; With your smile, you may even set someone else free..."

I&nbsp;went looking for a distraction, and I&nbsp;found....this.&nbsp; What is this?&nbsp; It's comfort.&nbsp; I know you're there, and that's pretty much enough for me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;keep moving along, driving down the road.&nbsp; Through the tunnels, that run the length of mountains.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;come out the other side squinting from the brightness of all this light.&nbsp; Sometimes the reality gets in the way, but maybe that's life.&nbsp; That's the hard truth.&nbsp; We can't have what we want all the time, but we can almost hope that we'll get what we need.&nbsp; In example...I&nbsp;had this dove once.&nbsp; The most majestic creature, full of pride and beauty.&nbsp; The time came to set it free, and I did just that.&nbsp; Because it's true, we cannot keep what does not belong to us.&nbsp; And we cannot force someone to stay...to love...to be the things that we should find within ourselves.&nbsp; And so I'm sleeping alone.&nbsp; I'm waking up every single morning cold.&nbsp; And I am hating it.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;have small flashes of comfort, mixed with this overall feeling of okay.&nbsp; And it's getting me through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

It all seems so fast, and I'm a bit dazed.&nbsp; But as I sit and really ponder, in my&nbsp;spiritual reality...it's not fast at all.&nbsp; It's like all this time, there has been a lot of sitting&nbsp;and waiting.&nbsp; And it chose this precise moment to jump out and say, &quot;Gotcha!&quot;&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; Because at this precise moment, we're both pretty overwhelmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the chaos that exists in each of our realities, and neither of us has a thing to do with the others.&nbsp; And that, is comfort.&nbsp; That is just perfect.&nbsp; And that's what you are to me.&nbsp; Just this perfect silence.&nbsp; This&nbsp;being of non-judging sweetness.&nbsp; It's here, in that quiet space...in your arms, that&nbsp;I can finally breathe."

"event","&nbsp;Silence and regrets, wrapping me up like a blanket.&nbsp; It's soft and comfortable here...living in a dark room, with the lights turned off.&nbsp; Talking to your back, I can hear your sighing.&nbsp; I begin to cry and you don't notice.&nbsp; I feel like a prisoner.

I love you, but not like this.&nbsp; Not in this way, where I can't breathe.&nbsp; There's is not one ounce of respect in this union.&nbsp; You say I don't listen, I say you don't hear me.&nbsp; And when I open my mouth, you treat me like it's a hassle.&nbsp; You don't touch me, and&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;it's a ""production"" to make love.&nbsp; I say you're fucking lazy.&nbsp; You say you have no control, but I feel smothered by your controlling hand.&nbsp; It didn't used to be like that.&nbsp; You were not a control freak.&nbsp; Did I do something to make you feel as if you should be husband AND my father?&nbsp; I'm not sure when that began, but I cannot deal.&nbsp; You speak down to me in front of our son, calling me ""retarded"" and ""acting crazy,"" and when I cry, Tommy says, ""I love you mama.""

When did I become this woman?&nbsp; When did I become so weak and powerless?&nbsp; You say I control everything about our life, then why do I feel like I'm drowning in a lack of being included?&nbsp; You say, ""I'm the man, and no one listens to me.""&nbsp; Why does your being a man mean we HAVE to?&nbsp; I didn't marry a chauvinist, so did I help create one?&nbsp;&nbsp;

I don't want a broken home for my family.&nbsp; I want to work on things, and get my life back in track.&nbsp; But I CANNOT live without human touch.&nbsp; I thrive on that connection, and you are slowly killing me.&nbsp; You tell me to see a therapist to ""work through my issues,"" like I am the only broken one in the equation.&nbsp; I fear if I see a therapist, I will find the courage to leave you.

It seems every time I take two steps forward, someone keeps dragging me back to the starting line.&nbsp; I am SICK of playing this game, and I am so very tired.&nbsp; I'm just done."

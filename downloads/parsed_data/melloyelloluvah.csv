"event","Ok...so I've finally nailed it on the head...and I don't know why I had a ""total eclipse of the heart"" over you.  I've gone over it and over it, I can't figure why it's been so hard.  If I really was in love with you, why can't I seem to pinpoint why I was?  But why would this have been so hard and frustrating if I did not love you.  AHHH!  It kills me.  It really does.  To be over you SO completely, but to have these traces of you like dried scars, waiting to be removed.  It feels like I will never be completely freed from you, until I have answered all my burning questions, freed all of my regret, and heartache.  I told you such a simplified version of the truth only to not overwhelm you with so much emotion.  I dont think you care...I dont think you've even noticed my absence.  Truth is, you couldnt be happier.  You have everything you ever wanted.  This was kind of how i felt at the start of this year. I felt like everything was perfect.  I had all these starry dreams lining up...and you seemed to be lining up...and one by one everything crashed....and yeah I'm OVER you...or whatever that was...but I am not over the domino effect.  These weights that have slowly toppled over me.  And the one person who I could turn to before is gone.  That's the difference...and it makes all the difference.
I feel like you were a fake.  Pretending that I meant so much to you....As a friend is still just as genuine.  I thought.  I didnt need to be your everything...at the time I knew I wasnt.  But I knew I was your best friend, so close...so I thougt.  A friendship that could withstand everything.  And she says she feels bad...but she doesnt.  At least if she had, she would have kept her lust in check a long time ago.  So now it doesnt matter how much she cares, or feels bad...I hope she feels the guilt... because now its too late.
I see you with everyone else...and I am gone...out of the picture.  Vanished...like I was nothing.  It would have been better if you hadn't of told me, you said.  Right.  I said...if I could only go back.  And I'd go back farther than that too believe me."

First, there are the twins, Paige and Jammie, who are 6, with the brightest blue eyes ever.  They are always climbing all over me, and hugging me, and sitting by me...and then my newest friend Sarah, who is eight.  She is so precious, but she is a little drama queen.  She had a part in the christmas play and she was like, ""I can't go up there, because I will mess up, and everyone will laugh at me...""  she was so sad, so I helped her with her part.  She broke my heart like 4.5 times.  One time she said to me,  ""I love you Melissa.  I wish my mom was like you."" Awww.  She had just met me earlier that day.  That just shows you amazing and full of love kids really are.  It kills me to see children that can't or dont know how to let that love out.

"event","Ok, so my paper journal isnt lacking, but this one is definately suffocating from lack of writing to it's e-pages.  It's like not walking for weeks or something.  I havent written in months so its even worse.  

I guess we can blame the livejournal.com people, for when at random points this summer, I DID try to log on and dutifully write in my journal, the blog was shut down for repairs or experiencing some information highway pit stop.

Regardless of why I haven't written, it still doesnt change the fact that, hey...I havent written.  So that's that.


So yeah, pretty run of the mill....I have incredible housemates for the summer, some that have become life-friends made by that simple but ever present and indestructable bond that is our Lord Jesus Christ.  Ari (one of them) and I have started singing at Beatniks (a local coffee house/bar) and have started reaching people on that level.  I feel drawn to these hurting people much more than the people of this campus who know the truth and live like they have eternity on this earth.  Both environments both sadden and excite me with the possibility of God's affect in these arenas.

Took of most of July for some serious QT with the family for a week, then on to a trekking and BACKPACKING trip in Montana that BOOSTED my life 100 % by simply showing me more beauty then I could contain in 7 rolls of film...alas if only I had taken more pictures.  July rocked the socks off if you know now.

Since June and my forging of the forever friends/housemates I have been on several road trips to Michigan and Fort Wayne...and other places in Michigan.   It has been so much fun...also had opportunities to meet several new guys, go on some summer dates, and enjoy the fact that I am still a woman, which I often forget in the dead of winter.  

Music has been running fresh, meeting up with cousin chad for some jamming and seeing family has also been an extra that I have RELISHED.   I did not however enjoy missing my grandma and my aunt Jan's joint birthday party.  Grrrr.

I have made a couple mixes of music...properly labeled...I hate boys and I love Men....two very contrasting, opposite cd's but both put me in a great mood, not to mention my soon to be cult classic, ""Mountain Climbin' Fun"" formulated especially for my family and our adventures in the mountains.

I've seen SO many movies also...everything from Spiderman 2, to the ever-pressing, well-written, over-glorified-by- women movie:  The Notebook...notorious for it's sap.   But of course, I loved it.  

Been hit on...surprise but always appreciated...

Some new developments spiritually...

I am craving not to be filled with emotion, but to be filled with presence...to be never satisfied with monotony and complacency...to have a raging fire and not a constant burning...to see my first love... (Rev. 2)  I have given the battle axe of begrudging, bitter love away and am now working at was at the root of my problem:  trust.  I crave constant state of mind that is entrenched in prayer and praise...and I long for Christ...and not earthly love.

Of course...I dont turn away the earthly praise or anything...but I am careful and discerning in all my transaction with the opposite sex...at least I strive to be.

I have been working at Housekeeping all summer which has been both a torturous and wonderous experience, wrapped in tons of gossip that I can no longer tolerate.  It is probably the most stress-inducing job I have ever held, and yet it is the most easy task-wise.  I have gone through so many misunderstandings and heartaches at this job but I have learned to fight for my rights, and not to be trampled on.  More importantly, I have expressed an urge to clear up misunderstandings and keep on going until it is right again with the world.  Despite the things I have learned, and the friendships I have gained...I am counting down the two weeks I have remianing...and I am never coming back!  PLEASE NO....:)

My best friend Melissa is coming to IWU this fall...super-charged and excited about that, and also my cousin Mary-Sue is coming...and I am pumped beyond belief.  

God is awesome...whenever these little bumps may sail under our tires, we must remember that throughout...stay the course...God is the road...we only need follow...we will reach the top of the mountain...to see his wonderous plans stretch out before us following the reaching fingers of the Son."

"event","OK, so on Wednesday, my Uncles Dale and Ron came to Marion to give a talk, so they, my Uncle Tom, my cousins Chad and Abby, and Chad's two friends, Josh and Grant all went to a restaurant called La Chareada's.   I rode with Abby, Uncle Dale and Uncle Ron.  As we are pulling into the parking lot, I see this yellow sports car, and two guys are standing up next to it.  Within minutes, a car pulls up and the two guys lean into the window...and it looks kinda shady, so I jokingly say to my uncles, ""Hey guys, It's a drug deal.""   They of course ignore me.  Later we are in the restaurant and I tell my uncle Tom.  We both watch as another car pulls up to the yellow car, and the two guys lean in.  My Uncle Tom goes,  ""Hey you guys, maybe she's right.  That's the second car!""  Well I watched as 2 more cars pull up before I finally tap my Uncle and I say, ""You know...I think it is our civil duty to call the cops and at least tell them that something suspicious is going on.""   Of course they all laugh and ignore me.  So I ask, ""DO you know if this restaurant has a bathroom or a pay phone.""   THey think this is hilarious because they don't know that I needed to go to the bathroom and call the cops.  They thought I was just saying random things.  Well I went to the bathroom and on the way back I called the Cops.  This is what I said,  ""Hi, I don't want to make this bigger than it is or anything, but there is some suspicious behavior next to the parking lot of La Chareada's""  and she asked me to explain it, so I said, ""There is a yellow car and maybe a black truck and a motorcycle, and they have been parked there for a couple hours, and every once in a while, a car will pull up and two guys will come over to the car and lean into it, and then they will drive away and another car will pull up.""  And she said, ""Kinda looks like a drug deal?""  and I said, ""I guess.""  so she said, ""Sure I'll send a squad car right away.""  
So I go sit down at the table and I don't say anything.  I figured they would think I overeacted or think I was stupid, so I don't say anything.  Well about ten minutes later, two squad cars race by the window and Grant says, ""Woah, there goes two police cars.""  Well they pull into the parking lot, and I just sit there and watch as they get out, search the cars, and pat down the people. THey even call in a third car. 
Finally, UNcle Tom notices and turns to me and says, ""Hey look, looks like someone called the police before you did.""  and I just kinda smile, and he says, ""You didn't call the police did you?""  and I laugh, and I'm like,  ""No!""  but then when everyone lost interest, I said, ""Yeah, ok, I did.""  Then Grant said, ""Did you really call the police?""  and I was like, ""Yeah, I did.""  and he was like, ""Wow.  I'm impressed.""

And that impressed me, because I thought they would all make fun of me.  

Anyway...then we went to pay, and by the time we got back, they were all gone.  So I missed what happened.  Oh well."

I thought of how we used to be the best of friends, how we used to laugh at everything together, how we had a pact to always help eachother up the chain of success. How I loved you, in the most innocent way a little high school girl could.  How sometimes when I look out into a starry sky, or  watch a movie, I still love you.  Not in the way I did before...no...but in a caring, forever friendship sort of way... and I don't miss loving you, it's better this way, but I miss the close friendship we shared, to be so close, to not worry about awkwardness, or being able to hug eachother and never worry the other might take it the wrong way.

I want to pray that I do not get my hope up about this position so that if I do not recieve it, I will be hurt by this.

Also, I need to keep in perspective that if it doesnt work out, I still will room with Melissa and have a great time.

"event","This morning Stephanie's 1 year old neice Kinsen came over so we could watch her while Steph was in class.  At first she was kind of cranky, and I had been asleep when Steph had dropped her off so she was really uncertain of me.  Janai was holding her and trying to entertain her, but it wasn't working.  So, I put on my bee hat and did a little dance for her.  But she didnt seem to react much to that.  She stopped crying but she was looking at me like...""Who is that?""  Well than I wrote her a song on guitar and she just kept looking at me really strange, but she was really quiet and cute.  Well than, I am like..well she hates me,but she's quiet,so it works.  BUt than whenever I left, she would start crying, and when I went to take ashower I left the door open so she wouldnt think I was gone, but I heard her crying, so I started singing the song I wrote for her.  It was funny.  Well than later, at like 12 I took her back to our room because Stephanie and Janai both had classes.  It was so cute, she fell asleep against me and it was adorable.  When she woke up, she didnt even cry and she watched Veggie Tales and snuggled with me.  She was so sweet and cute.  It made me want kids.  :)"

"event","Here's the thing.  My dad has a disease called MS...and he has a mild form of it which involves him going through periods of time, where there are mild symptoms but basically a remission from problems.  Than he will have an attack, which is when his disease is at the most dangerous place.  This is when the body is more susceptible to disease, illness, and worsening symptoms.  This is also where some symptoms that were temporary before can become permanent.  Right now he is having an attack, and he hasnt had one in four years...ever since our family took a vacation to Tennessee.


It's weird, because all of my old fears as a child are coming back.  I know this isn't terminal but I still am worried about him, because if he were to catch the wrong thing, it could be bad. 


PLease pray for him, and Alyssa, you can tell the rest of your family, but I am nto sure if the rest of our fam knows, or if my Dad is going to tell everyone yet...so mention that before you say anything."

It wasn't the frigid,icy air of last week, but a soft, cool breeze.  I could smell the faint scent of spring clinging to it's hemline, and the stars shone a sweet foreboding to my eyes.  

I felt a peace, as my troubled, busy, stress engrossed mind ambled over my agendas and duties, and criss-crossed life.  I felt it all like a slate being wiped away.  Replaced with a clear shining sense of renewal and hope.
  
Oh God, I cried to the wind,Only You know my heart so deeply.  Know my worries, my fears, my doubts and my insecurities.  Who am I to not think you can handle me.  Why do I always seek to control my own life.

"event","I thought about writing an article for Magazine Writing entitled: ""I live to swim""  but this past week I didn't get to swim because Abby couldn't go with me and I didn't really want to go alone.  Well this morning I went with Abby and I can't explain the utter joy of it.  As I cut through the thick water, and felt it rush over my skin and body I felt elated.   Belonged.  That probably is not the right form of that word, but I like it.   I felt like I belonged in the water,it belonged to me, and I belonged.  When I type it thatmuch I kind of lose the sense of the word.  It's already starting to look like gibberish.  But anyway.  

I startd thinking over the past week and how it had been entirely hectic and crazy and I began to realize a couple of things.  When I swim, not only do I feel healthier, and maintain my weight, I also seem to be more organized, more on the ground, and more happy.  I have to wake up early so I force myself to start the day.  I get more things done, I am energized and I start out the day on a kick.

So I decided that yes, I do live to swim, because I love it thatmuch.  But more importantly, I swim to live.  I depend on swimming to help me through the day and it helps me live a better, more focused, purpose driven life.   By the way that is a good book i hear."

She Walks in Beauty

She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies,
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to the tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

One ray the more, one shade the less
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress
Or softly lightens o'er her face,
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling place.

And on that cheek and o'er that brow
So soft, so calm yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow
But tell of days in goodness spent
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent"

"event","Tonight was one of those spontaneous do whatever nights.  I slept until forever because I stayed up late watching a movie with Rachel Wesseling.  Love her.  Than at about 6, I went to the student center to eat, because I hadn't eaten anything, and i was hungry.  I ran into Charissa Gast while I was there, and I got some food and started talking to her, and than Paul Kind came over and ate and talked with us.  I kept talking about my sisters the whole time!  It was fun though.  

Well after that about 8 or so, I went over to this group of people who were playing cards.  I had met one of them, a girl named Jo, but I didn't know the other 3.  Soon, I was playing cards with them.  There names were Aaron, Adam, and David.  So we played BS Chinese Style...which I liked a lot, and it was my first time.  Than we went over to the coffee shop at 9 to watch the concert.  We played ERS and Euker while we watched him.  He was good.

Than I challenged the guys to a game of pool, and Adam said he would play me, so we went and played pool.  The first game I beat him.  Hahahaha.  The second game he beat me, but not badly because I had only two balls left.  He said he felt satisfied and didn't need a tie breaker.  But I think he was just scared.  :)

Than when the game room closed, we left with a girl named Laura Rahke.  She was really nice and I started talking to her, but I think the other guys already knew her or something.

I went to get a strawberry orange creamsicle, and I ran into Rachel W. again.  She asked me to go bowling, and than her brother asked David and Adam and Aaron to come too.  But Adam and Aaron and Laura wanted to go to Taco Bell so we went.  

Well taco bell had a huge line, so we went to Walmart, where we proceeded to follow Adam around until he had gotten enough food to eat.  It was pretty funny.  

Than we walked out to the parking lot and looked at the moon.  It was really romantic.  

Well actually we just didnt know where else to go.  So we decided to go to David's apartment and watch a movie or something, but when we got there, someone else was watching a movie.  So we played another game of BS Chinese Style.  I really like that game.  I think that it is tied with Poker games as my new game to play.  I can't wait to teach Janai and Stephanie and Dan.  BUt anyway.   We played that and than everyone started to say they were ready to go.

Adam and his two friends were getting up to go, and than Laura said she was ready to go, and than David was like, ok...well I guess we'll call it a night. It was about 2:30. I could have played more though.  I love that game.

So than I walked home.  The clouds had dissapeared from around the moon, and now the stars shone everywhere.  I kind of laughed at myself.  I hadn't known any of those people, and yet I had spent all night, about 6-7 hours with them.  It was also really ironic, because although I have done stuff like that before, I had usually been more of me before.  This time, I was so quiet, and timid.  But it helped me win a couple games of BS.  SO whatever works.  ;)   Whether I was loud, quiet, outgoing, or timid, I had a really great time.  

It was a fun night."

"event","I want to feel beautiful.  Not just to me.  I mean, I can honestly say I feel beautiful 99% of the time, and this is a new development.  Relatively.  One that I am enjoying.  After my ""beauty revolution""  I had no problem whatsoever looking in the mirror, because I was overjoyed with the God-shining, God-loves me beauty that I saw all over my face.  It was relief, it was like breathing again, but in a way I had never known how to breathe before.  It was as if I could suddenly breathe under water--something I always wanted to do but could never accomplish.  Finally, after a whole lifetime of trying, I saw myself as beautiful.  I still do, and it's great.  

But that's not what I am talking about.  

I decided when I was 17, ending with Sebastian, that I was done with that stereotypical, teeny bopper way of dating, and that I wanted to be so satisfied with God, that when the right guy comes along I won't even be looking.  It will just happen.  And so far, that has worked.  When I was younger I used to look at practically every guy and wonder if he was the one.  Now, I don't.  I don't even look for guys.  Honestly, I don't think I want a boyfriend, and I don't feel ready.  I'm too scared of laying myself vulnerable in that kind of way.  It's so strange, because I strip myself bare on so many other things.

BUT that's not really what I am talking about either.  I don't feel like I NEEED a guy now, or that I NEEED someone to think I am beautiful....
     It is more like a desire to be cherished.  By a man who loves me.  To be held.  To be told I am beautiful, not in that purely aesthetic way, but inside of my soul, shining out.  To walk down a street with him and be satisfied...holding his hand.  TO write him songs, and sing to him.  To laugh with him.  To feel safe and secure and ACCEPTED...without question.  

These are things within me that I can't deny that I desire.

Do I desire them now?   Not necessarily.
Nor am I willing to just go out with the next guy that looks twice at me.
DO I want to look for him?  No.   
     I want to be found.  

These are feelings I feel when I can't get to sleep.
When someone hurt my feelings
When I read an inspirational romance.
When I feel alone.

They do not haunt me, and for that I am glad. 

I know in time, I will be at peace, whether single or not.  I know that love in someone should not be the deciding factor to my happiness.

That's reassuring, and now I am tired."

"event","I rode on Friday.  His name was Tonta.  A brown and white paint, I think.  I am not sure. Right before I rode, I tried to get to know the horse better.  You know what they say, the horse can sense your fear.  Even though I have been riding my whole life, it usually takes me about 5 minutes to get used to riding.  While Abby saddled him, I talked to him gently and nuzzled with him.  His eyes looked at me with this contented gaze.  I felt a connection, maybe imagined, maybe my own desire to connect with him, but I felt like...no matter what, even if he was a rough horse, this time he wouldn't be rough with me.  He liked my hand, and brushed his head up against my own.  I got on him to ride him around the corral and to get him used to me being in charge.  I couldn't believe how good he was with me, and I felt like it had to be blamed on our pre-riding bonding time.  We trotted gently around the corral and by the time we went around a couple of times, I was ready to ride.  For real!  Hard and fast and fun.  We went out, and the brisk air tingled against my skin and filled my lungs with an urgency for adventure.  The snow was new fallen and powdery.  Ready.  Completely ready.  We cantered up a small hill and trotted into the wood.  The snow clung to the naked scrany branches and a stream of white steamy air whistled out of Tonta's large nostrils.  He kept looking back at me, almost as if he wanted to know if I was ok, or ready for the adventure he held within him.  We finally reached a vast feild located on the Roger's property, and we let the horses go.  As they hit the large drifts, the snow flew and bristled against my cheeks, flying up around me like a silky veil.  Than there was a surge of power, like a rocket taking off, or a battery fully charged, and like a rocket, Tonta burst from beneath me and took off.  I resisted the desire to grab hold of the horn, which I had been doing once in a while on his small canters.  I let him take control, and Abby scolded me.  You can't let them do that, you know.  It lets them think they have the power.  They don't.  You do, and you can never let them have it.  But I kinda wanted him to have it.  On the way back he took a dump and needed to rest, but I guess I can understand that.  Everyone has got to go sometimes.  We came back through the wood to a wide open strip.  I looked longingly at Abby.  I wanted to run, and run so bad it surged through my veins and pumped wildly in my heart.  ""Just yell."" she told me.  ""Point him towards the hill and yell.""  I tried feebly at what I thought was a yell before she laughed and yelled, it's more like a ""Yah!""  ""Yah!""  I yelled, and felt the rocket take off once again, charging up the hill at a gallop.  He rode smoother than Nicky, but clumsily, once and a while stumbling in the drifts.  He was smaller, which worried me a bit, but he was faithful.  Best of all, he knew what I wanted, and he didn't run when I didn't want him to.  That was the best part.  When I took him back, we walked, trotted a little, but mostly went at a slow walk.  I talked to him softly, and storked his neck, feeling like I had made a friend in this horse, and that he understood me, and in a weird way I understood him.  It kinda made me love him.  If that is weird, it probably is, but I loved the ride, and I loved the horse.  It was a day."

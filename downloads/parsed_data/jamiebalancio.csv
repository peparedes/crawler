"event","I am finally done student teaching! Thursday was my official last day and the students were really sad. They kept joking around with me and fo some reason they were acting different. The class made a little book for me with different cards with their pictures on it. They were really cute.  Some part of me didn't want to leave the students since they finally got used to me be there and helping them out and stopped acting up because they knew my discipline policy. I also didnt want to leave my master teacher because I know she needs help next trimester with her combo class and many behavior students. But then again...I am TIRED of teaching and getting up really early and not having enough time to finish all of my work. Now I am able to do some work during the weekdays when I would be student teaching. (We'll see how that really goes.)

Well I think I have really learned so much by being in almost all grade levels (K/1, 3, 5/6) and also subbing for all grade levels. I have enjoyed all of the teachers at my schoolsite and I will actually miss the lunch conversations that go on in the lounge. Lunch was one of the most entertaining times of the day. 

Overall, this experience has been a very helpful despite the fact that I had master teachers that were not helpful, very helpful, and helpful when asked questions to. I am able to take what I want from each teacher and apply the things I like and certainly not use the things I could not stand about their style of teaching. 

It's finally over and we are one step closer to finishing our credential and almost done with our masters! YAY!"

"event","I don't know what it is about this week...I've been really productive. On a usual week, I don't really do much homework during the week and instead I save it all for the weekend. For some strange reason, I have been accomplishing everything on my ""to do"" list for the day. I think I might actually be able to take a day off this weekend from working on homework. The past 3 or 4 weekends have been devoted to completing all of the assignments so maybe this long weekend will be a little better. 

Do you ever get on a work high and just cant stop working, bu when you do something else you lose it and do not feel like doing anymore work for the day? I don't know, maybe I'm just stressed out and want to get things done already. Just a little thought.. Hope everyone has a great LONG weekend!!!"

"event","Today I had my last observation from my professor. I did not really have anything to teach so I just did a review lesson before the students took their math assessment today. I think that my lesson went really well. I had the students participating and engaged throughout the lesson. The lesson I taught was ordering percents, decimals, and fractions. I don't think that the topic was too difficult so I had good student participation. I am glad that all of my formal observations are over and that this student teaching is almost over as well.

This week was devoted all to math review. The students did math review all day and everyday until they took their test today. It was a little disappointing that we spent so much time reviewing and asking questions, but still a majority of students did not do so well. I wasn't able to see everyone's score, but of the ones I did see, they were basic or below basic. I do not know what else we could have done to prepare these students. 

Anyways, three more days of student teaching and we are DONE! Then it's time to start applying and looking for a job for next year. VERY STRESSFUL! I hope everyone had a great week!!"

"event","Trimester assessments have started this week and we have only done the writing assessment. On Monday we will be doing the language arts assessment and next Thursday we are taking the math assessment. My master teacher decided to save the math until the last day so the students can practice every day and night. When the students in my class test, they take the ENTIRE day. I was getting a little bored while the students were writing so I ended up writing up two lesson plans and two powerpoints. Even after that, they still had another half day...Even though they were given all day, the students started to give up or just get tired of writing half way through the day. 

For PE this week, I had previously promised the 6th graders that I would run laps with them so they were so excited. Everyday since last week, a different student would remind me to bring my running shoes on PE day. So when I finally ran (and beat many students) they were surprised that 1. a teacher is actually running laps with the students and 2. an ""old"" lady is beating them. It was a lot of fun. I did not have to send anyone back to class this week. I think the students are all getting used to me teaching them. 

I am a little sad that I'm almost done teaching these students, but at the same time I cannot wait! There are some students that I cannot stand, but there are 5 times as many students that I enjoy teaching. As I think about it, the teaching profession kind of stinks because you get to know these students for a year and really bond with them and after nine months you have to give them away. I guess it can be a good thing when you dont like your students. Well I only have 2 more weeks left of teaching and I feel like I have a lot of teaching left but I really dont. I think I am done teaching all of my lessons. All I have to do is write them up (the worst part). I have a few more things to take care of then it's all over! Well I need to stay in the present and get through these next two weeks. 

I hope you all are having a good time teaching and enjoying your students!"

"event","Things have been going well in my classroom. I feel like I don't do as much as I am supposed to, but I am still learning through observing my teacher teach certain things. Last Tuesday, my students were really bad. I just had one of those days where I was really thinking if this is what I really want to do for a good portion of my life. My teacher was really supportive and talked me through the whole thing which was so nice of her. She knew I could handle the students and I did. I just had to change the student's view of me and that was it. The rest of the week went okay. I subbed for my teacher on Thursday and the kids were still not very good, but my teacher told me that she talked with the students about their inappropriate behavior. I really hope things change this week and the next couple weeks. I only have 3 more weeks in the classroom so I am both excited and nervous since I have stuff to still do. 

This coming week, the students will be starting their trimester assessments but I do not think we are ready to test until next week. Things are going really fast and we'll see how much the students can retain for these different tests. Well that is it for now. I have plenty of work to catch up on."

"event","On Thursday, my class had their monthly store. Throughout the year, the students are given a checkbook that they are responsible for. The are given fake money throughout the months for good behavior and turning in progress reports, but are required to pay the teacher every time they use the restroom or for inappropriate behavior. On store days, the students are formed into different businesses where they are able to sell certain things. At the beginning of the year, the students were asked to fill out business proposals that listen the people who were part of their business as well as what they are going to sell. So on the store day, the students brought in food, candy, drinks, etc that they were going to sell. Each sixth grade classroom has store on the same day so the students are able to go shopping at the ""mall"" and buy things from the other classroom. As a teacher, you get unlimited money and can get whatever you want for free. It was great! 

My master teacher said that if I wanted to, I can set up the next store since I will get to participate in another one before my student teaching is over. This is something that I would like to implement in my own classroom since it is a good incentive program for the students to want to work toward to be able to participate in. 

Things are going well in my classroom and time is going by really fast. My fourth week is already over and I have hit the halfway point of my last quarter of student teaching. Four more weeks to get all my lessons taught and everything done."

"event","On Tuesday, I took my sixth graders on a field trip to the Riverside Court House. My master teacher stayed at school with the fifth graders since it was a sixth grade field trip. I was a little bit nervous only because I have never taken kids on a field trip on my own before. I was also nervous because I was afraid that my behavior students would act up and embarrass the school and  have us kicked out of the court house. Surprisingly the day came and the next thing I knew, I was on the bus with my sixth graders. I had 1 mom helper come and 1 met us at the courthouse. The students listened and followed whatever directions I gave them. I could not believe how well behaved the students were. When we go there, the lady who was supposed to meet us was not there so we waited for a little while until the aide went and looked for the lady. When she finally came out, they took the students into the building for the mock trial. The students did a great job getting into character and behaving properly and respectfully. Then we were told that we had a case to go to so I lined the students up and marched to the actual court house. We got to see a criminal case which was easy for the students to understand. The judge was so nice to us. He allowed the students to ask questions while they waited for the next witness to arrive. The attorneys and the bailiff were also very nice to us. The prosecuting attorney was very cute...Anyways, the students asked intelligent questions to the judge. I was very proud of them. Then, the witness was ready do the actual court was in session. We watched the attorneys question the witness. It looked just like T.V! Once the witness was done, the judge called a lunch break so then the judge allowed the students to ask more questions about what they just saw. Again, my students had such smart questions. After, the bailiff let the students look into the holding cell where the defendants are kept. All of the people at the court were so nice to us. After, we lined up again and waited for the bus. Overall, my field trip experience was a very positive one. My students really proved me wrong. They showed me that they can be on their best behavior when they really need to. I enjoyed my time and the experience...I was just really tired at the end of the day!"

"event","I have been trying to keep up with all of my work that I have this quarter but each week, things keep on piling on. It seems like every time I cross something off my list 2 more things are added. It feels never-ending!

Anyway, Im almost finished teaching my math unit and I already videotaped my lesson that I will use for Pact this quarter. Pact is so overwhelming with so much to do and so many little requirements. I'm going to try to stay on top of all of this so that things don't start to pile up but we'll see if I have enough time. It's so hard for me to do homework on nights that I teach because I am so exauseted from everything that all I have energy to do is lesson plan for my next day. It doesnt help that my school starts at 7:45am and I have to be there by 7:25am. 

I planned out what I want to do for my fine arts unit and I have set up times with my master teacher when I am going to start teaching the unit. All I have to do is research and put my powerpoint presentation together. I have a  lot to do within this week alone so if I start looking like a zombie, I apologize in advance. I am kind of excited to have my own classroom and be able to do things the way I want to and not have to worry about all of this work I am doing at the same time. 

Well this week should be fun since I'll be going on a field trip on Tuesday and out class is having store on Thursday. I am excited to see how they do store and be able to compare it to how I did it when I was in elementary school. I am actually looking forward to this week despite all the school work I have. 

Good luck everyone and have a good week!!"

"event","So I finished my third week in my 5th/6th combo. Things are getting better and a lot easier. The students are still talkative and still trying to see how far they can push me, but they are quickly learning that I have as much power as my master teacher. My teacher also lets me discipline the students and take full control while I am teaching. 

I really enjoy working with my master teacher this quarter. She is so helpful and willing to do whatever I need so I can get the most out of my experience. She is allowing me to grade the students' writing so I can have some practice grading witing before I go into my own classroom not knowing how to grade it. She is also letting me go with the 6th graders on their field trip this coming week to the Riverside Court. I hope everything goes well and that the students behave properly while we are there. My master teacher is letting me take a break from teaching the sixth graders to try teaching the 5th graders. I think it is only fair since the sixth graders have been getting all of my attention and they want me to teach them too. So starting this week, I will start teaching 5th grade language arts and some math. However, their next chatpter is geometry but I hate geometry and my master teacher LOVES teaching geometry so she said that I can jut observe and take notes on the way that she teaches it so that the students are able to understand and have fun with it. 

Overall, I am enjoying 5th and 6th grade especially working with my teacher!"

"event","This week started out somewhat bad when I woke up in the morning feeling really sick. My throat was sore, I had a headache etc. I still got ready and came to school. My teacher and I had previously planned that I was going to be teaching the sixth graders what I wanted so I had my day prepared and planned. I taught them their language arts and math lessons still facing the same problems as last week with the set up of the classroom. I worked through it and go through my lessons. By the end of the day, I felt even worse yet I still stayed and planned with my teacher. My master teacher planned on being at a GATE conference for the next two days so I agreed to sub for her since I already know the students and I can teach them new things. But, during lunch, my master teacher's sub got hurt on the playground pretty much fracturing his foot, so she ended up having to take care of him. She gave me things to teach for the next two days and we scheduled the days together. I felt rather confident that it wouldn't be so bad, but little did I know. 

I ended up subbing for my master teacher Tuesday through Thursday and those were one of the toughest days that I had teaching. It is so difficult trying to teach two grade levels. When I gave one grade work to do so I could teach the other grade, they would finish early or talk which would then distract the grade that I am teaching causing me to stop teaching and talking to the other grade. Once I finally got though the lessons, I would have to rewind and do the same thing with the other grade. It was more tiring than difficult. It was hard constantly disciplining the students. I have only had one day of observation and I think I need to do a little bit more observation but there is not much time since I only have 6 more weeks left to teach and do all of my requirements. I am starting to feel a little overwhelmed but I need to take things one at a time just as I have done in the past 2 quarters. 

So this second week has been pretty draining for me and somewhat discouraging to want to continue working with these students. So much happens in one day that it is hard to write and record everything. I think I will continue to look positively in each of the students and I hope my master teacher is able to come back on Tuesday so things get back to normal."

"event","So I have finished my first week of student teaching. I am in another combination class which is really difficult. I am in a 5th and 6th grade combo with a really good teacher. This is my last quarter of student teaching and it is probably going to be one of the most challenging quarters so far. There is a big difference between fifth and sixth grade at the school I teach at. All of a sudden, there is more technology that is being used such as the ""Smart Board"" and the ""Document camera."" 

So let me give a quick recap of the week. I started my first day on Tuesday January 2 and I mostly observed and learned the students' names. I found that I am really good with learning people's names. After school, my teacher and I planned and she asked me if i felt comfortable teaching already. After seeing her work so hard trying to teach both grades, I said that I would help her out tomorrow and start teaching a language arts lesson. So we planned and boy does my master teacher talk a lot. But it isnt like she talks about random things that are useless, all of the things she says are very useful and for my benefit so I cannot really complain. She likes to go in depth when talking about everything.

The next day I taught my lesson and did a little bit more observing then after school planned to teach more language arts and math with the sixth graders which is pretty much teaching the whole day. So I was a little overwhelmed but I could handle it. The hardest part in teaching the sixth graders is the position of their seats. They are all facing the front of the room where the Smart Board is, but I teach using the white board so they have to constantly turn around and try to pay attention. It was definately really hard teaching a lesson while my master teacher was also teaching the fifth graders at the same time. 

Thursday was the same and then Friday, my master teacher was not able to come to school so I was asked to sub her class. It was the first time that I subbed her class and a combo class. It was a pretty tiring day since I was teaching things twice since I would work with the fifth graders then do the exact thing with the sisth graders. The students had okay behavior but it was still challenging teaching 2 grades at the same time.

So so much has happened in just the first week. I look forward to getting a hang of how things go in this classroom. I am trying to figure out my master teacher's management plan for her class and things are slowly piecing together. We only have 8 weeks and one is already over. I have a feeling this quarter will go by fast!"

"event","Today was my last day of student teaching in my 3rd grade class. Along with the students I was kind of sad to not be working with this great group of students. It made me also feel good to know that I made some kind of connection with all of the students since they seemed to get attached and not want me to go. 

I got my placement for next quarter and I am not sure if I am looking forward to it teaching a 5/6 combo class. Im kinda of nervous even though I have worked with 5th and 6th graders before. 

So today, since it was my last day, I brought my students their earned candy and had a pizza party with the students who got enough stickers from my incentive program. The students had a blast at our pizza party and those were the students I also got really close to. Even though we arent allowed to have favorite students but pretty much 3/4 of the class was my favorite. There were probably 3-5 students that I could have done without, but nonetheless they were all my favorite. The class got me a going away gift and made special cards for me. I really appreciated all of it. 

Today I also did my last science lesson where I taught them the scientific method. We did a little experiement using Skittles and the scientific method. The students seemed to enjoy the activity and the Skittles. During this lesson I also had my second observation. It went pretty well so I am happy with the whole lesson.

That was pretty much my last day of third grade. I will be stopping by their Halloween party tomorrow so I can bring my teacher her gift and say goodbye to my students."

My teacher asked me to pick up the students from the playground after recess. I got the students and took them back to the classroom. I taught the students spelling and the capital cursive letter ""I"". Then the students did a reading and writing activity until lunch. After lunch, I started reading this story to the students until it was time for science. I had my formal observation today which I think went okay. I taught a lesson on decomposers and we were able to do a mini experiment where I gave the students a slice of bread and some apples and put it in a bag so we can watch the changes in the food over a week. The students did a really good job as I taught the lesson. I gave back their science tests so they can see how they did. 

Then it was time to start packing up so I had the students start getting ready to pack up. While I was calling groups to pack up, the office made a wierd announcement on the P.A system saying ""Tigers in the Den"" At this time, my teacher was not in the room and I had no idea what that meant. The students were also clueless as well so I had the students finish packing up and sitting quietly at their desks. Then my teacher came in with a serious face and did not say anything. She took her keys and locked the door. Now the students were still asking what the announcement meant. The teacher told the students that something bad is going on in the neighborhood and the safest place for the students were in the classroom. All of a sudden, the students started to notice the sounds of the helicopters flying over the school. A few kids got scared and started crying. The bell rang, but we couldn't let the students out. My teacher asked me to finish reading the book I started with the students and then we played heads up 7 up. Finally after a 1/2 hour, the office made an announcement saying we can escort the students out. During this time we also found out that one of our custodians got hit in his car by a police officer and it was a hit and run since the officer was trying to find the suspects. It was a pretty long and interesting day!"

I met my teacher during recess and went to get the students from the playground. Right after recess I taught the rest of the day. I started with spelling and gave the students a corssword puzzle activity to do with the students. Then I taught cursive. We worked on the capital letter S. The students seemed to catch on quickly. Then the students did some reading circles while I corrected their math assessment test. Surprisingly, the students did a really good job with the exception of the same students who don't do well. Next we had lunch and then science at the end of the day. The students were give one last day to work on their project. The students who were already finished went out to P.E with my teacher. It was amazing how motivated the students were to finish their project when they knew that P.E was the reward. 

After school, I put my bulletin board together. I put up the projects that the students did for me. My teacher said it looks nice but I think it just looks odd because we had to use a cabinet instead of a wall. Overall, I am pleased with the student's work."

"event","Today was a pretty easy day for me. Since the first trimester is coming to a close, a lot of testing is going on. Today my students did their writing test where they had to write a friendly letter to a friend telling them about an book they like. While the students were writing, I was correcting and checking off work that the students have done. The teacher gave them until recess to finish. Everyone finished a little early so we took the students out to recess early. We had recess duty this week so it was kind of fun to watch the kids play. It kind of reminded me of when I was in elementary school playing tetherball or just running around with the boys. 

After recess I taught spelling, cursive, and my math lesson. I didnt really like my math lesson since it was another problem solving lesson which the students dislike. So I decided to do the classwork as a class to save some time and because the students have been doing so well on the independent practice throughout the whole unit. After math was lunch and then since it was the first Wednesday of the month, it was reward day. Students who turned in all of their homework and did not have any behavior problems were able to watch a movie after lunch and the other went to detention in the other classroom. 

That was pretty much my whole day. I did a lot of little things around the classroom and with the students but it was an overall good day even though I was really tired."

"event","So today was another average day. I taught almost the whole day with exception to some activities. I dont know why but I am excited that this student teaching experience for the quarter is almost over. I find myself counting down the days. I really like the students. I think if it werent for them and their enthusiasm each day I couldnt be so excited to teach them. I have to admit that there are some students I can do without but in general they all respect me as their teacher and they really try their best when I am teaching. 

Last week, my teacher let me rearrange the student's seats. She wanted me to move the students and group them how I wanted based on what I have seen the previous month. It was interesting to see and think about how each student interacts with another and who would work best together. 

In my lessons, I have been doing a lot of group competitions which allows the students to work cooperatively with each other. So for science, the students are working on this brochure that I am having them make about a certain habitat/environment. The students are so into the whole thing which makes me excited and happy. 

Today during science, this one kid was arguing with me about the assignment and would not stop even when the teacher intervened so we sent him up to the office. I would not really expect this behavior from this student but he needs to learn that I will not be talked to in a disrespectful way. At the end of the day my teacher helped me find an IEP for the student we need to write about. That is pretty much how my day was.

I think I really like third grade and the mind set of the students. They know how to do most things on their own after given directions. 

So today my teacher told me that I was going to take over the spelling and cursive along with continuing my math and science unit. So basically I teach the whole day except for reading. Im really glad that my teacher is letting me take over more and more. I realized that teaching most of the day makes the time go faster. So today I introduced the spelling words and did some cursive with the students. I cant believe how much they love to write in cursive. Even the student who doesnt do any work does his cursive worksheet. My math unit is almost done and I will be giving them their chapter test this Friday when I am subbing for my teacher. 

Overall I am enjoying this quarter of student teaching but not enjoying all the stuff we have to do. We gotta do what we gotta do."

So I almost didnt want to go to school today but I knew I was going to do my video taping and I had to teach my lessons, so I just sucked it up and went. My math lesson went okay but by science (1:00) I felt like I was going to die. I could barely move since my body is so sore and it seemed like the students couldnt hear me, plus I couldnt even hear myself. It was really hard. I kind of look up to teachers now that come to school when they are sick because it is hard work. 

So Megan video taped my math lesson (Thank you!) But I am afraid to watch it. I dont like seeing myself but I have to see it sooner or later. Tomorrow is a minimum day for the students so that means I get to go home early which is good for me so I can rest. My teacher told me that she wanted me to start teaching spelling next week. How exactly do you teach spelling? I guess I just need to make up some activities and worksheets for them to practice. 

Im glad my teacher is letting me take over more and more lessons every week. Im glad that I am given the opportunity to actually practice teaching instead of just watching because it is a whole different ballgame. That's about it for today. I need to try to get some work done."

"event","So today was a pretty good day with all of my lessons. It seemed like my teacher let me teach half of the day considering my math lesson is the hour before lunch and science is the hour after lunch. But anyway, it was still good to have control of the class at least for half of the day. I think the students really enjoyed making the clocks for math and I think it's a really good manipulative for my students as well as for me. I am really enjoying my 3rd grade class. Sometimes they can be so frustrating and other times they are just them. 

There's just never-ending work to do. There is always a paper or planning that has to be done every night. Tomorrow I am planning on taping my math lesson so I hope it goes well. I will be teaching time to the minute with the students. I always hate watching myself or even hearing my own voice. I hope the students behave too so my 10 minutes wouldn't be just disciplining the students. On Wed. it is a minimum day so I'm really happy since I have a lot to get done before Friday. I am also going to be subbing for the kindergarten special day class on Thursday so I wont really have a break until this weekend. I really need to take a break from all of this work and school.  

Well that is all for today. I need to plan my lessons for tomorrow."

I enjoy most of the time that I spend with the students, especially since I am working with a really good class. Oh well, hopefully things get better.

So today I started my own incentive program with the students and they are really excited about it. I made each student a sticker card and they can earn stickers from me when they are good during my lessons, do their classwork etc,. Anyways they are really good about wanting to earn the stickers just to have lunch with me on my last day. 

My science is going pretty well. I fixed my animal sounds CD and they really enjoyed listening to it. I wish we had more time to listen to more, but time just flies everytime I teach a lesson. 

I am really enjoying my experience this quarter since my teacher is very organized and lets me do things with the class. It's a lot more prep work than kindergarten but it's a lot easier teaching kids who can read and write already. 

Okay that's about it. I have a lot to do for my lessons next week. Thank goodness for weekends!"

"event","Today I taught my math lesson which I think went fairly well. The students understood the material for the most part. I didnt have as many questions during the independent practice. On the other hand, I didnt like my science lesson. First off, the students were kind of talkative since they have never done science before. Then when I tried to play the Animal Sounds CD that I made, it didn't work. I feel like I didnt make it as fun as they expected science to be. I also feel like I gave them too much information in just a short amount of time. I am really discouraged to keep teaching science. I dont really have an example to go off since I have never observed ANY teacher teach science or social studies. I really want to find a cool science experiment or project we can do as a class but there isn't really anything I can think of that deals with my unit. Oh well, I'll figure something out. I hope tomorrow gets better."

So today I taught my 3rd lesson in math on counting back change. The students had a really hard time with this lesson and I found it hard to come up with another way to explain it to the students. I was kind of frustrated because I knew they did not understand but I couldnt do or say anything to them at that particular time to make it easier. I am going to try to reteach it on Monday before I start a new lesson. I think I have a better way to teach it, so I will try it again. Today Dr. W came to watch part of my lesson and the students were very good. I am so appreciative to have such good students (when they want to be). Anyways, I am enjoying this round of student teaching but there is a lot more work to do especially since my teacher actually gives me work to do. I start my Science unit on Monday which I am also very nervous about since I am not too great at science. Also because the students are so excited about science that I want to make it fun but I dont know how. Hopefully, I wont turn them away from science. Well that's about it!"

I also thought the students would know more about money since it is something they see everyday. The lesson went pretty well and my teacher told me I didnt seem nervous at all. She gave me some ideas that I can do with the students which was very helpful. Im really glad to have this teacher. The students are getting used to me being there and look up to me as a teacher. I am enjoying third grade. In the morning I had to work with a new student on his cursive because he has never written in cursive yet. He did really well and said that he really enjoys writing in cursive. I planned my next math lesson and got things prepared for my upcoming lessons."

So my teacher didn't hesitate and gave me a math unit to start teaching on Monday. She also gave me a science chapter to start preparing for since I will start science when she is done with Social Studies. It was another easy day. I planned out my math unit and looked through the book and workbooks. It is actually really interesting to see how it is teaching to a whole class of 34 instead of just 4 students that I taught last quarter. I am excited to start teaching lessons but also very anxious at the same time. I did a lot of observation today too and I think I have a good understanding of how the class is run. The students are a lot of fun but can also be trouble makers. It was this girls birthday so she brought in cupcakes for the class. We went out to recess early so the students can eat their cupcakes and drink their juice. While the students were eating this one boy asked a group of students if they dare him to smash the cupcake in his face. Of course the kids said yes, so the kid put the cupcake in his own face. The teacher saw him and he got detention for a whole week. It was just funny to see a kid do that and not think he wouldnt get in trouble. Well it was another easy day.

I did a lot of observation the first day and started memorizing the student's names. My teacher is very organized and she does things in a very particular way. She has what the students are going to do on the board. The class was really good that day. For their writing assignment for the day, they were asked to write me a letter telling me about themselves. The teacher then told the students that I was going to write back to each of them. So before the day ended, I started reading some of the letters and wrote back to the students. I ended up taking some of it home at the end of the day to finish. It was a pretty easy day of observation."

I worked with them on a graphing worksheet where they needed to count fishes and graph them. The students I worked with did really well and got it really fast. At recess I watched the students play on the playground and then it was time to go back into the classroom. Today the yard supervisor was not there so we did not rotate and do ELD. Instead the students learned about different kinds of fishes. I read the students a story about fishes but they were too noisy so we stopped the story. Whe it was time for lunch, there is usually someone who takes the kindergarteners to lunch since my teacher goes to lunch with the first graders but today since the lady was not there noone took the class so my teacher left me with the 1st graders and took the k's to lunch. We corrected some of the morning work and did some independent reading. When the K's came back from lunch there was noone to dismiss them so my teacher had to stay and dismiss them while I took the first graders to lunch and had my lunch. My teacher came to lunch later so I had to pick up the 1st graders and start them on some work. I had the students write a complete story about what they did over the weekend using transition words such as ""first, next, then, finally"". They completed their story so we finished writing spelling sentences. The teacher came back but let me teach the rest of the day. She gave me a math lesson to teach the students and they did really well. On the second lesson that had to do with problem solving, the students had a hard time so I had to keep going over the same things with them. Eventually, they got it and we practices adding and subtracting. Then we had to pack up and leave.The day was pretty eventful since I taught the rest of the day after lunch.

I taught them about the ""oy"" and ""oi"" sounds. We came up with words and found them in the story we had to read. We also did some rhyming and spelling activities. The students did a good job and I think they enjoyed getting the special teaching attention that they arent able to get when the kindergarten students are there. I took the students to recess and after recess the first graders were telling the teacher how they learned so much and really liked me as their teacher. It was kind of embarassing because it kind of looked like I told them to say those things, but I really did not. It makes me happy to know that they are learning and having a good time too. We did some calendar activities and sang songs again. After, I took the students back to the other classroom and we reviewed and corrected the morning work they did. After lunch I gave the students a math assessment test that I made for the Time unit. They all did really well. Then the teacher and I split the students up and did some addition and subtraction flashcards with the students. That was pretty much the whole day!

Lately I have been having second thoughts about if teaching is really what I want to do. I have heard a lot of positive and negative things from the teachers that make me second guess myself and reconsider if this is what I want. I know I want to go through this program and really evaluate everything at the end. But today one of my students raised her hand and told me that I would be a great teacher and she would want to be in my class. Comments like those make me want to become a teacher regardless of all the negative things I have heard. I think my heart is really for the kids and not the drama that teachers have to go through."

Everyday I come to school makes me like teaching Kindergarten more and more. I think I can possibly see myself teaching a kinder class. Things are going well with the students and the teachers. I still have not been able to teach the whole day, and I do not think my teacher has that in her plans. Oh well, I am still able to learn so much from just observing and helping out in whatever I can. I am, however, given the opportunity to teach the first graders different lessons in Language Arts and Math. I really enjoy working with those 4 students. After school, I helped my teacher bind some journals for her class. At first we didnt know how to do it so another teacher helped us but then had to leave to take a phone call so we were left to figure it all out. I ended up figuring it out and made almost all the journals. I really like helping out anyway I can. Thats pretty much all that happened."

There was this one student who is from the special day class who copied every single sentence and spelling from this one girl. I told him to make sure he does his own work. At recess I watched the students play on the playground and I was able to talk to some students about things not relating to school such as things they like to do and play with since I don't really know what's ""cool"" anymore. After recess the teacher did some calendar activites and then the students sang songs. They sang the ""Oh Boy Alphabet Song"" which reminded me of my 6th birthday party when I had a clown who made us sing that song. It was just really funny!

From the students that I tested today, my teacher told me that 2 of the students are going to be retained for next year. I think my teacher is making a good decision because they have shown little progress and I do not think they would do well in first grade. I took some pictures of the students while they were doing rotations. I taught my lesson to the first graders about the calendar which went pretty well.

The teacher had good classroom management so everything went smooth. But in addition to that, she had an aid and a student teacher. After my obervation I went back to the classroom and took some pictures of the kindergarteners since I only had pictures of the  first graders. So the teacher read some stories about farm animals and I took pictures and did more observation. Im kind of tired of observing but I just have to do what the teacher lets me. So after that, it was overlap time so I took the students to B1 and I taught them ""day 2"" in the language arts book. They did a good job and listened very well. I took the students back to the classroom we read a story together. We had lunch and then the teacher did a review of what I taught them earlier and then she left me to do my math lesson. We did some problem solving which the students hate since they have to think. I also had the students do a mixed practice that reviewed adding, subtracting, and time. I offered the students a treat for the first person to finish and get all the questions correct. This really motivated the students to want to do the work. I am really enjoying how things are going now with my teacher and the lessons that I am able to do. We had a few extra minutes at the end before the students had to go home so I played Brain Quest with the students. They had a good time playing. I didn't realize how easy the questions were. I remember when I was in elementary school, those questions were really hard. I guess times have changed..Afterschool, I helped my teacher tie ribbon on the Mother's Day gifts.

For some people, they would be like ""oh man..another lesson!"" but for me, I was so happy since I hardly get to teach many lessons in the class. I think my teacher is just starting to get used to me being there and realizing that I WANT to do work. People may think that I'm crazy, but when you are sitting in a classroom with only 5 hours of sleep, you are certain to just fall asleep in the little chairs. Also, by teaching lessons or doing some kind of project for the teacher makes the day go by faster. I noticed that the school day is not really that long when you are teaching or doing something. So anyways, I was working with the first graders and it was all boys since the only girl was absent, and we actually had a good time. The students responded well to the lesson and seemed to understand it. I can't wait until my teacher lets me do more with the kindergarteners. Anyways, the day went by as usual, I got to teach my math lessons at the end of the day and took some pictures for my photo gallery. After school, I went with Tongchin and her teacher to look through the cum files. It went pretty fast since her teacher was helping us. That was pretty much the day. Nothing too exciting."

I kinda of got the feeling that my teacher didnt want me there. Hmm..oh well only 4 more weeks left! Anyways so I did the normal stuff again and then taught my lesson in the afternoon. I taught two lessons today. One on writing time another way and reading digital clocks. We made little digital clocks which the students liked. They understood the lessons too. There was one student who was not really trying his best so I helped him out and he understood it. A sub from another class took over the last hour since my teacher and I asked to help the PM kindergarted teacher since she is doing testing with the her class. I really like helping out with her class because I am able to actually work with the students and help them out unlike in the morning. I would think that if a teacher has a student teacher, they would utilize them and make them help them out with things with the students or around the classroom.

The bad part of today was that I had the last hour of the day to teach my lesson and the students were already restless and wanting to go home so they werent really into the whole lesson.

Since I taught the lesson yesterday on the letter ""U"" I also conducted a mini review of what we learned. I asked if they remembered words that started with the letter ""u"" and words that had the ""u"" sound in the middle of a word such as ""cut"", ""dug"", ""hug"" etc. It was really fun getting work with them. After that the teacher took over the Kinder class and gave me a lesson to teach the first graders. I taught them a lesson the out ""ou"" and ""ow"" sound. We worked on a packet that was put together by the teacher and I assisted the students with any questions they had. I worked closely with this one student since he needs extra help in reading. We had recess and then I was told to lead the math activity which was practicing subtraction again with the students. The students seemed to enjoy the activity since they are given somewhat of the ""spotlight."" Once the students started getting tired of the activity, I had the students do some kind of a listening game. I intended it to be a way for them to sit down and be quiet. But it  ended up being really productive. The students did a good job with that activity as well. During ELD time I worked with the first graders in the other classroom. We corrected all of the morning work and then went back to the classroom to do some independent reading. Next came lunch time and it went as usual. After lunch, one of the students were missing so the teacher went to go look for him and asked me to take them into the classroom. I read the students a story about a butterfly since that is what they are learning about right now. After the story, I taught two math lessons to the students on comparing time such as a minute versus an hour. I also taught them how to read time to the hour. The lessons were very easy so they got the material fairly quickly. After that, the teacher gave them a math timed test on adding and subtracting. I was surprised to see the students still had to count on a number line to get the answer. After was was done, they did some reading in their literature book. They reread the story ""The Forest"" and then read a book about the butterfly and its cycle. After the story, they were asked to write a description of either a butterfly or a caterpillar. The students seemed to have a hard time writing the descriptions because they ended up writing about the butterfly's cycle. Once they were done with that, it was already time to go back to the other classroom and start packing up. After school, I worked more on the bulletin boards, but I did not get to finish since the other teacher did not have all of her students' papers done. I had to leave early since we had class right after. It was a pretty fun day since I was able to do a lot with the students!"

I thought I was going to sub for her class or take over for her but I didnt have my paperwork done so she had to call a sub. I started doing the morning activities. I taught the lesson on the letter for the day which was the letter U. We sang the song for the letter U and traced the letter in the air. I also asked the students to come up with words that have the ""u"" sound. We wrote down CVC words with the ""u""  sound as well. I actually did a lot of teaching today. I read the students the story called ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar."" The students liked the story so much that we read it again. On the second time around, I had the students help me read the story. They did a really good job. At this point, the substitute came and introduced herself the the classroom. She seemed very nice. She let me continue with the class until it was time for rotations. I basically took charge of the class. I lined up the groups and delegated where each group went. I was in charge of the subtraction rotation. The red group which is the low group had a hard time understanding how to do it so they didnt finish the whole worksheet. The blue group, however, finished the worksheet really fast. After the rotations they went to recess. I watched the students as they played and talked with the substitute. After recess we made some math sentences with the students. Then I had to go with the first graders to B1 but the door was locked so I took the first graders to room 8 where the kindergarteners were doing calendar activities. The class was out of control and the substitute did not know what she was doing. At one point she was fighting with the yard supervisor who was supposed to be leading the group anyway. So after all that was done, I took the first graders back to the classroom and they finished up with their spelling. The lesson plans that the teacher left were not detailed at all. So the sub and I had no idea what we were supposed to do. I did the best that I could with what we usually do. Next we went to lunch. I walked the students to the lunch line and then met the sub in the teacher lounge because she wanted me to go out to lunch with her. I went with her andd had lunch with her at the park next to the school because she didnt want to eat lunch in the lounge. So when I came back I spoke with Dr. Walsack and told her I was going to teach a lesson. I went with the student teacher to get the key for B1 and I had to go find the math books for the students. I found the books in room 1 and then brought it back to B1. I I taught my lesson on ordering time and Dr. Walsack observed my lesson. I read with the students and then had to leave because we had a meeting with the principal. By the time our meeting was over, the school day was over and the students all went home. I went with Tongchin to find her teacher because she was going to be in the cum. room with us. But we ended up having some difficulties with it so we are going to do it on Wed. That was pretty much the day for me. It was so hectic and disorganized that I didnt know what to do! Oh well its all over!"

So I took the attendance and did the lunch count as my teacher was getting ready for her observation by the assistant principal. After I did the morning routine, the assistant principal came and observed my teacher as she taught a math lesson on subtracting numbers. At this time, I was working with the first graders on their morning work that they have to do. We worked on some spelling activities and reading comprehension. When it was time for rotations, I worked with a group of kindergardeners who were absent on the day we did the ""What I Want to Be"" project that I made as a bulletin board. So I  helped them make their paper dolls and write their sentence. It was hard not to just spell the words out for them. I had to have the students sound it out and just write what they heard. Once I finished with the other students there was one student left. He is really behind and doesnt really know his sounds and alphabet. He couldnt even sing the ABC song correctly. So it was a challenge to get him to write just one sentence. I eventually had to help him spell and show him what each letter looked like so he would be able to write a decent sentence. Next we had recess. I watched the students play and talked with a couple of teachers for a little bit. It is really exciting to hear what other teachers have to say about certain things. It's actually really funny. So after recess I worked a little bit more on the bulletin board finishing up the stuff the students worked on today. Then I went and sang song with the kinder students. They went to lunch so then I stayed back with the first graders. We read stories until it was time to go to lunch. This time I went to lunch and heard some funny stories from the teachers. They really have good gossip! haha..anyways after lunch we did independent reading and I also read to them a little until we had to move classrooms to room 5 since some class had to use the class we usually use. So the first graders did some reading in their literature book and they had to write a summary of what they learned. I worked with some students from the other class as well. Then it was time to go so we went back to our classroom and got ready to go home. Afterschool, I worked on some stuff for the other teacher for my bulletin board as well. Then we had to leave so we can get to class in time. That was my day!"

"event","So today was a normal day..Same routine and everything. I worked really closly with the first graders and taught them a lesson on the ending sounds such as -s,-ed-ing.It was pretty easy for them to understand. We I also did playground duty for my teacher since a lot of the students couldnt go out to recess since they didnt finish their work. After recess, I started on my bulletin board. It's coming along okay I just need the other teachers work so I can finish it. So the sad part of my day was when I was working on the board, I didnt realize it was lunch time and my teacher didnt even say anything to me. So the next thing I notice is a quiet classroom and noone was in there. The teacher didnt even tell me she was leaving for lunch or anything! So I kept on working through lunch. It's kind of sad when your master teacher doesnt even tell you to come to lunch. Oh well..So the rest of the day I was working on the bulletin board. Towards the end I helped with the PM kindergarten rotation and worked with the students on the ""th"" sound and also gave a math assessment test. After school Tongchin came and helped me get the little art project for one of the teachers in the storage room. Then we went home. I didn't realize it but after banging that stapler on that wall, it can give you some little bruises!"

"event","When I got to school I went to my classroom and helped out with preparing things. The students came in and they reviewed their letter and sound of the week. The letter is ""Y"" and the sound for the first graders is the ""oo"" sound. We talked about what the students what to be when they grow up. It was interesting what the students said they wanted to be. It was sad though because this little boy kepted saying different superheros that he wanted to be, but the teacher had to keep telling him that they were make believe. The little boy looked really sad after the teacher told him that. Then for rotations, I was put in chage of the paper dolls. The students were asked to make paperdolls of the person they wanted to be. It was somewhat easy because they already had the clothes and the bodies made and the students just had to glue on their clothes. Earlier I told my teacher that I had to put together a bulletin board so she said that I can be in charge of this bulletin board. So once the students were done and were at recess I started working on cutting out the sentences the students made and putting a background on it. I did it for the rest of the morning and finished right before lunch. I went to lunch and then worked with the first graders on some reading after lunch and then went to help in the PM kindergarten class. I was in charge of the paperdolls again but this time it was harder since the students had to make their own clothes. It got a little messy but they students all wanted to be the same thing. Most of them wanted to be baseball players. It was really interesting working with these students. After that I cleaned up and the students went home. I stayed after and worked on more of the stuff for my bulletin board. And then left to go home and rush to class. That was it!"

"event","So today I carpooled with the other students teachers at my school, Tongchin and Megan. It was a normal day, I got there and helped prepare a little bit and then the students came in and the day started. I worked with the 1st graders again during the rotations. We worked on some worksheets and did some spelling sentences. I worked closely with Noah again just to make sure he is trying. After that was recess. I played with some kids and walked around and just watched the students. After, a story was read and then we left for ELD and calendar. Dr. Walsack came during that time and at that time I am not really doing anything with the students. I talked with her briefly. There really wasnt much for her to see. Then I read a story with the first graders about giving a pig pancakes. It was like the story If You Give A Mouse A Cookie. We first listened to it on tape then we read it together taking turns. We had a fe minutes before lunch so we did a story building game. We had lunch and after we were in room 13 doing math and more language arts with the students. After that, it was time to go home. Once the students left, I stayed and talked with the teachers. Mrs. Betro showed me the assessement for math that is given to the students at the end of the year. I asked some questions and then I went home."

"event","It was another day of student teaching. Nothing too interesting. While I was working with my first graders, Dr. Walsack came in and observed with the principal. I'm glad I was doing something at that time. I was working with Noah with his reading. He is struggling a lot reading simple sight words. He needs to practice more and take his time while he is reading. There wasn't anything really exciting that happened that day. It was pretty repetitive. I hope next week gets better and I have more to do."

"event","Today was the day that the Distinguished School people from the district came to the school and toured and looked at everything. It was weird to see how the teachers were forced to act and how clean everything looked. The people came and they said that it went pretty well. As I was teaching a few lessons that day a couple of people came into the classroom and looked around and observed what was going on. I didnt really feel nervous since I didn't feel like anything was weighted on me. So I just did my normal thing. But what made me kind of irritated was that my teacher was supposed to tell me that I was going to sub for another teacher for an hour while she attended a meeting, but my teacher never told me. So one of the other teachers had me to go the office to make some copies for her and as I was walking out, I heard someone ask me if I was Mrs. Betro's student teacher. So I said yes and she told me I was supposed to watch her class. So I did. It was a second grade class and they were working on a packet. They worked really well and asked questions when they needed help. They were a very good class. It was well organized and clean. After that I went back to the classroom and helped the students during the rotation. We went to recess and did the normal routines. After lunch I was asked by the other kindergarten teacher if I could help her with her rotation. So I went in and helped her students add and draw the dominos. It was fun to work with another group of students. That was pretty much my day!"

"event","Today I came in and met Mrs. Betro in her classroom. I asked her is she needed any help with any prep stuff before the class came in. She gave me some stuff she wanted me to do with the first graders during the rotation time. Then the students came in and did their morning routine and their lesson. They talked about different types of signs. Again, I was not introduced to the new students. Then the student did their rotation. I worked with the first graders and re re-read the story but looked for contractions. I had the students write out the contractions. Then it was time for recess so we took the students out to the playground. I talked with some students and played some activities with them. I did not talk with the teacher again. After recess, the students went back into the classroom and the teacher read them a story about Spring. Then the students left and switched rooms for ELD and to sing songs and do calendar activities. I went and sand with the students then went to work with the ELD group. They were learning about different body parts and they were supposed to draw and color pictures of their bodies. Then the students went to lunch. We waited for the first graders to come back, and they read a story. After the story, we went to lunch. I had lunch with the teachers in the teachers lunge again and then went to pick up the students at the playground. We went to room 13 again since the PM kindergarten students use room 1. The students did language arts and math. They started a new chapter in math about measurements. At this point I still have not talked to the teacher . I do not really like it because I do not have much interaction with with students and I am just sitting there bored. She is not very friendly or seems like she wants a student teacher. The teacher is strict with the students. She seems like she has very little patience for the students. At one time she can be really nice and a second later she can be cold! After just sitting there for 2 hours, it was then time to go home. We took the students back to the classroom so they can pack up and go home. I waited outside with some of the students until they were picked up by their parents. I couldn't find the teacher when I got back so the other teacher told me it was okay for me to go home."

"event","It was my first day of student teaching today. I got to school really early so I decided to drive around for a bit and get some Starbucks. I came back to Harrison Elementary at about 7:15 and met the principal's secretary, Donna. She knew who I was and told me that my teacher, Mrs. Betro was not in yet and she let me to the teachers lounge. I felt kind of awkward since it wasn't really my territory and I didn't know anyone. So anyways I wait in the teachers lounge until Mrs. Betro comes in and introduces herself to me and we go to her classroom, Room 1. She teaches a combo class of kinder and first grade. She didn't really talk much while she was getting things ready before the students came in. When the bell rang, she went outside and lined the students up and brought them into the classroom. The students got some paperwork to give to the teacher and sat on their assigned letters on the carpet. They started doing their review of the letter of the week and some addition. All this time, the teacher still did not introduce me to the class. The students kept looking at me and some even asked me if I was a parent helper. It was not until they were ready to do their rotation was I introduced. And can you believe the teacher didn't even remember my name! She put me with a group of students who were supposed to be coloring pictures that started with the letter D and Z. After rotations, the students went to recess. The teacher again didn't talk to me while she went on with her normal routines. I watched the students play in the playground until recess was over. They came back in and after a few minutes, the students were split for ELD and it seemed really chaotic and I was not told any instructions or what was going on. Instead I just followed my teacher to another room where about 3 or 4 classes were combined to sing songs and talk about the calendar. They sang songs about the alphabet and their numbers. Then it was lunchtime. I ate with the other teachers in the lounge . I didn't really have a lunch so I just ate some crackers.After lunch, the kinder students already went home so it was only the 3 1st graders since 1 was absent. The teacher was now able to work with them closely. There they did a lot of worksheets. This was the most boring part of the day. I  did not do anything at all. I was not even acknowledged. Once they were done, it was time to go home so we walked back to their classroom (room 1). They packed up their stuff were taken outside by the teacher. After the students went home, I spoke with Mrs. Betro about the program and she answered any questions I had. Then I left for the day!"

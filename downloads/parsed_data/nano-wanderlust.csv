"event","Muses in myth
<p>
According to Pausanias there were three original Muses: Aoide (""song"", ""voice""), Melete (""practice"" or ""occasion"") and Mneme (""memory"") (Paus. 9.29.1). Together, they form the complete picture of the preconditions of poetic art in cult practice. In Delphi three Muses were worshipped as well but with other names: Nete , Mesi and Hypate which are the names of the three chords of the ancient musical instrument lyre. In later tradition, the fourth Muse, Arche, was also considered.
<p>
The canonical nine Muses are:
<p>
    * Calliope (epic poetry)
    * Euterpe (music)
    * Clio (history)
    * Erato (lyric/love poetry)
    * Melpomene (tragedy)
    * Polyhymnia (sacred poetry)
    * Terpsichore (dancing)
    * Thalia (comedy)
    * Urania (astronomy)

<p>
Together, they form a complete picture of the subjects proper to poetic art in the archaic period. However, the association of specific muses with specific art forms is a later innovation.
<p>
In Roman, Renaissance and Neoclassical art, Muses depicted in sculptures or paintings are often distinguished by certain props or poses, as emblems. Euterpe (music) carries a flute; Calliope (epic poetry) carries a writing tablet; Clio (history) carries a scroll and books; Erato (lyric poetry) is often seen with a lyre and a crown of roses; Melpomene (tragedy) is often seen with a tragic mask; Polyhymnia (sacred poetry) is often seen with a pensive expression; Terpsichore (dancing) is often seen dancing and carrying a lyre; Thalia (comedy) is often seen with a comic mask; and Urania (astronomy) carries a staff pointed at a celestial globe.

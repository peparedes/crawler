<h2>Your Hottest Body Part is Your <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/legs.html"">Legs</a>!</h2>
You have legs, and you know how to use them.<br>
You've got the legs of a dancer or model - shapely and sexy.<br>
You can make a miniskirt sing as you walk down the street.<br>
Whether you're pimping it in high heels or just wearing gym shorts, you always look great.<br>
Wrapping your legs around your man's back always makes you feel great :-)<br>
You could make a fortune as a leg model.<br>
<br>
Celebs who work their legs as hard as you do include: Cameron Diaz, Elle McPherson, Catherine Zeta Jones, and of course, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.<br>
<br>
Want to play up your legs even more?<br>
Let them show, baby! Short skirts, micro shorts, fishnets... you know the deal.<br>
And keep  your legs super looking by getting a fake or real tan - covers any little flaws you might have!

"event","Today was not a very good day all. so, i got in a huge fight with my parents and now they're not letting me go to leavenworth with j-dub. :(. im really sad because we had been looking forward to it forever! im also pretty upset because one of my little kids might get expelled from school. for all of you who don't know, i volunteer at gregory heights a couple times a week and i get to work with the cutest little kids ever. it is honestly one of the most fufilling things i think i have ever done, it makes me feel so good about myself, like im actually making a difference. anyways, today one of the little boys i help (carlos) got in a fight with another little boy (jonathon) and ended up breaking his nose. i had to break up their fight and then carry jonathon to the office. he was beaten up pretty bad too, there was blood all over his face and clothes. and im just really, really worried that carlos is going to get expelled. even though he didn't start the fight, since he has a bad history with beating up other kids, he might be the one to get in major trouble. it makes me so sad because carlos is the most adorable and sweet little boy and i will miss him so much!
    Alright, so there was one good part about today, i finally asked elliott to semi and he said yes (of course!) im excited because i know we are going to have so much fun, especially since he's nominated for junior prince. so hopefully he will win and i won't even have to pay for tickets... score... lol. im exhausted so im going to bed, sweet dreams."

"event","so...today was fun. i went shopping downtown with j-dub and erica and i got some clothes and my semi dress and shoes.  ( i know, i know it's a little early but what ev.)i couldn't live without the shoes though. they're guess and adorable... black and 4(!) inches. that makes me 5'11! ahh! now i just need to get a tall date ;). anyways,  the coolest part about today was seeing gavin and a bunch of guys we met up at crystal last year. gavin was a lot cuter (fuck it kelly youngberg you were right!) without his boarding stuff on. actually... he looked a lot like ricky merell, and any of you who know who that is have to agree with me when i say that's a GOOD thing. anyways...tonight has been boring so far, my parents are currently having ANOTHER dinner party. so, im sitting in my room with my dog, hershey, because there's this phsyco lady downstairs who likes to grab his tail, poor little thing. hopefully tonight tonight will be fun though."

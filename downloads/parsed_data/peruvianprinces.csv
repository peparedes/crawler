for gordon....

i hate crying 
when its you hurt
i hate feeling
when its you who has none left

why do i absorb the tears
that you refuse to release

if you find your way home
no one will be inside

and there wont be a key under the mat.





im cleaning up
no more trashy partying
no more waking up with regret
i need something different"

"event","well today is thursday...late start...i love the late starts

had an alright day

it seems like everyone is talking about prom its really annoying

yesterday something was mentioned...""$20,000 for a prom! you could feed a small country with that!""

and it i thought...we could!!!! we fucking could!!!

what the fuck will ONE prom do..!???

when ther are billions of people who dont have one meal...one fucking meal

while 600 kids are gonna dress up, get gift bags with photo albums they will never use

champaigne* glasses they will never use ...

how the fuck does that make sense

boycott prom

its a fucked up hedonistic ritual that i refuse to take part in

it doesnt make any fucking sense 

its a holiday for cheerleaders and big necked jocks

fuck them

i would much rather see a country, with more food, less aids, and a bit more to smile about
....
makes a little more sense dont it?

<P>&nbsp;sometimes i forget how happy and content i should be to have the family that i do.</P>
<P>&nbsp;i think we all forget.</P>
<P>&nbsp;no matter what they say, no matter what we say.</P>
<P>&nbsp;these are the people that last. they mold you, you mold them...in a way you just become one big mold, and its weird how you all fit together perfectly no matter how different you all are. </P>
<P>when i think of my how much my family is i cry i dont know why, it just hurts to be have that much love and be that much more vulnerable. </P>
<P>then my mom.... my mom would love me if i killed 800 people...&nbsp;thats&nbsp;insane isnt it? </P>
<P>i think most moms would... </P>
<P>now who the fuck would love osama? .....his momma! (i didnt mean for that to rhyme) </P>
<P>(i am such a fag) </P>
<P>a letter to my friend, you know who ya are, </P>
<P>i am so sorry for what happened and i am glad you guys are not giving up im sorry for a lot of things, i wish i could change for you but i want you to know that im happy for you because you are the best friend i have ever had... and thats weird cause i know i can trust you no matter what and no friend has ever offered me that i hope your life is wonderful, and i know it will be because i cant imagine life for you anything less than absolute brilliance and amazing ;) if you ever need anything from me just say it cause i owe you my life (even though you do owe me your life x 100) </P>

Some junior fuckfaces thought it would be funny to spread that around.  Which made me cry and punch a lot of stuff because....well..because i hate lesbians and the very thought of people thinking i was one made me want to vomit, then shoot myself in the foot.  but oh well, high school will be high school...i am finally making a decision in my life and moving to florida, where i will be moving in an apartment with my friend kelly and we will be attending fullsail, which is one of the top film schools in america....so thats exciting!  oh and im goin to peru for 3 months from september to november, so that is awesome, i will surf, sleep, and eat, and maybe poop, i dont know for sure on that one yet

**things she WISHES you knew**

** Saying ""I love you"" immediately before, during, or after sex doesn't count.

** Real men drive stick

** I will leave if you lie.

** You are cute in raglan-sleeved T-shirts (two-toned baseball undershirts)

** I'm convinced I'm pregnant and obsess about it for 24 to 48 hours before my period, even when I have no reason to think so.

** I love it when you hug me from behind and whisper into my ear.

** ""Fine"" is never an appropriate response when I ask you how I look.

** Most of the time when I fantasize, it's about you.

** I'm terrified of becoming my mother, even though I admire her.

** I get turned on simply seeing that I have an e-mail from you. 

** I expect you to call me.

** Only rock stars are allowed to wear leather pants.

** I'm scared of losing my independance.

** I'm more forgiving of you than I should be.

** You did something bad. I seem cool with it. I'm not.

**Shoes determine whether you're fashionable or not. 

** I own a Debbie Gibson CD and I'm not afraid to use it.

** When I compare my tummy to a kangaroo pouch, say nothing. 

** A man I love plans the occassional fancy-shmancy dress up sate and impromptu weekend getaways, and he buys my favorite candy in advance when we're just going to the movies.

** You look hot in hooded clothing items.

** You should never tell me what to do.

** If I slept over, you owe me breakfast.

**If you ask me out directly, I will say yes.

** I'm very impressed when you ask for my advice. 

** I'm unimpressed with a man who doesn't take the lead.

** When in doubt, go with a shirt that matches your eye color.

** I want to be Madonna.

**I'm in heaven when you hold my hand.

** You're sexy when you're shaving, fixing stuff, wearing white T-shirts and jeans, driving, eating a peach, and holding a baby.

** I need to hear how you feel about me. OFTEN. Tell me now.

** Suprises, especially gifts for me = MORE LOVING.

** I want to be the best thing that's ever hapened to you. And for you to recognize this.

** If I'm not feeling loved, I will start looking...

** Discussion of ex-bf's and ex-gf's should be avoided at all costs.

** I like it when you tell me what you're thinking even if you don't know yourself.

** Celebrating our anniversary, even if it's only been a few months, earns major bonus points.

** I love it when you're sweaty. 

** It's best to consult your gal-pals for gift ideas.

** A lady should always be greeted with kisses.

**It's cheating as soon as you're doing something with her that you wouldn't want me to see, hear, read...

** For the record: I'd rather you break up with me than cheat.

** I remember EVERYTHING from our relationship.

**You should know all this without me telling you."

last night i talked to josh..the ex..and he still is crazy.  he ""just wants me to love him""  i told him i can only be his friend and he said that i hurt him a lot..  :(  my dad called and he said he wanted to hang out with me today so that was cool.. i feel like i don't really have parents, its depressing.  but my parents love me a lot and I know that, they just don't agree with a lot of what I do.  I really feel bad for Bobbie, shes my baby, I hope she starts feeling better soon..  today is the last day of the semester and i am happy but sad.  i have

I stayed the night....I am really grateful for her...and Oprah, without those two.... I dont know where I would be.  i had a dream the other night that the devil was in my room and he was strangling me and throwing me around and I kept on praying to Jesus but it only made it worse, but somehow I knew that if I kept praying he would sometime have to stop.  He was this skinny dark shadow with kind of a skinny long face, but I couldn't see anything, no detail, I could only feel his eyes.  I lost my breath and started screaming but no one could hear me.  My nightmares always have that, where I scream, but nothing comes out, and no one knows whats going on.  It makes me cry when I finally wake up, I don't know why.  I have to return all of Josh's stuff to him today, and I wrote him a letter...I hope he is fine.  I don't know what i am doing with my life...this really sucks

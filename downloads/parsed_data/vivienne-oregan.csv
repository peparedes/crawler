"event","Enjoyed the BBC show. The Secret Life of the Cat, shown last week in which 50 cats wore GPS and some cameras to follow their daily and nightly activities.

One of the findings was that quite a few cats were gaining extra food by using cat flaps to visit there people's homes and steal food from other cats. This was said to be a new surprising finding.

Really? I've had cats visiting and stealing food for years. Indeed, it was how cats like Shaman and more recently Biggie came to live here after being visitors. I can't believe that other owners are not aware of this issue."

I have been active on live journal since 2001 but under usernames that do not reflect my given name. However, I wished to reserve this name as I am in the process of reactivating my website and wanted a contact point for the future."

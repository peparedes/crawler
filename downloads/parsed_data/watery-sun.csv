"event","It's been way too long since I posted anything here.  A good example of how life gets away from us and we get caught up in the day to day drama.  Kids to school, work, tv shows, making supper and bed.  It can become all so routine and life just slips away from us.  Time to slow down... take a moment to reflect.  What is it that life means anyway?  What am I grateful for?  I don't want to spend so much time reflecting on what I can't change anymore because it takes way too much energy.  Maybe I will begin to use this space to think about some of the things I can change.  Oh I don't mean war and things like that.  I won't give them precious energy either.  I will give positive things energy though.... like change, like love, like peace.  If enough people start talking and thinking about the positive things in the world the energy will grow and the world will get better.  That is my goal."

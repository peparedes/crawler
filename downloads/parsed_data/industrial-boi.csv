I can't keep up with all the different formats to blog with these days.

I don't know which one I like, but I know in two years or less, something new will come out that will have all your blogging/instant messaging/video conferencing/gaming/chatting/dating needs.  So until then! lol.

I love life.

I miss my friends that I haven't seen in ages."

"event","I went and saw VAST last Thursday in Hollywood and Friday in Santa Ana.  They were both awesome shows, and I found myself feeling really at home with my old friends.  It was definitely a good experience for me.

So, I'm jamming today with Wes, the newest edition to the band -- guitarist/bassist and writer.  We've jammed a few times in the past and gone over a lot of material and I see only good things in the future.

I need one more band member.  Ideally, a bassist/guitarist who can sing.  The band is into the whole 'switching up' of instrumentation.

We currently have about 25 tunes to pick from, but we want to focus on 8-9 tunes to polish for a good live show, even if we only get to choose a few of them.

Life is moving along at a steady pace and it's time for me to kick it all up a notch."

I've got great material going on the music front.  Things that I feel really capture the essence of my creative side.  I am content and busy.  Yet I still have an open schedule.  Anyone need a new employee? ;)"

"event","Well, life is strange.

It always is.

My current relationship is faltering... which is really lame considering that I haven't.  But, unfortunately, when one person isn't ready for a relationship no matter what the other person does, they can't 'fix' the problem.

So, I'm just confused and hurt, but ready to take charge of my life.  

Currently, I have offers from 4 different venues in Austin to play shows as Silent Echoes, so I'm getting a makeshift band together so that I can play a few gigs and drop my name around town.  Now this does NOT mean that I will be any less involved with VAST!  Hopefully, if -my- band works out like it should, you'll be seeing Silent Echoes open up for VAST on the road.

Is this what I thought I'd be doing AT ALL??? No.  But life's funny that way.  

So...  I may be staying in Austin for another couple of months.... instead of going back to San Diego at the end of March, it looks like I'll be back there the first week in June... or whatever.  We'll see what happens.

And who knows... I might even be joining the single world again soon.

because you've broken your back.
Beating your own will down,

A hunger kindles the embers

To spill it on the sand.

Chasing my own tail
eroding away the world below me
Feeding the parasite
Starving myself as it swallows me alive.

"event","Introspective again, sitting, fearing, loathing, clawing.  The same bullshit, the same drama, the same poignant idiocy.  Random and fleeting.

I find it funny that my entire life, I've been fed my own insecurities by other people and never really interpreted them for myself until after high school.  It's been years, and now I look back. I reflect upon the mirror of what I am and what I have been.  I was always told that I was a late bloomer.  I lost my virginity at 18. I smoked pot for the first time at 19.  I went to college at 20.  The more I look back, the more I realize that they were wrong.  They made me believe what wasn't true. That I was blooming later than everyone, that I was behind in development, and that I couldn't tell my ass from my face.  The reality is - that from the ages of 10-17, I watched.  I grew in ways that showed me the world.  I found wisdom, honour and courtesy.  I may have passed up other things, but they came to me later... not as a late bloomer, but as a mature boy finding himself launched into a man's world - and finding peace within combining what I found and embracing what was to come.

I'm proud of myself, and look towards the future with an open heart, no matter how many nails get driven into it.

Odd moods, odd events. Life is changing."

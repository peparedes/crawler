"event","Miss Marple as portrayed by:

1. Joan Hickson:
She's about 80 years old, retired and just taking it easy. In her youth she was probably a spy/intelligence operative in the ass kicking department, so solving the occasional quadruple homicide is nothing. She was never the fem-fatal, but she's done her share of sexing.
She's deliberately vague and spinsterish, so naturally nobody suspects a thing. She managed to become a respected and known personage within the village; no one questions her past.
Inspector Slack is probably an ex-lover. She taught him everything about sex, then dumped him, hence his animosity towards her. Alternatively, he's the result of an affair she had with a foreign spy she was forced to kill. She wouldn't have had to time to raise him, and he hasn't forgiven her for giving priority to the job.
If he isn't her son, then I see him as the illegitimate son of Mr. Raphael.
Dear nephew Raymond is code-name for the British government, who take very good care of her, or else.

2. Geraldine McEvan:
She's in her late 60s-early 70s. She's pretty much retired and deeply entrenched withing the community of St. Mary Mead, to the point of having a reputation for sleuthing. It appears that she lost the love of her life during the war. She's probably had many relationships, but never got over that first loss.
She spent some time working for the government, probably to do with national security.
Despite being retired, she's still greatly interested in murder. She must be incredibly bored.
She also occasionally sleeps with her inspectors.

3. Julia McKenzie:
Mid to late 60s, still deeply involved with the home office and espionage. She often uses her feminine wiles on the young, unsuspecting inspectors. Before they know it, they're already snared.
Inspector Finch becomes her partner and lover. He might propose marriage in the future, though there is no guarantee that she will accept.

Holmes:

1. Russian Holmes:
He's probably asexual as himself, and very open to just about anything whenever he's in one of his costumes. Watson is gay, though he likes female company and women generally find him attractive. He's very fond of Mary, but is in love with Holmes, who returns that love but thinks Watson is better off with Mary. Mary, in turn, is seeking a marriage of convenience. Her health prevents her from ever having children. She finds herself very happy with Watson.

2. 2009 Holmes movie:
Holmes and Watson have both screwed through the continents. Everyone and everything they found attractive. Watson falls in love with Mary, and Holmes is very jealous. He's not in love with John, but he's very possessive and selfish. I think eventually he will see just how awesome Mary is and they'll become friends. Maybe a threesome?"

"event","I seriously need to re-read that book very soon, because I must be crazy. I don't know why Jay/Nick do it for me, but just the thought of the together is on the same level as online stocking browsing. In other words, unf. Maybe it's the unrequited pathetic love and the stupidity of Gatsby's attempt to hold on to Daisy's ghost. Maybe it's Nick's inactivity and inability to grow a pair, grab Gatsby and shake him until he comes down from whatever fantasy he's been living in. Maybe it's Jordan, who should have had the brains to beat some sense into both their heads, and even more so should have had the sense not get married. Maybe it's Tom and Daisy being disgusting and horrible. I think mostly it was the right place/time sort of deal. Somehow The Great Gatsby made an impression in my scull and combined with all the other shit I've read over the years to create an interesting tingling sensation whenever the book comes up. By extension, the adaptations have the same effect."

"event","Inception:
The movie introduced several cool characters and interesting ideas which it never explored. Who are those crazy fuckers who go on this quest, with Cobb of all people? Don't they know he's unhinged? He only has his dead wife showing up and screwing missions, so clearly everything's fine.
Naturally it sparked a huge fandom, where no two interpretations of any given character are alike. On one hand, that means that everyone can find their favorite version, but on the other hand this movie failed at characterization.
As for the premise? Who cares? Half the fics are AUs or take place in the waking world, so it's a moot point, and I'm not even getting any crazy dream porn.

The Queen:
Never did I think that: Queen Elizabeth II + Tony Blair = PORN&nbsp;NOW&nbsp;PLEASE&nbsp;YES&nbsp;GOD!
Then I saw Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen play those roles.
To me it's endlessly re-watchable, because it's a personal story showing almost every character in the best possible light. I get to root for characters I like, and get a happy (sort of) ending out of it.
Watching it with my dad was torture; every five minutes he had to break in with an anti-monarchist comment or an impromptu history lesson.
Spare me the politics and just give me more Helem Mirren and Michael Sheen in a movie together! I think I need to start a campaign. 

Frost/Nixon:
Mr. Tarantino, please take note: this is how you built tension with dialogue; this is how you draw your audience and make them shout at the screen. Also, they made the fake documentary thing work. Now I need to make myself look for the real interviews.

The Damned United:
It's a story about friendship and one man getting over his ego. And football, but I don't care about that. It jumps between past and present, and somehow makes that work. We also get to know these characters very well, so by the time we see their fallout we're already hoping for a reconciliation. When that happens, it's a stand-up-and-cheer moment. Thought partially it's because on his own Michael Sheen's character is a complete asshole. (Wanted to say twat, but not sure if appropriate).

Leon the Professional:
This movie handled their love story just right. There were so many pitfalls where it could have stumbled and crashed, but it held firm (and here I want to make a &quot;professional&quot; pun, but I'll refrain). Also, Gary Oldman as a strung out crazy person is pretty entertaining, but I still like him better as &quot;secretly BAMF&quot; Jim Gordon.

Ponyo:
Why didn't it break my heart? That's what the Little Mermaid is for! Or, if we're talking Disney Little Mermaid, why wasn't it cute and uplifting? It was pretty, but the plot (if it can be called that) just didn't make sense. So, Liam Neeson's character is going to destroy the world? And the &quot;test of true love&quot; was asking the kid if he was going to take care of Ponyo? What? And why did she keep falling asleep towards the end? Oh, and the end credits song made me want to kill myself.

Taken/The A-Team:
So here's what actually happened:
Liam Neeson is an ex-CIA/black ops/whatever living in France with French-Secret-Service-Guy, his wife and their kids. He gets a call from his ex-wife/girl-friend/random-one-night-stand who tells him that her daughter was kidnapped in France by some Albanians because they want ransom from/revenge on her rich husband.
Because French-Secret-Service-Guy was already onto the Albanians for sex/drugs related crimes, Lieam Neeson gets involved in the case. That, and his name is actually Badass Motherfucker Kick-Your-Ass-Ovich and he trained Batman and James Bond, so he's contractually obligated to do it.
He then calls in his team from back in the day, and they're a combination of the A-Team guys and the guys from the Taken movie. From then on it's cool fights, hacking, explosions, vehicle chases and guns.
Liam Neeson saves the day/girl/country and returns to his little family.
The end.

Salt:
After thinking long and hard I have to say: This movie can suck my metaphorical balls! Fuck this.

The Hangover:
Meh. It wasn't as filthy or as nasty as I feared, but it wasn't the best thing since sliced bread either. Bradley Cooper's pretty hot though, and that one song by Flo Rida (took me a while to get, actually) is catchy. Also, tiger in the bathroom. Lolz? Eh.

Scott Pilgrim V. The World:
Visually awesome. A very fun movie watching experience. Was there a plot or a deeper statement about the hipster culture and relationships? Maybe. Does it matter? No. Dudes exploded into coins when you hit them with a sword!"

I also love his voice and the semi lisp. And that mouth...<br /><br />Of course they have to go and kill him, though this <em>is</em> Supernatural, so it's possible he'll come back. Hell, I don't even care about the show, nor have I seen a single episode, but now I'm considering renting the ones with him, just to see.

I want to be able to draw again, to get this itch out of my blood and into the paper. I want to be in control of what passes from my brain to the page via my hand and eye. I want to sleep and wake up to see my life has began, and not in the process of beginning. I want to be 30."

"event","<strong>Inglourious Basterds:</strong> The first time I watched it, I could not understand why it exists. I was all ready to forget about it, but for the whole following week all I could think about was watching it again. So, I bought and re-watched it several times. Here are my conclusions and thoughts:<br /><br />1. This movie only exists because Q.T wanted to make it.<br />2. Christoph Waltz is made of win, but I wish he'd tone down with the &quot;eccentric villain&quot; thing.<br />3. Eli Roth and Z.Q -- separated at birth?<br />4. The milk in Chapter 1 kept moving around from shot to shot. I read that the sloppy editing is an homage to old Westerns, but sloppy is sloppy.<br />5. According to the Interents, the movie got some of the numbers/uniforms wrong. Now it bothers me that they didn't do their research properly.<br />6. The phone cord could not have been curled.<br />7. However, other anachronisms didn't bother me, mostly because I was too ignorant to notice.<br />8. OMG&nbsp;GIDEON&nbsp;B&nbsp;IS&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;MOVIE!!! It helped me get over losing Moser and finally accept Alex into my heart and TV. So now I need to get ALL of the Inspector Rex DVDs. It will cost an arm and a leg. Oh well.<br />9. Bowie is a God.<br />10. Shoshanna, honey, SHOOT&nbsp;HIM&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;HEAD!<br />11. People on IMDB know nothing about Jewish Kosher laws.<br />12. Also Raine/Brad Pitt: I want to say I hated him, but I didn't.<br />13. Bridget, Bridget. That choking scene was...<br />14. Stiglitz/Hicox/Hellstorm<br />15. Hicox on his knees in front of Bridget, pleasuring her.<br />16. Mountain climbing? How about: I stepped on my long dress with my giant heels, tripped and fell (possibly down some stairs)? Landa knew it was her, but <em>she</em> didn't know he knew.<br />17. Landa actually believed the Basterds wouldn't kill him the moment they cross to Allied territory? I was surprised he got away with only the Swastika scar. Fanfic has filled me in on what else the Basterds might have felt was an appropriate punishment. I almost feel guilty about enjoying those fics.<br />18. 100 Nazi scalps. And he <em>wants</em> his scalps.<br />19. Subtitle/foreign language 'gasm/love.<br />20. Epic Angels and Demons/Inglourious Basterds crossover, where they all somehow work/pass thorough the same Airport. There is a murder and an evil plot to either kill the Pope, steal the antimatter, or get everyone and their cousin laid. Possibly all of the above. Illuminati, Nazis, spies and turncoats are everywhere, and there is no telling whom to trust. But never fear, Inspector Rex is on the case!"

"event","I was in a store which was a combination of Home Depot, Michaels, and a petting zoo. I've been there before when it was a reptile selling store -- mostly snakes and the lizards. Now they had lots of fish. The fish were dieing of some sort of bloating disease, and it was somehow related to the water they were swimming in. So I was trying to figure out what made them die, and find a nice bulletin board. Then, David Bowie shows up, dressed as The Goblin King, but older, and offered his help. I told him that I appreciate the help and that I pretty much think he's awesome. He was cool about it and we went on with our investigation. But then I woke up. Boo."

"event","So here I am, reading a nice gen fic wherein people are hugging or touching or cuddling for whatever platonic reasons, when suddenly the author decides to add the words &quot;there was nothing sexual about the hugging/cuddling/touching&quot; or a variation thereof. Few things that can break a moment and turn my mind towards the gutter as quickly as this little disclaimer. Either the author assumes all of the readers are colossal perverts/have their shipping goggles on so tightly they sleep and bathe in them, or the author actually wants to write the scene with shippy implications but for whatever reason doesn't and this is a Freudian slip of sorts.

I read this short fic where Rodney had a completely retarded cat whom he loved, and it broke my heart. It wasn't even good. 

What I look for in fic:
&gt; Gender-switch: Sometimes, it makes so much sense, and sometimes it's done for great LOLZ. I can appreciate both.
&gt; Complete reworking of the characters in a different universe/time period/whatever. I know it's basically an original fic with familiar characters, but that's what I love about it. Including but not limited to alternate history, changed back-stories and the apocalypse. You know there is always one with an apocalypse.
&gt; Someone/everyone is an animal: usually done for crack reasons. Hell, ALWAYS done for crack reasons, but some of those fics are gold.
&gt; Time travel: Past selves meeting future selves? Future selves coming back to fix/fuck up? Yes please. There was this one fic where Harry was actually Snape through the power of time travel failure. It sucked and made no sense, but I wish the author had finished it.
&gt; Not a complete reworking, but contains major differences: What if gay marriage/being a furry/communism/cross-dressing/Mpreg were common and accepted practices in world society? How would it change religion/politics/pop-culture and how would it change the characters? Alternatively, what if driving cars/pants/speaking French/being a Republican/sexual reproduction were taboo? I guess the sexual reproduction thig was a big part of Brave New World, but it was a completely different universe altogether.
&gt; Fic set in another canon universe: So, Stargate being set in the Star Wars universe, and etc. Can recreate the plot of either universe, or just use the new world as a backdrop.
&gt; Mpreg: it doesn't have to be explained. I don't need charts and paragraphs dedicated to how it's possible because I don't give a crap. I also don't want to read about the subsequent kid/children, except for this one Stargate Atlantis fic, but that wasn't even Mpreg, it was baby-conceived-through-Ancient-technology.
&gt; Sentinel AU: in itself a wide category, since different authors have different views of the Sentinel/Guide bond and of the abilities each possesses, not to mention their place in society, both of fellow Sentinel/Guides and normal humans. But the gist is that the Sentinel had enhanced senses and needs the Guide to help them control said senses. The Guide is a sort of spiritual/Shaman figure, and many authors add empathic abilities as well. Also, each has a spirit animal, and some authors consider the Wolf Guide to be the most powerful.
&gt; BDSM AU: I actually read this for the interaction and people wearing collars, not to mention a society with practically no sexual taboos. The sex itself is sort of weird. I especially want to know how Religion operates in such a world. Would something like Judaism or Christianity even come into being, and if so would they be even more hard-core about abstinence, or would they be all about the orgies?
&gt; Someone/everyone is an alien/different species. Usually works best if it's only one or two people.
&gt; Guilty pleasures: people meeting AU version of themselves and having shenanigans.
&gt; Fix it fics: I love fandom for its ability to be in denial/rage filled writing binges about the death/mistreatment of a character. The CSI Miami fic still includes Speed, and he died in Season 1.

Naturally, most of those are more or less AUs. That's because I love me some AU fic.

Big NOs:
1. Baby death: don't do it.
2. Angst for the sake of angst: I'm looking at you Harry Potter fandom, though you're not the only one by a long shot. I get the tendency to torture your favorite character, I really do, but that doesn't mean that they need to get randomly raped/kidnapped and beaten/have their back-story made more tragic. Enough is enough.
3. Bandom fics: it's a scary dark pit of 15 year old girls writing about rape and cutting, populated by cliches, unforgivable grammatical errors and a twisted understanding of reality and human emotions.
4. High school AUs: most of them are shit, despite the potential the setting has.

Can't think of more at the moment.

It's raining."

"event","Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and RDJ's portrayal of Sherlock. But he will never be my Holmes, and this will never be my Holmes movie. Firstly it's because I'm unable to disentangle myself from my nostalgic love towards the Russian Holmes/Watson team of epic win. Yes, I know that the film quality was kinda shit, but it was filmed in the late 70s and early 80s, so it has this retro feel to it. The acting is good, the music is memorable and catchy, and I think they had budget and locations and stuff. Also, the BEST Mrs. Hudson ever. Of all time. Full stop.<br />It never occurred to me to ship that version of the guys, though Watson is incredibly gay. I actually only ever read fanfic based on the books, which for me were always a different universe altogether, so it didn't overlap in my head and rape my childhood. I never really pictured book Holmes and Watson as the actors in the Russian show, though I watched it before reading.<br />I've never really shipped Holmes/Watson. Naturally I delved into the fandom once I found it, but the fics didn't really leave an impression, though this could be a testimony to their quality as much as to my feelings towards the ship. I am sort of excited about the fandom reboot with the new movie (and it's not a revival, because I'm pretty sure the old fans would rather cut off their right arm than admit the film had any merit) but as with most new fandoms most of the writing is shit and I just can't be assed to care.<br />Now, RDJ for me will always be Harry Lockhart (and Harry Potter all grown up in my bizarre AU head-canon), and even though his Holmes was cool and the movie was shiny and explode-y I just didn't buy it. In my mind, this was just a role Harry got to play in the aftermath of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, or a dream he's had or something to that effect. It's Harry/Perry all the way.<br /><u>Tangent #1: </u>OK, so Harry can actually be Harry Potter in two ways:<br />1. He's never discovered that he was a wizard and ended up this pathetic deadbeat endearing guy. He moved to America and Harmony only thinks she knows him and he just rolls with it because despite not being a wizard he still has some magic. Or something.<br />2. In the end of the war Harry tuns of the America having killed Voldemort. Now he's trying to live as a muggle, but finds that he has no marketable skills, so he becomes a thief. The rest is the same. Perry can be a squib.<br /><u>Tangent #2:</u> Jude Law:<br />I don't like the smug bastard, with two notable exceptions:<br />1. <u>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow:</u> He spent most of the movie opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, which automatically made him 10 times more likable. Anyhow, I like that movie and he doesn't actively ruin it for me, thanks to the awesome that is Giovanni Ribisi who plays Dex.<br />2. <u>Holmes 2009:</u> He made a good Watson; just like the Russian one, but with 300% more ass kicking."

"event","My Casablanca is Transporter 2. Just think about it: Frank gets sucked into a situation he wants nothing to do with, while the potential love interest and her man are in constant danger. Inspector Tarconi takes the role of Louis -- the opposing force turned ally. Frank doesn't get the girl, but he does save the day and bad guys get shot. So, just like Casablanca, but fewer Nazis and the visas are a kid.<br /><br />More about Angels and Demons: There is no interesting fanfic (except for one that I'm saving for a rainy day), so I'm left alone with my imagination, and that's dangerous. This movie is sort of my LOTR in that I want the guys and Vittoria to go on an epic, evil-banishing quest. Obviously, Strauss is Gandalf, and I don't care enough about LOTR to carry this comparison further. Also, I can't stand hobbits, but that's Frodo's fault.<br />Anyhow, I just want them to have shenanigans together, and be alive and not evil. That would have been great. I know it's cliche and a really stupid idea, but I would pay to see just one fic where they are all stuck in an airport during a snowstorm for some reason. Actually, I just want them to be in The Terminal, so they can make it not suck. It's just not fair that most of them were dead towards the end of the film. I cared about those people!<br /><br />Mamma Mia: I have slash goggles that are...relentless, but I did not realize that Colin Firth's character was supposed to be gay. Nor did I think that he was, even when they hinted at it. Hell, even when he <strong>said</strong> that Donna was the first and last woman he has ever slept with, I just didn't get it. I thought all those looks people were leveling at him were to pity him for being celibate for all those years. It took me almost a minute to realize that he actually meant to say he was gay. Epic fail.<br /><br />Leap Year: Anna went through a journey and it changed her, so that she was no longer compatible with her boyfriend. It would have been out of character for her to pick Declan otherwise. Liked: Amy Adams, pretty scenery that wasn't trying to eye-fuck the audience, they kept Matthew Goode scruffy, light and fluffy worked well with serious and sad. Disliked: Was Amy Adams wearing too much makeup in certain scenes, or was that just me? The wedding party and the thing with the heel -- it's not my type of humor. Perplexed/impressed: Amy Adams must have legs like an athlete, because those heels were hurting me just by looking at them. I get it that she's supposed to be &quot;fish out of water,&quot; but come on! Sensible shoes FTW! Oh, and Louis was awesome."

Don't get me wrong, I like Angels and Demons, but I would like it more if they didn't kill off all of the characters and didn't make Patrick evil. I get it that he was evil in the book, but given as they didn't mind changing such things as HIS NAME and NATIONALITY, not to mention that they made him NOT the Pope's biological scientifically conceived son, I think they could have also made him NOT be the villain. Just saying.
Also, in my head-canon Father Simeon and Commander Richter are some sort of soul-mates and they raised Chartrand together. Why? Because in one scene Patrick was all in Richter's face about something, and then a few scenes later Father Simeon got back at him by being all up in HIS face, and we saw Richter suppress a smile in the background. Yes. I don't even care if it's an epic love affair or if they're just BFFs for life. I just think they'd make an awesome team. I mean, Simeon attacked Patrick when he got Richter shot, even though ALL the other people thought Richter was evil at this point. Which to me means that Richter told Simeon about his findings regarding Patrick. Meaning of course that he trusted Simeon.
Ok, rant about minor characters over, for now. Don't get me started on Inspector Olivetti and Claudio."

"event","Ok. This will be a list, because I've spent too much time on IMDB and their forum things always bring my piss to a boil. Yes, I know those two things aren't actually connected by any thread of logic.

1. RPF: Real Person Fiction. Why do people have an issue with this? If you think about it, any time you've wanted your friend to get together/break up with person X or fantasized about your Linguistics professor you've actually shipped real people. Granted those were people you have some personal knowledge of, but it's not like anyone is claiming the RPF is actually true, and if they are they should be sued. My point? Shut up about how RPF is wrong, because you're doing it too.

2. Linguistics/English professors: Sigh. I've had a few dreams/fantasies about various representatives of the above-mentioned species. Usually involving a bed and some hard core fucking, but with cuddling and talking about our feelings afterwords.

3. Slash goggles: There is nothing wrong with slash goggles.

4. Threesomes: Are the answer.

5. BDSM AU FTW: Because I believe in a world where you know who you are, and where the world recognizes and accepts you for that very same self.

6. Leap Year: I wants to see it. And I already created an elaborate BDSM AU scenario where Anna collars both guys and they spend three months in Dublin getting to know each other. Sexily.

7. Sex in movies: Shouldn't happen. It is not appropriate -- ever.

8. New Holmes: Amusing and filled with all that stuff I like: explosions, Mark Strong, RDJ, Holmes, slashy moments, a Watson who kick ass. On the other hand the story was weak and not even mysterious, and Irene Adler was...not annoying in herself, but I didn't like the actress. The character was fine. Also, Mary was awesome, though I do wish her outfits didn't make me think she'd turn out to be evil. I mean, obviously she wasn't going to, but the costume department clearly wasn't told that tidbit.

9. Avatar: Honestly? Meh. I don't regret seeing it or anything, and I did get the soundtrack, but that's because it's pretty and occasionally really hits the spot. Some scenes were breathtaking, haunting and beautiful. But I still find 3D a bit gimmicky; it's not quite there yet.

10. Family: It's very important to me to establish even nominal or superficial familial bonds with people. The same goes for my characters.

11. Clothes: Shopping for them online gets me sort of borderline hot and bothered. And if I look at stocking or long socks it turns into full arousal. But only when shopping online.

12. Penguins: They make every fandom better."

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">Dear whoever,
 
 I must begin by saying that I can no longer be an English major for the following reasons:
 a. My self-hatred has reached new and previously unheard of levels, and the only reason I don't seriously consider suicide as a viable option is my all consuming selfishness and laziness.
 
 b. I am fucking sick and tired talking about the same 5 &quot;deep and meaningful&quot; approaches to whatever books we're reading, which isn't surprising because --
 
 c. teachers keep picking the same fucking books that are about as interesting and innovative as the paper they're printed on.
 
 d. Heart of Darkness -- it's a book about how a continent is so evil that it turns the natives into either &quot;almost human&quot; savages or weak, easily oppressed/bought off body parts, and turns anyone who dares come from the outside into evil bastards who then proceed to dominate and abuse the aforementioned natives; then cry about it and rationalize how being away from &quot;civilization&quot; made them do it. Also, Marlow needs to stop thinking about Kurtz and all that stuff they didn't get to do to each other...at night...alone...in the dark, sexy, forbidden jungle...yes, I'm saying everyone is gay. And racist. And Eurocentric. Also the women are silent, powerless symbolized and idealized Madonna/Devil types, broken down into images and body parts. Oh, and everything is mysterious and uncanny. I think this pretty much summarizes every criticism of HOD ever. Wait, no Freud! Done. 
 
 Apocalypse Now is superior.
 
 My point -- this shit is boring and has been done to death; let&rsquo;s read &quot;Three Bags Full&quot; instead. It's a book about smart sheep who try to solve their owner's murder. Most of the narrative is seen from the sheep's view, there are fun and relate-able characters, the mystery drives the action and it's just plain fun. Why can't we read something fun? I didn't realize they take away the right to enjoy reading the moment they hand you the diploma.
 
 Maybe I should have just caved in and been an art major? I mean, I'm good at the whole drawing thing, and art majors are supposed to be edgy and/or crazy, and that's totally something I can do.
 
 I mean, all I want to do in life is work as a secretary, maybe have some children and procure a pet cat from the shelter, preferably while also owning some sort of abode.
 
 It feels like my parents constantly fluctuate between either thinking the Earth spins because I exist, or crushing disappointment. I know I'm just throwing this in, but it's 6 am and I haven't slept in 16 hours, which isn't as bad as I initially thought. 
 
 I officially feel better.</p></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

"event","<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><font size=""3"">I'm sick of my teachers treating us the students as if we were uneducated, bigoted, semi-retarded nimrods. Yes, there is a lot of stuff about history we don't know. Yes, there are a lot of stereotypes we may believe. And yes, we are ignorant. But we're 20 years old for God's sake! I mean, it's not like they teach you anything in high school. And I'm sorry, but not all of us are curious and spend days figuring out what effect any given event had on any given group of individuals or what every article in the Constitution has to say. Is that what they want from us, to say we're sorry for not being 110% involved in history and politics and the like? Will that make us human in their eyes? Well, in that case I'm SORRY! OK? I'm SORRY. Now can you stop talking to me like I'm retarded and can't tell my ass from my head? Please.</font></p>"

"event","Heh. Well, I do not update this often, but why not? Ok, first of all, I finally updated my DeviantArt account. Yeah, I got so tired of Elfwood. It takes them about an eternity.5 to update my pics. I swear, it shouldn't take that long. So yeah, I gave up. I like my DeviantArt, but my lappy does not, so we had a little chat and I threatened to start treating him like I did my other lappies...and play endless hours of British cop dramas. He saw reason and gave in. My scanner on the other hand is not so reasonable. It is a devil machine that hates humanity and rapes my art. Sigh. I am seriously not too happy with the quality of the scans...but what are you gonna do? Well, I want to get a nicer scanner, but like that' gonna happen in the next 10 years. Please.

The new semester begins soon and I'm gonna be taking art class. EW. Ok, just for the record, I have never received above a C in art class. The reason? I do not turn in my work because: a) I think it's a stupid project and I don't wanna do it, or b) I still think it's a stupid project, but I would have done it were I not instead watching porn/reading slash/drawing for my own amusement. So yeah. Still, I need the art credits, and there is this art class I am ACTUALLY interested in, but it's upper division and cannot be taken bla bla bla.

News? I cannot seem to make my lazy ass sit down for two seconds and color something. I have about 10-15 sketches in various stages of completion, but none of them are actually being finished. And there is a present that I was making, but I cannot seem to finish that either. Ugg. All I've wanted to do for the past few days was eat orange chicken and Mongolian beef from Panda Express, read a few good BOOKS (you know, real ones), and play Castlevania on my Gameboy Advance. But my mom keeps taking the car, rendering me unable to get to the mall (it would take me an hour to walk there), I have been disappointed by the last book I read (Wicked: bla bla, sex, bla bla, I'm so misunderstood, bla bla), and I cannot seem to locate my Castlevania game. Sigh. Not unhappy, really, just grumpy as hell.

The highlight of my day though is the fact that I am watching NCIS season 2 and I love that season. Sigh. I hate season 3 and I have not seen season 4. It's not the same without Kate and with Madame Director. Bla. Gag me with a spoon. Please. I cannot stand that woman. I'm a slash fan, for God's sake, I strongly dislike any on-screen romance, but this one is so...forced. Ok, sorry, I'm just hungry. And my credit card is acting up. Don't ask.

Oh, and I guess if anyone cares, my DeviantArt user name is: kienie

"event","Years have passed since I first joined. And guess what? I am still a pervy weirdo. At least I'm back together with Kaion. Yeah, we had a huge drama-y fight a few years back, but we made up. I realized a ton of things about myself lately. One of them is that although I am smart and everything, I just don't really care about education and the amount of degrees and credits I may receive. I mean, I suppose I should really care and all, but I honest to God can't master enough...whatever it is you need to care. Maybe my care-meter is broken or something. Hell, whatever the reason, my parents are really not happy about me flunking high school. But guess what? I don't honestly care. I wish I had money of my own now, so I could  finally leave. Don't misunderstand, my family situation is great and I have nothing at all to complain about, but I'm sick of completely relying on my parents for everything. They tell me how smart I am but they never listen to a single thing I have to say. Ever. Maybe I just want to lead a life that's independent from what they have in mind for me. See, spoiled brat talking. No reason to be sorry for myself, and yet I'm yakkity yakking away. Tough. I am so tired of this feeling. I am not sorry anymore."

"event","Ok, so I am here. woohooo!! No, I'm not really excited, coz as I said, i only joined coz I was bored. Actually i do a lot of randome things when I'm bored. Like last week i got bored, so I died my hair orange. My friend helped. Well, I donno, see, I was lookin for some Nero Wolfe fanfiction, and I came upon this website, and it helped. So, later I went back to investigate, and since I had nothing better to do with my self, I joined. So, now people, I'm not asking you to read this, but if you do...well, it's your personal risk, coz sometimes I tend to write (and be) crazy and at times even creepy things. Or, I may never be in the mood, one can never know. So, yeah, since I'm new, here is some junk about me: I'm 15, goin to high school. Life's ok. Am an only child and have no pets. I have four very good friends, but I can basically get along with anybody if I put my mind into it. Otherwise, I scare people off, coz they just don't amuse me. I say ""amusing"" almost to anything and it can mean anything between ""I think you are a piece of crap"" to ""I love, you marry me!!"". So, yeah. That is basically it. I might update again, then again why would you want me to? (is a rethorical quastion)"

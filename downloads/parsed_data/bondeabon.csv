please do, i'd really like to know what people think of me honestly.  one reason why i would want to read minds.  so i know how people really think.  but since i dont have this superpower...post me something."

but if you ask me for the password for huelessnitez, i might give it to you since that username is on my friends list.  i made the username huelessnitez cause i only have black and white dreams."

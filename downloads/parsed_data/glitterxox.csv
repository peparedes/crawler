If I was still in my manic depressive state I would be cutting myself today. 

My dad was like ""Just let her scream it makes her feel better"" @ dinner in one of his sarcastic jerk tones...

""Well dad yes, it does make me feel better, it's either screaming or I start cutting myself again...whatever you want though""

That shut him up. 

He needs anger managment and to see a therpist. 

SHIT THE WHOLE FUCKING FAMILY DOES. 

I am going insane...I should have stayed in the ""O.C.""

It has got to be better then this. 

I am done bitching.

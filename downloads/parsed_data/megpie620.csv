BlAcKROSES has signed off at 11:37 PM


Lisa was scared for her life, and curious as she was, she spun around immediately. Nothing was there. Her parents wouldnt be home from dinner for a couple hours, so she decided to get in bed and just try to forget about it. She grabbed the baseball bat next to her closet, and walked to her bed. She got in bed and turned off the lights.

she got scared,so decided to move to her parents big bed. The lights were off, but she could see the bed so she just climbed in and closed her eyes, taking deep breaths.

when she was finally relaxed, she felt some eerie breaths on the back of her neck. she froze completely.

""hey cutie pie"" a voice whispered.

that night, at 11:52 Lisa Sanchez was violently raped and murdered in her parents bed. the murderer was never located.

REPOST THIS IN 5 MINUTES WITH THE HEADLINE ""I WANNA MAKEOUT WITH..."" or expect an instant message from BlAcKROSES tonight at 11:37. Go ahead and google it if you wanna know more details"

"event","wow i love not having school and having a blast. this weekend was jampacked with lots of fun. on friday i didn't do too much just sat around. 

On saturday i went to the Michigan game with family and WE WON! our seats were cool row 20 from the field. i beleive they were the same seats we had for msu game. but it was cool. my stomach didn't feel so great in the beginning but then at the game i was fine. 

sunday. where do i begin. well i woke up at 7 then i went to go pick up maranda to go to cedar point then we came back and then left for the rd down there. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. i really wish that everyone could have gone but everyone was busy or gone so. ya. then we got there and the first ride we went on was the iron dragon. kinda crappy. then we went on the corkscrew. awesome ride. a lil scary at first but it was cool. it was my first upside down ride. then we went on a turn thingy ride. then lunch. then we went to a wildcat ride where your in this car and ya. then we went to the soak city area where we wanted to go on the big one that has like a 12 ft drop and you get soaked but i saw the ppl that got off and i didn't want to walk around all wet. then we went on a canoe type ride down a water slide and we sat in it with liek these indians that kept screaming. then it was doom time. THE GEMINI. we went on this with my brother and sister. and my sister like was holding up my arms and started to bend them a lil and it kidna hurt but i'm ok. then we went on something else and walked around. then we were going to go on raptor but time ran out so my sister my brother maranda and i decided to go on the mantis OMG! scared to death at first. some kid on a couple rides b4 us puked or either peed on the ride so they had to air it out by letting the ride go by itself 3 fricken times. i was a lil worried about me atthe time. he he. then it was our turn adn it was like 8 ish so it was dark and we had the front row. and the  mantis is the one where you stand up. WOW. so as soon as we started to go up the ramp. i was like this isn't so bad but WRONG dead WRONG. we turned that first corner and i was screaming. so loud. it was fun though. i am upset the picture didn't turn out. but i was a lil nervous. it was fun. so next time i go it's the raptor first one with whoever i go with and i have a feeling it's manda and kara AND maranda. i just know it. so that was like my weekend. and then today just maranda spent the night and that was like it. so ya. and ppl start to comment. oh ya i was supposed to go to arts beats and eats but didn't. well i'm outta here. ttyl."

TOGETHER! We need $15 to get all 3 of us on there. so then i knowing me had the BRILLIANT idea of counting all of our change and i mean litterally ALL OF IT! to the very last penny of mine. so the lady gave us our 15 tickets after dumping all of it on the counter and we were off. so as i was standign in line i was stuffing my face with cotton candy. yes pure sugar. so then when i got on i DID NOT FEEL GOOD AT ALL. and when we dropped manda and kara off the car ride home WAS A ROUGH ONE! oooooooo the memories. ok so thats the fair. so yesterday my sister and i decided to go 4 a bikeride after getting our brows done. so we did and had change leftover but i put it on the kitchen table liek my sister told me and ya. so we left without water. ok REALLY DUMB IDEA i almost fainted. so then we are riding and riding. then we were thisrsting so we stop at a gas station and walk in and get water. we go to pay for it and she's drinking it. ANNE WE ARE STANDING IN LINE. WHAT THE HELL R U DOING? so as you know i have a cold so i went to go get a napkin to blow my nose. ew i know SO gross. so then she said well can i have the money. i said...i don't have any money. Anne: well neither do i. MEGAN OMG! so here we are standing in the middle of the gas station with open water and i am laughing so incredibly hard you have no idea. my sister was liek ok we gotta get out of here. and of course i couldn't move cuz i was laughing so hard so to make a bigger scene. so we kinda just went over to the lil counter with the coffee and the slushies and left it there half full and walked out casually well she did i was laughing my ASS OFF litterally. so ya. then to top it all off i had to take my meds for after school b4 we left for the bike ride and then i had taken my morning dose instead. and i already took it in the morning so i was OVERDOSED! and i was dizzy, couldn't see straight, the heartbeat in my ears were going off and i did not feel good. so my mom came and picked me up.and my sister rode back. so thats how stupid the wiechec girls are. omg. so ya. this weekend is my sweet 16 bday party but my bday isn't til; the 20th boooooo. but i am having a lot of people come. you should too. ESPECIALLY REGGIE aka my boyfriend. yes. not the girl reggie. well you can too. but i haven't talked to reggie in like 4 wks. that horrible. and we didn't even break up. how bad is that? but it;s on sunday the party. gimme a hollar you wanna come. oh and i guess rachel is having a party tomorrow after school but i was invited so. w/e. well SCHOOLS OUT TOMORROW! last finals for freshham i mean FRESHMAN! i love you all.

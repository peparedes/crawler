This universe of ours is full of so many wonders that I know I will never even get a chance to contemplate, but I still find humans the most interesting creatures around me; I just don't understand us sometimes.  Who is winning in this battle of good versus evil?  Do we even know where the lines are drawn? I try so hard to keep a smile on my face, and a rosey tint on my perspectives, but sometimes the things happening across the world wear a hole in my heart.  

Yesterday a woman was raped in Washington as hundreds watched and no one helped.  I read that it's called the Bystander effect / Genovese Syndrome and it boggles my mind. The diffusion of responsibility is one thing, but how can you look at yourself in the mirror after standing by and watching something like that? I can't even watch it in movies like Memoirs of a Geisha. I suppose it's easy for me judge since I wasn't there, but it's still depressing.

People losing their lives over absolutely nothing.  Getting shot for ""being in the wrong place at the wrong time"" or a terrorist bomb, or a robbery gone violent.  Times can be hard, and we will always have differences of opinions, but where did the respect for life go? It's all we have...how can someone take it so easily? 

The world is broken in so many ways and in so many places.  I keep telling myself that I will do my part by healing people, or being a great father, but is that enough?  Am I taking advantage of the diffusion of responsibility?

Yosemite, Brazil, Vegas, a few Nor-cal trips, a few San Diego trips, UCI, becoming financially independant except for bank loans, going through hell and back and coming out in love with Ann-Mari, electing our first black president, and now my brother moving in.

I start school tomorrow and I'm pretty excited. Chemistry, Calc, Soc-psych, swimming, and capoeira and I'm looking forward to all of them.  Most of all, I'm finally at a big boy school, and that feels great.

Work WAS going great until I screwed up hugely twice in one day.  I'm pushing to be in the bar so I'm learning what's in all of our drinks, and I'm pro at our wine now (go ahead, ask me about any of our 30 wines) but coming in an hour late and forgetting to check out the shift before really hurt your chances at a promotion.  Just the week before they brought me in to the office and asked if I was interested in manager training.  I wasn't, but it was nice that they thought of me that highly.  So much for that...

On a happier not, I got to see the Baughs this past weekend for Sammy's Bday.  We frolicked around Disneyland for a while.  Man I love that family.  I need to pick them up and move them down here.  Wonder if they'd notice... Leah stayed a little later then the rest of the family and joined us on game night which is always a treat.  Team Pittsburg kicks ass!

"event","Wow yesterday was not the fun I wanted it to be.  That's the first time nature has punched me that hard. Kym had the bright idea of taking a different route up the mountain, so we set out for the middle of it instead of the side. We rode the horses until we passed a small little farm where an old man met us outside and actually offered to take us to the foot of the mountain.  He led us to a little watering hole where we tied up the horses.  He had a little dog that was adorable.  The dog actually stayed with us this entire trip, which you'll see is quite amazing, considering we scaled 15 foot boulders, and went through man eating vines.

Anyways, we left the horses and the old man behind us and started out long trek. It was exciting at first but then we took two steps and realized we had no idea where to go.  The trees didn't even break enough to see the mountain, except for every 50 yards for a quick second.  There was nothing even close to a train.  Even the trees gave way to large, overgrown weeds.  What we really needed was a machette. All of the plants had stickers, ranging from small ones just to stick a leaf on you, to cactus sized needles that sucks me through my jeans and stayed.  My brother and looked like cacti when we got home, among other things. So we get going and we have no idea how to choose our path as we go, we just try to look for the direction leading up the mountain while being somewhat accessible.  ""Somewhat accessible"" means there were only sticky plants to walk over or through, instead of places where branches  actually wove together to make a wall, or where it was straight cliff that we couldn't get up without gear.  Everywhere we went was like jungle vines wrapping around or bodies, neck, and worst of all feet, tripping us up.  The feet vines where especially scary while we were making jumps from one rock to the next.  twice Kym almost went head first into a 15 foot drop.  

It was a very slow climb.  Then, as we're both getting to the frustration point where it's just not a fun adventure anymore, kym gets stung.  We're not sure if it was a critter on a plant, or the plant itself that stung him, but he said it felt like a thousand needles of fire.  He screamed just a bit and yelled for water.  We poured some, which soothed him, and you could see his skin welting up where he got stung.  We brought 2 2-liter bottles of water with us, and used the last of the first one cleaning his arm.  Right there we decided it wasn't worth it any more.  We were about two thirds to the top, but we were halfway through our water, Kym was hurting pretty bad from his arm, and the climb was only getting harder.  So we turned around. The dog was still with us which was cute and comforting.  I had to help him sometimes when he actually climbed up some of the rocks we climbed that were near vertical, but had no way to get down.  I felt bad seeing him with stickies all over his fur, but he seemed used to it.  

The way down went faster, though not much faster.  Finally we found a dried up stream bed that we could follow.  More rocks, which really sucked when I rolled my ankle on my bad foot, but less plants.  Though this whole time we had to walk doubled over because of all the branches growing over it.  We found another problem though.  We had no idea how to find or get to the watering hole where the horses were.  I thought about that when we first left the horses, but was too excited about the adventure at the time, and figured I'd just remember land marks.  There was no way to remember anything in that jungle maze.  We get to the bottom of the mountain again and keep following the stream and hope that it leads to the watering hole, but soon find that it curves in the completely wrong direction.  we're lost, and we're down to 1 liter of water, and the sun is relentless.  We decide that if we can make it home, we can take the route that we know back to the horses, though it'll be much much longer since ""home"" was 10 kilometers away.  10 kilometers through weeds taller than me all with thorns and stickies and packed so tightly (just like the way up the mountain) that Kym and I have to walk with our forearms in front of our faces and our heads bowed in order to not have our faces scratched up.  Every inch of our body itched, and anything not covered was scratched and burning.  Not to mention that every half kilometer or so there was a barbed wire fence that needed jumping, which is really uncomfortable. This whole time Kym and I are being mostly silent, in horrible moods, doing our best to not blame the other just to have someone to blame, knowing that it wouldn't help us get home any faster.  

Finally, with about an hour of sun left, and 2 hours after the water was finished, we see our stables.  When we get home, we don't stop as people talk to us, we don't even answer, we just walk straight to the pool as we rip our clothes off and jump in.  Then showers and a lot of scrubbing, 500mg of ibuprofen each, and a lot of drinking water.  We hopped on the motorcycles with some stable hands (who were laughing at us) and went and grabbed the horses, as well as take the dog back, who still stayed with us the entire time.  He probably did the most for our morale during the trip.  

Now today I can barely move.  Everything hurts from climbing, lifting, crouching, and bending my way through this outback of ours.  

I took on a mountain in completely untouched wilderness, and lost horribly.  I learned a lot though, and next time I'll win."

Then afterwards there was cosmic bowling with Mariana, Josh, Kirsten, Janna, and Janna's friend.  I loved catching up with them and of course, it's never enough time. Mariana convinced me that I need to plan a big so-cal trek for everyone again during one of our many good conversations that day and night.  I would love to have everyone over to this house at least once more.  Maybe the first week of August... 

I came home Saturday for work Sunday morning, which was boring as all sunday morning shifts are.  That night though, I got a call from Danielle inviting me to hang with her and her friends/brother that came down for a day of Disney.  Very entertaining, and filled with pizza and alcohol.  I almost feel spoiled to get to hang out with Danielle again, having gone so long without.  Good times

"event","So I'm officially an Anteater! I finally decided, after visiting Irvine a few days ago.  I'll admit, during the drive there it felt like more of a chore than an exciting trip to a possible home for the next 2 years.  I forced myself to go before deciding which school to accept admission to.  But then I got there and it's HUGE and BEAUTIFUL!  There is a ginormous park the size of PHS in the centter of this donut shaped school.  They have a dorm area named Middle Earth, a very nice book store, a pool hall, an arcade, and a pub, all on campus! They have a study area open until 3 am, and the libraries are open 24 hrs a day during finals week.  I chopped it up with random students everywhere I went, and the student body seems more laid back than I expected.  I was completely surprised by just about everything that I saw.

So, despite UCSD making an amazing impression on me, UCI won me over in the end.  SD still remains my dream med school though.  One day at a time though..."

"event","Man, there are so many things to consider when choosing schools! IF SD and Irvine where people, I could peg personalities on them.  UCSD seems a bit more noble, and also a bit more arrogant. they absolutely blew my socks off during transfer day this last Saturday.  It helped that they had us enter through the medical school.  colors, information, and music everywhere.  The Geisel library was beautiful, AND they have a Jamba Juice on campas.  BUT they don't offer guaranteed housing to transfer students.  I could try the waiting list, which I think I'll do since I don't have any sort of credit to get an apartment.  Unless I can get Daniel to move down there with me, of course.  

Irvine I haven't checked out yet, and plan to as soon as my car is out of the shop.  Even without checking the campus though, Irvine seems much more inviting and accommodating.   They already sent me an email saying they'll give me $5000 a year that I wont have to pay back, and that I have until June 1st to apply for guaranteed transfer housing.  UCSD hasn't mentioned any grants and I doubt they will. It's all exciting though!

My parents came down this weekend and it was a good time.  We went to SD, my work, the swap meet, and the movies.  They almost went the whole time without dragging me into their little silliness too, so that was nice.  I'll tell ya, I'll be much less stressed when I have to rely on banks instead of parents for money.  Banks seem to handle money a little better than the Minick family.

My world feels like it's burning around me.  My financial situation is horrible. My parents keep using me as a medium for the routine breakup.

"event","So I went to Yosemite for spring break.  Bass Lake, more specifically.  Ann-Mari's parents let us use their cabin up there.  We went down to the valley almost every day to enjoy the beauty, despite the many attempts by mini vans to slow us down.  The first day we just got used to the altitude and did lower Yosemite falls.  The second day was the only big hike we could do, which was Vernal and Nevada falls.  We took the mist trail up Vernal falls, despite it being closed.  Once we got on it we realized why they had closed it.  We survived though, and at the top we sat on a big rock in the stream, had our lunch, and just laid back on eachother facing the sky for a quick cat nap.  After a little break we continued up to Nevada falls, but we only got half way up it before we hit our turnaround time, which is good since it looked like rain.  We decided to take the John Muir trail back, since it was the opened one, and it made the mist trail look like a walk in the park (no pun intended).  There were parts where the switch backs were completely covered in snow, so we couldn't take them. Instead we had to kick the melted and re-frozen snow into step.  We joked about it, but it actually was pretty hazardous.  We were hugging the mountain, and still nearly standing straight up.  We felt accomplished afterwards.  

That being our only big hike, since the others were closed still from snow, we spent the rest of the week on little day hikes, geocaching, or exploring the history of the national park.  One day I would like to hike all of the John Muir trail.  I would need to learn how to get my own food from the wild first, probably.  Would be quite the accomplishment though.  

So obviously Annie and I didn't stay broken up.  She texted me the morning after our break up with ""Please tell me last night didn't happen.""  We talked and tried to find the real source of the breakup.  We couldn't really, but we gave it another go anyways.  It was a little weird until halfway through the Yosemite trip.  We were both afraid to give anything our all because the relationship was so fragile.  But on the last night that we were there we were talking in bed and she rolls over, looks me dead in the eye, and says, ""I love you Alex. That scares me, but I do.""  It really caught me off guard. I honestly thought the signs I was reading were pointing towards us not making it after the trip, but then I put it together.  Here's a girl that is used to always having control, and always having guys fall in love with her way before she falls for them.  Now she feels the free fall of caring for someone rapidly, and she's not sure if I'm keeping pace.  I'd like to believe that that's where the doubts came from for the breakup.  It's a little romantic... So now we're good again.  We're not on edge, and we're not testing eachother.  We're just there for eachother.  It's nice =)

Oh yea. In other news, UCI accepted me for the fall.  The feelings of complete failure have lifted.  THAT's a pit I'm glad to be out of."

"event","Today (and when I say today, I mean Monday)  I woke up in Nor-cal to enjoy one last day with my pops.  We went to breakfast together, and then went to find the geocaches that elluded us the day before.  We found 3 out of the 4 that we missed, which is pretty great considering we didn't actually have a gps unit and were just using google earth from memory.  After that, he had to meet up with his friend Mike in Pleasant Hill, which worked out perfect since that's where I needed to be for a nice lunch with Danielle.  It was really great finally catching up with her, and boy did I miss a lot.  So we recapped over shakes and fries.  Then we said goodbye and I met up with my pops again for a movie. We went to watch Horton Hears a Who with Mike and Mike's daughter, Shelby.  It was a pretty good flick over all, though I almost missed my flight back down to So-Cal for it.  

I arrived back in So-Cal right on time and was picked up by Ann-Mari who was dressed to kill.  She really did look amazing tonight for our line dancing.  We even dragged Daniel and Bonnie along, though Sam didn't come with.  I learned to waltz and two step, 2 line dances, and even rode a mechanical bull.  It was pretty fun, but we cut out early since it was empty by 11ish.  I guess everyone went to another club, though a bus full of people arrived just as we exited. It was a great evening, and not only did I not feel like I was being hidden, I felt like I was being shown off. Very nice indeed.

So we get home and Ann-Mari and I take a little cat nap, but wake up around 1:30.  We then make love, but stop half way through.  I looked her in the eye and could tell something was wrong.  So I asked, and then came the answer of ""Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing. What we're doing.""  From there it was me slowly guiding her to realize that what she was feeling was really what she wasn't feeling.  

A little background info.  We hit it off really well.  We've been officialy for a little over 2 months, but it felt like longer.  We were completely comfortable with eachother.  We cracked all kinds of jokes, spent all day naked, even when we weren't doing anything, are taking a class together again, and are in constant contact through text, or phone, or IM, or whatever.  Our personalities, for the most part, just fit with eachother.  And, of course, we were attracted to eachother from the get go.  She's extremely beautiful, and very sexy.  Our kisses were passionate and long.  So when I realized what she was(n't) feeling, it was hard to let her know that that's what it was.  We just made sense together.  After that, through my breaking heart, I tried my hardest to convince her that I understood, and that it was ok.  I held back tears for as long as I could, but once she started balling, I couldn't hold back anymore.  We spent 2 hours laying naked together, crying and comforting eachother.  I know, beyond a doubt, that she really cares for me, and she know that I care for her.  We both know that we were an amazing couple, but we also both know, with the realization that she just doesn't have that internal burning fire and awe towards me, that it can't work.  That we could break up now, and it could be beautiful, or that we could break up later, and it could be ugly.  

It took us a long time to get out to her car, and we kissed goodbye long and hard.  I miss her terribly already, but I let my tears out when I walked back into my room.  It wont be easy being friends, but it'll be worth it, I think."

We went on all the big rides (Space Mountain was a lot of fun) and some of the little rides (Jungle adventure was my favorite.  ""The elephants might charge us. I don't know why they'd want to. There are banks on both sides of the river. Don't worry, they'll lose interest.""  I love that kind of humor) I'll put up pictures whenever I develop them since we both forgot our digitals and had to buy a disposable.  

There was Indiana Jones where we stared into the eyes of the idol 
Priates of the Carribean where we saw wenches for sale
Inventions where we saw ourselves age
Matterhorn (sp?) where we saw yeti
Thunder Railroad where we saw NO goat...
Space Mountain where we saw nothing but stars and had no idea which way we were turning
Haunted Mansion where we saw ghosts and a hidden Mickey
Story book land where we saw all the stories and another hidden Mickey
Buzz Lightyear where we destroyed the evil emperor Zerg ( I destroyed him more than her =P)
And a few other small ones like the tea-cups and Pinochio.

Then we walked through Downtown Disney and grabbed some dessert and a pretzel, came home and had a good long talk, watched half a movie, and fought the time for her to go.  The talk was good.  She explained about this last Monday and I have to say that Mia may be hurting things between Ann-Mari and I without knowing it.  I think Annie understands a bit more where I'm coming from though.  I guess we'll really see tonight and tomorrow since it's dancing night.

Cheap drinks, loud music, and by 4 am everyone was making out with eachother (except me, the only non-single guy there)  I left Daniel there since there is just a point where a guy who doens't dance much and isn't single will get bored of just talking to random people with loud music going.

Last night I had a long in coming talk with Shauna.  I think it went well, and I think it was a big step for me.  I also got to see Jared, Tony, and Melody again, which was awesome.  I just don't get up here as much as I used to since getting my job.  Everytime I leave it hurts too.  Well I'll enjoy it for one more night before going back down south.

I've noticed a routine with Ann-Mari.  We talk at least once a day and hang out on weekends a bunch.  Thursday is a good day for us.  But then Monday rolls around and she goes line dancing.  She's a flirt and likes attention.  She went just about 2 years without having a boy friend and is really used to being single.  So every Tuesday it seems like things are weird between us because I think she is still getting used to having a boy friend while going out dancing, even though I'm not there.  She also is getting angry because apprently her friend that she takes dancing keeps bringing up the fact that she has a boy friend to the people she's around.  Is it normal to find this upsetting?  To me, this says that she's hiding me.  Perhaps that's my insecurities talking and she's really just getting used to not being single and doesn't appreciate her friend force feeding it to her.  She's told all her friends about me, but it feels like she's hiding me still.  Maybe I'm just afraid of another Courtney, but I don't think I'm the kind of boyfriend you hide.  Frustrating...but only on that day.  The rest of the time is generally great.  She gets me random surprises, texts me goodnight almost everynight, and when we hang out we have a lot of fun.  I wish I knew for sure...

Oh well, tonight is all about seeing as many friends up here as I can in the short time I'm here.  Just a handful right now, but the more the merrier!"

"event","what an amazing weekend!  The only thing that was supposed to happen that didn't was getting to see Derrick, which I understand and will make up for when I go up north next week.  I went up to Idyllwild on Saturday after lunch with Ann-Mari to visit my dad and grandma.  I love spending time with both of them and it was such a beautiful place.  We spent most of the time just in front of the fire talking about everything in life.  I also got the dime tour of the small town.  I told my grandma that I'd visit more often, and I mean to.  She's just such a positive woman, and so darn smart.  It was interesting having all three of us in the same room because she's very metaphysical, my father is very religious, and I'm very scientific.  But we all respect eachother, so it works.  

Something else amazing happened today.  I got a call a little over an hour before I had to leave Idyllwild from Josh.  He was headed down south to do a job and wanted to get together at some point while he was here.  He said he had to make a stop at Norco to pick up some keys, then head down to damn near Mexico.  We talked for a bit then I said I'd call him back.  I enjoyed the last hour with my dad and grandma, then hit the road.  I realized that I would pass Norco on my way home so I gave Josh a call back and we set up food time.  It actually worked out so well, time wise, that I saw his truck pass me as I was getting off the offramp.  We went to applebee's and just talked like we always do for never enough time.  I remember when we used to hang out every day.  Hardly seeing eachother at all now is a big change, so we always leave feeling like there wasn't enough time.  He's working about 4 hours away from Huntington Beach, but we set up a meeting for Wednesday at San Diego since it's about the halfway point.  It's tentative, but I have high hopes.  

When I finally got home, Ann-Mari was right behind me bringing a new puppy to our house.  Samantha and I decided to foster a puppy for the Irvine Animal Care Center.  So for the next 2 weeks we have an adorable furry little poop factory.  I've dubbed him Bandit and he's a lab, rot mix and the cutest little thing ever.  He's only been here for 4 hours and has managed to pee on the floor 3 times, and poop once, plus once each outside after eating.  It's my own fault since I know that if they whine in their kennel during sleep time, it's not just because they want to play. It's because dogs don't defecate where they sleep if they can help it.  I'll learn though, and in the meantime I'm keeping one more puppy out of the shelter and getting house broken, which mean more of a chance of a succesful adoption eventually.  Mustn't get too attatched...

In other news, I picked up a tutoring job.  8 hours a week with grades 8 and below.  I have 4 students for now, and that's all I can handle I think with my other job and school.  I start this week, so we'll see how it goes.  

so much good stuff this weekend!"

"event","Ugh, Heather and I got into it the other day.  I'm done with it.  I tried being nice for 2 months, but all it does is make her think we'll get back together I guess.  I finally actually got angry at her. Still am, a little bit.  Hopefully now she can just move on, preferably without talking about me behind my back to all my friends I introduced her to.  

School's out and I'm happy about it.  A little break will be nice.  Well, a kind of break since I still have work, but still a break.  For example, I have all day today to do nothing, and it is glorious.  I'm getting the hang of serving, I think.  Alecia and Morgan may be the only ones to understand my pain at the following, but I was working the patio a few day ago, and no one wanted to sit outside since it was a little chilly.  Well the lunch rush hit and the bar and dining area filled up pretty fast.  Now all of the sudden people are willing to sit outside rather than wait for a table inside.  I had 7 tables sit down back to back to back.   7 TABLES!!  By the time I'm asking what the 3rd would like to drink, the 1st is already getting antsy about not having their drinks yet.  I know the hosts couldn't help it, but it wasn't fun.  Made 50 bucks in an hour though, which is more than I expected from the less-than-par service I had to give and the tons of ""we're just getting soup"" tables.  I haven't had any big nights yet, and the most I've walked with after tip out is $110.  I'll get there though.

I started dating again.  I'm not sure if I like it.  Makes me feel all awkward, and I hate wondering what the girl really thinks of me.  Strange to go from a relationship where you knew the girl loved you, to dating where you can't tell if you're a fling, or a potential boy friend.  What's worse is that I actually care.  Why would I make myself vulnerable so soon. Though, she is very smart, and pretty, and fun.  She calls or texts everyday, and invites me into her world to meet her friends.  She's just very confident and sure of herself, and perhaps that's intimidating to me.  Enough to make me feel awkward anyways.  Bah

My parents are coming for Xmas, I think.  My mom is suppose to arrive tomorrow night, and my dad the following day.  They're pretty flaky, but I still have hopes. Plus, my mom actually bought a plane ticket this time. I can't wait to see them again.  I missed Thanksgiving with them.  Here's to a merry Christmas!"

The cruise was fun.  It was a weird mix of high class and ghetto which was easy to get used to.  Heather and I did rock climbing, saw La Bufadora, tried escargo, and even gambled away my frist 20 bucks.  I actually got a small picture of why my mom is addicted to gambling.  When I play a game, be it sport, board, video, or whatever, I hate to lose.  If I lose, I want to go back and keep playing until I get better and win.  That just doesn't happen in casino games.  Luckily I went in with the mindset that I was spending 20 bucks at the arcade, not hoping to win money from a casino.  Things between Heather and I didn't seem awckward at all, which was very nice.  They seem to be now...but they wern't then.  

I also went to the San Diego Zoo on Friday.  It was cool, but kind of miserable. It was cold and raining all day and I ended up soaked, which wasn't fun.  I did get to see the jaguars and gorillas though, so that was nice.  The main high light was getting to see Nick on the way back.  He's back from Iraq and just finishing up some stuff and Pendleton, then he's out of the marines for good.  We caught up on eachother's families, made old jokes, and stuffed our faces.  It was familiar and nice, and hopefully will happen a few more times before he leaves for Nor-Cal.  

Christmas time is here.  I look forward to all the holiday cheer.  Samantha keeps filling the house with decorations, and Daniel and I are suppose to go get a tree today. I wonder how much they cost.  It'll be the first Christmas tree I've ever bought.  I was going to get a plastic one since I thought that might be better for the environment, but plastic will stay in my home for a while, then in a landfill for a long long while, right?  The tree will come from a farm where they plant 3 trees for every 1 tree they take, and afterwards I can recycle the tree into something else.  Plus, I want the smell.  

I miss Nor-cal in the holidays.  I may have to steal a trip up there."

My life went from incredibly full last week to seemingly empty this week.  I'm sure the fact that I don't have midterms or 5 days of training this week is a part of it, but still.  I'm just as guilty as her for not really having a social life outside of our relationship, not that I feel like being social at all right now.  Mariana helped a lot, and so did Daniel.  I just don't like going coldturkey I guess.  Going from getting to see her everyday to not even talking to her.  But I can't make her talk to me, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to see me yet, so I have to deal.  Use this time to figure out somethings about myself.

Some poor farm animal?  It looks like things are in the upswing now.  I know that fires need to happen for the ecosystem in this area, and I know we as humans pride ourselves on adjusting nature to our needs, but sometimes it just doesn't work out that way.  I do like when people with power try to do things to really help though. The little things like:

""Supervisor Ron Roberts, chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, announced triumphantly that someone had requested the first permit to rebuild a burned-down house.

""This is great news,"" he said. ""We haven't issued the permit yet, but we're going to do it as quickly as possible.""

The supervisors have voted to lift the fees for rebuilding permits and to expedite what is often a slow, complex process.""

The relief centers in San Diego offered tons of information on how to rebuild, what to watch out for, what needs to be done now and what needs to wait, etc. I suppose I can't imagine exactly what it's like to lose my home, but I'm sure that it become just a little easier if the people around you guide you towards a path that ends in light, even a distant one.  

My life is slowing down a bit now thankfully.  2 midterms done and 3 days of training for the new job done.  Now I can focus on memorizing all the bar stuff I need to know instead of the pen of a squid or crop of an earthworm.  All interesting, just not what I need to know right now.  Heather is getting promoted to the original position she applied for, so she's pretty excited about that.  Her place is coming along nicely and we've got our cruise coming up.

He and another manager sat me down, asked if everything was alright, got me good and nervous, then promoted me.  I start server training on Tuesday.  I'm so excited about finally making real money.  Plus, I need something to take up all the extra time dropping chem has left for me, and servers give up shifts much more easily than expos do.  

Friday I moved Heather into her new place which is a cute little Jr. bedroom in a nice gated apartment complex.  It's closer to both her jobs and such a big step for her.  I'm excited about it.  After moving her in we hit the road (her, Daniel and I) for Nor-Cal and got in around 10 where my parents surprised me with coxinhas (my favorite food) and a 24 pack of Guarana (my favorite soda from Brazil) along with a cake and a song.  I love going home and seeing them.  I'll miss them when they're not in this country anymore so much.  But I'd rather them be gone and happy then accessible and getting by.  They deserve their retirement.

Saturday we all slept in and then went to breakfast with my pops at a waffle house before raiding Barnes and Nobles.  When we got back I decided that I wanted to drive in the Z3 so I grabbed Daniel and took it for a spin while Heather showered.  She wasn't feeling so hot so I thought I'd buy her a gift in puppy form.  Obviously her new place wouldn't allow a real one so I got her the dalmation version of Nintendogs for the DS since her last dog was a dalmation and she misses her tons.  It's cute to see her play with her new pet.  I wish I could get her the real thing.  Some day perhaps.

Anyways, that night was the real party.  A bunch of peeps flaked but we still rolled 20 deep on the party bus to a club pretty much to ourselves in SF.  There was so much drinking and dancing and amazing people that I don't get to see nearly enough.  Kirsten and I made sure to party like it was our birthdays and we paid for it in full, but so worth it.  Her, Heather, Daniel, Mariana, Andre, Gustavo, and J had breakfast at their house this morning before us So-Cal peeps headed back home.  I don't know how they pack so much awesome into my life but I'm not complaining.

A quote from my math teacher towards the class today. He was referring to the lecture of course, but I couldn't help but picture a political leader of some sort saying the same words.

Anyways, school has started again, and I'm thankful for it.  I thought I was going to die of boredom last week.  

Backpacking was awesome though!  We went to Emmigrant Wilderness, in Stanislaus.  Only a 2 night trip, but it was a blast.  Sleeping in a different spot each night.  Not having another 40 families ""roughing it"" in their RVs.  Eating lunch by a random pond we dubbed ""lily pond"" while playing The Great Dalmuti.  And just being in nature, breathing non-LA air.  We hiked close to 10 miles a day, with most of it going up or down hill.  Mariana almost died, but she has great memories now, and knows that she prefers camping to backpacking.  It was me, Mariana, Vanessa, Rob, Greg, and Christine, all with our packs (me with the oldest set of gear by far) hiking from crabtree to Gem Lake.  I want to go again, to a different place, over a longer period of time.  I suppose food would be more of an issue, but if I changed a few things about how I packed, I'm sure I could fit food for a week.  I think my favorite part though, was 3/4 of the way back on the last day, stopping at the last lake on the trail, throwing down our packs, and diving into the water for one last swim.  Rob, Christine, and I even found some good rocks to boulder-jump from.  Such good times. 

Now it's back to the normal grind.  Zoology, Chemistry, and Pre-Calc.  Math is a snooze, Chemistry is starting slow (though I know it'll pick up steam), and Zoology has an awesome teach, but a huge workload it seems for a 4 unit class.  I guess that's the line up forever though. 2 sciences and a math from now until the end of time. Exciting!

It'll be nice to finally read how that all ends.  One of my lab partners apparently already read the last chapter on the internet and was talking to our 3rd lab partner about it in hushed tones.  I had to threaten them with a bunsen burner to shhh it up until at least Monday.  I don't think it's the actual last chapter, but still.

After Harry Potter is BlizzCon on the 3rd and 4th of August.  Yes, I will soon be able to cross ""go to at least one geek convention"" off of my life to-do list.  I will submerge myself in all that is MMORPG as interpreted by Blizzard, and I shall be a better gamer, but worser person for it. I can't wait!

But there's still more!  Just one week after that, I'm headed up north for my first ever backpacking experience.  Emigrant Wilderness by Yosemite is the name of the place, and I'll be roughin' it for 3 days there.  I'm a little nervous, but mostly excited.  It will be at least Vanessa and I, and I think Mariana and Christine, but I'm not sure who else.  Hope I don't get eated...

Mainly because the biggest thing to look forward to is my CRUISE!  It's just a small one, but it still counts.  4 days from here to encinata and back.  Heather and I are treating ourselves to sun and fun on a big boat where I'm told I can eat as much as I want!  It's pretty damn exciting.  We opted for the one where you spend the most amount of time out at sea.  Something about the ocean just attracts me...

So fun times are lined up for this brazilian.  Just have to keep my responsibilities in order.  Work is going well, though I'd really like to be server and make the money I need.  School is school.  I'll be taking Chemisty, organic chemisty, botany, and pre-calc (yea, behind in math) this coming semester.  I may or may not have to give up sleep in order to keep the GF, work, and video game time in there.  

Well time to get them Z's while I still can.

P.S.  There was a ginormous plane crash in Sao Paolo, Brazil, where I think everyone died.  The scary thing is, that was my mom's scheduled flight but she decided last minute (as she often does) to stay another week or two.  Scary. I can't quite put a name on what I felt when I heard that was her flight.  Some wierd form of relief I suppose, even though I found out afterwards and never even suspected that she was on that plane."

Work is going well. I've upgraded to To-Go worker, which is like server training, so I'm right on schedule to maker server by fall semester.  Eventually I want to be bartender though.  That's the only way I can see myself making enough money to support myself while still having enough time for school.

Things with Heather and I are awesome.  It's really about compromise.  The more you like someone, the more you're willing to compromise.  I've also realized that I'm a bit too much like my mother in relationships.  Too often I want it my way.  I blame it on my arrogance, but I'm working on it.

I've got 2 new roommates now as well.  Daniel is in the middle room, and Samantha is in the smaller room.  Daniel is trying to crack his way into Hollywood as a screen writer.  He walks anywhere within a 5 mile radius rather than taking his car, and he seems to be a semi-gamer.   Samantha is working on her masters in psychology and is actually paying 2 rents for the next month; one here, and one in L.A. where she has her internship until July 18th.  She's the oldest at 25, and works with her ""crazies"" here in HB.  I've got high hopes,as always, and I think I'll be able to carry what I've learned from the last roommate experience over to this one to make it even better.  That's the secret to success, right?

Summer school has started.  Just 5 units since 10 units is apparently over the limit and I never got around to talking to the dean.  2 hours of lecture in a hot room with no air-conditioning, then 3 hours of lab in a make-shift laboratory since the real one is under construction.  Should be a hoot!

I guess I better go get ready for the hoot."

"event","This is driving me insane. It seems that everything I do, if it's not an action that allows me to spend time with Heather, it's a wrong action.  If I have to work later than expected, or have to go in for an extra day for training for my promotion I just got, or just want some alone time at night.  She wants to spend all the time possible together.  I understand that we both work, and have limited time available to spend together. And it's sweet that she wants to see me as much as possible.  The problem is the way I feel when I dissapoint her.  It hurts her, and everytime I hurt her I get this wave of guilt.  I shouldn't feel like shit for having to work an extra shift.  I shouldn't feel like shit for an unexpectedly busy night where I have to work for more than 7 hours with no break.  I shouldn't feel like shit if a couple nights a week I want to just zone on my own with my longest hobby, so long as I still plan a few nights for us to hang out too.  It's madenning.  I feel as though the only way to satisfy her is to be availiable for her at all times that she's available.  

We go out to dinner and watch Pirates of the Carribean 3 on Monday, I bring home dinner and a movie Tuesday night after work, and I say that Wednesday I'll be playing by myself. Now I feel like shit for it.  I shouldn't feel like shit...should I?

"event","so much time has passed since I last wrote in here. You know what that means: long post.

First off, life is grand.  Aside from chemistry, which I need to step it up in, life is doing pretty well.  Plans for selling the place are right on track ( as far as I know considering it's my mom's investment and project) and it'll be nice to have less bills in my name.  I think, from now on, I'd like no bills in my name unless I'm paying for them.  Not sure how the living situation will be working itself out once this place is gone.  James will hopefully want to stay around here and we can grab a 2 bedroom apartment for $1200 or less.  I can afford $600 a month on rent.  How you say?

with my new job! That's right folks, I've rejoined the land of the steadily employed.  Not only that, I can now cross ""working at a restaurant"" off my life-long ""to-do"" list.  I'm an official food runner in training for the Lazy Dog Cafe, which is a local food chain.  They're opening their 3rd resaurant down the street from Disneyland and Angel stadium, and I just happened to see their ""now hiring"" ad in craigslist.  At first I just figured it would be just another eatery, but after a couple days of training I'm totally brainwashed.  It seems like a really great place to work.  at least 20 hours a week with tips.  I hope to make bartender eventually, but I'm content with food runner for now.  I still need to know everything about the menu, so going from this to server shouldn't be too hard at all.  I just need to make sure it doesn't interfere with school.  

Must keep school priority. Must keep school priority.  I've invested too much into it to screw up now.  I'm getting into my dream school if it's the last thing I do.  There are better schools out there for my major, but I'm stubborn.  I want UCSC.  I've always wanted UCSC.  I will have UCSC.

But that's a little ways off now.  At least until January, at most (hopefully) September 2008.  I got nothing but time.  Plus, I like that I get to spend more time in so-cal, with my new job, and Heather.

...

There's something no one saw coming, eh?  I'm in a relationship I can see myself staying in for longer than a few months.  We always have a blast together. doing anything, or nothing.  This last weekend we went to San Diego and explored Sea World for the first time in my life.  I not only got to watch my favorite animal perform spectacularly, but I got to feed and pet it too!  I was so happy and took so many pictures. I'll post them later.  It was her idea, but I can't believe it's taken me this long to experience that place.  We got the season pass since it was the same price, so we'll be going back at least once this summer. Open invitation peeps.  

We laugh at our geekiness.
We go hiking in woods
We go rock climbing.
We go to theme parks.
We play video games together.
We lay next to eachother all day. Reading, watching movies, and playing under the sheets.
We share literature with eachother.
We bring eachother out of our shells with a warm hands. 

I'll never know how I luck out as much as I do, but I'm not complaining.  I'm even taking her to meet the family tomorrow.  Not the parents who have already met her, and love her (yes even my mom! scary...) but Ana and Brian.  They promised to behave.  I'm excited about this, and as much as I'd like to say I'm so goal oriented that I can't wait to get out of here to UCSC, I'm also thankful that I get more time here with her to see just how beautiful she is, and how beautiful we are together.

"event","Bleh.  I knew it was coming.  I know why it came.  But I still am sad at it being official.  UCSC declined me.  I haven't gotten the official notice in the mail saying why, but I did reread the requirements.  I needed to take all the math courses needed by spring.  Summer courses just wont cut it unless it's just to fill in the amount of units needed.  I somehow let myself build up hope though.  Why did I do that? It's in black and white on the transfer requirements.  I allowed myself hope, and now I'm allowing myself sadness for a bit...

But what I wont allow is for this to stop me.  I wont even allow this to set me back.  If anything, I will use this as an opportunity to accomplish more in the given time.  I will take the required math in summer, along with an additional class, maybe 2.  Chemistry at the least.  Then I will take another biology, chemistry (organic), math, and maybe spanish 2 during the fall.  And then, if they don't take me for winter semester, I'll take winter courses at GWC.  Math and spanish most likely.  Then come spring I'll take another biology, chemistry (organic), math, and spanish 3. 

I'm getting into that school.  That's final.  I've lost this battle, but I'll win the war."

"event","Went up north this weekend and had a blast as usual.  It was only possbile becuase of Heather, she gets 8 thumbs up.  I finally got to check out Mariana's and Kirsten's apartment, which was very nice. had about 15 people in and out of that place.  Got to jam with Brian, like only he and I can do. Got to meet my brother's roommates and invited them to tag along too.  Awesome folks for the record.  Got to see Jared and Sammy, even if it was just for a bit.  And most importantly I got to introduce everyone to Heather.  I love introducing awesome people to awesome people.  

The next day we rocked it out at rock city in Mt. Diablo.  Heather, my brother, Ceylia, Mariana, and myself spent hours and hours just climbing every rock we could find.  Of course Kym and I had to do everything just a little harder, but that's the fun of it, right?  The girls did pretty awesome too.  Even got to take a picture with Heather on the scariest rock of all.  I wont lie, my knees were shaking a bit.  Also threw the movie 300 in at the end of the day. ::: okay...lets make cool movie! yea yea...ok what's cool? how about Halo? Halo is cool!  wait, they're already making a Halo movie...well... isn't master chief called a spartan? Lets run with that. OK, what was the coolest thing the spartans did? That one time where it was like 300 of them v.s. a million, right? lets roll with it.  okay okay...there needs to be lots of blood, because that's what makes a cool movie. Oh yea! and BOOBS. gotta have lots of boobs for it to be a cool movie.  Now, how do we make this different from every other blood and boobs movie out there? I know! lets film it...in sepia! Yea, that would be totally awesome! :::  I'm pretty sure that was the mind set of the creators.  Actually, I really enjoyed the movie. A little dramatic, but pretty damn awesome and definetly worth seeing on the big screen.  

Saturday and Sunday were spent recovering at Heather's house.  I was so sore after rock city I didn't want to move.  But the great thing about Heather is that we can have just as much fun as we do rock climbing together, simply laying in bed together all day, pretending to watch movies and eating fruit snacks.  Sunday was a bit sadder because the goodbye was coming, and it didn't help that San Jose mocked us for 3 hours, but it was still sweet.  Plus, I'm going up there for spring break this year.  

I can't wait for Mariana's/James' birthday party.  Not to mention having an entire week with the friends that I can never see enough of.  I just wish I could spend some of it with my brother.  Oh well, I hope he finds what he's looking for in Brazil."

Is dressing nicely false advertising for me?  I like to know I look good.  Helps with my confidence to a degree, and thus makes me less shy.  But I can't help but notice that when people meet me now they expect something totally different than who I am.  

I'm a geek, through and through.  I watch anime, read comics, play video games, and think of ways in which concepts in sci-fi movies can be realized.  I know what an epic flying mount is, what 1337 is, what a shinigami is, when winter-een-mas is, and can understand forum chat perfectly.  

so when people meet me in some aeropostale jeans and a shirt or whatever, they're completely blown away later when they learn of my profound geekiness.  Not to mention the nerdiness.

At first, when I didn't have much experience or perspective, I wanted to create a movie based on my life (lame, I know) and see if people would watch it.  Eventually though it changed into a desire to write. I blame the blogs and the amount of reading I've done in the last half decade.  Now I keep thinking of characters and ideas that I'd like to express through a long and complex story.  I'll never do it of course. I'm too critical with my own writing, and too lazy to take the amount of time it would take to create something I approve of.  That and perhaps I'm afraid of actually giving something my all and have it be crap.  Plus, anytime I try to put these thoughts on any sort of medium, it never comes out as nicely as it is in my head.

I drove up with Heather to drop her off at her new job and life this weekend.  It was a wonderful time, half spent at my parents, half spent at her new place.  It's in the middle of a beautiful wood,  30 minutes away from anything.  Her coworkers are awesome.  They're complete campers that come from all over the place with awesome stories to tell.  They're told me there could be a job for me if I wanted it this summer. I could work with either the kids or the horses.  Both sound fun, but I don't think it'll happen. The reason I'm not going to Brazil is because I have a feeling I'll need to take a summer course.  Oh well. Also, my mom actually got along with Heather.  She had the desire to sit and talk with her, and even joked around with her.  The only other person I remember my mom doing that with was Danielle S.  Even Mariana was surprised.  

But now she's gone.  

She's gone and I'm not allowed to be sad because this is a wondeful new life she's beginning, with oceans of adventure and opportunity.  I'm very happy for her, and very proud.  It takes a lot of bravery to up and move away from everyone and everything.  Not for school, but to actually step into your career.  Admiration is the word.

Biology      = Absolutely love the teach. She knows her stuff, teaches it with passions, and takes time for the student's interest as well
Math         = Really...REALLY easy.  Cool teacher so far. Very lenient with no homework, nor attendance grades.
Acting       = I'm really bummed, but I didn't get in.  Amen wouldn't take anymore students than the computers originally allowed.

"event","An except from ""Veronika Decides to Die"" by one of my favorite authors, Paulo Coelho.  It's a little sad, but it reminded me of when I fathomed that I was ""Independant.""  It takes place in the mental hospital she is in as a result of her attempted suicide.  After a few days and events, she contemplates in the freedom of a place where you're not only allowed, but expected to throw off the shackles of social etiquette.


     As she was walking down the corridors, lit by the same faint light as in the ward, Veronika realized that i 'was' too late: She could no longer control her fear.
     'I must get a grip on myself. I'm the kind of person who sticks to any decision she makes, who always sees things through.'
     It's true that in her life she had seen many things through to their ultimate consequences, but only unimportant things, like prolonging a quarrel that could easily have been resolved with an apology, or not phoning a man she was in love with simply because she though the relationship would lead nowhere. She was intransigent about the easy things, as if trying to prove to herself how strong and indifferent she was, when in fact she was just a fragile woman who had never been an outstanding student, never excelled at school sports, and had never succeeded in keeping the peace at home.
     She had overcome her minor defects only to be defeated by matters of the fundamental importance. She had managed to appear utterly independent when she was, in fact, desperately in need of company. When she entered a room everyone would turn to look at her, but she almost always ended the night alone, in the convent, watching a TV that she hadn't even bothered to have propertly tunred. She gave all her friends the impression that she was a woman to be envied, and she expended most of her energy in trying to behave in accordance with the image she had created of herself.
     Because of that she had never had enough energy to be herself, a person who, like everyone else in the world, needed other people in order to be happy. But other people were so difficult.  They reacted in unpredictable ways, they surrounded themselves with defensive walls, they behaved just as she did, pretending they didn't care about anything. When someone more open to life appeared, they either rejected them outright or made them suffer, consigning them to being inferior, ingenuous. 
     She might have impressed a lot of people with her strength and determination, but where had it left her? In the void. Utterly along. In Villete. In the anteroom of death.



Ok, so the suicide part doesn't relate at all, but many of the other things I know I've been guilty of.  I would do well never forget that, so that I never repeat it.  It was horrible...



P.S.  First day of school.  Chem for 5 hours with a teacher that talks more about home life and football than Chemistry, and Bio for 5 hours with a down to earth, fun Bio teacher that knows her stuff it seems.  Just first impressions."

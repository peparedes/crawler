"event","sitting in this basement
alone in the barkness to do nothing but think
think of your smile and your eyes that i could stare in for days
wondering where you have been
thinking that maybe its to good to be true
Im never this lucky
Im falling to fast
it cant be reality
Im never this lucky





so fucking confused....so many fucking emotions running through me

happiness - of royal blood liked the picture i edited for them and they made it there main pic on there myspace....and they want me to make more :D

confused - was asked by a good friend to move in with him....it will never happen but it was just weird

sadness - where have you been for the past 2 days?

like i said....im never this lucky"

The who point of me taking this class was to get my portfolio, not to get a certificate that no ones gunna care about exept for my parents, cause i sure as hell dont care about it. I have a headache ugh. So theres this boy and im falling head over heels for him....he gives me butterflies in my stomach everytime i see him and i just wish i could kiss him forever. Hes so cute he holds me like hes holding on for dear life, it makes me feel so safe....i feel like a little gidy girl, and i dont ever get like this....but i kind of like it...but only because of the reason :P I actually think i have some issues...ahhh giddy girl..i cant even talk about it without blushing and having this stupid little smile on my face hahhahaha im such a loser....oh well im happy and thats all that matters :D:D:D:D"

"event","have you ever just loved the idea of a person but when your with them its differnt...you pick out the faults and dont let yoursefl see the good things because you know youll fall for them...you cant fall in love with the idea because you have to have all of it, the person and the personality. Scared to know you can love again...afraid of the heartache i once felt. He was the one that once ruined a friendship....and yet, hes the one i want...but i cant because of the drama that will come with it...i can just see the tears that i will shed if it happenes. 

I want to open myself up to the vulnerability...but i dont know if i can do that....my mind is saying no but my heart is saying DO IT NOW.......im so confused. I just wish i could vanish from here to the land of no drama lol....no devil girl...no school...just money and my man :P

"event","life is so blank, yet everyone is sitting on my shoulders, i hate high school but knowing that i will be ending soon scares me and it make me not wnat to leave. Im not ready to go to college im only 16 well ill be 17 in 29 days but fuck ill be 17 going to college and everyone is gunna be out partying and i still have 2 years to go before i could even step into a bar. My parents are pushing me so much and they dont even relize it. I feel like everything will change after this year. I feel like i wont have any friends cause i might be to busy with school and they will just stop caring about me. i dont want to leave my safe place when i can be young and no one cares cause its high school...you can immature there it dosent matter but COLLEGE ahhhh that is fucking freaky. i dont want to leave all my friends and i dont want to grow up. i miss the times of just being happy that i passed my class , now all i hear is "" you have to do your best so u can get into good classes and BLAH BLAH BLAH"" i cant take this im not ready and no one understands that. Fuck i had a mental breakdown in math class all because i didnt understand some fucking project. i dont understand it cause everything is just a fucking blank just because i want to do well but its to much stress and it just goes black...i wasent ment to leave high school yet im just not ready and no one understand that exept for me.

Another thing is that i fucking miss marissa and i miss it when me and her were close not jess and marissa and i know that sounds horrible of me but god my friends are so freeking clueless of what is going on with my life that i just dont even bring it up cause they dont understand...nor do they care. I miss it when i had shawna and she just undertood me so well and it didnt matter if i had other friends just because they werent like her, they didnt understand like her. No one will ever understand like her. everytime we try to be friends again it just dosent work because she dosent call so i jsut give up on calling her. why cant it just go back to the summer and i would of never gone out with james and shit would be just so much different...things would be the same and i wouldent be hurting liek this. sometimes i just look at my closet and picture hwats inside there...that glass that hides from me but then i stop myself because a long time ago i promise myself and someone very special to me that i woudl never do that again i never will. because no matter what, even if im not friends with that person anymore, i still care about them more than anyone and i would still do anything for them and ill stick to that for the rest of my life.

Sometimes i wish life would just stay still.

so yea, sorry i haven't talked to much since i came back to cornwall.... i feel really bad about it, i miss you alot. that's why i came home early tonight. so yea.... when i did those clonaz it made me realize something.... that i tend to neglect what's important for the sake of getting fucked up..... but now i'm making a definete change. i'm not going to go around and do stupid shit like that again. i realize how much i hurt you by doing stupid shit like that.... and i really can't take it anymore.... i really don't like seeing you being hurt, sad, or worried. alex is with me on this one and we've decided to definetly try and phase out all hard drugs out of our lives. i'm tired of being the reason you sit up and worry at nite. i care for you way too much to allow this to happen to you. i'm not promising instant results..... but it is going to get better, i promise you baby. i don't care if you don't want to not change because of that's who i am.... but it hurts me way too much to see you like that and all i want to do is make you happy..... anyways your online so i'll talk to about it online.you rox my soxs babyxoxoxoxo

James

He's actually trying and im so proud of him...i never thought he would actually try to quit... i was actually kind of giving up hope on him...but this...THIS...changes it all. it makes me apreciate him so much more.

We faught so much while he was down here for a week, but it was always about drugs so maybe it will change now if hes quitting, i understand he might fuck up but thats ok i told him i would be there no matter what even if he does fuck  up...I Love Him...to bad i cant tell him...*sad face* he dosent love me...i just rox his sox...i might scare him away if i say i love him and i dont want to do that...i know i do because ive never given someone my body and soul like i have given it to him...i just wish he felt the same way.

No real emotion just pain...and more pain. No one cares and i don't care. Is this what life has become. what is a smile...something that cracks my face with the slightest smirk. Love isnt what its suppose to be...the definition of love in the dictionary is; a powerful emotion felt for another person manifesting itself itself in deep affection, devotion or sexual desire. Its not at all what love is anymore...Love=pain...theres no more happy ever afters...if its happy its not over yet. All i hear from people now is Oh i love so and so...BUT...we fight all the time...he hits me...he verbally abuses me...IS THAT LOVE...NO. thats bullshit love is bullshit...people don't even understand love anymore...its merely a word to them now...before ""I love you"" was something u said when u truly felt the emotion...its nothing now, people have over used the word love and it no longer has any emotion or significants...ITS NOTHING...just like life...NOTHING"

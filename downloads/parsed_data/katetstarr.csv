"event","SB is over, going back to classes is going to be a bitch. Finals are coming up in May, and Ill prolly start studyin in April. Boo. SB was amazing! Dave and I went to Canada (toronto) with Erik and Lindsay...really fun, really expensive. Those Canadians have a 14% tax. what the hell. whatever it was worth it. the train ride there was 6 hours...which wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be. Erik, Lindsay, Dave, and Dave's laptop are quite amusing but i knew that before. It was freaking cold up there, but they have a great subway system, with a stop across our hotel. haha didnt need to walk that much! We saw second city there, they made fun of americans A LOT. still a good show. Saw lord of the rings 2 on an IMAX which was amazing, lots of other stuff, like museums, shopping and eating. The condom shack was interesting...they had a make your own dildo kit. We went to this amazing bar, called down one and i had the best cocktail ever...lychee cocktails, soooo good. and a couple sex on the beaches.... we also lost horribly at pool, so dave and i owed lindsay and erik a lot of drinks...actually dave did, since he bought the drinks.  Wierdest thing in the world... the pool balls starting moving around when i was tryin to hit them. Thats why we lost, by the way. Saw a whole bunch of shows, drank a lot, and did what you are suppossed to do over break. it was awesome. The last night Dave and I ate at the CN tower...151 stories up and a revovling restaurant...u could see Rochester from up there. Really good food, really pricey, amazing, wonderful company :),  kinda disorienting with the view and all. Back to school, with too many tests, and way to much crap to deal with.:( Oh well, spring break makes up for it. Next year...Hawaii. Or Thailand ;)"

Ok...last night was freaking awesome! I went to the Plain White T's, Dont Look Down, Delta Force 23, Wakefield and Riddlin Kids show at water street. First off, I guess those bands arent too popular here, so there were only about 50 people there...which is weird coz the Riddlin Kids played. Dave, T, and I got there really freaking early coz we thought it would be sold out...not so much. So before the show we got to chill with the band for a little! SOOO cool. I got my shirt signed, and told them I was from Chicago, etc. So we got to talking...OMG great. This past summer I was absolutely obssessed with them, Dave Tirio esp....
IcemanRcKc (10:45:32 PM): so how did you manage to talk to dave torillo
KaTetStaRr (10:46:04 PM): so we got there really early and chilled with them
IcemanRcKc (10:47:24 PM): no i ment physically how could you talk to him.
But he wasnt as hot as I remember.... He didnt look different or anything...but Dave (boyfriend) was there, and he looked so hot he outshone Dave tirio. :)But the show was awesome, they played two new songs and dedicated them to us...coz we're cool, and I was prolly the only one jumping around goin crazy...coz thats what i do. :) So then Don't Look Down played and they were really good. Then Wakefield played, and T and Dave didnt like them, but I really did. Then the lead singer guy said something about the plain white t's and then he said I think it was you. and pointed to me. I dont know what he said...:) So then Riddlin kids played and I'm assuming that either everyone in Rochester is either 1)so out of it they dont know who they are or 2)they didnt advertise it well. But they played my 4 fave songs, AND let me sing to Crazy!  AAAHH!! so that was amazing, then we got a shirts signed, etc. and I felt really cool. haha. So, awesome night! 
It's my Anniversary! I love you baby! this morning i had a really wierd dream. I dreamt I was at a party that had something to do with my sorority, and a bunch of my friends from back home were there, including Matt McKay and Jeff Mylinski.  So, I was goin up the stairs, and then this blonde  guy in a red shirt runs by, chased by cops. He runs into the space between 2 doors, and hides but the one cop pulls him out and throws him at the ground like a foot away from me. He pulls out a gun, and points it at me. But now the guy has long shaggy brown hair and is wearing a blue shirt. Then i move to stand next to random guy, and the guy is pointing the gun at both of us. THen some guy comes up next to him with a zippo and lights something on fire, then the guy takes out a bullet, cuts it in half, and empties the powder off on his knife, the other guy lights it on fire, and guy with the gun sniffs it and falls over, a yellow breath comes out of his mouth, and he dies. Me and random girl fall over crying, and stuff. Someone yells cut, and she says, omigod u were great. u had soo many lines and didnt mess them up! I'm like thanks! and in my dream mind (what the hell is this chick talkin about?!) Then i run up the stairs yelling for Clark, then superman. then i say where are u when i need you? then i see this huge statue and a staircase leading to nowhere, and then evereyone starts to leave, so i go too. but the ppl who are running the party say, ""no one can be here after 12"" and lock the gate. They didnt hear me, but they let me out and say ""your ship is waiting for you..."" and i woke up confused
I got my BIG on Wednesday! It's Anat! but I knew, and I love her! She rocks my world!!!!
I miss Liz, Telva, and Katie! I never see you guys...:(
On a final note, thank you, sean olumstad for introducing me to the Plain White T's, and I am dreadfully sorry for not telling you before I went to the show last night. 
One more thing...HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!! Je t'aime, J'adore, Iniibig kita, Aloha wau ia 'oe, and I love you....:)"

"event","Yeah....really really need to update more...anyways, note to self:stop drinking. I had so much fun last night. Telva, me, and Pete, who was our date for the evening went to Sigma Chi's date party. OMG i dont think that i have had such a fun time here...or drank so much. PS this is after i almost faint at the cheering at the basketball game, but my theory is that the alcohol kills the bacteria that is making me sick. oh yeah. anyways, pete was our date because my baby is skiing with his familia. boo. :( but i still had an amazing time. i drank sex on the beaches mostly, plus a few blowjobs, and some buttery nipples i may have done more, but i dont remember. I told mike that this morning and he said i was a drink slut. haha. Telva and i rocked that party. Tryin to convice her to join KD. I am VERY pro-KD. Axel, Sigma Chi's dog is sooo big now. :( he was drunk too. haha. So, telva said i had to stop drinking and had to go back to the dorm (this is telva after so many drinks that she is still buzzed now. after 12 hours. im so happy shes not dead! :)) so we left and went to psi u. it was kinda dead. so we went to sam and that was fun, least the part i remember. all in all, had THE best night with my telva. even though i missed my baby. Telva had a GREAT night too, after like 5 sex on the beaches, 2 car bombs, 3 blowjobs, apple pie shots, 151 on an ice luge,and some more i cant remember. 
So, we also had a competition that was supposed to be tommorow, but i am sick, one of our flyers is throwing up and one of the back spots has a sprained ankle. boo. So, we're not goin. plus we didnt exactly have all the stunts, at least only 75% of the time we had them. 
I'm gonna go die now, from being sick and studying..."

On friday i got up at 8 in the freakin morning to make Dave breakfast, since it was our anniversary. :) its was quite cute, i dont think i have seen anyone look as confused when i woke him up. :) so we were going to got to dinner before the concert but i went with T to a modeling thing coz he wanted me to see if it was sketchy or not, which is was. I felt bad for some of the people there. sorry i guess that was mean. anyways, didnt get back till like 5 minutes before the concert, which was just amazing. they had a beatboxer come in. wow. was gonna go to the afterparty. not so much. i was dyin from being in pain from all the conditioning they have been putting us through. whatever. dave and i ended up watching AI which we have tried to watch aboot 5 times b4 but didnt end up working so well. 
Saturday i had a KD thing, then we pre-gamed and all went out. We started at Theta Dell, then went to SAM, and met Dave. all in all a great night, from the parts i remember. oops. :) Since Dave was on a date with Telva, I had 3 dates that night, :) Emily, one of my sisters, Chris Lee, and Sam Horr  was my temp when both of them left me. :) Anyways, some drama happened, but thats all fixed.

I am definately meeting some amazing people, and I clicked well with two different sororites, SDT and KD. I think I am pledging KD I had sooo much fun there. The girls are all really nice, and they like Trash TV so that is also a great perk. But, tommorow night is pref night, so we go see the ceremonies at the frat quad, which is quite far, and we need to dress up. Its gonna be freaking cold. Whatever. I really liked SDT but we shall see what happens.  I really like KD, so i hope I get an invite there tommorow. 
On another topic, one thing that is really kinda have been weighing on my mind is that I just can't  really get a grasp on what has been goin wrong in my life. I feel like I try soo hard, and I end up being mediocre. I don't know if thats it or not, but also I do so much, and it doesnt get appreciated, or noticed. maybe I'm used to having my parents, and of course my friends from back home REALLY appreciate something I do. I feel like I try soooo hard to be a good ________ (whatever) and I am still not good enough.  I feel like I need to be a better friend, but I'm really busy, so I cant hang out at Liz's with everyone else, or speak to the DP crew as much as I would like to.

I haven't updated in forever. Or maybe just a bit. I packed all my crap up today. That took forever. I packed up a whole bunch of stuff I dont really need all that crap but whatever. My last final was today, Bio, which I thought was ish but turned out it actually raped me. But you know what, its over...now I get a month off before I get overwhelmed by 5 clases, labs, studying, cheerleading, friends, and my baby.
Speaking of which, Dave left yesterday :( I have never felt more lonely when his cab drove away. But I have talked to him since he got back to Long Island...:) I really miss him. We exchanged Christmas presents on Tuesday. It was really cute, we went out to the football stadium, and opened them there. I got him a watch, since he broke his wrestling with Ken, and he got me a beautiful white gold and diamond heart necklace. AND a whole bunch of styrofoam packing peanuts, which we started popping all over the place, and then throwing at each other. That was a bitch to get out of my hair, clothes, etc. But definately worth it. :)After that we ended up (of course) in the library (of course) studying. Who freaking knew that Rochester would be so hard. Oh yeah, me. He left yesterday. :( and had a paper to write so I ended up packing his stuff up for him, which I have never done, and I know Dawson is gonna say I am totally a mom, but I liked doin it. I guess that's how I know I love him. :) 
So I'm gonna be home for break for a week, and then leave AGAIN for New York city (where I will see my PC) Massachusetts (where I will see Sarah) Connecticut (where I will see Dar Dan) Pennsylvania, and then back to New York, where I can get to spend New Year's Eve with Dave, and get a New Year's kiss! Yay! 
Jim (our janitor) is retiring tommorow. I really liked him. Liz made him brownies, and I made him a card. Which was a great feat, since I am extremely unartistic. Grar.

I get confused coz I dont wear colored socks, because they don't let my feet breathe. I don't think much of it, I figure that it might be Dave's and got mixed in with mine. Well, I go back down in like an hour to take my stuff outta the dryer, and with my clothes, pull out a pair of boxers.  So, that I think is a little weirder, since Dave usually wears boxer briefs (sorry if that is too much info)(sorry if u didnt want me to say that) So I'm upstairs foldin my laundry, and I pull out a dego with pit stains, and an XL shirt. Not so much Dave's. Grossest thing in the world! EW!
I downloaded Chamber of Secrets....ah, I love my life! Too bad there is not more footage of Oliver Wood, quidditch captain, he is freakin hot.  My sis thinks that Draco Malfoy is hot, which is kinda gross, and Ken of Gates 3 thinks that Hermione is hot, which is kinda wrong, since she is 12. 
I have so much work to do and yet I am slacking hardcore. I slept for 3 hours after cheerleading practice like from 4-7 and dave is still asleep.
So last night, Jeff calls and tells me about his show, and how they played with a band called ""what went wrong"" who really liked there music. So he puts on the demo that they gave the guys, and the first song is ""fear for the innocent"" one of Sedtion's (Jeff's band) songs.  That sux.
Went Christmas shoppin with Dave then went to Empire Brewery last night. SOOOO good. Went to High Falls, and the movies. Got the most AMAZING Salvador Dali book, a princess snowglobe, and adorable teddy bears. All in all, had an amazing day yesterday, all thanks to the most spectacular person.

After 3 days of no sleep, people usually go crazy.  One hallucination she had last night was that the smoke from the guns on the TV were coming out of the screen.  Gotta Love that girl.  She also wrote on my board that she was goin crazy from no activity. I asked her if she wanted to play in the snow, but she wanted to stay in the warm and watch Miss Congeniality. :D u missed some fun Telva!!!
Last night I went to go visit Dan (Dar Dan) and chilled with him and some of his friends for awhile.  I love that guy he is great. :D He showed me his prom pics where he wore an american flag cummerbund. Freakin Hillarious. Story behind that is that is the people at his school used to call him ""all american boy"" or somethin like that since he was class prez, 4th in his class, played baseball, and acts like the traditional all american kid. 
Dave and I played in the snow last night! It was ""fried chicken"" fun. :D We made snow angels, and I freakin rocked him in a snow fight. hee. We were wrestling (Brett and Rachel style...prob. not as long though!)and some kids walked by and were like ""should we call security!?"" jokingly. We couldnt make a snowman though coz it wasnt packing snow. :( He told me last night that if u are really cold, and need to stay warm, u dig a hole in the snow and stay in there, and it will be warmer. WHY?????!!!!! I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!! Snow is cold. Therefore, why would u want to be in it?! Anyways...today is the seventh, I can't believe it's only been this long... I LOVE YOU BABY!!!"

"event","Ok...So it's not like I don't adore cheerleading, but this is getting to be really hard.  My arms are freakin killin me. I was a back spot yesterday, which I have never done before. This was really wierd considering I am usually a flier, and the shortest person on the team shouldn't be a back spot. Another thing, I freakin pulled my groin doin a toe touch. OW. Anyways, we have our second game on Wednesday, so everyone here at UR should come. Coz I say so. :) Just kidding, but we are pretty good for being a team for the last like week. Maybe longer, but counting break...anyways...
So I took a psych survey and it said I am basically bi-polar. Can I get some sort of group consensus that the dumb test is wrong? Or at least lie to me or something. It also said I have issues with relationships with authority figures. I was like screw u, and hit the instructor. Just Kiddin. :) 
FINALS ARE GONNA BE HELL!! U know that the school is tough when they give u a study period of like  5 days before finals start. GAH.
I miss the whole DP crew, bein back home for a little while was a lot of fun....I can't wait to see everyone again! But I will miss Liz's analogies, Telva's random attempts to stay up for 72 hours, Katie's obviousness, Sarah's attempts to make me buy pants that fit me, Matt's toaster, Jordan's laugh, Gary's randomness, Tony's mix CD's, Erik's running into the hallway anytime anyone says the word ""naked"", and Dave's smile.....:)
Anyways....must clean the room. Later Days."

"event","Boo. Guess what. My amazing immune system has totally failed me at college. Boo. Now, I'm thinkin it is either Bobby or Dave's fault (BJ Dave for the DP crew). Not to blame either of you or anything. I just am thinkin out loud.  Really, really hope that I'm not sick during finals.
 Also I have decided that I am one of the worst people on the face of the earth for hurting one of the nicest guys on the planet. I don't think that I have ever felt worse about what I have done. I don't regret doing it , but, I regret hurting Jeff. I can't help the way that I feel, and he was right with what he said, I am in love with Dave, but that is past knowledge.  I guess it just sucks sometimes, that people and feelings need to be sacrificed for ambition and other people. That sounds horrible.I read a note he gave me before I left for New York, and I just suck. That's it. 
On some other notes, I rearranged my room (thanks Matt and PC) and its freakin freezin in here. And I missed my Psych and Bio classes this morning since I just woke up. I hate being sick. PS-Dawson I hope you feel better from what's buggin you, Jules-Don't worry, be happy, remember Adam if your sad, Sean-hihihihihihihihihihihihihihi, Brettie-she kinda does look like Justin Timeberlake, Bobby- I REALLY like Hollie! She is freakin awesome. (and like i said before, quite a ""niiiice girl""...hee)"

"event","I never ever thought that school would be this frustrating.  I hate finals, and the closest one i have is 9 days away. I know i am a freak for studying so soon but whatever.  Anyways, last night telva, dave, and i were in Gary and Jordan's room, and I walked in and gary is wearing his soccer cleats in his bed.  Turns out he also wears them in the shower so they will mold to his foot.  Wierd. Then Gary says a whole bunch of random things, i think he beats even me on the random scale. 
    1.If i got a shirt like that i would put something wierd on the back of it, like....Gary
    2.I have a 15 year old brother who is obnoxious, and a 12 year old sister who is partially retarded.  My 9 year old sister who i gave birth to helps me with my calculus. Haven't you ever seen Junior?
    3. Telva says ""I have cankles"" (keep in mind Telva is litter than me....ish) and pulls up her pant leg. Gary says, You have chicken legs, i'd like to put u on a rotissere. 
    4. This is one of Telva's ""Rochester is not a good school. Its just here, I come here everyday"" Riiiiigght...we all do. 
Anyways maybe i was the only person who found that entertaining. I thought i would bring sunshine into your lives. BTW (or PS) I really like that u guys are using ""ish"" now (sean and i thought i saw it on dawson's) Now i have more years of Psych to do. boo."

"event","YAY!!! I finally have a live journal deal.  This makes me quite happy. So i got back to my dorm last night at like 10:30 and got to see my friends, who i missed terribly this weekend, although i did get to see the DP crew, who i absolutely adore, since they are some of my favorite people in the world.  Hanging out with the guys makes me miss the immaturity of high school, but i got my fill of that this weekend. Just Kidding guys. Actually I'm not i missed it!  So i got this wonderful live journal thingy from Julie, who is the perfect female friend, very much like my best friend, who happens to be her bro.  yay.  Anyways, this weekend was great with a few sniffles, :( and some all out sobbing, but I'm sure most of the people who will read this already know what is goin on.  So i was really glad to be back at school to see all my friends and Dave, who I missed terribly :).  I think it is gonna be ok this time, since I will be back in three weeks, just with gray hair and wrinkles from finals.  Yes, finals that I am currently studying for, which Liz of course will give me much shit aboot. :)"

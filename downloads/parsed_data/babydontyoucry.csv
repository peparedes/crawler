"event","I looked back through this the other night... Seven years of moments in my life are catalogued in here.  I never thought this site would have even been around for that long but here it is.  All my posts still remain and it serves as an odd window into what my life was and has been.  At times it's been slightly distorted due to whoever I thought may be reading but it was still me.  How crazy it is to see it all again...

I never thought in a million years I would be an alcoholic and have to seek help in the form of a 90 day rehab, but that was the path that my life took.  For a year prior I abused alcohol and to some extent drugs, on an endless cycle of uppers and downers.  I led a miserable existence that was clearly visible to everyone around me.  Palmetto Addiction Recovery Center, outside of Rayville, Louisiana, became my home for 94 days.  I don't think I'll ever forget it...

....

Three years ago tomorrow, I was in a hospital room with my family and my girlfriend, Karrie, watching my grandfather take his final breaths.  It was the most surreal moment of my life.  My hero, my second father, a man I loved and respected, that helped raise me as as an infant - passed away before my eyes.  He died from a combination of strokes and seizures that had formed a heavy blood clot on his brain... He was 89 years old and only a shell of the man that used to wrestle me in tickle fights or take me to hit a million tennis balls all over Tulsa area parks.  Those days had long passed.  And the one who was too stubborn for hearing aids or computers or cell phones, who hated riding in cars when he was not the driver had lived his final years in nursing homes and assisted living centers away from my grandmother, the love of his life.

I had received a call only hours before, to get to the hospital, that he wasn't going to make it through the night, that they were pulling his feeding tube... At the time I was living with Karrie, and I had just gotten a DUI and had my license suspended.  We were up that night, listening to music and playing around in our apartment.  We were a new couple, but in love.  We quickly grabbed our coats and shoes and left.  We drove to the hospital that night in the misting rain holding hands in silence.  She would squeeze tight and look at me with caring eyes but there were no words.  

When we arrived at St. John's Hospital we were greeted by my family:  Caroline, Jann and Don, Worden and Kay, my Mom and Price, and Gammy, my grandmother.  All ten of us held hands and prayed in a circle around Papa.  My uncle Earl from Oregon on the phone listened as we did.  And we all stood there and shared stories that we had all heard told a million times at family gatherings.  Little things we loved about him and that drove us all insane.  And how much he meant to each one of us.  And then we said our goodbyes.  And because he and I were the closest they looked to me to start it.  

Later that night my grandmother pulled me out into the hall and told me something I'll never forget.  That it was up to me to keep this family together and going.  I had to fill Papa's shoes and I was more than up to the task.  I looked into her eyes and promised her I would.  I was 21 years-old and could barely dress myself it seemed.  But I made a promise like I could keep it.  


Only in these past few months have I been really thinking about what it means to be like my grandfather.  Before I thought it was literally doing the impossible but now I know it's much, much different.  It simply means being a good man and doing what is right and necessary.  It means taking care of my family and others and never asking for anything in return.  And if I do all of that, all will be right in my life.  

I used to hope he wasn't watching me.  But now I pray that he is and he's proud."

"event","I have no one to talk to.  Well, I take that back.  Yeah, there are people that I can come to with my problems but I'm not sure they will understand.  Or maybe it's really that I don't want them to think less of me.   It's easier here, typing to no one in particular (and more likely no one at all) to be completely candid.

They say I am an alcoholic.  And this whole lifestyle of being sober and talking and acting conscientiously has been forced upon me, the whole while I feel compelled not to drink but to run and be left alone.  I just want to be left alone...

They say these steps can help me, whether my problems be in my head or in the bottle.  I say I am fine.  I know what I need and it doesn't lie in the hands of a higher power, it lies in my own.  I need to find what I truly want out of this life and I need to dedicate myself to getting it.

They say the more I rebel against the truth of my own alcoholism, the more surely that I am indeed one of them.  But I feel that this is faulty reasoning and therefore an invalid conclusion.  I am merely someone who retreated to alcohol out of circumstance and as a means to cope.

I am not like you, I say.  I'm different.

But it all leads in circles because just as easily as I can point to where our paths part, they can point to where they cross.   And then they smile, and say, I've been there before.

Who wants to be an alcoholic at twenty-four?  Who wants to be faced with the reality that their life as they know it will never be the same because they have been given something few others have been so privileged to have - awareness.  I know my limitations and they conflict with my inner desires. I want to be happy but on my own terms.  I want to be like normal people.  But they say that ship has sailed and all that's left is the path before me.  It's there if you want it.  Or you can do it your way because that worked so well before...



God damn't.  I guess I'll give it one more try."

"event","I'm doomed to like the girl that doesn't like me.  My fear of commitment has officially been magnified from yellow to red over the past year and I see no change in sight.  It's like my inner self has taken a page from the Karl Rove guide to politics and used especially scary anecdotes to any romantic encounter I have - like ""She's just being nice, don't trust her!"" or ""Did you see that look?  She's just not that into you.""

I mean, what's the matter with me?  Back in the day, I got turned down all the time!  This should be easy for me.  I used to take this stuff in stride, right?  But i guess, when you're straddling the brink of ultimate depression, you tend to go the safer route for your own survival... which is not pursuing anyone/anything.

Currently, I like... let's call her ""Girl A"" and then I also like this other girl, ""Girl B"".  Girl A and I have been friends for an extended period of time but she now hates me because I'm an idiot.  And Girl B is just a girl that I think is really cool but am not sure if there's a future in it (I don't really know her well enough).  But neither of these two girls am I willing to actually make a move for because rejection seems like a sting that might be too difficult to overcome at the moment.

But anyway, Girl B and I are probably a no go just because I'm not sure if she has a boyfriend even (it's never really come up), yet I shamelessly flirt with her...  I should probably make sure, cause if she is with someone, that's wrong of me...  flirting with another guy's girlfriend is on my list of things NOT to do.

Anyway, other than that, hardly anything is new in my life.  I was extremely depressed and reclusive about a month and a half ago, for no real reason at all.  But anyway, I kind of made myself scarce.  I still don't like to go out much or meet new people... Yet, when I'm with people I feel like I have to constantly crack jokes and make them laugh?  Like tonight, we had our annual holiday meeting at work, and I constantly had to crack jokes for no reason...  and although they were good, and everyone laughed, it made me feel a little weird making them.  I guess, someone has to be the funny guy (though, I don't think of myself as that funny)?

I went to a Pete Yorn concert last night with Emily.  We got free tickets from Andrew who couldn't go, and it was a really amazing show, no matter how much Em tried to downplay it.  She loved it, she knows it!  Heh, and we also saw Sean Presley with Caitlin Cleary - the second time in a row I saw them at a concert there, the other was the Stills and Kings of Leon.  Anyway, I had a good time and got to give emily shit for her little romance with some dude that I can't say... Heh.

The other day I saw a friend of Lisa Wilkerson's at Reasor's that remembered me, yet I didn't her.  Anyway, it was pretty strange and I asked her how the family was doing, though she hadn't spoken with them in a while either.  But before I left, she said ""too bad Rachel made a huge mistake"" which was nice to say, but probably very inacurrate... But I didn't argue, just said thanks and walked out.

If anything, I think I was the mistake nowadays.  And I'm okay with that... as long as I change.

"event","As I sit typing on my computer, at my desk, in my room, inside our new house, I realize I'm probably doing it for the last time.  After suffering for almost a year in parental captivity, tomorrow I will finally be on my own in a new apartment.  Thank you God.

And let me tell you, I'm quite pleased with my new digs.  So maybe I'll finally have a little stability for a while?  Well, I will for at least the next six months until the lease runs out... Anyway, move-in day is tomorrow, and being that it is also a school day, I plan on being extremely busy, especially because I have to do it all in one day.  Because that's just how I roll.  It shouldn't be too bad though, I'm practically a professional mover now (this is my fifth move in a little more than year).


So I was thinking I need a tatoo.  I'm not exactly sure why, other than the fact that it seems like I <i>need</i> to have one.  It's even a little surprising that I <i>haven't</i> gotten one.  I guess the main thing standing in my way is that whole ""I can't think of anything worth tatooing onto my body, and not be embarassed/ashamed of when I'm 75 and it's all faded and wrinkled, etc.""

But that argument doesn't really work, since I doubt I'll ever live to be that old.  

I hope.

So anwyay, people, help me out.  Any suggestions?


Lately I've been running quite a lot.  It's almost gotten to be a problem because I don't feel right if I don't have at least a quick jog before I hit the hay (or maybe it's yog with a soft ""j"", I'm not sure).  I guess this isn't such a bad problem, but I seriously fucking hate running.  Seriously.  And when I don't run I'm a total asshole to everyone - even moreso than normal - so it is indeed quite the dilemma.  If anyone knows of any other sport that takes little to no skill but is somewhat enjoyable, please, let me know.  


Alright, I'm going to go read now, because I have no life and am a total nerd.  By the way, Andy, if you're reading this, ""Killing Yourself to Live"" by Chuck Klosterman is really really good; much better than his other one, so thanks for the rec!



Keepin' it real.

"event","School has started again as the summer's heat slowly fades into fall.  A new year, new faces, new apartment (well, on september 1st anyway), and I'm actually excited about going to class.  It is, indeed, strange.  I can safely say that a year ago I would've never thought I'd be where I am now.  What a difference a year makes?

So I'm taking another crack at French this year.  I'm going to try this crazy thing called studying and attending class.  I hear it works pretty well, so I thought I'd give it a go.  Actually, I found Rachel's French Dictionary that she gave me when I decided to take it my freshman year at OU.  She had taken it all through highschool and was actually pretty good at it.  I, on the otherhand, was terrible at pronunciation and never kept up with my work and on and on, but I digress.  So when she gave me the dictionary she wrote me a sweet note inside which I'll share:


<i>Drewzer,

So maybe Francois is as hard as I told you, eh?  
Anyway, hopefully you'll use this and learn more from it than I ever did.  
Keep workin' hard - I'm proud of you!

<3 Rach
(P.S. I love you!)</i>


I still have several notes she wrote me, ranging from little I-love-you's written on some scrap paper to several paged littanies - I kept just about everything.  And you might think it hurts me to see that stuff, but really it's just the opposite.  It's nice to know that for however brief a moment, I was in love with a girl and she was in love with me.  Nothing else matters.  And that in itself is comforting and something I'll always cherish.  

Well, I'm off to class.  Keep it real, kiddo's!

"event","New update as promised...

It's been so long since I've written in this thing that I really don't know where to begin, but here it goes anyway...

We're in the new house and it's really nice but a lot smaller.  And with Parrish being home too, it just makes it that much more crowded, almost to the point of suffocation.  Actually, I'd probably feel suffocated even if he wasn't here.  I just need to get the fuck out.

In less than two weeks I will be almost completely alone.  But maybe that's good?  I need to take care of school this next semester, get some more hours and keep on track... Heh, though exactly what I'm on track for is still up in the air.  Everything is up in the air.  The only thing I'm sure of is I'm going to have to start over wherever I go.  It seems like that's the only constant.

I have so many regrets and they keep rolling over in my mind; what I would change, what I wish happened, and what I thought would happen.  I was so naive, the typical high schooler cliche'.  As much as I thought I was smarter than that, I wasn't.  My whole life is a do-over...

For some reason the past week has been extremely hard for me to get through, and then last night it all sort of came to a head.  I got drunk (which wasn't entirely my fault) and wanted to drive myself home so I could sit alone and mope.  But thankfully, my friends wouldn't let me... so I tried to fight/get away from them and ended up breaking down right there, in Andy's front lawn.  I just couldn't hold it in anymore, I guess.

The only reason I keep going is because of my friends.  I love them and they are always there for me and I don't deserve it.  They stick with me through all of my bullshit sob stories rehashed a thousand times... Heh, I guess I'm the luckiest loser ever.

Well, I'm going to end this post before it gets any more homosexual than it already is.  Hopefully, updates will be more frequent but I guarantee nothing!

Isn't it fucked up, I've yet to be carded at any bar or liquor store I go into and that's basically the only reason I go!  Oh well, maybe I should take it as a compliment?  Whatever.

I've started writing again, which is the first time in a good while that I've even thought about it.  It's about the same ole bullshit, so it's nothing new and no one's missing out.  I've only showed it to a few people and both were like ""is there more??? i want to read more!"" so that's encouraging, I guess.   We'll see if I can follow through with this one, but don't count on it.

The classes I'm taking are so easy, I'm almost ashamed to take them, except they count all the same and it give me something to do over the summer.  I have a class at 9 a.m. tomoorrow evem, which i'll make but do i fee the need to rest up before hand?  No.  Thus is the difference.  

I think I'm gonna take bar tending classes in late July, but we'll see how that goes.

In other news I'll be going to visit Drew in Europe during Christmas break and hopefully we'll travel anywhere our heart desires.  I must say, if I was gonna travel with any of my good friends it would've been Drew, so that makes things about a 10000 times better.  Anyway, take it easy, kids!

"event","Four straight years, no wrecks, maybe a few dings here and there, but nothing bad.  Now, in less than one I get into two major accidents, both because of texting on my cell phone.  I know... I'm an idiot.

I was driving along, took my eyes off the road for a few seconds, then looked up and saw a white Mercedes SUV at a dead stop.  Before I could hardly touch my breaks I smashed into its backend.  The airbags went off.  Smoke and that horrible burning smell filtered in through the air conditioner.  I started shaking uncontrollably.  I fumbled around my car as I tried to get my bearings.  After deciding that this was in fact happening, I put the car in park, grabbed my insurance info and got out to check on the people in the Mercedes.

They had pulled over into a parking lot a few feet away, so I stumbled over in a complete daze.  I kept asking, ""Is everyone alright?  Anybody hurt?  I'm so sorry, are you okay?""  A couple little kids ran out of the car in tears, saw me coming towards them, then ran to the driver's side calling for their mom.  I wanted to die.  I had hit a little family's car, a mom with her three little kids, the oldest was probably 10, a little boy, and his two sisters, probably 6 and 8.  I am a piece of shit.  I am an asshole.

They were all okay.  The mom had a few bruises but other than that, not a scratch.  They were all wearing seat belts.  Everyone was just really shaken up.

But seeing that mom and her kids, it was all too much and I hated myself.  They were all alright, but if they weren't, I could've never forgiven myself...  Heh, the ten year old kid even tried to console me after a while.  I was pretty upset...

The police arrived, talked with the mom and me.  Turns out the family used to be our neighbors and actually knew my parents.  Price and the father (who arrived later and was also extremely nice) play tennis together occasionally.  I got a ticket for a $120 but it could've been much worse.  My mom and little sister got there after a little bit and drove me home.  The car got towed, and I've already reported the wreck with my insurance.  Talk about a terrible day.


Yesterday was better.  I went on a date with a girl that I really like and enjoy hanging out with.  She wants to go out again soon, but she's out of town again this weekend, so I'm thinking Tuesday night probably.  New relationships are fun, but I usually hate first dates and this one went really well I thought.  So I'm crossing my fingers.

Other than that, I work on Saturday night and then I'm going to my Dad's on Sunday for my step-bro's big 21st birthday.  But right now, I'm emotionally drained, so I'm going to take it easy and stay in tonight.

Friday we had our float trip that we'd been talking about for a month.  We had planned for everyone to meet at my house at 9am (the thinking being that out of the six of us, I was the least likely to wake up), hit up the grocery store for food and beer, and be out on the road by about 9:30 or 9:45.  Well, a few people were hard to get a hold of *cough*trip*cough*, but we were on the road by 10:15-ish, so close enough.  I actually woke up at 7 with a sore throat and made a few mix CD's for the drive down- I knew if I didn't they would force me to listen to Pat Green...  But yeah, so we got to the river by 11:30 with all of us except for Nate (he drove) a little tipsy.  We rented out three canoes, Andy and I in one, Trip and Jonathan, and Charlie and Nate in the others, and headed out.  Everyone got very drunk, and very dumb and it was awesome.  Of course that led to each of us flipping a canoe at one point or another, but our food didn't get ruined, we lost no beer, and I made sure we didn't litter at all because I <3 the ozone (I was constantly being called a hippy, smokey the bear, ranger drew, etc.).  All in all, it rocked.  I got home at about 4:30 and crashed for an hour slightly sunburnt and still very drunk.

Later that night was our second night of Mayfest, I got drunk again, had a few laughs, met a girl, then went to a party after and yadda yadda yadda... it turned out to be a pretty good night.

So good in fact, that I woke up the next day with a sore throat and no vice, stuffed up nose and a massive headache.  Oh well.

Originally the plan was to take about 9 or 10 but after talking to my dad he convinced me just to do around 6 or 7. His reasoning was it's summer, the courses are shorter, and I'm going to be working on top of it all.  So that's the plan.

Finally a lot of my friends are getting back into town, most of them this weekend or next.  Finally.  This past year has been one of the longest in my life, and I didn't even take any classes!  Tomorrow I think I'm going to make a friend of mine go to a movie with me and hang out.  I haven't seen her in forever so it'll be nice to catch up me thinks.

I got the new Snow Patrol album today.  So far it's good, not great but good all the same.  I also bought a new book, ""Tomcat In Love"" by Tim O'Brien.  I read a chapter at the store, not bad.  I still have to finish the Dave Eggers short story book I'm reading, but I'm almost through it.  ""Thumbsucker"" by Walter Kirn was pretty good too.  I finished it a few days ago...  You can't tell I've been bored can you?  Heh.

"event","I haven't felt like updating this thing, still don't but here it goes anyway.

I've decided not to go to OU next fall.  After much debate I think my best option is to go to TU and get my own apartment.  I know it sounds like I just made a total 180 from what I was saying five months ago, but yeah, it's the smarter move.  Right now I'm applying, so cross your fingers for me and all that.

For a little while I was afraid of being fired from Barnes and Noble.  I've been going/staying out later and later, and it was beginning to become a problem with me waking up in the morning.  I was constantly late, which is something I hate, and I really thought my boss was getting pissed.  But now I've fixed things and he likes me again, and all is well.

Recently I've hung out with Adam and his new girlfriend, Brittany, (I say new, but they've been together for over a month now) quite a bit.  I work out occasionally, although not enough.  I read a little.  I play guitar just about everyday.  Watch movies.  Work.  Nothing special.

A few weeks ago Brittany tried to set me up with her best friend, Meredith.  We both liked each other and it probably would've worked except she's 22 and graduating this week from TU, and I'm 20 and unsure about my future.  Of course, I didn't have any problem with dating an older girl, but apparently she had a problem with dating a younger guy.  We hung out a couple of times and before anything could happen it was over.  She told Brittany that she really liked me and she was worried if we dated that she'd really really like me and the next guy she dates she wants to be able to marry or think about marriage with and blah blah blah.  

So that was interesting to hear.  Definitely the first girl that ever talked about marriage like it was something she wanted soonish, which freaks me out a little.  That makes me feel really old.  Am I old?  I really don't know anymore.  I feel old.

I'll be 21 in less than two months.  Freaky.

I'm going to Brittany's to hang out with her and Adam, and third-wheelin' it up!  But what's crazy is I don't feel like a third-wheel with them.  Strangeness indeed.



Peace out playa's,

"event","I'm bored so I decided to make a Best Music of 2005 list.  Yeah, I know it's April of 2006, but I don't care.  I needed something to do, so here it is:

1.  Sufjan Stevens

3.  Death Cab for Cutie
- ""Plans""
4.  Broken Social Scene

Most Overrated:

Coldplay - ""X & Y""
Beck - ""Guero""
Gorillaz - ""Demon Days""
The Magic Numbers - ""The Magic Numbers""
M.I.A - ""Arular""

Yeah, I said it, they were overrated.  Demon Days had a few good tracks (Feel Good Inc. was obviously really good) but for the most part I didn't enjoy it.  Arular had some good beats and was okay, but I don't get the love affair with the album.  I do however, get the love affair with her ;).  The Magic Numbers are just terrible.  Guero was a major dissapointment after so many people told me it was great.  X & Y... ugh.


So that's it.  I'm sure I left off a few, actually I know I did.  Most noticeably The White Stripes, The Mars Volta or even Neil Young.  This was not a mistake.  I didn't listen to these albums enough to include them or go off on them.  So yeah, this is just my personal favorites, not the actual <i>best</i>.  Anyway, I'm out of here.  Catch you all later.

"event","The reason for the lack of regular updates is not because I've been too busy... actually, it's just the opposite.  Life is moving slowly by and still things are slipping through my fingers.  I'm incredibly worried about next fall, where I'll be going to school, where I'll be living, or if I'm in for another repeat.  I don't think I could do that... The anxiety is killing me, to the point where it's crippling and I'm in a constant state of panic.  The kind where you're afraid to do anything, so you do nothing...


Six months have passed by, and not in a blink.  I still think about everything a lot, relive certain moments good and bad.  Heh, I've got quite a bit of time to reflect... too much.

I want to talk to Rachel.  I think about this more and more, and I'm sure most people would consider it to be a bad idea, but I don't.  My reasons for it aren't the same as they were when I wanted to talk to her 5 months ago.  Then I wanted to get back together, now I want to know why she hates me or despises or whatever.  I think it's obvious she doesn't like me, and I think I deserve to know why.  I sacrificed a lot for her and I don't hate <i>her</i>.  So why should she hate me?  I don't want her friendship, and I don't want an apology (not that she'd give one), I just want to know why she appears mad at me.

Hmm... Price just walked in here looking for my mom and everyone, asked how my day was and was pretty nice.  That was about five minutes ago.  I didn't think anything of it until I just glanced around the room and looked at a few of the empty beer bottles on the table and the case in the corner.  If you don't know him, then that's probably not a big deal.  But for a guy that does, and feared him throwing me out of the house if he caught me drinking/drunk for all of highschool and even last year when I was home, that's a big deal.  Yes, yes, I know I'll be 21 in less than three months, but seriously even then I'll have trouble drinking in front of the guy.  It'd just be weird...

Speaking of Price, tomorrow is his birthday.  I'd buy him a present if there was anything I thought he'd remotely like, but I'll probably just try to find a nice card.  He's a big card guy.


Tonight will consist of watching the OC, maybe running and then watching TV until I fall asleep sometime around 3.  I am so bored.  Someone save me.

"event","Yesterday I went shopping for some new clothes with my little sister.  We went to the mall and let me tell you, I hate, HATE the mall.  I feel so awkward walking around in there with all of those... mall people.  For those of you that don't know, mall people are quite an eclectic group of ""individuals"".  You've got your preps with their popped collars, khaki shorts and pre-frayed baseball hats or over spiked hair.  Then there are the highschool skanks in low cut tops and push up braws, with pre-torn jeans of course.  And for some reason there are always a good number of goths walking around dressed all in blank with metal chains all over them.  You would think it would be against their morals to hang out at the mall, but apparently not... And then there are always a lot of the completely unattractive and untrendy types milling about.  As well as overweight adults that look like they just rolled out of bed.

I hate it.

In each department store my little sister dragged me into I felt completely out of place and strange.  I've never been a good shopper though, I don't know how I guess.  That weird feeling never wears off.  I constantly have an overwhelming urge to sprint out the door.

But I did end up buying a few things at the Fossil store.  Just a few collared shirts and one t-shirt.  Finding stuff I like proved to be quite difficult...

My cell phone is acting up and it's pissing me off.  It turns off by itself for no reason and I don't understand it.  If i have to buy a new phone, I'm gonna be mad.

I close at work tonight.  Should be okay... I picked up those ap's from a few restaurants, so we'll see how those turn out.  I think at least one of them will call me back soon, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.  It'll be good to have less free time, trust me.  But now, I better go to B&N.  If I'm late, I'm in deep shit.

See ya guys,

"event","<i>My past self wrote this to me late last night.  It was about 4am and I was slightly delirious with insomnia.  Because I'm lazy and realize I need an update, I figure this will suffice for now. Oh, and I think I was watching a few episodes of the OC I have on dvd, hence the last bit.</i>



Things you better do tomorrow, Drew:
1. Go to work... ON TIME or at least at 8:30 even if you're about 99% sure you're supposed to be there at 9:00
2. Pay your speeding ticket and call Noble County Court House to figure out about court time.
3. Work out.  And by working out I mean run AND lift weights.
4. Enroll at TCC for summer classes.  Either go downtown or do it online but you have to do it before 5:00, so really this needs to be more towards the top of your list.
5. Talk to mom about your living situation and how you probably will have to live by yourself.  I know it's depressing but fucking do it, man.  It needs to be done.
6. This is more of a maybe if you have time, but you should do it if you get the chance: go to Full Moon and Hideaway and at the very least pick up an application.  Try to fill it out quickly, you need get on this job hunt thing.

Things you might do if you have time:
1. Go shopping.  Buy yourself some new clothes.  You're in dier need of new threads.
2. Read/Buy new books.  Dave Eggers and Haruki Murakami have books you need to read.
3. Call your dad if you get a chance... even now I'm not so crazy about this idea.
4. Contact Diane Morrow to inquire about voice and piano lessons.  Talk to mom about this too, maybe she'll help out with paying for it?
5. Get your CD's and DVD back from Adam and return his.  I know you're slightly nervous about talking to him because of the Magen situation, but bite the bullet man, and nut up.


And download this shit as well:

I Am Kloot
Mojave 3
""Love of the Loveless"" by the Eels
""Hello Sunshine"" by Super Furry Animals
""Leaving Trains"" by James William Hindle

Goddamn, find yourself a Summer... you need one.

"event","We're completely moved in, have been for over a week now, but I didn't have cable or internet until Thursday.  Since then I've been slightly busy and really didn't want to update this, but I guess I will now because I'm bored.

My new room is pretty nice except for a few things.  There isn't a real closet... at all.  I have my ironed shirts and pants laid out carefully in a nice stack in a corner.  The main entrance is a staircase, which has no door whatsoever.  At night if people are in the kitchen their voices carry up the stairs and bounce off the high ceilings.  It's frustrating.  I have no shower in my side of the house, and the bathroom I do have has a black toilet which that is just weird and just trust me, never get a black toilet...  There is a balcony which at first I thought was awesome until Price told me it wasn't supported well and could collapse if I went out on it.  I just know someone, not necessarily me, is going to get really drunk and wander out there and then wham!  The balcony along with my drunk friend, collapse onto my parents cars parked in the driveway below.  

Other than that, it's pretty sweet.  It's probably the biggest room in the house, so there's lots of space, that I take full advantage of.  All my stuff is sprawled out across the room and it's kind of a mess but I'm lazy and refuse to organize stuff too much.

Lots of people are back in town for spring break or at least for part of it, so I hope to be busy.  The shitty part is that I have to Thursday, Friday and Saturday this weekend... I'm gonna try and fix that though.



So I've been thinking a lot lately and it finally occurred to me that in a weird way Rachel is ""dead"" to me.  Haha, I say that as a joke a lot, but in this instance that's what it's like.  It feels just like she died and I'll never see her again or be her friend, and I don't know...  I'm not mad, and I don't care anymore, and I still think she/they were in the wrong, but I feel like there's this huge missing piece in my chest.  Something that seems impossible to heal...  And I want it to so badly.



Enough about that.  Tonight I'm hanging out with the guys and we might go to a concert but I'm not really sure?  We'll see.


Later

"event","I've been emptying my drawers and wrapping pictures frames to pack away in UHaul boxes.  In the corner I have a stack of VHS tapes and terrible books that were given to me as presents years ago, a few crappy CD's, just stuff.  This is my give-away/throw away pile.  As I sift through papers I have to decide if they're trash or meaningful in some way.  There's birthday cards and graduation cards, random notes, papers from highschool and even some from middle school.  There's letters from girls, postcards, ticket stubs from concerts and plays, all of which I have to look at... again.  I know why I've been putting this off...  But anyway, here's an excerpt from a paper I wrote for Fr. Sheridan's class in 9th grade, 'tis weird:

<i>As the clock slowly ticks away in the 3rd hour class I begin to get anxious... when the bell rings.  This is not just a regular bell, but it signifies the beginning of lunch.  I rush out of the room and into the hall only to be joined by a large mass of people.  But i do not despair for I know I will soon sit at our table.  The place where everyday I join my friends to sit, eat and tell stories.  It's a release from the pressures of school and makes even the toughest day that much easier.  This type of companionship is also seen in novels...""</i>

Apparently, I've always liked to write with a dramatic flair, heh.  

So I was mistaken.  Tomorrow is my last night in the house.  And I don't know what I think about that, or if I even care.

Who is coming to Tulsa during spring break?  Inquiring minds (myself) want to know, so be sure to clue me in on when you're getting back, if at all, and I'll plan accordingly.

Oh, and happy Mardi Gras, everybody!

"event","God or Whoever is in charge of the weather needs to pick a temperature and stick with it.  I don't care if it's hot or cold, sunny or cloudy.  Just as long as it's fucking consistant.  Last week it went from being around 17 degrees with snow on the ground to 65 and sunny in two days.  Then this weekend it dipped back down in the thirties only to be back at mid-60's again today.  It seems like everything around me can't make up it's mind one way or the other.  I'll be happy when February is finally over.  Crazy how the shortest month has also been the longest.

Tomorrow night will be the last time I sleep in my old house.  13 1/2 years.  Not so much a chapter of my life as it is an entire book, coming to a close.  Funny how growing up I used to hate this house and all the crap I got for living here... Which, I guess, seems ungrateful and doesn't make much sense to most people.  But I think if you know me, then you know I realize how lucky I am, which is what's so frustrating.  I don't deserve what I have and as a result I've never felt comfortable with it.  Yeah, if I lived in some sort of squalor I wouldn't be happy either, and I'd probably hate little bastards like me that didn't fully appreciate what they have.  Even thinking about it now makes me hate myself for it.  But... eh, I should just shut-up.  

The rental house is litterally three blocks away.  I think I told you that already, but that was before I had seen it.  It's a really nice house.  Not your typical ""rent"" home, which I normally picture as being small and nice enough to live in, but not <i>really</i> live in.  Hmm... hanging prepositions.  It seems like I use those quite a bit...  ""proper"" English is such bullshit anyway.  Open up a newspaper or a magazine and not only do the articles have poorly written content, but the grammar is a complete joke.  And I mean in the lame I-used-a-period-instead-of-a-semicolon-way, not the creative, stylistic way.  Every time I read a contemporary novel it seems like my 5th grade English teacher, would've just torn the motherfucker apart, leaving the page soaked in red ink.  Actually, I think I remember her sometimes grading with green or blue ink too.  Mrs. James.  Why do I remember that?

I'm not saying that I'm any better with punctuation and all that.  But I'm not paid to be a writer either...

Wow, okay, that's enough for me.  Obviously, I can't think about one thing for more than five seconds before going off on another tangent.

So tonight and tomorrow: Packing and moving shit and then more packing and moving... fuck.  

I'll catch you guys later me hopes.

"event","It's amazing how quickly someone can make you feel so small and stupid.  You see that look in their eyes and how it's changed and nothing is what you thought it was.  Everything's suddenly different.  Your chest becomes heavy and your cheeks tight.  All the things that you thought you'd say, rehearsed a hundred times in your head so that you would get it right, vanish in a blink.  Leaving you alone, where all you can do is swallow hard and walk away.  

I've felt this way once before.  It was three years ago but I remember it perfectly, except the perspective has changed and the scene plays more like a movie in my head.  One in which I'm sitting in the stands, watching this younger version of myself.   I see his face as her words cut through him like knives.  As he drives away and curses himself for being such an idiot, for caring about her so much.  As he lies in bed broken and wide awake.  And as he tries to think of something, anything to make it go away.

It was the first time I'd really had my heart broken.  It felt like my whole world was caving in on itself and there was nothing I could do.  I was trapped.  

But now, this time, it's different.  

It's easier for me to let go, and it's easier for me to walk away..."

Piles of books, magazines, lamps, and random nick-nacks are scattered across the kitchen floor along with boxes and bubble wrap.  Desks, chairs, coffee tables, oriental rugs, a couple couches and a lot of other large pieces of furniture are crowded in the living and dining rooms.  Items that vary from old Halloween decorations, to souvenirs from old vacations, to sets of dishes and glasses are spilled across the tops of a few card tables with blue table-cloths.  Other random junk, a French wrought iron shelf thing, some fake ivy plants, tools, VHS tapes, just random crap has all been dumped in the entry hall.  Signs saying ""KEEP OUT"" are posted on several doors, which are also roped off.

Outside there are seven cars parked in our backyard that I've never seen before.  They belong to the people that are helping my mom set up this whole ""Estate Auction"" thing.  When I was walking inside earlier I noticed several of them had stickers on their back windows that said ""Rhema"", which is a bible college/church in Broken Arrow.  I immediately worried that my mom had unknowingly hired crazy religious zealots for help.  But really, they seem nice enough... so far.

Tonight my Dad is coming into town and we're going out to dinner.  Since he doesn't work anymore because he sold his business and struck a little oil, he's been finding random things to keep him busy.  The latest was some grant writing seminar in Drumwright (sp?) that he went to with some other dude that's interested in politics too I guess.  I don't know.  All I know is I get a good meal out of the deal.  Speaking of which, I'm gonna have to cut this short because he's here.

Obviously Death Cab is the one I'm most excited about and the Strokes are probably second, especially since I hear good things about The Eagles of Death Metal and am downloading them as we speak.  I'd also like to go see Rogue Wave and Jackie-O-Motherfucker.  If you haven't heard of Jackie-O, give em a listen, they're pretty good.


Alright, well I'm outta here

Later kids,

"event","Just FYI

The Strokes will be in town March 11th at Cain's Ballroom.  I'm buying tickets tomorrow/today sooooo if you want tickets motherfuckers, call my cell at (918) 691-3739.  They went on sale February 3rd, I don't know how I forgot but I fucking did.  So tomorrow, CALL ME if you wanna go but I'm not quite sure how much they cost.  On line they have some really high prices (like $74 per) which really aren't worth it.  But if it turns out to be less, which I'm sure it will, I'll keep you posted.

Also, another upcoming concert at Cain's:

4/1 Death Cab for Cutie co-headlining tour with Franz Ferdinand.  Tickets can be purchased on 2/7.


I'm positive I'm going to both so if you need me to help you get tickets or just go with you, let me know.  Holy shit, I'm fucking excited.

"event","Oy, I've gone back into my political mode I think... and all it took was a State of the Union address full of false promises and no plans of action... and also a little re-reading of some excerpts from Noam Chomsky's ""Imperial Ambitions: Conversations on the Post-9/11 World"".  Here's a pretty big sample:


<i> In discussion of the bush doctrine: </i>

""Let's turn to the second part of the Bush doctrine: 'Those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves.'* ...Which states harbor them?  Right now there is an extremely important case coming to an appeals court in Miami that bears on this question very directly, the case of the Cuban Five.  I haven't seen much coverage of it.  Just to give you a little background, the United States launched a terrorist war against Cuba in 1959, which picked up rapidly under Kennedy, with Operation Mongoose, and actually came close to triggering a nuclear war.  The peak of the atrocities was probably in the late 1970's.  By that time though, the United States was dissociating itself from the terrorist actions directly.  Instead, the United States was harboring terrorists who were carrying out attacks on Cuba - quite serious ones - in violation of US and international law.  The terrorist attacks, incidentally, continued at least into the late 1990's.  We don't have to debate about whether the people involved are terrorists or not.  The FBI and the Justice Department describe them as dangerous terrorists, so let's take their word for it.  There's Orlando Bosch, for example, whom the FBI accuses of numerous serious terrorist acts, some of them on US soil, and whom the Justice Department described as a threat to the security of the United Steas who should be deported.  Bosch's activities include participation in the destruction of a Cubana airliner, in which seventy-three people were killed, in 1976.  George Bush I, at the request of his son Jeb, the Florida governor, gave Bosch a presidential pardon.*  So he's sitting in Miami, and we're harboring a person whom the Justice Department regards as a dangerous terrorist, a threat to the security of the United States.

""When it became clear that the United States was doing nothing to stop terrorists harbored here from carrying out attacks, Cuba decided to infiltrate the terrorist organizations in Florida with agents of its own to collect information.  Cuba then invited FBI agents to come to Havana, which they did.  In 1998, Cuba provided high-level FBI officials with thousands of pages of documents and videotapes about the planning of terrorist actions in Florida.  And the FBI responded, namely, by arresting the infiltrators.  That's the case of the Cuban Five: the infiltrators who gave the FBI the information about terrorists in the United States were arrested.  They were brought to court in Miami, and the judge refused a change of venue, which is rediculous.  The prosecutor conceded that there was basically no case against the Cubans, but they were convicted anyway.  The case is being appealed, but three of them have life sentences, the others long sentences, and their families have been denied the right to visit them.*

""This is not the only example.  The Venezuelan government is now seeking extradition of two military officers who were accused of participation in bombing attacks in Caracas, fled the country, and now are pleading for political asylum here.*  These officers participated in a military coup in 2002, which succeeded for a couple of days in ousting the Chavez government.  The US governemtn openly supported the coup and, according to quite good journalists in the British press, was involved in instigating it.*  If some military officers in the United States had taken over the White House and run the government, they would have been executed.  But the very reactionary Venezuelan courts, which are still tied to the old regime, refused the government's efforts to try the officers.  The ""totalitarian"" Chavez regime agreed to the court ruling and didn't try them.  So they were set free. Now they are seeking asylum in the United States, and I assume they will receive it.

""Or take Emmanuel Constant.  He is responsible for killing maybe four or five thousand Haitians.  He is living happily in Queens, New York, because the United States refuses even to respond to requests for extradition.*

""So who is harboring terrorists?  If states that harbor terrorists are terrorist states, according to the Bush doctrine, what do we conclude?  We conclude exactly what Kissinger was kind enough to say: such doctrines are unilateral.  They are not intended as norms of international law; they are doctrines that grant the United States the right to use force and violence and to harbor terrorists, but not anyone else.  For the powerful, crimes are those that others commit.""




He doesn't only go off on Bush, trust me.  He rails on Truman, Kennedy, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, and Clinton, as well as others too.  By the way, all of those points he makes above, specifically the ones with the asterisks (*) are all cited in the book itself.  He makes some conjectures, but mostly he deals with facts.  After reading this book it's hard to believe how shitty some human beings are.

"event","I called AAA this morning to unlock my car and immediately I felt like less of an asshole.

Receptionist: ""AAA, how may I help you?""
Me: ""Hi, see I'm a complete idiot and I locked my keys in my car yesterday, so I was wondering if you could send someone over to unlock it for me?""
Receptionist: ""Haha, you're only like the 150th person today, don't worry.  Yeah we'll have someone come over right away I just need your member number...""

I didn't realize this was such a common thing.  I knew my brother had done it before, but that's Parrish, c'mon?  Heh, no offense, man, (he could read this, I'm not sure) but you can be a little absent-minded sometimes.  It's just not a typical ""Drew thing"".  Anyway, the guy came over about thirty minutes after that and litterally it took him 15 seconds to break into my car...  My reactions quickly cycled from awe to appreciation, to excitement, then to concern.  I wonder how many AAA guys have quit there jobs and become professional car thieves?  You know there's gotta be at least one.  Seriously.

Today's my day off so I've decided to run a few errands.  First I'm going to get a new tag for my car.  It's a good thing my mom reminded me because I had completely forgotten.  Then I need to take a TV to my grandpa at his assisted living place so he doesn't have to stare at the wall in his room for entertainment.  Man, I just realized how much I miss him... I need to see him so much more than I do...  Other than that I might mail some stuff or go cash my paycheck at the bank.  I don't know, just whatever I feel like.

I saw this thing in Addie's journal and because I hadn't done one in forever I decided to take it.  So here it is:

"event","I'm a total idiot.

I stayed up until after three and then got up at 7:30 to shower and get cleaned up before work at 8:30.  Originally I was only suppose to work until 2:00, so I figured I could tough it out and be okay.  Turns out my manager has the stomach flu.  I had to cover his shift and stay an extra two and a half hours.  Even though my job is easy, and almost <i>because</i> it's easy and boring and dull and completely mind-numbing at times, I was ready to pass out by the end of the day.  I pulled up in my driveway around 5:00 ready to pass out, but I decided to take in some of the CD's I have lying around in the backseat.  Amid the shuffle I managed to set my keys down without realizing it and lock them securely inside my car.

I'm a total idiot.

It wouldn't even be a problem if I hadn't lost my other set of keys about a month ago.  They're somewhere in my house but your guess is as good as mine as to where.  I guess tomorrow I'm gonna have to call a locksmith or something... I don't know.  I'm so pissed off at myself.

I'm reading a really good book called ""The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green"" by Joshua Braff, the older brother of Zach Braff (ya know, Garden State, Scrubs).  It's about this thirteen year-old Jewish kid growing up New Jersey in the late 70's.  I actually bought it probably nine months ago but never got around to reading it.  I'll let ya know how I rate it when I'm finished.

Other than that I have nothing to report.  Life is quite dull indeed.

So I changed up the look of this journal.  You may ask why Times Square is my background.  Basically it's because I liked the picture and lately I've been reading a lot of books that take place in NYC, sooo it's kind of been on my mind.  I actually like the new layout a lot.

I finished my third book in a week, ""How Soon Is Never?"" by Marc Spitz.  It's a pretty decent read.  I'd give it a 7.5 on a 10 point scale.  Next up is probably ""Running With Scissors"" by Augusten Burroughs.  Although I might pick something else, I'm not sure.  It's good to be in the reading mood again, even though I feel like a total dork.

I ran yesterday for the first time in FOREVER.  I forgot how much easier it is to run when you're listening to music.  It just makes the time go by faster.  Loosens up the mind and doesn't make you constantly think of shit like ""Oh my god, just a little further fatass"" or ""I'm gonna pass out I'm gonna pass out I'm gonna pass out"".  It just makes it so much easier to zone.  It's weird how I want to run in time with the music too.  I picture myself in some music video and the beat is in sync with each stride I take.  I picture the camera panning around me, dramatically watching the sweat drip down my temples as my lips mouth each verse.  I'm such a dork.

This week should be extremely boring.  I'll probably burn through another three books easy.  I'm also gonna try to lay off the sauce and instead use exhaustion as a better method for sleep.  It's weird how I didn't work out any for probably four weeks straight yet I gained 0 poundage.  Sure, I grew a little bit around the belly area, and probably lost some muscle mass, but I'm still 20 pounds under what I weighed four months ago.  I could probably even stand to lose another 10 or 12 and gain about 5 or 6 lb's of muscle.  But the only things that seem to motivate me to do that kind of work would be girls or spite.  And right now I don't want a girl and have used up all my spite to the point that I don't care.  Maybe my insecurity will pitch in and help me get some shit done.  One can only hope!

A week or so ago I joined a pretty cool website that catalogs what I listen to and also shows you similar bands and other good stuff.  Here's a link if you'd like to check out my profile: http://www.last.fm/user/babydontyoucry

And if you would like to join yourself go to www.last.fm and add me as your friend!  So we can be nerds together!  Also, thanks to William Yeh and Drew G. for showing me the site even though it took me 6 months to finally join.

Alright, well I'm out of here to maybe rent a movie since I'm also trying to become more of a movie buff.

Adios

"event","I was reading this book by Dave Eggers, ""You Shall Know Our Velocity!"", and it got me to thinking of everywhere I've been.  City, Sate, Country, whatever.  So, being the dork I am, I made a list.  I didn't put down EVERY city I'd been to - that's impossible - but I put at least the state or country.  So the grand total?

28 states
1 protectorate (Puerto Rico)
9 foreign countries

Some of those countries are pretty wimpy though.  San Marino is just an old City-State landlocked in Italy, and Monaco isn't much bigger than my thumb.  But hey, they count I guess.  I read through my little journal I made that cataloged my whole trip through France and Italy back in highschool.  Maybe I live in the past too much, but it was nice to read and remember the little things that I hope I never forget.  Things I want to keep with me always and forever, even when the names become harder to recall, and the images blurred.  I just want to know the feelings I had then.

Funny thing about the journal is that it's filled with poems and drawings.  I was going through my ""emo"" stage I think.  I'll tell ya though, some of the shit isn't half bad.  Especially the drawings... I wish I still drew.

So I've started packing my things.  Books are going first, then CD's, then random stuff.  I'm doing it all organized and shit too, or I'm trying to anyway, labeling as I go and all that jazz.  I'm gonna miss this house a lot... 14 years is a long time. 

And I shall leave you with a Drew original, written in Venice on January 18, 2003:


<i>
Push me along the waterside,
through darkness I will find my way
Stumble along narrow roads,
through the cold I will never stray

Soft pink lights illuminate the evergreen,
as it sways and peaks and ebbs and flows
I will wander through the dampened streets,
until I may hold you close

And I can see the yellow moon standing in a starless sky
And wonder what it is you can see in a distant night
</i>

"event","After only close to four weeks, Maddie and I broke up.  I just can't be in a relationship right now... It's too much for me to handle and I don't want it. Not now.  It took me a while to realize that but I finally did, and I guess have to do what feels right, and right now that's being alone.

I realize my last post was pretty cryptic but there was a bunch of drama behind it and I think, maybe, it's all okay now.  

I feel like crap all of a sudden, so I'm cuttin this post a little short.  Maybe more news later?

Oh, and yes ""Sidewalk Serfer Girl"" is spelled with an E, I think because it could be in reference to serfs?  Or maybe just cause they're welsh?  I don't know, but I'm not an idiot.  I know how to spell surfer.

"event","Tequila and ice with a lime is underated.  At first there's a little burning, but with good Tequila it'll go down smooth and leave a pleasant after taste.  It's not too strong like vodka, not as dark as whiskey, just smooth and easy.  That's the way I wish everything was.  Smooth and easy...

I've been reading a lot lately, mostly novels or light biographies.  You'd think working in a bookstore I'd be able to find an abundance of must-reads but that's not altogether true.  First of all, I work in music, so the only reading I do is either of liner notes or the latest music mag.  And the only decent ones are published bi-monthly, six issues a year.  What kind of shit is that?  I guess quality not quantity, eh?  And the booksellers are no help.  I ask for recommendations all the time, only to hear titles of ""Blue Like Jazz"" and other similar pieces of shit.  I often wonder how people have such terrible tastes.  How can they enjoy such shit?  Why are there fans of Simple Plan and Good Charlotte?  How do their eardrums not explode and their brains not collapse in on themselves?  And these aren't just the emo pre-16 crowd, there are assholes my age out there that love this shit.  I've seen it, they exist.  The rare instance that someone shows intelligence and buys something I like, I look them over, check them carefully.  Looking for the imposter that lies beneathe, the psuedo intellectual, the ""indie"" phony dying to fit in with his/her friends.  I'm always skeptical.

I know few genuine individuals out there, and if I don't KNOW you, then as far as I can tell, you aren't.  And even when I do... I'm not so sure.  But I bite my tongue.  I act polite.  Give them a compliment or two, maybe even a recommendation, see if they know what they're talking about.  Watch their reaction.  With girls I'm more forgiving than with guys.  And usually it is girls that know less about good taste in music or books or whatever.  I'm not a male chauvinist and definitely not a masochist, it's just that in my experiences this rings true.  But with girls it's almost cute and fun to show them something they really enjoy.  It gives me a sense of pride or accomplishment I guess, I don't know; however fleeting the feeling is though, I enjoy it.  Maybe that's why I rarely date anyone that already likes the same things as me.  Cause I get such a kick out of being the one that ""knows more"" about certain things.  I mean, these are my things, not theirs.  This is my realm.  If you know almost as much and I'm dating you, then it's almost threatening.  Like, what else do I have to offer?  I'm just like anyone else after that right?  I'm just another face in the crowd, no different.  Nothing new to offer...  And i'm not asking for every girl I meet to be ""impressed"" by my knowledge.  I don't need recognition, but in my little pea brain I do need to know I'm good at something, better even.  Can you deny that you don't need to have something too?

These few things I know, this is what I can bring to the table.  This is what I have to dish out in a relationship.  Of course I have love and affection and I'll be there for you whenever you want, but everyone has that I think.  Somewhere, deep down, everyone has that...  Actually, I don't know if I even have that anymore.  It's not easy for me to let someone inside... not anymore.  It's still too soon and scary, no terrifying.  So there ya go, Rachel, you're still in my life through my own fear.  That's all that's left of you though, I can guarantee you that.

"event","I fixed my computer.  It's been busted since probably August of last year (I got it in June), and finally after all this time I fixed it.  It only took me deleting my entire hard drive and doing a system recovery.  Apparently it wasn't a hardware problem after all, just some windows update or something fucked up my CD/DVD drive.  I was able to transfer most of my files onto my ipod before I deleted everything.  So yeah, this is my first entry from my actual computer in a long long time.

I originally had a journal entry posted from I think Saturday.  All it talked about was a conversation I had with someone online, and I had copied the full text along with my own commentary.  But after having it up for only five minutes, I deleted it.  I don't want to inflame an already fucked up situation, but I still don't think I'd be in the wrong if I showed it to everyone.  Maybe it's just best to forgive and forget though... I just wish everything and everyone was back to normal.  I hate losing friendships...

This week has gone well, I hung out with almost all of my close guy friends a few times, kind of a last goodbye before they all go back to school for the spring.  Eh... time to be lonely again... except this time I have a girlfriend that really cares about me, something I haven't had in a while and it feels pretty nice.  Things probably won't be so bad this time around.

In my free time I've been loading my CD's onto my ipod hardcore like, along with downloading quite a few tracks off of Soulseek, something I've been wanting to do for months but couldn't since it was my mom's computer.  I'll never know how much music I lost because of my downloading hiatus!

Tonight I'm free to do whatever, but so far my plans are nil.  And I really don't feel like organizing things this time... we'll see what happens.

I work til 9:30 tomorrow night and close on Saturday, so yet again I don't have much of a weekend.

Catch you guys later

"event","Tuesday I bought the new strokes album and the only way I can describe it is ""dissapointing"".  I don't know what I was expecting.  I had heard the single ""Juice Box"" and hated it.  The few other tracks I got a sneek peak of were okay but altogether pretty forgetable... I don't know.  I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised and I wasn't.  But I'll still give it a few more listens and see if it grows on me.

Oh my God, I hate the phone here.  It rings so much and drives me nuts.  I'd answer it, but it's never for me anyway.  And when I get it for someone else they usually aren't home so I take a message that I forget to give to whoever they were trying to get a hold of.  So I just don't answer and I let it ring. Ring ring ring.  It kills me.

I also bought Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's CD finally.  I ordered it a few weeks ago and it came in yesterday and it's muy bien.  It slightly makes up for the Strokes sucking but still I miss my strokage.

I think I've hung out with Maddie like four or five times in the past week and things are still going really well.  I'm not even scared or nervous or anything I thought I would be.  I actually trust her a lot because she's such a great girl.  I guess I never thought I'd find someone that I enjoy being with so much so soon, but I did and things are working out.

But

School...  I didn't want to enroll in TCC this semester just because I'm so nervous about fucking things up again and I don't know if I'm ready yet... So I think I'm gonna try and get another job and earn some extra cash, maybe save up for trip overseas or something later on.  Come April I plan on re-evaluating where I am, what I'm doing and make a decision about what's next for me.  I'm not so worried about rushing to finish school.  Yeah, it'd be nice to graduate on time but I don't think that will determine my future happiness or success.  I'm gonna try and take my time, do things right, my way.  I think that's best for me now.

Here's my schedule for the weekend:

Fri - 5:00 to 10:00
Sat - 4:00 to 11:30 (Close)
Sun - 2:00 to 9:30 (Close)

No weekend fun for me, but that's okay I guess.

So we're moving.  I know I've said we were moving before in the past, but this time my parents and the buyer have signed a contract and we gotta vacate by March 1st.  I might be getting an apartment, but my living arrangements for the next year or so are definitely in limbo.  I'm gonna start preparing for the move by cataloguing my CD's and books and things, something I haven't done before and desperately need/want to do.  I think my album collection has recently swelled into the 210's or somewhere around there.  And yes, I am quite proud of it.

Catch you all later

I don't remember much of New Year's.  Like, I can't really recall anything from 9:00 pm on, but I do know I didn't throw up so I consider the night a success.  

Maddie couldn't go with me because she had work in the morning on the 1st, so I hitched a ride with Drew and Trip.  We got there at 5:00 and decided we had to do a lot of catching up with everyone else, who were still hung over from the night before.  So yeah, after 4 hours straight of drinking I got quite drunk.  I was told the next day that I had tried to make white russians (because they fucking rock) with this girl's vodka she let me borrow and Kahlua but that I couldn't find any milk so I just poured more vodka in to take the edge off instead.  I can't believe I drank that, talk about burning.

On New Year's day, which was fucking gorgeous by the way, I got lunch for Maddie and just hung out at my house the whole day, took it easy.  Watched some football with my brother, nothing special.

Yesterday, Parrish went back to Chi-town.  I think the next time I'll see him is like Spring Break or something.  Maddie was sick all day, so I went over to her house and watched a movie with her and just hung out for a while.  I met her family, which was slightly awkward but they seem very nice and I think they liked me.  Then I went back home to watch the end of the Sugar Bowl with Charlie and Andy.

And today I have work from 4 til close, so like 11:30ish.  Tomorrow is the Rose Bowl, and we're all watching it at Nate's cause he has a HD projection screen which is amazing.  I'm taking Maddie to meet all the guys, so I hope everything goes well.  

See ya later kids

I'm going to a party my friends are having at the Rooney's cabins on the Illinois River for New Year's.  Brian and Chris organized the whole thing and I think they're estimating about 30 to 40 people to show up.  I think most everyone is already there, but I decided to come down tomorrow (today) instead.  I'm gonna be taking Maddie with me and hopefully she won't feel out of place and stuff.

Oh, yeah, by the way, I really really like Maddie a lot.  It's weird because we've only been out a few times but I feel like I've known her a lot longer.  She's amazing.

Things really couldn't be better now, and I can't believe it.  I feel great, works going okay, I'm seeing my friends a lot, and everything is going extremely well.

So I won't be back in town until New Year's Day sometime.  Hope everybody has a happy new year, be safe kids!

I hope everybody had a great Christmas, I know mine was much better than I expected it to be.  Christmas Eve I got to work at 11:00 and the managers decided to close the store an hour early, around 6:00.  I got home at about 6:30 and crashed.  Passed out in my bed for a good two hours.  When I woke up my family had arrived for dinner, beef tenderloin and other stuff, and it was great.  I got to see my little second cousins (basically they're like my neice and nephew) and they are adorable.  Eloise is the oldest one and she's just over two years-old, but quite the conversationalist.  She was asking everybody where I was when I was asleep upstairs.  She's a cutie.  And Oliver, who's just over a year, is quite cute as well.  He's real chubby with blonde hair.  Cute kids.  I also got to see my Grandpa which was nice but he didn't have the best day.  He had trouble remember names and places, but he seemed to enjoy himself.

On Christmas I pretty much go everything I wanted and then some.  Lots of CD's, some nice pants and collared shirts from my Mom and Price.  Some cash and speakers for my computer from my Dad and Patti.  I <3 my family.

I've got a really bad cold right now that's been keeping me up late at night.  It could be allergies but I'm not sure.  But anyway, I didn't fall asleep until 5:30 the night after Christmas, and then I had to be at work at 10:00 AM for the day after Christmas.  Needless to say, my day was terrible.  I worked until about 6:30, and we were pretty consistantly busy the whole day.  Lots of returns, lots of gift cards being used and all that jazz.  I don't understand the gift card usage though.  I mean, it usually takes me a while to enjoy all the stuff I get for Christmas before I start moving on to gift cards.  But even if that's all I had gotten I would wait until at least a week after Christmas to let the stores restock all the good stuff they sold out of.  It's a waste to get stuff you don't really want.

After I got home I crashed.  I had planned on hanging out with Nate and Jonathan and maybe some other people but I just couldn't make it.  Hopefully they ain't pissed.  Today I'm going to OKC to see my Dad.  Actually in the next forty-five minutes I'm gonna be heading out with my brother.  He got to see him on Christmas, I didn't.  So I have to give him and Patti their gifts still.  I gave them decent stuff me thinks, me hopes.

Ok, so that's it for me.  I'll be back in town tonight around 9:00 most likely.  I'll try to call some of the boys to hang out since I won't be exhausted.  I have work tomorrow from 8:30 to 4:30 though.

See ya guys later

Good morning to me.

I'm up early today, at the ass-crack of dawn, because I've got a pretty busy day.  First of all, I don't have to work today/tonight because this other guy, Michael, is gonna fill in my shift.  He's only here for the holidays so that's why he wasn't on the original schedule.  And because I worked yesterday from 8:30 to 4:30 I canceled the date I had pushed back to last night, to tonight.  We both aren't working, so neither of us should be too tired, and hopefully it'll be a lot of fun.  But I'm up this early because I've GOT to finish my Christmas shopping today, in one fell swoop.  Hopefully I'll be able to do it, but cross your fingers.  I have a list of people and stuff I need to get, so I'm pretty set.

This morning I'm going to put the final seal on my relationship with Rachel by giving her back her key to her house.  Yes, we both had each other's house keys.  And no, it wasn't that weird.  We saw each other like every other day for two years, so it got kind of annoying having to answer the door whenever we went to each other's houses.  I've written a little note in the envelope for the Wilkerson's asking them to give the key back to her.  Here's to hoping I don't run into her or anyone else I reeeeaaaalllly don't want to see!

I have a few other errands I'm gonna be running here and there as well.

Oh, I think I'm not going to drink again at least until New Year's.  I've gotten pretty drunk a couple of times in the past week, and I'm worried I'm startin' to maybe pack back on a few pounds.  That's another thing I have to do today is run.  Run a lot.  Also after Christmas I think I'm gonna go back to my trainer guy, Cecil, and see if I can start that up again.

Ok, kids, I'm off shoppin!  Catch you all later!

"event","Alright, so I have a date Wednesday night with this really pretty girl I work with.  I don't know her all that well, but she seems really sweet and cool, so we'll see how things work out.  She has to work until 8:00 and then we're either going to see Walk the Line (because we're both losers and haven't seen it yet) or we're going to Rema to see their huge Christmas light thing.  Maybe we'll do both, but I'm not sure if we'll have time to.

In other news I got quite drunk the other night, drunk dialed several people, and woke up with the worst hangover I've ever experienced.  No throwing up or other embarassing incidents occured however, so I consider the night a success.


Work schedule for the rest of the week (I think):

Tuesday 12/20 - 4:00 to Close (probably get out at about 11:30)

Thursday 12/22 - 8:30 to 4:30

Friday 12/23 - 4:00 to Close (probably 11:30 again)

Saturday 12/24 - 11:00 to Close (probably 7:15ish since it's Xmas Eve)

Sunday 12/25 - CHRISTMAS!!!


Sucks I have to work this saturday, but oh well, I'll make it just fine.  If anybody gets into to town and wants to hang out (preferably on a day I don't work) give me a call.  I still don't have everyone's cell number in my phone, sooo it makes it easier if you guys call me.

Next week I think I work more than anyone else in my department, something close to 40 hours, which really isn't that much.  But all my friends will be getting in around that time, so I can't really hang out with them much, which is a drag.

My folks went to New York this morning around 6:00 AM, so I have the house pretty much to myself for the weekend.  I might have some people over Saturday night if I can, we'll see how everything works out.

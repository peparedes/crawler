"event","So, my baby sister is turning 17 tomorrow. 
OMG does that make me feel old. 

Yeah, I'm only 23 but by this age my mom had already had two kids and had been married for about 6 years. I, thank god, have no children and am not yet married. Not that I don't want to get married, and maybe after a few bottles of wine and pills, have kids as well. I've just been thinking really hard about what I thought I'd be doing at this age.. and I haven't done a single one of them.

When I was a wee high schooler, I wanted to be either have a degree in history of some kind, or to own my own little cafe. Did I apply myself to either one of those dreams? Nope. Well, okay, I kinda did if you count working in a cafe for like 3.5 years after I graduated. If not, well, then I've been slacking something fierce. And I know it's up to me to man up and see what I need to apply to a school of some sort so that I might possibly learn something that will keep me fed and in a resemblance of happiness. But it's hard. I don't wanna stress myself over taking out loans, that I know won't be approved given the state of our economy, and I don't want to stress over taking any sort of tests to see just how much I've forgotten in the last 6 years since I graduated.

Blah. 

Why can't my faery godmother show up, wave her wand, and make me a responsible adult with a good paying job that lets me have some sort of pride in myself? 

Where the fuck are you, faery godmother?!"

<lj-cut text=""Cut for being Emotional"">

I really don't know what's wrong with me lately. I seems like every time I get things up and running smoothly, the evil inside of me just oozes out, ruining all of my hard work. I hate how this always happens to me.

This isn't meant to be a ""poor pitiful Amanda"" post, so I'm sorry if it's coming off that way. I don't want it to be that way, anyway.

Why is it that I just cannot communicate my feelings with people that care about me and I them? I will tell myself that it can't hurt me and that it will make things go better.. and then I just sit there, staring at the wall or out the window or away while he talks to me? I know how it must look, me not paying any attention, but I am. I am listening to every word and letting it sink in, letting the words bounce around my head. And then I <i>think</i> of what I should say.. and then I think of what he <i>might</i> say.. and then I'm afraid to say anything at all for fear that it'll be the wrong thing and then.. then we'll be over.

And then it goes downhill from there, all because I'm afraid of sharing how I feel about a situation. 

*sigh*

That doesn't count the times that I misunderstand something or the times that I say things that I don't even remember saying five minutes later. That's something that has worried me, the forgetting. Earlier in the week, we had a fight.. and then I said something and went to take a shower. While I was in the shower, I was trying to go over everything that we had said to each other, and I couldn't remember what I had just said. And I almost panicked, thinking that maybe I had said something really horrible or flippant. It makes me want to carry around a tape recorder, so that I know just how I'm saying things to other people. Are all of my conversations sarcastic and mean? I don't know, and it makes me worry that one day I'm going to lose my friends over it.

I just really wish that I know how to <i>talk</i>. to people, to trust them. I'm tired of feeling so fucking lonely and sad. God, I can't even write this without starting to cry. What's wrong with me?

"event","So, last week we bought a 360. <br /><br />In the last week I have checked out more games from work and bought more things from work than the rest of the time I've worked there. We're talking almost a year and&nbsp; half of working at this place and now I'm spending money and taking advantage of free games. We checked out:&nbsp;Gears of War, Army of Two, Halo 3, Eternal Sonata (for me and there<em> is</em> a story behind this), and Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter. Joe checked out GTA 4 from the video store, and is currently very thrilled with the idea of hijacking people at gunpoint and then going to the strip club.<br /><br />Scott's mom sent some of his stuff, plus Rock Band and GH2. It arrived yesterday evening and then we went to my store&nbsp;to buy a&nbsp;mike and new guitars. Yayers. Home&nbsp;again, we put everything&nbsp;together, only one of the guitars won't sink up. Damn. Guess&nbsp;who had to sing.&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent most of the night playing Rock Band, as our band The&nbsp;Vagoos,&nbsp;until Joe's dad told us to quiet down. The drums are fucking loud. <br /><br />I returned the wireless guitar today after work for a wired one. We will be hindered in our rawkin owt! but we will be spending less money on batteries. <br />Fucking batteries.<br /><br /><br />So, the Eternal Sonata story:<br /><br />I like cute stuff. I really like cute stuff, it's no lie. So, in the FPS, blowshitupwooooo!!!11-rich system that is the 360, there are very few cute games. Here's a few:&nbsp;ES, Beautiful Katamari, Culdcept Saga, Viva Pinata. That's all I can think of. And we didn't have any of the others. Only the ES. So, I check it out. I get home, put it in, watch the 15 minutes of cinema that confused the fuck out of me, and then I get to run around as Polka, a blonde chick with fucked up hair, but she FIGHTS WITH A FUCKING PARASOL! ( XD ) Oh, and did I&nbsp;mention that she gets to loot chests and stuff and one of the items are peach cookies?&nbsp;Oh dear god the peach cookies. When I read the discription for it, I said &quot;Peach Cookies!&quot; in a very manly way, since it heals 1000 HP. And that is fucking awesome.<br /><br />So, I play for a bit as her.. and then suddenly, I'm playing as two boys from a town that Polka visted. And I have no idea where I'm supposed to go. So, in typical RPG style, I run into every building, waiting for a cinema scene. Not too much longer, I get my cinema scene in a sewer. A sewer full of little rats with glowy orbs at the tips of their tails. So, I run around the sewer, dodging rats when I&nbsp;can and fighting them when I can't. Allegretto is the typical sword dude and he has a little sidekick named Beat that likes shooting things. Oh, and is useless half of the time because he wants to take pictures instead of shoot out the eyes of the little rats. Eventually, after leveling twice, I find a lever and pull it and then go down a hall. Where I&nbsp;have to fight two little rats and THE BIGGEST FUCKING RATTHING I'VE EVER SEEN. <br /><br />I die after about two minutes because there is no guide in my game to tell me how to get to the equip screen. So, even though I'm level three now, I'm still wearing the normal clothes that I started with, instead of the chain shirts I&nbsp;have been finding like mad. So, I die. And have to find my way back to the sewer because I didn't save once I got there. But I'm smart, I'm gonna go buy things first. So I do, and twenty minutes later I&nbsp;save before going to fight the ratthing again. Once more, I die. So I'm pissed by this point because what's the point of buying things if they don't equip?! After much buttonsmashing and Scott telling me how to do things, I find the equip screen and put chaing shirts on my boys and give them somemore PEACHCOOKIES. I&nbsp;fight the rat, I win. Yay! <br /><br />Wait.. why are there credits running..? I thought this was an ARE PEE GEE. Skip. Enter cinema scene.. Hey, that's Polka! And some weird guy in a top hat. And&nbsp;she wants to show him something in the forest. Which forest, I don't&nbsp;know. So after running to&nbsp;the forest I&nbsp;remember from the beginning, I learn&nbsp;I cannot leave the town&nbsp;because it is dangerous in the forest. WTF man. Well, let's see... um, there's a path, let's follow it!&nbsp;So I do, and lo and behold, there is a forest that is considered safe. Is it safe because there are big flappy birds in armor that kill you? Must be. So I die.<br /><br /><strong>AND END UP IN THE FUCKING DUNGEON BEFORE&nbsp;THE RAT FIGHT</strong>.<br /><br />I quit playing. I'd played for about an hour and a half.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, that's my review of Eternal Sonata. It's pretty. But you have to save every five seconds because if you don't, you'll have to play the game five times over before you get someplace new in the game."

"event","Sitting here in the WI Library while Uncle Daniel checks his e-mail. He asked if I could drive him by, so I did so that I could find a book.. but, sadly, they don't have a single one. Blast and double blast. I guess I'll have to look at Books a Million or Walden Books, cos we don't have it at BN (it's an old book.)Oh well.

Might go to to the show tonight at the Jinx, but I'm not sure; I have work at 9AM and I can't be late like I was this morning. :sigh: Sucks when you put your alarm on PM instead of AM and then you're late for work and only get to work 3 1/2 hours. Much sucking. Almost as much as your mom did last night. Ohh. 

Well, I've been on this computer for longer than the alloted 30 mins. I think I'll go find a book to copy pictures out of, hehe. Pretty Celtic Tree Pictures, to be exact.



Bye now."

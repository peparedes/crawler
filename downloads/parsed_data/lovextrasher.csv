"event","The breakfast was pretty nice. I should have gotten the pancakes though instead of the french toast. Egh. Didn't taste great. But it was okay. Now I'm making myself hungry. Probably you too. But I have lunch next period. So HAHA :P

Yea...I got to wear my pink J.Lo skirt. It's so cute lol. Joe said I look like a preppy cheerleader. Bad. But...w/e. This entry might be short because I really have nothing to say. I have a test on social studies after lunch, and after that my English test. Ugh. I'm probably going to fail both lol. Here is something fun:

1. Go to your lj calander.
2. Find your 15th entry.
3. Copy and paste the 5th sentence (if you do not have 5 sentences take the 4th one, etc.)
4. Put this in your lj along with the sentence and date of the entry.

December 20th (also during computer class...like right now).

Anyways, tomorrow will be Anti-Valentine's day. My own holiday. Today I wore blue. So tomorrow I will dress in all pink and red. Will be kind of akward, since I usually don't wear ALL pink and red. And...it will be the day after Valentine's day. HAHA. I'm such a dork. Hmph.

Nothing is really happening in school...and that's bad because that means there is nothing to talk about in my rad lj. I think Nikki is abandoning her lj though. It seems she's posting more, and more interesting posts too, in a Xanga. Traitor.

I can't wait to get on the freaking saws already in technology class. I'm tired of these stupid car sketches *throws on the floor and makes a fit*. My co2 car is probably going to lose. I am putting absolutley no effort into this project. I will love you forever if you could sketch a very aerodynamic and winning dragster (co2 car) for me :D.

"event","This kid had a seisure (sp?) in my last period class. =O . It was so scary. It lasted like 5-10 seconds but like two people thought he faked it? I doubt it. He just fell back onto this girl and she was saying get off me and he then fell on the floor and was shaking and stuff. I thought it was Jason at first because the kid was in a gray sweatshirt and Jason often wears gray sweatshirts. So I thought Jason was making some kind of joke or something. ""It's like the week of hell or something""-Jason. lol. *sigh* I hope he's okay now.

Enough about that. It's making me sad.

"event","Joe (Ali's boyfriend) picked a fight with Jason right after 7th period. I got fucking scared because I was right behind Jason and Joe popped out of no where and started punching Jason. So yea, I sorta had a front row view of the fight? Jason was slammed right into the lockers. I don't think he even tried to hit him back =\. Then they got broken up. 

So then I asked Ali why the hell did he start fighting with him. She kept just laughing and stuff about how that was the best so I don't know if she still wants to be friends with me since I'm a friend of Jason's? But then she answered me and it was something about Jason sexually harrasing her for the past two years????? Joe wasn't even her boyfriend for two years. Then I heard that the whole fight was planned in art (like 6th period or w/e. I don't have it but Ali and Joe do). 

So yea, that's my highlight of the day."

The only really interesting elective on this sheet is Digital Photography (we also get to work with Adobe Photoshop ^.^). So that's definetley going number 1.

I have this really awesome picture i wanted to post but unfortunatley I'm in school. Lunch next and I forgot my money again. Actually, I have the money...but in coins. lmao. One time me and Nikki went to Pacsun and I was trying to find enough to buy this roxy wallet [<3]. So I was taking out all these coins and Nikki said I looked like an old grandma buying groceries rofl.

I could go on and on typing but I don't know what about. 

Amanda-thanks for cheering me up.
Jason-which list am I on? lol. Mwahahaha I know everything. And I'm not sod of Antarctica. I'm co-president :-P.

"event","My day started with ANOTHER test of my hearing at the nurses office. This time ""my hearing was better"". Pshh always was good and always will :-P lol.

I was so happy today because I got good scores on my midterms. 99% in science (highest in all of my teachers classes), 87% in math  , 94% in social studies, and 97% in spanish. So I was pretty happy with myself. But then I realized I forgot to bring In my yearbook money. It was due today, but you could bring it in later. Except if you brought the money in by today you would have a few extras in your yearbook and you pay $5 dollars less(I know what you are thinking, big whoop lol). But as the worrywart I am, I got so mad and worried at myself. And the teacher who was in charge of the yearbooks was so mean! She wouldn't even let me leave a deposit with my name  All she said is that I need it by 1:30 PM, and it was almost 1. So I had to call my mom who wasn't home anyway, and she said for me to ask a teacher. psh. Wouldn't it look weird, a teacher giving me $30? But I asked my math/homeroom teacher, and she lent me it. So I had it handed in on time. You all probably think it's not a big deal, but don't you want your name imprinted in gold foil on the cover?? I do! lol  Right after I got this huge headache. And I still have it. *sigh* I lose my sense sometimes... lol"

I always wait on my porch for the bus, and when I finally saw the bus (almost 8 am, homeroom starts at 8:07) I walked to the stop and I couldn't feel my legs! lol.

We were studying about the working conditions in the late 1800's  and early 1900's in the U.S. So we learned that a lot of people were complaining about the working conditions. Then I remembered that quote and wrote it down on the back cover of my social studies notebook (me, Amanda, and Ali have this little convo thing going on that cover).

I was passing it back and forth with Amanda and once the teacher told us to do out group assignment and everyone started talking she came to our group and picked up the notebook. LMAO. She looked so funny because nothing bad was written there except the word ""assed"". It was all just funny convo's. So after glancing at it she put it down and told us to pay attention a little more. One legged bitch. I'm multi tasked!lol. Seriously...I was paying attention.

Well, that's the highlight of my day. Talk to all you fellas later."

Sorry. I had to let my anger out.

Amanda told us an interesting story today. Her brother saw our science teacher with some gay asian dude in a chinese restauarant. Then Bridget said she saw him with the same guy in this big supermarket... King Kullen. It's a stupid name. Now we are wondering if he's gay.

In Tech, Mr.Pupke took advantage of our big class and made us sand out the writings on the desks. With sandpaper. It smelled like fish. I don't think he ever heard of cleaners such as Pinesol. No, I doubt it. Then in Social Studies Amanda started this convo on the back of my notebook, and out came my new years resolution. Fill the cover up by June.

I have a Spanish quiz tomorrow. And Friday. Ew. Then next week is the ELA 8th grade test. Our english teacher killed us preparing for it. The week after that are midterms. Bleah. But we only have to go to school in the morning for 2-3 days to take a midterm or two each day and then we get to go home. YaY.

This might give a laugh: I went to CVS, and in the parking lot I saw a car with this liscense plate: ""OH MR B"".

When we were on line in the deli, there were these boxes of chocolates like...to the left of the line. This little girl had one of those tiny barbie dolls they give out in mcdonalds with a happy meal. So she started building like... a house for it with the chocolate boxes. Each time the line moved up she had to put the boxes back and start a new one.

When we got back home we played some Monopoly, New York City Edition (Hollerz lol). I was beating her but it was like 12 am and we decided to go to sleep. Then she kept talking crap how we should apologise to the Braindead Gang for all the pranks we played on them. I knew she was joking.

In the morning we continued our monopoly game. She beat my ass. :-( In the end she won by like 6,000. We spent the rest of the day playing board games and making prank phone calls! LOL. Her mom was going to drive us somewhere but she wasn't feeling well :-(.

"event","Today was kind of boring, but in most of my classes, half the kids were gone on a field trip so we didn't get a lot of work. In Tech, Jason got thrown out of class because he was laughing, so until he came back, me and Amanda actually got some work done on our bridge drawing. In social studies, my group is already done with our project, so me and Bridget just went on the computer.

Afterschool I walked home with Jason and Amanda, and it was pretty far for me and Jason. And of course, right when we left the school I need to go pee. When I got home I barged into the bathroom. :-) And that was my wonderful day. Goodbye."

"event","FRIDAY WAS THE SHIZ. Nikki came over and it was the craziest day ever. We went out for a walk around the block with my dog, and when we were walking down back my street again, I started telling Nikki a story and got distracted. Suddenly she yells at me to get out of the way and there is this car stopped right in front of me and I jump out of the way with my dog. The guy in the car (guy=SMOKIN hot) was laughing his head off. Then later when we went for pizza, we ate at the pizzeria and then got some ice cream(i got a strawberry shortcake). And we were walking home and this group of *slightly* hot guys walk past us and one of them says to me ""Can I have a piece of that strawberry shortcake?"". LOL. We just walked on.

Then when we went walking around again Nikki found tape from a video cassette and she started dragging it a long with her. rofl. It was the funniest thing ever. And it started getting dark out and we walked past this house where a group of kids where playing in the front yard, and they started cursing at us and stalking us. So when we walked past their house again they called their DAD over and told on us. So damn straight I straightened it out with him. :-P

That was an awesome day. Today was an OK-AY day. Funniest thing was in English when our teacher was asking for an example where we can get a literal defenition and a figurative defention, so I said ""I get so much homework I could die doing it"". And Jason said the it's true, we could die from homework, because if you don't have blood clots and you get a paper cut, you can bleed to death. Then in Spanish we played with telephones."

Having a job and no real bills to pay makes shopping so fun.<p>Anyway, my apologies go to Crystal for Jay, My Puppy, and My own abrupt departure last night.  Nothing personal.  I think you know why we left, and it wasn't you darling."

On a lighter note, I am at the golden rhino stage in Jet Grind Radio.<P>""I'm not a genie in a bottle, I'm a tramp in a lamp.""-Jay last night, resulting in a Kelly B giggly fit."

"event","Yesterday was a day from hell.  Princess Lyndsey didn't show up for her shift, resulting in me covering her shift on top of mine.  Also resulting in only two people handling the lunch rush.  I want to punch her, she even called and said ""I'm on my way.""  I had to cover her shift wednsday too, on my day off.  Not only that, but the food truck came at the worst possible time.  Therefore, I had no help handling the customers that were forming lines out the door and bitching because they didnt want olives on their sandwich.  Fuck you Lyndsey.<p>Time for more bitching.<p>I have an eye exam today.  This is very bad.  I already know my eyes have deteriorated rapidly from long hours staring at a computer screen.  Well, maybe I can get some funky contacts out of the deal.  Make my eyes less brown and more green :).<p>Off to sandwich making."

"event","Very strange last night.  I was in my pig pajama pants and eating graham crackers and milk, watching ""The Weakest Link"".  (I was rooting for Chris, the computer nerd.) haven't felt that content in a long time.  This year , as in the upcoming school year, looks promising.  Last year, sophomore year, was ""a demon hellride.""  Lets leave it at that."

"event","I have a day off.  Initially, I was planning to get some stuff done or go enjoy myself at the mall.  But, then I decided that loafing in my pajamas would be more reasonable.  Anyways, payday is Wednsday.  Thats a good day to go spend the dough.  I hope I don't have to work that day.  Blah.<P>Michelle already brought home another kitty.  Lola is trying to mommy the kitty and give him baths, but the kitty isn't having it.  I had a dream about Garfield, the deceased kitty a few nights ago.  I dreamt I found her alive and her death was a big misunderstanding.  Ah!<p>School starts soon, which is making me heartsick.  I have to start summer reading, and buy new school clothes and supplies.  I dread the summer reading part, the load is alot larger for me.  Damn the advanced classes.  Uh oh, I'm gloating.<p>My body is very tired.  I may take a nap and go to the mall, all this thinking about my summer dwindling away makes me feel like something has to be accomplished.  Damn."

I think I'll surprise her and bring some kitties home for her.  She wants two.<p>I have to go to work at 11.  I also came to a conclusion: David Bowie is a lunatic."

"event","Hmm...Haven't written in a bit.  Wednsday I went to the mall with ""the boy"", good fun except for the fact that I could not walk very well.  Lola had chewed through my sandals , which wouldn't have been a big deal if I had another pair at my moms.  So, I marched around looking for a gift for my mommy with my sandals held together with a pin.  Thursday was my mommy's birthday so I took her to breakfast and gave her disgustingly expensive perfume.  Then I went home and she went to Foxwoods, and when I came home Friday morning there was a wonderful surprise on the table.  I guess she won some money, because there was a nice crisp 20 on the table.  Rock out.  Today I'm going to be at my dads, so all I'm going to do all day is play Jet Grind Radio.  But first I must report to sandwich slavery."

"event","Sudden bout of panic, today is July 24.  Mothers birthday is July 26! Must cash paycheck and get her a gift.  I was thinking of something elaborate, but I have a brain fart.  Last year I got her a 75 dollar gift certificate to a spa, she only used half of it so far.  It took some thinking to come up with that too.  I'll be plain and get her some more Angel perfume, pratical and insanely expensive.  She said she was running out.  Ugh, I hate birthdays.  Unless its mine of course :).<p> Patiently waiting for Jay to arrive from his grandma's house.  I'm bored, and all I can hear is my mom and her friends engaged in a rowdy game of cards.  I want to play Jet Grind Radio too."

"event","We sold our house, and this inspector guy is coming over to tap on our walls to make sure there is no nests of giant rat families living in our walls.  This means I just had to finish cleaning my room...yuck.  I hope Tai, my rat that escaped from its cage, isn't mysteriously found.  That rat was huge, it ate the other rat Kobe.  After it ate Kobe, it escaped from the cage that had a ten pound coil on top of it.  Tai = mega rat.<p>I am so tired, that I will drop.  Lola is seeking attention too, so I have to rub her belly and take her for a W-A-L-K before I hit the pillow for a couple hours.  Gotta wait for Jay to come over, so this is perfect timing for a nappy-poo.  I need a shower too, I smell like a ham sandwich.  Damn Subway."

Yay, no work today!  I want to go shopping, but I can't deplete the money in my account.  I need that for a car.  I want puma slides really bad too, they are ugly and comfy.  Next paycheck?  So I give the middle finger today to my feeble bank account, and I think I'll mill around Waterfire tonite.  Shit, I don't even know if there is one tonite.  I need to manage to have fun with only 13 bucks.<P>
I'm out again, more later?"

"event","Memememe.  I'm hopping on the current livejournal.com bandwagon, I felt left out.  I also feel like an attention glutton now.  Hurray for Self-Glorification!  I really am not sure why I'm starting one, I guess it will give me stuff to do at 4 in the morn waiting for my downloads to complete.  Hmm, and my stalkers can stop hiding in my bushes to figure out my daily activities.  I don't think the last reason is a plus...yeep!  Anyway, I'll stop babbling and give the stalkers some substance!<P>
Jay just had a Ramen noodle remnant hanging off his cheek, aww.  He just ran upstairs to play some zombie game and let me finish this thingie.  Lola is thumping her tail on the floor.   Lola is a cute little Pitbull I brought home from the pound last week, hence the name username Lola Ebola.  I like the ebola part, its a funny word.  I'll talk about Lola many times in this thingie, she's like my child.  I'm her favorite, she sleeps in my bed even when I'm not home to fall asleep and watch Battlebots and Premium Blend with her ::mush::. She's so lovey.   Oh yeah, if you are one of those ignorant fools that think Pitbulls are born monsters, do your research and go to www.badrap.org.  The little rascals dog was a Pitbull!<p>
I'm really lazy lately, I haven't left the house and done anything normal for about a week.  I work at Subway, I get too cranky after work to get off my arse and do something.  My boss tortures me with things such as putting the onions on a sandwich before the lettuce.  This results in a tired and rather cranky Kelly B that only Jay will put up with.  Tommorow I feel obligated to get out, It's my second day in a row off and I'm going to utilize it!  So, If you see a short girl with short brown hair running around, kick her in the butt and tell her she never should have left her house because everything outside her room sucks and she's an ogre anyways.<p>
I'm out, more tommorow if I decide to maintain this ""thingie."""

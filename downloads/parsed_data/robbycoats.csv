"event","Well here I am, still stuck in tekas.  Will I ever get to go home, nobody knows.
Well, here's a list of events since I've been here:

When I arrived here last friday, Kevin picked me up and we went back to the apartment where we met Blake.  I sat around ery exhausted for a while, and then we went out to eat.  We went to On The Border... they still havent told me the border of what.  I had a burrito the size of my face.  I don't think it was actually calld a burrito, but thats what it was... thats what ALL mexican food is; burritos wth different names, as I pointed out to the waitress.  I randomly pointed at things on the menu and asked what they were, and they were all some kind of meat wrapped in some kind of tortilla... crazy mexicans.

The following day Blake took me out for breakfast and to the George Bush library... I did not get to check out a book.  We then went on a small tour of Tekas A&M, but everything was closed, so I didnt et to see much.  Blake took me to see the Century Tree, which, by the way, is the ultimate climbing tree.  Blake, however, would not let me clib it.  Century Tree is an oak tree that is so big it looks like 5 trees if you arent ""inside.""  It's so big that it cant support its own weight and is growing into the ground all over itself.  After that we met Kevin at the mall for pizza.

Kevin took me out to all the old bars that night... interesting history.  We ate at Freebirds, where I had another burrito, but it was a really really good burrito, so it was ok.  I want to go there again.  People make things out of the foil that their buritos are wrapped in and hang them everywhere.  Aparently it is also the Thunderbirds favorite spot in tekas.

I dont really remember much else.  I was supposed to leave after that... ha, ha, ha.

One of the days I was supposed to be englewood (two days ago) Kevin took me to see the Bonfire Memorial... simply stunning.  If something lke that would have happened at any other school, they might plant a tree.  Not here.  The spirit at this school is beyond description.

Last night we went to Santas Wonderland... a drive trough christmas lights dispaly of about a gabazibblillion lights.  Very nice.

As you can see, the more I type, the less effort I put into it.

Oh, and as for the reason I'm still here... kevin broke my airplane.  I was in the plane, ready to take off and go home, about to start the engine, and ae thought it might be funny if the starter went out... Whaddya know, it did.

"event","Good evening reader, I am writing to you tonight from Tekas, TX, Texas, USA.
Here I am in Texas, and I can't leave because I don't have an F-22.  If someone wants to buy me an F-22, I'll love you forever... I won't spend any time with you though, because I'll be in my F-22, but I'll love you.  The way things look now, I don't think I'll be out of here 'til Thursday... just in time to miss my final for Capt. Charmichael's class.  I talked to him this morning and he is going to let me make it up if I have to miss it.  Great guy.
Well, I flew out here on Friday morning, crossed the Gulf, stopped in n'Orleans for fuel (where the Atlantic Aviation just <i>gave</i> me a car to drive around town for food), then headed out to College Station.  It was starting to get dark about an hour after I left New Orleans and I was headed into an overcast layer, so I called up Houston Center for flight following (just to be safe).  Funny story about that, though... about 80miles out of College station, houston center calls me up, ""November-2-1-1-Juliet-Alpha, radar service terminated, VFR squak, have a nice flight,"" and not half a second later I must have gone under a GIANT thunderhead, because I was gaining and losing 100-200 feet every second... I thought my wings were going to be ripped right off.  I completely cut my power and was <i>still</i> doing 150mph, it was insane.  I descended down to about 200 feet off the trees, at night, to try to escape the turbulance, but it didnt get much better, and now I had to worry about zig zagging around a mess of radio towers, and my friking coumpas light was broke!  When I finally got out of that and closer to the airport, the beacon was like a light from god, and then the nice guy in the tower lit up juts my runway really really bright, and I about cried... it was so beautiful.  Well, I'm alive, and I have to do it all again.  I flew half way across the frikin coutry... holy damn jesus.

"event","I went and got checked out in a Grumman Tiger today for the trip out to Tekas on friday.  I don't know how much fun it will be , though, because my parents are adimently set aginst me going.  They say because I've never flown that far... well when the hell am i supposed to?.  
Anyway, it really is a neat airplane... fast for that kind of plane, 200mph, and excelent visibility.  The trip should take about 5 hours, but I not to terribly sure about that, I still have to plan my course.<br>

"event","Well yesterday was just jam packed with fun stuff, and by jam packed I actually mean that one fun thing happened, and it was only really fun for me and a little bit of fun for the other two involved.
Well heres how it went.  Cody and Rickey went to go see that stupid foozball game between the stealers and the dolphins, and on the way back while in Okeechobee city, cody got into a car wreck in which his radiator was obliterated... thats right, I said <i>obliterated.</i>  Robby to the rescue.  I got a call from Cody around 1 o'clock and he says, ""Robby, come get me.""  And I says, ""Holy crap, Cody.""
I was in Englewood getting ready to go back to Tampa and I was shipping out tons of packages or my ebay business.  I had NO time to drive to Okeechobee, and aparently I was the ONLY one who could help them.  I guess it takes about 4 hours to drive to where they were from Englewood.  Not me.  I decided there was only one way to take care of this problem; use my super awesomeness and hop in a plane and fly to Okeechobee county airport.  I got there in half an hour, and what a whole buncha' nothing there is on the way there.  For navigation I had to find some powerlines, arcadia, a prison, a lake, and finally Okechobee city.  The airport was pretty much deserted due to the hurricane, so when I landed, I just pulled right up next to Rickey and Cody and the building by which they were standing.  We loaded the plane and flew off into the sunset, with a full moon behind us.  It got really dark on the way home, so all I could do was pick a heading and follow it, without any ground references, and wait til I hit the coast line.  Of course, it worked out fine, I hit the coast and followed it up to Venice municipal.  So I flew a rescue mission. It was fun.

This is exactly what I am going to do on the 22nd, so everyone needs to come to my house and watch me fly over... AT OVER 100 MILES PER HOUR AND 50 FEET ABOVE THE TREES WOOOOOOOOO!!!!  I'd like to show everyone a ""slip"" too, which is flying SIDEWAYS.  If it's a good day and I feel good, maybe I'll do some more crazy stuff.  Hey, Lyndsay, since you so enjoyed my ""performance"" at the beach, wait 'til you see this.
Whoever will not be in attendance, I am going to ""slip"" over your house.

"event","Hurray for flying, and hurray for getting a few of your good friends together to recruit people on middle beach to stand in the formation of a smiley on the ground while I fly over and take a picture.

This all happened last saturday, so Im sorry this is late.  Anyways, heres how the course of events went:

11:00AM:  I arrive at middle beach, shovel in hand, pick a nice open spot, and begin to outline a giant smiely face

11:20AM:  Some old lady who goes to the beach to get away from children yells at me for digging.  Idiot.  Of course I was not bothering her in any way shape or form.

11:30AM:  Mike and Rickey arive to help outline the smiley... well, Mike arrives to help outline, and Rickey arrives to point out all the pretty ladies.

11:40AM:  We split up and begin walking the beach advertising out project.  ""Excuse me, floks, would you be interested in standing in the shape of a giant smiley face while I fly overhead and take a picture between 12:30 and 12:45?""

11:41AM:  Rickey's foot is killing him

11:50AM:  Oh my goodness, Im going to be late.  Tarra and Lyndsay arive just as Im leaving... Randall shows up a few minutes later.

11:52AM:  I speed like Ive never speed before to the airport.  The gang continues recruting.

12:35PM:  I begin taxing to the runway.  I signal mike via AT&T wireless text messaging service to start running up and down the beach yelling for everyone that was recruited to move into position.

12:40PM:  ""Venice traffic, Cessna 26-Lima departing runway 4, Venice traffic.""  I am finally in the air.  I depart the pattern to the south and head towards Middle Beach, getting pictures along the way

12:45PM:  I begin circling over the beach, and no one is there... mission failed.

12:46PM:  Wait, wait... there is activity... there are little ants making their way toward a common point curiously close to the smiley outline

12:46.5PM:  Those arent ants, theyre people!!!  HURRAY!  the beach is beginning to smile!!!

12:47PM:  I begin making multiple passes and taking as many pictures as I can... but, sadly, I dropped my camera...

12:47PM:  OH MAN!  APRIL FOOLS!  I take pictures, but sadly, for real this time, only enough people show up to make the smile and the eyes... no outline... but rickey makes up for that by standing out as the nose.  Randall flips me the bird.

12:50PM:  1000'  is far too high to get good pictures, so, legal or not (im really not sure), I go wings vertical and dive 600' at damn near 3000 fpm.  I later find out that I scared the shit out of Lyndsay ""He's falling... HES FALING! <font size=""+1""><font size=""+1"">HES FALLING!!!</font></font>"" she screams.  Tarra tells her it's OK.  Yeah, c'mon, I was just having fun.

12:57PM:  Well, I have my pictures... mission accomplished.  Everyone on the ground is getting bored and they begin to disperse.  i go do other things.



Well, there you have it, folks.  The picutes are very very large but well worth the look, so instead of putting them here, I have links to them.  Please go check them out.  The gang are all in the right eye... and nose.

"event","You made up your mind it was time it was over
After we had come so far
But I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart.

I would not have chosen the road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
But I think I can still find the will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart.

So fly go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find what you long for
Love that's written in the stars
And when you finally do I think you will see it's
Somewhere in my broken heart.

So fly go ahead and fly

"event","All of the conversations suggest that everything should be good and happy.  I can't lie to myself, though... I am still crying... and I still have a lot more painful questions that need to be answered.
How could this have ever happened, if not for me... it will always be my fault.  If I had not been so sensitive to the fact that she thought this was a good idea, I would have stopped it long before it happened... I was on the verge of saying what I thought... that our seperation was a bad idea... then didn't.  I am still the only cause of my pain... and hers.

...<b>Why didn't I say the things I needed to say</b>
How could I let my Angel get away
Now my world is just a'tumblin' down
I can see it so clearly, but you're nowhere around...

I have a certain scrapbook now... it is currently the most precious thing in the world to me.

Perhaps my melancholy personality stems from a subconscious desire to be sad.  Sad is a very complex emotion; I can see why I might enjoy it... but I don't enjoy it... at least not consciously.  At the same time, though, in this depression, I am happy... and grateful.  For this state of mind?  No.  But, I am grateful.

You are one of the few out there whose wings are truly ANGELIC. Selfless, powerful, and divine, you are one blessed with a certain cosmic grace. You are unequalled in peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of Light your wings are massive and a soft white or silver. Countless feathers grace them and radiate the light within you for all the world to see. You are a defender, protector, and caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver of the wrong, chances are you are taken advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often. But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in everyone and so this mistreatment does not make you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will try to help misguided souls find themselves and peace. However not all Angelics allow themselves to be gotten the better of - the Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting for the sake of Justice and protection of those less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever change - the world needs more people like you.

"event","Well, time to go back to tampa this evening.  I hate tampa.
Hmmm... life is strange.  Its really strange the way things are going, and its really strange that everbody understands what is going on, but noone can do anything about it.
Some interesting things happened while I was here that I need not go into detail about, but the future is looking good... we'll just say that I purchased a little something at curcuit city.  I suppose now it is just a race against time.

I went for my longest flight in a while last saturday; about three hours.  I made a cross country to Punta Gorda, and let me tell you, nobody knows a damn thing about what is going on at Charlotte county airport.  Buncha' lazy old bastards flying around there.  There were lots of planes in the pattern at all times, and people entering the pattern anywhere they damn well pleased!  I would be on my base leg, about to turn final, and some old guy would just fly straight into the final right in front of me!  This happened numerous times!  I cannot stress how much of a danger stuff like this is.  People were trying to fly the pattern backwards, for cyring out loud!  Don't get me wrong, I can get a damn good breakfast at PGD, but I was really happy to head back to Venice that day.
Well, next weekend is my FAA written exam, after which I will be fully liscenced.  Who wants to go flying?

"event","I hate tampa.  Awfully shady place.  The USF campus is really nice, though, and damn big.  My calsses are rediculous; I have Chem. for Engineers and it's on about a sixth grade level.  We've spent the last week or so ""learning""...... <i>""LEARNING""</i>(makes quotations motion with fingers in an over emphasized manner)... about what atoms are made of.  Wow.  The next few classes will discuss what the atomic number and mass means.  Worthy of yet another ""wow"".
Parking on campus is rediculous.  I was late for my Foundations of Engineering class by 30min just because I couldn't find a parking spot.  The good thing, though, is that I will never have to spend the near $200 on a perking permit like everyone else.  I only have to pay $3 for parking for the entire time that Im here.  I bought one of the $3 one day passes, and I have just been scanning it and changing the date to suit my needs, and it works just fine.  The parking Gestapo cant tell the difference.
Well, I'm coming home tomorrow for the weekend, like I plan to every weekend because I hate the God Awful place, but everyone else is coming up here, so I guess I will be all alone.
Saturday at noon I will be making a cross country flight to somewhere in northern florida... probabally Gainsville or something.  The AFROTC here has told me that they will pay for any further advancements to my pilots liscence, so hurray for that.

Well, I'm done.

The deed is done.  It is all I had thought about for about three days before I did it; I weighed the possible consequences, and decided that even though the outcome would be the loss of two of the greatest friends I have ever had, it was the right and it had to be done.  I hope it was right.  I know it must be, for I was trying to stop something that is wrong.  In just about any given situation, I know more than anyone thinks I know.  What I knew was fact; it does happen and no one will ever convince me otherwise...  certainly not be franticly telling me I don't know a damn thing about what was going on.  But I do know.  Whether or not anyone belives me is irrelevant.  I can prove it, but won't.  All I intended to do was expose, and that is what I did.  Do with the information what you will, for I was done when I started.  If I had wanted any further part in anything, don't you think I would have at least signed my name?  Nevertheless, the deed is done, and I am no better off for it.  I never had the intention of gaining anything out of this, only the posibility of loss.  Oh, I know it well.  So, now I am deeply saddened because of what I have done to myself, but I belived it had to be done.  It hurts hurting those you love, but I could not be aware of such things and just let them go...  Are you reading this?  The second I put it in the mail, I knew I would never talk to either one of you again.  Don't you understand?  I <i>knew</i> it.  Yet I did it anyway, ignoring the pain, because it was right.  I thought that maybe, if I didn't sign my name, I could avoid all of this... A brief, bright flash of dark, and false hope.
""Oh well"" I suppose.
Nothing will <b>ever</b> change... remember that.
I suppose I can only find comfort in the fact that I will never do that to anyone, nor am I even capable of it.  I was right.

Sincerely,

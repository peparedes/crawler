"event","For now, hope is greater than fear in our country (if only by a little bit).

The people who came out and volunteered at our field office and everywhere else are amazing.  We really built something throughout this process.  But we can't let it end there.  We have to keep the momentum we've established going and hold our newly-elected leaders to the ideals we fought for.  We're on the hook for this now, too.

Similarly, being involved in a campaign is a lot of fun and a lot of hard work.  It's also very rewarding.  I feel a sense of ownership that I haven't felt in a long time.  This wasn't just an election that I voted in, this was my election.  And that's going to keep me motivated to fight for change.

Yanking out campaign signs (no matter whose name is printed on them) says more about the person doing it than anything else.  As does being rude to people who call you or knock on your door.  It also doesn't accomplish anything.

The kids are alright.  They might not have come out to vote in the numbers we hoped everywhere, but a lot of young people were involved in this election.

People who drive people to their precinct to vote in their first election are rad."

"event","On Friday night, <lj user=""spacesamurai""> and I went to see Shawn Colvin perform at <a href=""http://www.theclaytoncenter.com/"">the Clayton Center</a>.  While it's not my usual musical fare, it was a lot of fun!  The venue is very small and intimate, allowing Ms Colvin to interact with the audience quite a bit.

Since we weren't sure how long it would take us to get there (and Clayton was much closer than I thought), we arrived pretty early.  We took the opportunity to explore the city's downtown area.  It was neat!  Lots of small shops, most of which were closed (!) for the night, including the coffee shop that we had scoped out in case we arrived early.

On Saturday night, we went to dinner with our little book club and talked about <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Let-Now-Praise-Famous-Men/dp/0395488974"">Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</a>.  It was a lot of fun, and we chose the next few books we're going to read, all of which I'm very interested in.  Yay!

Today, I pretended I was going to exercise, but I somehow managed to keep putting it off to do ""other things"".  Yet, I don't really feel like I accomplished anything.  And I didn't really manage to rest either.  I'm not really sure where the day went to be honest!"

That in no way makes up for the quantity of yummy Italian food I ate last night at a party for <lj user=""spacesamurai"">'s book club.  I'm <i>still</i> stuffed.  It was a lot of fun!"

"event","I failed at rescuing a spider tonight.  It was crawling around on the floor and now it's dead. :-(

I was going to release it outside where it could eat some bugs (since that's probably where it crawled in from).  Poor thing couldn't find purchase on the side of the little plastic bowl that I trapped it in, and, when I tried to coax it onto the paper plate I was improvising with, it made a break for it.  I tried to recapture it in my bowl and chopped it in half.

Poor spider."

"event","While I was watching the exciting match between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal this morning, I started thinking about some of the reasons soccer (ahem, football) is not more popular here in the States.  People dismiss the sport for a number of reasons (and I might go into some of these later), but one of them sticks out in my mind for the little amount of discussion it receives and how fundamental it could be to people's perceptions.

A lot of people I've talked to have only watched soccer during the FIFA World Cup.

Don't get me wrong, I really love the World Cup.  The games are often intense, dramatic, and filled with incident.  Because the stakes are so high, the play in them is also often quite conservative, methodical, and sometimes even cynical.  And, to a soccer neophyte, boring.

When people give the game a chance, they should really be watching competitive league games.  Preferably with others who are already passionate about the game and the teams involved.

So get to a sports bar that shows games (I'm a fan of the Premiership), and give soccer a try.  If nothing else, it's an excuse to have a brew (or three) before noon on a Saturday!"

"event","I recently finished reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393323315/sr=8-2/qid=1141871660/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-4036135-9705400?%5Fencoding=UTF8"">the Sea Hawk</a> by Rafael Sabatini.  I enjoyed it.

The book tells the tale of Sir Oliver Tressilian's betrayal by his brother and the woman he loves, his subsequent enslavement and rise to power, and his quest for revenge against those that wronged him.  It includes all of the elements of a swashbuckler, but it doesn't become silly.  It's also a relatively quick read once you get used to Sabatini's style, and I found it difficult to put down.

Sabatini was apparently a prolific author, and I'm reading Scaramouche next.  I'll let you know what I think!"

"event","Well.

Forces beyond my ken blew a plug out of my truck's radiator, and it had to be replaced.  Fortunately, the mechanics found no coincidental damage to the engine caused by overheating, etc.  I did not expect any because I stopped after a relatively short distance when I realized my engine was overheating, but it was still Good News.

I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the unnamed gentleman who got my attention and informed me, while traveling down a highway at ~65 m.p.h., that my truck was ""dropping fluid"".  Had it not been for him the damage might have been much worse.  And the two (2) people who stopped to see if I needed help.

To the hundreds of folks that drove by without sparing their fellow human a second look, I say: Feh!

Meh, cars.

"event","I had to call my cable provider today because, for the fourth time in as many months, I did not receive a bill.  This has led to two late payments and associated late fees and a letter threatening to cut off my cable.  Needless to say, I was ready to put an end to this problem.

So I called customer service and punched the buttons to have my call connected to billing.  After waiting for a couple of minutes, my call was answered.  I answered several questions to verify my identity and explained my problem to the woman who fielded my call.  She put me on hold to investigate.  After holding for a few more minutes, she returned and explained to me that I had enrolled in Electronic Billing.

What?

I certainly did not.  I explained this to her politely and told her that I couldn't even access the on-line billing page for my account and hadn't been able to do so for several months.  I suspect the origin of the problem coincides with the transition, but more on that later.  She kept trying to explain to me how to change the option on the website.  I kept politely telling her that I couldn't.  After a few minutes of this back and forth exchange, she got the idea that I wasn't just an idiot and forwarded my call to technical support.

Note to Charter: please add a menu option beyond one for help with e-mail and another for help with connectivity.  My problem fell into neither category, and even if the option just connects with one of the other two help desks, it would have given me a sense that I was doing everything I could to have my call dealt with promptly and by the right people.

Again, when my call was fielded, I explained my problem with a preface about how I was unsure whether or not I had even connected with the right people.  The polite young woman who helped me promptly delt with my issue.  It seems I had two valid logins associated with my high speed internet, but only one of them was associated with my cable service as well.

The two women to whom I spoke were both helpful and understanding, and they seemed to really want to help me get my problem solved.  I suspect my problem originated when I payed a bill a few months ago by telephone.  I somehow became automatically enrolled in their electronic billing program or I failed to hit the right button to tell them that I didn't want to be enrolled in said program.  This, coupled with the fact that my account was a mess and they transitioned to a new billing system, meant that I couldn't fix the problem.

Another note to Charter: Don't automatically enroll people in stuff.

But now it's fixed and I have a hard time being too angry about it since the length of the problem was in part due to my reticence toward getting to the bottom of my missing bills.

A third note to Charter: Your electronic billing site requires Internet Explorer or Netscape.  I use neither.  And it is not because I am some off the wall zealot.  My computer of choice is an Apple PowerBook, and the best browser for me is Apple's own Safari.  Please make your web site architecture independent.

This was going to be a rant, but it turned into a description of the problem, its suspected causes, and the assistance that two helpful customer service representatives provided to me."

I agree with her supposition that the internet has changed the way we communicate.  She attributes some of punctuation's degradation to the immediacy of the medium.

I noticed an even more troubling problem: people don't think about the words they write on e-mails or web sites.  Unlike Ms. Truss, I can stomach poor punctuation.  Certainly, I wish people took more care, but usually a misplaced apostrophe does not confound the meaning of a missive or web site.  Even so, I still find myself finishing an e-mail and wondering what I have read.  The words are easy enough, but their meaning is bewildering.  I read such messages again, hoping their contents will become clear.  Even more damning, I have succumbed to the immediacy of the internet myself; I have reread e-mail I have sent and been just as befuddled.

As a result of my observations and introspection, I have decided to slow down.  Rather than let my fingers do my thinking for me, I am going to try to organize my thoughts before I put a word on the page.  I hope this will help me to say something meaningful, but more importantly in the faceless, voiceless vacuum of cyberspace, I hope that it will help me convey my meaning to the reader, even if that reader is me.

Finally, I leave you with an <a href=""http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm"">essay</a> by George Orwell about language.  Unfortunately, the points he raises are a topic for a different day."

"event","I doubt that anyone will contradict me when I say that ESPN has a tremendous amount of power in the realm of cable content providers.  As a result, right now they are able to live the capitalist's dream.

Because they have so much muscle, ESPN is able to charge an exorbitant price to your cable provider... per channel... per customer.  When a cable company balks at the rates and tries to move ESPN into a higher tier (i.e. only charging the people who want to pay for the ESPN family of networks), ESPN leverages this power to force the cable provider to leave them as a basic cable channel.  They basically tell the cable companies, either leave us as a basic channel or we'll take our ball and go home.  It doesn't always work, but the majority of the time, the cable company will cave.

That means that ESPN is increasing your cable bill significantly, whether you care about sports or not.  You could, of course, simply give up cable television, but if you like any of the other channels you get, that amounts to cutting off your nose to spite your face.

One day, I hope to own a business that's large enough to /force/ people to pay for my products.  As I said, the capitalist's dream.

In America we have become consumers instead of customers.  We no longer buy the things we want for a fair price, we simple consume what large corporations put in front of us because, often, we have no choice or what choice we do have isn't obvious.

With the growth of satellite television (Direct TV, etc.), cable companies may be forced to compete.  Unless we pay attention, the satellite market will become a replica of the cable market."

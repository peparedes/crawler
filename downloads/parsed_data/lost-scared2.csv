"event","I am going to take a break from beating my head against the wall to write this. Maybe I'll spare myself some of the brain damage. (If I can actually be more messed up in the head at this point.)

Lately I keep seeing... or think I've been seeing... these men everywhere I go. This has been going on for a while. I'm pretty sure it's all in my head (I've been known to have problems like this) but it's starting to affect my life. I am definitely visiting the doctor about it to see if I can get some pills or something to fix it.

Today I was working at the studio, with my boyfriend/boss John. Normal day. A couple brought their kids in for some photos (the ""sentimental"" deal, which does family portraits and things of that nature.) I love working with children; it's probably the best part of this job... The parents, however, are a different story, especially when they're rich and snotty like these ones were.

Part of my job description is to help people pick out what photo package they want. (This basically means what sizes/how many copies of the photos you want to buy.) Usually this is a fairly easy task, but I've never been an amazing ""people person"" so it's probably not my best area unfortunately.

Anyway, this couple was taking a really long time to decide what they wanted- and I should have been doing the whole marketing spiel I was taught to give everyone, so that (and I won't sugar-coat this) they feel more inclined to give us more money than they might otherwise. But out of the corner of my eye I saw this dark van outside the window. I looked over, and there were two men sitting in it watching me. A wave of... not exactly fear, but... anxiety, I guess, just washed over me. I couldn't move. I must have been like that for some time, because when I snapped out of it, John was there telling the rather upset father to calm down. Apparently they were trying to tell me what they wanted for longer than they were willing to stand around waiting for.

I looked back outside, and nothing was even there- no men, no van, nothing unusual. It had seemed so real, but it was just some kind of hallucination I guess.

Needless to say, John sort of got on my case about it. And he wasn't very happy when I wouldn't tell him what was wrong. Not that I know what's wrong.

I mean jesus, it's not like I'm about to start spouting off that utter nonsense that I thought happened to me a long time ago, and that now I'm hallucinating about men following me around. I refuse to be the crazy lady again babbling about aliens and conspiracies. Especially when I don't even believe in that ridiculous crap anymore.

I will have a normal life. I just have to try harder.

And I've scheduled a doctors' appointment for the day after tomorrow. I am sure all this can be cleared up in no time.



On a slightly different note, a familiar newspaper showed up at my house today and I have no idea where it came from. I didn't order one... I was off their mailing list ages ago! And I doubt Langly sent it to me. I feel like I'm being toyed with here. I don't like it."

"event","I was browsing the internet innocently enough when I randomly happened to stumble upon this thing. My, how time flies.

Reading back, I can't help but cringe thinking about what a whiny, spazzy, childish little... brat, I really was. That kind of thing is okay when you're 13, not 30! Oh dear. Well maybe I can give myself some comfort in knowing that, perhaps, I've matured a little at least since my last entries here.

(And dear God, what was I thinking with this fluorescent pink layout? I think my eyes are starting to bleed just <i>thinking</i> about it.)

Actually, quite a lot has happened to me in the almost ... two years (my god, that's a frightening prospect) I've spent away from Live Journal. I'm still living in Sioux City, and I work as an assistant to a professional photographer in town. Much better work than Staples was, that's for sure! I'm also taking night classes at the community college here, where I'm studying English Literature, Comparative Religion and Calculus. That's right, I'm doing <i>Calculus</i>! I can be a smart girl if I want to be. ;)

I suppose it might be worth mentioning that I've sort of lost touch with Langly and the rest of the Gunmen since I last wrote. I didn't realize what a burden I was to them. I wonder if they'll ever know how sorry I am for all that stupid silliness I created in their lives... especially my former boyfriend. They're all destined for greatness, and I would hate to think that I was holding them back from that for whatever reason.

That isn't to say, however, that I don't still think about him/them from time-to-time, of course. But I'm sure it's really better that we've moved on from each other. Especially considering that I'm sort of... seeing someone. That is, my boss, John, well... Do the math, I guess. We've only been together a couple of months, but I guess things are going pretty well.

Kevin is also well. We went through sort of a rough patch together for a while, where he didn't want to talk to me, etc. We're quite close again now though. I think that was really just him in his ""rebellious"" phase, which he has (thank god) grown out of a bit. He still has his strong-willed attitude, something he didn't have as a child, so I think that's healthy. But one thing he's always had was a strong sense of intuition, and he's always been kind of a smarty-pants (that one's for sure). Needless to say, he's now putting all of that to good use as a trainee Police Cadet here in Sioux City. Who would have predicted that one?

He's now living with his girlfriend on the other side of town. Things are looking pretty serious between them. ;) Ahh, young love...

As for my own past feelings and experiences... Well, I've decided to put all that stuff behind me. Maybe mom was right about just letting the past go. There's no point in being such a sad case all the time if you can function just fine looking forward instead of back."

"event","So the kung-fu thing I mentioned in my last entry? Well, I cheated a little... but whatever. We found him, and that's what's important.

I'll start this entry with the how and the why.

I was at my wit's end. I was ready to hurt someone. That someone was just about to be me, before someone knocked on the door.

But it wasn't Ringo, it was this guy named Kimmy.

Mr. Belmont, well, I managed to overlook his more bizarre and/or offensive behavior... simply because he had the know-how to find my big dummy (even if he was looking for him for his own reasons, not out of the will to help me personally...)

And if you're wondering about those reasons, I didn't catch all of it, but apparently ""Lord Manhammer"" was in debt just north of $75... because of a small loss in a game of D&D. >.>

Anyway, so... somehow... Kimmy found out where Langly was. We traced him back to this shitty little hotel room in a suburb of DC called Reston, where he'd been apparently angsting in his bathrobe and pajamas the entire time.

He was shit surprised to see us, as well he should have been. But honestly, I think a part of him was hoping I'd find him... contrary to what he was saying. He was definitely depressed.

But I was pissed, in case you couldn't tell.

Kimmy had been trying to get the money he wanted, and was getting kinda worked up in the process... But he was nothing compared to what I unleashed once my brain fully comprehended just how angry I really was.

I definitely scared both of them shitless.

Not that I cared... I was so mad at him. I don't even remember half of what I said. I felt like a timebomb finally going off.

And somewhere down the line - I'm not sure where - I started crying... and apologizing. And I guess Kimmy felt awkward, because he left (and, concequentially, Langly still hasn't paid off his debt).

But we just kinda stood there and hugged for a while. And then I took him home.

The carride home we were completely silent... and now he's in the other room talking to Byers and Frohike.

So I guess things haven't been completely resolved just yet.



But I hope he comes out soon."

"event","So, these last few days have been really stressful. I've been looking for him, along with Byers, Frohike, and Jimmy. No luck, though I was a little relieved that he posted (he's alive!)

But I've mostly been angsting about it up until now. I feel/felt so terrible, and I haven't dealt with it very well I'm afraid... (we won't get into that, but I have lost 5 pounds, so do the math).

Um, but I'm actually kinda pissed off now. He better be done sulking. I want him back, and he can suck it up. Yeah, I did something stupid, and maybe I deserve this a little, but who the hell is he to run off and make me freak out?

Yeah, if you're reading this you big dummy, I'm not buying your ""I need more time to be alone blah blah blah"" shit. I'm gonna find you, and you're not gonna know what hit you when I do.

"event","I screwed up. :(

So... the other night, I'd been up late going through some old issues of the one and only TLG, just, you know, reading their older stuff and drinking in the wisdom of it all. I guess I got a little carried away though, because I didn't get to bed until some ungodly hour in the morning... and...

Well, he woke me up at 10:something. I think. It's still a little bit foggy. And by 'him,' yes, I mean my sweet Langly... He woke me up by kissing my cheek, which normally would have been the sweetest thing I'd ever felt, but at that moment I was dreaming about someone I hate, so I was like, ""mmmph, fuck you,"" or something like that. Not a great start, but he apparently had the will to continue what he was doing, so thank goodness I didn't scare him off completely.

So he tried to get me up one more time, this time by shaking me a little bit and saying my name. I sat up, but my head was still foggy, and proof once more that Ruby-on-4-hours-of-sleep does NOT function well. Anyway, by now I was halfway aware that I was talking to him, so I was like, ""oh, hey sweetie"" in kind of a drunk-ish voice. (Seriously, I may as well have been drunk, because, save getting sick everywhere, that's what it was like.)

Anyway, um. Thinking back? I think HE PROPOSED TO ME. AHHHH.

But I don't remember entirely. But I'm 99% sure that's what happened, because I did something really, really stupid, and now Langly is MISSING. MISSING!

I have to find him, too, because if what I believe happened did indeed happen, then we need to fix this now! I'm freaking out as I type this, and my hands are shaking, and it's all because if we broke up again... and over a misunderstanding...

The point is... I love him. I honestly, truly love him. He means everything to me. And... it's a big deal for me, because I don't think I could handle rejectment twice. (Long story short, I really liked this other guy a few years ago, but when I told him be laughed and called me a hooker. FUN. :D)

I don't know many things for certain, but I do know that I want to be with him forever. And I can't picture myself with anyone else.


So... Langly... if you're out there somewhere reading this... Please come back. I'm sorry for everything..."

I swear to god, I've built up such a tolerance to my depression pills, that they just make me worse now. *falls over*

I don't want to complain, but I'm just so BORED here. I guess that's why I locked this from Ringo. I don't want him to worry about me. He just always seems so happy to be working on his newspaper that I get sort of caught up in making sure that he stays happy... and I stop thinking about myself.

My job...which I don't even need...is the most boring thing that you could ever imagine. It's like, I go there with the intention of having something to do, and then it's like, ""Uhh, no Ruby... you can't have fun because you're a loser and you suck at life.""

Uh-huh.

In any case, I've been loosing a lot of weight lately. And I had an eating disorder when I was a teenager, so it feels really.... not cool to be doing this again, even if it isn't intentional like it once was.

Ahhhh whatever.

Maybe this'll just go away. Sometimes this sort of thing happens to me and it resolves itself."

But this thing with Emily is weird. That... if I may cuss... is some fucked up radiation. But regardless, she seems to be okay, so everyone's thankful for that. And Em, I know I've told you this a million times already, but you're a really gorgeous 25 year old. A lot prettier than I was at 25, that's for certain. And when you're feeling down, you can still come to me, like always. :)

I've been really enjoying my time here with <s>Richard</s> Langly. We had a small fight recently, over how much time he spends working on building video games instead of doing more productive things. He got mad at me for that, and he called me 'mom'. MOM. Well damn, way to make me cringe, Mr. Videogames-only. :P But we worked it out, obviously. He got me addicted to his stupid new game, so I HAVE to let him work on it.

I guess it's official... as the girlfriend of a gamer, I'm morphing into one myself. I used to only like tetris and stuff, but I've been playing Doom lately, which is so out of character for me, that it's kind of scary at times. o_o;;;;

It's all just been cheap thrills up til now. I really regret it all... all my ex boyfriends (who were hardly boyfriends at all...) were fun for a while... I liked the idea of just fucking around with guys (uhh... quite literally... I think I was like 16 or so when I lost my virginity =X ) and being... the center of attention, in a way.

That's probably more than any of you would like to know, but too bad. >)

In any case, I feel really bad about that stuff. It wasn't cool in any way to just have boy toys to hang out with.... especially since it was just a way to stop thinking about.... other things.

Kevin knew about all of that. And he tried to help me for a while, but then he got sick of trying. I can't say I really blame him for being angry, though.

But the stuff I tried to forget about is responsible for me finding Langly. I mean, isn't it? There are so many things that they've done... and our government, apparently, that I disagree with. But if I hadn't been infected with that crap I never would have...

Uh, I lost that thought. Whoops. But you get the idea. I hope.

I don't know why I did what I did. But I did it anyway.

I was missing him. Langly (why do I call him that, anyway? I guess it's because he hates to be called by his first name), that is. So I drove to DC to look for him. Almost to DC, that is. I had to stop for gas somewhere in West Virgina... and that's where I met Emily.

I thought I recognized her when I drove in. Then it occured to me that this was the girl from Mulder and Scully's wedding.

So I went over to her and, after asking her if she really was who I thought she was (which she was), I asked her what she was doing all the way out here without anyone else. She made me promise not to tell anyone her story, and I did. (Which may not have been the brightest move, considering how much the Gunmen are going to kick my ass when they find out.)

She ran away... because of issues... poor girl. This isn't just some teen drama, either... this is real stuff.

Anyway, I took her to a hotel in town, and that's where we are now. She's asleep on the other bed.

We talked a lot up until about an hour ago... and... wow... She has problems.

I don't know what to do now, or where we'll go from here. I guess my plan to find Langly kinda failed... for now, anyway... but I'm sort of glad I found Emily, or God knows what could have happened to her.

It's kind of interesting how sometimes you don't know quite how you're feeling until you talk to someone. You could feel blah or happy, but then when you have a conversation, you realize that you're really pretty sad or angry.

I hate myself for what I am. I hate the way I never really grew up. I hate my hair and my face (which is pretty slutty, I guess) and I hate the clothes I wear and the car I drive and the life I live. I hate it all so much. I'm sick of myself. I hate how I only take life seriously when I fall into those shitty bouts with depression, and even then my judgement is seriously clouded.

But that's because I'm... eh, I'm a dumb bitch, I guess. That seems to be the best way to describe myself.

I tried to count all the guys I've been with last night. And I got frustrated because I couldn't. There have been so many! And as I said before, I never grew up. I never got over this stupid slutty me. I'm fucking older than 30 now, but I still feel like I'm 15. And I act like it too.

I guess I know what this is about. Yeah, him. I piss myself off because I still think about him. And I really, really loathe myself for crying. This wasn't supposed to hurt. I was supposed to just get over this. But I didn't. I haven't and I can't and I can only hope that I will some day.

He kinda... he kinda killed something in me. I used to have so much self-esteem, but now it's just like... gone. I got ditched by Langly because I creeped him out. That felt like shit. But I should have been able to handle it. I should have.

And I didn't.

I hate him for making me feel this way.

I'll be doing something ordinary. Typing on the computer. Listening to my headphones. Playing that stupid game I downloaded to my cell phone. Then I'll see something outside, out of the corner of my eye. I'll try to get up and look out the window, but I can't move. I try to scream, but I can't breathe. A painful rememberance of a past experience. I happen to look down. I see my brother, asleep. We're at the lake. I'm 18 again. And I'm fucking scared, too. Then I brace myself for what's to come. The next thing I know, I'm lying down, and I feel this intense pain, all over my body.

Suddenly I can turn my head, and I do, and I see someone else is there as well. Someone who they are doing tests on, like me. I strain my eyes in the light to see who it is, but then just before I can recognise a face, I feel myself wake up. One night I was digging my nails so hard into my arm that there was blood running down my wrist and onto my sheets.

But it was just a dream.

I hope so, anyway...

Last night I woke up and I just screamed. Langly came in to see what was wrong, and ended up sleeping there with me. I was so scared I just started bawling in his arms.


So of course the guys have been taking care of me even more than when we all thought I just had your average cold. I don't know if they still think that or not, but they've been taking extra-good care of me.

Something is wrong here, really wrong, and I'm scared that something bad is going to happen more than ever."

So I guess Frohike saw, um, me and Langly yesterday. x) We didn't even know until I read Frohike's entry, and I ended up telling Langly. Frohike is just like, freaking out, and I'm laughing my ass off. Langly is like oh SHIT. It's sooooooooooo cute! <3

It's not like this hasn't happened to me a million times before. Once mom caught me and my boyfriend and, uh, that was a little akward, but now I just think it's hilarious. Public making-out is the best though, cause you can sometimes see people's reactions. Plus it's 50x hotter. XD

Okay, I know you guys... really... don't want to know that, so I'm going to shut up.

Poor Kevin, he has to read all of this. XD"

They have lots of gadgets and gizmos and stuff here. I feel so computer illiterate when I hear them talking, because they say things like, ""There's a problem with the FTP and I can't upload ____, also I'm looking for the IP address of ______ but I can't get it because the ____ isn't _____. Also, have you seen the fhjedgjhugiwfkdjfi-afier? I can't find it and I need it to make this USB connection to work!"" AAAUGH! What???

They might as well be speaking French. Ack.

Oh well. I know, um, how to use MS Paint! Yeah! I rock.

Ok, I suck at computers, but I think I can learn.

Frohike's mostly avoiding us now. Well, me anyway. Probably has something to do with that AIM convo we had a while back. I know he's really embarrassed and all. Aw.

Too bad for him, I have my guy and he can't get in the way. x)

Speaking of Langly, he's the best. Ever. I'm just so happy when I'm around him. I mean like, I'll have a day that's just the suck and then I see him and it's like all of that goes away, and I know where I belong. ^_^ I don't know if I've ever felt like that.

And I've been with, um, I can't count how many guys. Not a good sign. I made some mistakes. But I'm done with that now.

I'm off, Langly keeps bugging me. ;) I think we'll go out for a while, so, um, more later definitely. Enough computer access here for a small school. :P

RMorris320: You there?
lrdmanhammer: Hey girl - You caught me as I was about to put the finishing touches on next week's issue. 
lrdmanhammer: What's up?
RMorris320: cool beans
RMorris320: nothing
RMorris320: kevins being an ass
RMorris320: gr.
lrdmanhammer: Tell him Frohike will come and kick his ass if he does anything to piss you off. 
lrdmanhammer: : P 
RMorris320: aw, frohike likes it when he bugs me.
RMorris320: ^_~
RMorris320: I think it's rather cute
lrdmanhammer: Frohike? CUTE?
lrdmanhammer: *hurls*
lrdmanhammer: Not likely. 
RMorris320: no, I just mean how jealous he is
RMorris320: I don't think *he's* cute
RMorris320: don't worry, I don't cheat. ;-)
lrdmanhammer: Better not, especially not with the toad. :-) 
lrdmanhammer: Frohike just wants someone, I guess.
RMorris320: of course he does.
lrdmanhammer: He's tired of lying to everyone about how lucky he is with girls. *hahaha*
RMorris320: toad! lol!
RMorris320: aww
RMorris320: poor guy
RMorris320: but its kind of funny, no offense to him
lrdmanhammer: Better watch what you say - he's meandering around the office and he's liable to come over here at any second and check out what we're saying about him! : )
RMorris320: oops! heehee! :-X
RMorris320: I can't wait to see you again.
lrdmanhammer: I miss you too much. Playing Doom just isn't the same without you there to retch at the gory images. *haha*
RMorris320: um? Ha ha, I'll take that as a compliment. I think.
RMorris320: video games are fun, though.
lrdmanhammer: Hell yea. Which reminds me, I gotta start creating the next edition of Lord Manhammer's Quest. It'll make Doom look like Blue's Clues.
RMorris320: can you really make video games?
lrdmanhammer: Of course! Nothing to it. All it takes is a master of computer science and know-how. 
RMorris320: wow, thats really cool!
lrdmanhammer: :-) We can even make one for the kiddies called ""The Nasty Bureaucrat Chasers"" or something. 
lrdmanhammer: hahaha
RMorris320: awww, hahahahahaha
RMorris320: *I'D* buy it. ;-)
lrdmanhammer: Nah, I'd give you a copy. ;-)
lrdmanhammer: I miss you lots.
RMorris320: aw, how sweet.
RMorris320: I miss you too.
RMorris320: I've been thinking about you a lot
RMorris320: :-)
lrdmanhammer: Me too. I was actually thinking about taking a short break from the paper to come and see you. Or you could come stay with us, if Kevin is with Gibson. Wouldn't want you to be alone or anything.
RMorris320: Yeah, they're going to go away tomorrow. Don't know where. Ha ha, I guess they don't really know either.
RMorris320: But, I'd love to see you.
RMorris320: I'd always love that. :-)
lrdmanhammer: You should come up. The guys would love to see you again. Female interaction is good for them. :-)
RMorris320: *laughing* sure.
RMorris320: just make frohike promise to shut up for once
RMorris320: or he will face the concequences. <3
lrdmanhammer: Hey, you could finally teach them all of the things they missed out on during puberty. Anything and everything about ""chicks.""
lrdmanhammer: hahaha
lrdmanhammer: Of course - Frohike won't be able to speak once I'm done with him.
RMorris320: Um, how about no?
RMorris320: eveything.... they don't wanna know that
RMorris320: 0.o
RMorris320: ha ha frohike. x)
lrdmanhammer: 5ja ale98 234ir5 qdl;f 
RMorris320: hm?
RMorris320: you ok?
lrdmanhammer: What the hippie means is, you two better not start that lovey-dovey la73198u 5r2o3iu45 892
RMorris320: frohike??
lrdmanhammer: Damn Frohike got on. >:-(
lrdmanhammer: Don't worry, I told you I would take care of him.
RMorris320: well, tell him if he doesn't stop, I'll make him watch while we slow dance.
RMorris320: *laughing extra hard*
lrdmanhammer: *laughs* The government will find out where we are if I don't stop laughing so loudly. : ) 
lrdmanhammer: We can put on a Ramones tune to really piss him off.
lrdmanhammer: haha
RMorris320: ha ha! but they could never find you guys while I'm with you. ^_^
RMorris320: lol!
RMorris320: poor frohike. Oh well, he gets a taste of his own medicine.
lrdmanhammer: Byers is having a talk with him right now about not being rude. : ) 
RMorris320: aww.
RMorris320: Byers is so parental. XD
lrdmanhammer: Yea, he's just like a Dad. Only he's too proper. 
RMorris320: eek. does that mean that that suzanne modeski person is mom? O_O
lrdmanhammer: Eeep! 
lrdmanhammer: I hope not. 
lrdmanhammer: haha
RMorris320: well, I don't have parents now, so nyeehhh. >:P
RMorris320: ha ha. Well, I have dad, but, not really.... aw I don't know. Bleh.
lrdmanhammer: Mine is still stuck on a farm in Nowheresville, Nebraska. So don't feel too bad. 
RMorris320: I don't know where my dad is. I havn't seen him since mom and him got divorced. meh. I don't even want to know where that bastard is.
lrdmanhammer: Ditto. Dads are dumbasses. 
lrdmanhammer: Hey, that gives me another idea for a game....
RMorris320: *laugh* blow up as many of the dads as you can in 50 seconds?
lrdmanhammer: Heyyyy, great idea! 
RMorris320: I was kidding!
lrdmanhammer: *lol* Sorry, my brain is stuck into work overdrive here. 
RMorris320: heehee. ^_^
lrdmanhammer: All work and no play makes Lord Manhammer a dull gamer.
RMorris320: you're never dull to me.
RMorris320: *smile*
lrdmanhammer: izxclxcxc8948u9vjkv n     lsfd
lrdmanhammer: The geek is blushing now, congrats.
RMorris320: frohike, get a life
RMorris320: and a girl
RMorris320: ;-)
RMorris320: stop bugging us!!
lrdmanhammer: Hey, plenty of chicks want the studmaster. They just don't know where to look.
RMorris320: yeah right
lrdmanhammer: Who could resist a little taste of Frohike?
RMorris320: you're a toad
lrdmanhammer: So I see. And you used to be such a sweet girl in a hotel room. hehehee
RMorris320: sweet girl? if you knew what my nickname was in highschool, I kinda doubt you'd say that. But we won't go there.
lrdmanhammer: Oh really? Now you've aroused my curiousity....
RMorris320: :-[
lrdmanhammer: 45;u9 8wjfk 
lrdmanhammer: stupid asshole Frohike won't quit, will he?
RMorris320: no, and he said he would! that little.... grrrrr.....
lrdmanhammer: It took both Byers and myself to pull him away this time. 
RMorris320: strong little bugger, eh?
lrdmanhammer: He just can't get enough of torturing people.
lrdmanhammer: His poor mother....
lrdmanhammer: she BIRTHED him. 
RMorris320: poor you, you LIVE with him
lrdmanhammer: Yea, poor me. 
lrdmanhammer: But if you come along, it can be poor us. :-)
RMorris320: Pfft, hell no, if I came, it would be poor them and, um, the-opposite-of-poor us?
RMorris320: I don't know. :-P
lrdmanhammer: ????? Been dipping into the hot sauce again, have we? hahaha
RMorris320: no, just being stupid, as usual.
RMorris320: :P
RMorris320: no biggie. Hahaha
lrdmanhammer: You're not stupid. You're gorgeous. ;-)
lrdmanhammer: And I want to see you soon. 
RMorris320: aww!
RMorris320: you know I want to see you too. :-)
RMorris320: I think you're wonderful. ^_______^
lrdmanhammer: So come up here. We've got a spare bedroom. It's not as cozy as the hotel, but it'll do. Plus it's far away from Frohike's room. Bleccch.
RMorris320: You think of everything.
RMorris320: I'll come. :D
lrdmanhammer: Great. :-) Need a spare identity, or do you think you'll be safe?
lrdmanhammer: We can get you a plane ticket.
RMorris320: I'll be fine. ^_^ you don't have to do that. Hah.
RMorris320: they don't want me anyway
lrdmanhammer: Too bad - one is already booked for you. *grin*
lrdmanhammer: That's what happens when you date a master hacker. :-) 
RMorris320: *sigh* fine.
lrdmanhammer: Free stuff up the wazoooo!
RMorris320: thats so sweet!
lrdmanhammer: : ) Knew you would think so.
RMorris320: you're great. But I don't need stuff to know that I like you.
RMorris320: :-)
lrdmanhammer: ;-) It's registered under a Jade Morpheus. 
lrdmanhammer: One of the best female characters in gaming land. 
lrdmanhammer: er, nevermind. :-)
RMorris320: cool!
RMorris320: I like samus aran too
RMorris320: cool power suit. ^_~
lrdmanhammer: That's my girl. 
RMorris320: :D
lrdmanhammer: Alright, it's registered for tomorrow, so I'll call you before it's scheduled to leave.
lrdmanhammer: Make sure you get there ok.
RMorris320: I will
RMorris320: :-)
lrdmanhammer: Watch out for government commies and their large black limos, or so Byers says. 
RMorris320: they don't want me, or you, for the last time
lrdmanhammer: Still, you can never be too careful.
RMorris320: *shrug* whatever
RMorris320: there's nothing they really need me for. :/
lrdmanhammer: Either way, you always have to keep watch. 
lrdmanhammer: Those bastards could want or need anything.
lrdmanhammer: And they could get it at anytime.
RMorris320: not with you around they couldn't!
lrdmanhammer: Hell no!
lrdmanhammer: That's why you should get here and then I can protect you. Nothing can get through our doors. :-) 
RMorris320: hey, thanks. that means a lot to me.
lrdmanhammer: ;-) Of course. Now get yourself ready for some fun! It's been too long since we've seen each other.
RMorris320: I know!!
RMorris320: it's going to be so much fun
lrdmanhammer: Can't wait. ;-)
RMorris320: hey, langly?
lrdmanhammer: Yea?
RMorris320: Um... I... I'm kind of mixed up about something
RMorris320: do you have to go right now, or do you have some time?
lrdmanhammer: ummm....well, we've got a few minutes before the paper has to be sent in for print. It won't make it out on time ir we don't. Something the matter?
RMorris320: I'm really scared, to tell you the truth
RMorris320: its about that boy of mulder and scully's
RMorris320: something bad is coming thier way.
lrdmanhammer: William? What about him?
lrdmanhammer: ?????
lrdmanhammer: Ruby, you're creeping me out a bit. What is going on?
RMorris320: I don't know, I just know that something bad is going to happen.
RMorris320: I'm sorry. I just can't shake the feeling. I think Gibson is aware of it too
RMorris320: I guess its nothing. I'll see you guys when I get there.
lrdmanhammer: Let's talk about this when you get here. 
lrdmanhammer: It might make more sense when I see you.
RMorris320: alright.
RMorris320: well, see you.
lrdmanhammer: See Ya.

DanasSpooky: Really?  You two were getting so close!
DanasSpooky: Am I gonna have to kick his butt for you?
RMorris320: no, don't do that!
RMorris320: we have been in touch a little bit
RMorris320: but I'm not supposed to talk about that
RMorris320: because forhike isn't suposed to know anything
RMorris320: frohike*
DanasSpooky: why the big secret?
RMorris320: well
RMorris320: frohike's jealous of us, or something
RMorris320: he likes to mess with us
RMorris320: :/
DanasSpooky: That's just how he is.
DanasSpooky: He teased Scully for *years*.
RMorris320: *laughing*
RMorris320: poor scully
RMorris320: I don't know, I really want to see him again, just between you and me
RMorris320: I miss him.
DanasSpooky: You should, then!  What's stopping you?
RMorris320: kevin, he wants me to stick arounf or a while. and also there's some stuff with mom's will I have to take care of and ugh its just a mess
DanasSpooky: langly has experience with that.  why isn't he there for you?
RMorris320: he's probably busy with work and stuff
DanasSpooky: they've never been *that* busy.
RMorris320: hah. I don't know why.
RMorris320: but we aren't REALLY anything right now. Not much more than friends.
RMorris320: I like him but I don't want to make the same mistake I usually do with guys
RMorris320: ...going too fast
DanasSpooky: Just don't make the other mistake.  
DanasSpooky: going too slow.
RMorris320: is that possible?
DanasSpooky: well, I guess things worked out all right for me and Scully in the end.
RMorris320: haha, I don't know *anything* about you and her relationship, but you guys definitely seem to be super compatible
DanasSpooky: we do, don't we?
DanasSpooky: but we *could* have had seven more years that we did.
RMorris320: seven years?!
DanasSpooky: *shrug* but don't come to *me* for relationship advice.
RMorris320: damn boy, how did you pull THAT one off?!!
DanasSpooky: good question.  *grin*
RMorris320: lol
RMorris320: I wonder how byers and suzanne are doing?
DanasSpooky: aren't they with the guys?
RMorris320: I know that byers is
RMorris320: I don't know if suzanne is too or not, though
RMorris320: I'm also wondering about bambi
RMorris320: she was acting pretty strangly when we left the convention
DanasSpooky: I've had other things on my mind since then.
DanasSpooky: Honestly,I expected Frohike to follow up on that.
RMorris320: yeah, that was odd
RMorris320: they were so into eachother. Ha ha.
RMorris320: me and Bambi were pretty good friends... I should try and get in touch with her
DanasSpooky: You should - her last entry seemed a little strange.
DanasSpooky: I have to go, someone needs a bedtime story.
DanasSpooky: :D
DanasSpooky: later.

"event","It's hard for me to see the screen well right now, because my tears are getting in the way and it makes everything look blurry until they stream down my face and make little wet spots on my jeans or sometimes the keyboard.

Um... I.. I don't know how to put this exactly, so I guess I'll just say it.

Mom's dead.

Here's the story from the beginning.

When I got home on the 5th I saw her that afternoon, and we got into a fight because of what had happened. After yelling at eachother she hit me, and I hit her back, and then we both went away and cried, and I stayed over night with a friend. The next morning I went home, and when I couldn't find her I thought she had just gone out, but then she didn't come back, and I got kind of worried. Of course, I was angry, so the two feelings combined and it wasn't exactly fun. Eventually I called the police and it got big in a hurry because she still wasn't back and no one could find her. I told Kevin, and he came back with Gibson. As soon as he could he marched right over to the TV and turned it on and sat there for about an hour, just looking into the static. He wouldn't let either me or Gibson get in the way. And that was the first time I have EVER seen my little brother cry since he was like, 3. He was angry. He ran outside and started screaming at the sky, asking why ""they"" wouldn't leave us alone. He knew she was dead. And Gibson knew as soon as Kevin knew, of course, and it was painful for all of us. It was like we were just waiting for them to find her.

So, almost 10 days later they called me on my cell phone, which I found in my room and I hadn't used it since the thing with that oil stuff so the battery was dying. They said I should come identify her body, which was the worst thing I have ever had to do.


Kevin is sitting in the corner, with his face totally neutral, and its really starting to freak me out. Gibson is somewhere else, happy to be away from us both and our thoughts.

More tears are running down my face right now, my makeup is TOTALLY ruined, as it has been for the past 10 days (I should just give up on trying to put it on), and I feel just horrible. I feel like it's my fault, and I hate myself for spending our last time together fighting.


Screw this, I can't type and cry at the same time."

RMorris320: Ooooooh. I'll get you for that one.
BlueBinaryBoy: whatever. anyway.
BlueBinaryBoy: Frohike says you've been too lovey with that blonde geek you're using for a boyfriend.
BlueBinaryBoy: If you've been harassing him, I'm going to get you.
RMorris320: Harassing him?
BlueBinaryBoy: you know what I mean.
RMorris320: actually, I don't....
BlueBinaryBoy: Let's just say you should probably lay off the kissing, and the googly eyes.
RMorris320: :o
RMorris320: what?!

RMorris320: we... what the....

BlueBinaryBoy: seriously though, ""ALMOST""?!

RMorris320: e_e

RMorris320: NO HE DIDN'T FEEL ME UP!!!!

BlueBinaryBoy: She isn't gonna believe you when you say some weird oil took ahold of your brain and made you go to Washington DC where you proceeded to squirt that sick black stuff all over this hippie dude who's face yer sucking now.
RMorris320: HEY! No more of that.
BlueBinaryBoy: Just making a point.

Frohike apparently like hates me or something. Wow, this is like, unhealthy! Geez. Its so stupid.

I really don't think this is fair. He's fine with Byers being with someone... why is it such a big deal with Langly?

Ugh. What a dumbffu.... Oh yeah, little brother's reading me. I forgot, I have to protect the innocent young ears. ^_^

Hahahaha, you know, I really should stop bugging Kevin about being little. Considering he's 19 and about a foot taller than I am, not to mention STRONGER... seriously. I can't go in to wake him up in the mornings anymore without risking being seriously injured. He'll be like unngggghhh............ And smack me across the room or something without any effort. O_O

Isn't it funny how I start off talking about one thing very seriously and then ending up joking around about something completely different?


Langly, for those of you who won't threaten to puke on me when I mention his name...*eyes move to Frohike*...has been his usual awesome self. He's the best ever. I love spending time with him. *happy sigh*

last person you hugged?: Ah... heh heh heh ^_~

last thing you laughed at?: Frohike! See first question.

last time you said 'i love you' and meant it?: Oh, God, don't ask me. I havn't said that in a long, long, time. Not even to Kevin, because he hates... *Gets an idea for the next time he picks on me and Langly* >:)

what's in your cd player right now?: I have no idea because its back at home...

what color socks are you wearing?: Not wearing any right now...I like bare feet ^_^

what's under your bed? Um, carpet? Dust? No idea.

what time did you wake up today? a little after nine.

current taste? nuthin'.

current hair? The usual. I've been putting my hair in braids lately though because it's been hot. Right now its down, and kinda messy.

current clothes? Ask Gibson!

current annoyance? Frohike bothering Langly, Langly bitching at Frohike. Hm, I believe I shall fix that. *turns around and tells 'em both to shut up*

current longing? To get these mean guys to stop making fun of me. :'( (Not a chance)

current desktop picture? Fro's desktop pic? *Bursts out laughing* a chick in a bikini with... a... computer? Thats just wrong. But funny. *Laughs at Frohike*

current worry?: I've got about 15,000 worrys that I have sucessfully managed to push into the back of my mind. I have other things to think about. Well, maybe not really *things* per se... maybe people. Hm. One person. :D

current hate? *glares at Kevin and Gibson through cyber space*

favorite physical feature of the opposite sex? This used to change like, every hour or two. (Shut up, I was NOT a slut!) Now I don't look so much into that stuff. But ya gotta admit, that Langly... ^_~ *sighs at the hair* Wait.. did I just type that?!

last cd you bought? I never buy my CDs. I know this guy who can get me bootleg copies for free. ^_-

if you could play an instrument what would it be? Blah, I like listening to music, but I'm kinda ADD so practicing an instrument or song isn't all that appealing to me.

favorite color? blue, pink and sometimes purple.

favorite person from your past: There was this kid I knew when I was 7 who was my friend. He moved away though and I never saw him again.

where would you like to go? I'm ashamed to say that I like it here much better then home, where I've lived all my life. But it's the truth, so I guess no where but here.

We met a woman named Bambi. (Wow, living in a town with lots of weird-ass bikers hanging out, I've heard some pretty strange names and nicknames. But honestly, what were this girls' parents THINKING?) I havn't seen much of her, except last night when she unexpectedly fell asleep on Frohike's bed. We girls have been slowly taking over these guys' room and its been kind of entertaining. Oh well, Byers has practically moved out of this room and into that Suzanne person's room, spending so much time with the woman. Frohike has to sleep on the floor because he's being polite to Bambi and I (because we're girls ;) ) and because Byers won't let him have Langly's bed since he's kinda still sick.

Everything is so quiet right now. It's amazing, I've almost forgotten what quiet is. So many people to talk to, three of which won't stop bugging me and Langly. Well, maybe four if you count Mulder, but he's not nearly as mean, and not very persistant, which is nice.

Nevermind about the quiet thing... Langly's snoring. (He's even adorable when he's making a huge racket and not even aware of it. *sigh*)

Big convo with Gibson. I think he posted it. ( O_O )

Frohike gave us both a knowing smirk when we announced where we were going. Langly told him he would kick his ass next time they got on the mat. O...k...? Whatever that means, I guess. ^_^

Langly's cold is almost gone now, though now that I'm reflecting upon our evening, probably walking to the coffee shop in the pouring rain wasn't such a smart plan. Oh well, Langly's a toughy and he'll be fine.

While there we just talked and all that. No, Kevin, we didn't do anything else. Cross my heart & hope to die we didn't. (You can ask Gibson.)


Speaking of Gibson, forget me keeping secrets from my brother about me and Langly... Gibson knows <u>everything</u>.

In fact, this happened just today.

Kevin: How's it going, lover girl?

Me: What?!

Kevin: (is grinning for ear to ear) c'mon Ruby, you can't hide this stuff from me. How's Langly?

Me: I don't know what you're talking about.

Kevin: sure you do.

Me: Langly and I are just friends!

Kevin: Thats not what Gibson says.

(Gibson now also has a big toothy grin stretched across his face)

I rolled my eyes and turned on the TV, but they kept bugging me about it, and then Frohike came in and started too. *Sigh* boys will be boys, I guess. Luckily they got distracted- Kevin and Gibson found something online that was interesting (something appropriate for such a young audience, I hope. ;P) and Frohike quit bugging me when Scully came in and told him not to pick on a girl. (He shut up RIGHT after that, heehee. Thanks, Scully.)


Looks like Byers found his woman. The details of this story I'm not clear on, but now Byers is all frantic to help her. Apparently she is infected with the same stuff I was.

I'm kinda tired. I think I'll go to bed now, even though its only about quarter after 11."

O_O

Now I'm all freaked out.


Langly seems to be getting considerably better. However, Byers still makes him sleep all the time. And me, I make him take his cough medicine. I'm not as bad as Byers is, but somehow whenever I insist he gulp that shit down he's much happier to do that then when Byers tells him to go to sleep. Hm.


Playing the motel room's Super Nintendo right now against him, actually. He's winning to the point that I don't even have a chance... but oh well, its fun anyway.

He's blushing AGAIN. Maybe his cold is making him do that or something. I don't know. Its still cute tho. ^_^

"event","Well, I was just going to try to get some more sleep, when, who should wake up, but Langly. He asked me what I was doing up this early. I told him I wasn't sure. I wasn't lying when I said that. I'm not usually a morning bird. I'm really more the type who's up all hours of the night and then sleeping until noon.

Anyway, we got to talking a little bit. Quietly, though, everyone else was still asleep and if Byers woke up he would totally get off on Langly for being awake when he was sick like this. (Byers is so silly. He really is like a mother to the poor guy.)

We talked about a lot of things. Small talk, mostly. Light was just starting to seep into the windows of the motel while we were doing so, and unless I'm mistaken, he was blushing big time. I mean, really, I didn't know if this guy's face was going to go through all the colors of the rainbow while we were sitting there chatting.

:D <3 <3 <3

If there is anything more cute in the world I'd like to know what it is right now.

Somehow we got onto the topic of UFOs and the like. I think I must have looked sad when he started talking about abductees because he looked at me so sympatheticly as he told me he knew I was one.

Then he looked at me again, and I sighed because I knew he wanted me to tell him about it.

So I did, and he listened intently throughout my entire story, and never laughed or asked me if I was actually serious. It felt odd to talk about it at all. I've never really said anything to anyone before on this topic, and it felt odd in doing so. I've only talked about it one other time, see, I got kinda drunk, and then they thought I was really, REALLY drunk after that. x_x;

After a bit it got it really fun to talk to him. I guess we got a little carried away. Eventually we both started laughing, and Byers got up and... well, long story short, that was the end of it. :'(

Byers is such a poop.

It is now about 8:30 and I can hear water running in the walls, a sure sign the world is starting to wake up. Or at least, the guests in this motel. Langly, however, poor thing, has to pretend to be asleep for at least a little while, or the sleep nazi will probably come bite his head off. Byers is on another computer, and Frohike is slouched on the other bed with the TV remote still in his hand. I can guess Kevin is doing the same right now.

Well, I just realized I'm still tired. Waking up at 6 AM and not being able to get back to sleep is really annoying... maybe I'll get in a little more shut-eye this time."

I had been watching TV when out of the corner of my eye I saw something... I looked over and there was a small slip of paper under the door. I walked over and read the words on it.

""Meet me in the lobby as soon as you can-- we need to talk""

Well, I was as confused as anyone would be. So I opened the door and looked out into the hall. No one was there, oddly enough. Inside my head I was debating with myself what I should do. Wake langly and tell him about it? No... he's sick and needs to sleep. The others wouldn't be back for a while, either. I considered just staying in the room and ignorning the note. But I'm not the type to listen to the side of me that has any common sense. So I left the room and went down the lobby. Aside from the man behind the counter there was only one person there. A woman. Blonde hair, and about my height.

She looked my way and came closer to me. She introduced herself as Marita Covarrubius, and told me she was looking for something but she needed my help.

Still confused, I asked her what she ment.

She then asked me if I knew anything about this black oil she had seen one of the men I'm with ask some people about.

I was definitely not expecting that question. I stared at her with curiosity, and she told me she needed to know anything I knew because she had to stop it.

I was about to open my mouth to say something when Frohike and Byers walked in the lobby. They came over and asked me what was going on, and Marita introduced herself to them too. Well, long story short, they found out this was someone they had been expecting to find (I think) and they took her back to the room where they all talked and asked questions and then she left. I'm still not entirely clear on what this is all about...


Anyway.

I talked to Kevin and he says he's coming here tomorrow! (mom isn't though. I didn't get the detales on why that is...) But I'm really excited! I miss him. :(

""Oh, mom, I can't come home because I was just infected with an alien virus and those two FBI agents you met a really long time ago want to make sure I'm ok."" So I just told he that it was really important that I stay here. I didn't tell her why.

Last night was interesting. I spent it talking to Mulder and my friend Jen back in IA. Jen was very happy I was ok, and she filled me in on the few things that had happened in Sioux City since I've been gone. Mulder spent most of the convo bikering at Langly, who TOTALLY won. ;)

Speaking of Langly, for someone who's about five years older then me, I really like him. He makes me laugh. More on that later, though. And I'm not saying anything I can't take back later. :)

Frohike won't stop making fun of us. I just had to give him my best ""not amused"" look. I think he got the idea, because he's not bothering us now. (I think thats only temporary though... later he'll be back on us for apparently being discovered knocked out on the floor together. Hah. ^_^;)

Its me this time. Not my little brother, who I've just found out has been writing in my journal. I feel really bad right now. I guess both physically and emotionally. I've made my family think I was dead. I don't know if this has happened to any of you. But I do know that it hurts, especially when you can't walk in the door and end their pain just yet. And I'm hundreds of miles away from Iowa and I really don't know what I'm doing here or why I'm sitting at a computer updating my journal and not trying to contact my family or something. Physically, becasue I feel like I have a really bad hangover. I don't know what happened to me, but according to this guy I've just met...

Ok, wait, lets backup.

I'm going to start from the beginning. Not for you, but for me. Maybe I'll understand exactly what has happened if I do.

I went to confront Tessa, what seems like yesterday, but what is apparently quite a while ago. Something happened... she died. I remember how but I really don't feel like talking about that. Just before she died she said, ""And this is for you, my friend."" Then she said something in a weird language and ... died. Then I don't know what happened. Her blood was all over me, but so was this really sick black stuff, with the texture of grease. Then it started to move around and GET UNDER MY DAMN SKIN and it felt really, really sick. I thought I was going to die. That's the last thing I remember.

Then I woke up. For a moment I really thought I was dead. I saw a bright light... And then a face looking down at me. Fear-stricken, I panicked... I thought they had taken me again.

But then when they spoke in english and my eyes started to adjust I found out I was alive and that this was a person and, nither one of the people who took me those many years ago, nor was he an angel or something and I knew I wasn't dead.

He said his name was ... Langley or something. I was too out of it to render anything he said properly. And I think I was crying. I don't know. All I know is that I think I passed out again because I woke up a few hours ago and the man was still there, working on his computer.

When he saw I was awake he asked me if I was ok. Whenever people ask me that after something weird happens to me I always say yes, but in my head I always think they are such idiots because, look at me, I just woke up under the weirdest circumstances and how could I be ok?

We got to talking and he turned out to be a pretty cool guy. I asked a lot of questions but didn't get a lot of answers. He wasn't hiding anything. He just didn't know. We talked about a lot of other stuff though. Conversation was kind of fun... it calmed my nerves.

I really like him.

But I'm afraid that if he finds out that I believe that I've been abducted by aliens he'll think I'm an escapee from a mental insistution. (If he doesn't already... )

I'm updating on his computer now. He and two other men are playing cards and talking amung themselves. They're quiet and I can't hear them and it's making me uncomfortable.

"event","Mom is making me see a psyciatrist for my depression. The lady who is now trying to help me with this says that the best way to deal with loss is to write about it. So here, I've written:

You were my friend to bring me laughs,
You were there when I shed a tear,
You were my shoulder to cry on,
You were there through my pain and fear.

I remember you were so fun to be around,
Making each day seem fresh and new,
I can't beleive you're gone now,
I can't beleive it's true

But it is- you're gone from my grasp,
Now you're away from this world,
Now I don't know what is left to do,
My God, I miss you girl.

You're in a better place now,
And I'm here left to cry,
Because I just can't figure it out-
Why did he kill you? Why did you have to die?

I miss you and I love you Sam,
I just wanted you to know,
You will always be in my heart,
No matter where, in life, I go.

<i>Dedicated with love to Sam Miller, the best friend a person could ever have.</i>"

"event","So I guess you probably read about what's been going on in my life recently from Mulder's posts... I feel horrible. I want to curl up into a little ball and never be noticed by anyone again, so I can simply be left to my solitude.

That never happens though. But I havn't updated to explain my misery, I've updated to give you some EXTREMLY important info regarding Gibson:


Kevin says that Gibson is not responding to his messages, but that he's alive. That means he's unconcious or something. Whatever it is, we're running out of time. But I have good news: he has a way to find where Gibson is! (We can't believe he hadn't thought of this before)

Because Gibson is still alive, he's still sending brainwaves - just not the kind Kevin can interperate as a message. Anyway, he can, with his mind, listen to them, and then find nearby sources of things transmitting data or whtever into the air. He's found a nearby cellphone tower, and knows where it is.

According to Kevin.... Gibson's somewhere in Mexico, near the border of Texas."

"event","I saw Kevin, at the hospital this morning. He's white as a sheet, but the doctors say they're surprised that he's recovering as fast as he is. And they also say he had a sezure from looking at the computer screen, and thats what happened.

One word:

<b>HA!</b>

Kevin didn't have a sezure. I was there. I saw it. I <i>saw</i> it! Gibson was in his head. Apparently Gibson is a hell of a lot stronger than I thought, being able to posess Kevin like that. (But only for a short while).

Mom came home early because of Kevin... She was at some convention thing for her volenteer work at the museum. She was to be there until today. But when she came back, she just ran to me and hugged me and then we went to see Kevin. I told her everything that happened again, then the doctor gave her his account of it, and then she pulled me aside and spoke to be quietly. She knew there was more to the story than him having a sezure because of the computer screen... she knew it was different. So I told her the whole story (the real one), and she gave me a knowing glance, but told me not to tell anyone about it. She doesn't want people to think we're any weirder than we are already.

Well, my computer is being snobby so I'm going to go."

"event","OH MY GOD SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH KEVIN!!!!!!

HE'S STARTED SCREAMING AND THEN HE STARTED ACTING LIKE .... LIKE THAT GIBSON BOY!!!!!

I had to call 9-1-1 because my mom is away for a day, and he was unconcious and I didn't know what to do! The paramedics came and took him away! 

I'm here in the hospital on my friends cell phone using the internet... Handy little thing.

I called mom a minute ago and told her that Kevin was sick. (Didn't tell her what I think really happened though, she doesn't like stuff like that), and so she's on her way.

Oh god, my hands are shaking.

AND OH. MY. GOD.

THIS IS CREEPY. I WAS LOOKING OVER THE CONVERSATION THAT KEVIN/GIBSON HAD WITH THAT MAN, AND GIBSON DESCRIBED AN UGLY OLD MAN WITH A GIGARETTE... AND I KNOW WHO HE IS.

He's here. In Sioux City! But... He's also there on the train with Gibson?

Oh never mind, I probably made a mistake.


Urg....(Sarcasm) This was the best birthday ever....."

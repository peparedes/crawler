"event","so, my library got broken into this past saturday before we opened.  the perpetrator clearly did not do any recon before they decided to attempt this, as all of our computers are literally on lockdown.  so, when the police got there a few of the computers were in disarray, but still fine, and our staff microwave was missing.  guess the guy had to make off with something to make it worth it.
le sigh."

i haven't been checking any of my websites lately because the backlight on my laptop decided to die.&nbsp; this means that my computer screen is completely black while the computer itself is still functioning.&nbsp; got me an S-Video cable hooked up from my laptop to my tv, so i can see what i'm doing, but the type shows up tiny as fuck.&nbsp; quite annoying, really.&nbsp; a backlight replacement would be too much time and money for this old of a computer, so i'm sort of stuck right now.&nbsp; trying to butter up daddy to buy me a 15&quot; macbook pro.&nbsp; we'll see how that goes...

vacation time is nearing and i'm doing it big.&nbsp; leaving next thursday to go to the beach for 4 days with a few friends.&nbsp; found a cheap condo on the beach.&nbsp; it's gonna be good to get out of this town for a little while.&nbsp; two weeks after i get back from the beach, i'll be driving my ass up to chicago for lolla.&nbsp; seriously looking forward to that!&nbsp; not only am i gonna be able to catch up with allison and brooke, but i'm also gonna have quite a few friends coming with me.&nbsp; among them will be kevin, peter, and lindsey.&nbsp; hurray!&nbsp; ashton and i are gonna drive up to chicago a day early so that we can have some time to roam in the city before the concert madness begins.&nbsp; preliminary ideas of what to do with this time: six flags or a segway tour of the city.&nbsp; on the must list is DAVE AND BUSTERS!&nbsp; then, two weeks after i get back from lolla, i'm going to the beach with my family for a week.&nbsp; unfortunately, immediately following that, i will enter my final semester of college.&nbsp; 2 more classes and i'll have my degree in hand.&nbsp; it'll be a major relief, but i'm sure i'll miss it once it's gone.&nbsp; 

in other news, i'm completely enamored with ashton.&nbsp; i've never known a single person that makes me smile as much as this kid does.&nbsp; we've been together for nearly 8 months now and i feel as if it's been longer.&nbsp; the amount of awesome trips we've taken and bands we've seen together... i love that kid.&nbsp; i really do.&nbsp; 

i know i don't update often, so i apologize if this startled you.&nbsp; just felt like jotting a few things down.

goodnight, children.

PS - sorry if any words are mangled horribly.&nbsp; i really can't see shit on this thing.&nbsp; ;-)
oh, and i really disliked harry potter and the half-blood prince movie.&nbsp; left out too many VERY important scenes/details, imo.&nbsp; *pushes up nerd glasses*"

long time, no post.&nbsp; jeeze lj... way to be a friend!&nbsp; :-P

life is good.&nbsp; lots has happened since the last time i posted, of course.
high points: 
brooke and allison came to visit for mardi gras
i gots myself a boyfriend.&nbsp; he's awesome.
been to a multitude of great concerts.

yeah... that's about it.
there seems to be some demand for an AFP gig review.&nbsp; so, here we go...&nbsp; are you ready?&nbsp; are you sure?&nbsp; keep all hands and arms inside the lj vehicle at all times.&nbsp; and........... offffffffff...............weeeeeeeeeeee.............goooooooooooooo!

.... almost

ok...
for real now...

drove to NOLA for the amanda palmer gig last sunday.&nbsp; ashton came with me.&nbsp; 
we felt completely out of place standing in line.&nbsp; we were neither gay or dressed up with crazy hair.&nbsp; we had our tickets, but we noticed the people behind us in line still needed to purchase theirs.&nbsp; so, when i got the twitter text update from amanda saying it was time for free ticket contest, i quickly responded.&nbsp; figured i'd save these people a few dollars.&nbsp; i won.&nbsp; gave them our tickets and got in on the guest list.&nbsp; resulting in one of the most awesome things i've ever said in my life; &quot;we're on amanda's guest list.&quot;&nbsp; awesome.&nbsp; i could say it all day, really.&nbsp; 
got inside the venue and had a seat in chairs lining the walls.&nbsp; the tickets that we gave to the people behind us were commemorative tickets, which you got to keep.&nbsp; so, we requested that the people we gave them to return them after they got inside.&nbsp; they did.&nbsp; except one of the party had forgotten her i.d., so they wouldn't let her in.&nbsp; :-/&nbsp; c'est la vie.
vermillion lies came on stage.&nbsp; i'd heard their music before.&nbsp; they were highly entertaining.&nbsp; recommended.&nbsp; finally, amanda came on stage; swigging a bottle of wine on the way.&nbsp; (11)&nbsp; she sat down and didn't say anything for a while.&nbsp; the audience was eerily quiet.&nbsp; all you could hear was the cash register at the bar.&nbsp; she appreciated our respectfulness since, apparently, the night before in houston had a few assholes in the crowd.&nbsp; so, she cried about our quietness.&nbsp; so, somebody yelled 'we love you, amanda' which prompted her to burst into tears.&nbsp; quite strange to see a performer crying on stage.&nbsp; very open and honest.&nbsp; there wasn't a curfew for the gig because (a) it was new orleans and (b) since the bar was 2 blocks from bourbon street, it didn't close until 5am.&nbsp; amanda utilized this advantage.&nbsp; she drank nearly 2 bottles of wine by herself.&nbsp; cried after nearly every slow song.&nbsp; it was beautiful.&nbsp; she talked and talked and talked.&nbsp; couldn't shut her up if you'd tried.&nbsp; she spoke of the last week before she and brian called the dresden dolls off for a bit.&nbsp; she spoke of her love for ben folds and her days as a street performer.&nbsp; she played and played and played.&nbsp; astronaut, ampersand, runs in the family, leeds united, oasis, the point of it all, i google you, missed me, half jack, sex changes, mrs o, and some others that were covers that i didn't recognize.&nbsp; encore was creep on uke ending in a final stand on the bar.&nbsp; she left after that with the promise that she would come out to sign and take pictures.&nbsp; this was not enough for our audience.&nbsp; we kept cheering.&nbsp; so, she returned to the stage with a container of guacamole in her hand; eating and saying, &quot;i thought that was the encore.&nbsp; i guess not.&quot;&nbsp; so, she sat down and played us two more songs; requests from the audience (leeds united and missed me).&nbsp; glad to get those.&nbsp; concert ended around 1:30.&nbsp; waited in line to get our tickets signed.&nbsp; didn't really say anything to amanda, other than, 'thanks, that was a great show.'&nbsp; to be honest, she was quite sloshed after nearly 2 bottles of wine so having a conversation with her probably would've yielded mumbles and craziness.&nbsp; got ashton hope for 3am.&nbsp; just in time to get 2 hours of sleep before having to be to work at 5:30!&nbsp; i was much lucker, as i had nothing to do the next day.&nbsp; 
all in all, a fantastical show.
hope this post satiated your needs.&nbsp; i'll try not to leave such a gap in posts in the future.

regards,
mel"

i said, 
""i had this crazy dream a few nights ago that i think you'll appreciate. i was just getting home from work and i see through the kitchen window that you are robbing my roommate and her boyfriend. instead of running away before you saw me and calling the cops, i walked inside, gathered up all of my most valuable possessions and handed them to you willingly. you were very grateful and left peacefully. it was very puzzling and unexpected.""

"event","i arrived and sat down in the line that already consisted of 3 young girls. a few of the workers from the venue were standing outside talking to them. they're talking about how many times they've seen Ben. for most of the girls, this will be their second. i said, in an off handed way, ""twice? that's it? pssh.. this is 8 for me."" one of the workers looks over at me and says, ""what's your name?"" me: melissa lamb. him: i recognize you from facebook. awesome! then, the girl sitting next to me in line asks if i have a lastfm. she recognizes me from there. (i think i've been hanging out with weiner too long) anyway, i tell them that i've seen him 8 times and i drove 12 hours one time. the worker just hands me something that appears to be a laminated flier. i inquired as to what it was. he turns it over for me and i read that i have just won a backstage meet and greet with Ben. well, that was unexpected, but fantastical. 
 
 anyway, eef was fantastic, as always. he mentioned that he had a few 'advanced copies' of his cd Lose Big for sale at the merch table. unfortunately, i had no cash and the merch table closed early. booo! i want that cd!!
 
 Ben came out.  he must've been in a cursing mood.  he replaced quite a few lyrics with curse words.
 set list:
 Errant Dog ft. tambo man
 Gone
 Landed ft. tambo man
 You To Thank
 Free Coffee - extended solo at the end
 Hiroshima - replace 'oh my god' with 'oh my fucking god'
 Still Fighting It
 Effington ft. tambo man - replace 'start a new life...' with 'get a tambourine and play it'
 Losing Lisa
 Zak and Sara
 Philosophy -&gt; Inc. Misirlou
 Brick
 - SOLO -
 Lullabye
 Gracie
 The Luckiest
 - Back With Band -
 Bitches Ain't Shit - extended jam
 Freebird jam session
 Narcolepsy
 Kate
 Hava Nagila (out of nowhere, loved it)
 Rockin' the Suburbs
 Improv - Ben started playing some sort of flowy solo. he looked at sam halfway through and commented how shitty it was. started saying how some people make good money playing piano like that, but they're actually good at it. then, he tentatively nicknamed the song, ""Flowing Waters of Shit Creek""
 Underground - replace 'get down' with 'shit yeah' - i was the only one in the audience who yelled, ""who the fuck are you?"" apparently, people had never heard it because it got a lot of laughs. then, Jared stared right at me and gave me the finger. Grin i just gave him the 'what, i had to!' face.
 - Encore -
 Annie Waits
 Army
 
 a few more notes--
 - at one point, at the back of the audience, they got a chant going. half the people would yell BEN, while the other half followed with FOLDS. Ben couldn't figure out what they were saying, so he went into a short little diddy much like the RTB in Berlin (at least i think it was berlin, you know what i'm talking about...). a few songs later, he says, ""i really wanna know what they were yelling."" so, he walks to the front of the stage, kneels down right in front of lindsey and i and asks us. he finally understands and says, ""hey, that's me!"" ha. so, the crowd starts chanting again and Ben promptly adds in the word 'Sucks.'
 - the album is for sure coming out in September.  he said it with mass amounts of confidence.
 - some proposed titles made up by Ben on the spot were ""No Jacket Required"", ""Duets"", and ""Kiss My Fucking Ass."" 
 
 that's about all i've got for you children. i did have to watch the encore from backstage in order to meet Ben after. it took him forever to come around and take a picture with the group of us. apparently, he found a basketball and wouldn't stop playing. one of the workers had to steal the ball from him. lol so, he came around, took a few group pictures. got a single picture with him. it's very myspacey, as i took the picture. turned out pretty well. i'll get the e-mail with the group picture tomorrow.
 Ben did stick around after the show. he was headed straight to the bus, but saw a few fans still waiting, so he veered and made the effort to meet them/take pictures/give autographs. so, yay for that! i didn't get a chance to really talk to him though. :-/ i was gonna ask about whether he's going to possibly be touring with Kweller or AP, since the album releases are in sync. shucks! didn't even get to see Sam and Jared. they were already in the bus when i came out from backstage. 
 
 all in all, it was a fantastic show.  Ben was in great spirits.  probably the happiest i've seen him.  ever.

see my icon for my single picture with Ben.  ...and...

...and i've just purchased a ticket to see Ben May 28 in Vienna, VA.  brooke and allison are flying into new orleans, where i will pick them up and we'll road trip to virginia to see Ben.  from there, we'll go to north carolina to see The Old Ceremony, Snuzz, Steve, and (my personal favorite) Chuck!!!  yays!"

"event","From getting a private concert from Snuzz, to being offered a lap dance by Chuck, to laughing about ridiculous commercials with Allison and Brooke, I really couldn't have asked for a better trip.<br /><br /><b>Day One (December 26)</b><br />the day started out super early.&nbsp; i managed to get two hours of sleep (3-5 AM) before having to leave for the New Orleans airport.&nbsp; lucky for me, i have this amazing friend named Bucky, who was kind enough to take my ass to New Orleans at buttfuck early in the morning.&nbsp; sat around the New Orleans airport for a few hours before boarding my flight to Atlanta.&nbsp; spent a few hours at the Atlanta airport layover before catching a flight to Raleigh, North Carolina.&nbsp; upon arriving, i ran around the airport frantically trying to find the way out.&nbsp; eventually, i made my way to where Allison and Brooke were.&nbsp; headed to the hotel and chilled for a while.&nbsp; it was good to hang out with them some.&nbsp; i think i had the best time just making fun of Brooke's accent.&nbsp; silly northerners!&nbsp; the best was the way that they both pronounced Raleigh.&nbsp; they pronounced it 'rally'.&nbsp; hahaha.&nbsp; i made Chuck get onto them about that later.&nbsp; anyway, ended up eating dinner at a rib joint called Oh! Brian's.&nbsp; stopped by the ABC Liquor Store and bought some raspberry vodka and sprite.&nbsp; ended up having a few drinks and watching the World's Strongest Man Competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; that shit is addicting.&nbsp; couldn't have stopped watching if i wanted to.<br /><br /><b>Day Two (December 27)<br /></b>we spent this one in Chapel Hill, down by...<br />Rosemary <a href=""http://tinypic.com"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i18.tinypic.com/6ode6bq.jpg"" alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" /></a><br />and <br />Cameron <a href=""http://tinypic.com"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i15.tinypic.com/85au63l.jpg"" alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" /></a><br />we couldn't help ourselves.&nbsp; it was a point of interest as Ben Folds mentions both streets in the song Kate.&nbsp; funnily enough, the two streets run parallel despite what Ben says.<br />spent a few more hours in the hotel before deciding to head into downtown for some dinner.&nbsp; we ate at a tiny place called Armadillo Grill.&nbsp; good food for real cheap.&nbsp; just the way i like it!&nbsp; <a href=""http://tinypic.com"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i7.tinypic.com/6stc20g.jpg"" alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" /></a><br />after eating, we realized that we still had a few hours until Chuck Folds Five was scheduled to play a few doors down.&nbsp;

had a martini and a few glasses of wine.&nbsp; Chuck's band started playing.&nbsp; halfway through their first set, he pointed out the three of us and claimed to have heard us requesting some Britney Spears.&nbsp; told the rest of the audience that ""if we had a problem with the song choice to blame us"".&nbsp; needless to say, i got some of the nastiest looks from old women that i've ever gotten in that moment.&nbsp; when their first set was over, all three of the members headed over to us at the bar and we had a nice little chat.&nbsp; introduced our selves and what not.&nbsp; told Chuck that i really liked their rap covers.&nbsp; those were my favorite.&nbsp; requested Baby Got Back as a joke.&nbsp; the boys got back on stage for their second set.&nbsp; lowandbehold, their first song was a medley of rap songs culminating in none other than Baby Got Back.&nbsp; let me tell you, that white boy can rap.&nbsp; halfway through that set, Chuck called me on stage and sang a love song to me.&nbsp; it was sweet.&nbsp; he looks so much like Ben, it's ridiculous.&nbsp; btw, for those of you not in the know, Chuck is Ben's little brother.&nbsp; anyway, the bar kicked everybody out, including the band.&nbsp; as we were saying our goodbyes, Chuck and Tim decided that they wanted some food at the bar across the way was still open.&nbsp; so, we went there and had another drink and some food.&nbsp; talked to Chuck a lot there.&nbsp; he gave me career advice.&nbsp; we talked about artists we love like Springsteen and Elliott Smith, etc.&nbsp; i paid for his beer and my drink.&nbsp; then, he offered me a lap dance for a dollar.&nbsp; i denied him because i only had a 5 and i didn't feel like tipping him 4 dollars.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; rolled out of that bar around 2 or so.&nbsp;

Snuzz is a solo musician.&nbsp; he played bass for Ben during the Rockin' the Suburbs tour.&nbsp; he was also in the short-lived band, International Orange, with Robert Sledge.&nbsp; he's a great musician and a great guy.&nbsp; since he didn't have any gig dates scheduled during our stay in North Carolina, he invited us to his house for a private gig.&nbsp; he's a super sweet guy.&nbsp; his cat, Burden, is fucking adorable.&nbsp; he ended up serving us cheese and crackers.&nbsp; played two new songs for us, as well as one of my favorites, Eddie.&nbsp; we decided as a group to create the new trend of t-shorts.&nbsp; basically overalls but, with the t-shirt underneath attached.&nbsp;

the show was phenomenal.  the only downfalls... my camera ran out of batteries halfway through that video of Lizzy.  so, i didn't get many pictures.  also, it was an all ages show.  :-(
and, the opener was 'interesting' to say the least.  Kweller didn't make an appearance after the performance.  :-(
so, i've seen Folds twice and Kweller once now and i have still yet to meet a Ben.  but, my time will come... at least it better!  :-D"

"event","went to see Coheed and Cambria tonight with Brandon.&nbsp; they were opening up for Killswitch Engage at The Sugar Mill in NOLA.&nbsp; <br /><br />arrived at the venue for 8.&nbsp; some crappy local band was just finishing up their set.&nbsp; the place was packed.<br /><br />Coheed came on stage and the whole place was alive.&nbsp; the first half of their set, they stuck to their old album, which i love.&nbsp; that album just reminds me of younger days.&nbsp; good memories.&nbsp; the sound was a little off for the first few songs, but they cleared it up and continued to rock out.&nbsp; couldn't really see much though.&nbsp; some 6'4"" man decided to stand right in front of me right before the band came out.&nbsp; so, i had a lovely view of this gentleman's shoulder blades for the first few songs.&nbsp; managed to squeeze my way further into the crowd for a better look.&nbsp; the setlist was perfection.&nbsp; the sound was alright.&nbsp; the energy was great.&nbsp; all in all, it was a good show.&nbsp; could've been better, but it could've been a hell of alot worse.<br /><br />i enjoyed the fact that half the people left after Coheed finished their set.&nbsp; headliner, who?&nbsp; lol<br />but, alas, i was forced to stick around because they're one of Brandon's favorite bands.<br />i let him mosh and what not.&nbsp; i walked outside and befriended a 35 year old lady from TN.&nbsp; hey, why not?!&nbsp; we were in the same situation.&nbsp; her daughter was inside and she couldn't stand the music any longer.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/urhardcoreness1/pic/000017k4/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/urhardcoreness1/pic/000017k4/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />anyway, that's pretty much the only good picture i got.&nbsp; there were far too many tall fuckers in front of me.&nbsp; :-/<br /><br />fun stuff anyway.<br /><br />up next...

"event","that, i have to say, was one of the single greatest experiences of my life.
The Polyphonic Spree are love.

their opener, Jesca Hoop, reminded me alot of regina spektor.&nbsp; ....except with guitar instead of piano.&nbsp; i wasn't really feeling her.
but, when PS came on, all bets were off.&nbsp; there was a red sheet pulled all the way across the stage about 6 feet high.&nbsp; opening bars of a song began to play and you see some scissors begin to cut a whole in the sheet.&nbsp; the scissors cut a whole the shape of a heart in it.&nbsp; then, the sheet falls and you see all of the band members.

they played a few songs from the Beginnings.&nbsp; a few more from Together We're Heavy and alot from Fragile Army.&nbsp; they even played a few from their Wait EP.&nbsp;&nbsp; from what i remember (because i never take down setlists) they played It's The Sun, La La, Run Away, Get Up and Go, The Fragile Army, Younger Yesterday, We Crawl, Watch Us Explode (Justify), The Championship, Hold Me Now, When the Fool Becomes a King, Everything Starts at the Seam, Lithium, and I'm Calling.&nbsp; 

personal favorites were It's the Sun, Hold Me Now, When the Fool Becomes a King, and Lithium.&nbsp; during Lithium, the lead singer came down into the audience and started a quasi-moshpit.&nbsp; being right there, i had to join in.&nbsp; 

there was an encore.&nbsp; they all left the stage just long enough for them to change into their robes from their jumpsuits.&nbsp;&nbsp; came back on stage and played for at least another 30 minutes.

after their set, everybody just couldn't stop clapping and screaming.&nbsp; it brought the flute player to tears.&nbsp; :-)

ahhh, i can't stop smiling.&nbsp; their joy is contagious.&nbsp; 

i might have to edit this in the morning to make it more coherent.

next post... pictures."

he's playing at the Parish inside the House of Blues.&nbsp; 
i'm fucking excited!
tickets are 18.50 if you buy them through Kweller's website.
btw, if you don't know...The Parish can only hold about 100 people.&nbsp; so, it's going to be seriously intimate.

"event","allison wants a review, so it's a review i will give her!<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Concert Review and Photos"">got out of my accounting final late. after a bought with traffic, we (jessica and i) arrived in NOLA at 6:30.<br /><br />just in time to see The Cinematics! YAY! i'd just like to say that the lead singer and lead guitarist are very, very hott. mmm... apparently, i was the only person in the audience who knew who they were and i was standing on the front row. the guitarist kept seeing me singing along and smiling at me. ;-) what a cutey! i snapped a picture of him with my phone. so, from what i can remember...they played Race To The City, Break, Human, Chase, Sunday Sun, Keep Forgetting, Maybe Someday, and Asleep At The Wheel. i was quite surprised at how long they played. it was pleasant.<br /><br />http://i12.tinypic.com/4r0jlsh.jpg<br />handsome guitarist<br /><br />http://i19.tinypic.com/4ktihxy.jpg<br />hott lead singer<br /><br />after the cinematics, i ran upstairs to use the restroom. i was standing upstairs and when i turned around, i ran into a guy. he saw my Folds shirt and commented that there ""weren't many of them around"" and ""nice choice. he's the master of the keys."" so, i told him that i drove to Illinois to see him. he called me crazy. i introduced myself. he introduced himself as Darren and it dawned on me that he was indeed the drummer for Mute Math. :-D we didn't get to talk for long though before he was whisked away.<br /><br />next up...Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin. i was really looking forward to them and they delivered. they were a bunch of nerds and i wouldn't have had it any other way. got a couple pics of them. i was (once again) the only one in the crowd who knew who they were, so i got more smiles from the band. halfway through their set, the members swapped places. the lead singer/guitarist went to playing bass. the bass player headed to the drums and the drummer took over lead vocals and guitar. it was pretty sweet. i wasn't expecting that. so, i guess the rhythm guitarist was feeling left out, so he walked around the stage on his hands in the middle of a song at one point. it was silly. from memory...they played Pangea, I Am Warm and Powerful, Travel Song, Oregon Girl, House Fire, Anna Lee, and Anne Elephant. for their last song, the guys from The Cinematics came back out and they covered Arrested Development's ""Mr. Wendel."" that was humorous. two indie bands covering a rap song. kind of makes me think of another man i know... :-P<br /><br />http://i16.tinypic.com/6aessjs.jpg<br />second lead singer and drummer<br /><br />all through the first two sets, there was a couple standing front and center. now, this show was all ages. therefore, it was no smoking and they weren't selling any alcohol. well, this couple in the front (who were obviously drunk and/or high) kept making out. PDA is just plain rude if you ask me. they weren't just making out either. he was giving her hickies, etc. they were smoking too. the security guard caught the guy and told him to put it out and threatened to kick him out. so, the guy quit, but the girl kept sneaking cigarettes. (we'll get back to these two in a few paragraphs. they'll become relevent.)<br /><br />the main event...Mute Math! they were glorious. i had no idea of their stage energy. they were all over the place! they set up Paul's keyboard and mic to the right of me at the very front of the stage. the only bad thing about this...it was totally in the way of me seeing the drummer. that's ok though. i mean, paul is pretty much the main attraction anyway! :-) they started off high energy and it stayed that way throughout. in the middle of one of the first songs, Paul saw a cup on the front of the stage that belonged to the couple from before. he grabbed it and took a sip from it. spit most of it out and placed the cup back down before continuing to dance uncontrollably. toward the middle of their set, the guy from the couple decides it's a good idea to start waving around an almost empty bottle of whiskey that he had managed to sneak in. security caught him and kicked him out. at least, we thought they did. but noooooo....he was back at her side making out once more 10 minutes later. then, the security guard came and confiscated the cups they had. (they had bought cokes and poured the whiskey into them) so, that's why Paul spit out the sip that he took. i guess he wasn't quite expecting whiskey. lol. during one of the songs, they pulled out an upright bass. another time, the band had a drum jam together. each of them got a drumstick and started tapping on something nearby. Paul decided to do gymnastics using his keyboard as a prop. he did carwheels and mostly just rolled on top of it. decided to try a backflip over it. ended up stumbling on the landing and falling into the audience. guess who right there to catch him. ME! he gave me a hug that lasted for a good while and told me sorry. it was cute. after their ""last"" song, the drummer slammed his drums on the ground, breaking his drum kit. apparently, he didn't know they were going to do an encore. because they came back for the encore and one of the roadies was having to duck tape his drums back together. lol. they had mentioned before that this show was their last of the tour. so, after the encore, the whole band began trashing the place. the drummer (Darren) threw his drums at the lights set up at the back of the stage. the guitarist threw his guitar down. paul took the wooden cover off of the top of his keyboard and broke the rest of the lights with it. mass destruction! CHAOS, if you will. so, once again...from what i remember...Collapse, Typical, Chaos, Noticed, Without It, Polite, Stare At The Sun, Obsolete, Break The Same, You Are Mine, Control, and Reset. there were a few others i didn't quite recognize. i don't know Reset (EP) very well though. they could've been off of there.<br /><br />http://i13.tinypic.com/62edhqv.jpg<br />Paul and his keytar<br /><br />http://i18.tinypic.com/4z1f2pf.jpg<br />upright bass!<br /><br />http://i15.tinypic.com/4lzu3q8.jpg<br />guitarist<br /><br />http://i12.tinypic.com/4umy4hy.jpg<br />Darren's drum solo on top of the keyboard<br /><br />i wanted to stay to meet the rest of the boys, but they ran away in a limo right after the show. they didn't even have their tour bus there since NOLA is their hometown. plus, they had mentioned that some of their friends and family were there. so, i guess they went to hang out with them. :-(<br /><br />all in all, an awesome show! definitely worth my 15 bucks.<br /><br />plus, in the girl's bathroom, they had a The Rapture/Shiny Toy Guns poster stapled up promoting next week's show. i nabbed it. it's pretty sweet. hanging in my living room right now with tickets attached to it. :-D<br /></lj-cut>"

EDIT:&nbsp; my aunt called me and said after a bit of convincing, her boss let her take off of work.&nbsp; YAYS!&nbsp; she also said that she was going to pay for our hotel room because she doesn't want us staying in a motel 6.&nbsp; tell me i don't have the coolest family ever.&nbsp; i dare you!"

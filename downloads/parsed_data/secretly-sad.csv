"event","this is kind of a plea, but im looking for anyone who i can talk to about finding out you are pregnant. 

Long story short:
I found out 2days ago that i am pregnant at the age of 19. It is not a planned pregnancy and came as a horrible shock to me, the condom split and we didn't find out until 3days later- too late to take the pill i did a test when it happened (4weeks ago) and it came back negative so all was forgotten, until i never came on...turns out i was pregnant but it was too early to show.

I have told 2 friends who are being so unbelievably supportive but neither of which are at uni with me, both my parents know and are being so understanding and supportive too, its great but i am yet to tell my other half. If you have to put a label on us we are seeing each other and have been for 2months but were not ""officially"" together. 

I need some advice on how to tell him and whether or not to?! he has a lot of exams at the moment which are over in a couple of days so if i tell him it will be after them but then im also scared i may loose him if he does find out. Also i have made a decision on what i want to do with the baby but i am starting to feel like it might be the wrong choice and although i have some great support already none of them really know what it is i am going through and i dont feel i can keep discussing it all with them.

I would really appreciate it if there is anyone out there male or female who could help me.
I'm feeling really lost and pretty terrified at the moment.

Thanks.

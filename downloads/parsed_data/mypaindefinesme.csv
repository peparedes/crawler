"event","""too much drama"".. thats what she said. But you said she said something she didnt say at all.  So where do i stand on the topic? I dont stand. I sit. Sometimes cross legged.. this is my most painful and childlike position. When i do stand, i get the feeling that sitting was a better choice after all.  The strain of sitting was enough, like sitting through all 16 hours of titanic in a movie theater... my butt is sore, i contain absolutely no meat. There are some things worth standing for, this is not one of them.

"event","i find it really annoying that i have to kick my mini fridge so that it stops making really annoying noises.  I find myself doing so several times an hour when in my room... and countless times when trying to sleep.  Although when in bed, it's not so much kicking, but throwing a very heavy math or macroeconomics book... yet for some reason, i find the last part quite therapeutic."

"event","I honestly dont remember what time it was. I was laying in my bath tub in NYC, there was probably jazz playing in the backround, but softly.  The window directly next to the tub was wide open, it was winter, and the cold wind on the hot water created a sauna-like effect in my small bathroom.  Candles were lit and surrounding me, creating an ambiance perfect for two romantics, yet I was alone.  Cigarette in one hand and a beer clasped by the other one sitting on the sill, this was how I escaped from the lonely city.  It was you I would picture their with me.  I would have gladly put down my cigarette to have my hand surrounding yours.  Your warm body touching mine like it always had.
     Your mom called me.  I answered happily, yet she was crying.  She wanted me to pray, she figured that was all i could do.  She said i was the first person she called.  I layed there and prayed, i really did.  It really was all i could do for you, even returning home could do nothing for you physically.  
     I had to see you.  I knew little of your condition, yet only that your sister may be the one truly injured.  I lived on the third floor of an apartment building in Union Square, 15th street.  Penn station on 34th.  Every light was red.  The taxi ride felt like it couldnt have taken any longer.  Same with the 20 minute wait for the train.  Same with the hour and a half ride back to hamilton.  I don't remember if you knew i was coming.
     It was freezing outside, perfect bathtub weather.  My brother was working, seemed he was there late.  Apparently the rest of hamilton was working too,  even though the clock was much past 5.  More like 10.  I walked miles to find you with no recognition of where i was. I was horrible with directions.  I still am. Even when I'm walking.  A girl picked me up eventually.  I know her, my mom set up the whole ordeal.  With out her I was helpless.  
     My brother came home eventually.  It was with him that i came to see you.  I think his big red truck was better on ice than your little white one.  It got us their in time to see you pull away from the hospital with your family.  Your sister was okay. You were too. We followed you home.
     The six of us entered your house together.  Your parents were grateful for our arrival.  My hand surrounded yours. Your warm body touched mine. Your back door shut slowly, leaving cold air behind.  ""This is nicer than a bathtub"" I thought. ""This is what truly loving someone feels like."""

"event","Never again will he reach into his heart to bring the inwards out.  They were here for you to hold.  They were here for you to replace with yours and gently return the favor.  
                  Funny how yours went missing.
                                    Funny how you have two inside you.
He was in mid shower when it broke; instant, piercing, penetrating.  
                  You told him he loves cold water.
                                                  He loves cold water.
Your jolly composure brought pieces home.  It was only the jolly in you.  They went missing.
               Funny how yours went missing.

"event","when love becomes that of a dismantled arrangement instead of what love should truly be... is it still really love, or has the comfort of the word kept us from believing otherwise?... and on that note.. what should love truly be?"

"event","... it doesnt take much to inspire me, and these few words have done so.   if only the answers to the more important things in life were also found on the side of a starbucks cup..

""the human catalysts for ""dreamers"" 
are the teachers and encouragers
 that ""dreamers encounter throughout 
their lives.  They are invaluable in 
the quest to turn ideas into

"event",".. i spent tonight reminissing my time spent in the city... i found myself wishing i had made more of the situation, if only i had realized the amazing opportunity i had in front of me. i mean, dont get me wrong, i enjoyed living in the city... the freedom of my own apt, constant parties, (endless school work), my own apt, oh yeah ... my own apt...yet for some reason, thoughts of manhattan are always followed by a cringing stomach.  was it the fact that i lived weekend to weekend, waiting 5 seemingly unending days inbetween, to visit my dying friend?..  is it the fact that although i made many friends while i was there, none are even worth keeping?.. or have i just reached such a peek of unhappiness, that even the best things in life seem like that of nothing to celebrate or enjoy?

         these have been my thoughts today... altleast some of my floor plans turned out well in midst of shoving 30 g's down the drain....


over and out."

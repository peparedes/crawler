"event","Everything is so random . The more you plan, the more fucked up everything gets. It's crazy when you stop and look around and realize how far you are from where you thought you would be . And you hold onto things-memories and objects that tie you to these memories. 'I can prove that really happened to me and not to someone else - no one else remembers but i have the ticket stub'. But what about those instances that even you've forgotten? It's like that tree falling in the woods when there is no one around to hear it. We are all ruled by chaos. No rewards. No consequences. Everything is fucking random."

"event","Cavernous inside for the longest time and then there you were to awaken my senses . Colors existed again- especially red and I could feel my pupils getting large. This enmity inside disappeared for awhile and you made me laugh - I can still smile. I allowed your hearts juices to inundate mine . I was hopeful again. Hours after we kissed my taste-buds still dancing on my tongue. And now I'm forlorn and pathetic as hell and I think of you : often  more than I can stand. I've gone crazy for you. I'm losing my mind. I thought I could take it but I know now I was wrong."

"event","I think that some people are truly destined to do nothing. I think of these dreams I have and although it can be fun to dream: of all the things I could be , the things I could do or places I could venture - I know that they are just dreams. It's sad but true. It's like the ugly girl staring in the mirror day after day and repeating ""you're beautiful"", until finally one day she doesn't want to lie anymore and she accepts the truth. I think that my truth is that my dreams are unattainable. There are those who will hear this and say ""you can accomplish anything you put your mind to"" and such, but they always seem to be the ones whose parents had a college fund for each child and not an insatiable lust for the crack stem. The people who didn't have to admit and accept as a child that their parents had addictions that sometimes came before their needs. And there are those who would think of this as a sob story but no - it is simply the truth. And I am in ways so thankful for my life because I look around and see people my age and older with no personal experiences- people so shallow because they have not yet had to grow up.  But I love to dream. I love to think that one day I'll have the beautiful family and white picket fence and all the vacations abroad. And as unattainable as they may seem or actually be, these dreams drag me out of bed in the morning- and straight into the welcoming arms of a long walk to my minimum wage job."

"event","To give yourself to someone so completely. You put so much faith into someone and you think maybe when you're falling they will be there to catch you. Surprise is not the word to explain the way you feel when you fall flat on your face because youre not shocked. But to say I love you and... Because the moment you profess your greatest love you greet your greatest fear...more than anything else it's a kick in the teeth and the taste of your blood in a way so refreshing. So red and metallic. And so maybe unfortunately life will go on. The blood continues to pump through your sordid veins."

The colors were brighter than usual and the sounds smashed into my eardrums with such an intensity that my brains exploded-no they imploded and then my nose was bleeding SO red like my hair when it's ironed ketchup and my eyes thick puddles of mud. Speckled.like a frog. sitting on a speckled log eating the most delicious shit covered words."

"event","My insides like a cavern for so long. Dark and hollow and my heart all stinky and sodden with misery. And then there's you and HOPE?? I didn't think I could do that anymore and my frown lines were so deep. It was so strange at first to really smile. But I did and I invited you into ME. And you were so sweet and you made yourself right at home. And it felt like you belonged there like it was you that was missing for so long. The rooms so damp and cold and suddenly so warm and soft and exciting. The colors existed again - especially RED. And the smell of your sweat smelled so good to me and hours after we kissed I could still taste you and I thought of you and my belly flopped like a fish out of water. I've never felt like this before and I think even now I would follow you to the ends of the earth."

Because maybe one day again we'll be tangled up-as near as we can be but never close enough. And though your lips make me squirm like a flipped over worm my blood's boiling hot because I know that you're not and may never be all mine."

"event","I eat your words like they're my last meal. Ingesting vowels and swallowing consonants. Hungrily: never stopping for air. I consume your sentences until I'm bloated - not realizing that when it comes to you my hunger is insatiable. I chew your words not tasting-my belly begging for more. So empty and hollow without them . The first few phrases bouncing and echoing from wall to wall. Slowing falling and squeezing into place like squishy legos. So I binge-cramming words into every fleshy crevice. Each unoccupied fold filling with the letters falling from your delicious lips. I eat your words until I'm bloated...and I don't shit for days."

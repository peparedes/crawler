"event","Of course it's a good day. Why wouldn't it be? Lyman, the Fitness teacher, nearly killed me for a 10 minute mile--and that's not very good, at that. I reckon I'll be able to get to 6-7 minutes by the end of the trimester. And by then... I can run anywhere in PO, with no need for a liscence. Yay for practical thinking! :D

Me and the missus have been at odds and ends lately. She's been thinking, and pretty much ignoring me for whatever reason of hers. Apparently she did something so awful she can't even speak with me anymore. That makes me sad.

I put her on my binder today. Three pictures from when she was over for that beautiful week. And (Intoxication) Pained Lovely, which I found to be most fitting for the picture of us smiling together, (poem I wrote, for those that do not know.) Jamie said ""DAMN!"" several times when I was showing the binder to Trevor, explaining ""this is Ayla, my girlfriend who came over during the summer."" Everyone was suprised I had a beautiful girlfriend, I suppose, even though they covered their suprise horribly. What do you expect when you look like me? -sigh- I was going to ask her to call me, but with the way she's been treating me lately, I doubt she'd even wish to speak with me.

At any rate, I stole Will's binder to be able to put Ayla on it, so it's for a good cause. (And now it is my binder.) I also stole his fork. :|

That's what you get for letting me use you for your internet and frienship, you rotten bastard. I hope you never find your fork."

Hm. Talking to Mellie right now. I'm going to be doing some sprites and stuff for her, probably just for fun nostalgia. Gotta love the love-hate that iDraw3 gives ya, no? It crashes when you try to open .png files 30% of the time! woooo!!"

"event","Ayla's gone. Took her to the airport today, and I miss her already. She's probably in Denver at the moment waiting for her flight to the Jackson Hole I hear about. I turned off the fan, closed the window, and closed the door in the guest room so I could keep her smell in there as long as possible. I love her smell, and I feel bad it's not going to be around soon. She had gotten me Diary by Chuck Palahniuk (Fight Club, Choke) earlier this week, and I intend to read it. I wish I could hold her still."

Oh yeah--Ken came over to meet the Ayla for a few mins, which was indeed the sort-of fun, although Ayla was a bit shy. I would be, I suppose, but Ken is a master conversationalist and we had a jolly good small-talk. Indeed."

"event","Ayla's here, now. I woke up before her because I felt like it, even though she set her alarm (the one from my room she borrowed) so she could wake up earlier. But alas, Jake prevails. I have to sleep in my parents' room while she's here. XD Makes sense, I guess, since being in the room with her makes me want to have sex, et cetera. It's really amazing having her here--and just having her touch. Hm--We were going to go on a walk this morning, and she should be up in ten minutes to get ready, so wish me luck on the walk, I guess, even though by the time my friends read this, it'll have happened. I was going to intro Ayla to a few of my friends. Probably just Nick and Ken whenever we decide to go to the movies. It'd be a big deal if you two did, even if just for a ""hi"" and ""what's up"". Anyway, time to go do something productive. (This is the first time I'm willingly stepping away from the computer, yes.)"

I show up at school and I just sit out on the bleachers by the football field because I'm thinking of her-like to be alone when that happens. Cleans stuff up and keeps things clear. Anyway, later on, in second period, this girl keeps trying to poke me in the face. We go at it for about 5 minutes, her trying to poke me, and me slapping her wrists away. Then on the way home this girl kept trying to slap me-I think she just liked my touch. I kinda hurt her without trying, though; I wasn't meaning to. I was slapping her back lightly, too. (not in the face, you wife-abusing approvers.) Yeah-that was my day."

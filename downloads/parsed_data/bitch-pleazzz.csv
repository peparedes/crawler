<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>i started my new job at the DOLLAR CASTLE lol...its so boring, im a cashier and all i do is ring up shit to people. but im on my feet the whole day so i get so tired, and drained out. like how i feel right now. I just cleaned the dirty shit in my house, and im even more tired than i was coming home from a&nbsp; 10 hour shift today.&nbsp; I love working those hours though because it's so much more worth it to go there and stay there for a long time, as opposed to going for 5 hours. UgH i hate 5 hour shifts.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>So, joey and i are great. hes so amazing. sometimes i get pissed off at him, just to get pissed off at him, and i blow things out of proportion just because i want to break the glass you know? like, hes too perfect, there must be some faults, some mistakes. but he hasnt failed yet. he treats me like a princess, i can tell from the look in his eyes, he absolutely adores me. awww my pumpkin. today, we went to the pet store so he could buy Oreo a cage, for the winter, and such. it was sooo cute i saw these kitties and i wanted them alll of them! =[ they were little babies omg sooo pretty but they were taken care of already, they had that surgery so they cant have babies omg i felt so bad for them, they couldnt even choose if they wanted to have kids or not =[ and thats the whole point for me to even have a girl dog or cat....so it can breed. i think ashley is right, i want puppies sooooo bad because i cant have&nbsp;my own&nbsp;babies&nbsp;yet =[</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>im so nervous for college, i dont know why. i know i can do good if i dont know anyone...and sometiems i can do even better if i know someone....&nbsp;because of the competition. but who knows? im taking introduction to logic (philosophy), introduction to psychology, math(intermediate algebra), and english (composition 1). those are tough fucking classes, 13 hrs total for the semester, i cant BELIEVE im taking PHILOSOPHY and PSYCHOLOGY together!&nbsp; someone pray for me!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>so far, so good.....but im really tired. i gotta open up tomorrow!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>i cant wait to get my laptop. im so excited, seriously. 3 more weeks!!!!! i think im gonna get it from sam's club, because they have really good policies on returns/exchanges. i can return it up to 6 months after i get it, if something is wrong or i dont like it. im gonna get the best one just beacuse. lol</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff99ff size=1>anyways im tired as fuck its 1 in the morning i gotta wake up at 9 so that isn't cool. goodnight.</FONT></STRONG></P>

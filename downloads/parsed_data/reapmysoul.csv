"event","Wow.. it seems like everytime I think about posting, something major has went on in my life.&nbsp; I miss blogging oh so very much!&nbsp; Since my last post, I am still full of bitterness toward my birthfather and his family.. I just wish that I knew the underlying reason for his hate towards me.&nbsp; I went to see a palm reader right before my last post and she told me that I would find my answer in Church and that I needed to go back.&nbsp; Well, it had been 20+ years since I had really been.I went back. &nbsp; The second sermon that I attended was about inheritance.. it opened my eyes and let me know that it wasn&#39;t me.. and it wouldn&#39;t have mattered even if it was me.. what my birthfather did to me was wrong and it opened my eyes to the fairytale dream that I&#39;ve had all these years about where I came from. Real life.. reality.. it&#39;s not always what we want it to be.<br />
<br />
Since I wrote last, I now have a 3 month old little boy who , along with my 13 year old.. are my world.&nbsp; He was totally unexpected and a wonderful surprise, I got to go in the labor unit with his birthmother and the whole 9 yards.&nbsp; I brought him home from the hospital. I felt like from day 1, when I found out that I was getting him.. that he was God&#39;s gift to me, his promise that he will never forsake us.&nbsp; I&#39;m a happy mama."

"event","Wow.. it's really been almost 6 months since I've&nbsp; been on LJ?&nbsp; Unreal!&nbsp;&nbsp; 
My last post was about how cold it was.. now it's smoking hot and humid!

A few things have changed in my world since my last post.&nbsp; I decided to try my luck at rental property so I bought a house in the next town over that was a foreclosure. We've been spending all of our extra time, painting and fixing little things around the place. finally making it look like a home rather than a place that's been empty for several&nbsp; years.&nbsp; We still have a few weeks work left to go, then the rental sign will go up.&nbsp; My plans are for the house to pay for itself for several years, then sell it for profit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this one is up and going and IF it does well.. I'd like to add another rental property soon.&nbsp; It's a LOT&nbsp;of work though and I've been spending every second of any extra time that I have working on it seems like, I've painted so much that my hands are sore. &nbsp; Hubby .. wow.. he is so skilled at doing fix it stuff.. this could never work if he wasn't.&nbsp; I haven't seen a thing that he can't do!&nbsp;

A few weeks ago I was bitten by a spider at work.&nbsp; Wow.. I was really sick.&nbsp; I&nbsp;felt it when it bit me, but didn't think anything at all about it... thinking that a new necklace that I had on just pinched me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;woke up that Saturday morning running 102 + fever. &nbsp; It didn't break for 4 days either!&nbsp; I went to the doctor and they gave me a Rocephin and tetanus shot, a bottle of antibiotics and some really thick creme to put on the spot.&nbsp; I fainted in the office after the shots, not sure if it was because I had worked myself up so&nbsp; much over the shots or that i was dehydrated.. or the medicine itself.. either way, I fell out!&nbsp; Scary stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still have a red spot where the spider got me at, but it isn't infected or horrible looking at all.&nbsp; 

I'm off work today.&nbsp; I'm seeing that Victor and Nicki are still on the Young and Restless and The&nbsp;Price is Right just isn't the same anymore without Bob Barker on it!&nbsp;&nbsp; I've decided that i'm staying home today and being domestic.. it has to happen since&nbsp;I haven't been at home much in the last month!&nbsp;

Happy Memorial Day!"

"event","Almost 2 weeks ago I started a diet.. I honestly couldn't stand myself anymore and felt it was time to do something.&nbsp; I'm bigger than I've ever been EVER and I dont have anyone to blame but myself for that.&nbsp; 

I&nbsp;remember when I started gaining weight, right after losing my only pregnancy to miscarriage, dealing with a mentally and physically abusive husband.. the only comfort that I had was food.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't working at the time and I remember staring at those 4 walls day in and day out. Depressed, lonely and stressed from the recent loss of my father also.&nbsp; I was in my early 20's and food was my friend. 

Now in my mid 40s.. I look at my face and I still see me, but when I look at the rest of myself I don't know that person. I've decided to fix that problem and I'm serious this time. 

I started on the Alli (sp) program.&nbsp; Basically what it does is block a percentage of the fat that you consume.&nbsp; Well, I found out QUICK that this is a perfect behavior modification program for overeating and eating items high in fat. Just what I need!&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets put it this way.. since it's a fat blocker.. if you consume too much food or too much fat.. your gonna be perched on the throne for awhile!&nbsp; 

Believe you me, my lifestyle is busy and thats the last place that I have time to camp out at&nbsp; all day.&nbsp; So, I just am very VERY&nbsp;careful about what I eat.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you eat right, you'll have no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've stopped drinking Dr. Pepper.. I was drinking 2 cans a day.. which is way less than some people but still not good for&nbsp; you.&nbsp; Here in the south.. we love our super sweet tea.. I can say that I really do miss that but Splenda does a great job of faking it. 

I&nbsp;realize that this is a MAJOR&nbsp;feat for me.&nbsp; I prayed and asked God to help me do it and to give me strength.&nbsp; Everytime that I find myself wanting to cave in I&nbsp;ask him to help me.. He has been a fantastic support system!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
So far I've lost 5 lbs.&nbsp; That isn't much in 2 weeks but hey... I'll take what I can get and I'm not going to beat myself up if the lbs don't come off as fast as I'd like for them to.&nbsp; That's 5 down and LOTS&nbsp;to go.&nbsp; Water, Water and more WATER!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Yay ME!&nbsp;"

"event","It's a very stormy night here.. the satellite has gone out, so no TV.&nbsp; just the sounds of the the storm along with the wind pounding on my tin roof over the patio.&nbsp; Hopefully the rain will help wash some of this pollen away that's covering everything and making it bright yellow.&nbsp; 

My 16 yr old poodle passed away in Feb.&nbsp; I miss him so much..he made every step that I've made nearly for all these&nbsp; years, slept in the bed with me up until last year when he started falling off, and went thru a couple of husbands with me even!&nbsp;&nbsp;lol..&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the most loyal man I've ever know, seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;had him cremated and he now sits in a beautiful brass and mother of pearl urn in my china cabinet.&nbsp; When the day comes that I pass away, I hope that my wishes will be honored to have him buried with me.&nbsp; It's what he would have wanted. 

Earlier this month I was bitten by a brown recluse spider on my foot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you, that was one painful thing!&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;was very careful with it, and kept it covered with a bandage containing silver something or other, and cleaned it with peroxide several times a day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm happy to say that I don't think I will have any permanent skin loss&nbsp; from it.. even though it's still sore, it seems to be healing well.&nbsp; I'm scared of spiders in a big way.. this is the second time that I've been bitten.&nbsp; 

My job is going well.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;a new boss who is wonderful.&nbsp; My ex boss was screwing stuff up in a big way.&nbsp; Things are much more laid back now than what they were.. all of us seem to have a new outlook with the new boss.&nbsp; 

I just saw new pictures of my birthmom and sisters.&nbsp; It's been years since I've seen her and I just sorta sat and looked at the pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'm so different than them. .. I notice myself getting nervous and irritated when I see her pictures for some reason.&nbsp; Her husband has aged so much... it shocked me, but then again it's been years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pictures of the whole family.. my birthmom, brother and 2 sisters that I have never met.. it bugs me I guess that I'll never be a part of what they have as a family.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a strange feeling. 

I'm waiting for this storm to pass so I can go to bed.. Guess I worry about sleeping thru a tornado or something, lol.. 

night yall!"

"event","Wow.. I didn't realize that it had been 13&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks since my last post!&nbsp; Mostly these days I&nbsp;blog on Myspace and recently discovered facebook too.&nbsp; I don't care for facebook that much.

My baby girl turned 11 Saturday. It seems weird.&nbsp; My baby.&nbsp; My preteen baby.&nbsp; We had a fantastic party for her birthday.. a Hawaiian Luau theme.&nbsp; We let the kids get into the hot tub, grilled burgers and hot dogs and rented one of those big hopper things.&nbsp; THEN, 5 of the girls spent the night.&nbsp; I've never seen so many dirty/wet towels in all my life!&nbsp;lol.. The girls stayed up all night long.&nbsp; I'm glad it turned out fun.. Chels said that all the kids were talking about her party Monday and how fun it was.&nbsp; 

Newsflash!!!!

My oldest daughter has been coming around... She's came over about 4 times in the last few weeks.&nbsp; My guard is&nbsp; up big time, and she isn't the same child that I raised.&nbsp; I've came to the conclusion that it &quot;is what it is&quot; and I need to just take the good with the bad and not let her test my limits.

She has a tattoo now, and a tongue ring that she loves to show off.. She came to chels' birthday party dressed in a halter top with her entire bra sticking out of the back.. not just straps.. I&nbsp;was&nbsp; very embarrassed but what do you do?&nbsp; She's 24 yrs old and I didn't raise her to be like she is today.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it is what it is.&nbsp; 
The baby is darling.&nbsp; I'm trying not to get too attached to her because&nbsp; just as soon as I do, they'll be gone again.&nbsp; I know this.&nbsp; Her boyfriend is still the same ... he sat at the party and didn't mingle or really even speak to anyone.&nbsp; It's his personality or breeding or a little of both.&nbsp; I worry about the baby, but I really try not to think about it so I wont.

She seems happy to be around us.&nbsp; I'm glad. 
Her boyfriend got her to ask me for 10 dollars for gas.&nbsp; I knew it wasn't for gas.. and I said no.&nbsp; It felt good.&nbsp; I knew if I started something like that it would only get worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, he went out partying that night.. but at least it wasn't on my money!&nbsp; 

Well, it's my bedtime folks.. I just wanted to check in!&nbsp;&nbsp; Hugs!~&nbsp;"

I want to make it special for them.. and I'll do my best.. but with the cost of food like it is,&nbsp; I hope they don't expect a big spread.. I'll do a cake, cookies and some candy.. maybe deviled eggs.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the bosses is cooking Chili and the guys are donating $3.00 each to cover expenses for that.&nbsp; Some of them actually grumbled about having to pay 3 dollars.. geez.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a party to go to Tuesday night.. then I'll be hosting a get together here.. then another one Christmas afternoon.&nbsp; I've been cooking my butt of lately and freezing things.&nbsp; I'm not going just way overboard this year like previous years... It works me too hard and I don't have any help, not even with the cleanup.&nbsp; I enjoy having everyone over, but the bottom line is, I just work too much now to put on big party like I use to do.&nbsp; Tomorrow I need to make out my menu's and go to the grocery store.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been good at&nbsp; using coupons lately for things, and stocking up on things as they come on sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; I figure with the economy in this town like it is right now, I probably need to get in practice again. <br /><br /><br />New Years Eve we'll be going to a friends for a get together.. we always have a blast and I'm excited about getting to see everyone.&nbsp; It's been awhile and it will be nice to just relax and enjoy.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I'm done with my Santa doings.. She's getting a TV, Nintendo DS games and other odds and ends.&nbsp; She wanted a flat screen TV, but.. ugh.. I just couldn't see that just yet!<br /><br />Has anyone ever made Turtle butter candy?&nbsp; I&nbsp;made it the other night and I have to say that it's the prettiest candy that I remember seeing in a long time.. and OHHHH so easy!&nbsp; I&nbsp;broke mine apart like bark, instead of cutting into squares.. I think it's going to be a hit!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll make another batch tomorrow to send to the police station and have for my work party.&nbsp;&nbsp; So far I've made that, caramel dipped pretzels and fudge.. which was much easier than my granny's recipe, but good none the less.. I have some cakes and cookies frozen too... thank goodness for the freezer!&nbsp; <br /><br />I've had these small, freaky looking knots come up on the inside of my left wrist recently.&nbsp; They are spongy feeling and look about the size of a pea and under the skin.&nbsp; I keep hoping that they will go away but they haven't yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it's going to mean a trip to the doctor soon, I just hope that he doesn't say surgery... both of my jobs require extensive use of my hands.. and cannot be done if I'm in any sort of cast at all.&nbsp; I wish I knew what these things were.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</p><p>I hope everyone has a bright and beautiful weekend before Christmas!</p>"

"event","Happy Thanksgiving Ya'll!

I'm spending the day alone for the most part.. hubby had to work a 12 hr shift and the little one is at her dads for the day.&nbsp; We'll have our Thanksgiving dinner tonight once everyone gets home.&nbsp; This is the first quiet Thanksgiving that I've had in a while, years!&nbsp; It seems very strange.&nbsp; 

I like to cook when I'm alone.&nbsp; I don't have to stop and do anything unless it's to tend to one of the furbabies or something.&nbsp; Usually I just leave the backdoor open and watch them playing outside.
Speaking of Furbabies... A couple of months ago we adopted a Boxer from the animal shelter nearby.&nbsp; He was soooo skinny, his hip bones stuck out and his ribs were showing..he weighed only 34 lbs the day that we got him, poor baby.&nbsp; Like everything else around here. myself included.. I can proudly say that he has some meat on his bones now and has easily gained at least 20 lb lbs. He's beautiful, shiny and spoiled rotten.&nbsp; He is definitely full blooded..I can't see someone just chunking him out.. but maybe they got him not realizing the high energy that they have.&nbsp; We named him Sam, the name just seemed to fit him. He loves to love on you and give hugs.. such a personality too!

Animals just seem to come to us for some reason.. We had a stray cat that had beautiful white kittens and we luckily were able to give them all away to a great family who took the mother too.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days ago, we looked outside and there was yet ANOTHER stray cat lying on the blanket on the porch all snuggled up to the yard dog.&nbsp; This is a HUGE big male cat with long hair.. he disappears during the day, but at night he's right back in his spot next to the dog.&nbsp; 

The downside of living in a rural area is that idiots dump their animals out here pretty often.&nbsp; I think the police&nbsp;should make a few examples out of these people that choose to do that. 

This is a very bleak Thanksgiving for some people in this town this year.&nbsp; Our local paper mill closed down just last week.. never to reopen again.&nbsp; Since this has always been a Mill town and that's the main industry here.. well, the ONLY&nbsp;industry really.. it scares me for the town.. it scares me for even MY&nbsp;job on down the line.&nbsp; We had a local car lot go out of business here too and the huge lot is empty now.. just a product of the sad state of our economy this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm thankful that we both have jobs, and even though we'll never get rich at either of them.. we both enjoy what we do and we are blessed in so many ways.&nbsp; 
I had an old man tell me the other day that this is the time to be frugal.. to save instead of spend and to cut back when and where we can.&nbsp; Times are bad for this nation as far as the economy goes.&nbsp; 

I'm cutting back on spending this year.. We'll buy for Chels of course, but the older, grown&nbsp;&nbsp;kids we won't.&nbsp;They all have jobs, minus my daughter whom I haven't seen in 2&nbsp; yrs come April.&nbsp; &nbsp;We've spent on all of them every year and never as much got a Christmas card from them.&nbsp; We'll buy for our Mothers and each of us have a brother that we will buy something for, 3 teacher gifts this year and each other, and that's basically going to be it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to buy for my Grand daughter, but... they wouldn't give it to her if I did.. so I'm not wasting the money, besides.. she has no clue who I even am. 

Any suggestions on Teacher gifts this year?&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually do dish towels because I like to give something that they can use.. but I'd like to do something different this year, I just don't know what.&nbsp; 

I'd better get back to cooking.. 

Happy Thanksgiving!"

Ewwwww, those few lines were seriously BAD!&nbsp; They could have left that part out.. people in the audience were cutting eyes at each other, wondering what the heck!<br /><br />Chels did good and looked so pretty.&nbsp; Her looks are changing so much just this year.&nbsp; I have all my pics posted on myspace, if you'd like to look, please do!&nbsp; Also, add me if you'd like and have a page yourself. <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/remembertheredhead"">http://www.myspace.com/remembertheredhead</a><br /><br />On the way back from Baton Rouge, We stopped at the Myrtles plantation in St. Francisville, LA. us three, my ex husband, his girlfriend and her kids stopped too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you have heard of this plantation, it's one of the most haunted places they say.&nbsp; If you google about the place, you'll get a history that's very interesting.&nbsp; Sylvia&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown has been there, and the Montel Williams show did a segment on it, along with other media people.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p><p><em>One of the tales of the place involves a young slave girl that got her ear chopped off.. she haunts the place and is known to take women's earrings.. just one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chelsea warned me not to wear any earrings.. I did and I kid you not.. while I was walking on the&nbsp; grounds I felt my ears and one of my earrings was missing!!&nbsp; The kids just absolutely LOVED this.. and were so freaked out by it.. as was I!&nbsp;&nbsp; Chels ran in and told the lady that worked there and she said that it happens all the time, to leave my name and phone number and they would contact me&nbsp;when&nbsp;it showed up in the house somewhere.&nbsp; Normally, I don't believe stuff like this, but It seriously happened to me!!&nbsp; <br />I&nbsp;also have pictures posted on myspace that we took while there.&nbsp; They say that the ghostly images and things show up in the pictures.. one of my friends just emailed me and told me that there was a face in one of the pictures&nbsp;and a shadowy figure in&nbsp;a window.. &nbsp;and I saw it too.. if you look at the pictures you'll see the comment she left.&nbsp; Please if you look at the pictures and see anything, let me know or leave a comment so everyone can see it under the picture!!<br /></em><br />Our trip there was fun.&nbsp; I&nbsp;went exploring on the grounds with the kids while everyone else seemed less interested and sat at the tables waiting on the tour.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;wanted to walk around and feel the place.. and felt it I did!&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked under the trees and by an old well.. I felt a strong feeling in one spot in the yard.. so we took pictures there.&nbsp; The kids found some black cats wandering around which added to their excitement of the place and it being so close to Halloween too.. they were excited.&nbsp; I would like to go on their mystery tour at night, but I definitely would not want to spend the night there.&nbsp; It's a bed a breakfast too, but around $200 a night to stay. <br />&nbsp;</p>"

Several of them.  She asked me about my mother too.  I was surprised, but at the same time not getting my hopes up.  I reminded myself that she was living with an idiot, who controls her every move and action.  If he told her not to send any more pictures, it would end immediately. So, I'm just playing it cool.  The baby is very cute, I'll try to post a pic of her later when I get home."

"event","I was up and down all night last night with a very sick little girl.  I'm almost 100% sure that it has to be the flu.  She started out with aches and pains, scratchy throat. She was coughing some yesterday before daycare, but not bad and no fever.  When I picked her up from daycare yesterday I could tell that she felt like crap by looking at her, plus she was quiet- very VERY unusual for her.  When we got home I took her temp and it was 102.  I gave her tylenol cold and decided that I'd better get up thru the night and give it to her too.  About 11 her fever broke and I changed her wet clothes with her sleeping right through it. At 2 the fever was back so I doped her up again and at 6 this morning it was still at 102, she was coughing a deep rattling cough and she's very pale. /sigh.. to hell with the person that infected my baby!  One weird thing, she will not let me turn her light off in her room. She normally wants it dark but now is sleeping with the light on. 

Thank goodness for long weekends!  I'm so sleepy, but have to work in my shop in a few. Hopefully, it wont be a busy day.  Gotta do laundry and house stuff after that.. the MIL is coming to spend the night tomorrow night and Monday so she can go to the doctor Monday."

"event","The view from my office window this morning.. It looks like it's SNOWING!! Of course, it's not really, but the stuff that's falling off the tree next to me looks just like snow. The last time it really snowed here was sometime in the 1990's. The other view is a crop duster spraying the field right across the street. I don't like watching planes and I'm sure that I'll have a nightmare about this one tonight or very soon.  They just make me very nervous watching them. 

I had a serious bout with Mommy guilt this morning.  Chels woke up coughing, not feeling well but I had to dose her up with Tylenol Cold and send her on to daycare anyway.  Poor baby.  They were out of school today for parent teacher meetings.  I really just wanted to stay home, let her sleep late, make her some chicken and stars when she woke up and snuggle with my sick baby girl.  It's a long weekend for me though, I'll be off Monday and she will too."

"event","As soon as I got to work today, got the computer turned on and Coffee cooking.. I heard a big WHAM outside my office.  I looked out and could see 2 cars smashed up pretty good and on opposite sides of the 4 lane. I immediately grabbed the phone and called 911.  It took the officers way too long to get there, actually.. the ambulance made it there first.  I don't think that it was any real major injuries, but the car that got hit took the most damage.  By the sound and the speed limit posted there.. I'm sure the girl hit the guy in the car going at least 50 MPH.  I found out later that the girl was driving a rental car.  I wonder if you have to pay the damage if you wreck one of those things?   In this  case, it's going to be pretty pricey I would assume. 

The flu seems to be going around town pretty badly lately.  The Stomach virus too.  I'm trying to be VERY cautious about washing my hands and spraying lysol at work since we all seem to be just passing our sinus crud around from person to person.  They've had some nearby schools closed because of the flu. 

I'm gonna make myself go to bed early tonight.. something I rarely ever do!"

"event","Oooooo after watching HGTV yesterday I saw the perfect solution to my storage problem.  They did a segment where cabinets were placed in the utility room.. LOTS of cabinets.. almost like a kitchen sorta.  My utility room is big.. like 12 x 20 or more, but it has LOTS of just empty, wasted space.  What happens when you have empty space... you fill it up with crap you don't really need.   In my UR I have.. a big chest freezer, washer, dryer, hot water heater, potato bin, extra ironing board, roll around table thing and a huge dresser, complete with a mirror and a computer desk.   It sounds like a LOT because it is a lot of stuff in there.  I made up my mind today that the desk, the table, the dresser and the potato bin are going going as good as GONE!  That will open up that entire wall that I can do cabinets on with DOORS, giving us lots of storage for extra pots and pans, cleaning stuff, even a spot to hang coats and jackets.  

I'm in the spring cleaning mode anyway..even though its cold and not even close to spring yet,  last weekend it was clean out the closets and dresser.. this weekend I'm putting down new shelf paper in the kitchen.. it needs it bad.  

When my house is in order, I feel like my life is in order.. I know you women out there understand this :)"

"event","<p>I found out last night that a couple that live in our neighborhood and have lived near me almost all my life out here, were killed in a Car/Horse trailer accident Friday night.&nbsp; Both the husband and wife were killed.. they were in their 60's and were on their way back from their cabin in Colorado.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were killed here in Louisiana, less than 2 hours from home if the story that I got is correct.&nbsp; Seems as if she was driving, pulling the horse trailer and didn't judge her distance correctly when she changed lanes, causing the back end of the trailer to clip another vehicle.. and you can imagine the rest of the story with a heavy gooseneck trailer on the back of a pickup truck. <br /><br />I grew up with their son.. It's so sad for both he and his sister.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use to find so much peace in sitting at my window and watching his cattle late in the evening and in the early mornings when my life was in turmoil after my ex was in a bad accident.&nbsp; Just sitting still and &nbsp;looking at their farm across the street seemed to bring balance to my world then, if even for just a little while.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I found out about them late last night.. I just wanted to call my mama..and wished that I could.. like old times.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also wanted to hug my hubby and daughter, because it was a shocking reminder that none of us are promised tomorrow and people that we love and care about can be ripped from us in a blink of an eye. </p>"

"event","<p>Ever been in Walmart when they get a bomb threat?&nbsp;&nbsp; I was saturday night about 11.&nbsp; What&nbsp;a fiasco it was, but I certainly have to hand it to the associates as they are called.&nbsp; They did a fantastic job of rustling folks out of the store and very quickly.&nbsp; We were actually at the very back of the store and like most people.. kinda half way listening to the announcement on the speaker.&nbsp; After the second announcement, I noticed that it didn't sound normal, the speaker's voice was very nervous.. so I paid attention.. Code Blue, customers leave your buggys where they are and exit the store immediately.&nbsp; All customers come to the front of the store NOW!&nbsp; Well, I thought that code blue means that someone is dead but for WM it means a bomb threat.&nbsp; We rushed to the front and it was like a stampede of cattle trying to get out of the door, no one knowing what * code blue* actually meant.&nbsp; J stopped in the front with the police officer since his job defintely requires him to stay in a situation like that.&nbsp; I had to leave though, and HE had the car keys in his pocket :)&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually during the excitement he figured out that I was most likely getting eaten alive by mosquitos, which I was!&nbsp; He brought me the keys, I moved the car to the back of the parking lot and ate M &amp; M's and watched the excitement from the comfort of the car.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 6 firetrucks and even more police cars weren't nearly as exciting as the people watching.&nbsp; Teens on dates, someone in their house shoes that thought they were just gonna run in and out, people with babies, old people wondering wtf!&nbsp; But the best laugh of the night was watching some teenager try to strut around in jeans and a pair of heels that were obviously way too high.&nbsp; She made trip after trip back and forth thru the parking lot from one car to another, hugging this person and that person.. trying to be cute but it wasn't working since she was struggling to walk in those shoes not made for a parking lot, lol.&nbsp; They determined that the caller was on a payphone on the other side of town, but he was pretty darn brave since he called the police department to report it.&nbsp; Kids with nothing to do on a Saturday night.&nbsp; I'm not sure if they caught him, but I'm sure that it's mandatory time if they do. </p><p>This week we are taking a small trip to Hot Springs Arkansas for a little vacation.&nbsp; I'm trying to book a hotel online but that in itself is scary since you really don't know what you're getting.&nbsp; We plan to visit a military museum, the mid american museum, go shopping and take Chels to the alligator farm during feeding time.&nbsp; I also want to have a picnic on top of the mountain there since they have a covered picnic area.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be fun, I love that town!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />We were given one of those blue pools that you blow the ring up on the top and fill it up with water.. well.. those things are a pain in the arse when you don't have a yard that seems to have one level spot on it.&nbsp; I've always hated those things, and think they are a huge eyesore in someones yard, J and chels on the other hand,&nbsp;have always wanted one.&nbsp; When we were offered one, he didnt want to turn it down. So we brought the thing home, tried to set it up and it never did fill up right. &nbsp;We moved the pool 3 times, since it was second hand, it had a small leak, and it never did fill up and look like it was suppose to look, always looking wap sided and crazy. Today after Chels sat on the edge of it, it leaked so badly that her and J got one of&nbsp; his swords and just wacked and stabbed the entire pool, water gushing everywhere.. She thought it was hilarious.. and I couldnt help but wonder what the neighbors probably thought with them out there wacking on the pool with swords.. lol.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our hospital here is having dificulty, losing money and on the verge of having to shut the doors.&nbsp; The administrator quit Friday.&nbsp; They are in the red and have been for some time now.&nbsp; Its the only hospital in town, so hopefully it wont have to close.&nbsp; Certainly though an investment company or something needs to come in here and take over the operations.&nbsp; People also need to stop using the ER for a doctor office with snotty nosed younguns, when they can do just like everyone else and make an appt. to see the doctor.&nbsp; Medicaid mama's are well known to use and abuse the system in some cases.&nbsp; Chels has a medical card because of her CP diagnosis, but one thing that I never do is abuse it.&nbsp; If everyone thought like I did on that, I don't think the rural hospitals like ours would have a problem.&nbsp;<br /><br />My cough/cold is better.&nbsp; I go to the doctor Tomorrow but called them on Friday and had them call me in an antibiotic.&nbsp; Personally, after having a sore throat and 3 colds within a month, I'm almost positive that I had pnemonia based on the amount of coughing that i've been doing and the soreness in my left lower lung and congestion. I could tell a difference the first day that I took the antibiotic.. I'm much better now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Yesterday I felt so good that I cleaned Chelseas room from top to bottom.&nbsp; I hauled out her big playhouse, her bassinet for the dolls, and that big mysize Barbie.&nbsp; Stuff that was just cluttering up her room.&nbsp; I also put all of her stuff animals into a big mesh laundry hamper thing.. they look cute in there and it's pink so it matches her room. I organized her closet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats one thing that I haven't done since we moved here, but always did in the other house.&nbsp; Now her winter clothes are on one side, jeans all together, school uniforms all together, costumes on one side and summer shirts in the center so she can reach them easily.&nbsp; It sure makes it look much nicer!&nbsp;<br /><br />It's time for her swimming lessons, hope everyone has a fun Monday!<br /><br />Other than that.. no news is good news as the old saying goes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm doing the regular monday stuff.. laundry from the weekend. <br /></p>"

It's been a lazy day for me so far.&nbsp; I slept til after 12, which was glorious and much needed since I've been sick with this crud.&nbsp; J got up rushing around trying to get dressed and he was out the door within 20 mins headed off to do a few things with his friends out at their rescue unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't seen much of him lately, he goes out there everyday and works on something, spending the day yesterday dragging for a car out on a local lake that had been submerged for several years.&nbsp; Sometimes I welcome the alone time when he's gone, but other times I think about just how many hours I actually do spend alone and HAVE spent alone over my lifetime.&nbsp; Comes with the territory I guess when you work from home all your life and don't really establish firm friendships that would typically come with a normal work enviroment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sometimes he wonders and makes fun of me for liking my animals like I do.&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn't understand and wouldn't understand how much&nbsp; company they are to me at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

My ex got&nbsp; scammed by his latest girlfriend who turned out to be married to someone that she was claiming that was only her room mate.&nbsp; 4 months and about 3k later he finds out that she was a fake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw right through her the first time I met her,&nbsp; claiming to be churchy to the point where all she wore was dresses and no makeup, but had tattoos on her back and legs.&nbsp; I also was creeped out by the fact that she was dragging this very young looking man around with her, who she claimed was her room mate.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very bitter about the entire thing, and I don't blame him.&nbsp; Of course, the story is much bigger than this paragraph that I've written and way more detailed.&nbsp; I'm sure he will get some sort of revenge.. lol. 

My ebay sales have been slower this month, but I still continue to pick up&nbsp; merchandise to sell.&nbsp;&nbsp; This week I made a deal with a store manager to buy all of her second hand ties in her store.&nbsp; She quoted me a price of 15 dollars for all of them so I jumped on it.&nbsp; Once I emptied her tie racks, they filled up 2 buggys full!&nbsp; I came home and sorted them into groups of paisleys, stripes, solids and abstracts.. and my favorite, RETRO ones!! pulling out a few of the very named brand ones or special ones to sell separately.&nbsp; My sales on ties have been pretty good in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last big lot of them that I sold was to a Christian singer in California.&nbsp; I have found myself fascinated with all the different types and colors of ties too!&nbsp; I still keep hoping to someday be able to sell on Ebay and make what I make in my shop doing hair, because some days I REALLY get burned out on the hair stuff!&nbsp;&nbsp; I find myself not wanting to do certain things, like really difficult color jobs.. things that use to challenge me in the past dont interest me any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also seem to attract the worst of the worst as far as bad hair goes sometimes!&nbsp;

Well, I'm thinking that I may get dressed and go to town, I really need to&nbsp;&nbsp;try to find me a couple of tshirts for the summer since most of mine or either stained up from work or faded because I've had them so long.&nbsp;&nbsp; I rarely buy myself clothes and so when I'm down to not having much to wear, I'm REALLY down to not much!&nbsp;&nbsp; My tennis shoes I bought in January just didn't hold up either so I need to get some more because my left heel has been hurting, so I'm going to contribute that to the shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought New Balance in January and everyone raves about NB but for me they just haven't held up or worked well.&nbsp; I usually wear Nike&nbsp; gladiator's and I love them, so that's what I'm going back with.&nbsp; I just can't always seem to find them when I'm looking.&nbsp;

"event","This has been a crazy but enjoyable week.&nbsp;&nbsp; J had a conference out of town so we went with him.. stayed with my brother one night and then in a hotel the other nights.&nbsp; J was wrapped up most of the days with convention stuff, and some of the nights too.. so Chels and I just sorta did our own thing for the most part and we enjoyed every second of it!&nbsp;

We went to the boardwalk.. OMG that place was heaven.. and I don't even like to shop but I loved this place.&nbsp; We ate at Joe's crab shack, hit some antique stores, spent a day at the pool ( she swam all day, I read)&nbsp; J and I did go to a comedy club one night which was hosted by his convention group.&nbsp; That was really good and the first time that I had ever been to one.&nbsp; My brother babysat for me.&nbsp; J had evening socials most every night, which he attended one night.. we could have went with him but for some reason before he walked in the door where everyone was, &nbsp;he held his hand up for me to stop like he didnt want us to come in.&nbsp; So Chels and I just turned around and went off to explore the hotel while he did that.&nbsp; It hurt my feelings bad.. some lady stopped me in the hall and asked why I didnt go in with him because everyone else in there had their kids and family.. I replied to her that he obviously didn't want us there and she made a face and as I was walking off, she yelled back to me.. "" Hey honey.. it's HIS loss!""&nbsp; which made me feel better but also let me know that she also thought that he was being a prick about it.&nbsp;

On our hotel discovery walk, we found a brand new beautiful grand piano.. just sitting out in the hall.&nbsp; I let chels sit down on the bench and just admire it's beauty.&nbsp; We also found a walkway over the river, and sat and watched it flow with all the nighttime lights in the background.. beautiful.&nbsp; Once he was done with his evening social.. he called my cell phone and I just let it ring.. and ring and ring :) over and over again.&nbsp;&nbsp; He finally found us and I blew it off as if I didnt have a signal... hah..&nbsp;

I finally got over my bad cold and was much better last week.. came down with the mess again last night, but this time it seems to be in my chest moreso than anywhere else.&nbsp; I think that I need vitamins or something.. this is the third time in about 6 weeks that i've had a cold.. I never took antibiotics for it, maybe I should have because I think its the same cold.. it just keeps lingering.&nbsp;

Of course, yesterday and today I've had to play catch up in my ebay store and also&nbsp;&nbsp;in my shop.&nbsp; So behind on everything.&nbsp; I just dyed some teenage girl's hair purple.. that was fun&nbsp; and funky looking.&nbsp; She loved it.&nbsp;

I'm so ready for real food.. good country cooked food like what I'm use too.. I'm making beef tips and rice today with fresh corn, &nbsp;then tomorrow I'm cooking a big pot of fresh green beans and potatoes .. YUMMY.&nbsp;&nbsp; It gets old fast when you eat out for a week and nothing really tastes like what you cook.&nbsp;

More later.. gotta get my rice on"

We decided to name her Sophie, since it kinda goes with Sadie, who is my Min pin. &nbsp;Mostly I got her so Sadie would have someone to play with and keep her company, since my poodle is 14 and doesn't want to be bothered.&nbsp; I swear my critters appreciate me and thats one reason I love animals so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Today is high school graduation here, my ex step daughter is graduating.. she called me last night crying because no one was coming to her class night and she wanted me to come.&nbsp; Of course, I was 2 hrs&nbsp;&nbsp;away and didnt make it in time.. If I had known that she wanted me to come to that I would have left a little earlier than what I did.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll certainly go to graduation tonight though if it doesn't rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I've been sick all week with a bad cold/bronchitis, but seem to be a little better now thank goodness.&nbsp; I got sick after spending my birthday out in the soaking rain after the tornado's hit here working with the Red Cross.&nbsp; <br /><br />Well, its time to get ready for work.. I have an extremely busy day which is always a good thing! </p>"

After marrying him, she says that she woke up one morning and wondered why they did that, so she had it annulled. She says they never consumated the relationship.. ummm I find that hard to believe.. VERY HARD but whatever floats her boat. So now the ex just lives with her and MY ex is her boyfriend and they all have an understanding.&nbsp; Umm weird if you ask ME!!&nbsp;<br /><br />The boys that slept in the room with Chels was this ex husband of hers, her 11 yr old son and her son's 12 yr old friend that was spending the night.&nbsp;&nbsp; It won't happen again because she wont be going back to spend the night, period.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She also asked me if I thought that my ex wanted to have kids of his own, since Chels was adopted.&nbsp; Of course, I know he does.. I knew that almost immediately after we got married that it bothered him that I couldnt have kids, when I found an email that he had written to someone stating that it bothered him.. dispite the fact that I was always very open, honest and told him everything, and he knew.. said it didnt bother him.&nbsp; It bothered me a great deal when I ran across that email that he left opened on my computer one day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe she can give him the child that I never could since she's only 30 and has kids already.&nbsp; I was surprised at my feelings of failure all over again today when she was asking me about having children.. I guess some things never really leave you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>"

"event","I think it's skipped spring here and jumped straight into summer.  I worked in the yard late last night, til dark anyway.. they had azalea's marked down to 1.50 simply because the blooms were gone on them so I bought some, also got some more Canna bulbs and about 2o bags of mulch yesterday.  Chelsea got some impatiens to plant around the goldfish pond, a caladium and mum to plant. We'll do that this afternoon. 

This morning I got up and finished spreading the mulch on the flower beds on each side of the driveway.  I could easily use about 20 MORE bags of mulch at least, probably more than that to do along the fence row.  I weeded the monkey grass along the side of the drive ( that stuff is terrible to get grass mixed in with it) checked the rose and lily garden for weeds and got a few out, turned over the mulch around the hot tub and fertilized all the plants with 13-13-13.  I guess I'm either getting old or I'm terribly out of shape.. BOTH I know, but I don't like to admit it.  I was pooped after about 2 hours.  I walked in the house to fix me a big glass of iced tea and decided that I would just strip down to nothing to cool off.  It's rare that I can do that since usually someone is here.. but here I sit in my birthday suit and it feels GOOD!!! 

This week I am determined to plant my garden.  The ground is broke up, not rowed up but broke up and it's time.  Although, its not gonna be nearly as much as last year.  All I want is a few Tomato plants and maybe some squash and okra.  Last year we had eggplant and peppers, carrots, squash, cucumber and it nearly worked me to death, not to mention the expense.  I think I could have went and bought everything for a whole lot less than what I spent on plants. 

Yesterday when * HE * was off doing his thing with his guard unit, me and Chels went shopping for plants, went to walmart, and I took her to McDonalds, which is something that we rarely do. He got home about 1ish, but not til after he had called my cell phone about a gazillion times.. Bahhahahaha..<evil grin=""grin"">  When I did answer he wanted to know where we were and what we had been doing.  Gosh it's amazing how making them wonder also makes them sweat when they have no idea what your up to and they've screwed up :)  

I'm almost 99% sure that he is going to re-enlist. He needs 8 yrs before he can draw retirement from them.  Of course I don't want him to, but thats not a decision that anyone else should make for someone. 
I'd rather him go ahead and get it over with while Chels is still home, than him be overseas somewhere when she's moved off to college.  

I got still and now I'm sleepy."

I like most of them,  All except for the buttered popcorn flavor, thats just WRONG!

Tomorrow is my baby's birthday, she will be 9. I have a party planned for Saturday afternoon at a pizza place.  Time goes by so fast that it's sad sometimes. I wonder sometimes what in the world i'm gonna do with myself once she's gone.  J is not really a kid person at all, It's one area that I wish he was different in. But, he didnt raise his own kids and it doesn't bother him in the least when he goes months without hearing from them. I can understand that about his kids, they are just pitifully lacking in so many areas due to their upbringing with their mother and step father. It's sad really, It's just like redneck hell at their house and they love it that way! I'm just different I guess,  I absorb myself in my kids, especially my little one,  and I love it that way, wouldn't have it any other way. 

She's leap testing this week.  She was worried about it Sunday night so much that she couldn't sleep.  After day one, she was so excited and couldn't wait to take the next test because it was about writing and she loves that.  I'm hoping that she will score high on the test, I expect her to.  If her score is high, she will be tested for gifted again.  She is also testing for her probationary black belt Saturday morning.  Big week for her this week.  

I got a text from my oldest daughters boyfriends cell phone yesterday. It said * Whutupma?* and thats it.  I tried to call them back, no answer of course, left a msg but still haven't heard back.. I dont expect to.  It's been since the first of Jan since I've saw her or the baby.  Almost 3 months. God has his reasons for all of this, just wish that I knew what they were sometimes. 

My azaleas are beginning to open up.  In a few years this yard will be just beautiful with them, once all the new ones that i've planted get bigger.  I planted about 20 or more the last couple of weeks.  I love working in the yard this time of the year. 

I'm thinking of having my 14 yr old poodle knocked out ( that sounds awful!) and having his hair cut, ears cleaned out and toenails cut as short as they can get them.  He hates for anyone to mess with him now that he's gotten so old.  His cataracts are so bad that he cant see well, can't hear hardly at all now either, but he's perky and fiesty and will bite you like crazy if you mess with his feet.  It was so tramatic last time I took him to be groomed that I said no more, it really upset him to the point that he was throwing up.. the groomer even had to call us to come up there to hold him while she tried to cut his feet. This dog is like my child and more loyal than any man that I've ever had,lol.. it upsets me to leave him when I know he's upset.  It just wasn't worth it to go thru all that or to put HIM thru all that.  Weve been cutting his hair ourselves, but my gosh he looks awful because he wont let me cut his feet.  I've been nipping one toenail at a time while he's asleep.. once he feels the cutter clamp down on it he comes alive and thats all she wrote, lol.  He just needs to be cut really short, at this point I don't care how pretty he looks, all the hair just needs to be off for the summer.

"event","As most of you on my friends list knows, I have 2 children that I raised for about 7 yrs that were my step kids, in addition to my 2 girls.  I was married to their drunk of a father and tolerated him for as long as I did for their sake. Their mother was no where in the picture during those years, I did the raising, tended to them when they were sick..baseball, softball, sitting out in the heat during tournaments,I did everything that a mother would and should do. I was mom. 
I only hear from ANY of the kids for the most part when they need or want something.  The boy I last saw about a week before Christmas because he needed a haircut, and highlights.  I invited him, like I did all the kids.. for Christmas. He didn't show up which didnt surprise me because he already had his hair cut so why should he?  He didnt call Christmas, and he's been off working in Texas since right after the first of January.  He got in Monday and i'm SURE he needs a haircut so he's been calling and I haven't been answering.  A part of me feels ashamed for doing that, another part of me really doesn't give a damn because i'm tired of all of my kids only coming around when it involves me doing something for them.  I got NOTHING for Christmas from any of them, not a card..not a call, not anything! BTW, this boy is 20 yrs old. I love him just like I do all of them, but for the life of me I dont understand why they never think about me until they need something. It hurts my feelings AND it pisses me off! Maybe I'm wrong for not answering the phone.. I don't know. 

I've been attempting to sew a little today but as soon as I got one seam done the machine hung up.  Brilliant me decides to take the thing apart and now I can't get it back together.. lol. Thank goodness my sweetie is much better at putting stuff back together than I am. 

Chels is still excited about her haircut. She likes brushing it and jumping up and down feeling it bounce.  She said about half of the kids liked it, the other half ( the boys) didnt, lol. I think that's pretty typical.  She said that one girl called her Dora and that really ticked her off good.  She hates Dora for some reason. I told her that girl was saying that because she knew that she'd get a reaction :) She likes it and that's all that matters. 

I went to a town meeting last night. It lasted 3.5 hours, very interesting stuff being said. I'm surprised how very few people actually go to these meetings. I always enjoy them when I do get a chance to go. I had trouble sleeping once I did get home and settled. My insomnia has been bad the last few nights and I wake up tired.  Maybe I can call it an early night tonight or at least I hope!"

I wonder if this is really some sort of phobia or something with me cutting my hair, lol..screwed up, especially since I'm a beautician!  My oldest had long curly hair until she had the baby, my youngest long straight hair. Either way, they have always had long hair.

It was to her butt and beautiful light blonde, shiny.. you know that hair that all us grown up's would DIE for.. Well, it's to her shoulders now and looks very cute.  She was excited this morning  because she could fix her own hair and Mom didn't have to do it.. or should I say, fight the tangles.  Every 2 days when we would wash it while it was long, I would spray it with Infusium and pantene leave in conditioner, then once it was dry, work a small dab of tea tree oil into it.  She really has beautiful hair, but it's been work on my part.  When she would go to her dad's for the weekend, she would go all weekend without brushing it or anything. His mother would try to fix it for her, but she would have no part of that.  "" Only momma can do my hair!"" Needless to say if she happened to stay 2 days it was a mess, especially if she went outside playing and I guess I'll never forget the time she went rolling in the hay over there. What a mess that hair was!  She's loving her new haircut..she thinks she's big now. I hope the kids at school today like it too!

After the haircut last night, I got her in the tub to take a bath and came in the next room to finish posting some stuff on Ebay.  Next thing I know she was screaming for me to come there and of course I rushed in there and found her leg bleeding a little. She wouldn't tell me why, but I quickly figured it out.. She had snuck my razor out of the  cabinet and proceeded to shave both legs AND arms because as she put it, she was * As hairy as a gorilla* lol.   She just thought that she would act growny by shaving her legs since she got a new haircut that made her look older.  I reminded her that she was only 8 and 8 yr olds are never as hairy as a gorilla :) Now the razors are put on the TOP shelf instead of the bottom one. She's such a funny kid. 

We had friends that gave us the contents of an old shed this weekend.  The house was purchased at a tax sale, and the woman that lost the house just moved off and left everything. I was happy because I love looking for treasures in places like that. When I first walked in, it was a little overwhelming at first.. stuff everywhere, but it didnt take me long to start digging.  We found old yearbooks like crazy, at least 10 -12 of them.. stuff still in them such as awards and letters and report cards. Lots of books and teaching materials. Plastic bins full of clothes..decorations for Christmas and Halloween.  I went through and got what I wanted to sell on Ebay and Amazon.. on the way out I figured that I'd grab a couple of bins of those clothes and go through them once I got home.. what I didnt want to sell I could donate to the crisis center here.  Once I got home and started sorting stuff, I was THRILLED when I opened the boxes and there were brand new clothes, some still with tags on them.  Nearly ALL of them were Chelsea's size and what didn't fit her fit our niece who is a couple of years younger than chels.  I washed clothes all weekend!! Over all I wound up with about 12 pair of blue jeans for next year for her, all name brand too!  Several jackets, a pair of school pants, and several shirts for the summer.  I was going to have to buy her a fancy dress to wear to her girlscout father daughter dance next weekend.. and the VERY last thing that I pulled out of one of the boxes was a beautiful emerald green fancy dress with a lacy bodice in EXACTLY her size that fit her perfect.  All I could say was ""Thank you GOD!""   My niece ended up with a big plastic bin FULL of clothes, shorts, new socks still in the package, jackets, windsuits, even a few dresses. Pretty stuff and expensive too!!  
I even sold 2 of the books as soon as I got them posted on Amazon! :)"

"event","I'm thinking of getting a haircut soon.  My hair is nearly to my waist and not in very good condition since my last perm.  I feel like I need a change, but I dont know what.  Change has always scared me.. haircuts scare the shit out of me and I'm a beautician.. probably why it scares me!  I know that I wont go short, but perhaps somewhere between my shoulders and my bra strap, something with lots of layers maybe.. then perhaps I'll play with my color a little bit and maybe add sideswept bangs.  I have used my hair as a security blanket for way too long and I think that maybe I'd look ok if I get away from this 7th grade hairdo. 

I also bought some nail tips to put on. Thats something that I've never really worn.. one because my nail bed is flat and they don't stick well.. 2. I'm afraid they will bother me or get in my way working outside or something.   

Maybe this will help me in my daily battle with depression.  Forcing myself to take care of me and do something for myself. 

I'm open to any suggestions on haircuts.  If you give me your email I'll gladly send pictures of me with all my hair and welcome any and all suggestions on a cut."

"event","This morning I woke up to my internet not working.  People that know me know that's like.. HORRIBLE!! My sweet thang worked on it, couldnt figure out what it was, so I had to call the internet folks to come out.  I was surprised when the woman on the phone told me they would be right here.  J went on to work and he wasn't even out of the driveway good when my doorbell rang.  I unlocked it, opened it and there much to my surprise stood my daughters boyfriend.  No daughter, no grandbaby.. just the boyfriend.  I was all cheery ( I fake it well) and let him on in.. he doesn't say much.. VERY hard person to have a conversation with and I can talk to anyone, its even hard for me!  He came thru the den and went straight to the bathroom.. this is the person that has kept my daughter from us, he doesn't like me in the least, so all SORTs of thoughts were running through my head, like why is he here, is he here to kill me, stab me or shoot me or something.. just a VERY WEIRD thing to be happening at 8am in the morning.  For a brief moment I thought that I should call J and at least tell him that he was here, just incase he tried something stupid, but I didnt for fear that he might hear me on the phone.  He comes out of the bathroom and I offered him breakfast or something to drink.. he wanted Coffee.  He very normally sat at the table and actually drank 2 cups while I attempted a conversation. I made sure that I let him know that the cable men would be here any second and my aunt also, just incase he was thinking anything stupid.  Turned out that he was just killing time before a car place opened.. shame on me for thinking thoughts like that but at the same time I think it was my intuition talking to me!  I was definitely picking up bad vibes!! Very weird that he would choose here to kill time though.  He did tell me that he was working with his dad ( even though its 8am on a tuesday am) and that the grandbaby has 2 teeth now ( I wouldnt know since we have laid eyes on her since right after Christmas)  When the clock reached 9am he got his jacket and was on his way.. very strange. At least I'm not dead, hah.. 

The internet people showed up right after that, fixed my internet.. woohoo!!  they told me that the entire road was out but that I was the only one that called.. I told them that it must mean that I stay on the net too much and have no real life.. which is partially the truth sometimes! 

I couldn't sleep for anything last night.. laid there after some amazing sex (like always)and just couldnt sleep. Dogs barking outside like crazy!  I got up with my flashlight to go see, couldnt find anything, fixed me something to drink, walked around the house.. finally laid back down and it didn't take me long after that.  I woke up tired and sleepy this morning even after several cups of liquid energy. 

I need to make a trip to the post office, then to the beauty supply for a couple of items that I need for the shop this afternoon.  Hope everyone is doing good!"

"event","He added a twist to the haircut saga, he told me that his ear was sore and also his lip because I must have cut him when I was cutting his hair.. 
I just looked at him like he was crazy when I told him that I had the guard on the clippers the entire time.  He said, well you surely must have cut me with that on, because my lip is very sore ( i did his mustashe too)  It's IMPOSSIBLE to cut anyone with a guard on.. skin doesn't come in contact with the blades.. See, now I know he just wants to complain for the sake of complaining.  I told him last night that he has no confidence in anything that I do and I reminded him that it was strange that my EX boyfriend who is 10 yrs younger than him ONLY lets me cut his hair and he waits unti he is in town before he gets a haircut just because he doesn't trust anyone else.  Let him think about that for awhile, it will do him good :)

I think that i'm allergic to my toothpaste.  Crest extra whitening with that gritty stuff in it.  My tongue has been really sore with those little lie bumps on it the past week, which I thought was due to the viral infection from my chest cold. 
Now that i'm pretty much over the cold, I'm begining to think it's the toothpaste. A sore tongue is really aggravating!!  

We are under a Tornado watch today. The weather scares me a little sometimes, especially since that horrible tornado hit in Arkansas this weekend and that wasn't very far from us. If I see stuff like that on the news, it makes me stress a little bit. Especially if I'm at home by myself.  Years ago when the 3 kids and I were home alone, a big tree fell on my house and car during a storm like that, scary stuff! 

One of J's friends ( a fireman) committed suicide  yesterday in a local motel. He was in his mid 40's and seemed to have things going his way.  He was OCD though and like I told J, thats the number one way that people with OCD die, they kill themselves.  It's very sad.  Although I just have mild OCD, I do suffer from depression so I fully understand how some days are better than other days. Just sad though, especially with all the medicine they have out there now.  I know a minimal dose of my medicine makes me a much happier person."

"event","It's official... I HATE cutting my husbands hair! I have been doing hair since I was big enough to hold a pair of scissors, and professionally for about 13 years.  He is DEFINITELY the worse client that I have EVER had.  I told him last night that if he was a paying customer that I would tell him not to come back.  He's SOOO critical of his haircuts, and every single time that I have ever cut his hair I end up having to redo it at least twice because he finds something wrong.. 99% of the time it's something thats not wrong to even start with.  For some reason, I have the feeling that he does this just because it's me cutting it. When he wore a flat top he would complain about it not being totally straight ( I use a flat topper comb with a level in it for God's sake) When it's longer he complains that it's too much hair here or there OR that I've cut it too short, I even BUZZED it all off one time when he asked for it and he complained about that!  Last nights complaint was that "" He didn't know how I did it but somehow I moved his part"" and he stood in front of the mirror combing and looking and wetting and putting get on it over and over and did it again this morning.   When I tell him to go pay someone to cut his hair he says no, that he likes the way I cut it.  I asked him how come it was that I have customers.. GUY customers that will only let me do their hair, some work way off and wait until they get home, just so I can do their hair, I even have an ex bf who has really long hair and only lets me cut it and he waits until he is in from Colorado to get haircuts. So.. after saying all that I'm begining to think that it isn't me, but HIM just being overly critical of my work for some reason.  I've noticed that he even makes comments about the way I package certain things to mail off that I've sold on Ebay.. just critical.  I don't think he realizes how nice it makes someone feel when  you compliment them on something.. at least sometimes.  Ok, thats my rant for the day and I feel better now :)

Yesterday was such a beautiful day, full of clear skies and warm sunshine.  I got up early and did laundry, and housework like always before time for work :) I hung my sheets out on the line to dry, opened all the curtains so the wonderful sunshine could come in.  You could feel spring in the air and it makes me want to plant something when it's like that.  Today, its overcast and gloomy and rain expected.  I really enjoyed the beauty of the day yesterday. 

I spent the evening sorting girl scout cookies to deliver to their rightful owners this week. Boxes of cookies just everywhere around here.. it's that time of the year again. I did notice that you can buy different types of cookies in different parts of the country.  For instance, they stopped selling the lemon cookies here this year, but I think other places still have them.  They also have the same cookies, but with different names as I discovered when I found them listed on Ebay.. yes, you can buy GS cookies even on Ebay :)"

"event","Things in my world seem almost back to normal now that Chels feels so much better.  She is still a little droopy, but nothing like she was. It's very strange when you have a severely ADHD child that just lies around and although sometimes you think you'd welcome the break if they did that just ONCE in a while.. when they actually are down it's scary and you can't wait for them to be back to their old self again. 

We both caught her cold, or a cold.. I'm not surprised with the hospital full of sick folks like it was.  I'm very OCD about washing my hands, especially since I work with the public and you never know.  I literally have a bottle of alcohol gel in my car in a pump bottle, one in my purse and one in my shop, a little overboard?  probably!  Funny how hubby always shakes hands with EVERYONE, he also bites his nails and he came down with a cold the same time I did, even with me being so careful. So much for my hangups huh? :)

We worked in the yard yesterday, it was too pretty not to even though we were both coughing and sneezing.  I laid a brick walkway out of some antique bricks that I had or at least I started on it.. I still need to fill it in with rock in places and add dirt to the flower beds on each side.  It will be nice to be able to use that little gate now when it rains and not slop in the mud just to get through.  Hubby cut a persimmon tree down that came up right in the middle of the garden years ago and we also cleaned some brush out from under my clothes line in the back.  I plan to use that line today once my load of towels are finished..I love the smell of clothes after they have hung on the line.  It reminds me of my grandmother and how her sheets always smelled and her towels were always kinda stiff. Good memories for me. 

He wants to cut other trees in the front yard.  Sweet gum trees, which leave hundreds if not thousands of those awful sweet gum balls. For some reason our yard is full of them. You can't mow them, they are hard to rake, they hurt your feet if you step on them and they also roll out from under you quickly if you have shoes on and step on one.  My brother and I as kids would roll these little prickly things in the mud, let them dry and have one hell of a war, complete with forts and the whole 9 yards.. nothing like getting hit by a sweet gum bullet, lol. 

I posted some kids little tykes yard toys on our local freecycle group.  I was surprised at all the responses that I got that said things like * I want what you are giving away, call me* just blunt, sorta rude and didnt even ask me what type of shape it was in or anything. I did get one response from a lady who told me that she is in the process of adopting a sibling group and would love to have it if it was still available. Signed the email with both her and her husbands name.. I was impressed and emailed her back and told her that it was hers and also told her that my girls were adopted out of the system too so I knew how it was, it's not like you get showers or anything when you bring older kids home.  People kill me on that group and don't mind sending in requests for anything that crosses their mind. One man sent in something saying "" I would like a new computer""  Well hell, wouldn't we all I thought!  One lady listed a whole email full of things like it was the make a wish foundation, listing things that she wanted, such as a microwave, stove, bedroom suite.. dang people!!  I have some mattresses that are in great shape that I'd like to give to someone needy, but NOT someone that just wants them because they are free.

Well it's work time for this ol gal.."

"event","I've spent nearly a week with a very sick little munchkin, my 8 yr old.  She spend 2 days this week in the hospital trying to shake a bad viral infection like the flu, which left her dehydrated and very sick.  She took 2 bags of glucose and 2 bag things of antibiotics and around the clock mega doses of tylenol and motrin combo's before her fever ever broke.  We came home about 10 pm Thursday night after she told her doctor that she wanted out of * this dump* as she called it, lol.  I think she had all of the needles that she could stand.  I know that I sure was relieved to sleep in my own bed on my wonderful sheets instead of that plastic couch that smelled like someone's ass that I had to sleep on in her hospital room.  You know it's bad when you lie down and notice a toilet bowl freshner attached to the bottom of the hospital bed directly across from it. Over all though, we had a good stay, the nurses were nice to her and very attentive.  Now J and I have the crud.. not sure what it is exactly but coughing and congestion and that general yucky feeling. Little missy is much better now thank GOD!  playing around here in a halloween cat suit that she snooped and found in my ebay closet and claimed. Her legs are bothering her bad, they seem to be weak and she complains that they hurt bad when she walks. She's not walking normal but with her feet out like she's been riding a horse or something.. I thought that she was faking it yesterday, but obviously she isnt.  They seem to be sore when you touch the calf of them too. Guess I'll ask the doctor about it tomorrow when I go pick up her school excuse, but I can't imagine what's causing that. 

A lady that I cleaned house for nearly 10 yrs died this week.  She hadn't been the same since her husband died last year, then her dog a few weeks later.  I have alot of memories with her, always enjoyed her stories and admired her for the strong person that she was.  She died over the weekend, and since we dont get a newspaper on Sunday or Monday, I didnt know about it until after they buried her.  Funny, I was thinking about her a couple of days before she died and drove by her house to see if she was there.. strange cars were in the driveway, blinds were up which she never did.. for some reason I thought that she had moved or had company so I didnt stop.. wish now that I had.  My memories with her and her husband will forever be in my mind though. 

Tomorrow we were suppose to have J's family over but to be honest, I didnt feel like the bother so I got him to call and cancel.  With us both under the weather and Chels just out of the hospital, I didnt feel like cooking, cleaning or entertaining.  They weren't bringing anything, didnt offer to and the last time they were all here ( christmas)  I was sick as a dog with the stomach virus and none of them lifted a hand to do squat except eat.  I cooked and did the dishes after they all ate. Not this time.. I'm learning to say no and not feel guilty about doing it. Freedom :)  thats what it feels like!

I'm reading "" A purpose driven life"" at the request of a friend of mine.  It's a good book :) 

I've also started a new crochet blanket for Chels with a color that she picked out, variations of hot pink, light pink and purple.  I got alot done on it in the hospital but ran out of yarn.   I remember when you could buy yard for one dollar.. well, not any more!  She's trying to learn to crochet too and every critter on the place is sporting a new collar or leash, lol. 

I made a huge pot of yummy homemade chicken soup while ago with an entire package of wide egg noodles in it.. J said it was the best soup ever. I'm a vegetarian, but I do eat stuff with meat, just pick the meat out.  I'm definitely going to have to write down what I put in this so that I can remember. 

I dreamed that I was fishing and caught an alligator with my Dad's old open face reel, after it backlashed on me a few times.  Strange, maybe it's this cold making me dream crazy!

The wind is blowing so hard here now that it blew our neighbors porch right off her house while ago!"

"event","My little one has been sick since Friday, thank goodness they were out Friday and Monday, but she is home today, still running a temp of almost 102.  Why is it that kids always seem to get sick at night or over the weekend?  No doctors in sight unless you take them to the ER. I couldnt sleep any of those nights until her fever broke or went down, so I'm sleepy this morning :) I took her to the doctor yesterday, he gave her zithromycin (sp) some cold medicine and told me to give her Motrin for the fever.  She woke up this morning with a very pink little face,weak eyes, coughing, stopped up and her fever almost 102.  He stuck her finger and said nothing major was showing up, whatever that means..but it still worries you when they've had a hot fever for 4-5 days like this. 

I finally spoke to my friend that I haven't talked to in years.. we talked for hours this weekend on the phone.  I found out that she is addicted to Tylenol PM. That's a strange thing to be addicted to I think and the first time I've heard of anyone being hooked on something like that. I enjoyed our conversation and we got caught up on our lives and what's been going on all these years.  She actually fell asleep on me while we were talking, guess the tylenol kicked in or something. 

I had shot glasses that sold this weekend on Ebay for 50 bucks, I paid 1 dollar for them so yay!!! 

Must get up from here and stir around some, the longer I sit the sleeper I get!"

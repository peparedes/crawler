When I made my LJ a year ago, I needed to think up a name, and at the time Hanson's ""A Song to Sing"" was playing, so I just picked it from there.

So expect a new name from me in the coming weeks.  And also let me know if you wanna stay on my friends list.

"event","So Michelle and her boyfriend were here this week.  It was so good to see her!  I haven't seen her in over a year, and I probably won't see her until close to Gina's wedding in two years.  But it was a fun week.

Sunday, I had to work until 6.  Gina, Michelle, and Reinier met me at work.  We met up with Gina's brother and his girlfriend, and the 6 of us went into the North End for dinner.  We had dinner, and walked around for awhile.  LOL Reinier has never been to New Englad before, so he was taking pictures of EVERYTHING!  It was amusing.

Monday, we went to Canobie Lake Park.  It was me, my brother, Gina, Matt, Michelle, Reinier, Matt's sister, Brian, and Tom. It was a fun day, as Canobie always is (LOL Bridgette).  I think the most amusing thing was watching Ryan and Brian chugging beers.  And all of Ryan's voice notes LMAO.  

Wednesday I went into Boston with Gina, Matt, Michelle, and Reinier.  (Yes, I felt like the 5th wheel, which was so kindly pointed out to me when the comment was made that I was ""the only girl there without a man.""  Thanks bunches.  But thank God for Reinier, who was the only one who seemed to notice how uncomfortable parts of the day were for me.)  Anyhow, the 5 of us did the Duck Tours.  LOL I felt like such a tourist in my own city!  But it was fun.  After the Duck Tour, we hung around the commons and walked around.  (Pictures to come next week when I get them developed.)  Reinier was so funny!  He has never seen squirrels or pigeons before, so every time he saw them, he would chase after them and take pictures.  It made for an amusing afternoon.

Friday, the 4 of them went whale watching.  I had to work, so I couldn't go.  While I would have loved to have had one last day with Michelle and Reinier, I was kind of glad that I couldn't go.  It's kind of awkward hanging out with your 2 friends and their boyfriends.  Especially after the comment that was made on Wednesday.  Anyhow, they did come by Marshalls to day goodbye cuz they left today.  I'm gonna miss my Michelle!  But at least I got to see her, and it was a fun week.

OK, I'm out.  I'm friggin exhausted and I have the pleasure of working all day tomorrow.

"event","What could possibly possess someone to take their own life?  What could be so bad that ending your life seems like the only way to deal with it?  I just don't get it, maybe because I don't think that way.  Getting a call from your best friend saying that an old high school classmate has done just that kinda of makes you think.  I've barely spoken more than 2 words to him since the end of my junior year of high school (since the day he and Adam went too far and actually made me cry) but it still affects me.  And it affects my friends, and that kills me.  I keep thinking about how he used to tease me every single day in English class.  He was friends with my brother, so my brother told him to make fun of me (cuz at the time, my brother didn't like my boyfriend).  So every day, he would tease me.  And then at lunch, he and my brother sat behind me and would tease me every day.  But it was all in fun, ya know?  It made me laugh.  

His death was such a shock, and I still can't believe it happened.  Hopefully I'll remember him as the kid who used to make me laugh, and not as the kid who took the ""easy way out.""

My thoughts and prayers to your family, and all the friends who will miss you."

"event","I've been so lazy lately.  I hardly ever update, and when I do, it's usually just dumb quizzes and stuff.  Then again, there is nothing really going on in my life that is particularly exciting.  I work, and that's about it.  But the next two weeks are going to be awesome!  Tomorrow I'll get to see Michelle!  If there is anyone that reads this that doesn't know Michelle, she is one of my best friends.  She moved to Las Vegas when I was 14, and I haven't seen her in over a year.  Gina and I went out there to visit her last May and that was the last time I saw her.  Before we all got so busy with college and everything, Michelle used to come back to Weymouth for most of the summer every year, but she hasn't been here since summer of 2001.  So I'm wicked excited to see her!  Her boyfriend is coming with her too.  He's cool.  She'll only be here for a week, but at least I get to see her.  I'm so excited!!  I know Michelle, her boyfriend, Gina, and I are going out to dinner tomorrow night, and then we (along with Matt, Brian, and Tom) are going to Canobie on Monday.  *snicker*  That'll be a good time.

Next week is gonna be amazing as well... it's my Hanson week!  I am seeing them in concert on the 19th, the 20th, and the 22nd.  I'm so excited, only Jen understands my extreme amounts of excitement!  LOL and Amy I HAVE to meet Taylor!

"event","I'm so tired, but it's too early for me to go to bed.  Plus, I took a nap a little while ago, so I'm not really sleepy, just tired.  I'm supposed to have the day off tomorrow, but Dawn asked me today if I would be willing to work 5-close tomorrow night.  Sure, why not?  If you count working at the dentist office, I haven't had a day off since last Tuesday, and now I won't have one off til Friday.  But I got Friday and Saturday night off, so it's all good.

Yesterday I pushed my car and made it take me to Maine.  LOL.  My poor little Chiquita broke down on me last Monday and then I drove her to Maine last night.  I'm surprised she didn't blow up on me then and there.

So yeah, I went to Maine last night to see Gary and Jamie.  It was fun.  I was all proud of myself for not getting lost!  Anyhow, at 9:00 last night, I got a phone call saying I should go up there.  I was kinda iffy about it, cuz I didn't think my parents would go for me driving up there by myself at that time of night, and because I had to work at 10 AM today.  But, I was guilt-tripped into it (lol just kidding Gary ;)  ).  I got there at about 11:30ish.  We drank and talked for awhile, and eventually went to bed.  It was after 3 AM by the time I fell asleep, and then my alarm on my cell went off at 5:30 AM.  I had to make sure I had enough time to get home and get ready for work.  I ended up getting home a little after 8 this morning.  So I took a quick nap before work.  LOL who takes a nap at 8 in the morning?

So then I spent the entire day at work trying to figure out what was wrong with me, cuz something just didn't feel right.  It was too quiet in my area, so I got to do a lot of thinking.  I realized some things that I didn't want to realize and now I'm pissed at myself.

And that brings us to now.  And now I'm out cuz my sister just called to ask me something, and apparently she is gonna be home in a few minutes, and then we have to chat.

Lata kiddies!

"event","So about that party Saturday night. LMAO.  Ryan kept telling me that I was going, and my mom kept telling me that I should go.  Ryan wouldn't tell me where it was, just that it was out near Springfield.  He wouldn't tell me who was having it, just that it was some guy that he used to work with.  Around 4:00, I started to get a little suspicious.  I thought it was weird that Ryan wouldn't tell me where exactly we were going, none of my friends were coming here, and Ryan had been talking to Kristi and Lynette a lot lately.  I kept my suspicions to myself and said I'd go.

We left here around 5ish on Saturday, so we should have been ""near Springfield"" by 7/7:30ish.  BUT, we had crappy directions and got lost.  So it was more like 8:30 when we got there.  ""There"" turned out to be Kristi's house in East Longmeadow.  My roomies threw me a surprise party!  And it wasn't just any old party - it was a kegger!  All the girls (minus Kat) were there, plus Brian and Adam from Danvers, and Erin's sister and some of her friends from Queens.  It was awesome!

It was obvious that Lynette was drinking when we walked in.  LOL every yells ""surprise"" and ""Happy Birthday"" and all that, and Lynette yells, ""Happy Birthday!  Look, we even got you presents and made you a cake and everything!""  LOL she later told me that she was getting pissed that we were late because all she wanted to do was tap the keg LMAO.  

So I am no longer pissed that my friends didn't come down this weekend, because the reason they didn't is because they threw me a party!  And a damn good party it was!  The Condo 6 girls know how to party!  LOL we kicked that keg's ass!  I can't wait til the next one.  LOL Kristi said we need two kegs next time.

<b><u>Party Highlights:</u></b>
--Playing Flip Cup for the first time and actually not sucking!
--Team Cotter (Me and Ryan) playing Team Harnisher (Erin and her sister) in Flip Cup at least 20 times
--Lynette spraining her ankle cuz she was drunk and jumping on the trampoline.

"event","Last night was fun!  (As I sit here munching on cold chicken fingers.  You know, these things are just as good cold as they are hot.)  I went to Kam's Garden with Maggie and Ryan.  We each had a scorpion bowl (so much better than the Tiki Palace) and 2 beers.  And chicken fingers.  After Wednesday, and my nasty hangover Thursday, I was afraid to drink much.  But I still had fun.  We got to listen to drunk people sing karaoke, which was freakin hilarious!  Some of them just really shouldn't be singing!  But they amused me.

I'm not sure what I'm doing the rest of this weekend.  Ryan is going to a party in western MA that a guy he used to work with is throwing.  He invited me to go with him.  Actually, he did more than invite me... he told me he was going to drag me there.  LOL.  I haven't decided yet if I'm going.  My parents are going to a wedding tonight, Erin will probably be out, and Brendan might be out (but even if he were home, he'd be in his bedroom anyhow).  I'd almost rather sit here alone and wallow.

So that's the plan for tonight - either going to a party with Ryan, or sitting here and doing something.  And tomorrow is Father's Day, so I'll be going to my grandparents' house, which is always a good time.

"event","So continuing in the birthday celebration, my dad took me out on Wednesday.  LOL I got to go on the Barhoppers' Tour of Norwood!  We went to Conrads for lunch and had some beers.  Then we went to this other bar (I can't remember the name) for another beer.  Then we went to Concannons and had a few beers.  Then we went to the VFW where I got wasted.  LOL my dad knew everyone there, so they just kept buying me more drinks.  I got to the point where if I had anymore, I'd start being drunk and retarded.  At this point, my dad went outside to use his cell phone, and when he came in, someone was buying me shots of peppermint schnapps.  I was GONE!  I think that was when I told Uncle Steve that he needed to get some Hanson in the jukebox.  Anyhow, we left at about 8:00.  I came home and acted stupid for awhile, and then passed out.  Good times... except for having to work at 8:00 Thursday morning, and having the nastiest hangover all day.  Not fun.

Tonight, I'm going to Kam's with Ryan and Maggie.  Yay for chicken fingers and Scorpion Bowls!

This entire weekend is gonna suck.  Even though I really can't afford it, I took today, Saturday, and Sunday off from work cuz people were supposed to come visit me for my birthday.  But what do you know, that's not happening.  So during a weekend that was supposed to be spent celebrating MY birthday, I'll sitting in my house doing nothing (except for tonight, and Sunday which is my mom's birthday, and Father's Day at my grandparents' house).  But you know, who cares?  This is the second year in a row I've gotten shitted on for my birthday so fuck it all.  No more taking days off cuz it's just a waste.  I'm gonna stop now before I say something I really regret, because you know, I'm in one of those moods where I would, and I don't friggin give a damn."

"event","So my 21st birthday was yesterday! *claps*  It was so much fun and I could totally get used to being 21!  I had a blast!

I woke up at 10:35 yesterday morning, 14 minutes after I officially turned 21.  I lazed around the house all day, which was fun and relaxing.  Gina came over around 3:30 and I got to open up my first 21st birthday present.  She got me 21 presents and matched them to 21 reasons why we are friends.  It was so cute!  A few of the things are inside jokes, but they were still funny.  She got me:
1. cucumber melon body spray (one of my favorite scents!)
2. a Precious Moments perfume bottle (easily my favorite gift cuz I LOVE PM.)
3. A cupcake scented candle
4. a cow piggy bank (LOL the note said ""Why do you spend all your money on cow things?""  I didn't make the connection between money and a piggy bank until a half an hour later.)
5. an ice cream bowl cuz I looooove ice cream!
6. citrus scented bath salts
7. a martini glass (SO perfect for me!)
8. an orange light bulb (LOL inside joke)
9. a hair clip with curly blonde hair attached to it (LOL for all my dumb blonde moments, as evident in gift #4)
10. A stuffed frog with crossed eyes! (My mom and I decided to call the frog Ruby Sue from the Vacation movies... LOL)
11. a  cute purse (LOL cuz I don't have enough of them already!)
12. a lilac blossom Yankee Candle car freshener
13. a cute photo album cuz I take so many pictures!
14. glow in the dark SpongeBob Band-Aids (LOL inside joke)
15. cow socks with little cow head pom poms on the back
16. purple flip flops to go with my already large collection of flip flops
17. a bag of Reeses Pieces (inside joke)
18. a hot pink bra (LMAO another inside joke)
19. a bottle of my favorite shampoo (cuz in 12th grade, she used to pat my head every day and tell me how soft my hair was)
20. an assignment book (inside joke... and so I can keep track of when to go out drinking!)
21. pretty blue topaz earrings.

So those were my gifts from Gina!  Jen also stopped by.  She got me 21 scratch tickets!  LOL I won 7 dollars!  It's gonna be saved in my fund for buying Hanson tour merchandise at the (3 definite, 3 more possibly) Hanson concerts I am going to this summer.  LOL or I can use it for my first packie run (which has yet to happen).

So then I went out to Applebees for dinner with Gina, my mom, and my sister.  Me, Gina, and my mom got mudslides (my first LEGAL drink!) and poor Erin had to get a diet pepsi.  I got a free dessert cuz it was my birthday!  Good for me!

After dinner I went to my grandparents' house.  LOL we have this family joke with my grandmother.  We recycle and reuse old cards, or we give random cards for the wrong events.  Grammy gave me a card that my cousin gave my grandfather for his 80th birthday last year.  LOL I'm gonna give it back to him for Father's Day.  Then Grammy gave me a real card with money and a Precious Moments doll!  I was so excited!  It's a little boy dressed up as a scarecrow and I love it!

Around 9:30 we headed out to the bar.  I went to Chilis with Ryan and Gina, and we met John there.  LOL one of the waitresses came over and asked whose birthday it was, because John said he would be there that night for a birthday.  LOL he's a regular there!  Anyhow, Ryan told me to order a Margarita Presidente, so I did.  It was so good!  And being the Condo 6 lush that I am, I downed it.  After that I had a good ol' Bud Light.  And being the awesome big brudda that he is, Ryan paid for my drinks!

Chilis closes at 11 on Monday nights, so then we went to Tiki Palace, cuz Ryan had a smart idea of going for scorpion bowls.  Oh man were they good!  Especially drinking one with some chicken fingers!  So I downed that one and then went for the beer again.  Matt and Millhouse met us there and had a few drinks with us.  We left there at about 12:30, cuz I had to work at 8 this morning and Ryan was SUPPOSED to work at 6... LOL

Work today wasn't too bad.  I was more tired than anything else.  My dad called my cell on his way home from work this morning to see if I had fun last night... OBVIOUSLY I DID!  Also, he wanted to know my schedule for the week, cuz he wants to take me to Norwood for some drinks Thursday night.  NICE!  Ryan decided he wants to come too.  Drinking with my dad AND my brother!  AWESOME!

Karen from the dentist office called today, and finally caught me when I was home.  She told me what projects she needs to do this summer and asked if I'd wanna help out.  So I gotta figure out my schedule at Marshalls, and then I'll be working at the dentist office too!

OK, I'm out.  I've got some shit to get done.  After Brendan's baseball game tonight, we are doing my birthday cake with the family cuz it was too crazy to do it yesterday.  Yay I love cake!

Lata kids!

"event","I hate my job.  I swear, Marshalls exists just to piss me off.  My 21st birthday is this coming Monday, which means I plan on being totally wasted that night.  I asked for Tuesday off from work cuz obviously I'm not gonna wanna go into work that day.  Well, I checked the schedule today, and I am scheduled 8-2 the day after my birthday.  What the shit is that??  It's one thing if they want me to work that night or something, but 8 AM the day after my 21st birthday?  Well, all I can say is they better not expect too much outta me that day.  Screw them.

Oh well, I did get next weekend off.  So people had better be coming to see me to celebrate my birthday.  Cuz if people break promises on my birthday AGAIN this year, I'm not gonna be a happy camper.  Anyone who wants to come to Weymouth is more than welcome!  LOL spread the word!

Karen from the dentist office called back today, but I didn't get the message until after she left the office for the day.  Hopefully I can get a hold of her tomorrow.  She said she has some projects that I can work on this summer.  Cool with me, it pays more than Marshalls (I've been there for 3 years and I barely make 8 bucks an hour... cheap bastards), and it's easier.

OK, so I had this weird dream yesterday.  It's behind the cut, if you wanna read it and help me figure out what it means! 

<lj-cut text=""My dream"">So my dream starts off with me, Maggie, and Lynette.  We were going to an FPC basebal game, but it wasn't on the real baseball field.  If you know anything about the FPC campus, the field was at the other end of College Road, where Campus Safety is.  To get to the field, you had to go inside this house, and walk up all these flights of stairs, and the field was at the top of the house, outside.  It was like on a hill, and you had to go through the house and up all the stairs to get to the top of the hill.  The weird thing is that it was nighttime on the field, but daytime at the bottom of the house.  Weird.  So anyhow, Lynette, Maggie and I went to the field where we met up with Jen, Bridgette, Kristi, and Jamie.  We were watching the game, and my cell phone rang.  I turned around and walked a few feet away to talk.  While I was turned, everyone snuck away on me.  When I got off the phone, I couldn't find them, so I walked around the whole field.  Still couldn't find them, so I went down the stairs to College Road, but I still couldn't find them.  So I went back up to the field and saw Jen.  She saw me, and ran to tell the rest of them and they all ran off.  I ran to catch up to them, and they said they didn't mean to lose me.  

So the dream continues, and it ended up being just me, Maggie, and Lynette again.  We were at the bottom of the stairs, outside the house on College Road.  Out of nowhere, Maggie started yelling at me, telling me I was a horrible friend, and I was the biggest bitch in the world.  I looked to Lynette for backup, and she goes, ""Well, I didn't know how to tell you this, but she's right.  You are a bitch and I haven't wanted to be your friend for awhile.""  I asked why, and she said she has secretly always wanted *someone* and was pissed that I slept with this someone.  She said she has wanted to hurt me ever since.  So then I look to my left and I see this *someone* running down College Road with a shotgun.  I tried to run away, but y'know how you can never run in your dreams?  Yeah, well I had that problem.  Anyhow, I ran inside the building, and Maggie and Lynette chased me.  I ran up the stairs, but they caught up and threw me headfirst out a fifth story window, but I landed feet first on the ground in some mud up to my waist.  And I ended up losing my shoes.  I ran around the side of the building and up College Road, toward campus.  Maggie and Lynette ran after me, and since I can't run in my dreams, they caught up to me.  They held me down and *someone* came up the hill, and told me that I was a bitch and had to die.  Then he shot me and I died... and he and Lynette got married with my body right there.  The End.

"event","I don't have much to talk about today.  So let's talk about Hanson!  After the Penny and Me single came out, they had been on the ProFM Top 9 at 9.  They didn't get very far, and then fell off the countdown.  So this morning, I don't know why, I decided to check the Top 9 at 9 standings on the ProFM website.  Well, imagine my surprise when I see this weeks average and I see ""Penny and Me"" sitting in number 4.  Holy wow, I was excited, sad as it sounds.

And now for more excitement.  Gina called me last night about the Marshalls schedule for next week.  Apparently I was only given TWO DAYS next week.  Granted, I did ask for Monday, Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday off.  But there are still THREE days left in the week.  Damn it Dawn, you know I'm a poor college kid!  Needless to say, I'm pissed.  But that's not the exciting part.  I got home from work today, and there was a message on the machine from Karen at the dentist office.  She was calling to ask if I would be able to work this summer.  YAY!!!!  I'll have to see what the deal is with my internship (I swear this guy is avoiding me!), and then maybe I can squeeze in some time at the dentist office.  I would love to work there again!  It's such easy money, and I loved working there last summer.  So we shall see what happens.  Either way, I need to make money!  I'm going broke!!!

OK, I'm out.  I've got nothing interesting to talk about, seeing as my life is in fact not interesting.  Plus, I have to get up early cuz I'm helping Grammy babysit Genevieve tomorrow!!  Lata kids!

"event","I'm feeling SO much better.  Thank God for the drugs the doctor gave me.  My back doesn't hurt at all anymore, thank goodness.  I couldn't take much more of that bullshit!

I saw the new Harry Potter movie Friday night.  I like it, but I'll admit I was a little disappointed.  I thought the new Dumbledore looked like a homeless bum, the castle looked like a rundown dump, there was a serious lack of magic, half the book was missing (which I expected, but they left out some big things), and it strayed too far from the book.  And dude, Pettigrew is supposed to be wasting away, but he was FAT!  Overall, I enjoyed it, even though I was disappointed.

I haven't worked since Friday.  I'm convinced they're punishing me for something.  Either for calling in sick twice last week (after I've been working there for 3 years and have never called out), or because I took off 4 days next week for various things pertaining to my 21st birthday.  (only 7 more days!)  So this week, I'm working Tuesday 8-2, Thursday 8-2 and Friday 8-2.  That's 18 hours, coming off of working full time since I've been home.  And then I was looking at the schedule, and there are more new people.  This is crap man.  I'm having another FUCK YOU MARSHALLS moment, and Barbara doesn't even work there anymore!  Grrrrrr

OK, I'm gonna go watch RAW now.  My hottie Edge was just on TV :)

Lata kids!

"event","So last Friday my back started hurting.  I assumed I just pulled something at work, took some ibuprofen, and forgot about it.

Saturday I had the day off from work and I went to my little cousin's birthday party.  My back hurt a little, but not really.  It was kind of like a pain that wasn't really noticable but it was enough to make me slightly uncomfortable.  It really started bothering me after dinner Saturday night, so I threw a heating pad on it and it felt better after awhile.

Sunday the back pain was getting worse, but I took some more ibuprofen and it went away eventually.

Monday it started to get fun.  I had a little bit of pain Monday morning, so I took some ibuprofen and off to work I went.  When I got home from work at 4:00, the pain was coming back.  Plus, I had the uncontrollable shakes, and I was freezing.  I thought I might have a fever, so I took some ibuprofen and took a nap.  I woke up about 2 hours later and felt better, so I didn't think anything of it.  I watched RAW and went to bed.

I woke up Tuesday morning feelinf kinda groggy.  Took more ibuprofen (I should invest in that shit... LOL) and went off to work.  I was feeling kinda off all day, almost like I was in a fog.  I took my final break at 2:00, and I drank some juice and ate a piece of carrot cake for Debbie's birthday.  I went back downstairs afterwards, and I was FREEZING.  And it is usually wicked hot in the back room.  I started feeling really dizzy and sick to my stomach.  So I sat on the floor and processed the things in boxes.  Christine came in around 3:00 and told me to go home.  I was gonna try to fight through that last hour, but I knew I couldn't do it.  So I left.  When I got home, I staggered up to my room, and fell asleep from 3:30ish til 10:30ish.  And apparently I was crying in my sleep, which goes to show how much pain I was in.  I woke up around 10:30, just in time to receive a drunk phone call from Lynette (LMAO).  I took some more ibuprofen and passed out again.

Wednesday I woke up around 7:00 to call in sick to work.  Christine was the opening manager, which was good cuz she sent me home the day before cuz she knew I wasn't feeling well.  The pain in my back was even more intense and I couldn't deal with it.  I whimpered myself back to sleep, with the heating pad on my back.  I woke up around 11:30, and I couldn't stand to be in my room anymore, so I moved to the living room.  I felt as though I had a fever, but I didn't feel as bad as I did on Monday, so I ignored it.  I laid on the couch all day, napping off and on and practically convulsing the whole time.  Seriously, I couldn't even stand the pain.  My mom came home from work at 4:00, and told me she was taking me to the hospital after Brendan's baseball game.  That wouldn't be until about 8:30, but I figured I had made it this long, what's a few more hours?I could barely move by that point, and when my sister got home around 7 she practically dragged me out the door to the hospital.  Thank God for her!

By the time we got to the hospital, it was about 7:30.  We had to stand in line for about 5-10 minutes to check in.  It was the longest I had stood up all day, and I was starting to feel dizzy and I couldn't breathe.  We got up to the desk and I was leaning on it just to keep upright.  The lady was taking all of my information and I was like, I'm gonna pass out.  Erin was watching me, and she later told me that all of a sudden all the color just drained from my face, I went white as a ghost, and sweat started pouring down my face (ewww!).  The lady put the bracelet on my wrist and told me to go sit.  Right when I started to move, everything went blurry, and I couldn't move.  It took every ounce of strength I had to not pass out.  I had never been so scared in my life.  Erin had to pactically drag me to a seat.  I sat down, and Erin held my bottle of water to my forehead until I was ok.  I looked at my arms and I had never seen them so white.  I was shaking and covered with sweat.

Around 8, the nurse called me in to get some info on my symptoms.  I told her what was going on, and she said it sounded like I had a UTI.  She took my temperature (which I found out today from Erin was 102), gave me some tylenol, took some samples, and told me to go back out into the lobby.  We went back out, and my mom got there a little while later.  Erin called work for me and told them that I wouldn't be in the next day.  She left a little while later, after she helped take care of my damn bloody nose (I swear, every time I am in that damn hospital I get a bloody nose!).  My mom told me I should I have passed out when I had the chance, cuz we were stuck sitting there until 1:15 AM when a doctor would finally see me.

So at 1:15 I finally made it in to see the doctor.  A nurse came in and told me that I had a kidney infection (oh yay).  She took my temp again, which was now down to a 96 (tylenol works wonders).  Then the doctor came in, and asked how long I had been sick, and how long I had a fever.  Stupid me was like, I had a fever?  He told me that I had a UTI, and since it wasn't treated, it moved to my kidneys.  The weird thing is, I didn't have any of the UTI symptoms until that morning.  So then the nurse came in and took some blood samples, and hooked me up to an IV with antibiotics.  I was the happiest kid alive when she came in and shot some painkillers into the IV too.  I started to feel really nauseous, like I was gonna be sick, but it passed within a few minutes, thank God.  When the IV was done, the doctor came in to see if I was feeling ok.  I said I felt better, and he asked if I was sure cuz I still looked really pale.  My mom goes, Oh she always looks like that.  (LOL it's true.)  So the doctor started cracking jokes.  He was amusing me.  He asked if I felt ok enough to go home or did I want to spend the night.  I was like hell no, get me outta here!  So the nurse came in, told me my blood tests were normal and I could go once she wrote up some prescriptions.  I got prescriptions for antibiotics and vicodins. Wooo.  We finally made it home a little before 2:30 AM.

Today I woke up feeling so much better.  I'm still not anywhere near feeling 100%, but I feel so much better than I did.  I got my drugs this afternoon, and they told me that I have to drink a full glass of water with the antibiotics, take them on an empty stomach, and not have any dairy for 2 hours afterwards.  And the vicodin I have to take with either food or milk.  How does that work?  I have to take the antibiotics twice a day, and they are more important, so if I take them and I'm in pain at the same time, I have to deal with the pain for awhile.  Thank God the pain isn't nearly as bad as it was.  It still hurts a little, but at least I can move now and I have pain killers!

Yep, so that's why I was sick.  I had a fever and a freakin kidney infection.  I'm not gonna die Lynette!  The only bad thing is now I have to go back to work tomorrow.  Oh well, at least I don't have to deal with the customers tomorrow!

Alright, I'm out.  Time to go be lazy on the couch.  Lata kids!

"event","So I had the entire weekend off from work.  And what did I do?  NOTHING.  The highlight of my weekend was definitely going to see Shrek 2 today.  So funny!

Friday I worked til 4.  It was my sister's prom, so I hung around here and did the whole family pictures thing.  My sister looked AWESOME!!!  Seriously man, she looked absolutely beautiful.  (Pictures tomorrow).  Then when she was gone, I went to a jewelry party with my mom and my grandmother at my grandmother's neighbor's house.  It was fun.

Saturday I went to my little cousin's birthday party.  Stayed there til 6ish, then came home and watched movies for the rest of the night.

Sunday (today) I went shopping with Mom and Gina.  Tonight I saw Shrek 2 with Mom, Gina, and Brendan.  It was friggin awesome!  I loved it!  Mom and I are already planning to go see it again.

I just wish my weekend was more interesting.  It's very rare that I get a Saturday or Sunday off from work, never mind both of them.  So I was kinda bummed that I didn't do much.  I tried to get people to come visit me, but no such luck.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  But Shrek made up for an otherwise dull and crappy weekend.  Such a good movie!

Alright, I'm out.  Back to work in the AM.

And of course Ryan has to call from Florida and tell us that the sun is shining, it's 90 degrees and he is sweating his balls off.  FUCK YOU RYAN!  Thank God he's coming home tonight.  I missed my big bruddah!

So work today was thrilling.  No, not really, but at least I was out back again all day, except when I had to cover the fitting room for Ellie's lunch.  I love being in the back room, cuz I don't have to deal with the customers!  I talked to Dawn Monday night, and she said she was giving me 8:00-4:00 all next week, which means... I HAVE THE ENTIRE WEEKEND OFF!  This excites me to no end.  AND I'll be out back again next week, which is just as exciting.

Dawn makes me love my job!

Let's see, what else has been going on...

I hung out with Matt Monday night.  We went to dinner at Friendly's, which is always fun.  Then we were bored, so we drove to TJ Maxx to see John.  Holy God, it was weird.  I haven't been in there in forever, and I can't believe it's been almost 4 years since we all left.  Good lord.

Blah... nothing much is going on.  I've got the entire weekend off of work, and nothing to do.  I could go to my little cousin's birthday party Saturday.  And my mom and I have a date to see Shrek 2 either this weekend or next week.  It's gonna be a long summer if I'm this bored already!

"event","I got my grades today.  My heart was pounding when I saw the envelope.  All semester, I was stressing, I felt like I wasn't keeping up, and I felt like I was doing horrible.  So I get my grades today and discovered that all that stressing was a waste!  This semester and last semester were my two best semesters (grade wise), and they were the 2 semesters I was most nervous about!

My grades are:
Reason and Romanticism - B
Science of Society - B+
Intermediate Accounting - B+
Individual Income Taxes - A-
Auditing - A-

I almost peed my pants when I saw my Auditing grade.  That's the one class that I was so worried about.  Although, I don't know what there was to be so nervous about.  Ben Gardiner is the best teacher EVER!!!

Anyways...

Ryan called from Florida a little while ago. They're having fun, probably cuz they got drunk last night, and there are ""hot slizz"" at their hotel.  They went to Magic Kingdom today.   Ryan was saying that the characters in Alice in Wonderland were signing autographs.  He wanted to ask Alice to sign his helmet.  And he wanted to toss Minnie's salad.  Yup, that's my big brother!

OK, I gotta get moving.  I'm pulling another split shift today, and I gotta get some stuff done before I go back to work at 5.

Lata kida!

"event","So I'm sick again.  What is wrong with me this year?  I got sick on New Year's Eve and wasn't feeling well again until the beginning of February.  (And I don't mean not feeling well... I mean sleeping all day, not eating, and throwing up every day kind of sick.  And my ears were blocked for weeks.  As I'm sure everyone remembers from my pissy LJ entries.)  So yeah, I feel like hell again.  It could just be my allergies, but it's still killing me.  I passed out on my couch at 3:30 this afternoon, and didn't wake up til 8:00.  I slept all afternoon yesterday too.  I got a good night's sleep last night too, so I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.

Blah.

Nothing much has been going on.  I've been working mornings all week, which is wonderful.  Tomorrow, I have to work 8-12, and then again from 5-close.  I did it on Tuesday too, and it's really not that bad.

Tuesday was fun.  Jamie and Gary came down and we drank at Millhouse's.  It was great fun.  Except when I got thrown in the pool.  (Don't laugh Amanda!)  Gary picked me up and started carrying me towards the pool.  I knew what he was going to do, but I didn't think he was actually going to throw me in!  Well, he did, and I was fully clothed (and drunk).  So then I went back to beer pong while soaked in jeans and a semi see-through shirt.  NOT CONFORTABLE WHEN WORN WET!  Maybe that's why I don't feel well.  Oh well, it was pretty fun.

I got my hours for next week:
Sunday 11-6:30
Monday 8-2
Tuesday 8-2
Wednesday 8-2
Thursday 8-2
Friday 8-2
Saturday off

Looks like it will be an ok week.  OK, I'm gonna go take a shower and try to feel better.  Lata kids!

"event","So my Amy IMs me last night and decides to tell me a story.  And the story was so wonderful that I just had to share.  *hugs to Amy*




<b>So you want someone to entertain you? Okay I'll entertain you (i'd sent Tay to give you lap dance but he's a little worn out hehe). So, I'll tell you a little story because everyone LOVES a good story. So, once upon a time, there was this SUPER hot Princess chick named, Meghan, but everyone called her Meggie. Well Meggie was the hottest chick on the block, unfortunately the equally hot Prince Taylor which Meggie was suppose to marry was taken by the Wicked Witch of the South[insert canned boo-ing here] & her name was Gnatalie (Silent G of course). Gnatalie put Prince Taylor under an awful spell, & that spell was Drunk-O-Vision (which as we know is BAD). Well Taylor & Meggie secretly wrote love letters back & forth, until one day.....


[canned gasps] Gnatalie discovered the letters Princess Meggie had been sending her hot, sexy husband. She said to herself ""I've got to put a stop to this!"" so she sent over her henchmen, Dumb & Dumber who had in their previous lives been beaten with ugly sticks to scare Meggie! [canned 'Oh no']. But, Meggie knowing Dumb & Dumber were coming, got her de-coy to stay in her Condo 6 Castle! So, okay, in the dead of night (2 am to be exact, 3:45 am if you're on Hanson time), Meggie road to Prince Taylor's Brooklyn Castle, broke in (because breaking & entering is SO much fun), gave Prince Taylor's son a little sleeping pill (yum yum) to keep him sleeping peacefully for he was soon to be Meggie's step-son. As Meggie approached Prince Taylor's bedroom she heard an ominous rumbling noise and realized the Witch was sleeping, Meggie opened the large wooden door to find the handsome Prince chained to a small cot. ""Oh no"" she thought to herself ""he's her love slave!"" Meggie walked over to Taylor's dinky cot and began breaking the chains with the powers of her awesome hot-ness. Prince Taylor awoke with a smile and whispered ""I've been waiting for you my love."" She smiled and said ""We must escape."" Taylor took Meggie in his arms as they walked out of the bed chamber. ""Where are you taking my husband?"" the Witch growled with her bad morning breath and bed-head. ""I'm taking my love away from this place"" Meggie said sticking out her Boobs of Death. The Witch got angry [grrrrrr] and said ""Over my dead body! You blonde"" With that Meggie boob slammed the With to the ground and tied her to the lamp-post at the corner of Broadway and 9th Ave with a sign around her neck saying ""Will work for food."" After the public humilation of the Witch, Princess Meggie, Prince Taylor and the Young Prince Ezra ran off to Meggie's private love island near Cancun, where Taylor and Meggie lived happily ever after and made many many many many many Hanson babies after that. The End</b>

Oh how I love that story!"

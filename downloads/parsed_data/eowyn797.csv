"event","I have been looking for a new place to live for the past week now. So far, nothing has felt right. I'm mostly looking up near Hollywood... north of the 10, west of the 5... I want a good clean house of friends to live with. Hardwood floors and lots of light. Walking distance to a CVS. I don't know...

I have been on a spring cleaning sort of kick since the new year, and it makes me wish i had all my stuff that is in storage here to go through and get rid of. So far, I have divested myself of a lot of makeup and that feels good. There is still way more to go.

I've been watching tv so slowly lately, it's ridiculous. I'm caught up in a good book that I'm sure some of you have already read (<i>A Game of Thrones</i>). I'm barely in to it at all. I meant to take it with me when I went north to look for housing last week, but it got left behind in the rush to get out the door. When I'm done here, I'm going to go read some more.

I've been going to old-lady-Wednesdays with my aunt and her group of friends. They go to the movies, see a 2 o'clockish matinee, and then have Friday's for dinner. So far this year, we've watched <b>The King's Speech</b>, which I loved, and <b>Black Swan</b>, which was really damn disturbing. It has grown on me, since. Natalie Portman probably deserves an Oscar. I skipped today's. Girly crap. They saw <b>The Fighter</b> and my aunt said she would have rather skipped it.

New Year's Eve was quiet-ish. Went to a club in Costa Mesa, met up with a few friends, watched one of them spin, rang in the new year with a sip of champagne that wasn't awful and then went home around 1. I like this productive feeling I've has since then and I hope it continues into the year. I'm very unfocused right now. What to do next is all cloudy in front of me, but I'm hoping things start falling in to place once I have secured a place to live. Until then, it's hard being far away down here in SJC, an hour+ from anything I'd want to do. I have been ungrounded and out of work for so long. My days are lacking in structure.

<lj-cut text=""I had a dream that I died last night."">I had a dream that I died last night.

There was this long protracted party scene. I'm pretty sure we were in Vegas. This beautiful 70's looking hepcat black lady was hosting the part and she was in an antique high-backed bathtub with bubbles almost the whole time. Charisma Carpenter was there. Something significant happened there, but I can't remember it now. I felt awkward and at some point, i was in water. When it was time to leave, Charisma and I got in the car. She wasn't really her, but she looked like her. She was supposed to be someone else, but I can't remember who, now.

We were driving down the freeway, heading east. I was on the phone with... a guy... it could have been Kermit, but somehow that doesn't feel right. We were talking about flights and planes... someone had to catch a plane that was delayed... It went on for a while. I remember turning back from the passenger's seat to look off behind me and I saw this plane coming down, so low, it was almost touching the power lines/telephone wires. I remember saying, into the phone, ""Wow, that plane is *really* low."" pausing and then knowing, with certainty that this plane was going to impact with the freeway at any moment now and it was so close to us, we were going to be caught in the fire. ""I love you"" i said, to the person on the line, then i hung up and faced forward and felt the crash behind us. 

I took some deep slow breaths, thiinking about snow and ice and polar bears and arctic seas. I slowed time and built a bubble around us, there in the car. it was blue and clear like a marble. I remember thinking that if i could keep it slow enough and cold enough in here, we might just reach the threshold and break away, but the explosion was too big. It was coming too fast. I felt the bubble slowly melt and so much orange and red fold in around us. Felt the back of the car lift up off the ground. Felt the pressure wave against the back of my head. And then we woke up.

We were standing on a lawn... maybe a park, not-Charisma and I. There were three dogs at our feet, between us. All three were hers. She pointed down at the fluffiest looking one and said, ""That's ______"" and suddenly I knew he had been dead for a long time. Childhood dog of hers maybe? Her husband joined us on the grass. She didn't seem very phased by it all. I'm not sure if he was already dead before then or if he had been caught in the blast and joined us here, but it became pretty clear that that's what we were... dead.. in holding... limbo? Whatever people call it.

I started walking forward, down the grassy strip. There was a sidewalk running through it. People walked by. There were joggers and dogs and people everywhere, like a Sunday in the park. I remember thinking, ""no. i wasn't done."" and then i started crying, waves that kept getting stronger. Not-Charisma and her husband caught up with me and tried to console me. I tried to explain that I wasn't sad that I was dead, but... something had been left unfinished and... I can't remember what it was, now, but it was important, personal and emotional. Maybe something to do with whoever the boy was on the phone. ""I love you.""

At some point, I ran into Canadian!David, although it was pretty clear to me that he wasn't dead. Some sort of projection, maybe? He looked at me funny and asked me what I was doing there. ""You don't belong here,"" he said, ""Come with me. I'm going to take you to see the lady."" I followed him to a house that was sunken down - you had to walk down stairs to enter the front door. Inside, things were small. There was furniture everwhere, but organised. And here, again, was the 70's black woman from the party, only she was out of the bathtub, dressed in flowing robe-like things, folds of fabric everywhere. Her face was sharp and angular, young, but also very old. She was with someone else. I waited my turn and then sat down with her.

She looked up at me, with these clear eyes. I couldn't tell you the color now, but they were very clear to me in the dream. ""You don't beleive in any of this, do you?"" she asked me. ""No. No, I don't. I don't know why I'm here."" I told her. We talked for a little while longer, maybe even without words. I only remember that she understood me and that she was the one who could make the decison to send me back, however I had gotten here. I remember the table in front of us and the sound of her voice, the movement of her earrings. In the end, she told David to take me and go (back). He took my arm and, as we turned to walk out the door, everything faded to white and I woke up. It was 8:30."

"event","I finally FINALLY just now watched the last episode of <b><i>Dollhouse</b></i> and OH MY HOLY MOTHER OF freaking why the crap did you have to be stupid stupid show YOU TOY WITH MY EMOTIONS first i hate you then i love you then you're retarded then you're awesome then you're lame then you're the show you always should have been and you totally have my HEART by the NUTS and THEN YOU'RE GONE. FOREVER.

stupid. 

stupid show. 

*brushes away tears*

anyway. let's move on to some new heartache. GOD. 

i haven't watched the most recent season of <b><i>FNL</b></i> yet...i'm saving it up so i can just mainline it and not have to wait. i'm weak like that. it better not make me crazy. is it gonna make me crazy, guys? no. i don't want to know. i can be patient. i need a show of serious serious serious quality in my life again. another B/A, another SFU, another Touching Evil, another ... Farscape. i should just start watching the second season of <b><i>Being Human</b></i> already and get it over with.

work has been less than stellar. as if humans don't need water to SURVIVE... and after all that trouble i went to to get a doctor's note... still can't have water at my register at work. *boggles* i've been slowly looking for other work, but... eh. it's few and far between out there. and, honestly, i work at a really really nice store (moronic upper management aside). also, i get paid a fair amount there... starting over somewhere else...eh. i don't feel like i can afford to work half again as hard for the same dough.

we have been going to more shows. driving down to LA at least 2 weekends a month, sometimes more, for saturday nights at Circus Disco. have seen some awesome DJs, heard some awesome music and danced some awesome dances. i also got a new spanking lovely camera for my birthday (that i have yet to learn how to use) from the family, so pictures of these events will likely be forthcoming... likely on Facebook because i've been lazy and they make it easy. also, i am addicted to Farmville. that's all there is to really say there :)

things happen, but i never write anymore. i just don't save up enough to say when i can turn to the person two feet to my left and share the minute something comes up. heh...

i am still reading, every day, though. i guess i need to step up and re-start contributing."

"event","had *such* an amazing weekend in Vegas seeing Markus Schulz and Above and Beyond and visiting Canadian!David... AMAZING!

Markus Schulz is... not my style... too hard-trance for me. But is he ever a nice guy! He actually stuck around an extra day and came to the A&B event the next night and danced in the crowd and gave a heartfelt little speech at the end about how great A&B were :) heh... nice dude.

Both shows were at The Palms in Vegas - Schulz was at Rain, first floor, which was kinda like a supermini massive. Good production values and these crazy lighting racks that moved...acrobats, dancers, fire, giant projection screens, etc... just like a big show, only in a smaller club. I'm guessing it holds like... 2K people? no idea, but it was fun. good layout. their sound system leaves something to be desired, though - kinda mushy. I hadn't bought tickets to this event because I wasn't really sure if i wanted to go and it was twice the cost of the A&B show the next night, plus...wasn't sure David would tolerate being dragged to TWO raves in one weekend, much less one... but then I got an e-mail in my box saying that I had won one of 25 pairs of free tickets to see the show and figured... hey, can't hurt to check it out if it's free! The biggest bonus was, once we finally found the right front-door chick with the right list, they let us right in, no waiting in the big line, no hassle, no nothin' - we were in in about 5 minutes. it was like VIP service, dude. ILU, Vegas :P

Above & Beyond was at Moon which is at the very top of The Palms (53rd floor). They have an outside balcony/patio area that faces the strip and you get this amazing panoramic view of it and Vegas/Henderson beyond. So freakin shiny... it looks pretty from far away :) But the truly awesome thing about Moon is that... inside, above the dancefloor...is this awesome curved roof... that opens up. That's right - they open the freakin' roof. I think this is, by far, the coolest indoor location i have ever attended a show at. The decor was awesome, the sound was great, the indoor/outdoor options were nice, the layout was easy - the bathrooms were easy to find and there weren't any huge lines (omg, this is key) - and it was small and intimate (500 people, man, only 500 PEOPLE!) and freaking AMAZING.

Above and Beyond completely rocked my socks off. It was like Armin, but with enough room to dance, less insane fans and everybody having the time of their freaking lives. Paavo kept holding up a laptop with short little notes to the crowd on it... ""this night is for you"".... I swear, they played *every* one of the songs that I put on the A&B favorites cd i had made for the drive out there. I sang along and danced like a loon. The energy was great, the people were friendly and even the bartender was nice. We didn't get yelled up by security or strip-searched at the door either, which was a change from past events. It was beautiful and transformative and funny and I think even David had a good time, despite it being the polar opposite of his scene :) 

I'd go back in a heartbeat. I'd drive 6 hours to see them anywhere.

David also took me along on a work call while we were there and i got to see the Zumanity theater at NYNY, backstage and all, while no one was there... it was really fun! We hung out, went to the M&M store, watched Star Trek, finally saw the Belagio gardens, watched the Mirage volcano go off and climbed a neverending hill in suburbia to see the sunrise on my last night there. Good times.

I'd do it again in a *heartbeat*. Any day."

i'm so behind on everything else... I did watch the Halloween ep of <b><i>Castle</b></i> and tee heeeee, cute. I started watching <b><i>FlashForward</b></i> and, seriously, does nothing sum up this crap better than the chief of whatever he is shouting ""IT WORKS FOR ME!"" over all the other character's rational objections to the gaping plotholes? YAY. i guess that's the stance they expect their viewers to take :) I hope that wasn't considered spoilery or anything, 'cause...too late now. I appologise. This is up to, like ep 7 or something now, right?

Altho at least 2 eps behind on all of this, I'm still in love with <b><i>Mad Men</b></i>. Still in love with <b><i>Glee</b></i>. Finally watched the pilot for <b><i>Caprica</b></i> and it was stupid. Still watching <b><i>Eastwick</b></i> altho I don't know why. No, lie, I do. It's called Paul Gross's smile. I have not watched <b><i>FNL</b></i> yet. I don't know if my eyeballs can take it! I may try my damndest to hold out all season and then mainline that puppy with a Costco box of kleenex at the ready. We shall see. My will may not be that strong.

Anyhow. Here we come, holidays. The day after Halloween and now the whole store looks like a Christmas tree. Whoopee. I'm wearing more halloween-y nail polish today in defiance or something. I had a dream with TONS of black widows in it the other night. Creepy. Conflict with the mother or heaps of good foturne coming to attack me in the near future?

Stuff and things in the hills tonight. Should be good times. Hopefully not frozen good times."

the laundromat was unusually hoppin' this evening. a woman wearing a track suit and abnormally loud clicking high heels asked me where the key for the bathroom was but didn't stick around to hear the answer. now everything is clean and smells like baked cotton. i started <i>Girlfriend in a Coma</i> tonight and, even though it's written in the first person, it doesn't annoy me in the slightest. I don't know why it's taken me 6 years to actually take this off the shelf. I tried to start that book my aunt left here, but it's that stupid tall book format and, 2 pages in, my wrist started to hurt. publishers are on crack. the writing may have also been a little bit attrocious.

All the interesting people are abandoning my work... so sad. No more Adam, Spencer or Unoriginal David :\ I am not amused! Work is incredibly dull lately...there's no one to have nonsense conversations with or anything.

There are so many options for moving, it's making me a little crazy. I was looking into Chicago for a while there and then it turns out that it's a dark frozen wasteland or some such thing 6 months out of the year and...eh, I'm still down. It's a long way to go, though, and cross-country moves are expensive. I'd love to go to San Francisco, but...yeah...jobs. Le suck. I need to figure out what to do next.

I am considering a year in South Korea teaching english. It seems to be the one job that my stupid degree will actually get me! Yay! and it would be exciting...new country, new language... I just don't know what other job to transition into. Lazy Acres is a unique thing, it seems. I need to travel and work with other people. A teaching degree here would just take forever. I'm pretty sure that TEFL courses are something i could take while i was there during breaks...eh, we shall see. I have only barely begun to look into it.

I've been feeling trapped by nothing to do for a while here. I want to dance like a crazy person and run around in the rain. I miss the scene, even. Ooooh. The rain seems to have stopped for now, but I'd still love a night of dancing and friends and talkign to strangers. I am starting to feel like myself again and the possiblities are endless."

I just kinda looked at her for a sec, but she was totally serious, so I said, "" Loops, that *is* the guy from The Fast & The Furious. He comes in here *all* the time.""

""Oh,"" she says, ""Really? ...I guess I gotta be nicer to him next time.""

I haven't bought a book in ages and there is, surpisingly, nothing pressing in my queue.

Also, if anyone has ever been to Japan...good places to go? We're thinking Tokyo for a week or so and then some other places within reasonable train distance.

We went to the Armin Van Buuren show at the Vanguard in Hollywood Saturday night. I don't remember the other two guys that were on before him - they just weren't my speed - but he was the last 3 hours of the night. The last three AMAZING hours of the night. And, now that I'm thinking back, we *have* been to the Vanguard before for a Bassrush event, but it was probably 4+ years ago and they've clearly remodled since then. It's really nice now. Their gigantosaurus steps up to the back patio are still weird and frekish and I don't know *why* you'd do that to drunk &amp; high people, but...that's LA. We deal. 

We did rent a hotel room for the night just because we needed a place to get ready, park the car for free (we *thought*. more on that later.), and because we had no idea how tired (or sober) we'd be at 4AM and the thought of driving home...needed to be an option, not a requirement. So we stayed at the Westide Rentals Hollywood Hotel. The hotel itself is fine. I'd totally stay there again...except...they completely and utterly screwed us over with regards to the parking situation. Kermit went in to check in and find out where to park while I waited in the car in the 5-min passenger whatever spot. They told him to ""park in the public lot around the corner on Cahuenga.""Right. THE public lot.

We had dinner at Sharky's. It's some fresh-mex chain in LA? I don't know. We read about it on TripAdvisor - the poster said it was the safest place in LA because it was where all the cops ate in Hollywood :) We looked, when we went in. No cops! I was disappointed :) On the other hand, their food was really good, some of it organic, all the meat was all natural, and the veggies were really fresh. We went back to the hotel to get ready and headed out around 8:30. We figured, for once, we'd get to an event early, get out tickets and be there from start to finish. Groovetickets is insane. Why on earth would you not open the will-call window until 9:30 when the event *begins* at 9:30? Especially when you have a line wrapping around half of LA that indicated that 95% of the people attending this event are in your will-call line? WTF, yo? I was glad we got there early and were only maybe 20-30 people back in line instead of 1000+. 

We did a lot of wandering around. We met some nice people (wut up, Mike with the wife, who was there celebrating his neighbor's gay son's 21st birthday! And wut up, little asian couple who were there celebrating their own 21st birthday! don't worry, Plur&nbsp;ain't goin' nowhere.). Lots of people loved our shirts. We killed a lot of time and i whined about being bored, but eventually it was midnight and the 2nd opening guy was kicking things into a gear i finally enjoyed, so we went inside and spent the rest of the night, moving slowly but surely up to the very front, where Armin signed the back of one of our tickets during a moment of downtime :) heh. That makes the 2nd celebrity to sign the back of something (thanks, Keanu.) at a concert. 

Allow me a moment to fangirl and squee&nbsp;at the highest volume possible because, Armin Van Buuren? Totally rules the school. Rocks my socks right off. And has THE single best freaking smile on the face of the planet, I swear to you.&nbsp;THE BEST! You cannot look at that face while he's jumping up and down and grinning like a loon and be unhappy, at all, ever. EVER! So we had three hours of amazing THAT, with great music and the kind of closeness and room to breathe that you never get at the bigger events. Totally ruled. Loved every minute of it. $6 bottles of water, but hey...that's how it goes. Worth every penny, to watch that show!

So when we got out of the concert, Kermit was still wide awake and I was thinking...damn, let's just go back to the hotel, shower and drive home tonight. Screw sleeping for 5 hours and *then* getting up to drive home. So we went to the parking lot to get the car...<lj-cut text=""which was no longer there.""> which was no longer there.

There are, apparently, *two* public lots right around the corner on Cahuenga. We parked in the wrong one. Now, we didn't go back and look for the one we should have parked in, due to the HIGHLY ridiculous amount of asshattery that occured later, but we definitely didn't see the sign for it...so, while we were at the event (probably standing around being reeeeeally bored by progressive), they towed my car. 

Man, walking up to where you parked and *not* finding you car is the freakiest feeling. Lordy. But I told myself, no, don't freak out, maybe it's been towed. We had left our cell phones in the room on the way to the lot and we had no pen/paper (which i always keep in the car!), so we tried our best to just remember the number while walking back to the hotel. It's about 4:30AM now. When we got back, we called them and the dude on the other end related his tale of woe.

The guy at the parking lot we *did* park in, called the hotel. Twice. The man who answered the phone told him that there were no guests staying in the hotel with cars AT ALL. This is the same man who, 5 hours earlier, had given us a damn parking permit and told us to park around the corner. HAD THIS MAN SAID YES, we would have been given an opportunity to move the car before it was towed. But he did not.&nbsp;I tried to explain tot he parking dude that, we were, in fact, guests at this hotel - sitting in the room, calling you from it, right now! - and that that we did, in fact, have a car.&nbsp;He told us there was nothing he could do, he called the hotel and we should speak to them.&nbsp;Speak to the hotel? The hotel is effin' asleep, dude. it's 4:30am. Kermit did try knocking on the manager's door a few times and calling the after-hours number that was posted, but, predictably, they did not answer and the number went straight to voicemail. What's the good of having an after-hours number that no one answers?&nbsp;I do not know.

So we called the towing company. They have my car. They don't care if it was an error, and besides that, it's the early ass crack of dawn on Easter Sunday. If there were a dispute to be had, it'd have to wait until Monday anyway, at which point we'd owe them twice as much money, have to pay for another night at the hotel and miss work. We called both the parking place and the towing company back at least two more times to ask more questions and explain the situation, but, truly, they did not care. So, at 6:30am, still unslept, unshowered and car-less, we called a taxi company to take us the friggin 6 miles that they had towed the car (this is ridiculously far, in LA), argued with the towing company over using our debit cards as credit cards (because they are clueless and cannot work their own machinery) &amp;&nbsp;paid them far too much money.

Then the guy told us to go to the gate outside, he'd open it up and we could get our car out. So we stood there and waited like good little children. And in the 7 hours since they'd towed it, they'd towed 2 other cars that were now in front of it, so they had to get their tow trucks and move each of those cars out of the way...blah blah dee freakin dah... Kermit pointed out that, at least we get to see the sunrise. I told him that sunrise could shove it and that LA was dead to me now. We had a conversation a long time ago about how the only proper way to see a sunrise is when you're still up from the night before. If you have to get up early to see it, you're doing it wrong. This fiasco is another wrong way, i wager. Sunrises should inspire awe, not grumbling and the disowning of cities. Finally, at like, 7am...we got in the car and left. Kermit was, miraculously, still awake enough to drive us all the way back home and gracious enough to let me sleep for an hour and a half. I think he's becoming the pilot again. wee :)

While looking online for the location of this towing company, I had run across MULTIPLE accounts of people being maliciously overcharged by them. Apparently, in LA county, a towing company is only allowed to charge what the LAPD would charge if they had towed your car. That going rate, right now, is $107. I think they're also allowed to add one day's storage fees onto that, so $130-140 should be the max you're charged. They made us pay $250. The retarded thing is, the freaking towing company has this info posted RIGHT THERE ON THE DAMN WALL outside the window where you pay, and yet they still wrote down $170 for the towing fee plus the extra storage fee and an after-hours fee, that i can only assume applied because it was the weekend and a holiday or something. I'm not sure if they're allowed to do that...either way...grossly overcharged by a minimum of $50. Every account that I ran across&nbsp;said they had taken the company to small claims court and won, so we're looking into that now, with the help my my amazing dad who understands all this stuff much better than I do.

In a way, thank god we didn't know because we would have had to leave the event and we would have missed an incredible good time. In another way,&nbsp;I am now out $250 goddamn dollars to a completely crooked towing company because of the stupid hotel's mistake. And my green jacket, which I lost at the event...I am also blaming on them, just for good measure :) Stupid hotel.</lj-cut>

So now I get to start the search for another lime green jacket (I gave it to Kermit to drape over his little messenger bag type thing...turns out we should have tied it on there, what with all the people pushing past and dancing like wild monkeys) and my first civil suit. Go, America!"

"event","so we saw <b>The Fall</b> and Kermit got his back scratched by a 98 (or was it 96?) year-old lady. she told him he was a good boy and scratched his back for a good couple of minutes. said it keeps her young, which was both cute and creepy. The Fall was, of course, LOVELY. i had no problems with it at all. gorgeous gorgeous color everywhere and pretty pretty Lee Pace eyelashes OMG.

we also saw <b>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</b> in the really old Arlington theater with the stars on the ceiling and some fresh outta prison idiot wouldn't shut the hell up and almost got into a fight with another dude. i forgot that crazy people go to that theater. it was good tho - i liked it (the movie, not the idiots)!

Kermit is still in search of work in the Bay Area (preferably somewhere on the peninsula or in the city)...we eventually want to move up there. i'm just sick of 80 degree heat and it has become the norm down here, altho not for the last three days! it has been just gloriously overcast or breezy and cool. i should have ridden my bike yesterday. if it still works. it's been sitting in the downstairs garage for a year+ now, unridden. if the clouds burn off later today maybe i'll go for a ride.

also, i hate Lucky magazine (to which i have a weird 5-yr subscription). i can afford exactly nothing they advertise in there. it's all ""THE BEST SUMMER CLOTHES FOR UNDER $100"" and then it's like...each piece of the outfit costs $98. guys, c'mon. 

work has been...weird. Alberto and i got into some sort of lover's tiff about the ONE DAY A WEEK he has been scheduling me in the deli and now, apparently, i'm not going to be scheduled there at all anymore. this is FINE with me - it's actually what i wanted/needed for my wrist, but....without communication and without talking to Miguel (Cap Bar manager) so he can put me on *his* schedule more to make up for it? so childish. so i'm only working 2 days this week instead of 3 or 4 because the man can't get it together to have a real conversation with anyone and treat his employees professionally. whatever. my wrist has been getting better, slowly but surely, but really only because i've only been working that one day a week in the deli. it gets better to the point where it's not causing problems for me at all and then i have my one day there and it's painful all over again. lather, rinse, repeat every week. this is why i'm glad to, apparently, not be working in the deli anymore, since the hand therapists were all telling me to get out get out. but still, y'know? are there professional managers, like...anywhere? this is a worker's comp issue, man, i'm not just some disobediant child trying to make their lives harder. i realise it sounds stupid to say that pushing buttons on a scale is causing me serious pain, especially when it doesn't seem to be happening to anyone else there (except it totally IS because Rox has issues with her hands WAY worse than mine only she's too afraid of being fired (even tho she wouldn't be) and too self-depreciating to say anything).

anyhow. enough of that drama.

i want to start packing. i've been in this apartment longer than i've lived anywhere else in my life and it feels like time to go."

"event","so we saw <b>Speed Racer</b> today. damn, i liked that a lot more than i thought i would and it was *nothing* like i was expecting (i hadn't seen previews first or anything tho) frickin' *everybody* was in that! i liked it, i sure did :)

we also saw the next <b>Narnia</b> this weekend, which i also liked, despite whatshisface. yay swords! yay horses!

had lunch with my brother who reccomended us some crazy Russian film called <b>Stalker</b>. anyone seen that? apparently it's visually amazing and 3 hours long.

but what i really can't wait for is <b>Wall-E</b>. can. not. WAIT. seriously, watch the trailer. i nearly exploded with cute. i almost cried with cute :) i think that comes out June 27th? 26th? whatever, i'm THERE.

Kermit made his patented spaghetti the other night - i missed that so much - he used to make it all the time when he lived down in Pasadena. we practically lived on the stuff. SO good. he's the king of perfect sauce, imo. he's also learning French. did i mention that last time? maybe not...anyway, he's learning French :) it's kind of awesome!

i'm mostly over in the Cap Bar at Lazy Acres again, but still scheduled at least one day a week in the deli and going to therapy for my hand. it gets better all week and then i work a day in the deli and it's bad again - i see a solution here, yo. unfortunately, the Cap bar doesn't have enough hours to give me right now, so i have to stay in the deli at least one day, sometimes two. Maria's pregnant and going on maternal leave the first week of June, tho, so maybe it'll work out better after that. the big downside to all of it is that they are apparently going to make us wear hats in teh Cap Bar now, the BANE of my existence over in the deli. seriously. i cannot hack the hat. it obstructs my vision, constantly gets knocked off, ruins my hair (and believe me, i'm not normally one who cares about her hair, but when it's broken and frizzy all the time....well...) and OMG makes me feel SO unattractive, i can't even describe. i'm sure that sounds petty, but it's sort of amazing the effect that something small can have when you ahve to do it for 8 hours a day. anyway. 

i also want to move. Kermit needs a new job, eventually and the job market here is more than pathetic. we're thinking north - Bay Area or something... i have no idea when that will happen, as it's contingent upon him finding work up there first, but i'm just totally done with being here. this place enchants me no longer! everyone else loves it but i never really have and now the weather has gotten wacky and it's much hotter in the summer than it used to be and it's just not my cup of tea. i've lived here, both in SB and in this apartment, for longer than i've lived anywhere else in my life...i need to move, if only to clear out all the crap we've accumulated in the interim :)

speaking of crap - if anyone is into nail polish and wants to pay for shipping, just let me know what colors you like and i'll gladly send you a box. i have WAY too much and it needs a new home."

"event","so i had a birthday and Kermit got me <a href=""http://www.iloveblocks.com/wishlist.html"">this awesome emerald necklace</a>! i <3 it so! my parents gave me a weekend at some hotel neat Hearst's Castle with a tour or something, which is awesome as i've never been there before despite living only an hour and a half away...

my parents were just in town for the week (they've been living in Michigan for almost a year now, i guess) - they were already planning to be here on Thursday and Friday, but then my fake grandma (step-mother's mom) had a stroke and they came out early to see her. she seems to be doing fine and is sloooowly gaining back the use of her voice, legs, etc. she's a strong woman and i'm not worried about her - she's a total trooper. even my step-mom, who is known to be a worry-wart, seemed less worried than i expected, so that's a good sign. it was great to see them again...i spent a whole day hanging out with my dad, running errands and eating, just like old times. we even talked politics and oil. it was crazy!

i'm back working in the Cappucino Bar at work 3 days a week (still in the deli for 1). i'm still going to the worker's comp doc every two weeks for my wrist, but taking me out of the deli has seemed to make things a WORLD of better. the Cap Bar's current manager is leaving...actually, today was her last day, and all the various management upstairs people have been attacking me over the past two weeks to take over her duties, but the schedule is ass and it would basicly ruin any chance Kermit and i have of getting out lives back or spending any real time together (as it would require that i work one weekend day *every* week AND be there every Monday, so no Sa/Su w/Kerm and no Su/Mo, which was our perfect schedule of yore), so...forget that shiznit! it doesn't even pay that much better, so i'm content where i am for now. it's an honor just to be nominated, y'know...

i've been so absent here - it seems like nothing much goes on in my life. Kermit & I finished watching <b><i>Six Feet Under</b></i> a while back and i just really deeply and profoundly LOVE that show. it's like this perfect self-contained gem of awesome and i want to share it with as many people as possible. every single time i watch it, no matter wher ei am, it mirrors what's going on in my life in some way - every time through it's different characters i connect with or sittuations that i see reflected in my own life. i'll stop babbling now, but i love it so, it's nuts :)

i started him on season 1 of <b><i>Battlestar Galactica</b></i>, and he's loving that. it's nice watching it over, too - what a genius show. we're on season 2 now, i think...we haven't had time to watch this week with the parents coming early. we've been re-watching <b><i>The West Wing</b></i> (well, it's new to him) and we're mid 5th season. sometimes i have to remind myself that he's not really the president and that things are much more insane and stupid out in the real world, but for 45 minutes most mornings i get to live in my little fantasy world :)

we've watched <b>Stop-Loss</b>, <b>The Bank Job</b> and <b>Run Fatboy Run</b> recently...they went from crap to great, in that order.

i went through and cleaned out these 2391409184 tubes of movie posters that i've been hanging onto since college. most of the stuff was CRAp-ola, but there was some good stuff, i thought that people on here might enjoy. i divided them up into 4 tubes. i'll ship them media mail so they're cheap and if you can chip in the $2-3 for shipping, that'd be beyond awesome since i'm...well, you know how it is after the holidays sometimes. if not, don't worry! i'll send you anything you want totally free too!

i'm doing the same thing with all of my movie/tv magazines that i've been collecting since, like...1997. i have nearly 100 of them, you know my interests, so if there's an actor/movie/show you're looking for, just ask and i can tell you if i have anything from them. i'll work on actually listing them out, but...bah, there are a lot. i have lots of Buffy/Angel/Actors from those shows stuff and tons of Ewan/Moulin Rouge/Nicole Kidman, LotR/Actors, Superheroes/whatever, TONS of UK magazines for all of that stuff i just listed...you know me. i'm a fan slut. ask after anything you might be interested in...i'm in the giving & house clearing mood! these are a lot heavier, so seriously...even $2 towards shipping would be lovely, but again, if not THAT'S OKAY TOO. i mainly want the stuff to go to good homes because the thought ofjust throwing it all away saddens me.

feel free to refer other people to my post here if you think they'll be interested too...it's not limited just to the flist. if you know someone who might like the stuff, send 'em over! or let me know where to find them!

<lj-cut text=""lists of all the STUFF"">here are the 4 tubes of posters i have to give away:

"event","so we went and saw <b>Juno</b> last night. fuzzy. i lked it.

we're going down to LA for Christmas morning with Kermit's parents and then probably coming back here in the afternoon. i have no idea what traffic is like and whether that's folly or not. whatever, it's what we're doing :)

i feel like i've been living in a little bubble lately. i got presents for two people this year and one of them isn't even going to get here until after christmas (through no fault of my own). the other one is for someone who isn't even here so i can't give it to them until after Christmas anyway. it's a weird year. my family is all spread out, with my brother, Kermit and i here and everyone else back in Michigan right now. it would have been really great to go back there and have a Christmas in the snow like old times...i mean really really great, but there was no way to get the time off work.

we have <a href=""http://www.livinginthewalls.com/images/personal/ourlittlefaketree.jpg"">our little fake tree</a> up! it looks better irl than in pictures, though. 

thank you to everyone who sent us cards! you can see some of them in the tree, there...we took that picture last week tho so there are a few more in there now. i'm so bad at sending out cards...one of these years, inspiration will strike me and i'll actually write in them and send them out instead of just buying a box like i do every year and letting it sit there.

i have a bunch of tidying up to do today...speaking of which...when plain bleach and water are not getting your clothes whiter, any suggestions? i let my work shirts soak in bleach water in the tub for 12 straight hours yesterday and NADA. i guess they look a shade less grey now, but...only if you're looking really hard.

i feel like i should be baking or rushing out to buy last minute things or feeling like it's actually Christmas tomorrow...i hope you are all having a great Christmas Eve with family and friends everywhere :) i wish you shiny bright fuzziness and warm fluffy good will."

OMG 25 minutes sucks.). and then they won't let you flush and they turn off the water to the faucets in the bathroom and there are no paper towels or trashcans and it was a freaking disaster. whatever. the damn chick i had to hand it to had latex gloves on. why couldn't she have given me a pair of those puppies! way to overshare there, i know.

ANYWAY, i have the job at Lazy Acres pending the results of my drug test and background check. welcome to corporate america and the Albertson's subsidiary that is Bristol Farms (who now own Lazy Acres)!

i have work to finish up with Crossmark this week, but somehow all my Carpinteria work got unassigned...whatever. gift horse. mouth. not looking. still no e-mail reply back from my manager after i wrote her last Thursday with my resignation so that's almost worse than her just being outright upset with me in any way. fun! anywhoo, i've got some work to do today, still, but it's at the Vons 3 blocks down the street, woo! walking to work!

i'm up to episode 3x07 in <b><i>BSG</b></i>...still love that show. i've been watching <b><i>Damages</b></i> too. now who told me to watch this? it's freaking awesome. i love Glenn Close, hot damn, she can act the socks off of anyone else, at anytime, anywhere.

Kermit & I saw <b>Stardust</b> yesterday and i REALLY liked it, which was a welcome change after loathing the book. it was really really good and i recommend anyone who is on the fence about it get out there and see it :) last weekend, we watched...er...what was it? frell. OH YEAH, the <b>Bourne Ultimatum</b>! i also dug that. heaps better than the second movie and really great connections to the first movie. i'm not such a fan of the shakey-cam that seems to have taken over action flicks these days, tho. i'd rather be able to see the action rather than feeling like i'm in the fight with them, y'know? i'm sure he was doing awesome stuff, but frankly, you couldn't see much of it very well. same deal with <b>Transformers</b>, altho i sort of understand that one because the bluriness probably reduced their FX budget by a good deal. anyway, that's just my two cents and could be because i'm blind :)

speaking of...link me to the <b>Stardust</b> icons/caps (not from the trailer, pls), pronto! i have a need :) grazie!"

i had a working review thingymajigger with my manager on Monday (i had no idea it was a review at the time) which supposedly went well. she wants to give me more responsibilities. my stupid ass said ""that's fine!"" when all i really wanted to do was quit on the spot. i'm hoping Lazy Acres comes through for me soon so i can...i went up there to talk to my old manager again yesterday, but he was swamped so i left my phone number, stressed how flexible i could be and hope he calls me back today or tomorrow.

my current job is so disorganised, it's nuts. they routinely don't send me the materials i need to complete projects, can't spell my name right for the life of them (EITHER of the ways i've provided), give me out of date information to work with...it's just not working. i mean, really, if their clients could see the way their money is being mishandled...*cries*

i finally wore makeup for the first time in 47 days yesterday. it feels weird to talk about that here because it sounds so damn superficial and lame, but i've been *really* into it for the past year or so and then i stopped altogether when it got super hot and just never picked it up again. it's only weird because of the sheer ridiculousness of the amount of makeup i own. anywhoo, i did this weird teal/cream thing  that rocked with this crazy mascara that i'll never wear again because it looked terrible by the end of the day. whatever. i'm going to shut up about that now :) i think my brain just needs an outlet after all the farking staLinJ crap."

also, a while back, Kermit received this in a swap i had with a girl from...West Virginia, i think:
http://pics.livejournal.com/kermix/pic/0011tp3w 
made of terrible and awesome hilarity. we've received some rather odd candy over the year, but that one takes the cake. to his credit, he tried it, ""ketchup"" and all!

we had visitors this weekend! yay! it was also Fiesta in our neck of the woods so we had some kickass corn & ribs on Saturday down in the De La Guerra park. it was really good, actually.

everything's on fire up here and it's sort of scary. they had the <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-zacafire4aug04,1,1254771.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-california""><b>Zaca fire</a></b> down to 30% containment a week ago, and now it's 70% again but moving swiftly toward us. it's nuts. it's burned 67,675 acres so far and they're not expecting full containment until September 7th. they're hoping the mountain range keeps it from spreading into Santa Barbara proper, but they closed down the 154 and 246 all the same. there's ash everywhere and these looming brown clouds over the hills. at least Schwarzenegger has finally declared it an emergency zone or wahtever, so they'll be sending state aide in the way of...whatever water, firefighters, idk...it's le crazy.

i'm still upset and it's got nothing to do with pr0n and everything to do with unethical & illegal business practices, but i'm slowly figuring out how to syndicate things and get around stuff and re-structure and move without really moving. i made a syndicated feed of my journal over at InsaneJournal <lj user=""eofeed""> but right now there's nothing there (except this entry, if i've figured out how to make Semagic multi-post) and won't be until the end of October."

anyway. i don't care if that sounded haughty. it doesn't make it any less true.

i'm burnt out on hot weather and it's blissfully cool today, so that's nice. i saw <b>Sunshine</b> with Kermit & my brother over the weekend and really liked 3/4 of it. a lot. i mean a-lot-a lot. now i feel guilty when i complain about how bright it is outside and wish for snow and for it to be night all the time. thank you, Danny Boyle. no, really, it was beautiful and i really did like those 3/4 of it a whole freaking lot.

i have a new harddrive to replace the dying one. it's been sitting on the floor since last, what...Thursday? still in the box. i'm lame :) i think my older DVD drive is going now too as it doesn't seem to want to read half the DVDs i burn with the second drive. go figure. at least those are cheap :)

WOW, i was lame back then. i mean, WOW. i'm so glad i never sent this letter. my handwrtiing looked exactly the same then as it does now, which is oddly comforting. his name was Aaron Ganz and he lived half a block away from me and sat in front of my in 5th period Geometry. he lent me his notes for the whole year when i came in halfway because of Germany. instead of ""big hands, i know you're the one,"" i used to mis-sing the lyrics to ""Blister in the Sun"" as ""hey, Ganz, i know you're the one!"" *cracks up*

finally met up with my old manager on Wednesday, so now i'm waiting for a call back from the head of the department. now that they're owned by a diffferent company, there's all this procedure and chain-of-command stuff to go through. we'll see :) i'm already mostly trained and have a raport with the staff. i'm hoping it's a no-brainer for them to hire me back.

Kermit's awesome and ordered me a new harddrive, since one of the partitions on one of the two big drives i have failed, which usually means the other half its not far behind. i haven't taken it out of the box or done anything with it yet because it's addressed to him and he never gets packages :) i'll stick it in this weekend and give my computer its first reboot in at least a two weeks. yay, space!

i have now finished watching the miniseries & first season of <b><i>BSG</b></i>, and i like it so much :) Raul went nuts over it, but usually, when he goes nuts over something, it's a sure sign that i'll hate it, so i held off for a really long time. i forget who was the most recent person to mention how awesome it was, but i finally gave in. so. good."

we spent a lot of time sitting around reading on the pier or the couch. Kermit finally got through ""Quicksilver"" and i'm almost done with that damn Renshai book i started 2 years ago. it's just so badly written...and long...fleh. at least there were some hilarious sex scenes :) i did a LOT less reading than normal tho...we were in town a lot with the Cherry Festival going on and we had a rousing night of Flux as well. Kermit got into a kayak for the first time ever and enjoyed the crap out of it :) we had smores one night and saw <b>Die Hard</b> and <b>Transformers</b>! weeeeeee!

i'm so in love with <b>Transformers</b>, it's ridiculous. i wanted to cut out all the stupid human subplots like the chick's past and the stupid s7 guy, but OMGOPTIMUSPRIME. before Ron Livingston became my media husband, there was Optimus Prime. our love was about truth and honor and the protection of mankind. *wibbles* that movie was so. freaking. cool.

now we're back and have been for about a week. i ate a freaking Happy Meal for the first time since i was 10 because they have Hello Kitty toys in them now and OMGwant. so now i have a toy. and i'll never eat there again because wow, chicken nuggets are terrible now that they're all white meat. also, i think we got irradiated in there. this must be why they have a 30min time limit posted on the wall.

i've been doing my work, trying to meet up with my old boss from Lazy Acres and repeatedly missing him. i want my old job back so i can quit this one i'm at. it's just not working for me and that's not something that's going to change, sadly enough. besides, the fsckers still can't spell my damn name right despite my calling and asking them for a new name tag and to change the info in their files FOUR TIMES, so that's it. they're not worth my time anymore. i stopped by Lazy Acres last night to get water and see if yon manager was there (alas) and ran into old co-workers and fleh i just miss having friends so much. it's time for teamwork again - all this lone wolf shite i've been doing for the past 2 years has sucked. the end!

i got little drawers and organized my desk and got rid of a bunch of crap that was lying around the house. there's still more to do so i'll try to take care of most of that today. once the floors are cleared off, i can sweep and make this place livable again :)

"event","went to my first ever family reunion for my father's side of the family this past weekend up in San Mateo...it was weird. i have a cousin who i haven't seen since he was less than a year old who's now 14, which means i haven't seen his mom in just as long. she and i were bestest friends when i was little. she's the closest aunt to me in age. she doesn't look the slightest bit different now, which is sort of scary :) 

i forgot how annoying my cousin Jael is or how much i <3 the black half of my family. crackups, i tell ya. my cousin Bluto is back to being a fireman after a year as a medic in Oakland - his comment was this: ""oh yeah, the mortality rate's actually gone *down* since i quit being a medic in Oakland. they're doin' alright now."" heh. it's so weird how my little cousins all have kids now. so so weird. i guess that's because the last time i saw them, most of them were still under the age of 18 and now they're not...

we dragged my brother up there with us and he got food poisoning or something on the first day and was out to lunch until the day we had to leave. le suck. at least he had a good sound system to listen to relax-y music on. my uncle Benny's...er...media room...is insane. he has a projector, surround sound and a wall screen. we watched <b>Superman Returns</b> for the third time OMG. le melt. i can never go back to monitors and tvs! i want my own home theater.

things have been largely uneventful. i have written my manager 3 times asking her for more work (i'm supposed to take over every store we cover in the whole city) and she's written back with either an unintelligble reply that had nothing to do with what i wrote her about or not responded at all. i'm so confused. this company is the most scatterbrained corporation i have ever worked for. a real example of that whole ""right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing"" thing. i like the work, i'd just love to be assigned more than 4 hrs/wk of it, damnit. i want to be assigned a full work load so i can see whether i have enough time left in my work week to possibly ask for my old Lazy Acres job back a couple times a week. i miss being on my feet and moving all day, but most of all i miss customer service. i miss interacting with hundreds of people a day and working with a team.

at the end of the month, provided i get any sleep between now and then, we are going to the Electric Daisy Carnivale in LA. that should be sweet :) it'll be a good excuse to see Raul & Shelly and get out of the house - mingle and be social. god, i miss...people.

i can't wait for <b>Day Watch</b> to come out...COME OUT ALREADY. that and <b>Sunshine</b>. and <b>Transformers</b>, <b>Die Hard</b> and <b>Ratatouille</b>.

oh, i also started doing yoga which has been good. it keeps me stretching, if nothing else. i'm no good at these solitary endeavours. i keep wanting someone in the the same shape i'm in to do it with me. i've been doing it about 4 times a week tho, which is pretty good."

"event","had an good long weekend...honored the memory of those who died to protect our economy by buying things, namely makeup for me and shoes for Kermit. we didn't actually spend that much money. we're bad Americans.

<lj user=""haplo184"">, <lj user=""kermix""> & i all went to Golf N' Stuff on Saturday, half as a goodbye to Dallas and half becuase we had been planning to for ages. <lj user=""xantus""> was suspiciously absent, but we made do. and now Dallas is probably halfway to Nevada enroute to Traverse City, Michigan, where we will meet back up with him and the rest of the family mid-July.

the parents are...somewhere in Colorado, i'm betting, also enroute to Michigan. it's so weird to think they may never move back to California again. it must be so hard fro them to be completely uprooted out of their lives like this, unwillingly at that. i hope their trip is going well and that an entire summer at the cabin up north turns out to be just the mulching process they need. people never stop being just as petty as the are in high school, which is also odd and kind of sad. karma. it's funny how predictable things are sometimes, both reassuring and stupifying.

my grandmother on my dad's side turns...like...1,000,000 or something soon and we're all going up to San Francisco (well, San Mateo) to party mid-June. it's going to be a joint birthday-family reunion thing, which will be super weird. i have an uncle and a cousin i have never in my life met before who will be there. i also have another cousin who i haven't seen since he was 1. he is now, like...14. that means i also haven't seen his mother in that long...she used to be my favorite aunt :) anyway, it should be really nice to see everyone again. i got an e-mail from my step-mother informing me that one of my aunts has gotten fat, and that said aunt has requested that we all pretend not to notice. family is so weird :) i told her i'd keep quite about her if she kept quiet about mine.

speaking of which, YOGA. <b><font size=""+1"">recommend me your favorite Yoga, Pilates, etc...DVDs</b></font>. i'm planning to do an hour of it every morning for the next month to help with the aforementioned weight issue. i'd prefer a woman instructor, preferably not blonde, but if she is, i'll deal. they always look like my mother when they're blonde. any help will be much appreciated :)

hope you all had a nice 3-day weekend, if you had the time off."

"event","go, training. i had my first day of real hands-on working with someone who knew what they were doing. i feel much more confident, which is nice. i know what to do and generally who to talk to, so i'll eventually be good to go. next week i get trained like that again on the other half of my job and then i'll be set, methinks.

things have been different, lately. for one thing, it was freaking 90 degrees the other day and that sucked. i guess that's not really so different...i still loathe hot weather. it still makes me irrationally violent :) we still need to live in a house with an air conditioner or at least a better system of fans/venting.

somehow i managed to chip the opal in my ring. i guess my lifestyle is too wild and crazy for soft stones, yo. now that i've had my 12yr old fantasy come true, it's time for something a little more official, stable and durable, i suppose.

holy crap. someone on my block is listening to <b>The Bodyguard</b> soundtrack <i>REALLY</i> loud. nice.

also, saw and liked <b>Hot Fuzz</b> :) woo Simon Pegg! when did he get hot, man? i totally missed the memo. that was a hilarious and awesome movie.

i've been rewatching <i><b>Six Feet Under</b></i>, slowly but surely, with <lj user=""kermix""> and we're mid season 2 right now. i love this show in a profound sort of way. i know it sounds stupid to say this about a television show, but it feels vitally important to my life. i tried, but can't explain why without sounding high or stupid, so i'll just assume that those of you who would understand already do.

i've been so remiss in writing and commenting here. i've been spending my time over at MUA, chattin' up folks about makeup. i'm clearly insane, but at least i'm less poor now. i've lost something...maybe they're right and you really do have to be miserable and alone to write well. i'm out of the loop, i only hear the news through morning radio and the internet. my in-person face time with the world has tumbled downhill. this job, sure, will put me out there, but out there in a bubble of sorts. i'm just checking numbers, really, not interacting. we'll see :) at least it'll be flexible which should leave me time for other things.

it seems like i should say something else..."

we have spent most of this week moving out and then back into our apartment because of this crazy heat treatment process the landlords had done for termites. they tented the place and heated it up to 150F, so we had to move out anything that would be damaged by that...it ended up be 3/4ths of our whole house :) YAY. we're still not totally unpacked...and for some reason, our oven doesn't turn on. the pilot light is lit, but it won't actually light the  burner above the broiler or anything. *blinks* all the burners up top work fine!

i brouht home a bunch of Bath & Body Works Twisted Peppermint 3-in-1s that i had the brother pick up for me a while back, so YAY FOR PEPPERMINT! he also got me some awesome lip gloss stuff that smells like Hot Chocolate so freaking HELLZ YEAH to that. i have the best brother.

and that's it!

it sucks to grow up in my family :) i whined to my dad about it the day after christmas because i am SO COOL like that. so he bought me a bag of pre-shelled pistachios. halfway through the bag, i realised that they come in shells to slow you down because eating half a bag of pure nuts in the space of 10 minutes is not GOOD for you and if you have to spend all that time unshelling them yourself you can only eat them half as fast.  presents AND education! WIN!

it was good to see my little brother who is supposedly moving back to out neck of the woods next year. kudos. we debated as to whether i should go to work at a coffee shop downtown because of the mix cd they were playing, but all of a sudden the next song came on a sucked so we scrapped that idea. plus, i am tres familiar with that place and it is tiny and crazy and i might go mad working there with no space. still on the hunt tho. maybe i'll apply at MACY'S. if only their employees didn't look so completely depressed to be there.

we have zero plans for New Year's and i'm trying really hard to like it that way. we'll see. i think we'll see <b>The Good Shepard</b>, if i have anything to say about it. my brother and i made the mistake of seeing <b>Happy Feet</b> while he was down here WITHOUT taking drugs first. bad bad bad bad bad idea. the people who wrote it were clearly strung out on 10 years of Disney flicks on repeat and 30 pounds of crack. do NOT see that movie without some sort of mind altering preparation, man. <i>so. freaking. weird.</i>

we went to San Diego this past weekend for Kermit's family Chrmistmas thing. i made my famous screwball cake and everyone seemed to like it. i always feel weird not bringing anything, so it was cookies last year and cake this year. at least that way i guarntee there will be one declicious thing for me to eat :) luckily this year it was all good food, even tho it was Mexcian which i don't usually like...it was whitebread mexican, if such a thing exists ;) the only problem is - now we stil have half a cake and i'm totally gonna eat it.

his family is always so nice to me...his aunt gave me (well, she gave us all the same thing, really) this really tacky sparkely christmas ornament of a bear in a heart and she's all ""get it?! because it's all about LOVE!"" :) she gave kermit a frog because...how could you not, right? :P we stayed with his cousins and played Guitar Hero on their giant wall-sized movie screen projector crazy omg setup. pretty amusing. they also have 6 cats and two birds in that house which was the nuts kind of fun :)

we made te rounds to come local outlet malls, including Las Americas, which was kind of creepy because it's right on the border and one side of the parking lot is...the freaking WALL between the US and Mexico. it's really very disturbing. we parked by wall section 245. why on earth is there a wall? i can't remember any other border crossing ive been at in the rest of the world that has a wall...i mean i KNOW why it's there. it just shouldn't be. anyway.

bought more makeup no one needs but now i have new pretty colors to play with. and we got Kermit some jeans...which i have been trying to get him to wear again SINCE WE MET. he was always too busy towing the ""there's no room for my enormous boy parts!"" line or whatever until i talked him into trying on jeans in Camarillo last month and now he's learning the error of his ways :)

also, we are idiots and hit up the Fashion Valley mall on Saturday night and spent 20 mintutes looking for parking only to be rained on when we got out of dinner. genius :) i did get to go to the freestanding MAC there and do some Back2MAC exchanges - yay for free makeup!

okay so WOW i sound like one of those shopping ditzes. i swear, we did other things....okay, no, we didn't, but...i can't believe Christmas is only a week away.

we are all caught up on Heroes, tho, so that's something. i still have to watch the last two episodes of Dexter and we're hopelessly behind on Studio 60. we need a bigger house so we can have a christmas tree."

CAN I DANCE AT THE ART OPENING?

Unfortunately, if you are Caucasian, you are genetically incapable of being able to 'dance' --
as you call it. You may, however, find that by swaying your hips arrhythmically and moving your arms
slightly from side to side, you are able to perform a crude approximation of the activity, which, when
glanced at from a distance by fellow party-goers (who's judgment have been mildly impaired by dim lighting,
the consumption of alcohol and/or other mildly mind altering substances), may actually pass as dancing,
and in turn might slightly improve your chances of having sex sometime in the near future."

I get to learn lots of things about other photographers, how they think, why they have taken pictures.. and this way I understand and sometimes get confused too regarding why I take photographs..

This sneezing and sore/dry throat is really getting annoying in the night-morning, I don't know what is it.. if I am allergic to something.. perhaps to winter... *shrugs* it happens, but this time is really annoying is not letting me sleep well at night.. *sighs*

This semester promises to be really stressing (although I get to take mugshots of the people in my generation for the catalogue, well I get to takes lots of pics for the catalogue, but I am excited for the mugshots)..  I can't wait for reading week.. heh.. hurray!!

I know had some things I needed to write here but suddenly they are all gone..

Each morning I appear
to lie at you feet
all day I will follow
no matter how fast you run
yet I almost perish...
in the midday sun - What am I?"

"event","When the earth was still flat,
And the clouds made of fire,
And mountains stretched up to the sky,
Sometimes higher,
Folks roamed the earth
Like big rolling kegs.
They had two sets of arms.
They had two sets of legs.
They had two faces peering
Out of one giant head
So they could watch all around them
As they talked; while they read.
And they never knew nothing of love.
It was before the origin of love.

The origin of love

And there were three sexes then,
One that looked like two men
Glued up back to back,
Called the children of the sun.
And similar in shape and girth
Were the children of the earth.
They looked like two girls
Rolled up in one.
And the children of the moon
Were like a fork shoved on a spoon.
They were part sun, part earth
Part daughter, part son.

The origin of love

Now the gods grew quite scared
Of our strength and defiance
And Thor said,
""I'm gonna kill them all
With my hammer,
Like I killed the giants.""
And Zeus said, ""No,
You better let me
Use my lightening, like scissors,
Like I cut the legs off the whales
And dinosaurs into lizards.""
Then he grabbed up some bolts
And he let out a laugh,
Said, ""I'll split them right down the middle.
Gonna cut them right up in half.""
And then storm clouds gathered above
Into great balls of fire

And then fire shot down
From the sky in bolts
Like shining blades
Of a knife.
And it ripped
Right through the flesh
Of the children of the sun
And the moon
And the earth.
And some Indian god
Sewed the wound up into a hole,
Pulled it round to our belly
To remind us of the price we pay.
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile
Gathered up a big storm
To blow a hurricane,
To scatter us away,
In a flood of wind and rain,
And a sea of tidal waves,
To wash us all away,
And if we don't behave
They'll cut us down again
And we'll be hopping round on one foot
And looking through one eye.

Last time I saw you
We had just split in two.
You were looking at me.
I was looking at you.
You had a way so familiar,
But I could not recognize,
Cause you had blood on your face;
I had blood in my eyes.
But I could swear by your expression
That the pain down in your soul
Was the same as the one down in mine. 
That's the pain,
Cuts a straight line
Down through the heart;
We called it love.
So we wrapped our arms around each other,
Trying to shove ourselves back together.
We were making love,
Making love.
It was a cold dark evening,
Such a long time ago,
When by the mighty hand of Jove,
It was the sad story
How we became
Lonely two-legged creatures,
It's the story of
The origin of love.
That's the origin of love."

Don't know if I should

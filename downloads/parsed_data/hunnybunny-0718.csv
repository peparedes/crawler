"event","finding out, that for a long time some one has fellings for you is shocking. the one person who you loved and lost but you never let go. relizing that old love sparks again and new love forms. but unlikely not notised that the love that was once lost will never be found. because the concequences of lost love is to find a new. and then you will be shocked to see the real person come out. then wishing to have a new start will once again be rejected and no one but yourself will be sorry. so once you find love don't screw it up or else you may never get another chance. 



BEAUTIFUL don't you agree well this is to the ones who want some advice on old ones that you once loved and to c if they will ever come back. 

thats enough about that lets talk about my day... my day was wonderful and exciting and i can't wait for tomarrow and i want to see the people in upward bound again cuz i just relised that they are the coolest people in the world and i hope that they goo all the years.. it is going to be so much fun. :D well i hope everything will turn out better for everyone. including friends that need all of my help i hope that the little gifts that i give will be helpful. i hardly even know if anything will be good for them and any one alse i try to be helpful but i think people don't understand that it's hard for me to solve problems that i haven't been in my self thats why every time some one asks me a questions ave advice for you that means i have been in that situation well i love you all...... HLK <3 E> lots of love to you all!!"

<lj-cut text=""doo dooo stuff"">

<b>Full Character Name</b>: Anemone

<b>Rank/Title (if applicable)</b>: Nirvash typetheEND pilot.

<b>Canon (indicate anime, manga, game version if there are distinctions)</b>: Eureka 7 (animeverse)

<b>Setting of Origin (country, year, planet name, descriptive, flowery language goes here if unknown specifically, approximate to our time)</b>: Sometime waaaaaay in the future (10,000 years??) on Earth.

<b>Typical Style of dress (pics are awesome)</b>: There's text on it but yay too lazy to find another image. *o*

<img src=""http://img366.imageshack.us/img366/1218/anemoneeeeeent3.jpg"">

<b>Anything for aura readers/reiatsu users/sixth sense folks to pick up</b>: Nothing. :B

<b>Jusenkyo (spring) curse?</b> Negative!

<b>Other typical status changes, island-borne or canon</b>: ... If status change involves having a split personality-ish thing? Then yeah. :D Normally, she's just a pain in the ass girl who likes laughing at people and doing things for her own amusement. After getting medication, she's a pain in the ass girl who wants to kill you. Yaaaaay.

<b>What will incite emo?</b> Anything involving her life before she got involved with the military (she'd brush it off most of the time though, so you'd have to dig deep on this one), failure, losing, etc. etc.

<b>Rage?</b> ... lol what doesn't anger her--I mean. Not getting what she wants, people insulting her or Gulliver, just... er. She gets angry a lot okay she has mood swings.

<b>NO U response?</b> Please look above.

<b>How do they see the Island, in a symbolic, metaphorical sense</b>: It's sort of like a playground to her. She doesn't have to fight, she has people to order around, it even has neat little events to keep her entertained!! In short, she really... doesn't mind being here. But she's still waiting for Dewey to come galloping in on a white horse and take her back home since yeah, lots of people still piss her off here. :B"

<b>-Threadhopping with this character - yes, no, or what?</b>: As long as it's not marked private, go ahead.

<b>-Hugging this character?</b>: Do you like punches to the face?

<b>-Giving this character a kiss?</b>: Do you like punches to the face followed by a kick to the crotch?

<b>-Punching this character (provided they are given an opportunity to fight back)</b>: Go ahead?! Although I must warn you if Haine finds out that you were really trying to SERIOUSLY injure her, uh... |D;;

<b>-Is there anything YOU DO NOT WANT MENTIONED near this character?</b>: Er Anemone has serious mood swings so a topic that'd be fine one moment might be DO NOT WANT in another. But a good way to avoid this is to not mention her life before she got involved with the military (parents, etc.) or Dewey not loving her. 

<b>-Is there anything you need us to KNOW about interacting with this character? Special physical features, fighting abilities, STUFF</b>: LOLOL GIANT ROBOT FUCK YEAH. Also she has crazy headaches that she needs to take an injection for, and this injection makes her, um, murderous? So yeah, please to be avoiding her if that happens.

<b>-ANYTHING ELSE PLEASE MENTION HERE</b>: She thinks cute things are delicious. :Db"

<lj-cut text=""La la stuff."">

OKAY. If it wasn't obvious enough, Anemone thinks she's better than everyone. Actually, it's more like she thinks everyone is worthless with the exception of Dewey, who she basically adores like whoa. In her eyes, Dewey is the one who saved her, even though it's hinted that Dominic was the one who actually found her. And Dewey doesn't give a shit about Anemone either, she's just the only girl who survived the experiments.

So, even though she <I>says</i> that she likes you, or that you're fun or cute or tasty whatever, she really doesn't care about you. Quite honestly, she'd only even really notice if something happened to like Haine, since then she'd have to find a new babysitter for Gulliver. Or if something happened to Eureka, and that's only because Anemone is the one who's supposed to kill Eureka, and if something happens to her it means that she failed Dewey.

AND FAILING DEWEY = NOT AN OPTION. In the anime, Anemone gets <i>really really</i> depressed because she's not able to defeat the Nirvash <s>because Renton and Eureka cheated ftw</s>. She even ends up drugging herself to go on a suicide mission, and she HATES her drugs. So, yeah, if she feels like she's about to lose or die, she'll freak out and attack you in order to make sure Dewey doesn't stop caring about her.

And I'm jumping all over the place here but lol should probably cover the drugs since they're a bit important. They're probably the strongest medication on the Island. Anemone experiences headaches, nosebleeds and other mental conditions--a side effect from being modified to be a fake Coralian--that the drugs temporarily treat. They... basically calm her down, and make her more bloodthirsty.  She can't pilot theEND without the injection, since she freaks out before having to battle. So if she doesn't take the drugs, she'll have to go through skull shattering pain, but if she does she's most likely going to attempt to kill you on sight lol have fun with that."

"event","Relationship list for Anemone. \o\ It'd be too annoying to have this on the wiki.

<lj-cut text=""The Relationships of a Crazy Bitch."">

<b>Renton</b>;; She has very mixed feelings about Renton. One on hand, he's the enemy. She knows that he pilots the Nirvash, and that he has ties with Gekko State. Anemone wants to please Dewey and defeat the boy, but two things stop her. One: She'd have to pilot theEND to fight the Nirvash, and she <i>really</i> does not want to do that. Two: She likes him. Not the ""lol I have a crush"" kind of like. Renton just amuses her more than anyone else. She doesn't really understand him, though, so the urge to want to learn why he acts the way he does makes her not want to hurt him. So, yes, only time will tell with what will happen with these two. They are also roommates.

<b>MOMO</b>;; Anemone likes teasing the poor girl. A lot. Probably because she like<s>s</s>d Renton. She just wants to see the loli snap one day. Or burst out crying. Or something. Anemone basically thinks of MOMO as a little pet, a very delicious looking one.

<b>Nill</b>;; Even though she thinks that Nill and MOMO are on the same level of cuteness, Anemone is generally very nice to Nill. It's mainly the wings. She really wants to see Nill fly one of these days, but she's not holding her breath on that. She made Nill promise that she'd always like her, even if Anemone did something bad.

<b>Sora</b>;; The first person to ever tell Anemone that he was her friend. So, yeah, she thinks of him very highly. Another one who she considers a pet, he just doesn't know it. Yet.

<b>Jr.</b>;; Haaaaates. Well, not really hates, he just... annoys the hell out of her. Half because he shot at her, and the other half because he keeps on bursting in on conversations she has with MOMO. If she ever takes her medication, he'd be the first person she looks first.

<b>Mamimi</b>;; Most likely her BFF on the Island. Girls with mental problems go great together. Most of their conversations don't make an ounce of sense, but they do like talking about having pets. Mamimi is probably the person who Anemone will first tell about her medication to.

<b>Haine</b>;; Amazingly, she gets along with him veeeery well, despite the fact that so far they don't know each other's names. Anemone thinks that Haine is interesting and funny, which isn't what most people would think of him as. She also does not find him stepping away from her <s>even though he forgets to do that a lot</s> weird at all.

<b>Dante</b>;; She actually hates this one. Anemone thinks that he should mind his own business about matters involving Renton. She wants to claw his eys and put them on display in front of the cave she shares with Renton very much.

<b>Luki</b>;; Thinks she's adorable, and loves her for doing her hair. Anemone wants to meet Noki very, very much. Luki's hyperness makes Anemone laugh.

<b>Vaan</b>;; Anemone's official pet. And he's official because he actually agreed to it. She has lots of things planned for him, but she'll mainly use him to babysit Gulliver.

<b>Fran</b>;; The coolest thing since sliced bread. Anemone wants to invite Fran over for dinner one of these days, and just play with her ears. Or ask her questions about what it's like having those ears. Or if she likes carrots.

<b>Haruhi</b>;; She became Anemone's rival the moment Anemone denied her the ownership of Gulliver. If they ever do a bitch battle one day, it will surely be epic. But for now she's just content with not having to deal with her that much.

More to come later. \o\"

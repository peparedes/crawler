I had a huge party for the 4th with all my family and friends, and my parents friends, and Jesse's family. So it was hectic. I had to cook, clean, and set up. And then once it was over I had to clean everything and put everything back in the right place so I was sooo worn out. Then on the third my friend Kay and I went and got a pregnancy test and it came out positive. So that is freaking me out. I'm just not sure I'll be a good Mom. I know Jesse will be an awesome Dad. I just don't think I will be good enough. I have a problem I think that there might be a chance that Zac could be the Dad because I had sex with him shortly before Jesse. I don't know the exact date of conception but I'm just nervous. What would I do?

Anyway ... Nothing else has really went on here. Jesse is coming next weekend, so we will probably go to the doctors. I haven't been throwing up yet ... thank God! I do get hungry a lot more. I don't want to get fat :( Thats gonna suck big time.

I saw Spider Man 2 this past weekend. It was pretty good. I hope Jesse and I will be able to go once he gets here. I think he'll like it. 

I can't wait till Jesse moves back here because we'll get to spend so much time together. It'll be great. I am so in love with him. I can't imagine my life without him. I'm so glad he decided he needed me as well.

Well I gotta go ... I'm hungry. I'll post soon!

"event","Well the reason Jesse wasn't home was probably because he was taking Kate to the airport. I dunno. Well he made me go home Friday because he said he had something to do that was going to take all night and he didn't want me to have to be here all by myself but then I later found out Kate was there which is fishy. 

Jesse and I had a long talk once I got to California. We decided to get back together but things still aren't the same. I feel like he is always gonna love someone else. He tells me he loves me but I don't know if he actually means it or not. I am glad we got back together though. I love the feeling of being with him.

I did something that I shouldn't have done. But it was so good I don't regret it! I had sex with Jesse's friend. Ahhh it was good. I feel bad because I hurt Jesse. We weren't together though. I hope he isn't going to be mad at him. Well I told Jesse about it and he told me that he had sex with Kate. I knew they did something like that. I wish she would stay away. She can die for all I care. She screwed up my life. Everything was going so good till he met her. We had no problems or anything. We never even fought. 

Kay and I hung out all day today. We went swimming and walked to Subway which was fun! 

I have to go

"event","Yesterday I flew to California to surprise Jesse and he wasn't here. I guess he was supposed to be hanging out with his friend Zac but he came home and Jesse didn't. So I have no clue where he is and he isn't answering his cell phone. He didn't come home all night. I really hope he's ok.

I don't know what I am expecting to get from coming to see him. I doubt he will want to get back together or anything. I seriously think he is like in love with Kate. Does he not understand she has a boy friend of like 3 years and probably won't want to have anything to do with him. He just met her anyway so I don't see how he can say he's in love with her and he's known me for 2 years and says he's not in love with me. I don't see whats so good about her that I don't have. I really love being with Jesse  he makes me feel so happy, so complete. I don't know what to do without him. I always imagined us to be together forever and now we're not. His parents love me and mine love him. So it's perfect! Just thinking about it hurts my heart so much. I just want to sit here and cry so hard. I hate knowing that he wants to be with other girls and not me. It's not fair! Why is when you think you have found the perfect guy something always has to get messed up. I just feel like I could never love someone as much as I love him. No one will ever be able to make me feel the way he does. There is no guy that could ever take Jesse's place in my heart. I love him so much and always will.

Well I am gonna head to the shower, I'm dirty. lol

"event","This journal isn't going to staring off all that great. 

This journal isn't going ot be getting off to a good start. My boy friend of 6 months broke up with me this weekend. I have been crying non-stop. It's something I really can't deal with. I really am in love with him and he says he never even was in love with me. I don't get it! Who could he be in love with? I can't believe this is happening I always pictured us together forever. But I guess I was wrong. I haven't told my parents because I am hoping he'll realize he made a mistake and want to get back together and if they know he broke my heart they won't let me :( This hurts my heart so much to think he never loved me and after I've loved him all this time. He is the sweetest guy I have ever known. I rad his live journal and he said he is in love with someone else? Who? I don't nderstand how he could be with me for 6 months and say he was never in love with me and that now he loves somebody else.

Kate was supposed to be my friend and now she spent the whole weekend at Jesse's knowing how I felt about him and not even caring that I was hurting what kind of friend is that? It just makes me jealous that she is there spending so much time with him, although I know she isn't his type anyway. Her ears and nose are too big. And plus she is too needy and clingy. I can see why Zac never wants to spend any time with her and makes himself so busy all the time. 

This weekend I didn't do anything really. I was planning to go to Cali to visit Jesse but that didn't work out. My friend Claire dragged me out of the house Sunday to go and see Harry Potter 3. It was such a good movie! I loved it! I want to go and see it again. It was kinda sad though, so of course I cried. Plus Jesse and I were supposed to go and see it.

Well I have to go and clean my room so I'll write more later

Oh and Jesse I love you so much why are you doing this?? I thought you loved me. Can we please talk?

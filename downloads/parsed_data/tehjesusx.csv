---Ross, Trina told me you could order heart shaped pizzas from pizza hut. And thats about the coolest thing ever. So I looked for a Pizza Hut in Texas, but I don't know which Pizza Hut you live by, or if there are any Pizza Huts in Texas. Maybe you guys eat at Dominos or some craaap. So I decided to scratch that idea. So then I thought about a singing telegram. But with my luck, your mom would open the door and be in *KA-shock* because a singing telegram was telling her how crazy sexy cool her son was. So I scratch that idea.<br> So all I know how to do now is just tell you that you're the most awesome fellow that I've ever met. && I totally love you. The end.<br>

Ay ay ay. Well 3 guys from detroit came up with techno. Thats all I want to say about that. And some people can't take hints. And others take hints too far. And others make up their own hints. And I never see anyone anymore because of this gayface new schedule. *tear* I miss Emma and Jeromey. And I see too much of Garet. ha. Just KIDDING! No one can ever see too much of Garet. That kid is boss. So I'm pretty chill about everything now. Except Trina. Who pisses me off a lot of the time. With her modeling. And that. urgh. Whenever Ryan is around she seems like shes pissed off all the time. And like we don't matter and she'd rather be with her boy boy boy boyfriend. And that makes me cry because she is such a blast full of fun when he's not around. And I feel like she's drifting away from me. And I try to be supportive of her but somehow it seems like I just piss her off more. I hate that Ryan fool. I hate him some good. Well all I can say. The end/"

"event","<font size=1>Since when do you need a fuckin' degree in music to listen to punk rock? And techno? And ska? Theres so many fuckin' types of everything that you need to make a list to keep up, so you can look totally ""hip to the scene"" in front of your mates. Trina, you will play a fucking ringtone on your god damn cell phone, and when I don't know the name of the song, band who played it, album it was on, date it was released, record label it was on, etc. you will freak the fuck out. Because I don't know fucking Yes songs from back in the day because of your cell phone going ""bipty bip bip bip"" you say something along the lines of:<br>
""HAHAH! YOU ARENT HXC WTF?!?! YOU DONT KNOW A YES SONG FROM BACK IN THE DAY!!!""<br>
And I pigeon-hole'd Trina because I thought the Yes song example was particularly funny. All of a sudden I'm supposed to be able to distinguish trance from jungle and drum/bass from electra. I'm fucking sick of it. So I looked it up. I looked fucking everything up. Im so hip to the scene now, that I'm a fucking scene encyclopedia. Of up to 8 different scenes. So today I'm going to help you all out by giving you a hip-to-the-scene lesson in ska. Behold a scenario, in which you COULD be potentially embarrased by not being hip to the scene, but thanks to me, you are saved.<br>
<font color=blue>THESKAMASTER!!@!@2:</font> So you like ska music, huh?<br>
<font color=red>YOUYOUYOUOYYOU:</font> Yeah...<br>
<font color=blue>THESKAMASTER!!@!@2:</font> Name ONE second wave ska band, you poser.<br>
<font color=red>YOUYOUYOUOYYOU:</font>
WELL! The Specials were a second wave/two-tone ska band from the record label 2tone which was started by Jeffery Dammers, who was also a band member of the Specials. It was a UK based label, and the whole ska scene started in England because Jamaicans came over and shared the love that is Ska music. It was called two-tone because ska music was a unity that brought black and white people together in harmony. So 2tones logo was a man wearing a black suit and a porkpie hat. And it was all black and white. And there were checkers. And thats why checkers are totally COPYRIGHT!! R! TM! to the Ska music scene. GOD FORBID YOU WEAR ANYTHING WITH CHECKERS! KNOCK THAT CHESS BOARD OFF YOUR TABLE! THATS COPYRIGHT TO SKA!<br> And there you have it, folks. Tomorrows lesson is in Techno. Followed by a whole week of punk rock! Consider yourself hip to the scene."

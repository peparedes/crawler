"event","My Roomie loves Club Vinyl.  I.....do not.  The only club I really have fun at is Tracks...I don't have to worry about perverted guys.....only perverted girls...they are easier to deal with.

Anyways... She and Shanae went to Vinyl last night.  Good for them.  Bad for me.  They brought back like 8 people to the house.  At first it was fine...shew oke me up for a second to says he brought some random people over.  An hour or so later, they had the TV blasted and were playing a long round of King's Cup.

I woke up.  Grr.

I joined them.  Not with the drinking, but with the socializing.  At this point, Krystie was trashed(Krystie is my roommate)...so she was in no shape to supervise the other 8 drunkards in the house.  So I stayed up.  At one point, she locked herself in her room with a guy(no sex).... and the other people wanted to leave.  I wanted to go to sleep because I have work today.  After ilke 40 minutes...they finally come out.  the people finally leave.

Maybe I can has sleep now?

nope.  Krystie turned into a sobbing drunk.  I wasn't mad at her, but I worry about her.  She's one of my best friends... I don't like to cry.  But when you are drunk, you don't rationalize anything.  It sucks.  It took a long time for us to get her to go to sleep.

finally, 5:45am-6am...I get sleep.  I wake up 3 hours later because I have to get ready for work.  When I went to bed originally, I had given myself time for like 8 hours of sleep.  Soooo did not happen. *sniffles*

But when she was drunk, she was talking about her ""boy"".... made me grumble.  I have been having slight boy issues for a while now.  There is this guy I like..have liked him for years, but he won't date me because he ""doesn't want to ruin the friendship we already have"".  Bah.  but he came to hang out the other day and did things, flirtatious things, that he have never done before...  things thats people usually only do when they like someone.  Unless he wanted to be REALLY REALLY evil and play a big joke on me.  so now I don't know if he would actually date me...and it's bugging me.  I want to ask him, but I don't want things to become awkward if it wasn't serious.  So I sent Shanae in to talk to him.  She's a third person outsider.  I really hope it works.  *sigh*"

"event","A while ago...in the mid 90's... I playeda game called The Realm.  It was an RPG game that was popular at the time.Still kinda is now...nothing like WOW, though.

I met a guy on there.  We became VERY good friends over the years.  If we ever lost contact, we'd pick up right where we left off when we spoke again.  For a while, he rejected a lot of his friends...never me.  They were always curious why he was still my friend.  I never gave up on him.

Now, finally, he says that it's the only purely logical conclusion he can come to...for us not to be friends, not to worry about each other, etc.  Just assume that hte other one is okay wherever they are and not  give it another thought.  I'm not that kind of person; I can't do that.  When he talks about not being friends, I even start crying.  It hurts because he's been my friend for so long.

I don't know what to do.  Someone give me some advice?"

"event","Finals are over. Good.  I have realized that my professors love me and I feel like a teacher's pet all the time.  I really don't try to.  My german professor is in awe of how fast I pick up german.  I guess I never knew how good I was at languages?  i always thought it was just Japanese...that whole ""I <3 Anime"" thing; I learned a lot of Japanese by watching Anime in Japanese with subtitles.  I took Japanese for years in High school and another term in college.  Too bad the university doesn't have  Japanese class of a high enough level to keep me interested.  I'll try to get to Kaiwa at least once a month, though.... My sorority can't beat me up for once a month, right?

Anyways, another Teacher's pet experience.  We've already mentioned this.  My english professor, stunned to find out that I write all of the essays for her class while on the way to class the day it's due.  What can I say? I am a fast typer.  Cheers to forum-based RPGs and creative writing how-to's.  I are the awesome-sauce.

Next term I am taking Bio, College Algebra(Easy A), ROTC(I think), and German.  I mentioned this before in my other update.  I might switch ROTC out for chemistry instead.  But I think that might be too many science classes in one term.  I talked to my friend and she tells me that I could be a good bio//chem major.  I love science, I'm good at math...and I love it... and I get excited when I read medical articles.  They think I'll be good at this.  I hope they are right.

I  turn 21 in less than 2 months.  I'm excited but worried.  I don't want to get alcohol poisoning, but I want to go through it in style.  Now where's the balance? lol

I think that's all for now.  Tata!!!"

"event","So school has kicked my butt.  It's official.  I have spent the last weeeks studying for tests and essays and everything necessary to pass.  I'll do fine, but it was still hard.  Next term will be easier because I think I will be more used to it.  My classes:

Biology I
College Algebra
German II
ROTC MS-2

Everything is final...except maybe the ROTC.  I haven't decided if I want it or not.

Krystie and I are fully moved into our new place now, all we need left is the house-warming party... I really do want to have it soon(Dusty, you really dunno when Doug-san's will be?  And do you mean his place in Japan? He's still there, yes?

Now that term is over, I'm happy to say I can return to Kaiwa.  It just so happened that I joined a sorority JUST after returning to Kaiwa...what sucks is that they have meetings at 7pm on wednesdays.  I'm free now, though."

recently, I've been having a lot of ups and downs.  At work, I slept in on saturday on accident and we opened the store an hour and a half late because of me.  I was glad that my boss forgave me.  The next day helped with that, though.  I came into the store to find a note saying we needed to get a plumber in here to fix our sink.  I called our GM, then called the plumber.  they made the drains wrong and it didn't fit properly.  He told us not to open the store until they were completely finsihed...and it worked.  So at 12:30, we opened Jamba Juice.....we usually open at 8.  My boss was proud of how well I handled the entire situation, delegating and organizing what needed to be done.  There were times when I had my boss on my cell phone, our district manager on one line of the work phone, and hte sink contractor on the second line of the work phone.  It was an interesting day at work.

At home, I've been preparing to move.  I rented a new townhome recently with my best friend.  WE will now live at 32nd and Lawrence, 18 blocks form my campus.  I'm excited for it, and I have already started to move things.  If anyone wants to see the new place, let me know.  I'll also hopefully have pictures up soon as well.  I'll post as well an invite for when we have the housewarming party.

I registered for my classes for the spring already.  I'll take biology, college algebra, german II, and ROTC.  I'm excited for it, although not as excited for the PT aspect of the ROTC....I know I need it, though, so I am ok."

"event","I lost my passport.  I didn't realize this until some guy called me and said he found it on campus.  He said he was going to turn it into the lost and found....he never did.  That was over a month ago.

Today, I get a phone call from the campus police.  They have my passport.  woot.  End of story, lol.  Happy ending and all that jazz.

Also, I am happy with the election results.  I voted for Obama, and it's good to finally see the person I voted for actually win.  *shrugs*  I am proud to be american at this point in time.  Obama has a lot of work in front of him.  I wish him luck.

Also, initiation for my sorority is this saturday.  I'm a little nervous.  I don't know why I don't seem to be getting along with as many people as I wanted to, but I don't know how to fix it.  I was always the person who was able to go up to anyone and just talk.  This is the first time I didn't know what to say.  I can't be vulgar, they don't always get my sarcasm/satirical comments, and I...I dunno.  I guess this is a lesson in how to talk to people I wouldn't normally hang around with. I just wanted to have a big group of girls that I could look to for advice on girl things, things that none of my guy friends can help me with.  I just hope it all turns out for hte best.

I also ran out of books to read....again.  I read too fast. I finished the David Pelzer series in 2 days(A Child called ""IT"", The Lost boy, etc)....I need something to do when I sit on busses for 8 hours a day(complete exagerration."

"event","So I've been taking German since August.  I find out now from my friends husband(who is german) that our professor's accent is all wrong.  He doesn't pronounce the umlauts correctly, nor does he pronounce a lot of the words right.  So I'm hoping that if I stay with this professor, I can learn my umlauts elsewhere.  Other than that, I adore my german class, the people in it, and the way we learn.  It's fun.

My english professor thinks I should go into a writing minor.  What she doesn't know is that every essay I have written for that class, even up to a 4-page paper, has been written on the bus/lightrail on the way to class on the day it was due.  Never before that.  The fact that she thinks they are worthy of a writing minor surprises me a little bit.  I don't even know if writing as a minor does much good.  it's kinda like the song ""What do you do with a BA in English"" in a way.  Oh well"

Nooow.I was trying to play a CD and my CD player wont work.  It makes me sad.  There is also a big dent in the bottom of it which I think is part of the problem.  Time for Geek Squad.

I'm not too worried for now, though.  It works fine for everything else. ans sometimes the CD player works.  I'm a little too busy lately to worry about it.  I got a notice from my boss that they want to promote me even farther in the company.  I was surprised, but happy.  I would be a salaried employee, and since Jamba Juice ""promotes healthy living"" they have a shorted time frame for how many hours you cant work over.  It works well that way, so I wont end up working twice as much.  I wouldn't be able to anyways.  I have school, lol"

Brett Favre.  Thanks Dusty for telling me I should start with him.  He regularly does amazing..and last I got over 30 points with him.  Definitely a better choice.  bad news, he had a bye week this week, so I dealt with Jason Campbell who only got me 8 points.  It looks like I'm still going to win, though.  *cheers*  My RBs and WRs did nicely this week..and The panthers did the best they've done all season on defense.  Score for me.

I just feel slightly bad because Tanya hasn't won a game yet...and She had a chance to beat me this week but bye weeks killed us all.

Also, I got pledged into the sorority, I dunno if I mentioned that.  I'm now in a college sorority...all should run for the hills, lol.  We had a retreat this weekend and I had a blast.... I'll put pictures up soon.  Girls are definitely crazy.  The only thing I hate about the sorority is that everything is on Wednesday nights.  So although I wanted to go to Kaiwa more, now I can't go at all.  I'm going to ask them if I can go to Sorority every other week and go to Kaiwa every other week.

Also, I'm typing this from the loverly Oregon Capital....*huggles Salem*  I'm with Sammi and I'm having fun.  I'll put all pictures up later this week from Denver.

Quick Post, but I have to catch a bus! *hugs everyone who reads this* Bye!!"

"event","So I was at work yesterday and I asked him ""If you schedule me to work tomorrow, can you not schedule me past 5:30pm?"" and our GM replied with ""I don't even have you scheduled to work tomorrow.  So I left work thinking that I wasn't going to be working today.... I called work today to see what my schedule was for tomorrow and they were like ""You come in today anyways.""  And I was in shock.  Usually they call the people that work the next day and let them know that they work if the schedule gets made that late.  I never got a call.((well, now that I check my voicemail on the Cell phone I LOST.....I have a voicemail.  He knows tocall me on my mom's cell until I get a new phone because I always forget to check those voicemails.)) *sigh*  So supposedly I'm going into work today.  Goodie me.  And I close too! working until like 10:30pm.

And to top it all off, he has me scheduled from 6:30am tomorrow morning until 3pm.  I have a class that starts at 1 and I would have to leave there by noon to get there on time.  Yeah.. I'm DEFIITELY going to be working until 3pm tomorrow.  NOT!  he knows my class schedule.  He should know better.  I know he was trying hard to still give me lots of hours even though I asked for hte whole weekend of because this weekend is Nan Desu Kan, but he didn't need to try that hard.  *dies*"

"event","So I didn't have a chance to get home to my computer in time to switch my QB from Derek Anderson to Brett Favre.  It only would have gotten me 3 points, though...and although it would have put me in like 3rd place in the league....I'm in 4th as it stands...not too shabby for my first year.  I still would have lost the game I'm in against this league guy.  He's a friend of my mom's and he made a good team.  Although it's probably all luck because he pretty much just picked the Pittsburgh Steelers team.  85% of his team is from pittburgh...even his defense is.  I dunno.

I got 88 points this week, so I am feeling pretty good at least.  I dunno what an average score for a FFL team is these days, but I feel good about it anyways, lol.  I was only 7 points off the highest score in our league.  *shrugs*  I'm having fun...that's all that counts, yes?"

"event","So I went to my english class today and got my homework back....got nearly a perfect score....and I had stupid mistakes.....considering I typed it on the bus on the way to class that day, I was proud.  It's far too easy, lol.  She actually tells me I can't answer anymore because she knows I know it. *dies*


I also got my german test back.  For the record, I dont like his style of testing.  You get one page, finish it, turn it in, get the next page, etc and so on until it's over.  It's tedious.  Although I still got a 95%.  That's pretty good.  It's higher than anyone else I am friends with in the class, lol.  And it was over stupid spelling mistakes.  And not even good spelling mistakes...NUMBERS!

Okay, so 9 is spelled ""neun""....I accidentally spelled it ""neon""......
But when he asks me to spell ""excuse me"" in german, I can easily pull ""Entschuldigung"" outta my arse.  I can also spell ""Postleitzahl"" and ""die Vorlesung"" and all the long words....but a simple 4 letter word just kills me.

And hte hardest part about German for me is listening to all the miss-pronunciations in class.  When we started the language he spent a whole class on how to pronounce ""ch"" in german because it's everywhere.  it's not a ""chuh"" sound or a ""k"" sound....it's kinda weird...but once you get it you have it.  But I always hear the ""k"" sound in class...constantly.  And the ""S"" sounds like a Z, and a few other things...people just read it as plain english and it bugs me."

"event","Fantasy Football taught my I know absolutely nothing about football.  I thought I was rather knowledgeable when it came to football.  When I was in high school we were required to know how to play in order to be in marching band.  They wanted people to know when to play for what without having to be told.  It worked rather well.  We all gained a small love for football.

So here my mom comes asking me to join her FF Leaque because she needs more players.   I joined, thinking it could be fun, and sat around for like 10 hours researching and figuring out the ins and outs of it all.

We had our draft yesterday.  Aside from the fact that 4 people didn't show up so we had a bunch of autopicks(a lot of the Wide receivers and running backs were gone because the autopick picks a lot of them...my sisters bench was completely full with JUST running backs and wide receivers) and then we had our picks.

I got:
QB: Derek Anderson from Cleveland(Who I forgot had a concussion, although they said he would be okay by game day)
RB: Brian Westbrook
RB: Jamal Lewis
RB/WR: Patrick Crayton
WR: Terrell Owens
WR: Plaxico Burress
TE: Kellen Winslow
D/ST: Seahawks D/ST
K: Nate Keading

Bench:
QB: Brett Favre (He retired and then came back to play for a different team.  Seeing how this goes???
RB: Ladell Betts (Never even really seen him play much
RB:Rashard Mendenhall (A rookie who I wanna see how he does.....see if he'll be good)
WR: Isaac Bruce (my computer lagged out and I accidentally picked him instead of a backup kicker, lol)
WR:Reggie Brown
D/ST: Packers D/ST
TE: Dallas Clark


We're gonna see how this turns out......yeah, I'm slightly anxious for week one, lol"

"event","Yes, so today was my first official day as a manager.  I have worked other shifts as a manager, but with another manager assisting.   I was in training.  Sooooo.... I swear, it's jinxed.


When Claire, another manager, was about to leave, she told me that it had been a really quiet day.  It was Labor Day after all.  Everyone was gone.  So I wasn't too worried.  I went into the back to fill out some paperwork to start my shift, something I was completely used to.  Jaki(A new employee) comes into the back room with a set of keys saying someone left them here on accident.  I tell her ""Go put it under the registers.  Thats where our lost and found is""....in those words.  She nods and leaves.

So here is what she did.  OUr registers, probably like most, lift out of the drawers so you can take them and put the money in the safe.  She decided to lift that part(the part where credit card receipts go) and put the keys there.  Now, one might have thought that when the drawer wouldn't close without her showing it, she might have stopped. No, not Jaki.  She shoved it closed.  It got stuck.  She was the only one on register because she doesn't know how to do anything else yet.  Caitlin(Training Mentor) comes in back and explains to me what happened.  My jaw drops.  I go out and assign someone else to the register above Jaki's.  When we don't have customers I try to open it.  It doesn't work.  I called the General Manager and left him a message.  I thought , you know, nobody really comes in the day of to get their keys back....at least not within the hour................

She came in.  We had to explain to her that her keys were stuck in the register, and I called Mike again.  He told me where the toolbox was.  So I went and we had to disconnect the drawer from the computer and take it into the back.  We realized that the computer would think that the register was opened, not disconnected.  Whenever the other girl tried to take an order it told her to ""please close the register""....we couldn't assign her to another register because it wouldn't let her de-assign from the one she had.  So we assigned nother girl to a register and went in the back to unscrew the drawer, disconnect all the cords from the springs and get the keys.

Now the day wouldn't be complete with out our very own labor day lunch rush.  When we took the drawer out, all the money fell upside down...  so we had to pick it up and clean it out and then put all the cords back in the right slots and whatnot, all while we had about 25-30 people come in per 30 minutes.   It was lovely.  I was so frustrated.  

but at least it wasn't as bad as Adam's first closing Shift(another manager).... He wanted to impress Mike(our General Manager) with how well he could do.  So he took the mop into the walk-in freezer and tried to mop it............With the first slide across the floor it froze to the floor immediately.  he tried with all his might to yank the mop off the floor but it didn't work.  So he took a scraper out and had to de-attach the mop from the floor.  At least I know I'm not alone here. *grin*"

Maybe after a while of doing this I might not trip over random pieces of carpet..... or faceplant just because my body wants to.  *nods*  Ooo, and I'll get all in shape and that good stuff, and have all the self-defense.....not that I don't carry a knife and blunt objects(my heavy purse) with me at all times anyways, hehe.  So yeah,  be prepared ofr pictures of me with bruises.  I know most people don't get bruises from something as learning how to punch correctly or kick...but trust me... I can, and probably will.  I'll move for a kick and flip myself over onto my back.  I can picture it allllllll so clearly. *laughs*

So I also wanna do some more hiking and camping than I usually do, and not just my medical support trips like normal.  I just want to go out with friends and camp.  If anyone is interested, lemme know.  Also, I need more concert buddies.  Anyone in the market for hearing some awesome local and sometimes non-local bands come play? hmmmmm?

Also, if anyone wants to go with us to Avenue Q on september 21st, buy tickets soooon.  I want as many people I know to see it as possible.  It is an amazing musical...and HEY, as I post about it, one of the songs comes on from my playlist.  Woot!  It's like it knoooooooows, hehe.

*huggles her LJ*  I seem to be making more cheery posts than I did last time I used this journal.  That makes me happy.  Less stress is always awesome possum. *grin*

PS: Anyone know some good time-consumers for me to take up?  I hate being bored or having excess of free time.  OH! And I need more books to read.  I finished all my series' up to the where the latest books are out.  I need more reading stuff to pass time.  Any ideas peoples?"

"event","So a lot of my friends always do the whole fantasy football thing, and I never really tried it.  I just watch the games with friends and eat lots of pizza.....and doritos.   Cheers to Doritos and the Zesty taco/Chipotle Ranch Flavor.  best one out at the moment^^  So anyways, back on  track, I finally decided to try The whole fantasy Football thing this year, and our draft is on monday.  It helped me realize that I knew what teams I liked, but not the ranks of players, which were best, etc.  I don't know as much about football as I thought....Well, I know some, but this stupid game makes me feel like a  neophyte  *sigh*

Now, on a completely random note, and it really is random since I only thought of it since their song came on my WinAmp, I miss the guys from the Flobots.  They used to be nice and Local to Denver, and I could go see a show whenever I pleased...they had concerts all the time.  Now they have concerts regularly, but all across the nation.  Next month they go to Europe, and I want to go to the Dublin show because it's my friend's 18th birthday.  Too bad I can't afford it.  they have like 4 to 6 shows in germany, so Hamano....you gotta go sometime, hehe.  And then they come back for a meetup with some of us in Denver and then they go to JAPAN in the beginning of next year!!  I'm saving up for that one.  I really really am.  anyone wanna go with?  I figured this was as gooda time as any to try and get a little fluency in Japan...that whole immersion thing.  Going with other people will help, hehe.  make it less awkward *grin*

Well, gotta go.  I'm volunteering at the DNC today for the Music Festival.  Hail to the Flobots and Rage Against the Machine.  And then tonight I want to get my butt off to Kaiwa.  I miss it!  And I am determined to go there tonight.  *shakes fist*"

"event","So I forgot I had LJ.&nbsp; *nods*&nbsp; I was thinking ""where's a place to go I can post and the people I don't want to see it won't?"" and I realized, OMG I have LJ, lol.&nbsp; I'm bad, I know.&nbsp; So here's a big update and I'll probably be posting a lot more now. ^^

I'm in college now, at Metro, and I'm taking German, Japanese, computer Sciences and then some core classes.&nbsp; Some BORING core classes.&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; I love German, it's amazingly fun.&nbsp; *cheers*&nbsp; Japanese is far too easy for me and I'm thinking of dropping it.&nbsp; I'm not really learning anything.&nbsp; I absolutely adore my computer sciences class, but I might be dropping it at semester.&nbsp; I'm not sure it's for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to find something I'd do well in, and te only thing I can guarantee&nbsp; each time is languages.&nbsp; I always like the languages.&nbsp; So I know I am at least minoring in languages.&nbsp; I dunno all the good majors out there.&nbsp; I am waitlisted at Regis, and although I could go to DU, I don't want to pay the money for it when I don't know what I want to do.&nbsp; *nods* Ah, life with it's predicaments, lol.

So my friend's house burned down, and I was really sad.&nbsp; I loved that house.&nbsp; Yes i know they are rebuilding it, but there are definitely some things that won't be the same.&nbsp; Just my opinion.&nbsp; And I hope he can find the maps wallpaper again...and not keep a hutch on the patio that likes to start fires.&nbsp; 

I work at Jamba Juice now.&nbsp; I'm a team lead(AKA manager) and it's pretty cool.&nbsp; I leave work smelling like fruit when I go to class.&nbsp; I'm okay with that.&nbsp; At least I don't smell like French fries *grin*

I am looking forward to NDK in a few weeks.&nbsp; I requested it off already at work and I am extremely anxious about it.&nbsp; I want to just.....go and have gone already.&nbsp; *fawns over dealer's room savings*&nbsp; I came prepared this time.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; I'm staff for the video rooms this year(Tanya recommended it) and I still will volunteer for the Board Games with Pyro.&nbsp; It's all gonna be a blast *grin*"

I was at work this morning... and I was walking down the stairs.  On the last step down to the floor, my ankle went out and I faceplanted straight to the floor.  Can you say embarassing?!

Oh, and it made me sprain my ankle, too *shrug*  Yay! golf-ball sized swelling, lol.  Nice ACE Bandages, Niiiice, lol."

"event","lol...okay, so it was funny more than mean..but stilll...!

So I went camping with my buddies this weekend. My boy scout crew, that is. We had a lot of fun. got to hang out with a bunch of people, and I went ice fishing for the first time...and caught 2 fish! I was happy.

now for what was mean....and funny.

Friday night, Bobbie Sue told everyone that I dont wake up in the morning..that she literally thinks she is bruising me every time she wakes me up because she even resorts to hitting me to get me up...anything. Well, when I woke up of my own volition on Saturday at 6:30 in the morning, they didn't believe her.

Then I fell asleep in the afternoon. Here is a list of what they said they did..and yes, there is video and picture proof. I'll seeif I can get some to put up:

-they pushed me
-kicked the cot
-rolled me over
-blew off a siren right next to my ears


...
...
...
...
...
...
and now for my favorite part:

-they took a backboard and backboarded me to the cot...like a sandwich.. and they carried me outside into the snow. that was the final thing. I didn't wake up until I was in the air and halfway outside... and then I shouted ""What the Heck?!?!?!"" And they all started laughing...and they took pictures of it. And no, it wasn't the youth who did this. and why not? Oh, thats because it was every single male ADULT... not hte teens, but the guys from 21-49. Yes, one was 49. them buttheads, lol.

anyways...just sharing my funny stories. Have a nice day!"

"event","Sooo... I found out that this girl Chase Parr that I went to High school with died in a car crash with her mom and dad.  The only person who survived was her kid sister Katy... who was a sophomore when Chase and I graduated.  No, I didn't hear about her death from other high school buddies, no I didn't hear about it in the news, or from Facebook or myspace.  I was reading The letter to the editor section of the Westword, And alternative Newspaper in Denver, and I read about a guy who was touched by Patty calhoun about people she knew who got into a horrible crash and died.  It then said something about Sandy Widener, John Parr, and Chase Parr... and then it hit me.  ""Chase Parr"" sounded familiar.  I looked up her name on Google...and found my old schoolmates picture.  I was in shock.  Not only because I found out over a week after it and from some tiny little thing, but also because her sister Katy is all alone.  Katy was in the Car, and now Katy lost her sister, a hilarious person, and both her parents...and on top of it she was in intensive care in the hospital.  It was shocking.  Chase and I were in a few musicals together at East.  And we had fun when practicing the songs.  We were both in choir, and just random classes together.  We said Hi in Passing, but nothing really more... But it still hurts to know she died.  Thats the second person from my graduating class that has died within two years of our graduating year.  Really?  That scares me...

Anyways, on a lighter note, I moved out of my old house and into a house with a couple of coworkers of mine.  It's my second day here, and I love it so far.  There are three dogs and three cats here, I love the people, and if the worst thing I have to deal with is Kyle's band practicing in the basement, I'm completely okay.  Because his band has a violin player.  They win, lol.  I'm hoping, now that the busses are closer, I might be able to go back to doing things I used to before I lived in the middle of nowhere.  Okay, so I still live in the middle of nowhere, but this middle of nowhere is connected to more things, lol."

I saw the flames of hell today.
It clouds my mind and clears my head.
My clear head is my cloudy mind,
I see only death and bloody pain.
I see the world burn up in flames,
I saw the gun up to my head.
I slice my arm, crawl in to bed,
The knife still colored scarlet red.
I wake up in a pitch black room,
My eyes go black in faded pain.
I watched the world burn down last night,
Fall to the ground, reborn again.
The gun once pointed to my head,
Helped me escape, to live again.
As blood came seeping from my head,
I saw bright lights,...
I saw me dead.

WOW... I was looking at my friends poems... and I remembered that long ago I wrote a poem..and so I looked up my name.  And wow.  Did I REALLY sound like this at some point?  Are you KIDDING me?  I remember writing it...but really?  I forgot that I used to be stupid at one point.  LOL!"

By the way, the Flobots, a local band in Denver, Participated in ""hometown for the Holidays"" a contest to find the most popular local band and give them a shot out there on the radio((93.3)).... The Flobots not only got 1st place(recording time, a photoshoot, and a spot in next years ""not so silent night"" concert) but they were picked as crowd favorites of the night and got $1,000.  I am ecstatic!!!!

You should all go listen to their music at flobots.com

lol.

Anyways, So I've learned that Guitar Hero has stolen my soul, and the only way to get it back is with ROCK BAND! lol.  Oh wow, we played on Guitar hero from 7pm until 4am.  It's really REALLY sad, lol.  I also saw Sweeney Todd which was amazing, and I got a Sweeney Todd Hoodie for Christmas, lol.

Assasin's Creed Came in for christmas and I can't wait to play it! hehe.  Okay, I'm a geek, I get it.

"event","Okay, so yesterday, I get asked where an item in the store was.  I was like.. ""huh?""  And they tell me ""You were the one who did the return on this item.""  ""No I wasn't""  And it all went from there.  WE were missing 10 chess sets, hand-carved medieval sets.  It was all the same set.  After tearing the whole store apart on saturday looking for the chess sets, they knew there weren't any.  People were asking for it.  it was a set people liked.  Well, when the return was done today, they looked for the returned set and never found it.  We later found out that this was just like 9 other times when someone returned one of these chess sets,...without actually returning it, and taking the cash for themselves.  Only an employee can do this.

Well, here's the catch.  You have to be a manager to be able to do a return... or you have to have a manager's code.  The manager whose code was used for the return, well, she was at the bank when it happened.  That meant that somebody had known her code and password.  Someone that wasn't her.  So another thing is, they used my employee discount to do this, and I wasn't even on the floor to do it.  I was in the back room.  *sigh*  I missed my last bus and had troubles getting home because we all had to stay late until someone confessed or they realized nobody was...the latter happened.  we're all in danger here because we have one stupid employee.  and it sucks..

In other news, prolly gonna start at metro this spring just so I can get some prerequisites done early.

I'm sooo excited for Sam to be coming.  She gets here in 9 days!!! lol

I'm looking for a place to move into closer to town than where I am now((30 minute drive on the free way and toll way into town.))  So if you know anyone who is looking for a roommate, put in a good word for me.  Or if you know any place that has studios for less than 500, less than 400 is cooler, but I dun think that exists unless I share, which, again, is fine by me.  I'm also checking Craigslist, lol.  Well, I'm off for now."

She is always calling me a control freak, and whenever I ask her something, or show her how to do something the way I was taught to do it, she does it the exact opposite.  And she tells us not to talk about her behind her back..to talk to her...but you can hear her talking about other people.  Hypocrites.  I hate them.

"event","Okay...Rockies lost.  4-3.  I really don't understand why they had the batters they did at the bottom of the 9th...maybe some better choices could have at least gotten us some extra innings, but The Red Sox are Champs again.  And at least we got to the Series in the first place.  And we deserved to be there.

anyways, Moving on.  I'm the type of girl who likes a lot of different types of movies, but if you know me well enough to know my favorite movie of all, you'd know my favorite type.  I absolutely love American History X.  It's serious, has good themes, amazing plot and character development, talks about morals, etc..it's an all-around good film.  My favorite.  Now, I found my favorite movie so far of 2007... and there isn't much left of 2007 to change it...so lets say the best movie for me of 2007 until we find one better.  It's called Gone Baby Gone.  It's in theaters right now.  So if you hadn't guessed by  my intro with American History X... this is a more serious film.  It's got comedy, it has good characters and actors, too.  But what really gets me is how they address the questions of what is morally right compared to what is legally correct.  They do a splendid job of it... I recommend everyone see it.

<lj-cut text=""Don't read the cut if you haven't seen Gone Baby Gone yet"">
Okay, so to go more into detail, I love the way that I can guess what is going on, be completely wrong, and find that the real scenario is better than I had guessed.  It's a good way to go.  I called it when they did the ransom pickup and were going to get the girl back and they got shot at instead, but I liked the ending where they showed what really happened, and the dirty cops planned it all.  It was soo well done in my opinion.

As for the morals vs. the law theme, I found out something new about myself through this movie.  At the end, when you find out that the retired Police Captain had the girl the whole time and Patrick wants to call the cops on him and Angie tells him she'll leave him if he does, It's hard.  Amanda was happy there, happier than she would be with her real mom.  Towards the end of the movie it looks like Heleen, the mom, is cleaning up, but you s till wonder, if the girl goes back, how will her life end up?  Heleen might clean up, but her friends wouldn't.  It's hard.  My mom and I talked about it after the movie.  She asked me what I would have done. It took me a while to answer..I didn't know how to word it... my answer? ""It's hard.  I know it would have been hard for her to leave in the first place, but she would be torn from a place she now called home... she was 4 years old, so half a year to her is like a lifetime...she grew to love them soo much.  I wouldn't have called the cops on them.  I would have left her there, checked up on her, etc... I wouldn't want her to go back to her mom... not to that life.  I thought about it, and I thought about the alcohol and the drugs, etc.  She was an addict.  She went to a bar  to get drunk while her daughter was missing.  Even if she tried to clean up, she'd always be that same person...she would always have those friends who were bad influences.  She wouldn't change.  And I know the Foster care system.. I know what that life was like.  I lived that life.  That girl would have lived a horrible life, all through her childhood.  Here she was happy.  It made me realize that even though something could be legally wrong, sometimes you do it because it's so morally right.

I kinda wish they hadn't ended the movie showing us Amanda sitting like a dead Barbie doll watching cartoons and not even showing emotions on the funny parts.  Watching her mom drinking alcohol as she left her daughter home alone to go on a date, about to call her druggie friend 5 minutes before she left to babysit her kid.  It was as though nothing had changed.  She didn't change at all.  Patrick lost everything, the love of his life, his friends, the grandparents of the child, the police,...and he had murdered people... and it had all been in vain.  I didn't want that to be the ending... even though it was a well played ending.. I guess thats just my mind not wanting what I suspected to happen to be what happened.  I didn't want to be right...watch the cops take her away... that could have been the end of it...watch the Reuniting of mom and daughter....end credits... I could have had that hoped that maybe she had changed, maybe the girl would grow up in a better house... but it died..in minutes. THough I still thought it was a great ending, lol.  I'm just sentimental</lj-cut>

Moving on, Halloween is almost upon us.  I finally chose a costume.  I'm gonna be sexy Dorothy, with Toto in a basket...but just wait..thats not all...she's gonna be all bloodied up.  Scarred, and with straw in her hair, as though the witch tore up her body andh it her with a broom... hence the straw... and Toto will be bloody too.  ""And she got my little dog, too"" ahem, lol.  Yeah, sooo... I'm also g onna be barefoot.  I'll have th stockings on, but not the ruby slippers.  The wicked witch stole them back^^"

We had ESPN in our store today with some rockies players and a Broncos player...so we had a few eployees painted for the occasion.  Oh, and I have glitter on too.  It itches, but it's worth it.  We're looking forward to tonights game, and the possibility that the coaches will learn who should really be pitching against the Red Sox, and maybe we can pull it off to continue to game 5.  We're going to Coors  Field tonight to try for scalper tickets.  The Rockies Tickets have dropped considerably considetring the circumstances, but I will still go, even if they lose.  That's what a fan is.  You support them through the good and the bad...adn right now, we'd have to pull a rabbit out of our butts to do this, but my friends and I still hold faith that a miracle can happen.  *grin*  But hey! WEe made it to teh world series, we got to play against the red sox, and it's all good on this side, hehe.  We're still the national league Champions... and really, that's what counts, hehe."

"event","I still think, as I have all week, that this was a stupid way to sell the tickets.  Everyone I know that is a fan was looking for tickets(I still haven't gotten a hold of some of them to see if  they got them), but every time we got close, it would start loading, and the page would time out...forcing you to refresh on your own and start again at the back of the line.  They could have done this better.  I'm sad that I didn't get tickets, but I sat there for 2 and a half hours... until the refresh page said that the games were sold out.  It sucked.  But I'll still watch every game, lol.  We just get to have a party at home to do it.  All in all, I don't blame the rockies for the sales ideas of the tickets.. and, unlike what some people are doing, I'm not gonna stop being a fan because I didn't get tickets to the World Series they were in.  I was reading posts on some sites I am on, and people are like ""I hate the Rockies~! Stupid tix Sales! or whatever.  Don't blame the team, blame the system, lol.  Go Rox!  You can sweep the Series like you did the League."

Well guess what?  our 4th inning rocked so hard it's not even funny, lol.  with 2 outs in the 4th inning, I was happy to see a hit, then 2 scores.  Kaz came up, hit and we scored again.... and then, in wonderful rockies style, Holliday comes through with a home run for 3 more points.  In the 4th inning, with two outs already upon us, we got ourselves to a lead that the Diamondbacks couldn't aruge with. .... and then Todd helton came up and was struck out in a matter of seconds."

"event","Okay, First...update.  I decided to go as Robin from Witch Hunter Robin.

Second... my friend Pam is in the hospital in teh labor department.  Soon we will have a cute new addition, hehe.  I was there for like 6 hours, but Mike and Anna were leaving...I live with them.. story over, lol.

At the hospital, though, I saw one of my old teachers from East High.  First I saw him in registration or check-in or whatever, and thought nothing of it.  When we were heading back to the room after eating, I saw him again.... this time in the maternity ward.... and with a baby in tow.  Finds out his wife was having a baby *shock*  coincidence, no?  I thought it was funny...so did he.

Along a side note, I finally got binary explained to me...and how to easily find out how to convert a number into binary.  Well, then they showed me a joke.... and now understanding binary, I got it:

There are only 10 kinds of people in the world, those who understand binary, and those who don't.

Well, I told this to my boss at work...the big one, teh owner of the store.  Well, he asked me if I knew how to count to 132 in binary.... and I told him I could figure it out quickly, but I was wrapping.  So he comes back as I finish wrapping, and he flips me off.  Both hands up, straight at me flipping me off.  Honestly, I was a little shocked.  Then he says, ""132.""  I was like ""huh???"" so he showed me 00100001<----binary for 132.  8 numbers in binary with 2 extra fingers.  So if you take each middle finger as a 1, and each other finger as a zero, no matter which side you count from, it's 132.  So we all started a new saying.  ""132, and the horse you rode in on.""  *grin*~~"

Sounds childish, I guess, but I'm still shy sometimes when it comes to stuff like this...like openning up to people.  Which kind of sucks sometimes.  Everyone sees my exterior, my friendly nature, my ability to just run up to people, talk to them, hug them, joke with them, etc...and they think that that's just who I am... but getting close to people is hard..and I push them away.   It's really something I need to work on, and I'm trying.  I also have a problem knowing when people are joking, and when they are being serious. Because I sometimes get really pissed when someone is joking, and laugh when they are serious.  Tell me about Awkard."

"event","Wow, hey everyone! Or whoever is reading this. It's been a wicked long time since I&nbsp;posted on live journal. Hm, what's been going on? Well, I'm not in school at the moment. I am looking for a job. But I&nbsp;do babysit here in Rhode Island. (if anyone needs a babysitter).

I'm getting a huge tax return from federal and state, so all of it's going into the bank. I was suppose to move back to Chicago in October, but that failed. Oh, I&nbsp;forgot to mention that I spent some time in the windy city over the summer. It was fun. Though I&nbsp;didn't get a chance to chill with Ursla or Eli. I was suppose to when I moved back in Oct., but hopefully another time.

Truthfully, I&nbsp;miss that city, but I&nbsp;don't miss one of the people there. Hm...When I&nbsp;do go back to Chi...there's Eli, Tara, Ursla, Sydney, Julia, and a bunch more I&nbsp;know/gonna chill with. I'm looking forward to going again this summer. w00t w00t!

I also wanna make plans to go to Washington D.C to visit another old friend and his partner. Argh, so many plans but so little cash. So if anyone knows of a job that I&nbsp;could get, that would be FABULOUS! 

What else is going on? Hm, my bffl is getting married this May on the 23rd. Wicked nervous about it. We've been friends our whole lives. It's almost like my little sister is getting married. EEEEP! I&nbsp;should ask my girfriend(yes, I&nbsp;also have a girlfriend)&nbsp;if she wants to go with me.

Hm, nothing much else is going on. I'm almost 20. My teen years are on the countdown!! 

Anyway, I'll try to log back on again soon enough. I&nbsp;need to change my profile picture. Look me up on facebook!"

"event","<p>Hey everyone! What's up? It's been crazy for me lately. I&nbsp;currently don't have a job but hopefully that'll change very soon. I&nbsp;was making plans with a &quot;friend&quot;&nbsp;of mine about moving up to Chicago and living and working up there then come back in Jan. But nope! This person said that they didn't want me as a roommate. <br /><br />So, if you live up in Chicago and want a roommate, lemme know please! Or up in Boston, Mass or surrounding areas. ((PLEASE! I really need to get out of Rhode Island.)<br /><br />But anyway, what else is going on?&nbsp;Hmm, I'm going by male pronouns now and I&nbsp;have a &quot;girlfriend&quot;&nbsp;in a sense. I&nbsp;guess. Not sure what we are at the moment. <br /><br />That's basically my life at the moment. Besides fighting with my ma, there isn't much more.

Lay down;

1) I started dating a best friend of mine; we broke up; we're no longer friends.

2) I'm starting CCRI this Fall...I think...?

3) I started talking to another ex of mine. Which is good.

4) I just got home from a short visit to Chicago. Ran into a few people I know. Got a tattoo."

I'm not going to list my whole life story to you. That's idiotic. Here's a basic lay down.

1) I've been called ""Sir"" so many times, I've lost count. Even at work.

2) When I was in Boston, I used the men's room because it felt right to me. I didn't get attacked and (hopefully) no one noticed that I'm a bio-female.

3) I had the chance to talk to a really great friend of mine. Missed him loads.

4) Couldn't find MTPC for the life of me.

5) Funny story: My ex has a new gf barely 2 months after we broke up and has completely fallen in love with her. (Jaime's on the phone: ""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"" in a crazy Dominican way.). I agree with him.

But anyway, to end this painful blog quickly, one last word of wisdom: People are psycho if they tell you they love you after one week. Run...away...NOW."

"event","Hey again! I'm just sitting and relaxing at my laptop before going to my&nbsp;friend's house. We have plans of heading up to Thayer St.&nbsp;on the East Side of Providence and just chillin up there. I'm getting&nbsp;my lip pierced at Rockstar Body Piercing. I'm hoping that Jay can do it. He's done all my&nbsp;piercings. I know today's the day to get it&nbsp;done. I can feel it in my nuggets!&nbsp; 

Another thing is, according to my ex, I'm emotionally fucked up.&nbsp;No, I just didn't love her anymore. I felt it in my nuggs that it was time to move on. I don't think I'm emotionally closed up or fucked up. I&nbsp;had no problem loving my other ex or loving my friends and choosen family. That's okay, life goes&nbsp;on, doesn't it? 

Right now, I'm just keeping clear of being in any kind of relationship other than&nbsp;random dating. I'm&nbsp;interested in this young lady named Brittney. Thing is, I've never dated&nbsp;someone whose fem or bisexual. So this should be an interesting.&nbsp;I've liked her for&nbsp;awhile, but I don't want to start anything because we both recently got out of a long-term relationship.&nbsp; 

A couple of weeks ago, I went to the&nbsp;club with my sister and our best friend and my sister's mom (I call her ma also,&nbsp;even though she's not), I have to say, it was&nbsp;an interesting night since I took&nbsp;3 straight women, 2 of whom&nbsp;never been to a&nbsp;club at all, to&nbsp;Dyke Night&nbsp;at&nbsp;Club Energy.&nbsp;After getting some what shitfaced,&nbsp;we all went to IHop at&nbsp;2 am and enjoyed a nice breakfast. I never knew hashbrowns could taste so&nbsp;good after so many beers and shots.&nbsp; 

Another interesting thing,&nbsp;on Easter Sunday while I was at work, there was a stabbing in the apartment building across the parking lot from&nbsp;me. I have to say, it's quite spooky. In the neighborhood&nbsp;I live in, the worst that has ever happened here are&nbsp;random drug busts. But what can you do? Violence is everywhere, so matter where you go. 

To end this quickly, I have to say this.....Damn, is it just me, or is the taste of freedom really this sweet and delicious? Like a mango smoothie."

"event","Hey everyone! It's time for an update.

So, this past Halloween I had to work a 6 hour shift at Shaws and I didn't get home till a little&nbsp;after 9.&nbsp;Already my Halloween had started off bad (not only that, but I also had to go to class that day). But anyway, after I got home from working at FABULOUS Shaws&nbsp;(rolls eyes), I put on a fire hair looking wig and headed out to my friends. I have to say, I think that was the highlight of our Halloween. Just us being together. Because after that, my bffl ""J"" got a raw egg thrown at her and my bffl ""C"" got called a fag because he dressed as a woman.

And we didn't get that much candy either! ::sob:: That's okay. I bought a 3 pound bag for less then 3 bucks at Shaws. W00T."

Until the time is through

I cant believe it
I dont know where to start no baby
So many questions
Deep inside my heart

Bridge:
Give me a moment before you go
Theres something you ought to know

Chorus:
Baby now and forever
Until the time is through
Ill be standing here
Waiting and never give up my faith in you
Trying to make it clear
Without your love Id be half a man
Maybe one day youll understand
Now and forever
Until the time is through

Ill be waiting...

How can I tell you so that you can see
Love has a meaning
When you are here with me
(when you are here with me, baby)

(bridge)

(chorus)

There is no one to comfort me
Here in my cold reality
Im searching for words
What can I say to make you see? 

Baby now, until time is through, Ill be here girl (2x)

Her bus back to Chicago was at 11:45p est and my last bus home was at 10:53p est.&nbsp;<br /><br />I must say, the departure was heart breaking. I felt really guilty about leaving her in Kennedy Plaza (KP) by herself crying because she didn't want to leave. She's coming back on Oct. 16th and I can't fucking wait! It pisses me off that I couldn't hold her till she stopped crying.&nbsp;</p>"

I'm working my ass off at both school and at work while trying to finish cleaning my apt for when my girl comes down to RI from Chicago. Everything seems really off-balance..just...crazy ya know? During my breaks at Shaws (which is onlt 15/20 minutes) I've been sitting outside eating a milk chocolate Hershey bars and a bottle of Coke while takinga&nbsp; drag of a smoke...or two or three. Depending on how fast I smoke em... Mah Nat (which is weird, because I work with a Natalie also) doesn't like me eating unhealthy during my break. So, while she's down here and I'm at work, during my break she's gonna break me real food (I'm still gunna eat a candy bar and have a soda. Because I'm mad dope like that)....so yeah...I'M A COKE ADDICT.</p>"

Well, it was way too late for me to do classes at CCRI, so now I'm repeating my senior year of high school. It's like...WTF. Pisses me off.&nbsp;

On top of that, I start my new job at Shaws in East Providence tomorrow. I'm only going to be making $7.55 an hour. Minimun wage in RI is $7.40. So...15 cents more...grrr and I'm only working part time.&nbsp;I'm seriously hoping I can get a pay raise soon. Like..to&nbsp;$8 bucks.&nbsp;Yeah, wishfull thinking, I know. It'll cost me a&nbsp;little over an hours pay to&nbsp;buy a pay of cloves.&nbsp;

I know! I KNOW! I SHOULD QUIT.&nbsp;My girlfriend already got on my case about my ""chain smoking."" I'm not a ""chain smoker."" I just...smoke...a lot. Like...a pack in two days. Well, I had 14 or 15 yesterday....I still have almost a whole pack of Pall Mall to finish once I've finish my Cloves. Damnit. I should cut back. I already cut back a little on drinking...I use to get drunk 3 or 4 times a week. Now it's like...2&nbsp;times a week. Hmmm...

I love love love love love that I can talk to Bubser for 5 minutes and she never makes me feel like I'm dumping too much on her and on a good day for both of us there's more ims consisting of woeiutoihretgiet than anything esle
I wish I knew how to tell someone that I don't want to be friends with them. Because they irritate me. And I can't stand someone else being an alpha female around me maybe lilbit. But mostly because they irritate me.
I like working in the office because no one pays attention to me unless I want them to
I like talking to Linda at work whose husband needs a new lung and whose daughter's husband died. She smiles a lot more earnestly and says shit with a lot more meaning than most people I know.
I can't wait for my sister's wedding just for the sheer oddity it will entail. Between the people and the actual ceremony and the liquor, I wonder how I'll be able to sleep the night before
I wonder if anybody thinks about me as much as I think about them. Because I think a lot. 
I might give you 5 minutes of unedited thoughts if I could have five of yours in return.
I am thankful that parents had a big family because I pretty much hate being home alone
I am thankful that later in life Alanna and I learned to not only get along but see each other as allies in the fight against weinerism
It makes me sad to think of why we got closer and why I pulled away from Aislinn
I hate it when people describe colossal pains in the ass as 'bipolar' because they aren't bipolar, they're just annoying.
Holding Logan made every thing I worry about go away for a few minutes the other day.
I hope I don't end up having a job with filing later in life because it's annoying to do all day
Shredding at work seems cooler and more important if you imagine that there are shredded things that the company is hiding. Paper-shredders have been history-makers lately and maybe I am too
I think maybe it's good for me that for once I am not getting what I want. Like I needed it or something. Because I used to always, somehow get it. Even in high school when I screwed myself over.
Maybe I'll get it in the end
I'm always thinking I'll get it in the end."

"event","There was an episode of Third Watch like...10 years ago where Hope or Faith or whatever christianity-based name she was said she wasn't sure whether a decision she made was bad or good, and she thinks it, like all decisions, was probably a little bit of both.
  As I drove through my town this evening I realized that for the first time since 2001, I would not be going to prom.
  I'm not really upset by this. Although prom= really good potatoes.
  Sometimes I think that I was wired really oddly by whatever genetic crossovers made me. I feel like I have so much ""gift"" and brain and different ways of seeing things...but on any day so much thought is devoted to the petty and for so much of my life the ""gift"" is wasted on boys, and now men. 
  I would say wasted is the right word. For I've made decisions with little thought and much thought and I've yet to see much difference between the two.
  I re-read his text messages. All the way back to a nice one from April 12. 
  Picturing people who are so close to real life/adulthood as tender, vulnerable, gawky adolescent versions of themselves is endearing. We don't give our old friends that luxury. Maybe it's not a luxury. Maybe it's a favor to our oldest friends that we do not wish to remember them at their most awkward times.
  I'm a nostalgiaholic. I could look through boxes of family photos til I'm blue in the face...and then I'd probably turn on the old family videos before gulping for air.
  How much of who we are is shaped by our family? At times I see so much of myself in these people I came from, and at other times I wonder where I got the notion that to think so differently from them would be alright. I wonder why other people can't do this, can't see things from different angles than the ones they're given as babies.
  I like being the new go-to girl for student films and music videos...all that theater training put to good use (?)
  It's mother's day sunday, and as always, I will not tell my mom what I think of her (because it's good things) and once again I will curse not writing to oprah about her."

"event","I've had a brief affair with myspace blogger, i must admit. But alas, the publicity of said blog and the general reluctance I feel towards placing real emotions there has led me back to you dear livejournal.
  So I'm stuck. Like, way stuck. Between a rock and a place I've been before but not really been before because it's a different person. But i've reached this conclusion-- Me dealing with real issues in life: mostly rational, at least in thought. Me dealing with guys: irresponsible. When I'm single I am a a loose cannon, part by choice and part by best friendual enabling. I truly enjoy my life, the endorphin high I get when I'm putting on makeup and dancing around at 9 pm on a Friday night. I enjoy the power I feel as a single, blonde, 19-year old. The feeling that anybody i talk to might be the love of my life. I truly cherish the fact that after the muck of 3 relationships, I can have a civil, intense, worthwhile conversation with each of my major exes. but there are some weeks when I've been out too much and I'm nursing a post-6 PM hangover and i see girls in sweats, with snacks, getting ready for a night of futon cuddling etc with their bfs.And then I get this pang, because there's some yearning for constancy in my life after all. 
 Being single is never really the rule for me, rather the rarity. and I see this spell being a long one. But I've reached a point where I think I need to be single. I know that after a month of it, I cry a whole lot less than when I am coupled (I'm sure that means something). Because when it comes down to it, it is hard enough to live your life to your own standards at age 19, never mind the standards someone else has for life. 
 Lately I've been frustrated by double standards. Just the traditional virgin/whore complex, guy rules and girl rules, and I guess society in general. I don't want to be the domestic type and I don't want to be the intimidating wild girl. I just want to be somebody's Sofia Serrano and be magic and witty and sexy and the greatest thing you've ever seen all at once. I like to think I'm captivating but people are blinded by certain aspects of me whether I like it or not. 
 And when I find someone who has these good qualities, the right taste in music, the right humor, the right height, they also have one of my least favorite qualities, like, ever. But I think he likes me. And I can't stop thinking about him."

  Saturday was awesome because I didn't have to work. So I sat at home in my underwear and made a skirt out of a horrendous t shirt...wish I could put pictures up. Went and saw my dog at work (for serious she may be here before the end of the week...a boxer baby ) then had dinner with Neil where we were outclassed by pretty much everyone except for our waitress who hit on both of us? On to blockbuster, our usual saturday night jaunt, where random guy on line behind us commented on a faint design still on my skirt from the t shirt...this design happened to sit precariously near my ass...what a fag...nice being held time with the senor...can't wait to spend hours like that at school
  Sunday I spent mostly in my underwear again, making a new shirt and having tree service guys hit on me...i must be really really fertile this weekend or something because everyone and their father seems to want my sweet, still un-tanned irish ass. I guess that's cool.

  I'd been feeling really great about my body lately until Saturday morning when I woke up with a belly full of alcohol and half-digested diner sandwich. Bathroom scales are not love. Memory foam is love. Forehead kisses are love. I am mad at my body for somehow exploding in the space of one weekend, but I have to give it props for keeping it where I wanted it to be until Friday night, aka close-encounters-of-the-myspace-haters-kind-night. That was good, 'cept for the chunk missing from my front tooth courtesy of a well-trained OakCrest Day Camp staffer tossing me in 3 feet of water. FACEPLANT! But mostly a successful weekend. I have to ponder what made me hate girls in high school and decide whether it was because I hadn't stumbled upon the right ones. Then I stop and think and remember that I still hate 90% of females so who knows.
  I want an electric bass for my birthday. I have too much pride in my non-female characteristics to drop hints to the boy. It would be way cool if he figured it out on his own though. Because I don't feel like buying one for myself.
  I feel exhausted, but happy.
  My week is riddled with appointments. Next weekend I'm going to sleep, eat, and read. Your ass is mine if you disturb this ritual of mine. (If you're Devon DeMarco then maybe I'll allow it)
 I was asked to pinpoint what makes me start to feel sad or worried or angry and I hate that it's mostly future/school/responsibilities. There is no secret.
 This is longer than it needed to be. Godspeed."

"event","You can take what they ask you to take. Twice daily, once nightly, with food, with water, with nothing. You can feel better for a while. You can be lulled into feeling a sense of peace and calm and ""finally"". But all it takes is one rainy lonely day to send you hurtling backwards into the oblivion you had almost forgotten about. It's daunting to think that you'll always be only one sad book, one sad song, one bad conversation away from losing the ground you'd worked so hard to gain. You can act like you've regained control of your emotions, your ""moods"", your whatever, but when it comes down to it, body chemistry will always be ready to punch you in the stomach. Especially when you're a girl.
      Weekends start out full of promise and sunlight and end up locked in a bathroom during a family dinner, dreading the funny looks you'll get for how puffy and red your face became in your departure. You want so badly to make human contact, to be held, but an accidental arm brush makes you shrink away so fast it's noticeable. And that's the last thing you want. 
     You wonder who, if anyone, knows how it feels when you get like this. If anyone could really empathize because you know you're crazy too. You wonder if it will ever get better. When it's rainy like this you think it won't. When you had a good day and a good song is playing, you'll never have a bad day again and anyone who speaks against you is an idiot and furthermore you don't really care about what they have to say anyhow. On these days it's the opposite. Every word, every inflection, carries a weight that probably only you can hear. Days like this make you hear that extra whisper in someone's goodbye that makes the absent ""i love you"" burn into your head. The accidental ignorings and oversights of your being are enough to send you into hysterics. You eat too fast because you want to fill up the gaping maw of a hole that you feel inside yourself. 
     You just want it to be okay, for once, for a week at a time. But you're beginning to think that's impossible."

"event","In all the excitement and hubbub over Aislinn's year-away nuptials, I have decided that becoming a wedding planner would be a truly excellent job. Everything I read about people who are planners extraordinaire sounds like a perfect job for me. I think I would have to be the idea person though and I should probably have an assistant who does organizing stuff? I hate organizing. I need to work in a few more random jobs...I already have flower design and sales under my belt...and a nice art background. Sounds like a good idea.
    The postal service sounds like magic when you listen to it out of context and it also sounds like first semester and beginnings and that awful hesitation where you're really just someone's hookup partner and you want more. I guess it sounds more like you KNOW this could go somewhere, just one of you has to say the word and make it official, cuz, you know, you sleep there all the time anyway.

"event","Ah, so here we are, in another abandoned blog of mine...I can't seem to keep these deals up but I guess I'll try. I'm supposed to be writing my thoughts down anyway for professional purposes so I guess I could do it here and then make some entries private.
 Just like last summer I'm tired all the time...I've pretty much lost contact with almost anyone I considered important at this time last year...more their choice than my own, but we all make choices and act in ways that affect us in the long run. That was one of the gayest sentences I've ever written, I apologize. 
 But in all seriousness I can't help but marvel at the nature of my friendships...why it's hard for me to hold onto people or vice versa...and I have to wonder if it isn't the same for most people. Once you've physically LIVED with a group of people for a year, will any other friendships have so much common ground? Or a better question might be could anyone who hasn't had to interview a Liberian understand me on the same scale that about half of my school friends do? 
 On the other hand, on Friday I went driving with Kallman for about three hours and had really deep conversations about high school love and friends and the fluidity of both and it made me feel really amazing and smart and even beautiful on a night that I felt really really bad. Also I found out White Castle makes little cups of cheese for your fries (!) so that was amazing too.
 I don't really feel like reflecting back on the past 3 months because they've been hard and private for the most part. All I can say is that I hope that the whole ""darkest night is before the dawn"" thing is true and that the dawn is coming really soon."

"event","So today I was awoken at various intervals by a paper-writing boyfriend. That I have no qualm with, though it is disconcerting to be covered with kisses at 5:30 am and not really know what's going on. Anyway. By the time 10:30 rolled around, I had pissed him off (quite hypocritically too) and found out that 2 weeks shy of moving out, my lack of responsibility cost me $50 for a lock change.
  My brain was full when I went to sleep last night and not the good full that Ariel and I talked about the other day...swimming full...the  bad kind. Though yesterday as a whole was a good day, just stupid GPA/scholarship worries like usual.
  I think next semester is going to be different, but it probably won't.
  I think I'll still think I'm going crazy all the time.
  I think I should stop being so fucking emo."

"event","Ahh on this eve of easter all I can think about is a family that I grew up with. I guess it makes sense...they were very ingrained in the church I grew up in and especially the music ministry which is where I ""served"" for so long (the irony and hypopcrisy of me being a religious music leader is not lost on me but that's another long boring entry). 
  So they had a whole lot of kids, I want to say 11 but sadly I can't even recall at this point and I am pissed at myself for being that neglectful because I was really close with them at one point. The family was one of the strictest Catholic ones I've seen, and believe me, I've seen a few
  Their eldest daughter got pregnant when she was a junior in college. Despite less than intense feelings for the father and no solid income she kept the baby. It had many problems  not limited to shaken baby sydrome...the cause of which was never actually determined. Now one of their other daughters is doing most of the child-rearing for said baby as the mother and her boyfriend do...I don't know what.
  The second eldest now has sex with her boyfriend with no protection. Ever. Ya know, cause it's against the church's wishes. Just like abortion. Because one daughter already got pregnant, she can't possibly!
  Can I get a collective ""WAKE THE FUCK UP!!""?
  Catholicism...any organized religion with outdated dictums and misinterpretations...they just piss me off to no end. You can't possibly live your life to said contraints, so don't pick idiotic things to follow!
  I remember my mom talking about the baby in that situation and the mom and how careless she was and saying ""At least she didn't have an abortion...""
  And yet now the baby has problems, the daughter who has to care for it is never happy...it brought so much pain and suffering to said family. I don't think that you should just treat abortion as a birth control method--obviously use condoms or go on the pill or do anything but pull out as a method, but in some scenarios, very little good is going to develop.
  Before I started having sex I was pro-life. I don't see how you can stay pro-life when you're sexually active...I admire people who manage to do, but if your life, your relationship, your family, your everything is not in order, a baby is not going to magically cure it all.
  Religion is alright, in small doses, but watching it pervert and cause so much pain makes me resent it...



bahhh

"event","So today as I took the hottest shower of my life after teaching swim lessons and walking back from Packer in the freezing rain, my thoughts turned to love. As usual.



BLAHI'MEMOI'MEMOI'MEMO

sorry. 

Anyway, for serious, I was thinking about past love, etc, because soap and hot water smell good and so does love. And I was shaving my legs which I do more frequently when I'm in love.

I thought about a person I had loved, wholeheartedly, for more of my life than I'd like to admit. I had thought about this person a few days ago just because some random sunny memory floated into my head...making salad in my kitchen when I was 15 or something...Fifteen! A baby! I had loved him when I was that little and I didn't really grow up until I stopped loving him two years later.

Amanda from t4 talked to me about how you never really get over your first love. I did. It took forever and being fucked over and being cursed at and seeing that there are better things, but eventually I did.

And now I'm here and I can't imagine how he ever loved me or how I ever loved him. Granted, there's always a connection when we speak but it's in such a hands-off 'wow-you-really-fucked-up' way. And for a while I believed that I was the one who did that, who pushed it to the point of no return. Maybe I did, but if I did it's because I was too stupid to see that things were wrong.

That's what it comes down to. First loves generally happen when you're young. Young equals stupid. Life generally has to spit in your face a few times before you get the hang of things. It's unfortunate, but true. 

The boy now wonders how I can be so okay with things, so civil, to someone who put me through so much. I chalk that up to being older too...you realize that even though someone fucked you up so much, you wrote some damn good things out of your sadness and you learned what NEVER to do again. That, he agreed with.

So in the end, we're all fucked up or still hung up on our first loves...I just can't decide whether or not it's sad that something that once held so much promise and so much emotion now means literally nothing to me except for its influence on my current life.

Tonight Michael asked me if giving head hurts your jaw...I responded by lowering the seat of the Mercedes into his feeble knees...it's weird how he and Goose interact with me in kinda similar ways but are such very different people...except for the jewishness of course. Apparently I'm in love with ellipses...they are awesome.
  This morning I woke up early by accident and went running and it was beautiful out and an old man in an Irish fisherman cap said good morning to me while he got his paper. I got locked out but I was still in a good mood. I think everyone's lives would be better if that happened to them and the weather was always as nice as it was today.
  Also, I bought shoes.
  Also, I got my hair cut
  Also, I had a very weinery st. patrick's day meal. Delicious though.
  This was the first spring break I can remember that didn't suck...but I miss TCNJers too...life is good when you wake up next to someone every morning and can just go back to sleep happy. And safe.

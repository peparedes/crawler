"event","Star Trek: Miasma, Greg Cox. 

Hardly counts; more a diversion than literature, but comforting and familiar, like Grandma's mashed potatoes. In this one, Spock's blood is the only defense for a stranded away team on a foggy world full of giant, carnivorous leeches. Unlike Michener's Alska, mentioned in the last post, picking at this one during the occasional free moment between (or during other books) was no great challenge. There's no complex narrative thread to lose hold of...

Speaking of Alaska, I was surprised by the arrival of Star Trek: Elusive Salvation, a hot-off-the-presses forgotten pre-order. Set in the Arctic Circle c. 1845, San Francisco c. 2283 and New York c. 1970, it, too, was a purchase made when our own Artic adventure was imminent.  That part of its appeal no longer applies, of course. But I do like my mashed potatoes...."

Gripping.&nbsp; Great sentences.&nbsp; Grab the dictionary before reading for the occassional archaic term.&nbsp; 5 stars.

Am behind on my count because I started James Michener&#39;s Alaska - also engaging, like a good anthropology class- and got to the Russians&#39; arrival before putting it down (not actually moving to Alaska has dampened my interests in its history).&nbsp; I haven&#39;t met any recurring characters so can pick it up without too much trouble if I care to down the road.

Now on How to Talk Minnesotan by Howard Mohr (revised for the 21st Century).&nbsp; Thanks, Chaddy, for the original.&nbsp; &nbsp;"

Another delayed finish...started this months ago, but I guess the winter (such as it has been), not being conducive to commuting on foot, has seen a decrease in audio book consumption. But: Morality was powerful (and as a bonus: featured Queens), and the last one, Summer Thunder, which I just finished in a post-Poconos bath, was great straight-up sci fi."

"event","Lathe of Heaven by Ursula K Le Guin. Amazing. Trippy. Transcendent. Michale Chabon says on the cover that he read it as a child and got so much more the second time around. So, into the book-you-should-have-read-in-school category it goes. Tonight, the British film version, courtesy of YouTube (and next week the DVD of the made-for-tv American remake with James Caan. Definitely will be re-reading someday soon. 

Next is the Michael Chabon's book-I've-been-meaning-to-read (it's been on my Kindle for years), Yiddish Policemen's Union. Set in Alaska, it's apropos for the day after Tj's epic convo with Kotzebue. (He's got the audio version in the car right now.)

<![endif]--></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Last night I finished <i>In the Heart of the Sea: the Tragedy of the Whaleship </i>Essex by Nathaniel Philbrick.&nbsp; It was published in 2000 but is based on several firsthand narratives of the sinking and subsequent travails of the crew of Nantucket&#39;s <i>Essex </i>in the 1820s.&nbsp; Although non-fiction, it was adapted by Melville for <i>Moby Dick </i>several decades later.

I enjoyed the book, but then again I like everything about the sea...it was because of the 1,500+ piece Maersk cargo ship model that I got back into Lego, and my favorite vacations are cruises.&nbsp; If I hit the jackpot tomorrow, the first thing I&#39;m doing is buying a yacht (well, maybe I&#39;ll hire the seamen first).&nbsp; Attached is a pic of what looks like a group of jaunty boys frolicking on deck...it&#39;s actually a screen shot (yay, Kindle!) of one of the illustrations from <i>Heart of the Sea </i>meant to convey the hardships of long ocean voyages (it&#39;s not giving away too much to say that cannibalism is a plot point).&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the movie version got great reviews, but I&rsquo;m still excited to see it.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">  </span>(Although it was last year and won&rsquo;t count for this challenge, as a sort of inoculation against spoilers I read the novelization of <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Force Awakens</i> before seeing the film.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">  </span>Alas, these reverse adaptations don&rsquo;t work very well and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend the &ldquo;book.&rdquo;)<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">  </span>By the way, what the hell is &#39;salt junk&#39;??

My quandary:&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure what category of the reading challenge this book falls in.&nbsp; Closest I can manage is &#39;book previously abandoned&#39; because I actually stated it last year.&nbsp; But, it was December of last year, and it&#39;s only January now!&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like saying I &quot;abandon&quot; work every evening when I go home.&nbsp; Anyway, suggestions appreciated.

For my next book, I was going to read a recent translation of <i>Madame Bovary, </i>about an adulterous doctor&#39;s wife, as my &#39;book previously banned&#39; (because of how tawdry it was for the time) but I didn&#39;t feel like schlepping a hardcover with me today (incidentally, it&#39;s #9 on this list of David Bowie&#39;s favorite books: http://www.nypl.org/blog/2016/01/11/david-bowies-top-100-books?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=referral).&nbsp; Luckily, Tj came back from a weekend visit to Oregon just last night and as a souvenir brought me back <i>The Lathe of Heaven</i> by Ursual K. Le Guin from Portland&#39;s famous bookstore, Powell&#39;s. &nbsp; The endorsement on the front cover is a blurb by Michael Chabon (author of <i>Yiddish Policemen&#39;s Union</i> and <i>Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i>, among others), also introduced to me by Tj.&nbsp; This one will be my &#39;book chosen by spouse.&#39;

Speaking of books, George R.R. Martin announced on his blog that the final installment of the Games of Thrones series would be delayed, resulting in the unusual phenomena of the television version actually preceding the source material.&nbsp; His platform?&nbsp; None other than LiveJournal.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/norightturn/170772/6092/6092_900.jpg"" title="""" />

"event","My friend took a cue, and now I&#39;m taking hers. &nbsp;I don&#39;t have much to say so I&#39;ll just give a rundown of my day.

Arrived at work early today, in anticipation of staff who might have allotted too much extra travel time and got stuck shivering outside of the building. &nbsp;Did not walk - though the new mayor seems to have the streets taken care of, for a pedestrian commuter like me, it&#39;s the sidewalks that are a problem. &nbsp;And the trains weren&#39;t awful, despite the dire prognostications. &nbsp;The R came, as always, and while the 7 swayed some, it got me to where I needed to go. &nbsp;(I also walked to work yesterday, not because of weather, but due to the inordinate burden of pounds and pounds of references and other resources received during an off-site training last Friday, before I went on break, that I was transporting to the office). &nbsp;It&#39;s very quiet so far - our one actual teaching-related obligation was cancelled - so I did some shoveling until maintenance crews arrived.

Lorry is home with the baby...DOE cancelled school early this morning, to the delight of many employees who spent an anxious night awaiting the news (and to the consternation of many parents, I imagine). &nbsp;A funny tweet from the new first family resulted from a potentially embarrassing public exchange between son Dante and his friends...supposedly he replied &quot;I&#39;ll ask my dad&quot; in response to a question about school closures (there are already obvious implications being strewn about, and it&#39;ll be interesting to see this administration unfolds, the first in a long time - ever?- with a child of the chief executive attending one of the City&#39;s public schools...certainly there&#39;s no precedent for for one in which a mayor&#39;s son had such readily available access to the public and who, in turn, could so readily scrutinize him through the same cyber lens.). &nbsp;Anyway, his mother posted a photo of a shovel with the caption, &quot;What Dante will be doing tomorrow if school is cancelled.&quot; &nbsp;(Two tangential thoughts: I wonder what the Sanitation commissioner, a temporary hold-over from Bloomberg, must be feeling. &nbsp;He&#39;s the fall guy if anything goes wrong in the storm response, but knows he only has a job because a new appointment hasn&#39;t been made. &nbsp;And, still no word on the Parks commish.)

TJ is home right now...his new rotation is markedly less stressful than the last, in the ICU. &nbsp;Seems there&#39;s little to do in surgery unless and actual surgery is happening. &nbsp;He had an unprecedented string of days off over the holiday, happily coinciding with mine, and only has afternoon obligations today &nbsp;- &nbsp;which he may not even go to, depending on road conditions later on. &nbsp;We were debating a visit to his grandmother&#39;s on the Shore this weekend, but realized we signed up for tickets to an &quot;inaugural open house&quot; at Gracie Mansion this Sunday. &nbsp;He may go on without me and return in time for the event, or I might just go on my own.

Ran across this <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/opinion/in-praise-of-offline-slow-reading.html?src=rechp"">article </a>over my morning coffee and it made me grateful that I thought to bring my book to read during what will surely be a slow day: &nbsp;Hangsaman, by Shirley Jackson (recently released by Penguin Classics). &nbsp;It&#39;s very good so far and I highly recommend it. &nbsp;(Thanks to Erin P. for letting me onto her Amazon Prime account, and allowing me to cash in on all that free shipping.) &nbsp;In addition to devoting more time to immersive reading, I&#39;m also resolving this year to rekindle friendships (the honeymoon is over), and to stick with the digital sabbaths I&#39;ve occasionally experimented with (the goal is no Internet from Friday night to Saturday night). &nbsp;

"event","It finally occurred to me why the radio streaming app I listen to on my walk to work would conk out on me every now and then. &nbsp;First, I deduced a pattern of occurrences, and initially ascribed those occasions to the the L.I.E. overpass which, I surmised, temporarily interfered with my reception. &nbsp;Upon closer examination of my phone I realized that I was actually picking up a weak wifi signal from something called Miller&#39;s Ale House, where I had eaten once, and whose network I had apparently used. &nbsp;As it happens, the internet service they provide customers is no better their food, and my interruption was caused by the switch from 3G, and back again, while moving through the restaurant&#39;s vicinity. &nbsp; &nbsp;  

I have a lot of time to think on my walk, and this is what I think about. &nbsp;"

"event","<p>Gorgeous day for celebrating Garden Month and Poetry Month in New York. As part of the judging triad for Parks' ""Garden of the Month"" competition I get to explore horticultural wonders in all five boroughs, dressed in their seasonal best. Today marked the start of the 2013 season and the Bronx site happened to be Joyce Kilmer Park - his famous 'Trees' (I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree) was my Earth Day tweet - and appropriately enough, it featured a magnificent sculpture honoring Heinrich Heine, a German poet. The statue, whose details I hope can be discerned from the accompanying photos (note the hapless sailor's skull!), is a magnificent allusion to the 'Die Lorelei', or sirens, eponymous subject of his most famous work.  An interesting aside: because he converted from Judaism, it took some doing, and significant financial support from the local German community, to finally get the statue placed in New York. </p><p>Also including a pic of some tulips from the surrounding flower bed because they're just too fabulous not to share!  <br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/norightturn/170772/4860/4860_original.jpg""></p><p></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/norightturn/170772/5009/5009_original.jpg""></p><p></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/norightturn/170772/5253/5253_original.jpg""></p><p></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/norightturn/170772/5483/5483_original.jpg""></p><p></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/norightturn/170772/5709/5709_original.jpg""></p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

unburdened by a coat,
the smell of front lawns infiltrate,
and words need juggling
like keys you no longer have
enough pockets for.

When wives tug trash cans back inside
because husbands are away,
or don&#39;t care,
the ordinary,
unfamiliar smell of houses
fills me like the strangeness of a friend&#39;s place
I was taken&nbsp;to play in,
made all the stranger

If I ever write a book, I'd work very, very hard on a first sentence.  I often hear of works referred to by their first lines, and I figure, even if the rest of it sucks, my book can be recognized for that reason (plus, I'm much more liable to generate a successful sentence rather than entire book).  I'm toying with ""Don't call me Igor.""

As I was reading some Philip K. Dick last night I started wondering about space travel, and I came up with a theory:  society is in (and has been for approx. the last 100 years) a colonization lull.  This causes restiveness which manifests itself in war.  This is an extremely unscientific theory, as I am unschooled in history, warfare, or sociology.  But, it seems to (roughly) explain the little I do know.  Most of the conquest of the New World and Africa took place prior to the 20th Century.  The 20th Century was extremely bloody.  Is this accurate?  Dunno.  Did most exploration end by 1900?  Were previous centuries less/more/as bloody?  Dunno.  I figure if European colonization of the Americas started at around 1600, then yes, for all intensive purposes the continent was carved up by the modern area.  And between 2 world wars, the Cold War and the onset of the Era of Bush, the last one was a pretty intense century.  Yes, we don't often come by anything that remotely resembles the Inquisition or anything like that (plus, I saw Apacalypto...if Mel Gibson's right, there was some serious shit going on way before us), but nothing on the global scale we've experienced in recent decades.  Anyway, if it holds water, the predictive part of my theory states that once we start colonizing the rest of the solar system, we should experience more peace at home due to the common ""Human"" goal.

"event","A very minor matter, and one that I wouldn't normally be concerned with (and wish I wasn't this time).  But, it's nagging at me slightly over the last day or so, and I thought some outsider perspective might prove helpful.

Last week I go out with a fellow.  I happened to have a spare ticket to an event which I acquired the day before it was for, the same day I happened to make the aquaintance of this guy through an online personals ad.  He seemed keen on going with me, so, while it was unusually hasty, our first date occurred just one day after we first started corresponding (that was Thursday).  We had a nice time, and saw each other again on Sunday (another nice date, or so I thought).

Now it's Wednesday, and like I said, my concern may be entirely over-exaggerated and insubstantial, but here's where it stems from:  as we departed from that second date, he casually mentions a possible dinner during the week, and promises to call on Monday.  That doesn't happen.  A phone message I left yesterday suggesting an evening activity tonight was un-returned.  Should I be worried?

He's in design, and the City is in high gear for Fashion Week, so busy-ness might be an impediment.  Plus, technically, it's not like days and days have gone by without contact, and when you factor in the fact that two outings in less than the space of week is above average for a new fling, it's very possible that this is standard and healthy just-started-dating-someone distance being imposed.

I'm not hung up on this guy, but would love to hear some thoughts on what's happening.  It could be nothing, but I've done my fair share of ""forgetting"" to call when I knew things weren't meant to be with particular person, so I'm familiar with the signs."

1. Are you named after anyone? If so, explain.
My maternal grandmother's sister was named Ida.

2. Do you have your children's names picked out already? If so, is there any significance?
Forrest and Jenny, although the significance is not (solely) movie related.  Forrest for the obvious reasons, Jenny in honor of said grandma.  While ""Zelda"" was somehow arrived at as her legal English name, the closest transliteration of the original Russian is ""Djzhenia.""

3. If you were born a member of the opposite sex what would your name have been?
Not sure, but interesting story about my sister:  she was expected to be a boy, and Larry was chosen.  The spelling was barely changed, though, and hence her name means ""English truck.""

4. If you could re-name yourself what name would you pick and why?
Been there, done that.  My becoming a citizen at 6 provided a rare window of opportunity to legally change my name.  It was ""Americanized"" to Gary, with my original first name bumped into the middle name slot.  Suppose it was because Dif'rent Strokes was so popular at the time...

It happened on my street...I've narrowed down the probable place of occurance to a stretch between two stores - one of which I remember handling them last, the next where I realized they weren't on my person anymore.  I scoured the sidewalk of the block, as well as asked at the two places if any had been turned in.  I suppose I could put up signs around the neighborhood, but it might be too late.

All in all not a total loss - my insurance covered some of the intial cost, and I did get a good half a year's use out of them.  But they were very fashionable - Calvin Klein frames - and I got a lot of compliments about them.

"event","For those of you that don't know, I've recently been approved to begin work at another division of the Parks Dept.  I'll be leaving the Rangers, just two months shy of being awarded my 5 year pin.  My new work will be in the office of community relations at the agency's main headquarters, the Arsenal building in Central Park.  I'll be working directly for a woman who's basically the Parks Dept.'s social secretary and indirectly for the assistant commissioner for city-wide services, a man who I had worked for in my prior post as well, but now am closer to due to the removal of about 10 levels of the chain of command and incalculable reams of red tape.  I'll be in the same suite of offices as Kevin Jeffrey, the deputy commissioner for public programs, and just down the hall from the big man himself, Parks Commissioner Benepe.

Although I always loved being a ranger, I loved doing new things more.  My passion for exploring that particular world has been quelched, and now I must address my passion for all the variety that life has to offer.  I realize now that I will most likely never become an expert in any one field, but as long as the jobs I take are as intersting as they have been (trail guide, fondue maker, physics teacher, park ranger, officiant, and now, event planner) I will remain content.  In fact, I feel revitalized that I've succesfully made this move, proving the fact that you don't have to get stuck and exploration is always an option.  I've only began, I realized, to scratch the surface of everything I want to do in my life (personal chef, professional actor, theologian, etc).

I'm leaving the wonderful world of being a grown-up-boy-scout and curator of the the country's greatest living museum without any regrets, but not, alas, without some saddness and sense of nostalgia.  I had a great time and have done some pretty neat things: I've fished, rock climbed, backpacked, biked, birdwatched, canoed, ice skated and sledded.  I've met Rudy Guilliani, Donald Trump, James Earl Jones, Cynthia Nixon, Kitty Carlisle, Candace Bergen, etc.  I helped weigh the worlds largest ice cream cake at Union Sq. Park for Guiness, ushered in countless thousands of runners at Tavern on the Green during five consecutive NYC Marathons, marched in the St. Patrick's Day Parade, was in numerous news programs and print aricles for a variety of animal rescue related incidents, and had an audience with Christo and Jeanne-Claude on the eve of their project in the park.  I found out that penal law (sadly) isn't what I had pictured in my mind, and learned how to do the Georgia State take-down with a PR-24 baton.  Perhaps most importantly, I'll be forever grateful for the the chance I got to assist in recovery efforts at Ground Zero.

I want to thank those who've aided me along the way and put up with my rants and raves about city gov't.  I will miss most being able to drive you guys around in golf carts and pick-up trucks, let you into off-limit buildings to use bathrooms, lounge with you on the Sheep Meadow during lunchbreaks, dine al fresco on the terrace of the Castle after closing and take you on rambling tours of the Ramble. 

Now, time to shop for business casual!"

"event","My grandfather is 88 and has not been doing so well.  He's been in the hospital for a few days now, practically paralyzed on his entire right side after a recent stroke - the most recent of several, apparantly, that had gone undetected over the last several months.  He's unable to communicate much beyond simple yes or no answers, and that's when he's cognizant enough of the questions.  

My mom wistfully asked me during our visit today about avoiding old age.  I told her, of course, that it's inneviatable, but the trick to dealing with the demise is to make a difference while still young.  To bear death, live a meanigful life.  She said I seem to have cheated time by doing better than most staying young; at a recent family gathering I frequently was paid the compliment of not having aged at all in a good number of years.  My ""success"" is superficial.  My grandfather, on the other hand, was a veritable force of nature in his younger days (which is not too many ago).  When my grandmother died in '93, his own decline bagan.  Before that though he -and she, till the very end- shaped my like few other individuals can.  He is the last of 4 siblings that made a great family.  The oldest, the only daughter, died long before my time, but the three brothers founded branches of my family tree that still thrive today.  Indeed, that gathering was an example of a regular celebration of their legacy.  In this instance, the occassion was a wedding of a member representing the third generation since those World War I era boys were born.  One settled in Toronto.  He too died before I had much opportunity to get to know him, but tales of him taking his own life are still whispered.  My grandfather's other brother, a jovial fellow who I used to get a kick out of seeing the few times he'd come over from St. Paul because of the intense resemblance (as a child, with your entire world made up of so few, it's astounding to meet such a close match of an promiment player), died about 15 years ago in a roofing accident.  The matriarch of the clan was Dora, a woman I had the privelage and pleasure of knowing for many years.  She passed at well over 100, and still it was untimely.  My grandfather is the only child to have outlived her.

My grandfather won't be going back to live in his apartment; arrangements are being made for a nursing home.  I pray his suffering be minimal, and my mother's burden bearable."

"event","So, I got back from the Caribbean yesterday where I sailed to celebrate my cousin's marriage along with 50 other relatives/friends (and about 3,000 strangers, including crew).  The only other cruise I had ever been on was decades ago and so don't remember much about it.  Here are some interesting recollections about this one:

A boat in the middle of the open waters is my ideal vacation, I've come ot realize.  Especially a luxury liner - they wait on you hand and foot and you can do nothing for 24 hours a day is want.  The stuff there is to do they keep mindless enough so that you're still not really exerting too much energy.

You'll gain about 7 pounds a day sailing this way.  For a skinny guy like me it's a very acceptable part of the bargain.  There are about 7 full scale restaurants on board, room service, plenty of fast-food bars, two buffets...the options are pretty endless.  One night during the evening of the actuall wedding (which happened on St. Thomas in one of the oldest synagogues in the New World), we were served a 10 course meal.  I tell you, that's living.  The food did not stop being shovelled into our mouths.

The staff is super friendly.  Also very international.  Some one from a developing country can make enough on an 8 month tour to put on a down payment on a house upon their return.  But, they work 7 days a week (that's 8 months without a day off!!).  Pretty wacky, but I guess you do get to travel a lot and there are no expenses for you while you're there.  The casino and gift shops are the key jobs apparantly...at ports of call they must be closed acording to international law so those employees get extra time off.  Anyway, they are soooo nice to you there.  Our stateroom steward seemed to be on duty 24/7.  I had but to peek my head out of the cabin and he'd appear ready to help in whatever way i needed.  Everything was 'yes, Sir' and 'no, Sir.'  Even the senior doctor on the ship was as polite to me as the lowliest junior waiter.  We happened to run into him on the elevator as we were heading up to the night club on the last day.  He was very identifiable as a crew member beacuse they al have to wear their unforms even while off duty.  Beofre having read his name tag though and realizing his rank, we asked for a tour of the engine room, which we had been interested in seeing from day one (I went on a galley tour earlier in the week, but it left much to be desired).  Although he said it wasn't possible, he was extremely appologetic - said even most of the crew compliment can't go down there (actually, what caused a little chuckle was that he first asked if we were engineers ourselves).  The point is, even  my own doctor isn't as nice to me as he was!

Getting around was kinda tricky at first.  I'm not a natural navigator, so there was a lot of referring to the little ""you are here"" placards all over the place.  And asking for directions (which couldn't be simpler since no matter where you looked there was crew around - 1 to 2 crew/passenger ratio, I believe).  I still can't keep port and starboard straight, but eventually I got the hang of being able to tell if I was going forward or backwards on the boat by looking overborad and seeing the direction of the water moving.  I also realized that an additional ammenity they could add is moving sidewalks.  There were penty of elevator bays (the ship had over 20 stories) but is was moving along any one deck that gave you your exercise for the day.  And speaking of moving, the rocking takes about a day to get used to.  (Riding the NYC subways as practice beforehand helps).  When you get drunk, your stumbling kinda cancels out the ships motion). 

Getting drunk happened all the time.  I think I had a buzz going literally the entire time there, including sleep.  Drinks by the pool, wine tastings, cocktails with dinner, some sort of cray evening activity like a champage water fall or something, then rounds of shots at the dance club.  The whole things starts again in the morning.  My one uncle from Minnesotta runs a liquore store and brought a whole supply of alcohol with him.  He'd order pitchers and pitchers of juice with breakfast (it was included with our meals in the morning but cost extra throughout the rest of the day) and we'd have cranberry and vodka or screwdrivers till it ran out.  While laying and getting tan you might stir awake long enough to see a deck attendant delivering a tasty looking drink to someone...you'd order the same.  This went on and on.  On the beach of Tortola in the British Virgn Islands we drank some of the local beer.  Once on San Juan we went to some sort of chain restaurant called Senior Frogs (a spring break staple it seems) and had two foot high Long Island Iced Teas (a little taste of hime :-)

On the last full day we were supposed to stop by an island of the Bahamas, but the weather was too rough.  This little island was owened by Princess and you had to get on smaller boats while the Star Princess was anchored off shore and the high winds didn't permit that.  I took the opportunity of another day at sea to have a massage.  Very special (not as good as Chadwick, of course). It included a rest on a hot rock bed afterwards, an aromatherapt sauna and a tropical rainforest mist shower.  Other activities throughout the 7 days were:  jet skiing, snorkeling, hot tubbing, golf chipping, movies, shopping, comedy and magic, and, an all male wet t-shirt contest (and that's not an exhaustive list).

Being with my family was ok, I guess.  Ronnie, the groom, is a nice enough fellow.  He's from Montreal and I got to meet a lot of other French-Canadians.  It was also nice to see my side of the fam.  (of cours there was much drama, but would a reunion be without a little?).  Lorry and I shared a cabin, so we have to not see eachother for a few months now.  My beatiful aunt Laura is on Prozac, so was on cloud nine the whole time (even able to put up with her 80 y/o mother who wouldn't leave her side) and was a pleasure to be around.  Her son, Larry, won 1,500 gambling.  Rita, Bernice's (the bride's) sister brought her two boys who I had not met yet, so I got to do that. 

Right now I'm actually feeling a bit under the weather.  I suppose I should be glad I didn't get sick until the end of the stay, but I hate flying with a cold and hate not being able to fully enjoy the one day I have free between coming back to NY and having to return to work Tuesday.  Erik came by to see me yesterday and I felt back that I wasn't up to the welcome home celebration we had both been envisioning. That's all folks.  Sorry for the spelling errors, I'm in a DayQuill trance."

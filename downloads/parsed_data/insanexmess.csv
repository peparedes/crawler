i would some other mp3 player. but i want a good mp3 player that can play videos. that would be the coolest evar.&nbsp; 
the concert last night was fun. BUT. there is no way i'm going to go see any of those bands ever again. it's like seeing fall out boy all over again. 
all in all, panic at the disco was the worst band of the night. fun to sing along to. but all of the 13 year old girls new all of their lyrics pulling off the little ""rock on"" sign with their first finger and their pinky, thinking they were punk rock. it was funny.&nbsp;

i dyed my hair. yeah. it's really different, never done anything like it before. it's like...kpop singer-ish. hahaha.
so yeeah. thie spring break is going by way too fast. the thought of school just puts more stress into my head. wonderful.

I love it though, strangely enough. What sucks, is that today, is a hardcore studying day. I have 2 big tests tomorrow....and they're also quite hard. WOO. Just great. <BR>School got out at like 11 today. It was totally unexpected...the power went out, and the people at school were just like...no school. And I was like...yes. Today's my day. But boy, was I wrong. I stayed at school until like 4, all by myself, but it was alot of fun. I played on the school's drumset. I played that thing so hard, I almost puked. That's how brutal I am. Oh, and I broke a drum stick. What fun.<BR>I feel really weird right now. I want christmas break to come. Like right now. I still have finals to worry about....that's killing me right now. I can't even relax. Because here and there...I'm getting pressured to do this or that. And.....freaking teachers at our school. Well. All of my teachers are great, except for one. The teacher totally like favors these certain people in my class, and helps them do things, and encourages them, etc. It's almost like the teacher is a student, acting like she is too good for some of us. I hate her. Actually not really hate, that's too strong of a word. I'll just say I dislike her....alot. If she would just open her eyes and see what she is doing...asdk.jhldkf. <BR>That's not the only reason I'm feeling weird. It's just...life in general. It's about how depressing life is sometimes. I'm not depressed. Not sad. Just sometimes, very lost, and confused. It seems like I'm never going to get this over with. High school. But what sucks...is that it's only going to get worse. And in college, I'm going to wish I was in high school again. And when I'm done with school....I'm going to wish I was back in college again. See, it's stuff like this that makes me so discouraged. It's almost like I'm doing this for nothing. But it's always going to be important. Whether I like it or not.<BR>OKAY. Well i'm done ranting about school. It sucks, I guess you can say.<BR>I'm going to fail those 2 tests tomorrow......ua,djklfhlaksjdfhs</P>

"event","<P>Well.....It's been quite a while since I last posted anything. So, I shall fill you in on what's been going on lately. School. School School SCHOOL. Biology class. Sucks so hard. It's the worst class this year. I'm just happy it's the only subject this year that we don't have a final in. That would be brutal. Well, pretty much I hate every class I have at school. But whatever. School's always gonna be a bitch.<BR>Been playing a couple shows here and there, and they've all been alright I guess. I turned 15. I got an Ipod mini. I got new CDs from mewithoutyou, rilo kiley, and death cab for cutie. I'm going to get a new icon for my eljay soon. <BR>Life is amazing. Hard, but amazing. I have a big test to study for tomorrow, and I studied as much as I could understand, but I'm going to go study again in a couple of minutes. I guess school is the thing that takes up most of my life, even though I hate it. I need to manage my time better. I'm really happy that christmas break is next month though. October went by really fast. unbelieveable.<BR>I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not talking to people as much as I used to. I'm not getting much sleep. I feel like I'm sheltering myself. I don't want to. Maybe I'm too self-centered. Because all <STRONG>I'm</STRONG>&nbsp;saying is I. <STRONG>I I I I I I I. </STRONG>What the hell's wrong with me?<BR>Seriously people, don't judge me for how I act. Yeah, I play in a band that sings the song ""Everyday, praising Jesus Christ in every way"". But no one's perfect. I'm not saying I sin on purpose. I'm showing <STRONG>you</STRONG>&nbsp; that I am <STRONG>NOT</STRONG>&nbsp;perfect. Don't have a perfect image of me. I do many things that I regret and wish I didn't do. I don't like it. But I still have enough confidence, strength, and faith&nbsp;to carry on a strong relationship with God. Don't judge me.<BR>Maybe&nbsp;I just need to relax. I always wish I was like some other person. I think I have self-esteem issues. I'm still a 15 year old kid who's desperate for attention, whether I like it or not. Because I, for one, think that crying out for attention is one of the stupidest moves that anyone can ever make, and I laugh at anyone who tries to pull it off. So I laugh at myself. It's a phase. I'll be okay.<BR>I'm not making any sense right now. I <STRONG>really</STRONG> need to relax.</P>"

<P>Yes. YES. I have had an okay week I guess. Everyone was in a good mood this week. I've been alot more tired than usual...which is strange, but it's okay. I've been sleeping well. I haven't been in a bad mood alot lately....so I guess that's a good thing.<BR>OHHHHH shoot, there's one thing that is killing me right now though. PSAT's. The letter ""P"" will just make you say, ""What's the big deal? It's just practice"". I wish I could say the same. I've been stressing about this stuff alot lately, and everyone else is just like...""Eh..no big deal"". I wonder why I feel so different about this. I wonder.....<BR>I guess I'm just waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too paranoid. I&nbsp;want to go to a good college...and I want to live a good future. But the real SAT test is next year. Hm. Something is wrong here. If you get a good grade on PSAT.....you can get a scholarship. I guess it's the word ""Scholarship"" that gets me. I don't come from a rich family. School = expensive. So yeah.<BR>OKAY I'm so fking done talking about SAT or PSAT or whatever. BLAH. I shouldn't stress about it too much.</P>
<P>The concert on sunday....a few days ago. It was great I guess. Number One Gun was good. They only played one old song, but the new ones were good. Mourning September was good. Spoken and Project 86 were better than I thought they would be. But yeah. It was an interesting concert.</P>

<P>My amp is still in the shop. I need it back...like...now. Or else I'm going to be screwed. I've played about 4 or 5 shows without my amp, and like 5 practices without it.

<P>shiiiiiiiet. I went without eating meat for about 4 months. I knew that I couldn't&nbsp;do it. It's okay&nbsp;though, I'm still straight edge.&nbsp;OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH frick I got a new guitar. I am so spoiled. GOD i hate myself. SO much. I wish&nbsp;I wasn't such a fckin whiner. blah. I went to church today...It was fun I guess. There's always someone who's just...pissed off though...weird.</P>
<P>When I get my amp back.....I am all set. I have all the&nbsp;equipment I will need&nbsp;for a while. A nice guitar, a nice amp....blah blah blah FCKING spoiled. &nbsp;Me and mikey started an acoustic project. We don't have a name yet...Nor do we have any songs. We are going to start ASAP. (my heaviest influence right now is i can make a mess....oh boy) SCHOOL. I love it. It's so much fun. Actually not really. I really don't like my school. They don't give a rat's ass about people who smoke and drink around and about our school...but they like go crazy on people who are wearing jewelry. My school sucks. Well, in general, pretty much about everyone that goes to a school, hates it for some reason. That's mainly my reason. And also the fact that some people at my school suck ass. I hate them all. I hate them I hate them I hate them. </P>
<P>I hate myspace. So much. I don't want to delete it though. To be honest. People suck. Sometimes, I just want to be alone. With someone. (I don't mean it that way). Sometimes, I'm just in this mood to be with this one special person. No one specific, I just picture it in my head. I'm sick of all these middle school crisis/relationships. ""Omg, she doesn't like me, I'm gonna go kill myself.""&nbsp; ""I want her so bad, I'd die for her"". BOO HOO. <STRONG>Cry me a fcking river.</STRONG> Grow up a little and live for something else. You'll have much more to worry about than the opposite sex when you're older. </P>
<P>If I offended you...let me know. </P>
<P>I might be going over to mikey's place to sleep over. Show tomorrow. In the afternoon. Hopefully it'll go well. </P>

"event","<P>Today was a strange day...kind of a weird one too. Well, school started on Wednesday...it was alright I guess. Actually that's a lie, it really sucks. It never quits. </P>
<P>Well, after getting some homework on our 3rd day of school, I went to band practice. It was...okay I'll tell you about it.</P>
<P>To start out, my amp doesn't work too well. Some people at camp last summer broke it on accident when they were doing a&nbsp; play. It worked just fine for the next year or so, until like...a couple weeks ago. I've been frustrated at it since.</P>
<P>So today, we were practicing....before we started playing, I prayed that my amp would work fine, because we needed to practice. We have a show with the O.C. Supertones in a couple weeks.....</P>
<P>But anyways, my amp was screwing up when we were playing our....like 4th song. And...I totally just snapped. I was so pissed, I kicked my amp, knocked it over, stomped on it, and threw my guitar down. Really hard. Notice I said, <STRONG>really</STRONG> hard.</P>
<P>I went outside to relax. I thought my equipment was fine.....except for my amp, of course. Of course I have a receipt for my amp, I have a 5-year warranty on it.&nbsp;So I could possibly get it fixed. I thought everything was okay, and I just needed to relax.</P>
<P>After a few minutes, I went back inside to just chill with the guys. They handed me my guitar. My heart sank.</P>
<P>I noticed that there was a huge crack on the neck. Yes ma'am, you guessed it, I had broken my guitar. 400$ down the drain. the worst part is, my parents bought it for me. They work so hard to support what I do, and I just wasted it.&nbsp;I don't&nbsp; have a warranty for it. It's broken. It's gone. Just because of my amp which was already broken, my guitar paid the price.</P>
<P>So yeah. I'm not in a very good mood right now. My mind is just....racing. I don't know what to tell my parents. They are going to be very mad at me. And I just realized that I can't find my receipt for my amp. So I'm pretty much screwed. I have no hope. I have nowhere to turn. My parents are going to murder me. It feels like God is letting this happen to me. I'm not very happy with God right now. </P>
<P>I thought everything was going to be okay, I thought that it wasn't really a big deal, but yup, it really is. 400$ for my guitar. Possibly another 550$ for my amp. I just wasted it all away. I feel so terrible right now. My parents work their arms off, and I just wasted it. Think about how they will feel. They will hurt even more than I do right now. Just because I was angry. Just because I couldn't control my anger.</P>
<P>I don't have any angst. We all have our days. But I tell you, I learned a couple things.</P>
<P>1. <STRONG>You shouldn't blame God for bad things happening, no matter what they are. It's all the devil's fault. As you can tell, I have trouble with that at the moment.</STRONG></P>
<P>2. <STRONG>Don't be angry. Try your best to just relax, not snap like I did. Because I snapped, I had terrible consequences. And trust me, it's <U>NOT</U> worth it.</STRONG></P>
<P>I just need hope. And anger management.</P>
<P>I got a keyboard/synthesizer that my teacher at school sold to me. It's really nice, I like to play it. It's fun. I hope to use that in the band that I play in. Keyboards are fun.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sorry God. AGAIN I have failed you.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Life is hard. I need to do something with more with my life. I'm not good at sports. I'm too young to get a job. I&nbsp;probably won't even get enough money to save up for my parents on their birthday....man I'm such a terrible person.</STRONG></P>

BORING
I'm out of town. Up in Glacier View Ranch. Man I want to go home
This weekend...was alright. Saturday I went to Stephen's house for a birthday party...everyone slept over, but since I'm too cool for them, I went home. Ha kidding.
Sunday, went back to Stephen's and just hung. Then after that I did some yardwork at my house and came here.
And now, I am sitting here. so bored. 
Must find something to do.

Uhm...I'm not going to PUC...kinda pissed, but there's always next year.
I got my iPod shuffle on Thursday. It is soooo cool.
And, just a couple minutes ago I bought tickets to the Tegan and Sara show on Saturday.
Me and my brother are going, and it is going to be a freaking awesome party.

School is over. Old news. 
Been buying alot of CDs. 
At the moment, saving up for a PSP and an iPod shuffle. Accepting donations from anyone :-) 
Just been hanging with my friends, playing shows and practicing. Nothing new at all. 
Okay so........July 6. I left for California. KAYAAM. It was really good, it started out crappy and bland, but got much better as it kept on going. 3 days later, that Saturday, we left for Mexico. We pretty much camped in a desert that had no good showers (unless you wanted to shower with mosquito water), and a wooden box with a ditch under it for a bathroom. it was hilarious. Everyday we went out to a work site and worked on the house for 8 hours a day. we didn't finish it, of course, but we did
quite a bit. Food was good. July 13....left california to come back to my home in Denver, Colorado. (Saw Ina at the airport and rode the same flight with her.) The day after, I went camping for the weekend, which was okay. I don't really want to go into detail about it though...got back from camping today. 
Now i am extremely bored. I miss everyone i met at KAYAAM. I'm trying my best to go to PUC. Yup, this summer is going well. Hopefully later today i can go look for a job....hopefully someone with a kind heart will accept a 14 year old who needs some money.... Have a great week everyone."

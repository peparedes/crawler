"event","Well those UFN2 picks show just how smart i am, only one winner correct, and not even how he won it.  Ah well, shows how much i know.

Anyway, The mighty OIL are 1-0, while the godless flames are 0-1, absolutely beautiful.  I have been hard on Horcoff before, but if he can keep playing with the speed and vision he did last night all the power too him.  I must ask thought for Jussi to get healthy, and get healthy NOW!!!.  Ty needs to watch a few games from the bench, and he needs a sense of desperation to be the goalie i hope he can be.  

Man, good ole JR is gonna be gone, why, and to replace him with Mike Goldberg from the UFC, wow.  Just shows how much Vince can spend and how little Zuffa likes to spend.  I mean the ufc is just shooting themselves in the foot here, First by Lowballing the big name fighters like Tito(albeit his reign is done), and BJ.  Then they refuse Sherdog, fcfighter etc the media credits.  I pray that pride makes inroads in North America, just to shove it down Dana McMahon er Whites throat.  

Anyway, TUF 2 is just not doing it for me, the fights are brutal, only Jason v Jorge had any excitement in it."

"event","Well, only 2 more days until the hockey season, and my Oil have a huge Question mark in between the pipes.  I wouldn't be so worried if Markkanen was healthy, but he is not, and Conklin is crapping the bed.  Here is to a speedy recovery for ya Jussi.

AS for tonite, i am torn, i want to watch the Raw homecoming, but there is also ufc on spike, so it is a toss up, i will probably just flick back and forth


My picks fot the 3 main bouts

Leben by KO  R1
Koscheck by Sub  R2
Tanner by Sub R2


cheers."

"event","WEll, Yesterday was a brutal day at work, my store sucked ass, it is the worst day i have ever had as a manager.  

Last night was a total waste, i did nothing but watch the redsox and bluejays.  Damn the redsox need bullpen help.  Why don't they just bring in the pitchers from the hawaii team that won the little league world series, they can't do any worse.

1 week to go until the NHL season starts, and i am pumped.  Can't wait to watch the Oilers and see just how Pronger looks.

WEll here goes nothing, i have already done more here today than yesterday."

"event","So it has been awhile, whatever

Watching TUF2 last night, it was pretty good, Finally some fighters who want to leave it all on the mat.  Jason looked pretty akward in some of his punches, but hey he got the job done.  Jorge showed all kinds of heart, but he did not really show much BJJ skills.

My sister comes home tonite, so i am currently pumped royally."

I was watching wimbledon the other day, Federer vs Hewitt, all i can say is that Federer is on another planet compared to everyone else.  This guy is like the terminator, he is unstoppable.  There is no weakness in his game, and he can capitalize on his opponents weakness, or turn his opponents strength against them.  I do believe we are looking at the greatest of all time when we watch him.  I wish he could play the Pete Sampras of the mid 90's on a grass court.  What a match that would be."

"event","So i saw the Phantom of the opera tonite, and i thought it was an awesome flick.  I did see the musical, about 10 years ago, and i loved it. I loved the movie just about as much.  the cast was awesome, and the directing was great.  The mood was set up perfect.  In my opinion you have to see this flick.  

I haven't even mentioned the phenomenal soundtrack.  The music captured the sound of a theatre perfectly, i am going to buy this soundtrack for sure."

"event","well, the season is 1/2 way over, and we are in the bottom half of the league, but the kids are picking it up.  The unfortunately thing is that we lost one of our best kids for the season with a knee injury, and that really sucks.  We shall see what this team can do in the other half of the season.

Now, on to other things, the pride ppv on new years eve.  Sakuraba cannot fight, and so silva is opponent less.  It looks like possibly mark hunt, and that will be a good fight.  Personally i would like to see Cro cop vs Silva.  I think that silva would win the rematch no problem.  Silva would probably be the favorite for his fight, no matter who the opponent is.  On to fedor vs nog.  Unfortunately for nog who is one of my faves, i think that fedor will beat him.  i don't think that there is anyone who can beat fedor, except possibly on the perfect day, cro cop, and maybe barnett, if he trains properly.

Oh well, we will probably not see the fight i am salivating over, couture vs silva.  now that would be a war"

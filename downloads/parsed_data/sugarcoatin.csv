Well I guess I got out of my LJ routine, but I wont let that happen again...newayz, I got a flu or fever or w/e u wanna call it right now so I'm home on this pretty fall-y monday. whats been happening??? not that much. well good stuff newayz. im grounded right now which totally SUCKS and i dont wanna even go into why I am but just believe me that I am!!! lol. yea. I'm getting a little worried tho, because I'm falling behind in my college process. UGH. I dont wanna write essays or any of that shit at all. ugghhhh :( 

OMG I hate these chills, then they turn into hot flashes. They're really bad too. The only thing making me feel good is looking down at my fake fingernails that I got done at Hollywood Nails w/ Danielle. That was fun. This weekend Jocelyn should be sleeping over if all goes well.

Well most kids say it anyway, I learned this when my bro's england kid said 'cheers' to me when I gave him something, and I was like, wheres the drink? haha. Speaking of drink, I'm hoping to visit Mike this weekend at college and his friend Steph wants to take my partying [haha thanks mike, I knew you told her about that! ;)] So that will be fun. 

Yea I'm really stressed out right now, and I wont go into why, but this week with the 1/2 days wont help at all but I guess it's better than a whole day. I luv the FALL here. I think thats the best season for this place....but yea. My eyes are really dry right now. Ugh. 

BUT OK ... so noone told me their halloween plans yet. And I can take that as a hint meaning no one wants me included in their plans, or that no one has any. Hmm...but ok. 

 Gotta go do something that I don't know what it is yet. But I'm gonna think about it.

So turns out my dad had my schedule this whole time, so thankfully I found this out Thurs. night so I could go in on the very last day that u could change ur schedule. I dropped honors english and tried to get self gym, but Mr agnoli recommended to read the packet before deciding. I just basically need to join a class by a professional in anything athletic. So I might do it.

Saturday I went off to finish my basic shopping. Got a bag, [for school..hopefully its big enough], sneakers, tops/sweaters. No pants really...I did that last time :)

So Mike leaves this Thursday!!!!! :( :( :( :( So him, me and annette [wow thats really not 'literate' or w/e] are gonna hang out tonight. One of the last times :(

    Working 3-9pm later. Ugh.

Sorry for the lack of updates. Been workin, hangin, and just not much has happened!

I did go off island on Saturday, bought 7 pairs of jeans, and like, no tops. But thats a seperate trip. 
I'm still in denial that school is like, right around the corner. WTF did the summer go?! Ah. And I need to go to that guidance-switch-classes thingy, cuz I didn't do any of the honors english work! lol. too late. 

Fair is this week, too! I think I'm gonna go Saturday night. Maybe I'll see some of you guys there? Cant go to the fireworks...gotta work :(

Well, if you got ur schedule in the mail and aren't gonna change it, leave it in the comments so I can see if we have any of the same classes. I think I'm gonna have like 4 study halls .... lol.

So it was FUN...us three (you should know by now-Mike, Annette, and Me) danced that fuckin night away. It was fun...I think we're gonna do it next week too. I want to at least.

annette's bf and fam backed out on coming this week, too. I guess too long of a drive or somethin. so that's on hold as well. other than that, not much has been goin on. OH WAIT. 

Mike, Annette, and me are wanting to go to Kalidescope (sp?) Tattoo and get piercings. I wanted my nose and belly pierced, Mike wants his eyebrow pierced, and Annette's cartilidge. (ear) BUT turns out I have to wait until 18...FUCK. They don't even accept parental consent! How fucked up is that?! Mike seems to think it's just that place, not a state rule...ANYONE KNOW? I really want it done, and if you know another tattoo/piercing place on island, tell me in the comments. I want to know soon, cuz I think mike and annette are gonna go ahead and do it w/o me this week! :("

Waiting for mike to pick up his fuckin' phone (!) so I can know if he wants to do this thing with us tonight. Hopefully he does, and he should be home, cuz he doesn't work today. WTF. Ok. Tryin his cell phone. FUCK. Message person.

Whatever. Well, if anyone is in OB tonight, and going to teen night, LOL...look for us. Holy shit, are we gonna rock that dance floor. Me and Annette have been making up 'moves' at work. LOL. Funny shit. 

So yea. And as we asked the Ouji if Annette's 'friend' is gonna be there tonight, it said 'Yes' so she's all freaked out, b/c her bf is coming down TOMORROW with his whole family, too. OMG, is that drama. (She's recently had a major falling out with his family, so it's now an umcomfortable situation when he comes down.)

But nothing will happen. Hopefully not, b/c I want it to be fun tonight. 

Let u know what happens! Check back prob. tomorrow.

Anyways, this Saturday I think me, mike, and annette wanted to check out the 16-20 night at the AC. We really don't know what to expect- it probably will suck- but we're gonna try to have a good time. And the guy we met last night (again, this is in lucie's comments) is too old to get in, so IDK if he's gonna be there. But he liked Annette, (they had soooo much in common, at least music wise) so who knows. Might just show up. 

OMG I'm sooo tired. We did the Ouiji board again last night, helped some of our questions. Man, that thing is creepy! It was working pretty well, but those open ended questions don't always make sense. Like spelling out names?? Yea. 

Oh and I saw Hannah in town last night, Lucie. Don't you love when you don't see her walking by, and she just grabs one of your body parts? Oh that's fun. (serious face)"

"event","Today I did my first Tarot (prounounced Tar-row, not actually Tar-oT!)Card reading. 

Overall, it seemed very accurate. I decided to do the 'Planetary Spread' which includes seven cards, that you lay out in the shape of a star. In the star shape, each point has it's topic: For instance, Home Matters/Family. Or Love and relationships, Business matters, etc. And when you see what card is drawn out in that particular place, it reflects on what is/will happen to it. I personally liked it, and like the particular spread for me, at least, because it focuses on what's currently happening, and in the near future. Have I lost you yet? Probably. 

But it was fun, and enlightening. The only part that's a drag is after every reading, you have to put all the cards back into the exact place. (That's because you have to shuffle thoroughly). 

And I desperately need a bag for them, too! Anyone have any velvet or cool smallish bags you don't need? Let me know. lol.) 

Goin to work 3-9pm. TTYL,

I just went to the Magic store in VH and bought a Tarot Card set. I picked it out by myself, and I'm reading the book right now (about the cards meanings and history of the 'Fool'.) Once I get better, if you want a reading, let me know :).

I really want to get into the mystical part of it, tho. 
LAST NIGHT ME AND ANNETTE PLAYED MY OUIJA BOARD and holy shit! It moved soooooooooo fast and was awesome. It answered some of our personal questions, and when we asked an open ended once, it started to spell out wacky answers, like weird initials for something, that we're still trying to figure out. Weird. But it was awesome. 

So ya..today my relatives are coming down around 11:00am by the boat or something, and we're meeting them for lunch at the Harborview. Then we'll probably shop around Edgartown for a little bit.

So I work 3-9pm again today. And then relatives are coming down this Thursday, so I asked to get Thurs. off and work Sat (3-9pm) instead. So that's what I'm doing. We're probably just gonna go to Edg. and shop with little or no money that I have. HAHA. ya. ok not funny now.

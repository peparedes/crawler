"event","Well like tom wrote in his journal our landlord/owner cashed the $500 check and now hopefully the eviction will be null and void since we do not owe $2400 anymore. We also get paid tomorrow and i after i pay other bills we are going to give him a check for either $200 or $300 bring our total down to $1700 or $1600. Still no word from the school on when he'll get the $1500 but if he sells his car before that check comes in then we still have the $1500. One guy seemed really interested in it so hopefully one or both of those things happen soon. I still have to talk to my union rep to inform her that my old director at the youth center is breaking the privacy act of 1974 and saying too much info to prospective employers. I told the director at Kindercare that my old director has a personal grudge against me and that she should talk to someone else that works their. Hopefully she was able to get a hold of someone and they gave me a good reference. And hopefull i get that job. Everyone keep your fingers crossed."

"event","Well i called and talked to kindercare yesterday.It seems that sombody at the youth center had told her more than they were supposed to about my supposed work ethics. But she still said the only real thing holding me up was my lack of references from mervyns. They gave her their automated number for refrence. I told her to call back on tues(today) and asked to speak to two of my bosses by name. I then told those two bosses to expect a call sometime today so hopefully things went well. Keep your fringers crossed all the way around for us.  I will be calling back sometime tommorrow to see if she called or not and to find out who said what about me. So i can report them and see if i can add blackballing me to my list of complaints against the youth center. I think that will make my case even more to my advantage. Well i need to eat something and go to bed."

The Angel is associated with the concept of virtue,<br>the number 2, and the element of wind.
Her sign is the zenith sun.

When you show them the truth they decided that your wrong. well like a lot of other people have said, our journals are for our own rating and ravinf so i will do just that. when the need occurs.  I guess someone out their did not like the respons i put on their lj so they decided to make it private so others cant read it anymore.  Hopefully one of my friends has this person so they could read about this.  If not oh well life is life I am sure she will hear about this and read it later.  You don't fuck your friends over especially in their love life especially whne that person is the worlds most understanding soul.  You have wounded her deaply and I don't know if she can recover from this.  I hope she can for your sake as well as hers.  I love my family whether they are blood or not and i would never have done what this person did. I hope she can live with herself and the mistake that she has made in her life.  She saw the chance of someone close to her being happy with someone and she did not like it so she took that happyness away from a good, kind, and caring person. I hate Bitchy people."

"event","I don't understand how people can be so mean and so cruel.  Or how people who were supposed to be your friends treat you as if you don't exist.  Life is difficult enough without having to go through crap where you don't know who your friends are. Or why they all of a sudden don't like you anymore and decided that they don't want anything to do with you anymore.  Its funny how you can be the kind of person who thinks about others before yourself and you give and you give and then those you called friends those you could sit with and shoot the breaze with, or just have a soft shoulder to lay or cry on turn on you and walk by you like you don't even exit. Like you don't have feeling , like you're not getting hurt each and everytime they treat you like you are nothing to them, just some strange person they see even once  in awhile or even worse someone they just don't see anymore.  You all of those kind of people in your life. You walk by them eveyday and yet if somebody asked you about them you wouldn't even be able to tell them what that person was wearing. I guess I don't understand how friends can fall so far apart on a one sided way.  Where one person would like to have the friendship back or at least a talking mode back and the other part doesn't even see you in their path.  Maybe there is someone out there who can explain this and maybe their isn't.  I just want people to know that eveyone no matter who they are has feelings and treating people like they are not even there isn't cool especially when those are going through emotional termoil as well as other things.If you don't want to ever talk to that peron again that is fine but at least show them that you see them as a person and treat them like shit if you want but don't treat them like they are not even there.  I guess I just feel lonely.  It not easy not having friends when you used to be able to count on people. I guess I just miss my baby girl, she will be on her to disneyland in a few hours and will be gone for five days.  Thank heavens for unconditional motherly love.  Well I need to eat and then sleep. Hopefully when I wake up the world might be a nice place to be in... maybe then again I might just win the lotto."

Hopefully it offers benefits so i don't have to work so much and maybe stay home and clean my house. Those of you who know me know what i am talking about. I wish that I could help out more around here than I do.I just get so tired and my feet hurt after twelve to fifteen hour days i can't do much but eat and sleep and I rarely do either one of those anyways.  Well I finally got off my ass and order my mags dress. It came in on friday and I am so happy. It needs a few fixings but soon it will be good to go.  I need to get materials for the other costume but my dress will be done hopefully before the end of march.  I am not trying to get the part just yet. I want to have my outfits completed before i get into that. Also my other half needs to have a better paying job so i can get the 'rents to watch our daughter for us so we can go.  I know if i tried right now they would get mad at me and i don't need that. Also I need to start rehearsing again.  This time I will not have Angela to help me. She was one of the old mags when we were at the UC. I know the people that I have to proof myself against are going to judge me very harshly, probably more harsly than they would anyone else. I just hope I can do a good job. I don't know if I'll be able to get it all done this year but hopefull by next year I will have the costume's done and have my courage up to brave them and do the audition. I'll have to find a Riff though.  I think I'll ask an old riff off of a different cast. The three that we have right now could partner up with me. Two are judges and the other... well lets just say he's mad at me right now and I wish I knew why that way i could say sorry and try not to do that ever again.  But hey that's the way the cookie crumbles or so the saying goes. I'm still excited about my dress though. I bought some new stockings for my school girl uniform. I hope they look real cool with the outfit. I have to get that fixed too. Well my kid needs me so I gotta go just needed to talk. Hope the show goes well tonight all y'all."

"event","Well I guess I am a bitch oh wait a minute that is a well know fact just ask anybody who knows me.  I went out last night to a place that i haven't been to in about a month.  It was valentines night ans i wanted to spend it with my sweatheart.  So I am a place that I had hoped would be free of drama but it ended up in it.  At this place I normally helped out with different things. One of them is to help cleanup.  I had gotten a jacket for a friend and then went back inside to start cleaning. I saw a mess that was sweeped together on the floor and i asked the closes person who was also helping clean where the dust pans were out, since that person had been cleaning up longer that night than i was. Istead of answering me that person walked away. So I went to the head of the department and asked her to talk to that person about that.She said that she doesn't want ot get involved with it. I told her that if he was helping her and then acting the way he was to other helpers it does make her involved because of what her postion is.  She still refused, so I went to a director and asked her a question. and she agreed with me that it is the head of the departments place to table issues like that and not to have to take it to the directors like i had to do.  So as I was trying to go home because i had to be at work at 5am I went to try and tell the said director bye and she was talking to the head of cleanup and the said person and I overheard something that I just didn't want to get involved in, even though the topic of conversion was me. I yelled bye to the two directors that were there and left.  I then read what someone had posted about that night and if me being at that place spells drama and bullshit for him then say i you see me there and don't want bull then go home.  Because if you go to a place and expect bullshit (so sorry charlie) you'll always get it because if you expect it to happen then you'll always find a way to have it come out that way.  I didn't want any bull to happend that night I just wanted a night out and have some fun with my friends. Sorry if we have the same hangout I was at that place first so get used to me being there."

Friends come and go, they either move away or just decided that they don't want to be your friend anymore for reason unknown to others. and sometimes when that happens they take other friends with them.  I have lost a lot of people in my life and the feelings of being a nobody or an unwanted person stays with you. Whether your seven years old and moving to another state because of your parents job or your friends decided not to care about you anymore.  Family members leave by death of just by moving away.  Sometimes friends end up being like family and it hurts just as much. I hope know all this bullshit can stop and people can just drop it and go on with their life.  I doubt that will happen but we all can have wishes.  Maybe someday i'll find a fairy and see if i can get my three wishes. Well i need to go to bed know and hope i can get some sleep.

But sometimes you cant help whats going on in your life.  I need to check on my kid now have fun all and don't do anything i would do.  On second thought no!"

"event","Well like my title states, life isn't easy.  Lets see things in my life have gone from bad to worse. I don't know what to do anymore. I have tried and tried to be the best person I can be at everything, my jobs, my school, my motherhood status, being a good friend; but i guess nothing is what you want it to be.  Its hard to know when to let things go and when to fight.  I have lost too many friends in my life due to circumstances beyond my control. I guess i just don't know when to give up. I alway thought that was a good thing but i guess its not.  If anyone actually reads this, I need some advice.  I have lost two friends within the last month and i have tried to make amends (even though i don't know what i did to lose that friendship).  I have apolized to one of them for a misunderstanding that took place but nothing has come of it.  My question is Should I let my friends go without a fight and give up or should i fight for what friends i have left in my life and try to find a way for to find out what i did and try to fix whatever i did?  If anyone can help me please do so."

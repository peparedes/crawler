1. Wear a top hat. 
2. Throw popcorn in the air & yell, ""It's snowing!"" 
3. Go, ""Ooooh..."" whenever anyone kisses. 
4. Clap when the good guy gets killed. 
5. Make a noise like you're passing gas, & go, ""Ahhh..."" 
6. During the previews yell, ""Can you fast-forward it?"" 
7. Whenever the bad guy is doing something devious yell, ""Watch out!!"" 
8. Laugh very loudly at all the corny jokes. 
9. Tell the man selling popcorn that the girls toilet is flooding. 
10. Yell out what is going to happen. 
11. Tell the man next to you that you have diarrhea, & wink while smiling. 
12. Wear a cape, & when it's your turn to get popcorn yell, ""I'm Batman!! Hahaha!!"" & run away. 
13. Yell, ""Fire!!"" & moon the people going through the exit. 
14. Tell people they cannot sit next to you, `coz your invisible friend already is. 
15. Yell outloud, ""Stop molesting me!"" 
16. Gently, very softly, place a sin
Goalkeep527: 17. Scream out, ""Hey, this isn't Bambi, I want my money back!!"" 
18. Stare at the person across the aisle from you, then quickly look back at the screen when they notice you, then stare at them again, when they look back at the screen. 
19. See if you can get a moistened sweet to stick to the screen. 
20. Yell to the projectionist, ""Can you pause it? - I gotta pee!!

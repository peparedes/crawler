i had lots of homework to do today. made me happy. i didn't sleep, and it kept me busy. like a bee. woot. took me almost 3 hours. i still need to memorize some lines for drama. but i have the basic content... i can wing it a little. right?

i have almost 100% decided against going to homecoming. there won't be anyone to talk to, chris won't be there, i have nothing to wear, and i'm not excited about it. at all. don't worry guys, i'll be at the game. i took the WHOLE day off just for our shitty school. i mean that with all the love in the world. 

news for today:
- mitch has a gf. yay for him!
- varsity football won against cenntennial. take that dave!
- shellie had six shirts on.
- jonas was wearing a coconut bra... interesting.
- i didn't dress up for the day.

tomorrow is twin day. and i'm shellie's twin. nothing real special.. just the normal attire... i guess...

i'm so bored and tired. so i'm gonna go to sleep.

i love you all the same."

christopher just called me. yay. 

today was actually pretty good.

<b>1st pd.</b> i was late. :-\ but, we finished act 2 of the play and yea. it's getting tense. and i found out that i'm working with a chick named meagan amd i'm the kid named chris. jessica thought that was funny cuz chris is my boyfriend. yup. i odnt' find it all that funny. but, whatever.
<b>advisory</b> one word: retarded.
<b>2nd pd.</b> i was early! woot. first person. we had a sub. we made 2 programs and that was it. good times. talked to jenn.
<b>3rd pd.</b> I HATE THIS CLASS. the women is a flipping twit. can't teach. i did my work out of boredom. whatever.
<b>4th pd.</b> chemistry! yay. love this silly class. dunno why. just do. we played jeapordy and my team lost. i knew all the answers. that's the way it goes. cuz the people in there are stupid jocks and retarted preps.
<b>5th pd.</b> talked about persuasion. somehow got on the subject of abortion. didn't really go into it tho. talked to shellie and mitch-mitch.
<b>6th pd.</b> took a quiz. easy stuff. wanted to go to the drama room for the rest of the day. didn't tho cuz she wouldn't let me. that's okeys. 
chris picked me up!! yay. made me really happy. cuz i don't get to see him enough. i think that not seeing him EVERY day is making me love him more. and i think it is having the same effect on him. cuz he actually cares about my days and he is being all cute and stuff. makes me realllly happy. 

SO EXCITCED ABOUT MY RING. i wants it NOW. but can't. must wait till tomorrow morning. i need to get up early. and be ready to leave and stuff.

I GET TO MAKE FLYERS!!!!!!!!!!!! i lurve making flyers. it's so much fun. umm, i have to get the whole like... program together. i could prolly do the whole thing by myself, with like one sidekick, but i have THREE sidekicks. melissa, jessica, and rachel. yay. 
after tech, i went to rounding third with jessica and mitch-mitch. yay. we played DDR and i found 5 tokens in random machines. yup. fun stuff. we only stayed for like, an hour. my legs hurt now.

so, i have this friend(A). and another friend(B). i was walking with B and A comes up and goes ""hey!"" and we start talking. meanwhile, B was still walking with me. so, A goes away to class, and B goes ""eww, why the fuck do you talk to them?"" and i said, ""because, they are my friend. and they are really nice contrary to what you or anyone else thinks."" and B gives me this weird look and says fine. and we drop it. 

i don't get it. how can you have animosity towards someone that you have never even held a conversation with? and how can you say someone is mean/rude/stupid because of their choices in friends? if that were true, i would be a band geek/druggie/retarded/stuck up. so, think before you judge someone. unless you have one on one prior knowledge as to how they are."

i don't want to like you.
why do you have to be so perfect?
you need flaws.
why are you so passionate?
<b>HATE ME.</b>
i know that if you hated me, i would stop liking you. 
no, i probably wouldn't. 
and i would still like you.
why don't you just be an ass to me?
<i>make me stop liking you.</i>
just stop being such a perfect person. 
yea, so, you don't look like the most ideal person.
but i don't care. 
to me, you look just as good as any jock, or pretty boy.
your voice is soothing. 
you care so much about everyone. 
you want everyone to be happy.
yet you aren't always happy yourself.

<b>period 2</b> did my work, which was easy, and discovered some <i>videos</i> on my blink cd. it made my day soooo good. *does a happy dance in which she jumps on the walls* they are awesome-ness!
<b>period 3</b> sucked. bad. like a hoe that wants her payment from a hard to please customer. i hate that teaceher.
<b>period 4</b> made a silly collage. *shrugs* he wants me to cut up stuff i brought in. and it's all REALLY important stuff. signatures from twitch, card from joey's family, prom booklet... i'm not TOUCHING(as in hurting it) that stuff much less cutting it. i was all protective of it. and yea. he looked at me funnily. 
<b>lunch</b> goooood times. except someone did piss me off. o well. *smacks self to shut up* i'm so dumb. 
<b>period 5</b> we finished the crucible. it was a good play. i liked it. i talked to shellie and mitch. good times.

i hope tomorrow is okeys. i get paid and i will prolly go shopping with mex-a-ma-co. yay! i have a LIST of shit i need/want to get. i'll post it here. 
+ taking back sunday (jim's recommendation)
+ coheed and cambria (jim's recommendation)
+ erin's birf-day present. i know what i'm getting her! yay.
+ some undies and bras. yay for undergarments. i love shopping for this shit. most people like jeans and shirts. no, i like the understuff. :-D
+ a phone cover cuz mine sucks.
+ and i have to save some for the <i>FUCKING</i> PA system.

so that's about.. $80. i hope i have enough. i'll prolly ask my mom to use the sears card or something for the undies and stuff. *sigh*
o yea. and i still have to pay my dad off.

so, today, i was about to fall asleep, and i wake myself up because i was dreaming about zombies. that hasn't happened for a LONG time. yea. it was freaky. cuz one actually bit me. and i started dieing and stuff. and the ""virus"" overtook me and... *shudders* that's some scary shit. 

*yells at brother* get out of the fucking bathroom!

i have been saying fuck, fucker, motherfucker... etc, a lot lately... and it's just slipping off my tongue. i'm afraid i'm gonna say it in front of my mom.

so, my day!
+ 1st period was okeys. i played someone who was hung over, and... we read some shit out of a book. yup. 
+ 2nd period i took a test which i finished in all of about... oh, LITTERALLY five minutes. 40 multiple choice, 5 parts of a window, and a thing for online help. it was mucho easy. yup.
+ 3rd period was shit. i took, yes, another test. i did really horrible. i swear she didn't teach ANY of it. fucker! i hate that women with a passion. ms. barlow and suck on my left ass cheek.
+ 4(b)th period was awesome. art. yup. i made a really shitty drawing of a cow. it was amusing. at least glen thought so. and, i also drew stygian. i love my guitar (which i am no spelling gooeytar).
+ lunch was... eh.
+ 5th period. i heart mr. bertak. he is my favorite teacher this year. he talks to us like equals. and noise doesn't really bother him too much. and i like how we listen to ""the crucible"" on tape. it's actually a really good book. 
+ 6th period was algebra. i had a headache and pretended to go to the bathroom. i took some tylenol and roamed the halls for a few minutes. just walked... it was nice. i wish i did that more often. 
+ shellie came home with me. and we were on the swings and i was screaming at this dumb ass prick in my neighborhood. and she laughed. shellie had to pee so we went back to my house and ate crackers. with peanut butter. yum. drippy peanut butter :-D
+ dentist. took all of 15 mins and it didn't hurt. at all. not even the littlest bit. yup.
+ gooeytar lesson. it was... entertaining. i learned a blink song. made me happy.
+ came home, ate dinner, did homework, watched some tv, and here i am.

my day was alright. sucky at points, better at others. i didn't fall asleep and i wasn't tired. the best part was my lunch. it was AWESOME.

i went to bed early. for me. sabato called at 11:32 and i was sleeping. so i didn't answer. then milky way called at <b>11:44</b> and i didn't answer. cuz i was fucking sleeping. yup. anywho. i got up on time today. proud of meself. 

i have been neglecting my other journal that no one has cuz i dont think that anyone would want to read it.

i have 20 mins left.

i want to write a song. i want to just... write. but no. i sit here typing up this stupid entry. school makes me so depressed. 

oi. my dad took me to work yesterday (which i don't have to go to until SATURDAY). he lectured me about how i need to do well in school this year and i had to keep my grades up because this year defines my life. FUCK YOU DAD. you suck. get a life and stop being in mine. fucker...

*SNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIF* ew. snot tastes so incredibly bad. 

there needs to be band practice. because i NEED it. the band NEEDS it. our concert is in <sub>less</sub> than a month. and i have learned <i>one</i> original. and i can't practice it because i dont have music to go to it. and, i learned it in the span of about 5 minutes. gah. and i have to buy a PA system. it's gonna cost me $400. and i don't have that kind of money. but ya see, if each member kicked in an equal amount of money, each person would end up spending $80. now, doesn't that seem better? i mean, it's not like we are gonna break up anytime soon. and it's better for the entire band to own it. instead of just me because when and if we break up there will be drama and fighting over the PA. like they had with the mic with the old guy. and it sucks anyways. FUCK. too stressed about the band. i want to make flyers for the concert and pass them out here and shit. and i wanna get stickers made and a website and i wanna record shit. i want the band to actually take off. cuz it's not right now. it's at a stand still. 

bored. bored. bored........... bored. 

gonna go play games or something. BYE.

One more time you will laugh about it
And he'll never try to give you more
And I don't care, he is such a dick
Treats you like you are a stupid whore
And it seems like things will never change
You go on, every cloud is in your way
And I know you feel empty all the time
You'll never listen to anything that I say

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

Why leave when you claim it is love?
But why stay when you're not the only one?
She's proved she's strong
Be brave, be strong

She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more

She's better off sleeping on the floor
She's better off sleeping on the floor
Because she fell right off her bed"

thursday is 10 months no cutting. yay. still going strong? i think so. temptation is a hard thing to beat. whatever. i don't really give a shit.

blink isn't even helping. usually they make me really happy. NO. not today.

here's where i scream.

<font size=6>RAWRRRRRRRRR!!!!</font>

now for some lyrics.

She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving
The good intentions that you had
Now only came to this
And although she saw the mark
The arrow missed

It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting when routine get boring

Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end

And she said, ""It could never survive
With such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again
We may never come back
The strike of a match
The candle's burning at both ends""

And now she knows too much
And I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move

I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool
I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone

I know
Just where
I stand
A boy
Trapped in the body of a man and

I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
From a movie I'm not in

She's so important
And I'm so retarded

And now I realize
I should have kissed you in LA
But I drove home all alone
As if I had a choice, anyway

Where are you coming from?
What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see?

And if you're feeling scared
Remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything
You know that it meant everything to me

You know that it meant everything to me"

"event","bah. im so tired.  i woke up at <strong>7:12</strong> today. way to go lex! needless to say, i threw on some clothes and literally ran out the door. i didnt even get to take my morning shower! i hate when that happens.

so i took a shower just now and it was wonderful. 

Lil Abner tonight. so far its been lame. for some reason i just dont have the patience for it. and last night was the worst. katz was trying to choreograph the scene where abner gets hit on the head with a champagne bottle and it just wasn't working. so of course everyone gets bored and what not. seriously, i think we tried a dozen scenarios and none of them worked at all. i think thats the time when you say.. ok new musical! this one sucks! it's fun to actually do it... but the idea is stupid. i dont know how much sense that makes.

everyone's at the hockey game except for me. boo.

when i came home from school i had a huuge craving for cheese and crackers.. well we had the crackers but no cheese.. except for the gross moldy kind that i believe is not fit for human consumption. so how does one solve this problem? simply go out and buy cheese. and i did. vermont extra sharp cheddar. my cheese and crackers were superb. 

i want to watch saved.. or billy elliot.

""i wont to be a bahllay dahnceh.. its not just foh' poffs!""

haha im a poff. 

no thats a lie...

been awake since 6:30-7 ish yesterday morning... i kind of feel like im floating.. i dont think thats good. ew and its just gross flying on a plane all night, blagh! i do not recomend it.

im so happy to be home though... except Larka ate my Lil Abner script, fucking inbred fuck, im going to euthanize her ass... and the rest of her! also one of the animals shat on my comforter. i was about to jump from a window. whatever im washing all my sheets and getting a new comforter. i dont know what im gonna do about the script though. i'll be honest i cried.. no thats a lie. i bawled my eyes out and screamed like a maniac. can you imagine? quite the picture.

i think i want to get one of those webshots things like kathryn and everyone, because its easier than resizing them and then posting them here. and i have some fun ones of AZ. meh, i'll find someway of doing it.

"event","haha! you guys are all in snow and im in a tshirt!!!

sorry i had to get that out of my system. the weather has been great though. we're staying at the best western and martha is being surprisingly tolerant and tolerable. unfortunately our room doesnt have high speed internet (its the ONLY one) so i have to come down to the lobby to hit up the internet and do all that good stuff. it doesnt work on my computer for some reason though soooooo im on my mom's. and it doesnt have aim. im aimless! 

i kind of miss lunenburg which is weird. i feel terrible for missing Lil' Abner. i think ms, katz is ready to kick me out. whatever. she can shove it right now, im attending to my decrepit grandmother! seriously that woman weighs less than a sparrow. she doesnt eat. poor old lady.

the bell hop is trying to talk to me. aah! save me! earlier today some other hotel worker tried talking to me and i made the sign of the cross with my fingers and booked it!. kidding. but i was like seriously being anti- social. i stuck my face into the computer and pretended like i was working really hard. i was polite though.

whatever im not going to justify my anti-social-ness. boo

i actually have a lot of ideas for this essay. its coming along quite well. but i miss talking to everyone!! aaah! and i tried to get the aol page to work so that i could do it all temporary style. but that didnt work.

kelly called me today. i think it was the best surprise ever. to hear someone from lunenburg call me. yes, i have my cellphone. im starting to think that no one wants me to come home. everyone's hoping i sort of get eaten by a rattle snake or prickled to death by a cactus. 

kidding. anyway, i miss everyone and cant wait to get home. im thinking of stuff that i should bring back as prizes for everyone.. i found these pretty glass rings.. but they were super expensive. 

ok im leaving im really going to go and look for this stuff for the essay.

miss everyone! huuuge hugs and kisses from me to you!"

"event","for some reason this week went by really fast. which was good i was sick of school and wating for vaca. but now that its here i dont know what to do with myself.  im leaving for Arizona on thursday. mother daughter bonding! shoot me in the face. i think im gonna bring my comp just because i need to do that effing essay. thanks hannigan. 

so i havent done much this weekend. i suppose that that is mostly my fault. on friday night we (or who was left of we, kath, vaness and meesh and i) went to kristen's house for sad and mopey girl's night. we have brownie sundaes, soooo fucking good, and watched One True Thing and The Notebook. One True Thing wasnt so sad probably because i didnt really follow it. i left halfway through the notebook because i had work the next morning. it always sounds like a good idea to have a sleepover and then go straight to work. but i hate being all gross in the morning and blah after a sleepover with responsibility cattle- prodding me around that early in the morning. i'd rather just wake up from my own bed and shower and hop into the truck and go straight to work. anyway, thats my rationale for friday night.

tonight i was supposed to do something\... ended up driving around for 2 1/2 hours. yep that was fun. so i went home and watched Girl With a Pearl Earring with my mother who had never seen it and always ruins movies by wanting to know whats gonna happen next or thinking out loud. i could have smacked her. but i controlled myself.  tonight was lame. 

what did everyone else do this weekend?

tuesday night: slumber at chlo flo's! the first neighbor sleepover woot woot!!!!! partay! actually i bet it will be relatively quiet because poor chlo will be all partied out.  :(

bored. maybe i'll watch a film. cinema paradiso perhaps. i love that movie, its soo cute! makes me cry everytime. or saved i havent watched that in a while. 

bah, emo pic. hahahah! i'll take pics of myself. or make new user pics. that always cheers me up."

... maybe its just me. i dont have a valentine

fuck dat, i have a clementine, thats all i need, some good old vitamin C
"" as we goo onnnn, we rememberrrrr""

no, not that Vitamin C, the kind you get from citrus fruits. and calcium.

<strong>i dont need a valentine, i have strong bones!</strong>

but really, i mean if this is the one day in the year that you are supposed to say ""i love you"", isnt that kind of warped? i mean if you love someone shouldn't you tell them that everyday? or at least a little more often than once a year? 

once a month, maybe.  

whatever works. and if you feel pressured to say ""i love you"" on this day then maybe you dont love him/her at all and the whole idea of being with him/her is a bad one. you shouldn't be pressued to say such a strong proclamation. whatever. enough ranting. if i keep going on someone's going to suggest that i write for the lhs newspaper. i can see it now ""The Cynicist's View by Lexie Schaefer""  opposite megan marcil's column. oh that would be funny.  i like megan though, i like her columns. except when she gets personal. like talking about her boyfriend in the last issue of the paper. thats a little too much for me. 

lil abner tonight. i don't know if i want to jump for joy or shoot myself in the head. i hate learning the songs. well i dont hate doing that. it just takes a long time. i dont like singing while sitting either. it makes it so hard. i like blocking though. walking around and actually acting. movin and shakin. bah.

i thought i looked nice today, which raised my self esteem which made it a little better. and i got a 93 on hannigan's bullshit test. fuck yea. i cant believe it, i almost had to pinch myself.

so... im not going to recap the weekend. no need. everyone already has. i will only say that play is out of control. and mike and i built a trellis. done. nice life lex.

saturday was the first full run-through/dress rehearsal. it was fabulous. we all fucked up our lines, gina was called a small elephant by ms. reynolds, there was some stealing of milk by a party who i will not name, and my boobs were suffocated. its going to be impossible to wear that dress. i feel violated in it, blagh! ms. reynolds is a total and utter bitch too. not only did she call gina a small elephant, she told me to steal (yes you heard correctly, steal!!!) a trellis and basically quit at the end of the play(she stormed out of the auditorium and peeled out of the high school lot), not to mention she told brittany/ britney (from canada) that she was only doing this for the money. good to know. by the way ""brittney"" has been a huge help in the play. she has a lot of creative ideas and its nice to work with someone who has an idea about stage and such. anyway, we caught everything on video tape, fucking hilaaaaaarrrrious.

bored and tired and procrastinating. not a good combination. and everyone is at the hockey game and i couldn't go for like the 80 billionth time. whatever they are probably having fun, having some time off from lexie. she's sooo annoying!!

NEWS FLASH! my boobs are in a lot of pain. the bra i have to wear for the play is like 2 sizes to small and it squeezes my sides and such. 

enough about that nightmare. mike and i built a fucking trellis for it. hells yes its pretty sweet, but it tilts to one side, sad. it looks good though and it has $25 worth of fake flowers on it, Gina helped pick them out and all.

i want to go luging again. in the dark. where the sex offenders and killers have a better chance of snatching me and stringing me up in a tree. oh that was terribly cynical and i apologize. i have been trying to be less cynical, carmie told me to. have i been successful? not at all.

"event","i have been depressing myself lately. i think im becoming one of those boring people with cardboard personalities. and i think im becoming less and less dependable, which is not what i want to be. dependable in the sense that i'll say i'll do something then neverrrrr do it. which is lame. i also gained 3 pounds since tuesday. at this rate, im going to be a boat.

yesterday was a snowday. woot. kath came over and we goofed around. we attempted to bake this p-i-m-p cake. but it was offended when we said it tasted like a big sugar cookie so it didnt bake for us. i think it was in the oven for 2 1/2 hours. which is deffinitely tooooo long. :( boo. we'll make another one later. for that oh so special occasion.  but im all caked out for now.

i want to go shopping so bad. its become an addiction. i see something i like and i HAVE to have it. there is no getting around it. im terrible. i spend money like it means nothing. i dont even have a spare 20 for gas. which is deffinitely sad. 

my left foot is asleep. its burning.

i downloaded some ani last night, which made my night.

today was hanni's bday.i wanted to go to battle of the bands tonight, unfortunately she was born.  she got some god loot too; some of the best movies in the world, new chuck's, etc. she got a figgen iPod Shuffle, which is like an iPod but $100 dollars less. still, its super nice. not to complain but i didnt even get a cake on my birthday. not all children are created equal. kidding. i cant hate hanni. i love my little banani head. 

this entry is long. today was wednesday's schedule. which bloooooowwwsss. i need another study in the AM im too tired. i seriously feel like i got hit head on by a truck. i shouldnt say that... poor daddy. 

oh shit, i hate days like this, where you hear a song and start crying. fuuuckk me. kristen's bday is tomorrow, but she left today. we'll have to celebrate it later. goodnight. im exhausted. i hate school. and 97% of the people in it. 

any one have any fun ideas? or does someone want to give me a good slap. i need a duffing."

its still snowing. i love snow. i want to go for a snow walk. a snow trek! a snow <strong>adventure</strong>! so the poetry page is up, with three poems on it. im just picking them from random diary entries because i seem to have misplaced a notebook that i used to write poetry in. 

anyways, make your comments and tell me what you think. 

maybe i will get up. im think of not showering.. because im lazy and i showered yesterday. and i dont smell.. in fact i smell like sun-ripened raspberries.  mom bought me a sweater from Shack's yesterday, its blue and cashmere and nice. im going to wear it today. with a pair of ripped jeans. cute. i'm guessing there is no indoor game today, even if there was i might not go. im still sore from pilates. oh thats a funny story:

on friday my mother made an appt for me with deb cookish for pilates bcause its <em>supposed</em> to help my scolioli. well <strong>scolioli ravioli</strong> is all i have to say to that! but surprisingly, pilates was really pretty fun. and some of it was really hard. i have a tendency to drop my head when im in an all fours position, but that puts strain on my neck and im not supposed to do that... i guess we are going to try to strengthen the other side of my back to straighten it out.. i dont exactly know which side is supposed to be stronger. haha! oh well! mother daughter bonding time is i think what my mom was looking for.. sad.

slumber party chez moi on sunday. cathleeny came down and visited, poor girl probably wanted to shoot herself. but it was fun and everyone liked you cathleen! the boys were over for a while, then they went home... the girls watched fame and then fell asleep at various hours in the night. we watched freaky friday... you are looking at the #1 anti-lindsey lohan fan right here, no point in asking why we watched it though because im going to tell you. Vanessa.

well maybe i wont die, but my ego will be shot. no more fun loving confident lexie. nope she'll be a sniveling little runt who cant even look people straight in the face. im going to have to change my picture to one of me not looking the camera in the face.  the camera has a face???? oh man i must be tired.

went to newbury yesterday. bought garden state and a bday card for hanni banani. guess who i saw. none other than the illustrious kyle jacques! i hadn't seen him since this summer so that was terrific. i was psyched. except i think that i scared him away because i didnt say much, i was just feeling somewhat out of sorts.. i guess. but i miss talking to him, he was a good talker.

"event","ok changed it again, what do you think? Je pense qu'il est beau! i like the poppies as more of a background than a user pic. yay! oh the cleverness of me. 

anyways, mostly what i wanted to say in this entry was basically to defend our play which is sad and pathetic but i am prepared to do it. i have heard lots of complaining and i cant say that i havent been to blame for some of it, but today i really had a good think about it. last year about this time when we were first settling on what we would do for our sophomore competitive class play we were not very happy with the play on the first reading, but we made it fun during the course of the play. the plot sucked but the characters were funny and we had fun doing it and thats all that matters. this year, ok so maybe we dont exactly have a perfect cast, or a lot of action, but the lines are funny and we can make this play fun by getting into it. changing our play this late is a dumb idea. what can we accomplish by kicking reynolds out and changing the play and recasting and all? nothing its just a waste of time because no matter what all of these 45 minute plays suck because they are only 45 minutes. the best we can do is just to take what we have and make it fun. if the stagecrew comes up with inventive ideas for the set and all of the actors work hard with each other in coaching each other through the lines, then it will end up being a lot of fun. apple-throwing doesnt make play, it makes us look like a bunch of children who need supervision backstage because we have no self control. its jsut so frusterating because everyone is making the play look bad and bringing everyone down with it. i think the plot is dumb, too, because it is too much to handle in that short amount of time but its what we have and i deffinitely think people will understand and think its funny. we just need to make it fun. so all i have to say to those""this play is going to blow/ reynolds should step down/why dont we raise a revolt and protest against this play"" slackers is just let it go, sometimes you need to make the best of what you have and find the good in it.

thats all, fin"

"event","i just had a depressing thought. i was reading someone's lj, i will not specify their name just because i am lazy like that and it was all fun and cool, like how i could never get mine because i do not have the techno skills for that kind of stuff and i realized that they had so many comments. all were people i didnt recognize. i dont know why i expected to recognize any of them, but maybe i expected to recognize one. i dont know, either way it got me thinking about if i am ever going to get out of here. like the dreams im chasing are pretty fast. you have to catch them at the right moment and what if i miss it and become a failure. i have a plan b, but its also something that isn't exactly stable. more than anything i want to be onstage, but what if i dont do it. like what if im just not the right person for it, like the girl in Fame who had been a ballet dancer all her life, then junior year, her teacher tells her that she just doesnt have it. what if i jsut dont have it. i mean i can make it here in lunenburg i guess. but what about in Boston, NY London, Paris. its just a lot to live up to and i feel like im falling just this {} short of the grade, you know?

i dont know, it just brought me down thinking about never getting out of here and if i do, having to do it alone. then i was talking to someone a few nights ago, i forget who and they were talking about how, when you leave for college you lose all of your high school friends. i just cant imagine that happening. i mean, i love my friends more than my own family sometimes and i dont know why i would ever lose them because they mean so much to me. how could anyone just fall out fo touch with the person they spent their childhood with? it boggles my mind. 

im sorry i dont mean to bore you all ( as if there really was an audience reading this). i guess this was just for me, just to get it out and have it be somewhere but not have to write it in my real journal, its too depressing for it. im wondering about all the questions i still have and if they ever get answered. like what am i doing here? is there some purpose i am supposed to fulfill, i know i have one that i would like to fulfill but am i supposed to fulfill that specific one. or is there not a divine plan at all? are we jsut floating around out here with no guidance or direction. maybe im just going insane from all these Airborne/ Cold-eeze/ tylenol extra strength cold medicines im on. either way...

"event","ooh yay for comp. class plays! the auditions were today... only two people tried out for gwendolen, yay for me! j'ai le role! i hope i so really well. like super duper well. if we win i will be ecstatic and even if we dont win, it'll be fine. just so long as a certain class doesn't win, i will be happy. but enough about that sad topic...

RSAC today! what a joke! i really do love going there. for the first like 20 minutes i just want to shoot myself, but once we get in our workgroups and get brainstorming, then its so much fun. Samantha, who is our subgroup chair, is such a sweetie and she's soooo funny. we were talking about sex ed in schools and how msot sex ed courses are flawed and she said, "" you guys know how we learn about how its ok for guys to masturbate and explore themselves and how they do it at a younger age, but female masturbation is never touched on."" at this point the group is rolling on the floor in tears. ooh she is a funny one, so we talked about female masturbation and such for a while then decided that it would be irrelevant to what we were doing and moved on. oh joy to the world, we can now all masturbate with freedom... and anything else that gets us going, i suppose. haha i just thought about vanessa for a moment there, ""dont worry guys i brought the petroleum jelly!"" nuggs and her lube, together at last...

enough of that. i learned a joke at RSAC today, wanna hear it? well you can read it at least. what do you see when the pillsbury dough boy bends over... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... DOUGH NUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sara and Mike sort of steal it from me when im supposed to be guarding it with my life for Theresa while she and Nat did whatever. When T and N come back, Sara and Mike had stolen many a nerd and were playing suck the nerds from each others' mouth. i almost burst out laughing/ screaming obscenities/ gauging my eyes out and other various activities. but i restrained myself. tomorrow is Napoleon Dynamite during double yearbook. wahhoo!!!! 

i wish i had something really funny to write about but i dont. nothing really exciting happened today, except that half the faculty was still out recovering from their New Year's Festivities. i was Cherrier- and Short-less all day, it was wonderful. especially because math makes me cry. you know that feeling when you are so frusterated you cant think and you just want to breakdown in a sobbing mess. yea i get that feeling everytime i step into Short's class. thank you mr. trodello for fucking up my math career foreverrrrr!!! so now i go to trig and im like ""hi, yea, i dont know what we're talking about""

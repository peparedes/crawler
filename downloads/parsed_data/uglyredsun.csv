"event","Time for an update; past, present and future.

<b>The Past;</b> Well I've moved out. And I've graduated. The latter piece of info seems a bit lost in the mix due to the former. In June, I was told to find somewhere else to live due to Claire wanting her flat back (which is fair enough since it is her's). Having just finished my uni exams and stuff, and considering my future (re. career/studying etc) this was pretty awful timing. It sort of pushed me into two actions; 1) find a liveable flat as soon as possible and 2) find a bearable full-time job. I had mixed results.

Moved out, relatively quickly, with Ewan and Dyno. They're cool, the flat is really nice, affordable and in a good area - really close to town and thus close to pretty much everything I need. I don't have a big room where I can hide any more. I do have a lounge where we can socialize. A daunting prospect. Feel it's been good for me to share my do-nothing time with others. I sort-of had that in the old flat and sort of didn't. It has its drawbacks as I can't just crawl into my own world, in my room, now; it's too small and uncomfortable. As I said though, other people are good for me, just not when I'm in a difficult mood. 

The job front has been a bit messier. I was working for the Taxi Office until Sept. This was part time though, obviously I had to find some other work, some full time work, immediately. I had a bit of a hard time with due to issues (some beyond my control, some within). Eventually thanks to Mick, I got a full time position working in the kitchen of TGI Fridays. I was pretty enthusiastic about this but looking back I think I was just more enthusiastic about changing jobs and relieved to have found a full time job. It didn't work out though. I've gone on about TGI's far too much recently so I'll just say it wasn't the right environment for me, I couldn't cope. I regretted leaving the Taxi firm for a number of reasons; working full time for TGI was only marginally better financially than part time at the Taxis; I realized how easy I had it in my previous job; I actually missed the people and the environment. That brings us to the present, I guess.

<b>The present;</b> After handing my notice into TGI's, and numerous seemingly unsuccessful job interviews, CV distribution drives (what?) and application forms, I'm back at the Taxi company through a fortunate twist of fate. I phoned for a taxi! Jenny-lee answered, joked about me coming back and we went from there. The thing is now, I'm working full time, which is what I wanted in the first place! I was so relieved to be back. I still am, really. I could feel the proverbial walls closing in around me. So, as I said, I'm back where I started and extremely relieved to be there. I don't really feel embarrassed about going back, its beyond that, I'm going back to a better situation for me, to a job I did well, to some security most importantly. So what now?

<b>The Future; </b>Nothing's changed. I still want to teach English overseas. To do this requires a fair bit of cash. At this point in time I am down to the last pennies, near enough. This last month has been horrific in terms of income; TGI's take the piss re. getting wages out to employees in time. Doesn't look like I'm getting my laying time time either. I look forward to cutting all ties on Friday when (if?) I receive my final wage. All this is irrelevant though, I need a long term plan. This plan looks something like; work. work. work. Get some money saved, then next summer do a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) course before hopefully finding work in a field I think I could do well, in a position in I want to be. Since graduating, a lot has happened. I haven't had time to consider my long term path as far as career goes, I sort of had to find the best short term plan (and I lucked out with the flat / mates). So, now I have some stability, I see somewhere I want to be (abroad!), I see something I want to do. It's in my hands now. I get frustrated and upset when I have no plan or path to follow, that's why the last few months have been the worst of my life in some respects. I look forward now to staying on course!


Cheers, this was for no-one in particular. Needed to get some clarity and perspective."

"event","I'm posting this here because too many people read my Facebook. Oh God, what an opening line...

I'm depressed. 

I'm very unhappy with my life. I feel insignificant. I feel like I can't make any positive changes to my situation. I can't find a full time job. I've been consistently rejected and the reasons, they vary, they cut. I hate how I'm living. I'm not living. I'm renting a soul.

A year a go, I had it made. I loved my life. I want to go back there. Everything suited. Huge room (better than big flat, more on this later), Jenny as a flatmate is far better and less detrimental to my health than Dyno, less snipey than Ewan. I was working on 12, 000 words of misery. I spent a lot of hours on my dissertation. I'd gladly do another to turn back the clock.

I'm not suicidal, don't get me wrong. I'm not at all. I realize saying this raises red flags. I just now understand why young people, young men, at my age, feel like they have no other choice. For the first time in my life, I understand. As I said, I'm not. I'm in a rut and all it takes is some twist of luck or fate, or some twist by my hand to turn my life around. I just, I understand that constant stream of claustrophobia, the web, the tightening of the noose and the asphyxiating nature of life and chasing a career. Many can't deal. I can, given the chance.

I'm 25 in 2 weeks. Less than two weeks. I cant act like a dickhead and climb things, fight things, make an arse of myself every weekend. I did, but I can't any more. I need to fucking grow up, be a man. I wake up sometimes, cringing at the shite I've done.


I've decided to change my tone towards some people. If you find me absent, I am. If we are in a critical conversation, I will flat out refuse to acknowledge the situation. 

In short, I'm tired of this. I'm tired of this charade. I need stability and a new mentality. I'll take it now. 

Don't think the irony of posting this whiney Livejournal post on Livejournal is lost on me."

Been to the doctors, had a haircut, booked a dentist appointment, done the big weekly shop, bought some books, been to the library and done a washing. It's only 2pm! Contrast this with yesterday where I was in my bed until 2pm.

"event","I hate Christmas 

I don't really, but I'm getting there.

This year, Christmas fell around the end of December, a week prior to the annual New Years Day celebrations. I celebrated it thusly. On Christmas Eve I did nothing. This was fine, as the day before I was out. 23rd December was Twilight Sad at King Tutt's with Jenny and Malcolm. Fun time was had as this was officially the beginning of Christmas Festivities, so I had a few bottles of Resolutions beer. The woman in the off license had to go through a Pure Effort to get me this beer but, worth it. Anyway, Twilight Sad were blow away, as you'd expect. Purchased a T-shirt and hit the road... to Nice N Sleazys. Had some drinks there, Pete and Ian arrived and the idea of staying out was tossed about, before eventually rejected. Homeward. 

As I'd said, Christmas Eve held no shenanigans. I think I was actually all alone in the flat. Sob sob sob. Fine with it though as I had to get up early and be able to endure my family all day, which is no mean feat. 

Christmas Day begun with meeting my dad in the Gorbals before going to the pub, with my brother. He wasn't drinking as he was on tablets, but my father and I got quite festively drunk, as we are allowed to. After about 212 'one for the road's and meeting some guy I'd gone to primary school with, we left the pub for my gran's. Once there, she stuffed us with Christmas food. I don't remember what I ate, it was brown and mushy. Tasty, regardless. Then my uncle gave my brother and I a lift to my mother's house in Rutherglen. More vague food, more alcohol and some presents! Eventually I got a taxi back home at 11pm before crashing out here. Quietus. 

Actually went out, actually existed, on the Friday, Boxing Day. Lots of fun. Lots of people out. Saturday was the same, though much more drawn out, due to the Old Firm game (12.30pm) and UFC (3am Sunday morning). I sneaked a nap in there so I didn't Pure Die by the time UFC rolled around. Dyno was the highlight of the night as per usual, trying to mack on some burd. Wideo dyno! 

Skip to New Year. Ok. We had a party. It was fun. Short sentences. Punchy. Lots of people arrived, made a hell of a mess. This is fine, it's NY eve and all that. We knew what we were letting ourselves in for. Not happy with the pricks stealing my iPod (assumedly, it's gone missing) and the fight (nor the graffiti in the close...) 

So that's the framework of the last two weeks. Except not, because this time of year has no frame-work. No plan. That's the crux of my annoyance with it. For two weeks nearly, everything shuts down. Shops, routines, travel etc. All dead. I can't cope without a plan. Without a 'next step'. I get frustrated and restless when left to my own accord or without my daily / weekly schedule. New Year was a fucking relief. In fact, no, 3rd January is the relief, 'coz that seems to be the acceptable time where everyone can face the fact that, ""Christmas is over, lets move on."" Let's pure heavy exist now. It's like this two week period has been one long weekend. Not because I've been drinking a lot through it, 'coz I haven't, but because, with a weekend, I can take the insanity of Friday / Saturday knowing that after using Sunday to recover, I can come back alive on Monday. I know where I stand - I go to work, I go shopping, I do the dishes. I revel in the mundane details. 3rd January is my Monday (incidentally, it's a Saturday)."

"event","London Calling and (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.

Hated, I'm sure, by idiots. These are the type of songs which originally resonate with a large number of people but themselves become, customs, institutions and eventually fossilized punchlines. The thing that separates these two songs from 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and 'Goin' Underground' is that their unique rhythm brings them back into the fore of 'genuinely great music'. London Calling itself has this searing bass-line and those threatening quacks towards the end. I wasn't alive then but this song, judging by its longevity, seems to accurately portray an awful, backlash-esque vein of public opinion. 

(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction needs no defence, that riff speaks louder than anyone ever could."

I don't mind, the song is fucking sublime, but the lyrics, fuck, mindblowing. 

On with the show. The song is Poke by Frightened Rabbit. 


Poke at my iris
Why can't I cry about this?
Maybe there is something that you know that I don't?

We adopt a brand new language
Communicate through pursed lips
and you try not to put on any sexy clothes or graces

I might never catch a mouse
And present it in my mouth
To make you feel you're with someone who deserves to be with you

And there's one thing we've got going
And it's the only thing worth knowing
Its got lots to do with magnets and the pull of the moon

Why wont our love keel over
as it chokes on a bone
<b>We can mourn it's passing and then bury it in snow</b>

Or should we kick its cunt in?
And watch it dies bleeding
If you don't want to be with me just say and I will go

We can change our partners
This is a progressive dance
But remember it was me who dragged you up to the sweaty floor
 
But like a drunken night... its the best bits that are coloured in
But like a drunken night, it's the best bits that are coloured in 
but like a drunken night its the best bits that are coloured in

Should look through some old photos
I adored you in every one of those
If someone took a picture of us now they'd need to be told

That we had ever clung and tied
And maybe not with arms at night
""I'd say she was his sister but she doesn't have his nose""

And now we're unrelated
And rid of all the shit we heed
But I hate when I feel like this and I never hated you

Honestly, there's about 312 lines that are so perfect. The lyrics don't speak to any situation I'm in right now but still, even from 'the outside', they're touching. Beautifully drafted sentimentality, with a wry hint of Glaswegian homely-ness. Just perfect. 

I dislike using icons and lyrics to define me, as I've done so many times (and continue to). I want me to represent me. It's not hiding, but using iconography (album covers etc) doesn't feel right any more. I am me and I want to use myself and things I create (there are few) to represent me on the Internet. I see the point in using a special album cover, or movie, to identify yourself. I do it, and still will, but I, well, I dunno. I can't explain. I bought posters but as soon as they arrived, I thought 'you are not this artwork'. Tempted to put them up backwards. Haha, pure 17 year old 'individualism' mentality here. Maybe it was seeing Jennie's picture on the fridge. I've never considered that. This is rambling now (now, he says!) but its cathartic for me. There's nothing I need to say or get off my chest, so to speak (or not to, as the case is), but... 

Anyway. 

This livejournal update was sober-powered. Call it a change of direction.

I'll leave you with the short version of this post; listen to Poke by Frightened Rabbit."

I can see for miles.


Today I had a bit of a fucking frozen-with-fear moment. Quite ridiculous really. I woke up and the first thing I started thinking was ""what do I do after I graduate?"". Legit sat in bed panicking about 'what next?'. Fucking Hell. It's conscientious to have an eye on the (not so distant) future but Sunday mornings should be sacred. So says big Jay Cee anyway. 

I think the worry stems from - as always - my misunderstanding of something. I've been working (reading) on my dissertation this week. This is because I've got to do my 2, 000 word proposal for it by Thursday. Now, I've been panicking about THIS because, well, I've never done a dissertation before and have had very little guidance from my advisor. Today, in work, I was going over my notes and I noticed that my proposal is due in mid DECEMBER! Not mid November as I had thought! Fucking relief. I feel like I've got two benefits from this. First off, I've had a bit of a kick up the arse in terms of ""GET WORKING ON YER DISSERTATION!"", which I did need. Secondly, I now have a bit of breathing space, and some time to compose myself and work on my ideas. 

I don't have much else today. I don't have much."

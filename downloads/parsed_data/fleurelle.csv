he said it would be ready today.
i want to close this deal.
and there it was, all fixed, sodered on instead of glue.
the flawed jewel back home in the crown.
i sat in my car and slipped it on
pushing past the knuckle that 
makes it all the more difficult to take off
exactly as the bell from a church tower across the street
was ringing its half-past chime."

"event","the jewelry man
a face i have been getting to know from the million times i've had to ring him at the door and wait for the buzzer.
he never recognizes me though
he's old
i have to explain why i'm there each time and then it jogs his memory and he knows the whole story.
again today
i went to pick it up from him
after my dream the last time.  the dream that it was fixed ""wrong.""  the dream i chastised myself inside my head for having - ""can't i dream about something else??""
then i realized it was because it was true
it was wrong
the stone in the crown was gone
gone
fuck
find it you old man, you.
""it must have came out during the polishing, I'll have my guy look for it and if we can't find it, we'll put in another one""
""I'll be back next week"" i say.
i leave to ponder the idea of having a ""new"" stone put in.  
today, it's next week and i ring the door and wait for the buzzer.
once again, i tell him I'm here to pick it up.
""oh, I don't have it yet but my guy found the stone on the floor in the corner of the workshop""
that poor little stone crying by itself all lost off the crown.
""i'll be back"" i said again for the millionth time."

"event","i found a little jewel bag in an old coat pocket.
it was time to dig it out of the dirt.
so i did.
i put it in the little bag. then in my drawer.
done.

this morning i grabbed the bag and took it out.
i put it on.
i asked myself ""why?"" and didn't have the answer.
because i'm strong? because i'm weak?
i'm strong.

i looked at it surveying the earth that still stuck between it's crevices.
i should polish it up.
sanitize it?
no the dirt did that.

i grabbed more stuff, ready to go out the door.
and it brushed across my sweater in my haste.
i heard a tinkling thud.
the gem came out and landed on the floor.
hmmmmm. *what* did *that* mean?
is he ok?  think.  yes, he's ok.

it means i'm taking it in to get it polished up."

"event","out of my hair
little tiny yellows ones that fell from the tree
i was sitting under when i read a book
during lunchtime at a park
on a busy streetcorner
with lots of distractions
like the motorcycle cop who gave a ticket to a driver 
in a bmw
then the cop was stuck there b/c his bike wouldn't start
ha ha
also, the crazy man with the shopping cart who carried
on a conversation with the air about ""stealing"" and
how ""because you're new here"" he was explaining that 
you shouldn't ever even steal a gumball.
his voice had the same authority that any other mojo
with a handsfree cell phone had when browsing thru
the supermarket aisle.
and when i returned form the park
i saw a car parked on the street by my building
 - white tennis shoe car with blue racing stripes -
it was the exact same car that jimmy john used to drive
when i was 16 and we made love
in that car
stripping out of our togas after the party
thinking nobody knew but somehow
my boyfriend found out
and my exboyfriend found out too
but they didn't want to give up their friendship with jimmy john
because he was too cool
so he got to keep me.
we were incestous with the same last name, jackson.
but then he got too slutty
he was no longer a catch for my fancy
he made love in that car to renee
outside my house
she had borrowed my dress that night
and she fucked jimmy john outside of my house in it.
nevermind
i was long bored with him
poor confused jimmy john and his rockabilly band
he became a slut."

"event","If I was to update this journal today, i would write something really lame about wanting to lay around on pillows, having someone's loving arms around me, kissing my forehead and nuzzling my ear.

It would be a really sappy diary entry akin to a young and wistful girl who didn't have a care in the world but to be princessed.

It would be blase and cliche and would amount to feeding a regurgitated fantasy already lived out.

I would end the entry  with ""I believe in love"" or someother bumper sticker mentality. and draw pictures of hearts and flowers and sunshine and rainbows and puffy clouds."

"event","It was now, not a question
It was the answer he didn't want 
Nothing could possess the strong feelings he had for her
Nothing could stop her loving caress

It belonged to him more than the shoes he wore,
For many years without change.
She walked in him as grace endears herself
To the one she puts her gaze to.

The moment of realization slapped him 
Across the chin and stung like a black wasp.
All the wine from an everlasting chalice
Was not enough to pour into the soles his feet danced upon.

Her love was too pure to drink from
It would sour his putrefied well from which he pulled 
Muck and pasted it to the other ladies
Like clay on a stone mold.

Peeling away into a denial,
Staring at the trinkets strewn about for interest sake,
She left him striding with cold women
To find comfort in his bare feet."

"event","Dear Lord,
Please show me how to help my dear friend refrain from making cut marks all over her body.  

If it is pain that makes her feel alive, lord, can you please send her my toothache?  Give her the toothache and a pint of icecream. Make it chocolate fudge icecream so she cannot resist.  Let her delight in the pain that rushes through her body every time she puts the spoon in her mouth, making every part of her feel alive with a piercing twinge of ""eeeoooow"" pulsating her nerves to stand at attention.  Release her of the duty of physical selfflagellation and bless her with sensitive gums and a fresh new cavity in her lower left back molar to be exact.

Dear lord, if you give her my toothache, she can be released of all other self indulgent manifestations of anger inside her and can go about her business of life with a bad tooth.

thank you."

"event","i had a dream last night from 11:00pm to midnight.  I know the time b/c i had to set the alarm to midnight so i could wake up saxon since he wacked his head on the kitchen hutch, had a giant lump on his forehead and I needed to wake him up all night long incase he had a concussion.

in my dream i went to visit a friend.  he was living at his parent's house.  the house was loaded with pinball machines and basketball hoops and other fun stuff that you might win on ""A Price is Right"" if you're wearing the right t-shirt.

in my dream it was nice to spend time with my friend but i had my kids there and they all started falling asleep on sheepskin rugs that were laid about in the bathroom.  even though i had said goodbye to my friend, i decided not to leave because the children were so peaceful and b/c saxon had hit his head i needed to watch over him, laying peacful on the sheepskin.

so i woke up my friend who was passed out on a green couch in the garage to tell him i was still there.  he was disoriented and said ""who's there?"" and i realized it's because i was wearing cateye glasses so i laughed and said it was only me.

just then, his dad came in.  he was jovial, maybe drunk, and i realized that his dad only had one arm but i didn't ask how it had happened.

my friend got up and said he wanted to show me something.  he took me to a rabbit hutch and opened up a drawer and there were little bunnies sleeping in a mound, soft and fluffy.  

then the alarm went off at midnight."

I don't think the pain will ever fully fade, and maybe that's just how it is when you lose someone close to you, even if it's a love/hate relationship.
It's not something that you can easily come to terms with, even though the fact of the matter is that they're dead, forever, and nothing you can ever do will ever change that.
It's just how it is.
Perhaps it's because it's within the formative years, even if it's towards the end of them?
You can never impart how important this would be to someone else. It's not really something that many can understand unless they're in a similar situation and even then it's only sympathy, not understanding.
Every situation is different.

I just hope that maybe, now that his pain is (hopefully) over with forever, it is better than the pain he went through while in life.

And that I can somehow honor his memory and the effort towards nurturing me (however twisted the attempts may have been) and make something of myself.
Maybe he's now in peace.

I think it's probably a little early for a person to have their father die for someone in this kind of culture, but that's just something I gotta deal with, and nothing that I can probably ever ... I dunno.
I'm just gonna end this post now.
Nothing I can say, Nothing I can do.
This is just for catharsis, and I'm sure it won't serve as a lesson for anyone else.
But, if it were my place, I'd beg all people who are distant from their parents to please rectify the situation some way and make things good while they still can, because once they die you never get that chance ever again. It's a closed book, and a brutal reality.

Even if he sucked as my father, he was still as good a person as he could be, given the circumstances, and I've always loved him, no matter what.

R.I.P.

Most love to Sid's parents for when it first happened. They're still in my memories. Love forever to those who supported me during then."

"event","I can't help but have an overwhelming feeling of being a feckless wastrel.
Perhaps because I am.
I know I usually say ""Oh, I'll accomplish something, I'm sure, just wait and see,"" except it is usually said with more conviction, to fool others if not myself as well.
But I really have achieved more lately.
I've quit smoking, I no longer binge-drink, and rarely drink at all.
I am getting paid for oddjobs here and there, and will get a steady job soon.
I pay rent and pay for my own food now, and the gas that I use in my car.
Not as stagnant as I used to be.

But I feel like it is not enough. The mistakes I've made in the past were too costly, and set me back so far. I feel like I should have my associates degree within 6 months from now, move to Virginia before winter, and get my own place there, as well as fully own my car.
The first part probably won't happen, the second may, the third would have to if the second did, and the fourth one may as well.

I agonized a bit over the moving issue with one of my friends.
I thought out loud ""But if I move, it will set me back that much more from getting my degree.""
And the question posed back to me was ""Think about your priorities. Would you rather get by, and enjoy life with your friends, or maybe make money hand over fist, but have no joy in life?""
It caught me off guard. I think my values have slowly warped over the years. They've always been with friends first. Many times at my own expense. But to realize that I am confused over the friends vs money matter was startling.

Does it mean I am becoming more realistic and coming into adulthood now? Or does it mean that I am forsaking values that I have kept all my life because they are no longer convenient?
I don't know, and it is probably not that big of a deal. Over-analyzation as always.

I've also realized that I've had the better part of a year pass me by since my last love interest, and that I haven't wanted anyone since then.
Not truly.

Maybe it is all connected. Perhaps I am becoming more self-centered? My loss of interest in females as anything more than perhaps sex objects (irony) or friends and my further lack of dedication towards friends are signs of self-absorption.
But maybe none of my friends that I am speaking of were ever truly dedicated towards me.
Maybe the fact that I many times feel like I am a feckless wastrel is because I've always been a feckless wastrel, more or less, and that self-centeredness is not something new, but merely has increased.

I could sure go for a damn joint and some alcohol right about now.
A day late on that. Ha.
By the way, ignore this post.
Thanks."

I cheered someone up that really needed it.
I think perhaps, as I've thought before, that is what I am to do.
As ironic as that may sound, the King of Melancholy and Captain of Apathy is to make others happy.
Maybe in this way I can feel a bit of the something that I give to them, although I have little of it to give in the first place.
Hrm.

She was very sad. I bought her some pumpkin, chocolate chip cookies.
That apparently made her day. Just some sweet, small gesture as that.
Making her day only cost me $3.99. It was well worth it.

On the other hand, my sister's car has been stolen. Which means my car, which is already trying to die, will be rode into the ground. Wee.
It's apparently fine, but we'll see. It was doing some crazy shit before.


The thought of her still haunts me.
It both haunts and taunts. I don't understand this.
I realized today that the thirteenth is soon coming up.
A friday the 13th to be exact.
My mouth dropped in shock when I connected that with months ago.
Days, years. Months. It doesn't matter how long ago. I will remember it.
Just as I do the others.

I reflected back on the things I have said to her. Some of them were downright harsh. Perhaps truthful. Perhaps not. The intention behind the words, the spirit of them, though, is caustic.
For two reasons:
The animosity towards her alone poisoned me.
And because some of the things that I said while thinking of her I could've been saying while standing in front of a mirror.

That seems to be the case most of the time.

I've once gone so far as to say I am everyone and no one.
Another facet of that insidious disorder.

However, I've said that I would never talk to her again.
I suppose I should stick by this.
If not for integrity, than for myself. And if not for myself, than for her.



These days seem somewhat lonely.
I find myself fascinated and captivated as things move to a slow pace. Almost a stand-still.
A still-frame of my surroundings.
Or perhaps that these things move so quickly and are so cyclic that blinking does nothing to obscure even for a moment what is going on, because it is all the same. I think it to be the other, though.
A crawl, to be sure.

It was apparently only nine days since I got a call.
I either didn't notice it, paid no attention to it, or time has certainly become molasses.

I always seem to have a surplus of Klonopin.
I can fix that."

I spoke to someone else about that lately. ""Resonance"" in a relationship that you have with someone. Family, friends, significant other. Whatever.

She should stop hanging out with her kids and hang out with some adults...I dunno.

I get more tired as each day goes by. I can barely hang on.
I almost decided to say I was sick and leave for home early.
SO tired. I don't know why. I think I get an ok amount of sleep.
I'm starting to eat better (more often) now, so I don't know why I'm getting more tired. That makes no sense.
I guess I'll figure it out...

They have me working every day this week. Fuckers. Eight hours a day, or don't waste my time. Christ.
Plus they haven't promoted me yet like they said they would. If they don't start making good on that promise within a week or two, I'll start looking for a job. If I find one before they get me scheduled for training, I'm quitting. Simple as that. I'm not going to be someone they lie to. They can eat it, because if I leave, they'll realize how bad they really needed me, and piss their pants whenever it starts getting busy.
I'm not wasting my time on these shitheads. I got money to make, goals to accomplish, dreams to realize. These suckers can lick the shit off my dick if they think that they'll get in the way of these things and that I'll stand by and twiddle my fucking thumbs.

Chick at work keeps flirting with me. Pretty much the hottest one there. She's Christian, but I'm not looking for a relationship, so that shouldn't be a problem. She keeps telling me about how she's got a hangover when she comes into work. I recently started suggesting we drink and hang out together. She replied ""Well, come on over.""
Fuck, yes.
Even if I don't do shit with her, that would be a major ego boost to just dangle that girl around. But who knows what I'll do. I'll decide once the situation arises, if it does. It might not even be like I think it is, so yeah, we'll see.
I doubt I'd do something like that. Although I also don't know how likely it is for me to be a man-whore. She is pretty hot, but I've never really done anything like that, and always found it to be...not me - To fuck a chick over, especially when it comes to sex. But...hey, if we're drinking and having a good time, and she's been flirting with me, I doubt she's looking for a serious relationship, and knows exactly what to expect.

Again, we'll see.

I need to start taking my studying seriously. Because that's my ticket to wherever it is I wanna be. So that's what's going to happen.

I had been told that this was her intent beforehand.
So much for grace. Not that she ever aimed for it anyways.

I was gonna go out to the movies tonight, but everyone was too damn broke.
Or I was left out because a particular person that I don't like (and she in turn doesn't like me) was going to go as well.
Doesn't matter.
One of the other guys that was going to go make me uncomfortable with his psychotically-overboard flameness. Not that I'm not secure in my own sexuality, but that his constant flirting with me in a serious manner is a little unnerving, especially since he's old enough to be my grandfather.

...Weird.

Also, some dude at work was going to catch a jumping by some other chodes.
One which I don't like, another which is a weirdo, and two other guys I don't know were going to jump him.
I told him, even though he filed the police report, if I saw them beating on him while I happened to be walking out into the parking lot that they would be in for a rude awakening in the form of elbows, fists, feet, and knees. Plus whatever I could get my hands on.

One-on-one is fine, but a jumping is fucking retarded, especially if it's a personal problem.
That's for pussies.
You might as well be hitting an eight year old girl, punk-bitches.

You got me tangled up in your web spun so well.
Your web of betrayal, of lies, of death, of hell.
I'm caught in your web, held fast, and I don't know how.

It was a fun time, Black Widow.
But I learned my way out.
And you won't hold me again.
Never will your web ensnare me again, my friend.

Your venemous mouth was too much,
And your bite a thousand deaths.
And if it wasn't Love, I'm still trying to catch my breath.
So what was it?

You've moved onto another meal, my dear Black Widow.
Better them than me."

Hopefully it's beauty will work it's magic.

Doubt it.

God.
Sometimes the thoughts that go through my mind are so taunting.
About myself.
When I think about the reasons behind the things I do, or the way I am.
Or the reasons behind not doing things.
It's maddening.

I'm so very tired.
I slept ten hours. I'm still very tired.
I don't even know if I can go, I'm so tired.
I'll just pass out at the wheel or fall asleep on the way there.
My eyelids feel kinda heavy.

I'm stuck in that rat maze.
Waiting to run into a mousetrap.
Searching for that cheese.
Don't know what that cheese looks like. But I can smell it.
I know I want it, whatever it is.
I hunger for it.
I follow it's haunting trail, unable to reach it directly, and unable to work my way through the maze to it.

I want either that cheese, or the mousetrap.
I don't want to continue wandering. It's one or the other.
Life or death.
Eros or Thanatos.
Yes, or no.

I'm so tired of it. The meaningless toil. The only meaning is pleasure right now, because that's the only meaning I can grasp.
Interesting choice of words."

People at work suck. Most of them anyways.

Tomorrow, I realized, I have all day off from everything...
except homework and studying. Study day, I guess.

I got paid yesterday.

I'm not going to bother with relationships. I've decided this.
The only person I'm ever going out with is Captain Morgan, etc.
An alcohol bottle is infinitely more reliable than a female.

You know what to expect. There is never any surprises.
You get exactly what you want out of it.
It will never violate your trust, or hurt your feelings.
And it makes you feel good.

Mmm...
Yeah. I found my lifemate.

Speaking of which, exercising while smashed is...awkward.


I just realized the majority of my journal entry was about alcohol, so I gotta add some more.

My telephone number book thingy is falling apart. Pages are coming out, numbers are old/no longer good, scratched out, or from people who I don't want to talk to anymore.

And my little scribblin' notebooks that should be full of out-pourings aren't.

There were several disgruntled customers today.
One of them was a fucking ex-convict that was pretty much threatening to throw down with me if one more tiny thing was wrong.
I walked away, calmly, and went in the back and chilled until I was ready to come back to the front.
I swear to fucking fuck that I wanted to break his face and lay him out in front of everyone. Fuck his tough man shit, he can try that shit on someone else. Jackass.

On a related topic, I'm thinking about buying a gun. Perhaps a .22 to start out. Who knows?

On the flip-side of that, I'm thinking about getting back into Chin-Na, which was part of my first training in Tai Chi, as it was taught to me. Pleh.

An addition to the songs on my music, I'm also now listening to HED p.e - Feel good.

I think I realized alot of the times the things that I do for people is really just for myself.
Because I care about whether or not I'm a ""bad"" person. I realized this when I noticed that I only help people when I feel like it. ""Well, everyone's like that. If you don't feel like it, you don't do it.""
No. I don't even care about their shit when I don't feel like it. I just brush them off.

OR maybe it's that when my needs are more ...imperative than usual, I tend to them without regard to anyone else's needs. Perhaps that's how everyone else is, and I'm just thinking about shit too much.

I've been feeling really tired lately. Physically, mentally...just everything. I'm tired of it. I'm exhausted, exasperated, and expectant. I just feel like the core of it is gone. I'm becoming some fucking drone. Doing the same thing, day in, day out, with not much to show for it, and not a lot of feelings to go around.
I think I've given too many out or something.
It's harder for me to justify giving a shit about things.

The days pass by, yet somehow can sometimes seem to drag on in such an agonizing manner.

It had something to do with purpose, and simplicity and complexity to explain the nature of things and how it was not necessarily dualistic in nature, because of the varying degrees of simplicity and complexity.
And with each individual/thing, the more complex or simple it was determined how well it functioned towards it's one purpose. Not that the person or thing could only have one purpose, but that it exists for one main purpose.

The more simplistic it was, or more specifically, the more consistent/coherent or same it was in it's operative and static nature, the better it would function in it's main purpose. The more complex, the more difficult it would be for it to do so (generalization).

Of course, I've forgotten much of it...
I didn't have pen and paper on handy, and was at work.

I'm sure it would make no sense in many scenarios, and thus be tossed in the trash, but I can sorta see where I was coming from with it....

Then the physical prison no longer matters. The broken, bleeding fist no longer matters. The pain, the reality doesn't matter.
Just the mental prison I've put myself in.

The Void. Lacking. Discontent. So decadent, yet none of it will satisfy.

There's always another way to be numb to...what? Nothing. Numb to the lack of something, or rather the effects of the inexistence of something substantial.

I don't know what it is exactly. I hear the word ""Love"" alot, but I don't know if that's what I'm sensing.
I think Love is kinda like a lost concept.
A long-lost civilization, or a dead language.
Part of pop culture, mentioned alot, even used frequently as an idea, but never spoken, never lived, never seen or practiced.
Falling in love with the idea of love, because it's foreign and romanticized.
The truth of love as a reality is just like other parts of life. A struggle.

And that's why people never attain it. Because they don't really want to. Love is just as sickening as everything else that disappoints them.

Realizing what love is can be likened to this scenario:

You wake up in the morning. Soft rays of light enter through your window, gently causing you to wake from your restful slumber. You trudge your way towards the refrigerator, looking for that perfect breakfast. Instead, the only thing that jumps out at you is milk. So you prepare yourself some cereal. Except there is no lucky charms. Just wheat chex. So you pour in the milk anyways, and lift your spoon up to take a bite, and the taste of sour milk explodes in your mouth, and you spit it out, disgusted and disappointed. You blame someone else for the spoiled milk and silently mutter to yourself as you pour it out.

This is how many people first experience love, but because it does not match what is in their head, they toss it away. They don't realize that you've got to get your fucking lazy ass up, and actually look for some fucking eggs, jelly, bread, butter, a frying pan, and a flipper, and actually fucking cook. Actually spread the god damned jelly on the buttered bread, and put it on a plate. And just maybe your milk won't be sour that time, along with the breakfast you actually put effort into. Idiot.

A lot of people, if they read this, would nod their head, totally unaware of themself, thinking ""I know someone just like that.""
Yeah. Themself.
I could continue on this rant, but it would go on forever, and I'll just ruin my day with venomous anger over how fucked up the many facets of our society are."

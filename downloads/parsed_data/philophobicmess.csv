Hi. I am Madison. I go to skool. I hart Ohio University. I do not hart another certain university which is too far away, not that it matters anyway...not much I can do, not much anyone is going to or wants to. I am stoopid and a female. My life is made up of those two facts. I make a living as a stalker. You'd be surprised how true that actually is. I like chocolate probably more than I like you. I wish on certain stars and on certain times but I don't think it's working.

"event","Okay, for those of you who don't know, I am going to be turning 19 on May 2nd. Thats about 8 days away. And I'm fully aware of the gift-giving process that occurs in America (and many other countries) for birthdays. So right now, I am going to make it easy on all of you and tell you exactly what I want from you:


I want a page. One page, NOT double spaced, free form, however you want to write it - About you. I want all of you to write an autobiography for me. It doesn't have to be extensive, it doesn't have to be well written (though I know some of you are going to go crazy with it). I just want at least one full page of your life.

I am going to put them all together in a three-ring binder. And I will be the ONLY one who sees them, unless you specify that it's okay that others see them. I would really appreciate it if you wrote more than just ""I was born, some stuff happened, and then more stuff happened."" I'd like to see some of the events that shaped your life, some of your favorite memories or worst memories, or really, just anything at all.

So, to clarify:
- At least one page (FEEL FREE TO DO MORE)
- Autobiography
- NOT double-spaced
- Size 12 or below font


I am going to be asking this for the rest of our lives, and I'm going to be collecting them and keeping them in this binder. This is really important to me; please don't blow it off.


Thank you.


P.S. If you had your heart set on getting me something awesome, don't let this deter you. However, I would ask that you would do this for me as well.

P.P.S. I would also like to say that this can be in ANY FORM you like. For example, you could just sit down and write it and not edit it at all and just let things flow...or you could do a ""Q & A"" session with yourself...or you could do a story...it doesn't matter. ANYTHING you want to do...it's all you. You also don't have to write your entire life story...just write about you. I'd like your life story...but it's whatever you want to say about yourself. You can leave stuff out or be as accurate as possible. It's all up to you.

Also, I would like to have them sent to me through e-mail. I'll give you that address the night before my birthday. Okay? Cool."

I have this cough that tore up my throat last night, so now it hurts to talk or laugh or really breathe, even. (NO, I am NOT making this up just so I don't have to record the song) But it's alright - I'm actually kind of having fun with it. I'm carrying around a pad of paper and writing stuff down. I thought it might be nice to have someone around to explain to people why I wasn't talking, but Adam proved me very wrong. (""Oh, Jack can't talk. She's taken a vow of silence. No, or was it celibacy? Yeah, she can't talk because she's taken a vow of celibacy."")

Um...anthro was awesome today. Not because of the class itself, but because of Ben Nodzak, whom I salute. *salutes with wet umbrella* We watched this video today on marriage customs in China. The narrator was this British guy with a rather deep voice - you know, the very typical average British narrator type. Randomly, Ben would interject with his own British narrator commentary, and it was glorious.
Nar: ""...this symbol, which stands for double happiness.""
Ben: ""And butter.""

Nar: ""...after the Communist Party.""
Ben: ""The Communist party was a lovely party, with chex mix and fruit punch. And butter. And everyone got a terrier.""

Shocking, I know...but what happened was that we broke the class in half so we could all read our 60 second radio ads to each other. Then everyone else and the teacher would critique (AKA beat the crap out of) it. The teacher was calling off random names from the attendance list, and I desperately didn't want to go next, so I was silently screaming ""GOD, DON'T LET HIM CALL ON ME, PLEASE NOT ME, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE..."" So of course, my name was next. I was very nervous, but I read it anyway. Afterwards, the teacher just kind of stood there and said ""Okay, anybody got anything?"" The kid behind me said ""That was REALLY good."" The teacher cut him off and said ""Yeah, that WAS really good."" That was the first time he'd said that about anyone's...and the kid behind me just kept talking about it...I was so embarassed... The teacher kept bringing it up later, too..."

"event","Yesterday was pretty freaking great until about 11 PM. Ummmm...I had a dentist appointement at 2:30, and I didn't get there until 3 due to the RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF SNOW THAT WE HAVE!!! I left early too...anyway. After the dentist I drove over to Tuttle mall (using the secret shortcut through Dublin because 25 MPH on 270 just sucks) and bought Nate's Christmas present...although I think he might already have it...anywaaay. Then I went upstairs, where NIKKI AND OBADIAH from RadioU (http://tvulive.com/radiou/riot.htm) were doing gift wrapping for FREE. WOOOT. DJ Cole was also there, and he took pictures, which means I may be on the Newsletter. HUTTAH. Um...talked to Obi a little...'cause he's awesome...and then I signed up to win that XBox...'cause YES YES YES YES. Actually, I signed Nate up too...and I really really hope he wins because that would be the best present EVER. And if I win I'm considering giving it to him anyway...even though I'm not going to win...so whatever.

After fun mall times, I left and tried to fly on 270 back to Hanna's house so we could go out to dinner before seeing the Nutcracker. WHEEE!! Due to the slowness of everything, I didn't have time to meet them at her house, so we all met at Sunflower and had a delicious delicious Chinese meal. YAY WOR SUE GAI!!! *drools* Um...then we drove very very carefully downtown and made it in plenty of time. Then we enjoyed the Nutcracker. Dan was in it, but we couldn't tell who he was because he was a mouse and they had hats on. Apparently, he was the mouse who fell down. We didn't clap for the Russian dancers because BalletMet told Dan he was going to be a Russian dancer and then got other people to do it. And the entire time I was thinking about how much better it would be if Emma were playing the Nutcracker's part. 

...drove back to Hanna's, and planned on having much much funtimes, but then mom called and demanded I drive home right then and there. Her excuse was that it was a level 3 snow emergency, but there are many reasons why she's stupid:

1) I live less than a 3 minute drive away from Hanna.
2) She insisted that I drive to my dentist's appointement and she had no problem whatsoever with me driving everyone downtown and back even though the roads were REALLY bad, worse than they were when she demanded that I come home, because...
3) Our road had been recently paved and were very easy to drive on. (When I left for the dentist, it had not been paved)

So, I had to open my present very quickly (it was a cow ornament and the awesome cow figuriene that I wanted (http://atlanta.cowparade.net/cow/large/1593) and say goodbye. Then I went home (this was around 11 PM) and got my car stuck in my driveway. I tried for about 20 minutes to get it out, and due to being in about a foot of snow, I couldn't, but I successfully got my shoes soaked and my feet completely numb, as well as my hands. So I went back in the house, and pulled out my cellphone from the bag I had been carrying everything in, and found that it had Lo Mein juice all over it. While I was washing that off, Hanna called and left me a message telling me that she might have left her grandmother's rosary in the car and asked me to go look for it and call her ASAP. So I put on all my wet and cold clothes again and go back out and get more wet and re-freeze. I didn't find lthe rosary, which makes me sad for Hanna, and I call her to let her know, and her dad answers and yells at me for calling so late. I get a sentence in edgewise about Hanna and the rosary, and he stomps off to get her, and comes back to tell me she's asleep and hangs up before I can apologize. Then I have to call Nate back and I don't want to because all I want to do is go to bed and forget about it all, so I'm kind of brusque and short with him, and then he gets upset. 

So blah.

"event","Today, I got up at 6:45 in the AM. It was ridiculous. However, it was for a darn good reason. Laura picked me up at 7:15, and we went back to that foul, disgusting hovel known as OLENTANGY HIGH SCHOOL. It was actually really great at first; everything was so familiar...The first person we see/recognize is Mrs. Canfield, the very teacher we were there to see. Every year, Mrs. Canfield (senior English teacher) has her previous year seniors come back and answer college questions for her current seniors. The fist thing she says to me is ""Madison! Where's the cow?"" (...I'll explain later. It has to do with http://www.angelfire.com/moon/ourang_outang/Cow/
chronicles.html). It was hi-larious. Then we answered the same questions over and over again for about 4 periods; it was really great to hear other kids' college horror stories. Only about 15 people were there at a time, but I saw a few of really good friends that I miss. Um...we went over to see Mr. Myers, ONLY TO DISCOVER that he wasn't there. MASS STRUGS. I called him and he was all like ""Oh, woe is me, I had a wrestling tournament today..."" and I was all like ""Um, 'SCUSE ME?? Since when is wrestling more important than ME?"" and he's all like ""Never...but I didn't know you were coming...call me Monday. We'll hang out."" and I was like ""Dat's cool, bro. Catch ya on the flip side. Peace out."" Yup. That's definitely EXACTLY how the conversation went. Ask Laura. She was there. She'll vouch for me. Yo.

Um...visited lots of teachers...saw lots of people...it still surprises me to no end the huge amount of people that love me. My entire upper body is bruised due to the amount of hug attacks that I recieved today. Seriously, I walked in the band room door, and that was as far as I got for 10 minutes. People just kept coming and coming and hugging and hugging. It was great. It's nice to have a legacy. 

After that, Laura and I went to Panera. Let me tell you, not only does Panera have delicous food, but Laura is goooood company. Seriously, I have such a good time hanging out with her. Makes me wish I could do it far more often. *sheds a tear* We had great great fun. Um...then I went home and played URU. YESSSSS. I'm finally getting somewhere in it. I was stuck for so long...and now...*sigh of happy* Just as I had linked to this new and amazing place, I hear ""Helloooo..."" coming from somewhere in the house. As it turns out, a burglar had gotten in and wanted to know where I kept the leftovers. So I showed Charlotte to the fridge and fed her. We talked and 'twas much fun. I miss her muchly as well. She couldn't stay for long; she just popped in for a bite to eat and a chat. Oh, and to take back her art barbies. And the troll.

Um...played Uru for some more...yaaaay...quit at 4, but ""Two Guys and a Girl"" wasn't on today. So I continued playing Uru until 6, when I rushed all 20 VHS tapes back to Mr. Lutz at school, and was loved on by people some more. Then I rushed over to Amul India and had dinner with mom, Dad, Aunt Patty, and a friend of hers...I forget her name. It was deeeeelicious. I love that restaurant. Dad left halfway through to go take more pictures of the Balletmet Nutcracker...wonder how Dan's doing...anyway. 

After dinner, I went over to Erin's house. On the way, I talked to Nate. I miss him so much. He was supposed to be home tonight, but he was too tired to drive. This would be considered silly, seeing as it wasn't late at all, but the fact is that he hasn't slept for more than 3 hours in the past three days - and that's just adding up the catnaps he's had. I am so, SO proud of that kid. THREE DAYS?? That is so awesome I can't believe it. Of course, I'm certainly not CONDONING such behavior, or saying that it's healthy...but THREE DAYS?? That blows MY record out of the water and into...like...space. I still have yet to stay up for 48 hours. Ah well, I've still got two more quarters to achieve this...
Nate and I also talked about a lecture his teacher gave him today...Nate had procrastinated on his final project, and his teacher was really really disappointed. He said ""You have more talent than all of the other people in this class...and they kicked your butt on this project."" Basically, he told Nate that if he tried, really tried, he would be amazing, probably one of the best kids in the school, and he would get noticed by some of the top movie companies in the country. I told him, I know. I've been telling you this for years. You're amazing. But I'm glad that someone in the actual profession is finally telling you this. He's...he's so good. He really is. He's an amazing artist, and...I know he's going to be so great. So great...with the way he loves God more than anything, and the mind-numbing talent that he has been blessed with...

Um...anyway. Showed up at Erin's house, and crazy loved on again...Erin ran up and gave me my Christmas present. It was a CD case SHAPED LIKE A COW HEAD. And, inside in the middle, WAS IT'S TONGUE. And, on the tongue, WAS A BAR OF GODIVA CHOCOLATE. *faints* Best present EVER. God, I love my friends.

I talked to her mom for a while (who also told me how much she loved me and how wonderful I am), and then we all watched The Chronicles of Riddick. It was pretty good; I didn't understand some of it; I need to see Pitch Black. But what I DID get was that THE GIRL'S NAME WAS JACK. I'm very upset. You know, you THINK you're being original, but you FAIL. She was really cool, too - although, in this movie, she changed her name to Kyra. I thought she was a great character. But !#%$^#^!!!!!! Jack was MINE. Oh well.

This just in:

MADISON MACKLIN HAS FOUND HER HOMESTAR RUNNER HAT

<i>December 15, 2004  Powell, OH</i>

Madison Macklin, age 18, fell in love with beanies at the age of 15. ""My friend Charlotte and I were cleaning out our Tuba lockers, and we found this very simple black beanie. We both tried it on, and after much whining on my part, Charlotte let me have it. Things have, well, never been the same since."" She wore the black beanie as much as physically possible until Spring Break her junior year. ""Well, I went to London, England with the school (and my good friend Laura), and when I got off the final plane back in Ohio, the hat was no longer with me."" She was devastated. But she knew what to do next. ""Yeah, I'd been looking on the internet at my favorite site Homestarrunner.com, and I went over to the store page, and I found this awesome beanie with Homestar's face on it. I said, that's the hat for me!"" She purchased the beanie as soon as possible. Again, Madison wore the hat all the time. ""I'd wear it at school, even - throughout the first three periods of the day. My teachers got so used to seeing me with it that they didn't even tell me to take it off anymore. It was great."" Throughout time, however, Madison lost her beloved beanie a few times. Fist she left it at a Kohl's store, but it was recovered when a store employee recognized the picture Madison had drawn at the lost and found desk. She was overjoyed to recover it. However, horror struck again in the winter of her Senior year. ""I would put the beanie in my Tuba locker for safekeeping until I finished the school day. One day, I went to retrieve it...and it was gone."" Devastated, Madison put notices on the band board and offered a reward for the beloved hat. But it was no good; the hat remained gone. Heartbroken, Madison tried to move on. However, her good friend Nate Barton decided to buy her the hat again for Christmas. ""It was the nicest thing - I found out later that a lot of my friends were planning the same thing. I don't know what I'd do without them."" After recieving the hat in the mail, Madison vowed never to lose it again. However, this was not the case. ""Winter rolled around this year, and I went to get my hat - and it wasn't where it should have been. I checked all the usual places - no dice."" She frantically searched everywhere she knew; but the hat was nowhere to be found. She began to give up hope. ""I began thinking, maybe I'm just not supposed to HAVE a beanie. I mean, that was the third one in TWO YEARS."" Madison was forced to go through her first semester of college without the familiar head object. But today, Madison was cleaning her room, and decided to go through a pile of clothes that she usually pretended she couldn't see. ""Well, it's all this stuff I don't really know what to do with - some of it is other people's, and some of it is just pieces of fabric that I don't know where to put. You know, stuff like that. But I pulled out this big blue towel, and BAM! The hat rolled out onto the bed. It was amazing."" What does she think about this for the future? ""I know I'll never lose THIS thing again!"" she laughs as she pats the hat lovingly. ""And you know what the ironic thing is? I rediscovered a sweatshirt that I forgot all about."" She holds up a sweatshirt with the United Kingdom's flag on it that states in big letters: LONDON.

War or conflict bothers you, and you would do anything to keep the peace.
You are a good mediator and a true negotiator.
Sometimes you do too much, trying so hard to make people happy.

You lose respect for people who don't like to both give and take.

"event","Job search status: I called Chick-Fil-A today...the manager (of Chick-Fil-A) was confused. ""Did someone say they were going to call you back?"" He asked this about three times during the 2 minute conversation...that's like, once every 40 seconds. Anyway, I told him that I was very interested in working for Chick-Fil-A and was just wondering about the status of my application. He said he was looking at it right now, and he'd put it in front and tell the store owner that I called.

That's good...right?

Anyway...I hung out with Janice yesterday. It was really really funtimes!! I got to her house around 5:30, and found her and her boyfriend's mom moving this large pile of wood from in the middle of the driveway to either inside the garage or up against the wall of the house. I dove right in with them, and after about 30-45 minutes, we had it all moved. It was fun. Then Janice and I went to Logan's steakhouse...IT WAS SO GOOD. We both had the same thing - teriyaki steak with a slice of pineapple on top. W007!!1 It was deeeeeeeeeeeelicious. Not to mention that the rolls were amazing...They were about the size of my fist, and yummyyummyyummy. Janice also made me eat salad, which I thank her for...I need vegetables. And apparently, potatos don't count. If they did, I would have been set, because these amazing mashed potatos and gravy came with the steak...ohhhh buddy. After the meal, which was just fun, we went back to the house and taked for many many hours. And ate mini Reese's cups. I left around 11:30, I think, and went the wrong way on 270 (I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE. I WENT EAST, AND ENDED UP GOING NORTH, SO I TOOK SOUTH TO GO HOME. But noooooooooo...that was the WRONG way. RIDICULOUS.). I got home and the power was out. YAY CANDLES!!

"event","I just had a dream in which Kyle Copeland, Patty Malecha and I had to do a project together for a class - a project which consisted of me playing ""Amazing Grace"" on the tuba, Patty accompanying me on accordian, a poster of Garfield, and someone else playing maracas while a stereo played some random music under a large plastic storage box. It WASN'T a music class, either. And Draco Malfoy was in the class. And Snape kept coming in to watch. And the teacher was Mrs. Malley, who was my 8th grade English teacher. And Malfoy made out with the best girl in school while everyone watched.

"event","...make that FOUR thanksgivings...I had one today with the Jones family, my mom's side. Deeeelicious. Everything was sooooooooo yummy - Char's mashers and gravy, Hanna's mashers and gravy and applesauce and stuffing, Jones's masers and gravy and corn casserole...basically, I love mashed potatos and gravy. I love it like no other. Oh, and the turkey was pretty good too. Char's and Hanna's were the best. I must say that I never had a craving for stuffing until I had the kind with apples in it that Char and Hanna had...

Now I'm hungry again. Crap. 

Tomorrow I'm going to COSI...and there's no one to go with me. *sad*

Ooo! I saw Lyman today! YAAAAAAAY!!! He brought Lindsey (Linsey? Lindsay? LINSEED??) with him. I like her, but I always feel like I can't include her in anything...she won't look at me or take part in conversation. I just feel like I make her very very uncomfortable, which makes me sad, because I think she's cool. I wish I knew how to make her feel accepted and happy...anyway, YAY FOR LYMAN!!! I also got to talk to Janice today. How exciting! Hopefully, I shall get to see her soon. I'm so glad I have her number now. She said she called me because she had a dream about me - I had my tuba and I was saying ""Call me. Call me. Call me. CALL ME."" Sounds pretty accurate.

I also saw ""National Treasure"" with Nate and Sarah tonight. I really enjoyed it. Immensely. Like, really a lot. It was exciting, and there was a love story BUT it did NOT take center stage, which I LOVED - the treasure hunt remained the most important part. The soundtrack was very good, and so was the acting, and so were the sets. OH, they did such a good job on the sets. Very realistic. The CG was very well done, too...I didn't notice it at all, actually, although I'm fairly certain I know where it was. The plot was, in my opinion, quite good, and the characters were well written. (You know you've been in college too long (specifically THAR 170) when you start writing critiques about movies when you don't have to...) I especially loved the $100 bill thing...if you see it and you know me well enough, you'll get it. *sigh* Happy. I'm looking forward to seeing it again.

"event","So today was pretty funtimes...I had THREE thanksgivings, when all was said and done. The first one (and prolly best tasting one) was at Charlotte's house. Good Gundam, her mom can cook. *drool* It was wonderful, and I got to see Charlotte for the first time in a hundred years (read: month or so). And Nate was there, AND NICK!! YAAAY NICK. I need to talk to him more...I just never know what to say. I hate that. I should try harder. Heck, I should just TRY. *sigh*

Um...then I went to my cousin's house for the Macklin thanksgiving...it wasn't as tasty, but still quite good. My cousin is extremely pregnant - she actually started having labor pains at 6 AM this morning, but they stopped. They have a dog that I petted. 

THEN I went to the Katz's house, around 9:45 PM. I sat in the basement with Hanna for about an hour watching Shrek 2. That movie is so awesome. Tim and Steve arrived about halfway through, and at 11 we went upstairs and attacked the leftovers. OMG OMG OMG OMG MRS. KATZ IS AMAZING. She is such an awesome cook. I think her gravy was better than Kim's (Char's mom)...IT WAS LIKE SWIMMING IN SALT. YUUUUMMMM. And it was hilarious, due to Tim and Steve being awesome. ""WOMAN! MAKE ME SOME GRAVY!!"" LOL. Hiding from Mr. Katz...also LOL. Ohhhhh man...that was so fun. As we were stuffing ourselves silly (after already being stuffed), we decided that Thanksgiving is the epitome of what is wrong with the human race. ""Buy the BIGGEST FREAKING TURKEY you can find, eat about a fourth of it, and throw the rest away."" ""Eat until you throw up or pass out. And then eat more.""

So that was MY thanksgiving. I've got another one tomorrow...the question is, should I go job hunting first?? *sigh* Probably. BOOOOOO. I need a job so bad...*cries*"

"event","Okay. Tonight was pretty fantastic. First, I called Hanna on my cell phone as I walked to her house, but I didn't TELL her I was walking to her house. When I was on her street, she said ""Hey, where are you?"" 

<P>I said ""Uhhh...walking around."" 

<P>""Walking around where?""

<P>""Oh, on the street.""

<P>""Oh, so you're at college.""

<P>""Uhh...yeah."" So then she started talking about something else, and I walked in her front door, and she says, ""Uh-oh...someone just walked in the door."" I look around the corner and say, ""Yeah, I WONDER WHO??"" She pretty much screamed and fell over. It was awesome. 

<P>So then we watched ""Dead like me"" for another 45 minutes...and then we started watching the first episode, which she had on tape. During this, Dan walks in the door, and stands at the opening to the living room. He can't see me, and I say ""Hi, Dan,"" and he says ""Hi mom-WHAAAA??"" It was turribly funny. So then he sat and we all watched (but didn't finish) the first episode. The reason we didn't finish was because Nate and I started playing ""phone tag"" (""You're breaking up."" ""WITH YOU!"") At one point I called Pizza Hut and then, when Nate didn't pick up, I quickly said, ""Oh, I'm sorry, I have the wrong number."" Apparently, it's not illegal to ask to talk to Nate at work. Go figure.

<P>Anyway, when I finished talking with Nate, ""Whose Line"" was on TV (ABC family channel), so Hanna, Dan, and I all watched it. It was the epi with Whoopi Goldberg on it, and it was hilarious. BUT...we were all chatting during a commercial break, and I was looking at the TV, as was Dan, and all of a sudden, right in between the commercials, for only a split second, I saw the words ""It is better than puppies."" NO JOKE. It was there just long enough for me to read it. My mouth dropped open, and I was silent for a second, and then said ""DID YOU GUYS <u>SEE</u> THAT??"" Dan goes ""YES, I DID!"" and Hanna's like, WTF mates? And I say ""It is better than <u>PUPPIES</u>?????"" It was ridiculous! We sat through two more episodes of ""Whose Line"", and about three more commercial breaks from the first time, we saw it again. It was craziness!! It was like the TV was trying to subliminally tell us something - we don't know what, but <i>something</i> - was better than puppies. Hanna didn't see it until the third time it popped on. She had vowed not to go to bed until she saw it. So she sat down about two feet away from the TV and stared at it for about two commercial breaks. While we were waiting for the next break (maybe THAT was their trick - they wanted us to look FORWARD to watching the commercials!), I said ""Maybe it's like hiccups - you have to forget about them. You have to not think about them. Maybe if we stop thinking about it, it will come on."" Dan, jumping on this, said ""Forget about hiccups? HUH?"" And we proceeded to begin talking about hiccups, and then a meat commercial came on, and we started talking about meat. And right at the moment where I completely forgot about the split-second commercial and began thinking about eating some meat...POOF. There it was. We all saw it, and we all started going ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"" It was insane. 

<P>(I looked it up on the internet - <A href=""http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA448547?display=Marketing%2FAdvertising"">http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA448547?display=Marketing%2FAdvertising</A> & <A href=""http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20040824005719&newsLang=en"">http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20040824005719&newsLang=en</A> )

<P>Then, after that, Hanna went to bed, and Dan and I waited through an episode and a half of ""Wonder Years"" for it again so I could record it on a tape...but no such luck. We mostly just talked through the show, and the commercials. At about 12:58 AM, after we had given up on the ad, I went to Cartoon Network to see when Foster's was on next (""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"", <A href=""http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/fosters/index.html"">http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/fosters/index.html</A> & <A href=""http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/fosters/clips/clip01.html"">http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/fosters/clips/clip01.html</A>), and I saw that the next show that was on was Cowboy Bebop. So, of COURSE, we watched it. It was the first epi, and it was wonderful...I had rather forgotten how great that show is. I HAVE TO SEE THE LAST TWO EPISODES...omigosh, I love that show. *drool*

I was up until about 5 AM last night (this morning...) getting every single file I've ever thought about needing at some point off my home compies and onto a CD so I could load it here. I've also got 5 computer games I'm going to load and play, as well as about 4 or 5 programs I'm going to load onto the compy here (one of which is Kazaa lite). 

I have yet to put up my Christmas lights. Doctor Octopus is currently riding a llama. There is a cow (Mr. Bizkit, of course) and a moose on my bed. When my parents were getting ready to leave, my dad started to cry (while trying to hide it and failing). That made me want to attach myself to his shoe and not let go and go back to Columbus. It's the only part of this endeavor that has made me very sad. VERY sad. I miss all my friends already.

Now I'm going to load the entire contents of my MP3 player onto the computer. TA!

P.S. Pentium 4 processor, 2.4 GHz, 256 MB RAM, 38 gig hard drive. Oh yes. 

P.P.S. My mom has called a total of four times since she left, around 6:30. No, wait, make that 5. There was a message on the answering machine *(740) 597-7258*

P.P.P.S. Who does that really awesome rock version of ""Wouldn't it be loverly"" on the Hampton inn commercial? I've searched the entire internet, and I cannot find the answer to that which I seek.

"event","Okay...I WILL WRITE ABOUT THIS NOW. Even though I'm not really in the mood. (Sorry about the length...this is mostly for ME to remember this trip, so if you REALLY don't want to read it, that's fine - it's rather entertaining, though.)

I went to Chicago with the Katz family (what other family would drag me with them to anywhere public?). On Friday, I went to the Katz's, and with all John's stuff piled so high in the back of the minivan it threatened to gobble up Hanna and I, the Mother, and John, we pulled out (to the joyous sight of Mr. Katz doing the Yatta dance...*entire world collectively shudders...*). Dan was, of COURSE, still asleep. I don't think that boy has even SEEN 10:30 AM.

Anyway, the first few hours down were quite eventful. There was the play-by-play of the speeding cars: us, and the Heep (which later became the Jonda). After we stopped to get pottied, we get some milk and some cinnabon things, which I don't think we ever ate. At the next rest stop, I find that the milk has leaked onto my sandal, so I walk into the mall-like rest stop barefeeted, carrying my sandals, and wash them in the bathroom. Then I hop around the place with one shoe. I think everyone thought I was a bum, or disabled and crazy. Meh. 

By the time 3 PM rolled around, we were all <b>kinda</b> tired of being in the car. Dan and Father Katz, however, were just on their way to Chicago, and would arrive there in an hour - by PLANE. *mutters inane and pointless curses* :shakefist: Anyway, after some hefty rush-hour-in-downtown-Chicago traffic, and some even heftier cussing and raging by John (who was driving), we arrive at our hotel, The Allerton. I think I saw Dan first. It made me smile, because A) it's generally nice to see Dan because he's great, and B) he was wearing this really awesome jacket and carrying around a root beer bottle, and from the back he looked like a really high-class bum - like the British ones that go ""Shine yo' shoes, guvnah?"" Plus he was dancing around in a jig-like manner. So huzzah. We unload our bags (no help from the jigging bum, of course) and drag them up to the room. Hanna and I had our own suite, which was SWEET. The rest of them shared. HA. 

Um...after we got in the rooms, Dan, Hanna, the Mom and I went to H&M for to do some shopping of the clothing variety. I normally hate this, but I didn't hate it at H&M. They have decent clothing, AND it fits, AND the way Hanna shops is great: buy it all, try it on at home, take back what doesn't fit. No in-store trying on stuff! I wish that I could have bought all guys' clothes, but my mom would have murdered me. Or at least not paid for any of it. So I only got ONE guy's thing. Poor Dan didn't find anything - except the most AWESOME hat. It was one of those ones...you know...I forget what they're called. They're the ones that the boys wear in ""Newsies"". The Brooklyn guy wears one. Yeah. That one. It was so awesome I almost sneezed. It made perfect the British Bum look - which is actually a very good look for Dan. 

THEN we went back and went to P.F. Chang's. Woo hoo. They have good tea. And a really great ""Great wall of Chocolate"". The double great is intended. Um...we ate that back at the hotel and watched...um...I <b>think</b> that was the Indiana Jones/comic book/video game night. Dan, John, Father-figure and I all sat there and talked for about an hour or so about the above topics, and it was REALLY cool. Dan = Sonic God. John = pervert. ""I just knew I'd get you on my bed eventually."" :stab:

The next day was...eventful. Hanna and I got up at 9 (I had one of the best sleeps EVER and woke up 5 minutes before the alarm), tired on all our clothes, went to breakfast with the Mother, and OFF TO THE SIGHTS! We three went to the history museum and saw the ""Forbidden City"" exhibit...it was really awesome. All this stuff from China's emperor days...including this 3' x 2' tall carved thing of JADE. It was all very expensive and cool. Then we went to the gift shop, and I foolishly talked myself into buying $10-each stone coasters, with the Chinese symbols for ""Love"" and ""Peace"" on them...if you don't get why, you shall be slapped. Hanna got a neat-o chinese scarfy thing that she wore the other day. Quite superb. Then Hanna and I went off to the aquarium, where we sat for about 45 minutes waiting for a dolphin show. It was fun. We also saw some froggies, some weeeeird fish, otters, beluga whales, seals, AND AN ANACONDA THAT I WANT TO STEAL. Omigosh, I love it so much. *drool* Nevermind that it would kill me. I WANT IT (along with Doc Ock, and the Predator). After that we taxied to Millenium Park and took pictures - Hanna is so awesome at taking pictures of fountainy-types and scenery-types! You should go look at her stuffs (http://ruby-dragon88200.deviantart.com/gallery/).

THEN we walked back to the hotel (and saw those street performers who pretend they're statues, protesting for gay marriage...they were both women, one in a white wedding gown and face painted white, and one in a black tuxedo-skirt, face painted black) and went to dinner at the Grand Lux cafe. It was FABULOUS. Fabulous, I tell you! The appetizers alone were better than...um...pickles. And the STEAK! Oh my goodness, let me tell you about the steak: IT WAS GOOD. Hanna got chicken parmesan with a piece of chicken so big that she could have used it as a hat, and John got a ridiculously huge amount of ""fried chicken"", which was really just fantasticly good chicken fingers. The dinner topics included the following: John and Dan making terribly lame food puns (I believe ""ketchup"" was used three times in the same way...and ""fork you"" was a favorite); Dan and I making jokes based on internet conversations; and everyone's personal favorite, John making Madi REALLY uncomfortable and weirded out (with Dan helping out - albeit accidentally :threaten:) The Mother even managed to make Dan and Madi very uncomfortable and weirded out. Too bad we couldn't have just *annihilate -ed ourselves...

It was all very fun (although had he been close enough, I would have punched John a whole lot) - and desert was delightful: the Chocolate Bomb, which was a brownie-like substance with a melted chocolate innard. MMMMMMM. 

After that, we all went on a jolly walk (although Dan was doing some odd jiggity-jump walk, to our great amusement) to Millenium park, where Hanna and I had taken fun pictures at earlier (which you will see later). There are two main awesomeities that I would like to touch upon: the metal sculpture (http://www.millenniumpark.org/sbcplaza.htm), and the Crown Fountain (http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail.php?ID=640) (Be sure to read the descriptions). We stopped at both, but the most fun was had at the fountain. As can be seen in the picture, there are the two big fountains, and on the sides facing eachother, there are faces. But on the rest of the sides, there are just lots of brick-looking things, and the whole fountain changes colors. We went up to them, took a good look, and decided that pictures must occur. Dan was wearing his jacket and his new hat, and we took silhouetes of him in front of the bright fountain. We then went over to the Jay Pritzker pavillion, which is an outdoor concert venue that's really cool - just a stage, with some seating up front, and then a big huge grassy knoll for which to sit upon. While we were there, some fireworks started occurring for no reason. I had gotten separated from the Katz-types, and ended up next to some strangers. I didn't even notice them there until one came up to me and said ""Hey, do you see those fireworks over there?""
Thinking what a stupid question that was, I pleasantly replied ""Yes.""
""Why are they there?""
""Um...I have no clue."" I had concluded from this conversation that this guy was weird. This was confirmed when he went back to his group o' strangers and one said ""Maybe it's 'cause we won the war."" Then another said ""We won? Let's have pancakes!""

After locating the Katz's on a bridge, we went back to the fountains and had fun. Daniel began to do his jumpy-jiggy-thingy in the fountain itself, and I tried to take pictures. Apparently, people were cheering him on (as well they SHOULD - Dan is SO COOL!!!). Then his mom went to join him and they did some swing-dancing and some tango-ing, all in front of this big, tall, lit-up fountain. It was so hilarious! Then Hanna went up and danced with Dan much in the same manner - it was so-o-o-o neat. I took forever taking one last photo of them posed in front of the fountain (which WILL be up here later). It was such a wonderful evening that it's hard to describe it. Part of it was our surroundings, which were lovely, and part of it was the general kindness of the general public, and another part was the gorgeous weather that night, and part of it was the company we had with eachother. It was so...I dunno. Like Hanna said, it was very dreamlike. I was sorry, very sorry, to see it end. We went back to the hotel and watched some TV (Naked Gun 2 1/2), and then went off to bed.

Talking about Saturday night was basically the reason I wrote this...sooo...On Sunday we ate breakfast, the father flew home, and D-M-H and I went back to H&M and returned stuff, and Dan bought an awesome jacket (biker meets Fonzi?). (Dan, the Mom and I were in the girls' pants section, and I looked up to find Dan solid as stone, his gaze directly and unwaveringly staring at the girls' undergarment section. He didn't move or blink for about 30 seconds, and then I couldn't hold it any longer and started to snicker. He blinked, shook his head, and then looked at me like he just realized where he was, smiled and said ""Oh, sorry...guy moment."" That entire incident made me laugh very hard and very long. At least he admits things like that - I respect him more for it. Like this one time when...um, wait - I don't think I'm gonna tell that story. But when he has ""guy moments"", he doesn't deny everything or look stupid for trying to pretend like it didn't happen - he sucks it up and admits it. Good for him. 30 points.) Then we drove home, and had hamburgers. 

BEST TRIP EVER. I really REALLY want to go again, but I have a feeling I'm rather expensive: another mouth to feed, and body to buy a hotel room for. But I hope they know I had a GREAT time. I've told them enough times. They should know.

"event","Oooooooookaaaaaaaayyy...So. The moment we've (AKA I've) all been waiting for...MADISON'S MAGICAL ROMP THROUGH CAMP CHERITH!!!!

That's right, tomorrow (Sunday, August 1) at approx. 9 AM, I will be leaving for Camp Cherith, a camp in Michigan (http://cherith.netfirms.com/). I will be there until Saturday, August 7th. And while I am there, I will have NO internet access, and no cell phone access (no phone access period, really). BUT! This does NOT mean you can't (or shouldn't) contact me whatsoever. I will be expecting LETTERS from people. If I don't get letters from you, I will be VERY MAD. And I'm not kidding. SEND ME LETTERS. Here's the address:

Madison Macklin
Huron Forest Camp Cherith
1154 W. River Road
Oscoda, MI 48750

(Also acceptable to send to this address: pictures, video tapes (although I can't watch them until Friday night), cassette tapes, cookies, and lots and lots of CHOCOLATE!)

Now: it takes 3-4 days for mail to arrive at camp. So don't be sendin' me letters on Friday. SEND ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I really want to hear from you all. Kristin (banditwriter.deviantart.com) sent me a letter last year, and it was really great. I still have it. She's just great anyway. Anyway...

For all of you who absolutely KNOW you will not be sending me a letter (because you're lazy, terrible people), I have another option for you: BUNK1.COM! This is an service in which you sign in, write an e-mail, and send it to the camp, and then it gets printed out and given to me. I can't so much reply to this...but it's cool. It gets sent the day AFTER you write it, so the last day you can write me anything is Friday. Here's the link: http://www.bunk1.com/template/login.asp?origin=/template/community.asp&form_camp_id=7527&logout=1  Sign in as ""WriteOrDie"", with password ""Hinithil"". Then you can click on ""Bunk Notes"", and write to me. 

I'm debating whether or not I should buy 12 notes or 5 notes...I don't know how much you guys are going to respond to this...I guess I'll go with 12. 

PLEASE WRITE ME LOTS. 

Okay...guess that's it...byeeeee..............."

I went to see HP3 again today with the kid and Hanna and Nate. It was fun. Especially when Regi and I were the only ones left in the room after the credits and he began climbing the wall...and then one of the clerks walked in. Nate dropped down from the wall and just kind of stood there, while I tried my best to look harmless, friendly, and innocent, and the guy just stared at us, really confused-like. No one said anything for about 10 seconds. Then he put up both his hands in a ""none of my business"" gesture, and left. 

...Why do things like that always seem to happen around Nate??

I am now addicted to chicken wrapped in a pita-like bread. I've had them before, but I've had three different ones in the past week (one at Steak Escape, one at Aladdin's - YOU MUST GO - and one at CV Wrappers), and I MUST HAVE MORE...I think mebbe I just like pitas, because I am also teh wanting of a gyro from Acropolis Gyro Palace near The Melting Pot (GAHHHHBESTRESTAURANTEVER), which is the best gyro I've ever had...not that I'm a gyro connoisseur or anything. Alas, Chick-Fil-A has only grilled chicken wraps...If they were to make a wrap with fried chicken and that new honey BBQ sauce of theirs, it would be the BEST wrap EVER. EVER! I think I'll drive to the owner of Chick-Fil-A's house right now and demand it. Maybe I'll pick up some breaded fish on my way home. And some carpet squares.

So we had a band competition tonight. It was thirty light-years away in Bellefountain, where water springs eternally out of bells. And then it freezes on hills and people pay lots of money to go down them standing on pieces of wood. 

Anyway, after getting lost and turning around a few times, we arrived at Ben Logan high school (or whatever high school it was, I can't really remember, I think I made ""Ben Logan"" up...) and I proceeded to drag my hugemongus tuba into the school. But my arms are still sore from Wednesday and I pretty much fail at going at any speed higher than 5, and so my flute friend helps me out. So we're both now toddling along at a speed of 6, and this kid behind us goes ""Uh...I can carry that for you, if you like."" Normally, I would be horribly opposed to this, because I am stupid and don't like men to carry things for me. But I wanted to see him stumble with the weight of the mighty tuba (for he is but a lowly alto saxamaphone), and so I let him. But...he didn't crumble in a heap of pain. I was very disappointed. 

Then we did the band thing, and I missed a high D on my solo, but it mattered not. We got two I's and a II on the stage, and a I in sight reading, which gives us a I over all, which means we're special and get a gold star. And we get to go to State. I'm kind of disappointed. I mean, what happened to our beloved Olentangy tradition of coming ridiculously close to going to State but just not making it quite far enough? I don't know. But that tradition has crashed and burned. And now we have to try even harder to be better at whatever it is we're doing. I forgot. What was I talking about?"

Guns do not make you a killer.  I think killing makes you a killer.  You can kill someone with a baseball bat or a car, but no one is trying to ban you from driving to the ball game.

I believe they are called the Boy Scouts for a reason, that is why there are no girls allowed. Girls belong in the Girl Scouts! ARE YOU LISTENING MARTHA BURKE?

I think that if you feel homosexuality is wrong, it is not a phobia, it is an opinion.

I don't think being a minority makes you a victim of anything except numbers.  The only things I can think of that are truly discriminatory are things like the United Negro College Fund, Jet Magazine, Black Entertainment Television, and Miss Black America. Try to have things like the United Caucasian College Fund, Cloud Magazine, White Entertainment Television, or Miss White America; and see what happens. Jesse Jackson will be knocking down your door.

I have the right ""NOT"" to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird, or tick me off.  When 70% of the people who get arrested are black, in cities where 70% of the population is black, that is not racial profiling, it is the Law of Probability.

I believe that if you are selling me a milk shake, a pack of cigarettes, a newspaper or a hotel room, you must do it in English!  As a matter of fact, if you want to be an American citizen, you should have to speak English!

My father and grandfather didn't die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come over and disrespect ours.

I think the police should have every right to shoot your sorry self if you threaten them after they tell you to stop.  If you can't understand the word ""freeze"" or ""stop"" in English, see the above lines.

I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you are qualified for any special loan programs, government sponsored bank loans or tax breaks, etc., so you can open a hotel, coffee shop, trinket store, or any other business.

We did not go to the aid of certain foreign countries and risk our lives in wars to defend their freedoms, so that decades later they could come over here and tell us our constitution is a living document; and open to their interpretations.

I believe a self-righteous liberal or conservative with a cause is more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.

I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more.  If it ticks you off, go and invent the next operating system that's better, and put your name on the building.  Ask your buddy who 
invented the Internet to help you.

""I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't pretend they are a political statement.  And, please, stay home until that new lip ring heals. I don't want to look at your ugly infected mouth as you serve me french fries!

I am sick of ""Political Correctness.""  I know a lot of black people, and not a single one of them was born in Africa; so how can they be ""African-Americans""?  Besides, Africa is a continent.  I don't go around saying I am a European-American because my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather was from Europe.

I am proud to be from America and nowhere else.  And if you don't like my point of view, tough.""

"event","I learned a long time ago to keep certain things a secret. I remember I was taking a friend of mine from school to the church I then attended. It was the second person I had brought (not that I was keeping track; it just comes into play later). I remember I was so ever so pleased; everyone at church liked me, which means I was about 99% more popular there than I was at school (1% margin of error). So my friend was seeing a completely different view of me. Not that I had changed, but that it was possible that people liked me. So I guess I felt charged, powerful - proud, even. I was introducing this friend of mine to all the churchie people, and I thought of a way for them to identify her (my friend) other than ""Hey, this is my friend."" So I said, ""Yeah, this is my friend, AND she's in love with that other guy I brought a few weeks ago."" This was a true statement at the time. All the churchie people said ""Ohhh! Hi!"" But my school friend just looked at me with shock and something like disgust. I was kinda confused, but later (probably right after she dragged me out of the room) she explained it (in a calm and rational manner, I'm SURE...): you just don't go and blurt things out like that. You just DON'T. Calmly and rationally, she told me that it was very RUDE to say something like that, because that's not so much something you go blurting to people. It's too personal. I'm sure that I humbly accepted this and apologized with all my might...and if I didn't, I do now. To that person: sorry. Maybe someday you'll come across this. Maybe not. Who knows. 

But that taught me the valuable lesson of keeping quiet. No matter how juicy some piece of information is, no matter how much it's weighing on your tongue, waiting for you to spill it, to let someone else in on what you know. For the sake of other peoples' feelings, their well-being, hold your tongue. And if that doesn't work, bite your tongue. And if that doesn't work, cut out your tongue and teach a parrot to talk for you. ""Brawk! Wind in your sails! Wind in your sails!"" 

""...listen here's the pleasant part 
You and I, we fell apart
Why don't you make up your mind?
Shut your mouth...
Now listen here's the clever one 
Who speaks before his thoughts are done 
Why can't you make up your mind?
Watch your mouth 
Hold your tongue 
Some things are better left unsaid 
Now I hope you're pleased 
You let your pride stand tall 
It danced within your words 
Right before your fall 
Why don't you say that to my face 
<b>If I told you this was killing me 
would you stop?</b>""

"event","#37) ""A 0.115 kg hockey puck, moving at 35 m/s, strikes a 0.265 kg octopus thrown onto the ice by a hockey fan. The puck and octopus slide off together. Find their velocity.""
            - My Physics Book

Okay, so it's been...almost a week, and I still haven't written about fun times in Michigan. So let me tell you: I had fun times in Michigan. I get to Toledo, and meet the Whipper, and Slick the cat. We all drive to who knows where in Michigan, in the general vicinity of Rachel's house. We stopped at another friend's house along the way - the Great MeatDustBunnyBall herself, Sara(h?) Gleason. She has a neat room, and 'twas grand to see her again. She has kitties. Whilst we were visiting her there, Whipper called Rachel, and told her she hadn't heard from me yet, and was still in Toledo. Now, mind you, we were only about 30 minutes away from the Rachel, and Toledo is 1.5 hours away from the Rachel. So we take our leave of the Gleason, and go to the Rachel's house. Whipper calls again, as she parks in the street outside Rachel's house, and says ""Okay, got the Madison; just now leaving Toledo."" While this occurs, I run up to the door and knock. Rachel opens it and jumps quite high into the air. Joy occurs. (I forgot to mention the most important part of the trip there: as it turns out, Detroit has a Bridge To Canada! It's called the Ambas Ador. And what's even better is there's a TUNNEL TO CANADA!!! I was so excited. !) (""We have Canada. You don't have Canada."" Michigan one, Ohio zero.)

So we go into Rachel's room, and she says ""Okay...find your Christmas present!"" Now, Rachel's room is not in the cleanest of states. So I thought, How in the WORLD am I supposed to find a gift in this mess? Well, that's not quite it, because her room's not a mess. But still. So I say ""Is it in a box?"" And for some reason, that's really funny to Rachel and Whipper. So I look around some more, and say ""How am I supposed to..."" and then, right at that moment, I look directly next to my head at a dresser, and say ""...Oh."" Because behold, there stood ever so fine a pineapple as to be seen, disguised in a tricky DQ visor. It was delightful. 

So then we (Whip, Rachel, Marshall (the boy), and me, in that order) went to dinner at this place called ""Coney Island"". It's apparantly all the rage in the Detroit area. It was quite good, although the waitress was surly, and there was an abundance of pickles that had to be dealt with, which were always seeming to find themselves in Rachel's orange juice and ice cream, with Marshall's help. This made Rachel poke Marshall. Thereby proving the infamous equation, pickles=poking.

THEN! We went to Elise's house (after failing to get to the movie theater and steal her car before she got out and stole it herself), and hung around in her room, waiting for her to come home. We turned on the computer, and plugged in the phone, and then we heard her walk in her front door. So we turned off her lights, but not the computer, and ran into the closet and closed the door. We heard Elise say ""These {shoes} look like Rachel's..."" But she suspected nothing. Until she walked into her room and her closet started giggling. Then she jumped up really high (apparently), and said something to the extent of ""Ah"" or ""Omigoshers"". Or some mix of the two. ""Amishers"". I don't know.

Then we went home and slept. 

The next morning was library day, but only after it was cut-Madison's-hair-by-three-inches-and-put-it-into-pippylongstocking-braids-except-that-they-don't-have-stick-straight-out-of-your-head-powers day. We walked (Get that? WALKED!) to Rachel's library. Upon arrival, we discovered that it may have been useful to bring Rachel's wallet, containing her library card, with us. But alas, we were not so fortunate. EXCEPT!!! As we were studiously studying (...), a girl approached us, whom Rachel recieved with joy, especially when told she had a liscence (TO KILL) and a car (WITH WHICH TO KILL). The girl's name was...uh...Pembleton...Pimienta...Paminska...Parsnip...Parsley...Parlay...actually, I can't remember her name. So we drove back, walleted Rachel, and went back to the library, and did the library thing for a few hours. Then we walked to the docks (she lives next to St. Clair Shores), and I showed my pathetic aptitude for climbing fences. Never try to get me to climb a fence. It will make you cry. 

We then walked (!) to the boy's house, walked (!) to Rachel's, got a call from Mike, who had gone to the library to find us, and met him halfway. Then we went back to Rachel's, sat on her bed for some hours, and then the males left for a basketball game, which people apparently care about in Michigan. And hockey. Hockey is big too. Mike was appalled when I didn't know the basketball and hockey teams there. Because, you know, they test us on these things in OHIO. Anyway, after they left, Rachel and I tried to get the steaks in her house to come out of their hiding places so we could feast upon them, but alas; it was not to be so. All the steaks were either eaten by or turned into pork pieces. That's what happens when you leave cows and pigs together in freezers for too long. So we settled with Italian dressing with some salad on the side, salted peanuts, a beef stew, and macaroni and cheese. The first three were eaten whilst watching a movie on body art, which was fantastic and interesting, and I think everyone should see it. Then we went to make the macaroni, and rediscovered that Rachel had no milk. So we used half and half. Never EVER do this. Ever. Even after putting three pounds of spices on it, and ketchup, it still tasted...diseased. Like Kevin, in Home Alone.

So we watched the movie again, and Nate called, and then he possesed Rachel and his voice came out of her mouth. (She mouthed and he said the same thing at the same time). Umm...then I think I saw the {E}XBox. Which was neat-o. Ummm...then I think we slept some more. 

The next day, we woke up at 6:44, and then repeated at the point in time at which Mike knocked on Rachel's window. In 5 minutes, we were on our way to a Greekish restaurant, which I forget the name. Corris Bros, or something. Something Greekish. The waitress there was kind of surly too, but the food and company was good. Mike is a fun gui. Although he likes cancer a whole lot. Too much, if you ask me...

Then we pooted around at Rachel's house, and thought of the neat idea of trading cards for Ohio peoples and Michiganian peoples (so if I randomly take your picture, think nothing of it). Then Whipper took us to Toledo (after picking up her cat and getting us Baco Tell), and I went home. It was one of the best trips ever. 'Cause Rachel is possibly the coolest person EVER. With the exception of someone else who's cooler that I haven't met yet, and probably never will, because they're that cool. 

Only regrets: A) Didn't get a phone picture of Elise (but I'm using the keychain she gave me; me gusta), and B) Didn't go in to see Denise. But she was rushin' to see her Hurryian, and I texted her lots. Oh, and C) No pictures of the Tunnel to Canada signs. But these fail to ruin the trip by any means. AT ALL. It was SO FUNNESS. 

So...give it up for me.

P.S. Degus. Degoos...Deygurus?"

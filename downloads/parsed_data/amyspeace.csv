Nanci paved the way for the rest of us trying to bridge the gap between folk and roots and country music.&quot;</p><p align=""left"">Delivering a perfectly matched opening for Griffith, Speace will play songs from her new album 'The Killer In Me,' &quot;an edgy brew of roots rock, folk and pop&quot; (Arizona Republic, 8.11.09) out now on Judy Collins' Wildflower Records. On stage and on her album, Speace knows how to &quot;rock just right&quot; (Washington Post, 6.12.09), sharing stories between her narrative songs with support from the &quot;deft musicianship of her band, the Tearjerks&quot; (Arizona Republic).</p><p align=""left"">Catch Speace opening for Nanci Griffith on the following dates:</p><p align=""left"">October 22 - Ridgefield, CT - The Ridgefield Playhouse<br />October 23 - New York, NY - Town Hall<br />October 24 - North Hampton, MA - The Calvin Theatre</p><p align=""left"">Speace has earned glowing reviews for 'The Killer In Me,' an &quot;effortlessly intimate&quot; album where &quot;the seduction in Speace's voice and the smooth sound of background horns and organs make you feel exposed and susceptible&quot; (CMT.com, 7.6.09). She'll be backed by the Tearjerks at her showcase at the Americana Music Festival and Conference in Nashville on September 16.</p><p align=""left""><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.myspace.com/amyspeace"">http://www.myspace.com/amyspeace</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amyspeace.com/"">http://www.amyspeace.com/</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://amyspeace.musicdish.net"">http://amyspeace.musicdish.net</a></p>"

<p align=""left"">Like many musicians before her, <a href=""http://amyspeace.musicdish.net"" target=""_blank"">Amy Speace</a> left her family, her friends, and her home to write her new album, ""<a href=""http://www.amyspeace.com/AmySpeaceStore.html"" target=""_blank"">The Killer In Me</a>."" She left, it seems, not to escape the pain in her life, or to avoid distraction, but to absorb her feelings and transform them. This emotional osmosis drew her pain out and allowed her, as she says, ""to write the things the you're afraid to say out loud."" Amy's songs break through that fear not only in her mind but also in ours. She is not a simple song writer and ""The Killer In Me"" is not an easy listen. The cryptic meanings of her lyrics are not immediately clear and demand time to absorb their poetry. This album conjures the loneliness, sadness, and helplessness that we all sometimes feel and tempers those twisting emotions with those of hope and love. 
<p align=""left"">For this album, Amy enlists guitarist and producer James Mastro who brings a psychedelic-rock touch to the sound. His production skills mixed with Amy's song-writing ability make this album special. Songs like ""This Love"" and ""Haven't Learned a Thing,"" are beautifully woven pieces. The ghostly track, ""Weight of the World"" shows Amy's ability to sew lyrical melody to instrumental sensibility giving this song an almost programmatic feel; as if the instruments are acting out her story each time they plays the song. Other songs like ""Something More Than Rain,"" ""Piece By Piece,"" and the visionary ""Blue Horizon"" and true poetic treasures and ""Dirty Little Secret"" shakes the soul with controversy and depth.
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://www.musicdish.net/amyspeace/img_new/amyspeace4.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""266"" hspace=""2"" vspace=""2"" border=""0"">
<p align=""left"">This latest offering is a departure from Amy's previous album, ""Songs For Bright Street."" Where this album occupies an acoustic-folk sensibility, ""The Killer In Me"" rocks out and experiments with ethereal and psychedelic timbres exhibited in the songs ""Storm Warning"" and ""Better"". Overall, Amy's latest work offers a complex intimacy that was largely absent in its direct and spontaneous predecessor. 
<p align=""left""><a href=""http://myspace.com/amyspeace"" target=""_blank"">Amy Speace</a> has certainly taken a turn on the rock and roll boulevard but Amy doesn't forsake her roots. Songs like ""Would I Lie"" and ""I Met My Love"" (featuring the voice of Ian Hunter, who also appears on the title track), are infused with genuine country and folk sounds. With ""The Killer In Me"" Amy shows us all the color of her heart, a heart shrouded in blue.

The singer/songwriter celebrated the upcoming release of her new album, <a href=""http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/amyspeace4"" target=""_blank"">The Killer in Me</a>, and it is a winner, fitting right in between energetic pop-rock, and the melancholy harmonies of country. At first glance, the perky and smiley Speace doesn't seem like a singer/songwriter fighting a recent heartache, but that's just what she accomplishes with her new album.</p><p align=""left"">Playing guitar alongside a four-piece band, Speace was sharp right from the start, as rock-and-roll intertwined with her vivacious alternative country style. Speace was seemingly effortless in displaying her traditional subject matter of soul-searching. Like many singer/songwriters, Speace's compositions begin with life stories, and her set list was fittingly compiled of these stories within her songs. The album's title track, &quot;The Killer in Me,&quot; had the perfect amount of twang and tragedy to compliment her silky, achy voice, while her performance of the understated &quot;Haven't Learned A Thing,&quot; prompted everyone in the audience to rethink the constant plight we all have to better ourselves. Through the sounds of triumph and defeat, Speace dared to show vulnerability and shed light on the state of mind of someone who has loved and lost.</p><center><p style=""visibility: visible;""><lj-embed id=""13""/></p></center><br /><p align=""left"">During the rest of the set, we watched Speace easily switching back and forth between tantalizing and dark songs like &quot;Blue Horizon&quot; and the very vulnerable &quot;The Weight of the World,&quot; a disheartening and powerful acoustic tune of sorrow and unfairness. Though Speace has pulled inspiration from musicians such as Judy Collins and Lucinda Williams, she undoubtedly has enough of her own personality throughout her work as a strong, confident woman with a voice to be heard. This was unmistakably present in her performance, as Speace has composed a body of work with enough variety to keep everyone's eyes and ears on her music at all times.</p><p align=""left"">From here until the end of her nearly two-hour show, Speace left us with some of her best stuff as she and her band produced wonderfully intense, dazzling rock, a truly fitting end to a night of music shared between Speace and her New York City audience. Her music may be filled with heart-breaking honesty and aching openness, but Amy Speace is such a genuine and joyful personality that a night spent watching her perform has proved to be anything but a downer. <a href=""http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/amyspeace4"" target=""_blank"">The Killer in Me</a> was released on June 30th, 2009.</p><p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.amyspeace.com"" target=""_blank"">www.amyspeace.com</a><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/amyspeacemusic"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/amyspeacemusic</a></p><p align=""center""><img hspace=""2"" height=""270"" width=""300"" vspace=""2"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://www.musicdish.net/amyspeace/img_new/AmySpeace_TheKillerInMe72.jpg"" /></p>"

It would have been easy to understand if Amy Speace was not the most  
upbeat of performers. After all, her just released CD, &quot;The Killer In  
Me,&quot; was written and recorded in the wake of her divorce. The break-up  
didn't appear to be a pretty one with lines like &quot;The liar you hide  
has found the thief in me/Held up the truth with a loaded gun.&quot;

But for all the turmoil regarding her ended marriage, Speace, at  
least, has done what every good songwriter ought to do - she came out  
of it with songs of substance. At the same time, the New Jersey native  
did not wallow in sorry and pity for her 80 minutes on stage either.

Speace mixed a country vibe with folk roots with some songs pretty  
much splitting the difference and coming off as rootsy - not quite  
country, but not exactly folk either. Her vocals were forceful or  
tender when needed, making it all the more interesting in a lot of  
songs with water references.

Speace leavened the weight of the lyrics with her often humorous stage  
patter. &quot;Yeah, that's a love song,&quot; she joked about The Killer in Me.  
&quot;My therapist is proud of me. She said it's the first co-dependent  
love song she's heard.&quot; (On the CD, Speace sings the song with Ian  
Hunter of Mott the Hoople fame).

Before playingWeight of the World, Speace related a funny story about  
coming down during the day from a gig the previous night in Portland,  
Maine. While stopped at a gas station, she saw a man walking with a  
huge cross and decided to encounter him, finding out he was walking to  
Mexico. Acknowledging the guy was a bit off, Speace then turned in a  
good reading of the song, which her label owner Judy Collins is  
recording for her next CD.

The humor came through very loud and clear on the crowd sing-along  
Double Wide Trailer, a song from her 2006 disc, which probably would  
not go down very well in Southern, blue collar communities. It sure  
went down easy though and was funny up north.

The guitar work of her producer James Mastro (he's best known for  
being a member of The Bongos and The Health and Happiness Show) gave a  
lot of texture and bite to the music live, while also contributing  
backing vocals.

Speace may not drawn a lot of folks - about 40, although it was a  
Monday night - but she deserves credit for making depressing songs  
sound almost uplifting.

Virginian Luke Brindle opened with a good set of straight-ahead folk.  
The highlight, though, was a deft Turkish-flavored instrumental, which  
drew his biggest hand. Brindle was not the most dynamic performer - he  
may have been a bit discombobulated overall since he arrived late due  
to bad traffic and had a very late sound check.</pre></span>"

Singer-songwriter-guitarist Amy Speace's backing band is called the&nbsp; 
Tearjerks, but there is nothing maudlin or sentimental about her&nbsp; 
music.

On &quot;Haven't Learned a Thing,&quot; from her new album, &quot;The Killer in&nbsp; 
Me,&quot; Speace recalls various mistakes and dead ends. Finally, she&nbsp; 
shrugs, &quot;The only thing I've learned is that I haven't learned a&nbsp; 
thing.&quot;

In &quot;Something More Than Rain,&quot; she resists the temptation to wallow&nbsp; 
in despair and becomes philosophical: &quot;Always gotta find your way/ 
Always gonna look for home/Always gotta push that rock/Always gonna&nbsp; 
be alone.&quot;

Speace, who lives in Jersey City, established herself as a singer- 
songwriter to watch with her 2006 album, &quot;Songs for Bright Street,&quot;&nbsp; 
and will likely increase her following substantially with this album.

It's a dark, deeply personal album, with many songs growing out of&nbsp; 
Speace's separation from her husband. Producer-guitarist James&nbsp; 
Mastro (of the Bongos and the Health and Happiness Show) and&nbsp; 
engineer Mitch Easter (whose credits include R.E.M. and Pavement)&nbsp; 
help give the album a rough-edged, roots-rock sound that perfectly&nbsp; 
complements Speace's unsettling lyrics.

The haunting &quot;Would I Lie&quot; has a locomotive beat and a memorable&nbsp; 
opening line: &quot;This year my father's heroes have all passed/Ronald&nbsp; 
Reagan, June and Johnny Cash.&quot; Ian Hunter (of Mott the Hoople fame)&nbsp; 
is a suitably snarling duet partner on &quot;I Met My Love.&quot;

Speace is at her most accessible on &quot;Better,&quot; a catchy, upbeat song&nbsp; 
about yearning for something ... better. &quot;Haven't Learned a Thing&quot;&nbsp; 
is presented as a gentle, pensive ballad, with just Jane&nbsp; 
Scarpantoni's cello and Speace's acoustic guitar backing her voice,&nbsp; 
while &quot;The Weight of the World&quot; is just guitar and vocals.

&quot;The Weight of the World&quot; is listed as a bonus track, possibly&nbsp; 
because it's a tragic story about a soldier, and doesn't fit&nbsp; 
lyrically with the rest of the album. But with lines like &quot;He&nbsp; 
punched me in the arm to say goodbye/It's the first time that I saw&nbsp; 
our father cry,&quot; it's as affecting as anything else here.

Speace presents a free show at Liberty State Park in Jersey City,&nbsp; 
July 21 at 7 p.m. Call (201) 547-5000 or visit CityOfJerseyCity.com.

&quot;Sounding grounded but wounded, Speace exudes the vulnerability of  
someone who's loved and lost. Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople joins her  
for haunting harmonies on lines like, &quot;When you cut my heart like you  
got no shame / hurts so good, I want to share the blame.&quot; It's not  
quite iambic pentameter, but Speace has a flair for tragedy well- 
suited to someone with a background in Shakespeare.&quot;"

&quot;One of the best things about living in a major city are the sleeper&nbsp; 
shows that come our way. Amy Speace, a New York-based singer- 
songwriter is one of the latest. Her sophomore album, &quot;The Killer in&nbsp; 
Me,&quot; a deep, dark album full of lush, emotive lyrics, masterful&nbsp; 
acoustic guitar work and just the right mix of percussion to make up- 
tempo numbers such as &quot;Would I Lie?&quot; rock just right.&quot; - Nancy Dunham,&nbsp;

In fact,  after <a href=""http://www.americansongspace.com/amyspeace"" onclick=""javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.americansongspace.com');""> Amy Speace</a> visited us last week, we think it should be mandatory for us to  invite a songwriter up every week.

As she tuned her Gibson, the Jersey City  songstress chatted with us about Shakespeare, &ldquo;I guess my favorite stock  character would be the &lsquo;fool,&rsquo; because even though no one necessarily believes  or understands them, they&rsquo;re telling the truth.&rdquo;</p><br /><p style=""width: 409px;"" class=""style1"">Speace is no fool when it comes to  writing songs. She is an actress, playwright and poet by trade&ndash;working in the  National Shakespeare Company and in New York City&ndash;which is apparent in her heart  wrenching delivery of songs of her new album, <em>The Killer In Me</em>.</p><br /><p style=""width: 408px;"" class=""style1"">After playing the title track, she  continued warming up our office with her smile and charm. The song is deeply  introspective, at times bleak, but the hooks ache so good. And her next song  choice, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t Learned a Thing,&rdquo; reminded everyone in the room of the  continuous struggle to improve our lives and, especially, the relationships most  important to us. It was pretty heavy fare for before noon, yet somehow, by the  time Amy&rsquo;s finished playing, everything settled just right.</p><br /><p style=""width: 406px;"" class=""style1""><em>The Killer In Me </em>is out June 30.

It ran the gamut from tough to tender with style to spare and suggested its' creator was actually deserving of being mentioned in the same hallowed breath as the likes of Lucinda Williams and Roseanne Cash.

Speace's sophomore release, 'The Killer In Me' suggests she's keen to both consolidate and continue pushing forward. Still on hand are her trusty and inventive group The Tearjerks, featuring lead guitarist and producer James Mastro, although this time former REM producer Mitch Easter engineers. The Jayhawks' Gary Louris is absent this time around, although Mott The Hoople's Ian Hunter weighs in with a couple of gravelly duets and the immortally-named Kernersville Librarians' Choir (!) are roped in at one point. But more of that anon.

As with 'Songs For Bright Street', there's plenty to satisfy purists and renegades alike. Anyone desirous of quality, emotional bloodletting will be delighted with the slowburning ache of the title track, the chiming roots-imbued anthems like 'This Love' and the woman-scorned restlessness of 'Better'. Superior acoustic confessionals rear their pretty head too, with the sparse likes of 'Haven't Learned A Thing' clearly originating from lessons meted out at the school of hard knocks.

Once again, though, Speace and co. are keen to stretch the Americana-tinged boundaries. Sure, both 'Would I Lie?' and 'I Met My Love' are steeped in country, yet both present fascinating hybridised approaches. The former rushes along a rattling rockabilly rhythm, but mainlines on a punky aggression and a contemporary lyrical bent (""I'm angrier than I've ever been/ 'cause we're all throwing punches to the wind"") many of us can empathise with right now. 'I Met My Love', meanwhile, again has Ian Hunter growling away in support and seems overtly country on the surface, yet it has a bouncy, Eddy Cochran-style delivery and some great N'Awlins-influenced piano from John Bauer.

Elsewhere, it's often when Speace wanders even further off the recognised Alt. Country map that she really hits the spot. Thanks to a winning combination of wah-wah guitars, trombones, a smoky atmosphere and Jagoda's crisp drumming, 'Blue Horizon' is as close to Portishead territory as anything obviously Americana-related. 'Storm Warning' is even ghostlier and funky with Mastro's ARP strings and spectral guitars setting up the perfect melancholy atmosphere for Speace's anti-war commentary (""the telegram they brought today was brief and featherweight/ it said you'd died a soldier with a brave and quiet grace""). It's a perfect portrayal of love, loss and war wrapped up tight, yet still bleeding profusely.
	
The experimentation is infectious and kicks in again on 'Dirty Little Secret', where an apparently regular acoustic confessional is soon hi-jacked by a sitar, Jagoda's lunkheaded bursts of drumming and Mastro's subtle mellotron. Oh, and also an appearance by the enigmatic Kernersville Librarians' Choir I mentioned earlier. See, I told you they'd be wheeled out before I wrapped the review up.

Curiously, despite the wall to wall quality, Speace adds perhaps the album's finest moment as an afterthought. 'Weight of The World's isn't even listed as an official track on the sleeve and kicks in a good 30 seconds after the 'last' tune, 'Piece By Piece' has wound down. However, it's an intimate and vulnerable acoustic guitar and vocal excursion and its' explicit Iraq bereavement storyboard (""he went from the Land of the Free/ to being afraid, in disbelief"") is devastating, regardless of whether it's personal or not. I suspect it may well be.

'The Killer In Me', then, more than cements Amy Speace's reputation as one of Americana's most promising new talents. The most radical moments here, though, suggest she'll not be slow in continuing to take roots-related shapes and twist them to her own ends. Where she'll go from here will be fascinating to behold."

""Amy Speace has one of those fetching voices, the kind that taps you on the shoulder and motions seductively for you to follow it around corner after dark corner. You don't know where you're going to end up or how you'll ever find your way back, but that doesn't matter right now: you're enjoying the trip."" - Scott Brodeur, No Depression<br>

""If you thought that ""Songs For Bright Street"", her previous effort was already worth your attention, then this ""Killer In Me"" will certainly be an album you have to ad to your collection!"" - Mr Blue Boogie, BillyBop<br> 
<br> 
""Speace knows how to make a beautifully varied CD that builds a coherent unit through a wonderful balance of pop, rock and blues, ballads and up-tempo numbers that never bore you for a minute. A truly excellent and grown-up album."" - Moors Magazine<br>

The follow-up to her 2006 breakthrough 'Songs For Bright Street', 'Killer' finds the New York-based singer/songwriter forging into deeper, darker lyrical and musical terrain, borne largely out of the dissolution of her 10-year marriage.</p><p align=""left"">Speace wrote the songs on 'Killer' during a period self-imposed isolation in a rural cabin in the Catskills- a cathartic experience that helped her cope with her marital separation.</p><p align=""left"">The rural setting, Speace explains, &quot;forced me to sit with a lot of silence, fear and confusion and make a kind of peace with them by writing songs to keep from going crazy. That's when the album started making sense to me and became a whole different thing. Something shifted when I realized what was going on in the world outside mirrored what was going on inside of me, and I wanted to write songs that bridged that divide.&quot;</p><p align=""left"">The 12 songs on 'Killer' move through emotions from pain (&quot;Blue Horizon&quot;), codependency (&quot;The Killer In Me&quot;), remorse (&quot;Would I Lie&quot; &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;), regret (&quot;I Met My Love&quot;), to hope (&quot;This Love&quot;).</p><center><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;"" src=""http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.11NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyMzg1NTA5NzAzNDcmcHQ9MTIzODU1MDk4Njc2NiZwPTI3MDgxJmQ9dHVuZVdpZGdldF9maXJzdF9nZW4mZz*xJnQ9.gif"" /> <br /><lj-embed id=""5""/><br /><a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/c./a4/19/35049/Artist/7717/Label/link""><img width=""434"" height=""19"" border=""0"" alt=""Amy%20Speace"" src=""http://cache.reverbnation.com/widgets/content/19/footer.png"" /></a><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""visibility: hidden; width: 0px; height: 0px;"" src=""http://www.reverbnation.com/widgets/trk/19/artist_35049/label_7717/t.gif"" /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.quantcast.com/p-05---xoNhTXVc""><img width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" alt=""Quantcast"" style=""display: none;"" src=""http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-05---xoNhTXVc.gif"" /></a></center> <br /><p align=""left"">Musically, Amy Speace embraces the lyric-focused emotions of folk music, but breaks the genre's mold with bellowing horns and organ and twangy electric guitars. Again, Speace is joined by longtime producer and lead guitarist James Mastro (of Bongos/Health and Happiness Show fame) and her band the Tearjerks (guitarist Rich Feridun, bassist Matt Lindsey and drummer Jagoda). English rock icon Ian Hunter is new to the crew lending vocals to two songs.</p><p align=""left"">A New Jersey transplant, Speace originally had her sites set on becoming a playwright and actor after college, touring with the National Shakespeare Company and teaching in NYC. She taught herself to play guitar, started writing songs, and hit the road booking as many shows across the country as possible while raising money to record her self-released 2002 album 'Fable'.</p><p align=""left"">A SXSW performance caught the eye of Judy Collins and in 2006 Collins' Wildflower Records released Speace's debut 'Songs For Bright Street'. The album grabbed the attention of industry tastemakers including WFUV's John Platt, while No Depression said, &quot;Amy Speace has one of those fetching voices, the kind that taps you on the shoulder and motions seductively for you to follow it around corner after dark corner. You don't know where you're going to end up or how you'll ever find your way back, but that doesn't matter right now: you're enjoying the trip.&quot;</p><p align=""left""><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amyspeace.com"">http://www.amyspeace.com</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Amy-Speace/6091046107"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Amy-Speace/6091046107</a> </p>"

"event","I'm sending out my April Newsletter a wee bit early, as we've added  <br />some shows and I wanted to let everyone know about some special co- <br />bills coming up!!  March certainly lived up to its poetic potential,  <br />coming in with the snow and seemingly out with the sun. Feel like I've  <br />been bouncing between both in my travels lately, from Florida to  <br />Minnesota to Texas. We had a great week at South By Southwest in  <br />Austin, hanging with friends, listening to great bands, eating tacos,  <br />drinking margaritas. Oh, yes, and we played our own shows. That's  <br />right. That was the point (or was it???).<br /><br />While we await the dropping of the new record (yes, damnit, I'm gonna  <br />call it a record), I've got some duo and solo shows coming up. And I'm  <br />sharing the stage with some amazing folks. During Tin Pan South Week  <br />in Nashville, I'll be playing the Americana Music Association's show  <br />at The Mercy Lounge with the great Ray Wylie Hubbard and Mike Farris.  <br />In the round with those boys. Holy cow.... Also I'll be making my Iron  <br />Horse Music Hall debut in Northampton, MA with Terri Hendrix and Lloyd  <br />Maines (James Mastro will be joining me). And I've got 2 shows with my  <br />good friend Anthony DaCosta.<br /><br />I taped a show for Musicfog.com at Folk Alliance with Jessie Scott and  <br />played &quot;The Killer In Me&quot; with a very sleep-deprived Rich Feridun and  <br />a giddy Steve Poltz hanging around in the background. Please go check  <br />it out!. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEjONxks6uA<br /><br />And for those of you in Europe, &quot;The Killer In Me&quot; hits stores on  <br />April 6th!!! (US/Canada....June 23rd is the release date).<br /><br />So come to the shows and get some Vitamin A.<br /><br />:) Amy<br />http://www.amyspeace.com/tour.html<br /><br />"

<p align=""left"">Grassy Hill Entertainment singer-songwriter Amy Speace will be spending her Valentine's Day opening for The Bacon Brothers during two sold out shows at Pennsylvania's Sellersville Theater.
<p align=""left"">WHAT: Amy Speace opens for The Bacon Brothers
<p align=""left"">WHEN: Saturday February 14, 2009<BR>2 shows - 6pm and 9pm, Both sold out!
<p align=""left"">WHERE: Sellersville Theater 1894<BR>24 West Temple Avenue<BR>Sellersville, PA
<p align=""left"">Philly natives Kevin & Michael Bacon have written & played music together for over twenty years and have become one of the country's hottest live bands with successful, sold-out performances across the country. The Bacon Brothers perform an enticing mixture of folk, rock, soul and country. In addition to their band, Michael has won numerous awards for his musical scores for films & TV including numerous Emmys and two Academy Awards while Kevin is recognized around the world as one of Hollywood's most enduring and acclaimed actors.
<p align=""left"">Amy Speace has already won a loyal grass-roots fan base, thanks in large part to live performances that merge warmth, humor and emotional immediacy, and to a tireless touring schedule that's already taken her across the United States. She's also won considerable critical acclaim, with The Village Voice observing that Speace is ""taking her Americana away from twangy contemplation toward tangy confrontation"" and noting that she's ""not another of those breathy would-be child poets, but a real singing writer of songs."" Time Out New York stated, ""Amy Speace plays sweet, twangy folk music with a clear voice and an innocent vulnerability,"" while The Nashville Scene noted that she ""balances wry humor with open-hearted honesty."" And renowned Nashville critic Robert K. Oermann, writing in Music Row, dubbed her a ""new star.""<BR><a href=""http://www.amyspeace.com"" target=""_blank"">http://www.amyspeace.com</a><BR><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/amyspeace"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/amyspeace</a>"

"event","<br /><p class=""blogContent"">I've been to the promised land three times in a row and have come back cleaned, washed from the river. This year I come back ridden with chiggers--a totally unfortunate name and one we should change. Mostly just these red welts. Look like big skeeter bites from my Minnesoter past. They don't bother me much. Kinda like the crick in my neck I had from the tentsleeping that Kristin and the massage lady on the hill couldn't rid me of that has gone south to my lower back assbone that the chinese acupressure lady who speaks no english but just digs her fingers in and says ""ok?"" very loudly to me on Grove Street in Jersey City has maybe alleviated a bit more now that I'm back on the East ""hotter than Texas"" Coast. Goddamn its sweltering. The trees threatened to break the lights out last night as the hot sky broke open over Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side and we all stood out looking up, like that photo of me right there. Looking up, just hoping. Not caring that a stray branch might break on our pate. Jersey was lights out for 24 hours and the train was busted under the river, but I drove my gasguzzlingmotherfucker of a van across and under to get to my show and then back on nothingfumes and filled up for $80 and thought about the days of my ford focus and how it cost me about $12 to fill that one up and that was the year I first quit my mcjob to do this life and now here I am in the 9th inning stretch and wondering about how feasible this is with the gas crisis and life costs and all that's shifting. <br /><br />People come and go and its all for the best but it just sucks and you wish it could all be the same but it ain't so you move on. <br /><br />I miss my tent on the nonexistent creek this year, with my morning coffees in the Texas heat. I wrote a song with Byrd. I can barely play it but I know by playing it I'll get better and I love the song. I heard songs I want to learn to play. There was one by Chuck Brodsky that made me put the guitar down and happily just be listener. There were hummingbirds at Coho and fajitas and harmonica lessons and all sorts of loveliness and love out there in the hills. Kerrville is a mighty place. Changes my life and twists me up every time.<br /><br />I had the great privilege of singing in Lorin Maazel's private theater this week. Maazel is the conductor of the NYC Philharmonic, a musical world I never have the privilege of lingering in and among. I sang in a concert for Paul Reisler's music, alongside Sweet Honey In The Rock's Ysaye Barnwell and musical crazygenius harmonica player Howard Levy. These folks have become friends after sharing music with them over the years through Paul's songs, but this concert was special as it was in this extraordinary theater, for an extraordinary community that supports the arts like no other, supports each other. You could feel the warmth, quite literally, from them. We were invited to stay on the premises and I stayed in a guest house that abutted what seems to be a little zoo, that featured Omar the camel. A camel. In Virginia. A few llamas and alpacas (what is the difference?), ponys, donkeys, a zebra and a zonkey, the result of ambition. <br /><br />So the sand shifts, we find new alliances, we leave the old sadly but for the best and we move on. And we end up waking up with good coffee, staring at a Zonkey.</p>"

"event","Hi all,<br /><br />Sorry to bother you twice in one day, but we've got a load of shows coming up with some holes in there and some of you have asked me about house concerts, so here are the holes and here are the areas we'll be in. If you're new to House Concerts, they are really amazing ways of hosting music in your home. Simply, you just need to have a space large enough to hold about 30 people, either seated on chairs or couches, or on pillows, or outside. We can play as the full band, unplugged, or I could play solo unplugged or plugged in. I can help send you information that would make it really easy to host one.   <br /><br />Thursday June 19th or Sunday June 22nd: Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, NY.  I'm en route to Ontario for shows on June 20th and 21st and would love to play shows en route up and back.<br /><br />Sunday July 20th: DC, MD, Northern VA area <br />Tuesday, July 22nd: DC, MD, Northern VA area  (you might be able to have The Tearjerks for your bbq!)<br /><br />If anyone is interested, please email me directly at <a href=""mailto:amy@amyspeace.com""><b>amy@amyspeace.com</b></a> and also my booking manager <a href=""mailto:Margo@grassyhillentertainment.com""><b>Margo@grassyhillentertainment.com</b></a> who is the Queen of scheduling!!!<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Amy"

"event","With the red dirt of Kerrville still dusting everything from the lines of my sunburnt face to the worn toes of my old boots, I'm trying to ""land"" back here on the East Coast, but its hard. Texas has its thumbs in me. I was honored (and challenged) to share the judging duties with Jud Caswell and Mike Williams at the famed New Folk Songwriters Contest at the Kerrville Folk Festival over Memorial Day Weekend. I heard some amazing music by all of the finalists, winners and non-winners both. Just getting there is an honor in itself and it was an honor for me to sit on the panel with Jud and Mike. I hosted Ballad Tree in the hot afternoon sun and then spent the next week on staff at the Kerrville Song School, teaching alongside Pat Pattison, Rick Beresford and Johnsmith, among others, and had a wonderful time. I also joined Dave Crossland, Jon Vezner onstage for backup singing and was pulled onstage for an impromptu appearance during Jimmy LaFave's set! So many friends and great music...I'd still be at Quiet Valley Ranch if I could. The winding gentle lulling of the Medina, my cozy corner at Camp Nashville's Back Porch, the morning hummingbirds at Camp Coho, 4am dark singing with Brian up at Crow's Nest, starlit road jams....I miss it already. But June is a bustin' out all over and we've got songs, new and old, to share. From Pennsylvania to Ontario to New York City.

"event","Hi all,<br />When I was a wee lass, I had this dream. I wanted to be ""On Broadway"". I used to practice ""N.Y.C."" at the top of my lungs from the Annie soundtrack and then later, anything from Chorus Line and then later, anything Sondheim wrote. Then I went to college, discovered Suzanne Vega and R.E.M., got a guitar, and decided I wanted to be, well, what I'm being right now. This Friday, May 16th, I will have the opportunity to play at NYC's Town Hall, opening for Judy Collins. It's less than a block off Broadway, so I think its safe to say, I can do my little joy dance and feel like at least one thing I can cross off the life list (skydiving might be next).<br /><br />If you can't make Town Hall, we're playing around the NYC area this weekend at a bunch of other great shows. Please come out and see us!<br /><br />xoxo<br />amy<br /><a href=""http://www.amyspeace.com"">www.amyspeace.com</a><br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/amyspeace"">www.myspace.com/amyspeace</a><br /><br />Friday May 16 at8pm<br /> TOWN HALL """"Not Just Jazz"" series<br /> With Judy Collins   <br />123 West 43rd Street, NYC<br />   <br />Saturday May 17 at 1:30pm (free show)<br /> Everything Jersey City Festival<br />  On Central Avenue in the Jersey City Heights<br />Jersey City, NJ   <br />With the Tearjerks<br /><br />Saturday May 17 at 7:30pm (buy tickets today on line as this might sell out!!!!!_<br /> Music at The Mission Concert Series <br /> With The Tearjerks.

Gathering nine tracks from performances on Ft. Collins' KRFC 88.9 FM, NY's WFUV 90.7 FM and Boston's WMBR 88.1 FM, as well as syndicated show The Art of Song, the album is available for download at <a href=""http://www.musicdish.net/amyspeace/mp3/"" target=""_blank"">www.musicdish.net/amyspeace/mp3/</a><br /></p><p align=""left"">John Platt's three-hour tour of tunes strikes a balance between the ""Joni Mitchells/Harry Chapins/Jackson Brownes"" and ""lesser-known but equally talented"" singer/songwriters. Guests have ranged from icons like Pete Seeger, Joan Baez,  Loudon Wainwright, and Judy Collins, to WFUV mainstays like Dar Williams, Bruce Cockburn, and Luka Bloom, to emerging artists like Richard Julian, Sonya Kitchell, and Ben Taylor.  With his gentle probing John helps us to know more about the music - and who the artists are as people.<br /></p><p align=""left"">From the rustic rush of ""Step Out of the Shade"" to the bittersweet lilt of ""Water Landing"" to the gentle acoustic intimacy of ""Two,"" Songs for Bright Street's 12 original compositions (plus a slyly countrified reading of the Blondie classic ""Dreaming"") showcase Speace's unique gifts, offering catchy Americana with indelible hooks, sharply observed lyrics and a gritty urban edge. Among those impressed by her sassy songcraft is legendary folk-pop songstress Judy Collins, who chose Songs for Bright Street to release on her new Wildflower label.<br /></p><p align=""left"">Amy Speace has already won a loyal grass-roots fan base, thanks in large part to live performances that merge warmth, humor and emotional immediacy, and to a tireless touring schedule that's already taken her across the United States. She's also won considerable critical acclaim, with The Village Voice observing that Speace is ""taking her Americana away from twangy contemplation toward tangy confrontation"" and noting that she's ""not another of those breathy would-be child poets, but a real singing writer of songs."" Time Out New York stated, ""Amy Speace plays sweet, twangy folk music with a clear voice and an innocent vulnerability,"" while The Nashville Scene noted that she ""balances wry humor with open-hearted honesty."" And renowned Nashville critic Robert K. Oermann, writing in Music Row, dubbed her a ""new star.""<br /></p><p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.amyspeace.com"" target=""_blank"">www.amyspeace.com</a><br /></p>"

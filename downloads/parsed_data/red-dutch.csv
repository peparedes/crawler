"event","ok - now it has got to end.  anyone want to buy a house???  i gotta get out of this neighborhood.  or i will end up in the looney bin.

why do dome parents feel the need to ignore that fact that their ""angels"" are actually HELLIONS.  don't tell me about my kids using ""bad words"" when i hear the same filth coming from your son's mouth.  i don't come over there and tell you that you need to do something about YOUR kids - ""take the log out of your eye before you worry about the speck in mine"".  what are these kids going to do in the REAL world?  when mom and dad aren't there to protect them.  or to make decisions for them?  they will be lost!!!

shut up and take care of your kids - i'll take care of mine.  i know my kids are no angels - i'll be the first to admit it.  but there is only just so much you can do.  you tell them all you want - you can spank/punish them.  it's only until/unless the kid decides to make the correct choices.  you can't make it for them.  i am not saying to let an 8 yr old fend for themselves, but you can't be with them 24/7.  are you going to follow them to school and do the same thing??

i just want them to leave me alone.  why do they feel the need to rag on me?  why don't they just say ""we think you're being bad parents"" to me?  why just to my wife?  i am betting because they don't have the guts.  they know i throw it back in their faces - i've done it before - i'll do it again.  

i just hate people like that.  friggin' nosey bastards.  mind your own business already!!"

"event","why is it that every parents kids are angels???  why is it that they think everyone elses kids are the ones causing trouble.  just cause their kid didn't get busted for ""fighting with sticks"" - or at least their kid didn't get busted for STARTING THE WHOLE MESS.  they only see the kid defending himself.  and of course it has to be my kid.  their kids don't tell the parents WHY they got hit by my kid.  was it because their 2 kids and 2 more of their friends were beatin' on him FIRST??  they conveniently left that out when they told their dad what happened.  my kid was defending himself against 4....  and got 2 of them, so i figure he did pretty well, considering the odds.

tonight i will have a little ""CHAT"" with those 2 kids and let them know that if they don't tell their parents what REALLY happened - then i will.  they have until the weekend.  after that i tell their parents and see what happens when they get busted lying.  the little $h!t$.

yeah - my kids no angel.  first thing i ask when comes in the house when he's hurt is what did he do to get whoever to do this to him.  ok that's the second - the 1st is ""are you ok?"".  i have told him over & over ""tell me the 100% truth and i will stick up for you - lie to me and it's all over"".  that's usually gets the truth.  and knowing the 2 of the other boys - i figure he's REAL close on his story.  they've done this before and to other kids...  >:-(

people who do this crap for their ""angels"" REALLY piss me off."

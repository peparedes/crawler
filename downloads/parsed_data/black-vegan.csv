<lj-cut>

Even though saying sorry isn't enough for what I did I'll say it anyway. 

Our paths have parted and should never cross again, ever. I'm sorry. 

Please stay away from me and my loved ones. Let me live in peace so I can work things out. 



I need a long break from LJ. I'll try to respond to the comments left in my LJ by my friends at a later date. I need to ease my mind for a bit. Thanks.

It feels good to be back home in Los Angeles. </lj-cut>"

In 1984, Reagan declared the third Sunday in July National Ice Cream Day.

In 2006, were taking it back! Join Chicago Soydairy this July 16th for an amazing all-vegan Temptation vegan ice cream blowout to benefit Compassion
Over Killing (COK). Grab your Frisbee, kickball, your whiffle ball and your flip-flops and spend a Sunday out in the sun with the boys of the Soydairy and beat the heat with their mind-bendingly tasty Temptation
frozen desserts.

Who: You, your mother, your best friend and that cute vegan you met on the train.

When: July 16th  1-5pm

Where: Foster Ave Beach, Chicago, IL (same as last fundraiser)

Why: Because its summer, the Temptation is wicked tasty, and we have an excuse called National Ice Cream Day and the moneys going to a good cause.
I mean, seriously. I think the question is: Why not?

If youre not familiar with Compassion Over Killing (COK), they pretty much rule. Their undercover investigations, litigation and vegan outreach 
are among the most creative and effective animal rights efforts in the country--visit www.COK.net to learn more."

Today was a good day. Spring is definitely here and summer is well on its way. It was bright and sunny today, I am glad I had the day off. As usual however my weekend is packed with work. I can't complain I am happy to be working even if I don't like the hours sometimes. Nevertheless, everyone seems to have spring fever including myself. Lots of pollen in the air among other things. ;)

It feels good to make amends with old and new friends, it's really hard sometimes to keep in touch. As they say, ""never burn down a bridge you have crossed."" You never know when you may have to go back and use that 'bridge' again."

Hello, brothers and sisters across our amazing world,

    Pardon me for having been out of touch for longer than usual.  I was traveling in early May, and then for three weeks had substantial difficulty getting my computer work done.  First, there were problems relating to the
Chinese government's tweaking of its firewall (expats here quip it is ""the Great [Fire]Wall of China"") and its internet censorship and surveillance programs.  Then, Hotmail itself went down.  The outage coincided with President Hu Jiantao's visit to Microsoft in the US. The Chinese pulled the plug until Microsoft gave them what they wanted.  There was an apology posted on MSN about the ""bumps"" with their products, not just here in China but across the board; so perhaps Microsoft happened to have glitches of its own as well.  In addition, my university's network is overloaded and needs revamping.  On top of that, electrical current problems at the building where the English teachers have our computers damaged two hard drives. It took a week to get repairs.  Because of China's frequent internet problems, going to an internet cafe was of little help. I am catching up on accumulated, correspondence, and happy to share news with you - most of which is happier than the computer annoyances I have just reported. I have learned that my emails have been coming to some of you looking odd, with unnecessary hard returns at the end of each line. I will see if there is a text wrap-around feature that prevents this.  If your receive this email and it looks funky, and would like to have a MS Word version of it, let me know and I will send a Word file.
    
   Thinking of computer frustrations:  The May 11 issue of the English-language newspaper ""China Daily"" includes an article about a poll of office workers in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.  The survey found that workplace dissatisfaction, measured both by self-reports and by employee sick leave, increased significantly with the age of the computer equipment the employees use. I can understand that.
    
   May Day is a major holiday in China.It is a week-long observance. The university shut down, not unlike ""spring break"" in America, although many students stayed on campus since they are from Wuhan city anyway. It is one of three such major holiday, the other two being the three-week-long Lunar New Year celebration, and National Day week at the beginning of October. May Day week is also called Golden Week, as it is a time of travel and shopping. The government measures consumer spending during the period, in the same way that Christmas shopping is monitored in the US as a sign of
how healthy the economy is.
    
   My students asked how many days Americans get off for May Day holiday. They did not believe me when I said that we have our own Labor Day in September and do not honor International Workers Day. They insisted, ""But it is all over the world!  All people have the socialist workers day!""  Even educated people in China are astoundingly ignorant of how the rest of the world lives. But the same can be said of some Americans. On May Day itself, I went to the English teachers resource room. As I walked in, I heard the strains of the ""Internationale.""  A fellow teacher who comes from England, and whose own college major was Russian language,
downloaded an MP3 file of a Russian choir singing the classic, and was playing it over the PC speakers. He and I had a great laugh at the timeliness of this.
    
   During the May holiday I did a little sightseeing around town. There was a flower show along the Yangtze River park in Hankou Borough. Then I walked along the river promenade in my district of Wuchang, and across the famous ""first bridge over the Yangzte"" built in 1955-1957 by a Soviet-Chinese collaboration. It is double-decked. The lower level has rail lines, while the upper deck carries auto traffic and pedestrians. The views of the city, and of Yellow Crane Tower on Snake Hill where the bridge touches, are splendid by local standards - which is to say, a little hazy, because Wuhan almost perpetually sits under a pall of air pollution. In the
gift shop at the Riverside Holiday Inn near the north end of the bridge, in Hangyang Borough, I at last found postcards of scenes around Wuhan. Postcards are hard to come by in Wuhan, which is not on the tourist track. I was mostly interested to buy pictures of the skyline, which being often obscured by smoke comes out very poorly in my own photographs.

    Later in the May Day week I joined the chemistry department faculty and their families for a trip to Tuan Feng Shan. This is a four-hour bus ride to the northeast of Wuhan near the border of Hubei Province with Anhui Province. It is a lovely area of rolling hills with small terraced rice fields, giving way to 1500-meter rocky pinnacles and gushing waterfalls. The air is fresh, the water clean, an invigorating change from heavily polluted Wuhan. It is not a famous tourist site, which is why the department selected it for a faculty retreat: we would not be among crowds. There is no regular bus service, so we chartered a bus.  Our group of 40 teachers and their families were almost the only visitors there. A nearby village has a few small hotels, with several more under construction, apparently in the hope the place will become a thriving tourist destination. In the meantime, while the area remains undiscovered by the throngs that fill better-known sites on the holidays, it remains nearly pristine and most pleasant.
    
   The trip was my first excursion outside a big Chinese city. It was fascinating to see the farmers working their fields, in wide-brimmed straw hats, sometimes with water buffalo pulling implements; tractors were rare. Taoist shrines dot the countryside.  We walked along a gushing mountain river through a rocky ravine, where a small Taoist temple (To Di Miao) was located, the valley itself being called Shen Xian Gu, ""a place for the supernatural beings to dwell.""  At the inns where we stayed, the food was marvelous. I got to try many kinds of dishes that were new to me. (The bacon was almost entirely fat, alas.)  The rural folk who run the little hotels were friendly and attentive.  The rooms were modern and comfortable, but then, the hotels are new.  Local women selling mushrooms and bamboo
stalks collected in the mountains did a brisk business with our group, and our bus came back laden with produce. My colleagues explained they like the quality of the items that grow in the pure mountain soil.

    The Chinese have a concept of orienting one's surroundings to increase the flow of good and auspicious energy. It is called Feng Shui, literally, ""wind and water.""  Feng Shui is folk geomancy, but contains a sound aesthetic. Experiencing the vistas and the interplay of stone, pine trees, water, sunlight, and air atop Tuan Feng Shan, I got a gut sense of what ""good feng shui"" means. The idea has real meaning for me now.
    
  Here are some vignettes of life in China. Basketball is so popular here that it never ceases to amaze me. The thump thump thump thump of balls being dribbled on the court across from my apartment building (where we practice tai chi) begins in the morning and continues late into the night, even though the lighting is poor and I wonder how the players can see to take their shots. I have seen people playing basketball in flip flops, in jeans, and even in business attire, though those better equipped for the activity often choose shorts and tops made of a glistening and light-weight linen that looks like silk.  Late one night I told some other English teachers from abroad who live in my building that I would like to have a BB gun to shoot the ball so the players would give up and go home. I was told that may not discourage them: these teachers once watched someone playing with a basketball so poorly inflated it could barely bounce. Some of the young men play basketball even when they are not playing basketball. While waiting for friends or at a bus stop they pantomime the motions of dribbling and shooting.

    At the main vehicle entrance to Hubei University there are guards who direct traffic using red and green flags. Two guards stand facing each other on opposite sides of the gate. When the guards change shifts, they perform a little ceremony.  The two who are going off duty salute one another. The two who are coming on duty march smartly up, salute one another, then turn to salute the guards they are replacing. They receive the directing flags, and then the two guards who are leaving turn and salute one another before walking, in a British army kind of step, to the guardhouse. The changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace is probably more spectacular, but this ritual is done in such earnest and with flare that it delights me.
    
   In mid-semester the university changed its schedule for afternoon
classes. Now on Tuesdays I teach a class that ends at 6:00 pm and another that begins at 7:00. I live close enough to the buildings where these classes are to zip back to the apartment and made a very fast dinner. This week, however, a student lingered for a nice conversation after my late afternoon class. Since I was by the university's west gate where food vendors are active across the street, I rushed there to buy some dumplings for my dinner. One of my evening class students saw me and walked back across the street with me. He asked if I was going up to our classroom. I had planned to sit in a nearby garden area and hurriedly eat my dinner before going to the classroom. I asked if it is acceptable to take food into the buildings. (I had just never had occasion to do so before and did not know the protocol.) He said it was OK, so we went to the classroom. I put my styrofoam container of dumplings on the podium and, while writing some sentences on the chalkboard for the class, would reach over and, using the wooden disposable chopsticks that are always provided with Chinese carryout, pop dumplings into my mouth.  Once I glanced up at the students who were beginning to assemble for the class, and saw them watching me with rapt attention and broad grins. They were witnessing the answer to a burning question they had: Can Americans use chopsticks?

    Roses, particularly in shades of red and pink, are a popular decorative plant in China. I used to think of roses as an exotic and uncommon flower that is difficult to grow.  The Chinese know how to do roses right and abundantly. They are planted in smaller clumps of bushes and in larger beds around the university campus and all across Wuhan city. When one variety fades, another comes into bloom. It is wonderful.

    China, the fountainhead of East Asian culture, has its parent form of bonsai, called here ""pun-sai.""  While the Japanese creations look like miniature trees, the Chinese form, or at least the Wuhanian kind, emphasizes the rugged, gnarled root structures, with little twig branches bearing leaves (or pine needles) coming out of the roots. These are sometimes placed with tiny models of pagodas in trays to resemble landscapes, while others are left without the accouterments to intimate dragons and coiled serpents. (Snakes, by the way, are sometimes referred to in China as ""little dragons."")

    One of my best students came up to me excitedly after a class and said, ""I'm joining the Communist Party!"" To him it was an achievement like being pledged to the best fraternity on campus. To progress in any career, one has to be a member of the Party. One cannot go to postgraduate school or become a university professor unless one is a member of the Party. A professor told me about encouraging her daughter to join the Party in order to get some training in leadership, almost in the same way an American high school or university student might run for student council or join the
debating team because it looks good on one's resume.

    On the other hand, another student came up to me after a class, having hung back and waited until the other students had departed, and asked, in a quiet voice, ""Is it important to be a member of a political party in America?""  I said that many people are politically interested, but party membership is not an important identity for most Americans; that, indeed, some Americans, myself included, take pride in being ""independent,"" not affiliated with any party. He told me why he had asked: he had to join the Communist Party in order to continue his academic career, but loathed the time he had to invest to attend the boring meetings with hackneyed speeches.

    One can buy sausages on a stick from street vendors, and I have tried this, although passing on having the hot chili sauce brushed on. But it did not substitute for a Chicago-style hot dog or Polish sausage on a poppyseed bun with relish, diced tomatoes and onions, and a big pickle slice! While I like Chinese food, I do sometimes feel cravings for favorite foods from the States, Chicago dogs among them.
    
    Advertisements for replica watches and other goods sneak through the Hotmail spam filter. When I see them in my inbox, before deleting them I have a little chuckle since unlicensed knockoffs of name brand watches, shoes, clothing, and electronics, and pirated CDs, DVDs, and computer software, can be bought at shops and street vendors anywhere in China.

    Boxes of incense, smelling like the standard Chinese incense one can buy at the temples, and which is sold in Chicago's Chinatown, are placed as air fresheners in the public toilets on campus, where they are definitely needed to try to cover (albeit unsuccessfully) the smell of sewage. The incense actually comes from the Buddhist supply trade. It is done up in paper boxes with a Chinese-style picture of the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, as he is called in Sanskrit, or Ti Tsang Wang Pu Sa, in Chinese. This bodhisattva's special vow is to deliver the spirits suffering in the various purgatories. He is a popular figure in Chinese Buddhism, for ancestor reverence is the underlying force below Chinese folk religion.

<img src=http://www.geocities.com/directx_user/gallery/ksitigarbha.jpg />

    Recently I again went to Guiyuan Temple, along with two of my students who wanted to go and suggested we go together. I am discovering that a great many people in Wuhan, even the younger people, like to occasionally go to the temples to pay respects to the Buddhas. They do so with genuine reverence. It was inspiring to me to kneel down alongside my students, our palms pressed together in front of our chests - the ""anjali"" (Sanskrit) or ""gassho"" (Japanese) gesture is called ""kung shou"" in Chinese - and then, in unison, slowly offer three bows to the Buddha. I and my students talked
wistfully about how peaceful a life it would be to become monks.

    It was a hot day, and at Guiyuan Temple the monks had shed their
full-length yellow and brown cold-weather robes for practical warm-weather uniforms: short-sleeved saffron shirts, yellow shorts coming to just below the knees, and tan cloth sandals with the toes covered. They looked cute in this kind of outfit, which I had never seen before. Two monks, an older and a younger one, were collecting the money from the donation boxes. The older one dumped the trays of currency and coins into a large red sack which the younger one slung over his shoulder, looking like Santa carrying a red bag full of goodies. We observed a chanting ritual in which an elderly monk
waved a license plate and a set of car keys through the smoke of burning incense, while a man knelt on a cushion before the altar.  Afterward the man retrieved the license plate and keys, and gave the monk a 100 yuan bill. He was having his car blessed! Not a bad idea, given how crazily motorists in China drive.

    The Buddhas, Bodhsattvas, Lohan (Buddha's disciples, called ""Arhats"" in Sanskrit), and Dharma-Protector Kings depicted in Chinese Buddhist temples are principally Indian imports, although some indigenous heroes are included in the Chinese Mahayana pantheon. In most cases, whether Indian or Chinese in origin, the figures are sculpted or painted with Chinese features. The many-armed Kuan-yin statues look very Indian in body, and as to the auspicious emblems and weapons each hand holds, but her face has Chinese features. While much of the physiognomy of the Buddha figures are East Asian, the ""lakshanas,"" the identifying marks of greatness corresponding to
ancient Indian ideas of beauty and palmistry and enumerated in the Buddhist scriptures, are also evident on the statues; for example, the elongated earlobes (a sign of royal descent, the ears being distended from wearing heavy earrings), and the three folds of flesh on Buddha's neck. Many years ago, when I was a kid, I thought Buddhism was a CHINESE religion, and only in high school got it right that Buddhism began in India. One of my Chicago friends who comes from Hong Kong has said that when he was a little kid, he found the figures in the temples to be creepy and scary. The fierce mien of the Dharma-Kings signifies wrath against evil and ignorance, but just to look at them, they are intimidating. I would be afraid, too, if I were a young child taken into the semi-darkness of a hushed building with these huge menacing figures looming over me.

<img src=http://www.warriortours.com/china-photos/wuhan/hubei.wuhan.guiyuan.temple.50016897w.jpg />

    I remarked in an earlier email travelogue that the Buddhism of everyday people here is a folk practice, mainly consisting of prayers for health and wealth. The same is true for Thai and Tibetan Buddhists. Westerners who are new to Buddhism have the chance to make it anew in our own societies, returning the emphasis to a practice aimed at attaining enlightenment for oneself and others. Buddhism at its best is a life of mental training, gentle words, and benevolent deeds.

     It is now Buddha's birthday time.  In Chicago and across the United States, Buddhist temples and centers are alive with celebrations. Buddhism continues in China in a low-key way. In this officially atheistic country where religion is frowned upon and sometimes actively persecuted by the authorities, devotees keep their heads down. I am struck by how much more vibrant and fresh Buddhism seems in its new home in America, where a pioneering spirit prevails.  I dearly love seeing the temples and pagodas here. But I also miss being back among the Buddhist community in Chicagoland, sharing fellowship, meditating, and serving in the regional Buddhist Council.  I send my best wishes for all of your Wesak/Visakha celebrations this year!

    It is a source of endless fascination to be in China watching,
listening, questioning people about the things I observe, and trying to make sense of it all.  There are layers upon layers to unravel, and I will keep you up posted on my adventures.

    Happy Memorial Day and Happy Gay Pride to my friends in the States. I cannot be there to parade and picnic this year, but my heart is with you. To my friends and colleagues everywhere, many blessings and much love.

Tom

James Doohan (""Scotty"") passed away at his home in Redmond, Washington this morning. He was 85.

<lj-cut>
Doohan died at 5:30 a.m. (13:30 GMT) with his wife of 28 years, Wende, at his side. According to Doohan's Los Angeles agent and longtime friend Steve Stevens, the cause of death was pneumonia and Alzheimer's disease.

James Doohan was best known to Star Trek fans as Scotty (""Montgomery Scott""), the chief engineer aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise, in the original Star Trek series.

Doohan was born on March 3, 1920, in Vancouver, British Columbia, and spent his early years in there and in Sarnia, Ontario. Surviving the anguish of living with an alcoholic father, he left home at age 19 to join the Canadian Forces, fighting with the Allies in World War II. After outscoring his fellow soldiers on an officer's exam, he became Captain in the Royal Canadian Artillery. While leading his men into battle on D-Day, Doohan was wounded in the leg and hand, and eventually lost a finger. For the remainder of the war, he became a pilot observer, and received the dubious distinction of being called the ""craziest pilot in the Canadian Air Forces.""

After returning home to Canada, Doohan performed a few scenes for the local radio station, and was awarded a two-year scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. Beginning in 1946, he trained at the Playhouse with Sanford Meisner, alongside such future stars as Leslie Nielsen, Tony Randall and Jackie Gleason.

In the ensuing eight years, Doohan shuttled between New York and Canada where he worked on 4000 radio programs, 400 live and taped variety and dramatic television shows, several films and plays. Though he became known as Canada's busiest actor, he eventually found himself following other fellow actors in the pilgrimage to Hollywood. There, his versatility and talent as a dialectician helped him earn parts in more than 100 motion pictures and television series, including The Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, Fantasy Island, ""Loaded Weapon 1"" and ""Double Trouble."" He has also appeared in the first seven Star Trek motion pictures.

In the years since the final episode of Star Trek, Doohan has pursued a speaking career which has taken him to more than 250 colleges throughout the U.S. and Canada. In addition, he makes appearances at numerous Star Trek conventions.

Doohan lived in Redmond, Washington, with his wife Wende and his sons, Eric and Thomas. In April 2000, James and Wende gave birth to another child, Sarah.

James Doohan passed away on July 20, 2005 at his home. Wende, his wife of 28 years, was at his side.

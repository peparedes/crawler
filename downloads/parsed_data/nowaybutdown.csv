When I get to Warwick Avenue
Meet me by the entrance of the tube
We can talk things over a little time
Promise me you won't step outta line

When I get to Warwick Avenue
Please drop the past and be true
Don't think we're okay, just because I'm here
You hurt me bad, but I won't shed a tear

I'm leaving you for the last time baby
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I've been confused outta my mind lately
You think you're loving but I want to be free
Baby you've hurt me

When I get to Warwick Avenue
We'll spend an hour, but no more than two
Our only chance to speak once more
I showed you the answers, now here's the door

When I get to Warwick Avenue
I'll tell you baby that we're through

I'm leaving you for the last time baby
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I've been confused outta my mind lately
You think you're loving but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby you've hurt me

All the days spent together, I wished for better
But I didn't want the train to come
Now it's departed
I'm broken hearted, seems like we never started
All those days spent together, when I wished for better
And I didn't want the train to come

You think you're loving but you don't love me
I want to be free, baby you've hurt me
You don't love me, I want to be free
Baby you've hurt me"

So now you want the whole world to notice that you've come around,
Now you expect,
We'll see how you're really so much better now,
But I know the truth, I won't waste my youth

On a cad and a bounder, a dog and a cheat
All the lives that you've had, all the hearts you eat
You're a rascal and a rogue, a villain and a crook
Still I tug at your line, I'm a fish on your hook
I should be better, but I'm worse...

What's the point pretending that you could be a better man (oohhooh)
Just give in, since you always end up right back where you began (ohhooh)
Still I know the truth, but I have a sweet tooth...

For a cad and a bounder, a dog and a cheat
All the lives that you've had, all the hearts you eat
You're a rascal and a rogue, a villain and a crook
Still I tug at your line, I'm a fish on your hook
You're rash and you're hasty
You're reckless with my heart, still I wait by the phone
I will never get smart
I should be better, but I'm worse...

<lj-embed id=""6""/>

<small>
Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Just you baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it everytime I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough cause you're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting away
And though I'm trying my hardest you back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
And we'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you"

Please don't say we're done
When I'm not finished
I could give you so much more
Make you feel, like never before
Welcome, they said welcome to the floor

It's been a while
And you've found someone better
But I've been waiting too long to give this up
The more I see, I understand
But sometimes, I still need you

Sometimes, I still need you

I was struggling to get in
Left waiting outside your door
I was sure
You'd give me more

No need to come to me
When I can make it all the way to you
You made it clear
You weren't near
Near enough for me

Heart skipped a beat
And when I caught it you were out of reach
But I'm sure, I'm sure
You've heard it before"

<i>fri the 8th </i>
we were supposed to go to the beach.
but bobby got his car too late
so we just went around
we went to some park up in the hills for awhile
then we went to target
then to porter ranch
then i had to go to work
bobby came by my work around 8:30
and then we were gonna see a movie but he was sleepy
so we just drove around and went back up to the park and talked
then oscar calls me @ 1 in the morning 
i had to sneak him and his friend in my room
they only stayed for like a half hour tho
they were all drunk and knocked out

and just walked around
it was pretty chill
we were there for awhile
then we got back to the valley and got shit from our houses to go to the beach
we got there around 4?
and we were just posted there for awhile
i kinda went in the water
only like up to my knee tho
then we all went home and took a shower

@ 8:30 bobby picked me back up
and then we got nigga baby and riley
and we went to see pineapple express
<b>omgosh</b>
the worst trying to get in tho
me and nigga baby were the ones who bought the tickets
then when we got up, we threw our stubs down,
and the fucking security asked to see our tickets
lmao
so we went back down
while the guys got to go in
we ended up getting in tho;
we had riley put the ticket stubs in a cup and threw it down to us (on my head)
hahahaha
then we watched the movie
it was funny
then went home

<b>long day</b>

<img src=http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y226/YUMpeRveRt/SDC10423.jpg>

then after graduations oscar, lovely, riley, chris amd I went out.
we basically just drove around.
sarah thought she was faded LMFAO
yelling out <b>""40 CRIPS ROLLING!!!!!""</b>
:/ oh hellz
then oscars car broke down
lmao.
<img src=http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y226/YUMpeRveRt/SDC10477.jpg>
we had gramps come put some anti freeze in it
it wasnt all fixed but it got oscar home.


...then...
June 29 (dat after edc EH)
<b>MY SHOW!</b>
sarah and robert went;
and riley and oscar showed up and got to see 3 of my dances
i was in 10 numbers
i think it went well
messed up cuz my nerves got tume, ppl watching me, blehh

<img src=http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y226/YUMpeRveRt/SDC10479.jpg>
<img src=http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y226/YUMpeRveRt/SDC10500.jpg>

then i split a hash brownie with oscar 
it was soo DANK!
hahhaha


...then...
me and robert had adventures
the first week he had summer schools he would come and pick me up @ 10ish
and oh man
there was this one day
1st we got a ticket
[speeding on the freeway duh]hahah
then we crashed
and broke his baby kia
[baby kia My ant!-DruG]
all cuz of LOVELY
<i>its mah parDeee; sweet 18!</i>
loved that day 
funday sunday! but it was tuesday?

...thenn...

well recently stoop came to cali
july 7th?
ew i should know, we picked him up from the airport.
yeah it was crazy
he finally found out bout oscar cuz roman told him
which i didnt mind at all
its just that, i wasnt ready to say i was with some1
yee, i basically got soo much shit from stoop
told me he hates me im dead to him;
but like this foo cheated on me
i was pissed cuz he gave me soo much shit when he was doing the same shit too
<i>like HELLO!</i>

oh and oscar broke up with me while stoop was here
it was hard
cuz i love oscar but he said he was fucking up on me...
and wow. tell me why when he asked me out he gave me a big hug and said
""plz dont hurt me erica""
and when he told me that my heart melted;
cuz i knew i could hurt him cuz i could always go back to stoop anytime
but i didnt want to hurt him
hes the one who ended up hurting me.
but we are still close, <i>very close</i>
he says he love me, just doesnt want a gf right now and still wants me in his life 
i think cuz its summer, but i said naww....
basically he doesnt wanna feel guilty when he cheats [i say]
well any way...

back to stoop
soo much fighting
he fucking had some nasty ass shit on his phone
he stayed at my house and was talking to some bitch on the phone
who texted him saying how good his dick would feel in her
and this fool was trying to get with me
like i dont know
i thought i was gonna marry this kid
<b>but fuck</b>
like he said 'love only goes so far'
idk anymore. hes like super into me more than ever
and i aint really into him
maybe right now isnt the time for us
but who knows?

<img src=http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y226/YUMpeRveRt/SDC10556.jpg>
<img src=http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y226/YUMpeRveRt/SDC10573.jpg>

what if i now think oscar could be <i>the ONE</i>
maybe im just to young to even be thinking bout that kinda stuff
i have my whole life ahead of me
but then again, what if i never find any1?
and i fuck up everything
ughhh

it SUCKS!

3. i went to court

"event","<small>things suck;
right bout now!!


so i AM talking to some guy,
and like everything has been going soooo good
until recently
it sucks man, cuz i really like him......
i mean im only his <i>wifey</i>


sometimes i feel like ima be one of those old ladies with 80 cats
=/


oh and it my mom seems to ruin <b>EVERYTHING</b> when it comes to me talking to somebody
i swear to god.
this really really really really sucks;
like no joke.
shes not even the biggest part of my life
and i know she wishes she was;
but i like how our relationship is already
cuz when she wants to get close to ppl that are close to me she ruins shit.

and the funny thing is i havent talked to mom in awhile;
& i dont remember metioning this guy to her
and i guess my brother talked to this guy (since its his friend) and he told him that my mom wants to meet him.
and it like freaked him out

UGHHHHH!

damn and i all have a project to do;
and i havent done <i>SHIT!</i>

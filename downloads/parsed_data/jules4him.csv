I really feel the last battle of headaches was sinus related, but my primary doctor said my sinus' were clear it it looked like migraines. I don't believe that, I still think it was my sinus', but the best part is that they are gone. I am feeling like myself again and that is awesome.</p>"

I just don't have anyone I can talk to, so I am writing, to write to a wall. Life is tough right now. I love my job, minus the sometimes cranky people I have to work with. The babies and toddlers, and young adults I work with are awesome. I can't decide if it is the babies or the toddlers I enjoy better. The teens are pretty boring, unless you get the talkative ones, I think those are the most nervous ones myself. 

When I am at home, it is tough. to hard to explain... family, I want to have one of my own one day, I just don't know how I am going to do it.

I am taking two summer school classes inorder to raise my GPA to go back to Olivet. I want to go back, and I don't. I miss the simpleness of the situations. All of my problems seemed so distant at school. But, because my GPA isn't going to be good enough, I am not going to be able to go back. I am ok with it when I am thinking about myself, but when I think about my roommate and all of the possible friends I might make, it makes me really sad. It makes me wish I was smarter. I know I am smart, I am just not good enough. I wish I was good enough."

I feel a little better. I bought some work clothes today. They are so cute. If I can get instructions (cough, Don, cough) I will take pictures of them and then show everyone. 

Sadly my family is continueing to fall apart. I don't want to explain because it is embarrassing to talk about but it is sad. I think it has been falling apart even before it started 20 some years ago, but now that I am paying attention, the reckage is more visable. I don't think it will ever crumble, because of many reasons I would rather not get into, but it is sad to watch my family go through it all."

I love spending time. 

Time with my mom- The past couple of days she has been really silly. That is the only way I can explain it. Instead of getting mad when she knocked a whole glass of milk of the table, and down the wall, she laughed it off. Her initial reaction was a little less than funny but after it was all cleaned up, she was laughing about it, hysterically laughing.

Then there is Kari- She is the only person that I love recalling memories of us being completely stupid together. Sure memories are fun, but every time I recall with her we laugh so hard I hurt afterward.

And we can't forget my dad- he and I don't have much in common, but the things we do, we really enjoy together. Like baseball, I don't care what game we go to, I love them because I am with him.

This feels good, using my voice. Not literally, but when I write. I will never forget my English prof. she said we don't write to say something, we write because we have something to say. I didn't really think about that until i started my persuasive speech and I thought about what I had to say. I wanted to use my voice and convince my class (that if they ever have kids) to never put them in day care. Lets not get into that right now, but I just like writing.

I started my new job on tuesday. I am a medical assistant. It is step down from my training (CNA) but they don't have any use for those skills so I take what I can. I love my job. I am still learning the ropes. I think that will take a while but it is really fun. In two days i have seen patients as young as a week old to as old as 15. There is a wide variety when you are talking peds. 

I am not sure what is going to happen in the next four months. First semester of college was real tough so it brought my GPA down so I am having lots of issues. I don't feel like writing out the list of problems so I am going to skip that part. 

Now that I have tired my self out, i am going to go to bed. I don't have to work tomorrow but I have lots to do and the day is not long enough, so I am going to go to bed so I have a few hours to sleep."

I will tell you, I can't sleep. I keep thinking about Cambodia-if that is even how you spell it. One of my profs is going there to teach and we had a going away party for her today. It was awesome to hear about what she is about to embark on, but it makes me realize what a wimp I am. Hearing about all the preperation she is having to go through and not knowing really what to expect, would be kind of scary, and that is what she is doing. Wow. She is doing this all for Christ which is wonderful. That excites me.

All of my friends are here at school and all going home as well for break. I hope I am able to bring them home with me some weekend.

"event","Being Depressed, I just want to sleep. I don't want to go to any of the rest of my classes today. I just want to crawl into bed and not wake up. I know that this is all part of Gods plan and He said he will never give me more than I can handle but I think He needs to reevaluate what I can handle because He is breaking me and I CAN'T handle it. 

By the way, I am going to my classes today even though I don't want to. 

And, I studied all day yesterday (except for three hours because I needed a well deserved break) and got some help yesterday but I need more help, no one to help me and no time to get help. (my roommate offers to help me all the time but when she does I feel it is a waste of time for both of us because it doesn't really help.

I have to go cover my dy, pink face before class."

This is so aweful. I went to anatomy today where my teacher rushede through about three days full of lecture in one 50 minute period and we have a test on Friday. If I don't pass this test with flying colors I will not pass the class and I basically lose money because this school is so frickin expensive.I know that if I wasn't supposed to be a nurse, God wouldn't have put that desire in my heart but he should have put the brains in my head first. I am sorry mom and dad."

"event","I don't know if I can do it. I want to do it so badly but I don't know if I can. School is so hard. I am depressed most of the time and I don't know what to do. I study my butt off and nothing happens. I have test after test that I normally fail and I don't know what to do. I know nursing is my calling and I don't know what to do. I am struggling so badly and I feel all alone. I know God is here with His arms out saying it is ok and all I need to do is depend on Him but I don't know how. For the first time with Him, I don't know how. I am so tired.

Everyone keeps telling me how proud of me they are and I just want to cry. I am not as successful as they think. It makes me feel like even more of a failure because I am not living up to the expectations that everyone thinks I can."

"event","Someone told me to not always write depressing things in here because it makes my life sound bad but right now I am having a hard time and I need to get it off my chest. School is really hard. It is starting to make me miserible. It is so bad that I can't even spell the word right. Anyhow, I am struggling in everything that I do and it is making it hard to go on. Everyday I want to give up. I hear the voice of God telling me that I can't but sometimes I just think it would be easier. I don't want to give up though, because I would be letting down all the people who believe in me. I haven't slept well in two days and that may not sound bad but when you are a college student who has studied the ENTIRE weekend for a huge exam, sleep is very important. I spent some time crying today. It made me tired so I slept for about two hours. I know that probably didn't help the fact that I am unable to sleep right now. My roommate is a blessing from God. I was studying the whole weekend and I am having a hard time absorbing the information so she said she would help me study, even though she had things she needed to do herself. And when I was crying tonight, she came over to me and told me that I would pass the class and that everything would be ok and practicly forced me to go to dinner with her. I probably won't sleep for a few more hours but I am going to try."

"event","What a day. Actually it started more than 24 hours ago. Midnight rolls around (11-4-04) and I haven't seen my roommate for over 2 hours. I had a vague idea where she would be but I wasn't for sure because she just got up and left. So anyhow, I found her on the first floor in her friends room, they had talked for about three hours. That is a long time for her. She is the type to be in bed by 11 and be sleeping shortly after so this whole thing was weird. Continuing on though, we both got up here and realised we had things we needed to get finished for class the next day. So, we sat down and got to work. Three hours and 45 minutes later, I am climbing into bed. I had so much energy, but I knew I needed my sleep. My roommate stayed up until 4am. That is the latest she had ever stayed up in her entire life. I crawled out of bed this morning after only three hours of sleep to go to my only class of the day. (This is Homecoming Weekend by the way) Chapel was at 11 so I decided to take a nap after Anatomy and Physiology. That was much needed! So after chapel, I edited this paper again, turned it in and went to bed at 4. Around 630, I woke up, just as the phone was ringing. I picked it up, thinking it was one of my friends from downstairs. Lo and behold, it was a guy. The funny thing is, I don't know who he was. He seemed to know me very well and wanted to get together tonight, sit at the coffee shop and talk. So, my roommate talked me into going to the coffee shop and I went. The funniest thing about this whole situation, was when he asked me to meet him, he didn't give me a time. So anyway, I took my roommate with me to the coffee shop (she sat on the other side of the room) and I read a book for about a half hour, hoping I would get lucky and this mystery man would show up. He didn't. I am so baffled about the whole situation, I didn't know what to do. So, until I find out who this mystery man is, I will be as confused as you all. Well, I am going to go to bed now, I am still so tired but I had to write this dowm so it would make some sense now, instead of no sense tomorrow morning."

When I put my cup on my tray, I accidently knocked it over and it spilled on my friends tray! It was great! It all happened so fast I couldn't stop it from tipping but it was definately luck that it didn't spill all over the table and floor! I was so awwed by the situation I had to laugh. Melissa however, told me if I had gotten it on her jacket, I would be dead meat. Thank goodness for good luck!"

"event","I learned something new today! When your nose tells you something, listen! Ok, so today in english we were editing each others papers and I didn't finish so I took it with me. The girl's paper that I was editing needed her paper back today so I had to return it. We will skip all of the boring details...I eventually find the name of the dorm she is in and I ask my R.A. where it is located. Well, since I am directionally challenged or just a ding dong, I ended up going to the wrong dorm. Now I didn't just go to the wrong dorm, noooo, I had to be a big dork and go into a guys dorm. Girls aren't allowed in guys dorms so I don't know what the guy was thinking when he let me in, nor did I know what I was thinking when I went in there. Anyway, as I am walking up to the third floor, I notice the aroma of stinky and clean guys. I of couse ignored my nose and continued up the stairs, determined to tell the girl that the dorm smelled funny. Well, on with my story, I get up to the third floor to find a guy up there and the only thought that comes in my mind is maybe this is a co-ed dorm, but how could that be, only upperclassmen are allowed to have co-ed dorms. Well, again, I ignored my conscience. So I walked down the hall way, semi-peeking my head in open doors, finding that the ""girls"" up here are pigs. Again, little did I know that I was in a male dorm. All of the sudden, I come across a guy that notices me and wispers to his roommate that there is a girl in the hallway (you are supposed to yell ""Girl in the hall"" when ever you are in a guys dorm if you are not supposed to be there, ie. open dorms night and vis versa). So then I hear him saying it over and over again, I assume that he was going door to door or was just so wowwed that a girl was up there. Anyway, as he is saying this, i find myself walking faster and faster to get out of that dorm. I was so nervous. I don't know how I get myself in these situations. I laughed the whole way to the right dorm where I had to get a hold of myself before someone noticed and wanted to hear the story. I am sure now that I will always check to see that I know where I am going before I go there. That was my funny dtory of the day! Now you can all laugh at me next time you see me."

"event","Hey I thought I wrote bout my nickname and shit like that but guess I didn't so I will tell you the amzing story of how  East Coast originated  . . .  . 
   I was talkin with this girl Katie and like back in December I gave her this ""hippie"" nickname skippy, i knowwww righttt HOt! lol Then laters she we were tryin to find me one too since I can't use my old one (you all know what that is, with the theme song) 
So she decided to call me pookie and I was well, hmmmmm I didn't really like it cuz it's like a fuckin pet name and then she call me a Homophobic and I was all like no the fuck im not and shes all like why don't you and  whatever n shit like that 
but then she changed it to  butters  and that was ooook but eh 
it lack a certain thing 
  So then one day in Mr. Clean's class we were talking bout where we were from shit and Katie said she was born in California and I was from NY and and if you smart you know that Cali is west  and NY is east and she came up with callin me East Coast!! and I call her West Coast and we have are little signs that we use that are just fuckin awesome !! 
bUT . . . Then in my comp class me and Casserole (yep that's ur name) were writing to eachother on Gaggle and weeelll  I found this totally awesome bitchin drees that was you guessed it green!!! So I decied to send it to everyone in the whole fckin room !! 
I signed it East Coast ~ Holla ~ !! and this one girl opened up and was like who the hell is this and then she read it and stated yellin holla and shit and now it like East Coast hollaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
ok well if you read this entire thing and didn't get a thing out of it well then

 In like what september I sent my good and reliable friend carol like 10 bucks and maybe she thought it was for her B-day or w/e but i think i said it was to send the yearbook and she never did. despite that I'd think that you would have sent it as soon as it came you know. I mean Im turning into a bitch about this cuz i really want it and now i feel like i have to fuckin badger everyone just to fuckin get it! Just send me me my fuckin year book i don't know how fuckin busy everyone is but no matter how busy i am i always make time for my friends especially when they ask me for somethin specifically. Maybe I should have sent it to Sas it seems she the only one who I can count on. I may be mad right now but what im sayin is true.
well tomorrow  i will probably regret writing this if it hurt any ones feelings  
even if it doesn't sorry ok but there is one thing I won't regret and that's having Sapphire for a friend.

#1 
    cuz i feel like every friken ting I do for people is so unapreciated by people i feel like I'm givin 110% on friekn everything and someone else that dopes maybe 50% gets the same praise.
# 2 JADE
 Every fuckin morning I wake my fuckin so called sister jade up from her fuckin precious drooling slumber like fuckin 10 times and when she does she bites my head off cuz shes cranky!!!!!!!  well ya know what fuck you!! Take what I do into consideration!!!! JUST ONCE CARE ABOUT SOEMONE ELSES FEELING BESIDES YOUR OWN!!! , she doesn't even know how to set the alarm! she is just really really starting to bug me with her attitude , like she's rather put down soemone else or argues forever about soemhitng  before she would ever admit that she is fukcin wrong im serious she really won't she will make up all the excuses in the world down to like the ice cream mans truck make had a bad song playin so it distracted her decison or soem shit like that
she is so afraid to show any  good emotion toward family that she repeatedly puts everything down just so shes comfortable 
in her friken english class she made a book that got to be published and thats pretty cool so you would want to write bout somthing important that you could keep forever and she could write bout anyhting thing she chose 6 of her friends there is nothing wrong with that but she doesn't really even know half of them! Like she will be friends with any of them in the future anyway ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh that just bugs the shit outta me
some people need to take other people's feeing into consideration 
i also am a good friend, hell , im the best fuckin friend anyone could ever ask for you need me I'm there in a fuckin heartbeat! I will always be there for people who need me 
# 3 My fuckin friends never are on when i am so i have no one to bitch my feelings too
which really sucks, you can always bitch your feeling to me , just e-mail me if ya want i'll always reply i don't mind the bitchiness you can count on that.

     i know im not being selfish, im not a selfish person at all. i always do my best to make sure everyone is good before me and i just feel right now no one notices or cares. I think what if i just stopped helping or doing anything , then maybe they would notice but then i stop myself and I remember what i once hear that no matter what size the job always do your best whether your the president of a country or you work at Burger King  im gonna do my best no matter who notices cuz that's just who I am

    No, I didn't die from this place, but it really is starting to get to me I really don't like it here but i won't complain cause life and God are good to me. Next year I am going to be senior i was always scared that, that day would come but now Im more excited because I don't know whats gonna happen after but thats the fun part. I can do anything I want, be anything that's what i feel. I'm goin going to Cali or NYC maybe with a couple of friends after I graduate and I'm gonna make something of myself.(yeah I did say that)
People always assume that I've had a million boyfriends but that's not true I haven't really found anyone that I really liked enough to put myself out there. Sometimes i think it's me but i know I'll find the right person. I think maybe I'm scared that maybe I'm missing someone else, someone better but, I know it will happen, someday."

Well, I just have to say something to everyone who thinks that they have boring shit fuck life. Your life is what u make it as simple as i put it. Honesty, you could luv ur life no matter how rich or poor (but i would like to be rich, who wouldn't) but thats not the point. the point is who hasn't thought their life was a lttle boring at times, I know I have. A lot of pople just want to grow up and get their childhood over with so they can do what hey want or they are tired of waititng for that day to come good or bad. I think you should just at least try to tell yourself  that ur gonna live the life u want whhther u feel like the worlds on ur side or not make the world on ur side. If y ou feel like you've had a bad day just tell yourself therte a new day tomorrow and u can make it better the next day or the day after. People say life is short but i hate it when they minimize life to being that way. i think Life isn't short it's just that it people make it seem that way because as you live your  so- called looong booring life you can't actually see all the things that are happening around you until one day it seems so short. I think you should just do the things you wanna do. Whenever you feel like there is no one else, no one that you can talk to, talk to God. I know if your not a believer you  think it sounds crazy but just do it cause it may make you feel better. God is always open to anyone willing to let him in and let me tell you life isn't as dark and scary if you just believe, in something. Growing up to me as i am 16, i feel like I don't know wut the hell is going on, i don't know where my life is going but i just want to get there. It's like you find youself in a fog and only you can guide yourself out. I believe anyone can be anything they want to be in life , you have a choice whether you take the right or wrong path it's your choice. I know the right path isn't always the easy one but im sure it'll pay off in the future. 
Well i have done enough jibber jabbering about life n shit haven't I? lol Well i don't even know wut i wrote or if i went over the same thing and if i spelled anything correct but i do you wut im talkin about.
Or do I? lol jk

"event","I have heard that the only thing that u should fear is fear itself. I've also learned from perspective that,that is the one true thing that everyone fears and that is what some people let rule their lives. But I have decided  That i will not let fear consume my life  anymore. I try (I'm only human) to live by the moment  and do things that i won't regret not doing. I will not be afraid of death I will be afraid of the un lived life (yes, i know Tuck Everlasting, loved that movie by the way) But anyway I am totally being serious about this and i know that is soo unlike me to be taken seriously
but for this one brief entry i have to let u know that i have grown so much not accademically  but in life and the way i feel and think about things.
My life will always be changing but for the better . When I look back at this I will realize this was the day I was freed , freed by all the stupid things that u can get caught up in , in life. I have woke up from my slumber to face my true reality."

Why don't they like me?
I have not done a thing to them
I can feel them
They look at me
I think I can here their bitter thoughts about me
They get louder everyday
Louder and louder
I hear whispers of unacceptance 
unwilliness
unlike towards me
I think Im going crazy 
why? Why won't they give me a chance
they don't know me
but  they don't care 
they form a shield so i can't get in
louder
the whispers get
the more i go crazy . . .

Was it in my head all along?

I can understand if people don't agree with Bush because they have they're own opinion , they're wrong (hehe) but it's their own opinion. It is just beyond me why they would dis their own country  i mean they think americans are stupid when they are the kind of people who cause  people like them to feel that way ,they are the people that give Americans a bad name . Now that Is just plain uneducated and ingnorant. They say they would like to live in another country well, get the fuck out! See how ya like on the other end of the spectrum. I mean you can complain about something when ur on top . Like rich people say  you don't need money to be happy  ask a poor person that  lol ya know what im sayin. why don't they live in another counrty they'll be crawlin back i assure you. That's whats so great about this country you have the right so say those things. It makes me sad to think that some ignorant people don't appreciate what they really have."

I mean, what if i had my cousin over and invited all of them except i wanted to keep it small and didn't invite two of them over. That would be fine if the six of us weren't that close but we always do those things together and for them to just leave me out felt like if I had balls and someone smashed them up with a hammer.

Maybe i shouldn't have wrote that e-mail to Meredith i jst needed to get it all out. I should have wrote in here instead but whatever. At lunch i heard them talking about throwing Mana a suprise party. I figured they didn't invite me! Then after school at drama club im so sick of it i wanted to join i really did but now im just in it for anna cause she wants we to stay after with her. I mean if we are such good friends why wouldn't she tell me about the party? I wouldn't have gotten half as mad as i did when Carol came up with the excuse that they didn't want to many people! Im sorry but, that is just some plain ass bull SHIT! So Hana,carol,Mer,and Anna are going and they can't invite me maybe they have something against me i don't know. I do talk to Mona but it's not like shes a converstasion piece or somethin! I know i talk to her just as much as Anna or maybe more in fact i have never seen her talk to her but what the fuck ever.
In Drama today i knew after i asked anna about the party that they didn't ask me to come and then she tried to turn it around on me by asking if i really ever talked to her anyway. Like she did? she knew i was mad i could sense it. She acted like i was dumb when she asked me what the fuck a synonym for skill is and I said i didn't know.Well maybe she thoguht i was snaping , i was so mad i honestly couldn't tell. How the hell should i know ur the fuckin robot!  When i said i didn't know she said do you even know what a synonym is? Im LIKE OK YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT! I had to leave before i could lash out at her! Well anyway that was good to get out. I just wish my friends would be more honest with me.  Sometimes I dont feel like they are my friends at all. I tryed to call Sas later to get it all out but she wasn't home. Anyway got to go  I feel a lot better. So hows ha ha ha ha ha ha ha my ass"

I'm not really as depressed as my title I just have a  sarcastic sense of humor. I love life and everything that comes with it the good and bad. I know it seems like I'm on crack or I took to many pain killers, maybe its just female hormones, those they're such a bitch. I wish I could keep feeling like this and never forget the value of life and why God put us all here but I'm only human. Whenever I feel like shit I will just think of the long road ahead.

She's emotionally distraught because of a break up she had. It's hard to talk to her because I want her to be happy and not to think about it. She cared for him so much, she would have given up anything for him. 
  Now I want to kick his ass, I know that won't help but it will make me feel better. She  calls him all the names in the book then says she still wants to be friends.

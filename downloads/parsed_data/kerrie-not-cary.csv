(they had/have the puke flu.) therefore, i had to escape my house & run to catherine's. (actually i drove.) we played sims2 with john the rest of the night, creating deranged families with fat teenagers, buhlimic bitches, and cute emo boys.

i'll be in nyc until new year's as of tomorrow, so call me on my cellphone and maybe we can have really long conversations about nothing. picture post when i get back, slut bags.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>and in case you didn't already hear, i'm marrying brian flowers."

"event","Chorus makes me want to put a shotgun in my mouth and pull the trigger. Lately, I've found myself pretending to like people I despise, and I despise myself for it. Especially when those people are egotistical pathological liars, cynical hypocrites, and/or artificial bimbos. Doesn't it bother you when somebody is so utterly transparent you can see right through everything they say or do? Almost all the people in my life right now I find myself unable to talk to--to really talk to--without worrying they're judging me or will repeat every word I say to someone else. I feel like every time I leave a room I'm being criticized; I guess what comes around goes around. I hate that feeling of not knowing what you're feeling. I have no idea what's missing in my life, let alone how to fix it.

conference was fun. we met alot of armonk/tuckahoe people (ie: victor who is amazing ""yeah conference 04!"" and louie who is absolutely gorgeous). we also met some incredibly crazy christian's such as annie and stew. monday i forget what happened. tuesday i frantically tried to complete 25 research paper note cards in two periods and succeeded. then we went to the men's shelter and served them a holiday dinner-type-thing and saw nana (my favorite person in the world) who'd knitted us quite lovely winter hats (mine has balls on the top; catherine's has a mudflap). we got rather bored at one point and decided to talk about our futures, deciding that catherine would be a mountain-woman with either a shaved head or hair down to her feet, and will make homemade jerky out of the squirrels she hunts in the backyard of her rustic log cabin. laura will be a very successful doctor living in a suburb near boston and married to a lawyer that is never home, and has one child (a girl named mary) who is obviously raised by an aupair who cannot make proper lunches nor take her to the mall when she wants to. sophia will be a world-travelling feminist with a kabillion adopted children that she drives around in her black saab. i will apparently be an upscale journalist living in a penthouse in nyc with my 7 kids and rich old husband, and according to catherine i will wear sunglasses on my head everyday to hold back my bangs. i will also have 16 male mistresses imported from brazil. we'll all go to catherine's for the holidays; she'll make us jerky, laura'll bring the champagne (as well as a backpack full of pills and antibacterial lotion for her daughter), i will bring the assorted cheeses and freebies from work, and sophia'll bring the gifts. while me and laura sit next to the fire, catherine will teach our children to hunt wild raccoons and moose(s) in her yard with homemade spears and bows&arrows. the future looks bright.

"event","School today resembled a massive dark cloud waiting to burst into a horrible storm. Her friends had nothing to say, her friends' friends didn't know what to say, the teachers could barely speak. Every hallway was filled with people crying or about to cry. The fact that we'll <i>never</i> see her again, that we'll <i>never</i> be able to tell her she's beautiful, that we'll <i>never</i> be able to tell her how much she's loved... really hurts. Tomorrow I'm going to the service for her; hopefully it will bring some sort of closure, although right now that seems inconceivable.

I hope the holidays will bring at least a little bit of happiness to Tina's friends and family. Or maybe it will just make things worse. At a time like this everything is confusing; there are so many questions left unanswered, so many doors left unshut. I tried to move more things into my new room today & do as much Christmas shopping as I could online just to take my mind off of things. It didn't help. Everything just seems so inconsequential right now."

I feel so weird lately. Like things are happening but not really <i>happening</i>. There's not much of a difference between happiness and sadness. I told Sophia today that after school ends, I can't remember what happened. Is that weird? I talked to Kevin last night. I finally told him that I felt that I couldn't trust him and that I couldn't talk to him because I knew he didn't care. I think that really hurt him and I'm glad. I think I'm going to stop talking about him to other people, though. It just makes me get this tight feeling in my throat and my eyes start to burn. I'd rather be numb to it all then actually feel. He goes back to Florida tomorrow. The bonfire tomorrow should be fun. Is anyone actually going to the dance? My mom's not home the entire weekend which means I can basically do whatever.

"event","school was weird. nothing happened. at all. don told me it was his last day working at my physical therapy place today. i almost cried. he's one of the coolest people i've ever met, and i've only known him two weeks. now i'm with the greasy guido-italian from westlake. i decided i'm going to go tuesday afternoons though; that's when the broken-shouldered guy goes. his name is richard, he is very tan& he wore a led zeppelin tshirt today. hard yet?

voice lesson went well, kind of killed my throat though. afterwards i had that sexy demi moore voice. he made me do scales starting at the c above high c. i've been drinking 4381902 mugs of tea daily. i still haven't decided on what song i want to do for nyssma. i found out i got into area all-state chorus though (!), so that made my day alot better. doc told me that on the town, or whatever its called, isn't all that bad, good songs. sounds fucktarded though, so i guess the wiz is still my choice.

momo if i come in tomorrow and our hallway isn't decorated, i'm beating your ass down to the ground with my crutch. yeah, kind of like today X 8437189

i realized today that i still haven't gotten miranda/karla's birthday presents. miranda's birthday was a few days after i broke my knee, karla's was the day before my surgery. so i guess i have a good enough excuse.

kevin's getting out of rehab tomorrow i think. that's bad though, because then he's back in the so-called ""program"" in florida, where he relapsed about two weeks ago. my mom's really stressing out. it's weird though, because for the first time i'm not. once it soaks in a bit, i'll probably get all messed up about it again. but there's seriously nothing else i can do. i've written him as many letters & poems, cried to him too many times, cried about him too many times... right now i'm just too worn out from his bullshit to <s>care</s> think about it.

and i'm not so sure that's a bad thing."

"event","I've been beginning to hate myself lately. I say things and mean another. My promises always end up broken. I think too much of little things, and not enough about the important ones. At the end of the summer I loved how free I felt of all the drama that came out of my relationships: friends, guys, family. It all just felt so trivial. And now I'm back in the same position I was at the end of last year and I don't like it. Back to being caught in the middle of battles and led on by a guy I swore I'd never talk to again. Too many secrets, too many lies. It all needs to stop. But at the same time I don't want to mess anything up, hurt anyone, do something I'll regret later, or be held responsible for things out of my control.


Anyway, the light outside is beautiful so I'm off to take some photographs. Hope I don't fall down the stairs or anything."

I probably wouldn't want always be at my house either when I could be doing better things with my time. It's just I spend the whole week waiting for the weekend so I can see people... and tonight when I couldn't I just felt really bad.

We need to do that much more often. But next time, we're not talking about me ""acting buhlimic"" because I'm not. That was amusing.

I lifted my leg for the first time today at physical therapy--all by myeffingself!-- and when I burst into my house telling my dad and anyone who would listen they kind of just stared at me and then nodded their head faking enthusiasm.

I sit on the couch for a few hours doing homework, waiting for one of my freak show tutors to show up, they come, ask me how my knee is, check the work, leave. I'm starting to except this whole sitting-on-couch-for-infinity predicament. I did get up briefly and go to Cosi with Karla though, which was nice--except for the group of moms that pretend they're still 16 pushing their newborns in strollers talking vociferously at the table next to us. Way to ruin a turkey and brie sandwich, honey. Despite my mom's idea to turn hospital bracelets into the newest trend [""Instead of writing one's name in that white space, you could write ""MOODY"" or ""HOTTIE"".] I cut the green one off today. Sorry, babes.

I'm actually a little wary about going back to school, whenever that may happen, because of a certain someone who is in the middle of a certain frustrating situation with a certain somebody else. I won't say anything more about that except that it's going to be dejavu from last year. Ehgk.

I rented Mean Girls to watch tonight and I'm so effing excited. God, how I love Lindsay Lohan, even if half of her torso is amassed mainly of silicone and other surgically injected substances. It's amazing how casually we talk about plastic surgery today, really. Mothers buying a new pair of boobs for their daughters for a graduation present, fathers paying for their nose jobs because they feel self concious. Ten years ago if someone had told me that their chest was filled with various polymeric organic silicon compounds made of oils, greases, and plastics, I would have vomited in their faces. But today? Today they're cures for low self-esteem and a bad gene makeup. Bizarre.

Enough of my ranting on the corrupt social morals of our world. I'm going to go watch my god damn movie.

So that was me and Anand bonding. He heard I just fell over. Yes, that is what happened. But the story is still somewhat exciting. And it's always fun to exaggerate a bit.

I'm one of the lucky people who get sick from morphine, so I threw up what seems like three thousand times during my stay. Various people came to visit me, bringing balloons and flowers, but I don't really remember anything but whispering thanks and then throwing up some more. And at some point during the night I was just dry heaving because I hadn't eaten anything, thus having nothing to throw up. Gross.

These last two weeks have been the most boring of my entire life. Everyone is back in school but me so all I do is lie around all day watching reruns and QVC. The ironic thing is I really don't enjoy watching television. It makes me frustrated because they replay the same show up to five times in one day. I've read and reread every magazine I have. Organized all of my photo albums. Read some books. Those of you who get to go to school shouldn't take it for granted. I could go on and on about how sorry I feel for myself, but I won't. 

Kristen's party was incredible. Being out of my house = Heaven. Sitting on the couch for two straight hours with Chris Mo Sophia Laura Karen Ally Joelle and whoever else was there = Hilarious. Anthony's band, Christ child or us and <b>H</b>im = Unneccessarily loud, but good. Stealing the microphone with Sophia and rocking out with some Ashlee Simpson = Feckin' great. I can't wait until I get those pictures back, especially the one of Mo with my crutch. Saucy.

When I first broke my knee, all anyone would say to me was ""Everything happens for a reason."" I was getting pretty fucking sick of hearing that. But the reasons are beginning to show. I realized how much I'm loved, something I've needed to realize for a while. I have an amazing group of friends and a family that cares about me so much; I used to take that for granted. Cards, flowers, balloons, stuffed animals, food, and presents have been coming daily and for that I am truly thankful to everybody. I sound like such a crippled corn-ball--like in one of those ""REALLIFE!"" articles you read in magazines--but it's so true. I love you all."

Today when my mom and I were on our way to Plaza Video, she stopped at the gas station to fill up, and the guy that was filling our tank asked me what had happened and when I told him he reassured me that things would be alright, that I'd get through this. I mean, it's this random guy that I'd never met, a complete stranger, and there he was... just being so nice and sympathetic, and I just broke down. Even people I haven't talked to since school ended, or maybe longer, have been IMing me or calling me and saying they heard about my knee and they're so sorry. It makes me feel so guilty, because when this first happened, everyone I saw or talked to... I just wished that they could be going through this with me, not just hearing about it... but actually experiencing it, and for that I feel selfish and self-centered, and the guilt just piles up.

And it's even worse when people I love say things. My mom, my sisters, my cousins, my friends... telling me that there's a reason for everything, looking on the bright side, just smiling and helping me in any way they can. It makes me feel so lucky to have this kind of support... so lucky it makes me cry.

"event","Hmm, let's see what did Kerrie do today?
Oh. Right. Fractured her knee.


Yeah. So I went to practice this morning: ran, did drills. And, as we were warming up the goalie, me and Laura started horsing around and singing Disney songs. Well, I went down to do a rockstar pose (lounged forward and used my stick as a microphone), when all of a sudden I feel my kneecap pop out of my leg, snap, and pop back in, all in the course of two seconds. So I hear it slide against another bone/muscle and crack and collapse in pain. It took a few seconds for the team to realize I wasn't faking it... that I was crying hysterically and couldn't get up, and then they all stampeded over, as others got ice, and Brielle started stroking my head. It all happened to fast and right now I just can't absorb it, even though it's been almost exactly 12 hours since <lj-cut text=""it happened."">

After a half hour of lying in the middle of the field unable to move, my sister came to pick me up... the coach & Brielle carried me to her car and slid me in. I couldn't stop crying and choking on my spit and tears. We drove over to the hospital, in which I had to wheel myself around on a wheelchair... I have a newfound respect for crippled people, I honestly never knew how horrible it is to be so humiliated and looked down upon with eyes filled with utmost pity, as you try to find a ramp or a door big enough to accomadate your vehicle. Terrible. 

So I went inside, got X-rayed, then saw some psycho, nut-job doctor who asked me if I could straighten my leg (it's still stuck in this half bent position from when I fell), and when I replied, ""No."", he preceded to move my leg horizontal to my hips as I screamed and told him to stop. And then he just ""hmphed"" and looked at the X-rays, sighing every few minutes, only to inform me that I had broken off a piece of my kneecap (a fracture, apparently) and that it was something he'd ""never seen before in the history of his employance"" (not the greatest thing to tell an emotionally-unstable, worried fuck whose suffering from excrutiating pain), and that if it healed over the weekend I'd be able to play in a few weeks, but if not I have to get surgery sometime next week and am out the entire season... which fucking completely sucks because my coach just told me that I'm the starting center forward, and had a good chance of becoming captain. And after all I put up with last year with the upperclassmen... it just seems so worthless now. <lj-cut>

To top not playing this season off, the trip I've been looking forward to all summer, Cape Cod with Laura, Cath, Sophia, Christina, Kat, and Karen... I now cannot go on. Oh, but my doctor said I could go, that it wouldn't affect the healing process, and Mrs. Meberg said she's fine with me going... but then Christina's mom had to be all ""nurse-like"" and tell me I can't go. Is it really her place to decide if I can see my friends whom I haven't seen all summer because I've been working? Or if yet another memory can be had without me while I sit on my crippled ass at home, the same home I've been at all summer?

I hate not being able to walk anywhere. To simply get up and answer the phone. Or get myself a drink. Or walk up a flight of stairs. Or get dressed. Or take a shower. Or even go to the fucking bathroom without help.

Tell me, God, do you plan to fuck over my summer any more than you already have? Why don't you just shoot me with a lightening bolt? Or, is that too much to ask?

My eyes are burning from all the salt they've projected, and I'm sure staring at the computer screen is probably making it worse... and I have to figure out how I'm going to get out of this chair and escort myself into bed in a way that won't take a fucking month."

Blahblah hung out on the church steps (it's what the cool kids do), talked to Emily, saw Doug briefly, and uh...</lj-cut> Really did nothing until the field hockey ""bonding"" party tonight, in which hords of teen-angst-ridden freshmen sat around in my backyard eating the pounds and pounds of food that everyone brought. (I feel absolutely disgusting.) It actually sort of brought us closer: some of them became alot less shy around us, and I found out alot about hookups they've had with older guys, I won't go into depth as to allow you to not vomit all over your computer. So it was good, I guess, and tomorrow I shall practice for the last time until NEXT TUESDAY (!!!), which is amazing.

"event","Summer is going by so fast, I feel like I hardly have a chance to catch my breath and enjoy it in full. Catherine, Laura, and Sophia all return on Saturday, and Karla comes back Friday night. Has a month really already gone by? The first two weeks went so fast because of work, and then last week and this week my cousin came and stayed with me which was so much fun. We actually didn't get sick of eachother, which is a first. I hated when she left though, not only because I probably won't see her until this winter, but it means I have to start running again and getting in shape for field hockey. Camp for that starts in a week and a half and preseason shortly after. I can't believe how quickly everything seems to be happening.

The past seven days of Laura's visit was filled with city trips and laughing so hard it hurts. I saw NYU, my dream college since I was five, and looooved it.  So much. We went because my cousin is considering applying to it. It's just perfect: the location, the classes, the dorms, the people, the internships, the abroad school in Florence... everything. I was thinking alot about time though. Considering how fast this year went, I can only imagine how fast time will fly until we'll be filling out applications and saying our last goodbyes. Scary.

And now it is time to ramble on and on about my hair. Firstly, thank you all for helping me make the decision whether or not to do it, and how to. I ended up dying it ""Amber Shimmer"" and I love it. It's not too drastically light, and it has a cool look in the sun. I took alot of pictures so I'll post them, even though many of you will get the privelege to see it first person! Ahh! Not. But seriously, your advice helped, even if alot of the comments I didn't get until after it was done. I'm afraid I'm going to become a bit of an addict to dyeing it, however.

Alrighty. Time to cut this short. Karla just called to tell me about Spain, I have to download a virus destroyer to my computer, and Madeline was just diagnosed with sclerosis (her spine is really curved), therefore my mom has decided to have a family night. Ugh. Wish me luck."

i brought suzanne up, and franne, tyler, and chelsea were all up there. tyler brought his friend trevor, who actually spoke this time, and turned out to be pretty cool. and he's hot, so that's cool too.

here is my urea-filled day:
<lj-cut>me and suzanne and franne took the rowboat out to these woody islands they have in the middle of the lake: bad idea. i think i peed in my pants, seriously. i can't even describe the fun that we had. we met these two guys about our age on the island who were complete hicks and decided to steal this towel from their canoe, which was resting on a rock, so i pulled on the towel but it wouldn't come off the seat, and then i pulled harder and the entire canoe falls into the water. so suzanne starts like, screaming and we're like screw it and start rowing away but suzanne does this jackie chan leap into the canoe, then about 5 seconds later realizes she doesn't know how to row, so she starts hyperventilating because she's in this canoe of these two kids we don't even know floating away from an island with noone to help her. it was so funny me and franne were laughing and crying and peeing all at the same time. just thinking about it is making me laugh out loud. madeline is looking at me like i'm crazy, so i'm going to stop recalling that little floozy.

so we started to row back to the house, after getting in a fight with the hicks' flabby dad because we asked if they were from around there and they said yes and franne goes ""that sucks"" so the dad's like ""ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T"" and then starts making fun of how i only rowed like 20 feet within 40 minutes and i go ""well atleast we know how to use a SUBWAY"" and it was funny. man. ah, i wish i had a video camera. then we get back to the house, have about an hour of lake-fun, franne left, we got out of the water and started playing scattegories in the garden swing with tyler and trevor and it was another pee-in-your-pants episode, then we ate and just hung out and talked: very fun. me and tyler ended up getting in a fist fight because i told him i could ""take him because i lived in the 'hood"" and he ended up grabbing my leg and punching me in the stomach so i clawed him and he was like ""TRUCE!"" so we did a ghetto handshake and that was the end of it. god, i love that kid. </lj-cut>

so now i'm back, after getting lost in the boonies of new jersey with my directionless mother and my baby suzanne. 

<u><b>3 reasons why i love suzanne:</b></u>
<b>1. </b>
<b>trevor</b> ""when i'm rich, i want to have an albino as a slave.""
<b>me</b> ""my friend zach's brother is albino""
<b>suzanne</b> ""really?!""
<b>me</b> ""no. he's just really pale and has white hair.""
<b>suzanne</b> ""so wouldn't that mean he IS an albino?""
<b>2.</b>
""look! a deer is crossing the parkie! ...way.""
<b>3.</b>
she says ""hi! have a nice dayyyy!"" in this really annoying high-pitched, enthusiastic voice to everybody we passed whilst rowing."

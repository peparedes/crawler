"event","oh man did i have fun this weekend. lets start off with last year...

    Last year I was nominated to go into the Order of the Arrow. A secret orginization. First thing I had to do was past my ordeal. I get there and I went to a cerimony. There were guys dressed like indians (hence ""Order of the Arrow"") and they told anyone who wanted to go back. Now was the time. Those that wanted to stay took a step forward. Then we marched a mile into the woods and slept under the stars. Of course with my luck it was raining. We get up in the morning (me and my clan) and go for our tasks for the day and food. They gave us a hardboiled egg for brekfast. Afterwards we worked hard for about 4 hours. Then lunch. I recieved half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a slice of apple. We worked for another 5 hours. And the entire time we had to take a vow of silence. Then came the fun part. Around 5 or so our clan was up for another cerimony. This one was for us to be accepted into the group. Four guys in the indian costumes had told us the password and shown us the handshake. From that point on I could not wait until it would be my turn to move up in rank.

     Thats where yesterday came into play. I went up for my Brotherhood. It was held same place as the last one. We got there and i layed my stuff in a cabin with the other candidates. We had to gaurd watch over the new ordeals (what i was last year) so i got no sleep. Then we got fed. We had french toast in the morning with sausage. Then we worked with the ordeal candidates for 4 hours. They got their pp and J at lunch, while we had meatballs, tomato soup, and pudding. We then worked for another 5 hours. This time we were allowed to talk and were expected to make sure the others didn't. Then came the second fun part. A little frightning but cool. We get up to ""the rock"" (where we hold our cerimonies) and there are 3 indians up there. Plus a fourth that guided us up there. During the cerimony I heard. ""you will suffer cheerfully as we will cut your hand and mingle blood. To signify you are a true brother."" The chief took a knife, placed the blade end in his hand and grasped hard. He then pulled it out quickly. He was bleeding. After they took the knife to our hands we did the handshake that we were taught last year and we learned a new password. Then he repeated ""you will suffer cheerfully, you will place a stick in the fire and move your hand slowly over top of it."" He placed a stick in the fire and put his hand over the fire. After that was done. We had a big feast. Oh man... greatest weekend ever lol."

What? So i asked her if she cheated on me and she said no. That relieved me. I get back and someone else was like are u still dating her? and i was like to my knowledge i am. And they said, well her profile says chris i love u or something like that... and i went REALLY?

so then i'm thinking wow... we broke up but i wasn't informed.. i was just so disappointed and sad. god life fucking sux. so me an tom went to stewarts after hanging at his house. i had a fatcat and he had a cheeseburger. god was i stuffed. THEN we go to sports and stuff and he wants me to play DDR. i said no at first but he convienced me other wise.. I got a bigass cramp so we went to air hockey and then SKKEEEEBAAALLLLL. 

i get home and their like... yea toms havin a wrestling thing.. and my dad said no to going so i went and called katherine and i was a phone whore for about 30 minutes.. I was randomly talking to ppl. The phone was constantly being passed around.

So i talk with my friends and tara begins to talk to me.. And man did she cheer me up. I do not think that ANYONE else could have done a better job. THANK U TARA! and today was a track meet against SOUTH RIVER RATS.. WE WON MUHAHAHAHA. during the meet i talked with nicole tara and diana and they made me feel a little better. i got to write down the long jump WHOO HOO.

JASMINE I LUV U AND I'M SORRY.. not that its going to do anygood. people usually don't listen when i apologize. it makes sense i am an asshole.. and then we got school. School work has been slipping alot. enough said.i am about ready to just kill myself.. i won't do it but i feel like it.

i figured out what i was worried about.. and i'm not longer worried.. i'm scared. but thats reserved to be explained to one person (tom i really need to talk to u). i love how when something really good comes around in your life... and one small mistake fucks it all up. i am injured for track meaning i suck. i'm stupid so there goes school. nothing is going my way this week. sucks to be me i guess. well i'm done for now... i might post more later after i get my confidence back up"

"event","Its been a while .. long while.. scince i've updated and alot has gone on.. good news : i'm going out with jasmine. i'm a little worried about something but i'll eventually get over it.

this has indeed been the best trip i've ever been on.... We went on a trip today.. 10 miles up to sunfish pond and back. The way up wasn't bad, but the way back was the funniest/most risky. Me an tom are going back an forth with jokes. Then the map says to cross the river. We're like, wheres the bridge. There was no bridge. So in order to get across me and tom had to climb up a really really really steep hill (and it was muddy and went straight into rocks if we fell) and get some bigass rocks to help us out. That did no good. Then the others on the other side pointed out about dead tree. Me and tom push it down and we use that to help us get to a small island in the middle. Then we all had to take our socks and shoes off and cross barefoot.. THAT WAS COLD. the second tom sunk his foot in he was like.. oh yea... hypothermia right there. So then we get to another area that didn't seem to have a path. so we had to walk along the river on a steep inclined hill. I noticed that toms mom, steves mom, my dad, and dave weren't behind us. so we're waiting. And they show up but on the other side so then they have to walk all the way around. Steve went to help them so he gave me the camcorder and i taped them getting across. After that the rest of the way was ok with the exception of a few muddy slips and slides along the way. So overall it was a fun trip.

I haven't hung out with jasmine in a while and i don't even know what to think anymore.. Well thats all i have to write for now.. CIAO."

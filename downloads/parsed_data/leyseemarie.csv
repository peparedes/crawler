"event","Well Christmas break is over, that makes me very sad.  I was having so much fun back at home, and I was kinda getting used to being there all the time, so leaving again was hard.  The 3 weeks I was home though were very interesting, and very emotionally stressing.  I'd rather not talk about it in such a publicly accessible place, but needless to say it was draining, but I managed to have some fun while I was home, that made it all worth while.  First I got to spend every day with eric, that alone made my entire break wonderful.  Some days it was even so perfect that his face was the last thing I saw before bed, and the first thing I saw in the morning :)  It was nice.  Along with spending time with my boyfriend, I got to see my boo (aka sami) and I got to spend time with amber, which was nice because with our schedules now it's almost impossible to get together so that was nice.  I really don't know what to say about the rest of the time I was home...so I'll just quickly recap that break for you.

1. Christmas, which is my favorite time of the year
2. shopping with boo and ashley janca in PA (no sales tax)
3. eating at eatin park (with amber and then the next day with boo)
4. watching crash with boo
5. sleepovers with eric
6. watching 40 year old virgin and madagascar (sorry if it's spelled wrong)
7. playing mom to all my drunk friends on new years
8. driving to my aunts house in PA for a family dinner
9. visiting vive at the high school :)
10. and finally, spending way too much money, that I now have to work like hell to make up :)"

Eric Christopher Price,
You and truly the love of my life, I don't know what I'd do without you.  I feel like a better person when I'm around you, and I know that in fact it is you that makes me the best I can be.  I don't think I could ever express how much I love you and how much I miss you.  I wish that I could spend every second of everyday with you, that would make me happiest.  You are my best friend, and I can tell you everything in confidence knowing that my secrets and deepest thoughts are safe.  I thank God for everyday that I spend with you, and I thank him for bringing us together.  I've never felt so loved in my entire life, when you said ""one mind, one soul"" it almost brought me to tears, I've never felt like this before.  We've been together for the best year of our lives, and I know we'll be together for many years to come.  In 5 days I'll be in your arms again and that's when I'll feel happiest :*
~*~Per Sempre,
Lisa Marie Ferrando"

Other than that there is no new news on the home-front...I talked to eric for like 4 hours last night, but that really shouldn't surprise anyone if it does you are way out of the loop haha.  I can't wait, 6 day until i'm home for break!!! here's what's on the agenda:

1. see eric, cuz he's picking me up on tuesday
2. see my family, cuz i miss them, and my brother hurt his leg, so i need to hug him

"event","So this weekend was a bust, all I did was study and walk around campus, and go to work.  I did, however, get paid time and 1/2 for working on Vets day!  So the rest of the weekend I talked to eric and studied for my BMZ exam, which is tomorrow!  But I made note cards for this exam and hopefully that method will better prepare me, considering every other study method is a complete waste of time.  So my first semester of college is almost over, that is just fucking weird, it still doesn't seem like I'm in college even though i've been here since august.  However, the end of the semester bring FINALS, which i am totally dreading :0  Now i am taking a short break before I have to go to work at the mexican place, and here more of alisha's great stories ( you don't understand, i love for her stories, they are amazing!)  then i plan on coming home and studying and talking to eric as always.  I was excited cuz yesterday i talked to boo for a lil bit, and i talked to amber for a while as well.  I'm so excited to see them!!!!!!! I miss everyone sooo much.  Well gotta go get ready for work! <3"

"event","Today is veterans day...also meaning my brothers 16th birthday!  I called him today to wish him well but he was feeling under the weather, cuz he hurt his leg playing flag football :(  Other than that it was a rather uneventful day.  I went to english, then to chem and then i went to work.  the cool thing is we got paid time and a half today cuz it's veterans day, aka lots of cash.  Then i picked up my package at the post office building after taking a moment to chat with a one, dan valentine.  I talked to eric for a while, then i went to see a professor in the psychology department, she was really nice and she helped me kinda figure some things out, or at least helped me in the right direction.  So today i'm not so depressed which is good, maybe it's because i'll be home in 11 days!  Yep thanksgiving is around the corner, and i can't wait.  Eric is picking me up on tuesday after his classes, so i'll be home late tuesday night, but i don't mind cuz i'm driving with him, maybe we'll just get lost and then i could spend all week with him...that would be nice :)  but alas i has to go home and see my family and friends, cuz i really miss them to.  so i'll hang out with boo, and i'll get to see amber, it's gonna be wonderful!  so i scheduled for classes this week, and here's how it turned out, not too bad:

Eng 112
Itl 202
Zoo 116 aka BMZ
Psy 111
Gen 154 aka the study of aging in american society

so i guess it's not so bad, i'll have fun without chem :)"

"event","So the update in the amazing life of Lisa M. Ferrando...i may not be continuing on the premed track for much longer.  I haven't decided anything yet, but i'm kinda leaning more towards just majoring in psychology.  It's not that everything is impossible, the classes are hard, i'll admit that, but it just comes down to the fact that i hate the classes i'm in, i don't think school, or anything for that matter has ever made me this depressed in my life.  So the only solution, don't be a doctor, don't take the classes, do something that will make me happy.  The problem, i don't really have a backup plan, i'm still working on that one, but it's a step towards a happier lisa :)  And i'm still taking BMZ just in case i decide to keep up w/ the premed stuff, but i think i'm gonna drop chem and take another class that won't make me want to kill myself (again, not really suicidal, but it's just hard).  so here's what i think i'm taking next semester:

ENG 112
MBI 111 aka microbiology viruses and human disease
ZOO 116 aka BMZ
ITL 202
PSY 111 aka intro to psychology

so maybe i'll be ok after all, i just have a few more details to work out and i might be on the way to a new game plan for life, so wish me luck!"

I've got too much to think about and i feel alone.  I don't have a plan anymore, cuz what I did know isn't working.  I'm just glad he's there to keep me going.  I read my boo's live journal and it made me sad :( I miss you and our long talks, i'll call u soon, i promise.  I'll be home for thanksgiving in 15 days.  That should make everyone happy, at least for 6 days...So i'll keep trying until then, and while i'm home maybe i'll get my head straight, and i'll be ok for a while.  Just letting everyone at home know that I love them, and I miss all of you, and i'll see you soon! <3 Lisa"

"event","So this week as soon as I got back from fall break, I got really really sick!  I was stuffy and my throat hurt, my ear hurt and I wanted to sleep all the time.  The sleeping was the worst part, cuz I have 2 exams to study for.  That was really bad, cuz I would try and study, but then I would sleep so I ended up craming for both tests.  So needless to say, Chem was shit (i don't really want to talk about it, it makes me really hostile)  And I don't have much hope for BMZ cuz well, I wasn't at all prepared, but hey that's the price you pay for getting sick, right?  So When I called eric today, not only was I still a little sick, i was extremely pissed, frustrated, and confused about my abilities as a student.  College is a bunch of bull shit!  Well really not college, just the fucking premed program, cuz well I'm taking a bunch of classes that I'll NEVER EVER!!! use ever again in my whole fucking life!!!!!  So I'm a little hostle with the premed life right now, i wish i could just take anatomy and be content with my life, none of this chem and bio shit! I fucking hate it, and it makes me want to kill myself (well not really but it makes me really angry).  So enough about this crap that is college, I fucking hate it and I think it's bullshit! Just so the world knows that there is a pissed off premed runnin around the Miami Campus!!!!! Have a great day..."

"event","So this weekend was my first trip back home in 2 months.  Megan Schade and I drove home on thursday, and then eric brought me back to miami on sunday.  It was probably the greatest weekend ever, and I was more happy for those two days than I have been for a long time.  First I got home and saw my mamma and daddy, and my puppy of course.  I picked up my brother from soccer, and we drove home where eric was waiting for me with roses! isn't he sweet!  Then we all went to the outback, cuz eric has never been there, it was a lot of fun.  On they eric stayed over (ya the whole night, and in my room to boot) I felt like such a rebel! haha.  Then we woke up and he went home for a while, I went on a mission to get some stuff done, I went to visit my Grandma and then met back up with eric before he had to go to work.  My mamma and I went shopping a kohls it was great except I spent $140 on shit i needed to bring back to school with me, i was so upset, i hate spending money.  Then we went to long john's a saw my old crew, it was nice to see them again, i miss them.  So we went back home, I went to eric's and we watched kinsey, the movie about sex, it was very informative.  We went back to my house and he stayed over yet again, the entire night.  Saturday I saw my aunt judy and uncle tim, picked up perscriptions, and went shoppin with eric at walmart while he got his car fixed.  Then it was off to the JV boys soccer game to see moses( my brother) in action, it was a lot of fun, and I got to see some people that I actually wanted to see, like Katie Arden, who had a balloon that sang to give to her boyfriend, it was amazing!  After eric and i went to ambiance and the mall where I got my ear's peirced a third time, god i'm such a rebel now!  After that we picked up my boo and then we all played in walmart and went to eat'n'park.  It was so nice to see boo again, it was just like old times...Then it was sunday and it was time for me to head on back to miami :( so eric drove me back, it was really fun, we talked about the stupidest shit, like the personalities of the teenage mutant ninja turtles! how random!  He stayed for a while, and then there was a big tearfest when he left, it gets harder every time...So that was the events of this weekend, and now i'm back to the same old shit like classes and work, but who knows.  Peace out bitches!"

"event","Hey everyone!  Well let's see...1 day until I get to come home!!!!!!! Megan and I are now leaving at 2:30 because I got motivated to skip my BMZ class, then we can get home early.  Eric is gonna be in class when I get home but i'll see him later in the evening.  So today I didn't have to go to my chem lab because I got the lab done early.  I'm such a nerd, while i'm home eric and I are gonna study my biology stuff about genetics (he's a bio major so he's gonna lend his expertise).  Now lindsay and I are studying and listening to this hilarious comedian, I'm not exactly sure of his man, but I'm sure I'll find out, cuz wow is he funny.  Sami is sposed to call me tonight when she gets out of work, so we can plan our evening accordingly this weekend, then eric is gonna call me after work, maybe we'll continue our conversation about evolution.  It was interesting, we constructivally talked about how he belives in it and I think it's a load of crap, but it was still fun, cuz we can do that, and still end the conversation with I Love You.  So it kinda sux that we aren't gonna see each other on our one year, but we are celebrating this weekend while i'm here.  I got his card today, and it's really cute and I'm very proud of myself.  So about the sex in the basement, well it really has not significance, it's just this thing that the RA's are doing to try and have a sex talk with us.  We have been avoiding it all evening, and it's really been entertaining.

Things I did today:
*walked to class and had a discussion, in a circle... aren't you jealous
*went to chemistry...that was kinda boring
*went to chemistry lab lecture
*did not go to chem lab!
*got an A+ on last weeks chem lab, (hell yea)
*ate lunch with lindsay because everyone else was sleeping
*ate dinner with the girls (katie kelly, jojo, michelle, amanda, fay, jill,linday) I think that was everyone

Well I think that I'm gonna go for now, but I'll update later, and tell everyone about my one weekend home, away from the confindment of good old MU ohio."

"event","Hello everyone!  I don't know if I have any fans yet, but there is aways hope.  Well I'm doin laundry so I have some time to kill, and all my homework is done for tomorrow so I think I'll write for a lil bit.  I talked to boo last night, and she wasn't happy, she told me some distressing news, it made me think, ""wow some people are really assholes"".  May I take this moment to tell everyone how much I love my boyfriend, and how amazing he is for not blaming me for going away to college, and how strong he is for being committed to me even when I'm not around.  I just had to say that in light of this distressing news.  Anyway....2 days until I come home and visit everyone!!!!  Megan Schade and I are leaving Thursday after my class, and we will make the 5 hour trek home.  But it really pisses me off that I'll only be home for 2 days, I so would support monday off to, but hey you can't win everything right.  Let's see what else did I do..omg I got my first B on my lab report (in this case it is a good thing).  I worked on Monday, but Alisha didn't have any stories for me, but we had fun anyway!  My poor roomie is sick, I feel bad, cuz she can't talk, and she is just not in good spirits, so everyone needs to wish her to feel better :)  Well that's it for now, maybe I'll return tonight, but who knows...I'm a rebel, I am like the wind (that goes out to sami westover, haha)."

"event","So I got my exam for chem back today...it's not like it was bad, but it was lower than I expected to get and that doesn't make me happy. I really hate how premeds have to take all these fucking bullshit classes that will never help us in real life, then in med school we take completely different classes( anatomy, something i could pass).  I think it sux cuz i hate chem and bio but I have to pass then to get into med school! (aaahhh...sorry i had to vent).  Although my day started out well because my English class was canceled, so my paper was due by 5 in Leah's office, so I just got home from turning that in.  I wrote about Martin Luther King Jr...I mean come on, how much cooler could you get than fucking MLK!?  I have a lab practical on Monday, can you tell I'm excited..:(...well anyway I come home next weekend!!!!!!!! Now that I am excited about.  It kinda sux that we can't go to this haunted house thing, cuz it sounded fun, but there was like no way that eric could call off for saturday to go to that, and then sunday to bring me back to Miami.  So I've established that all I do with my life is homework, sleep and talk to eric...and that's completely fine with me, I don't really mind, Eric makes me happy and I'm sad he's not here :(  So I finally have some free time cuz it's friday, but I never know what to do when I have free time.  It's rainy and cold so I can't go outside, I dont' really want to study on my first day off, so I'm just chilling staring at the wall until eric get's off work.  Omg Jerry, my manager from Long John's, called me yesterday..he wanted to check up on me and see how I was doing! (how sweet was that, come on now that is a good boss).  I'm really excited about visiting all of the LJ's Crew as well, they are gonna be some of the first people I see when I go home (besides family, eric and boo) I can't wait!!!! I have soo much shit to do while i'm home it's kind of overwhelming
I have to:
1. go to my brother soccer game, it should be fun
2. get lots and lots of food to bring home for Katie and I (for those of you who don't know katie is my roomy)
3. get snow boots cuz i'm on fucking western campus
4. get more jeans cuz somehow in college your laundry doesn't last as long as it did at home
5. see my aunt before she goes to florida
6. see my grandma cuz she misses me and we talk on the phone a lot (aren't we cute)
7. go to ambiance with eric cuz i'm finally 18 bitches and i can sooo get in now!! ;)
8. go to the cemetery cuz they finally put up my grandpa's headstone, now I know where to find him

Well that sounds like a lot of shit, wish me luck on getting it all done.  College is stressful, but i'm sure most people already know that so I don't know why i'm stating it.  It's gonna be nice tonight cuz all the girls are goin to the twista concert at Millet and I'll be home in the peace and quiet, so I can talk to eric somewhere that isn't the front parking lot.  You know what I think though, they should have a rock concert here, like hardcore metal, then I could go and mosh in all the prissy bitches $200 shoes...wouldn't that be the best..( i know you're laughing, don't lie).  I would so support that idea...you know what else i support..having my car second semester.  That way I could come home and get off of fucking campus, and I could be at a rock concert like almost every weekend, cuz bogarts in cincinnati is like 20 minutes away!  So wish me luck with that to.
Ok i'm gonna attempt and find something to do so i'll update soon!"

NOT!  Then the bulk of my night was absorbed by my wonderful, amazing boyfriend!!:)  He called me at like 8:30 and we talked until 12:30 in the morning, it was the best conversation ever.  Well actually it was kinda sad cuz we talked about how we miss each other a lot and the possiblity of my coming home to be with him, it was seriously like crazy.  But then we talked about the happier times and how we met and our first kiss, and our first date...aren't we cute :)!!!  Now I'm talking to sami boo who is really excited that I got a livejournal, and so is janca...They are the only reason's I get the damn thing in the first place so I'm glad they like it.  Now I'm doing some homework and talking eric, he's at work, and he's kind of unhappy, and I feel bad cuz I'm making him depressed and it makes me feel like the worst girlfriend ever, even though he tells me I'm amazing and he loves me.

Well it's really depressing, Katie and I were talking and we have to laundry...AGAIN...That's really sad, I hate doing laundry cuz I have to haul like 20 pounds of shit down 3 floors and then bring it all back up, it sux.  So then I went to chem and did some in lecture studying for my exam on Weds...Ms. Cannal you would be sooo proud, you taught me well (just so you know I'm being serious, not sarcastic).  I also have an Italian exam, and I think I'm gonna rock out on it, cuz well, not to brag but I'm pretty sweet at Italian!  So I've got that on lockdown.  Then I went to work at the mexican place, aka listen to alisha's story of the week, I love it, it's like living in a soap opera, it's soooo much better and any episode of fuckin laguna beach!!!!  And today it was the first time I've worked after the whole change of seasons, it gets dark so early thing, and it was really scary.  Let me fill you in...I live in Thomson hall, and it's in the middle of nowhere... I kid you not...It's a 5 minute walk to get the end of the street that will take you into the heart of the campus...and I had to walk home in the dark and I was really scared.  so I just watched Laguna and super sweet sixteen w/ katie, jo and lindsay...Now I'm waitin for eric to call, then I'm sleeping.."

So here's what I think of Miami...1)great school, sweet premed program 2)I like all the girls in my dorm 3) Labs will be the reason I fail college 4)I don't know about my future here.  

But anyway...here goes the first update!  I just finished my BMZ lab report about the genetics of corn, can I tell you how thrilling that was (wohoo).  I have two exams next week, and I should probably start studying for them, but hey would I be a great procrastinator if I studied?! I so don't think so!  So I'll wait until tomrrow :).  I had to work today, it was really slow, but everyone should know that I make a mean smoothie, and my latte's are pretty sweet to.  I can't wait until midterm break, I finally get to go home and see my family/boo/eric!  I feel so left out, I'm like the only one who hasn't gone home yet, and it sucks... but my time at home is already planned out:
1) attack my family ( I haven't seen them in 2 months)
2) find eric and rape him
3) go to my brothers soccer game, and everyone is canfield should come and see them
4) dinner with sami, just like old times
5) shopping with sami for jeans and boots
6) stocking up on food in bulk, so I don't have to spend so much fucking money down here
7) relax for 5 hours on the drive back to good old MU Ohio

Sounds thrilling, don't you wish you were me!"

"event","blah blah blah i'm grounded. it sucks. i can't go out during the week. work is my refuge and that sucks. school is ok, but still lame. i can't see sarah. i can't see my friends, unless they come visit me, but hey, that's being grounded. i guess it could be much worse. saturday should be fun and sunday i should get to see sarah, finally. i guess i'm fine though.. my grades are still bad. fuck my academic career. it just seems hopeless, but i'm gonna do my best, regardless.

i'm pretty pumped about this jazz show i've been listening to on the radio. it's on 90.5 WDUQ from 10-11pm every night. it's really great. i mean, other than the stuff with vocals, which i don't really like, it's all good.

alright, that is all. -xoxo"

"event","yesterday was nice. sarah and i have been together for two months. in celebration of that and me getting my fat income tax return, we went to house of chen in cranberry for dinner. it was really nice. i've been there a bunch of times before, but it was her first time. they have the best chinese in the area, in my opinion. after that we headed over to jo-ann fabrics because sarah has been wanting to go to the new one in cranberry. it's fucking massive. like a department store but just for crafts. she didn't get anything but it was fun to look around and use their insanely clean bathrooms.

from cranberry, we went to goodwill in rochester. sarah wanted to get some stuff for her sister and i wanted to buy useless bullshit, and we did just that. she got some shirts for her sister(and one for me) and i got a playschool xylophone keyboard and yet another herb alpert album. this one's good because it has spanish harlem on it. you probably don't recognize it by name, but to hear it, i'm sure you would know it.

anyway, after that we drove around and parked and drove around some more for a good two or three hours. it was really nice. it rained alot. i love rain so that was nice too. i dropped sarah off around 9:30 and went on home. not too much to say about the rest of the evening. today, i came home from school and took a nap because the weather made me so incredibly comfortable. tonight's got nothing but work and sleep in store for me.

oh yeah, jason got me another app. for the masonic village. i'll probably get the job this time. cheryll's been putting in a good word for me, plus jason's recommendation should look pretty good. i dont know, though, we'll see.

oh oh yeah, something was rattling around under my seat in my car and it bothered sarah and i so she looked and it was my fucking circle of dead children - starving the vultures CD!!! i was soooo excited. it had been missing for a good year and i had lost all hope a long time ago. thank you sarah and thanks you mysterious noises under my car seat! -xoxo"

"event","alright, i had a great time on friday, given the sick lipstick didn't play the show we went to. we ended up not paying, so it worked out i guess. either way, all of us(sarah, rick, trena, marissa and myself) drove to pittsburgh in ricky's death wagon playing padiddle all the way. it was most intense. we picked up chelsea, went to eat'n'park, went to the ""show"" in homestead, it was really little and weird, but there was plenty of free food and such so it wasn't a total loss. anyway, we just went back to sarah's after that for fun games and prizes. on the whole, it was a great time. i slept until like 1pm yesterday too. that was nice, even though i missed out on a big chunk of what turned out to be a gorgeous day. i did get to see kari and tyler in the afternoon, so that was nice.

last night, i worked 6-10, but after that jason tyler and genny came over and we watched kung pow. that movie is so ridiculous. after that, we played some nintendo and listened to music. they left around 2:30am and i went right to bed. i got up this morning around 8am, as usual on sundays. we went to church and i talked to my old friend todd about good times working at mcdonalds. i guess he's a manager there, now. after church my g-ma told me she had a stack of records that i could have. i was pretty pumped.

my dad and i left church in search of breakfast/lunch/brunch/anything edible and ended up at the monte cellos in cranberry. when we got there, we were one of three little groups of people there. it was nice to not have a lot of noise while dining. we ate drank and bullshitted for a but and we got home around 1pm. i got in my car and drove up the hill to the grandparents' house. granny hooked me up with a bunch of cool records to add to my collection. a couple being: elvis - live in hawaii(double LP), don mclean - american pie(decent good condition), and a killer fats domino double LP. all together there were quite a few. those were just some highlights. oh, and i have a couple records of my aunts singing and my aunt joan playing the trumpet, but they need a player that can do 78rpm. mine, however does not. if you know where i could get one or if you have one, give me a holler cause i'd like to hear them. they're both from 1953-54 and were recorded in ambridge.

i just got back from my uncle leroy and aunt donna's 50th anniversary. it was really nice to see all my family and catch up with them. they all had to make sure and tell me how much weight i lost and how much i look like my dad. i don't mind though. it was a good time.

now it's work, 5-9. wahoo. -xoxo"

"event","alright, it's been a while since the last update and i could care less. nothing happened that i really felt compelled to put in here. sarah and i were having some rough spots but we came through with flying colors. that's a funny way to put it.. either way, we're doing just fine, and it's actually going to be two months on monday. it seems like longer, though.

today, we had a field trip to the convention center for a college fair. it was really cool. i only took stuff for two colleges, though. CCBC and the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortuary Science. CCBC is just a fall back, in case PIMS doesn't accept me or something like that. i'm really excited about going there though. i really think i could do well. the classes all look like they would be very interesting and it's nice because it's right in pittsburgh. we'll see how that all goes in the future, but for now, i'm just an aspiring mortician.

we(andy, beano and i) were only in the convention center for maybe 15 minutes. then we left the facility and walked to eides to check out some music. they had so much shit i wanted, but i ended up getting the new fantomas - delirivm cordia. it's got a really neat layout and the music itself is awesome. which is to be expected from such a good band. this is definitely a concept album, though. it's one track at 74 minutes long. there is actual music up to about 53 minutes then just a constant noise for the rest of the disc. there is a surgical/medical theme throughout the album. it's very interesting to say the least.

i hung out with kari this evening, after finally getting my car because i locked the fucking keys in it AGAIN. i really need to figure a way to fasten my extra key to my wallet so this isn't a problem from now on. we'll see what i can do. anyway, we hung out at the mall for a bit. saw sarah and we celebrated/mourned her last day at Jody's with some free food. it was extra good.. and extra free. thanks baby. we were at the mall for some time, then left and went to a few places.(wal-mart, disc-continued, low-es) then we met jason at king's and stayed there till i had to go home around 9:30. i took kari home and she was NOT happy to see that art's car was parked in front of her house, and for good reason. he is the biggest loser/douche bag/motherfucker/ignorant asshole you've ever seen and i wouldn't want him in my house either... her mom could do so much better than him, but she always goes back.

oh well, the sick lipstick is tomorrow. i'm pretty excited. it's going to be a fun time... rick and i with a van-load of girls. haha we'll see what happens. good night everyone. -xoxo"

"event","i haven't been really gung-ho about livejournal these days. mainly because it's become the focal point of far too many people's lives and i won't have it. oh, and because the other day i tried to update about my wonderful valentines day with sarah, but after typing the entire thing out three times and it rejecting it in one way or another every single time, i just gave up. if you care to inquire about what we did, i'll gladly tell you. if not, just know that it was a very nice time and we also had a ton of fun going to the monster truck jam and dinner on sunday.

i changed the picture in my journal. i needed something grim, and i thought, ""hey albert, what's more grim than an old black and white polaroid of a muder/suicide?"" and put that up. i actually really like the picture. it's been on my computer for some time now. it was either that or a horrible lacerated forearm.. i might put that one up later. it's delicious gory fun.

anyway, i've got other things i should be doing. good night. -xoxo"

thursday i worked. blah.

two-hour delay this morning. it was ok. i just like them for the fact that they make my classes shorter. fuck sleeping in. it just makes me more tired.. not to say that i don't do it, though. school was lame. i keep failing my math class. i need help like a single mother with a crack addiction... anyway, my day went rather quickly and that's always nice.

after school, i headed out to beaverland and hung out with kari all afternoon and we watched her little brother max, which is always a hoot. we had a good time. liane came over in the evening and then i went home for a few minutes. i ate some dinner, then jason picked me up. we picked tyler up and we all went back to kari's to watch movies. we watched airplane! and 12 monkeys. they are both very good movies.  caroline and abbey came over at later times in the night, and it was nice to see them. but not only did we watch those movies, my dad rented lost in translation, which i cannot wait to see, and jackie brown. i love it.

i love movies so much that it makes me mad that i'm not going to get that job at suncoast, and i'd like to work at hollywood video in rochester, but i've heard to much bad stuff about that place to give them a shot. i don't know.. i just need a better paying job with more hours. that's all there is to it.

anyway, from all of this, just know that: i love sarah, i hate school, i love my friends and i hate my job. good night. -xoxo"

anyway, on a less nerdy topic, things have been good lately. sarah and i had some rough spots, but she had her reasons and we talked it out. i'm glad no rash decisions were made. she really does mean the world to me...and thensome.

the show on saturday was fantastic. the last 5 bands we watched were stupendous. there were a handful of bad bands, but the good ones made it all worth it. a waking nightmare agreed to play our show at roboto in march which is fucking awesome. if all of this goes off without a hitch, i'll be so happy.

last friday, sarah and i went to the south side for dinner at zenith. it was a really nice place, alittle cold, but still really neat. being that it was a vegan restaurant, everything was AOK for us. i had a cup of chili and a hummus wrap. they were both amazing. sarah got a salad and some sort of stew with rice and vegetables. it was all really good. not to mention the pie we had for dessert, which was a walnut, chocolate, peanut butter, tofu with a crumb-type crust piece of heaven. i loved it. in the front of zenith, is a vintage/antique store. it was so awesome. we looked mostly at clothes. i got a badass sweater, but nothing else cause i was alittle strapped for cash. we went to goodwill after that and then drove to robinson and finally home. it was a great time, but driving was sooo bad. i had never driven on roads that bad anywhere, let alone in the city and on the highway, but we made it home fine and in one piece.

over the weekend i hung out with tyler kari abbey and jason a couple times. it was cool to just go to the mall and hang out with them...and eat mad fucking mozzerella sticks at jason's house. hell yeah. -xoxo"

"event","well well well, last night was a good time, to say the least. i went to sarah's right after i got out of school because she had the day off. we sat around her house for a bit, then decided to go get some pizzas from giant eagle in rochester. we got those and some other things and brought them back to her house. we had the pizzas, falafel and pita with spicy pepper hummus. all of which, was amazing. i had never tried falafel or hummus before and i was surprised at just how good they both are. if you have never had them, they are worth at least a taste. you might be surprised. anyway, after dinner we watched american psycho and i freaked out sarah because she found out that i'm a closet serial-killer, but i think she's come to terms with that and the fact i'm not going to kill her, so we're fine now. then we went upstairs and listened to music and did some other things that i'm sure you don't care to hear about, so i'll spare you. i got home this morning around 5:45am because she feared her mother's early arrival. she ended up not coming home till around 10am, but i didn't mind leaving that early, because i totally understood her paranoia. either way, i had an extremely good time and i am completely enthralled in sarah.

and to my friends, i haven't heard from you guys in a few days. i'd like to hang out sometime soon. i don't work until 7pm on saturday. if any of you aren't busy we should do something. i'll call you or you can get a hold of me if there's anything you'd want to do. talk to you soon. -xoxo"

"event","the past couple days have been really great. we went to pittsburgh the other night. it was jason tyler kari sarah and myself, because abbey had to babysit. we drove up to eide's and met up with edgeninja. he was a nice guy. when we first got there i thought i was going to piss myself and since eide's doesn't have a public restroom, sarah and i went across the street to the greyhound bus station. of course we went to the WRONG entrance first so we had to walk all the way around to the main lobby. it was soooo fucking cold, but we made it, and when we did we were greeted by some of the coolest crazies in town. they talked to themselves, stared at the walls and harassed sarah! it was great! haha, anyway, i bought the ' codc - exotic sense of decay' picture disc 7"". sarah bought sleater kinney and the yeah yeah yeahs on vinyl. i feel bad though. her record player is fucked. the speed is all messed up. i'm sure the belt just needs tightened but i'm afraid that's beyond my ability. we'll see, though.

after the eide's trip, we all went to steak and shake(fuck their shitty-ass french fries) and ate dinner. we left there for best buy, cd warehouse and halfpricebooks where i picked up a book on the boston strangler(s). it should be really interesting. after leaving robinson, we took sarah home then went to abbey's to see her and eat some more dinner. that was pretty much the end of the night. all in all it was a blast. thanks everyone for a great time.

yesterday i helped my friend eric move from ambridge back to baden. we moved everything in his fucking house. my arms are really sore, but we were paid with pizza so it was nice.  that ran alittle further over than i would have liked, but nonetheless i left there around 1pm and stopped at home, changed, then left for abbey's to pick up my cell phone. after i picked that up, i called sarah and then went over there. we hung out, i tried to fix her record player unsuccessfully and her mom bought us veggie bugers from BK and curly fries from arby's. i was surprised with just how good their veggie burgers are.

just a side-note; my week without meat was a success. i think i'm going to keep it going for a while longer. maybe i'll stick to it? i don't know....

anyway, after all that, i had to drop sarah off at work. i came home, sat around for a bit then left for work myself. that was pretty much the end of yesterday.

today was church till noon and after that i was supposed to jam with steve, but he never called. i managed to find a snowsuit for sarah, because she's going to 7springs today. she was just going to wear a bunch of layers, but i wasn't having that. she needed the proper attire. anyway, after i dropped that off i did some grocery shopping and came home.. i've been periodically drumming, downloading music, listening to music and eating all afternoon. haha i have to work tonight at 6. the gang is supposed to hang out tonight. we'll see what happens there. jason is supposed to stop by GE after he gets off. we'll do some brainstorming and come up with something fun.

oh and a special thanks to jasennnnnnnnfor making my journal cool like everyone else's. whatever, i just wanted you to be able to see the picture in the background as you read my journal. it's just a diagram of some man's alleged ""suicide"". i'm not sure who, but it's brutal, so it doesn't matter. thanks jasennnnnn-xoxo

i couldn't be happier with sarah. it's nice because i get to see her alot. we always have a good time whether we're out and about or just sitting at home or on the phone. i'm going to pick her up from school today and we're going to hang out for a little bit, then jason kari tyler and i with the variables of abbey and sarah are going to pittsburgh. we're going to eide's and then somewhere to eat. the whole space situation sucks, though. because if abbey goes, sarah can't go and vice versa. i just want everyone to go, and i'd drive too, but with gas and all.. i don't know. we'll see. maybe i will drive... we'll figure something out.

at any rate, i hope tonight is fun. i have to go do some chores, then i'm off to get sarah. have a splendid evening. -xoxo"

ok, so a few days ago i broke up with jenn. it was a difficult decision, but in the end i think i made the right choice to go out with sarah. we get along so well and just have an amazing time together. jenn's been taking it kind of rough, but i think she's getting better as time passes. i don't know.. it was a big mess, but i'd say everything is going to be alright now. sorry if i didn't tell some of you about this, too. it was just something i needed to figure out for myself.

school is going pretty much the same as always. pretty laid back for the most part, but i have to really start getting in gear in alg. 2 or i'm guaranteed an E for the nine weeks period, and that's not allowed. other than that, i'd say things are just peachy. lacey and i are even pretty much back to normal. things were kind of weird for a bit, but we're past that and now we're friends again, so that's nice.

i work way too much, and get too few hours. if that makes any sense. i work 5 days this week and i'm getting just under 18 hours. tell me that's not messed up. these three hour shifts are fucking bullshit. i need to start looking for a new job. all i want is a job that will keep me busy and give me reasonible hours with a decent pay. i probably won't find that, though. ok, that's it for now. good night eveyone. -xoxo"

"event","well, i'll start with yesterday. it was kari's 16th birthday and i'm really glad i got to spend the entire day with her. it was great. we had such a good time. we started off the day with me waking up late, but that's beside the point. jason kari tyler and myself went to eide's in pittsburgh and got more records books and cds than we know what to do with. i bought kari the Gashleycrumb Tinies: by edward gorey. she really liked it, as i assumed she would. it's just a cute little book full of brutal misfortune for twenty-six unlucky kids.

my records/cds i bought go as follows:

<b>LP</b>
Lightning Bolt - Ride the Skies
5ive - self titled
Cephalic Carnage - Lucid Interval

<b>7""</b>
Locust/Arab On Radar - Split

<b>CD</b>
Pelican - Australasia
Lightning Bolt - Wonderful Rainbow
Circle of Dead Children - Exotic Sense of Decay

i know i spent more money than i would have liked to, but it's all stuff i'll listen to everything alot. it was christmas money anyway, so i think i should have bought gifts for myself, and all i want is music, so i don't care.

after the whole eide's experience, we went to eat'n'park and had a decent meal. we left there and took tyler back to his g-ma's and jason kari and i went back to my house. we watched jacob's ladder, which i thought was a fantastic movie. after that we just layed around till we had to leave for the bowling alley. i went and picked up tyler and we got the lanes reserved(again) and waited for everyone to show up. altogether it was BSASO, TfSC+mary and jess, jason tyler erik john u.'s sister and myself. we had a grand ol'e time and i did rather well tossing the ball for not going bowling in a good year... at least.

whence we had all finished tossing our balls, we went to king's for a good time. i successfully left that establishment with a full stomach and not having spent a dime. not because i ""ate and ran"", but rather, because i have awesome friends that treat me all-to-well. but i definitely appreciate it. that was pretty much the end of the night. i came home, talked to jenn for a bit(imissher) and talked to sarah on the phone for a couple hours. that was really nice. we never really talked for that long.

tonight is the infamous <i>new years eve!</i> we decided everyone is just going to stay over at my house tonight.(sorry andrew, it just worked out this way) it should be alot of fun though. it's gonna be most of my closest friends chilling around, and i'd have it no other way. i think that about sums it up. i don't think i'll be nostalgic or anything and review my year. i might come up with a quick summary just for the hell of it, but nothing drawn out and meaningful. -xoxo"

"event","a couple days ago i hung out with booty tyler jason kari and shannon at booty's. we watched o brother where art thou. i love that movie, but i felt bad for the kids that hadn't seen it because i'm sure they couldn't understand alot of what was said. shannon and kari had to leave before it was over, but we finished it and jason gave me my christmas presents that finally came in from robotic. he got me the vcr album and east west blast test. i was so fucking happy. those are two excellent albums. thanks alot man. umm, we didn't do too much the rest of the night, but before i left, i had to make sure and drop the chip-dip in his living room and it went EVERYWHERE. it was nuts. i ended back at the house at like 4am, though. oh, where does the time go...

yesterday went to church and got home around noon. i hung out with my little cousin and since i'm trying to gradually get him into good music, i've been letting him listen to shit like converge and fassw. he likes them, but i think he has a tough time listening to them for a while. he's only 11, so i understand. i let him borrow a couple hatebreed albums to get some hardcore stuff in his system. he really likes them...  it's a start. i'll have him listening to good music, yet. i'll just be happy if he stops with the rap and linkin park.(sorry juliah, haha)

around 2:30 i went over to sarah's house. we hung out there for a little bit. she has a really nice house and an awesome dog. we left there and went to walmart so she could pick up an embroidery needle she wanted. we got that and went to robinson so she didn't have to be home for her mother's dinner party. we successfully avoided that by going to the mall for dinner. we hung out there, barnes and noble and michael's crafts store. we decided that i'm going to take up knitting and i don't care how much flack i get from everyone about being gay, i'm going to try to get good. it seems hard, but i got a book and a pair of needles. my mom fucking threw away all of the yarn we used to have, though. i was so pissed! my grandma has to have some. i'll ask her. after we left robinson, i took sarah home. i had a really good time.

i left there and called tyler. we hung out at his place for a spell, listening to music and talking about what we want to buy at eides tomorrow. before we left there, we had to take down his christmas tree... might i add this was the christmas tree <i>from hell.</i> i've never felt a tree with needles THAT fucking sharp. it was so brutal,  but we conquered it. tyler and i went back to my house and waited for jason. he came, picked us up and we went to kari's to ""help"" her babysit. the kid was really cute, but left not long after we got there. abbey came over, we watched signs and a bit of the italian job. i had to be home around 2am, though, so we had to leave. all in all, i had a good time with everyone. it was a really long day.

i have to work at 6pm today. i think i might go to king's with jason tonight. i haven't been there in ages. tomorrow is the big field trip too. we're going to eides to spend ridiculous amounts of money and kari's birfday party is tomorrow night. we's going bowling bowling. i can't wait. i haven't been bowling in so long. it should be a really fun time. -xoxo"

"event","so, my christmas went very well. i didn't get a whole lot, but i don't really care. i didn't want much. i got the third season of family guy, a couple robert crumb comics, cd-rs, a heater for my very cold room and about $140 from people who didn't know what to get me, so that was nice. i got to spend some quality time with my sister, her boyfriend, my cousins and most of all, jenn, at the end of the night.

we woke up around 9am to eat breakfast and open presents at our house. it was my mom and dad, my sister and her boyfriend, and i. then we headed up to my g-ma hall's in zelienople. that was a good time, because my family are so funny and the food was great. we left there around 2:30pm and headed to my granny's house. we played trivial pursuit there and i did my share of pwning with two pie pieces vs. everyone else's NONE...  anyway, i left there around 5pm and went to jenn's to see her and her family. i bought her, her sister and her parents gifts and i think they all thoroughly enjoyed them.(unless they're all really good at lying, lol) i had a <i>really</i> good time there, though. we played simpsons jeopardy and i was the one getting pwned. that family knows WAY too much about the simpsons. we sat around for a while and then ended up watching chicago. i didn't watch it all (but strangely, i'd like to), because i had to be getting home.

you might notice that it's 5:25am. no, i didn't stay up all night. i was watching a movie on ifc called buddy boy. it was really good and i think i might see if i can find it at suncoast tomorrow... i love movies. oh but anyway, i was watching it and fell asleep.. i woke up at the end, but it wasn't the end of the one i was watching. they re-aired it at like 3:45am and i caught the end of the <i>second</i> time around. lol now i'm not that tired, but i think i might make myself sleep. jason and i (and others?) are going to breakfast tomorrow morning. -xoxo"

"event","alright.. i just got back. as for my hair, it's three inches shorter and i think it looks dumb.

and right before i left, i was playing my drums and my glasses fell off and when i went to pick them up, they scraped across a piece of metal on my drum throne. there is a fucking massive scratch on my left lens now. when i was out, just now, i stopped into Lens Crafters at the mall and showed the lady working there. she pretty much said ""we can't fix it, you're fucked, good bye."" so i left there, went to say hi to booty, who was working, and i wanted bitch to him about my glasses and hair, but jake was in there and i didn't care to stick around for very long, so i said hey and left.

i think i'm gonna ask dawn if she can do anything about my hair.. or if anything really does need done and it's just me that doesn't like it. i really don't know about my glasses, though. i mean, i can just look past it, but looking at the computer screen, it is <i>so</i> evident. i have another pair of glasses, but i don't like them at all.. i guess i'll just have to live with the scratch...

i'm so tired, i don't want to work tonight, but we have a luncheon tonight and tomorrow, which is always nice. free food and drinks, can't beat that... <i>not with a stick!</i> -xoxo"

"event","my weekend was good.. quality time with jenn, an awesome show full of awesome kids.(minus the ""too punk for you"", studded jacket, patch wearing, bottle throwing, childish, ugly, out-of-place motherfuckers) the only real downside of my weekend was the eight and a half hour day i worked on saturday. i stocked pop and water the ENTIRE time. my back was dead after that.

today was our last day of school till jan. 5, and i couldn't be happier. i'm so sick of that place it's not funny, and now i have to really get it in gear though, cause my grades are slipping. the break's gonna be a blast, except for the fact that jenn is going to california for a week. she's leaving a couple days after christmas. i guess the upside to that will be more quality time with my friends, who i don't see as much as i used to.

right now..... i'm going to get a haircut. i'm really scared. i keep thinking i want it short again, but i remember how my hair looks short and then i don't want to cut it at all, and my feelings about it just go around and around like that.... i just wish i had normal, straight hair. that would be so nice, but whatever.. i think i'm going to get at least two inches off and we'll see how it looks and go from there....wish me luck. -xoxo"

if anyone else had been wondering about that very strange and scary figure in the background of jason's journal(xtrendyx), i did some research, so here you go...

<b>The Burning of Zozobra</b>

""Zozobra is a hideous but harmless fifty-foot bogeyman marionette. He is a toothless, empty-headed facade. He has no guts and doesn't have a leg to stand on. He is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. He never wins. He moans and groans, rolls his eyes and twists his head. His mouth gapes and chomps. His arms flail about in frustration. Every year we do him in. We string him up and burn him down in ablaze of fireworks. At last, he is gone, taking with him all our troubles for another whole year. Santa Fe celebrates another victory. Viva la Fiesta!"" - A.W. Denninger

La Fiesta de Santa Fe is the oldest continuously celebrated community festival in the United States, held annually the weekend after Labor Day in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Burning of Zozobra, Old Man Gloom, is the best part of Fiesta for many and it kicks off the weekend. It is a unique spectacle you won't soon forget.

"event","last few days have been ok. yesterday i hung out with jesse for the afternoon and booty for the evening. it was a great time, besides the fact that i spent <i>way</i> too much time at the mall. i did get to hang out with sarah on her break. that was cool. i saw so many people i knew last night, it as ridiculous. anyway, after we left the mall, booty and i got ice cream from bruster's in aliquippa. i didn't even know that one existed, but the it was really good. after that, we just chilled at my place for the night and had a good time.

today i went home with jenn after school and i had a great time talking to her dad, her sister and her. they're a really fun time. when it started getting dark, jenn and i grabbed some dinner from the house and went to cranberry. we went to the craft store, b&n, tj maxxx, and wal-mart. i got some ideas of things i want to buy people for christmas, but there are still so many people i just don't know about... i hate buying christmas presents, simply for the fact that i never think they're going to like i what i give them... anyway, after our adventurous trip to cran-town, we came back to my place and hung out till like 9:30 when she left. my parents got gay though and yelled at me after she left because we didn't talk to them and we were in my room the whole time... i really don't care. they can just get over it. 

i'm going up to see abbey and kari tomorrow before i work at 6. that will be nice. i haven't seen them since like, last week. that is all for this post. until next time. -xoxo"

"event","yesterday i went into work at 4:30, failing to remember that i don't start until 6pm. pissed off, i drove home and offered to, in the time i now had, take her to get a christmas tree. she called around and found a good deal at ace hardware in ambridge. we went down there, got the tree, took it home and i went to work. it looks really nice. i like it. finally kind of getting me into the christmas mood. my mom started making all her christmas cookies too. i'm pumped.

today was ok. kinda boring, but ok, nonetheless. jenn called and woke me up this morning. she came and got me and we went to this spirit shop in sewickley she wanted to go to. it was pretty weird. alot of insense and buddah statues, things like that. she got something for her friend for christmas and we went back to her place. we talked to her parents for a bit and she showed me her digeriedoo(spelling?). it's pretty cool. we ate some tuna and crackers, her parents left and we did too soon after.  we came back to my house, i finished a <i>killer</i> game of tetris, i made her a cd and we just layed around till she had to work at like 3:45pm. then my mom sent me to the dollar stores to find her some colored lights, so i took her money and was on my way. i'm coming out of family dollar and i hear ""heeeelp...  heeeeelp."" in this pathetic, old voice. i look around the parking lot and see a decrepit old woman and she's hanging onto her car door for dear life. i run over to her aid and hoiste her back into her car and get her shoe back on that had fallen off...  she didn't say thank you, she didn't say much of anything.. i just told her to be safe and i shut the door and she drove away.

<b>....i really never want to be that old....</b>

anyway, i got some dinner and now i'm home.. waiting to go to work at 6pm. i'd really like to do something tonight. booty's back in town. it'd be nice to see him again. we'll see what happens after i get off work. -xoxo"

"event","well, an endless amount of boredom has brought me back to this, my livejournal-sweet-livejournal.

i haven't done a whole lot lately. i was just hella-sick last week, but i am almost fine now. just a little cough here and there. i've been hanging out with jenn a bunch. we have fun. we saw elf last night. i was surprised at how much i laughed. if you like will ferrell, that's your movie, but if he annoys you, don't bother. it's his same old, loud humor.

i haven't seen much of abbey kari.. or really anyone lately. i hung out with jason the other night, but that's it. maybe tomorrow? i'm off work. we'll see what goes down.

jenn got her drivers license today. i'm so happy for her. she was not optomistic at all.. mainly because she failed the first time and didn't bother driving since, but we were all proud of her. let's just hope my uncanny ability to get into trouble with the law doesn't rub off on her.

i might be getting a new job soon at the home depot in cranberry. i'd be loading and unloading trucks and taking shit to peoples' cars for them. shit like that, making $8-$9 an hour. that would be very nice. i just have to check with TJ tonight at work, because he said his dad could hook us up with the jobs.

i imagine that's it for now.. i have to go to work tonight at 6 till 10pm. it's a pain, but there's no heat in my house right now, so i won't be very reluctant to leave. it's 60 degrees in here. goddamn columbia gas. fuck those guys and their heavy machinery all over my fucking lawn. i hope they're done installing the new gasline soon. this is ridiculous. -xoxo"

"event","oh my.. if you haven't gotten your wisdom teeth out or can avoid it at any costs.. dont get it done! this had to have been the worst pain i had ever experienced. in the time between when the dentist's  medication wore off and when my mom wasn't home in time with the vicadin, i thought i was going to die. it was horrible. i just layed in my bed with my swollen cheeks and prayed that she wouldn't take too much longer. although, after i got my pills, i was feeling much better. my sister and her boyfriend, mark, came over. they got me family guy seasons 1 and 2 for my birthday. it's so awesome. i love family guy. dawn and jason came over later and we watched a few episodes and i pretended that my mouth didn't feel like it was smashed with a sledgehammer.. it was still a good time, though. since i didn't get to see abbey yesterday, she told me one of my presents she got me... a dalmation fish! his name is dog. i'm <i>very</i> excited for his arrival. my mom unknowingly cleaned out spazz's old tank last night too. talk about good timing. i still have to get her other present and kari's as well. hopefully i can go up there today.

anyway, thanks to <b>everyone</b> that sent their best yesterday. i love all  of you soooo much. you really helped me through my operation too. thanks for a very happy birthday. -xoxo"

"event","well last night my temp. filling on my molar got alittle chip in it and somewhat re-exposed the nerve it was covering... the dentists though, rather than recovering the tooth, they would just schedule my wisdom teeth extraction for tomorrow and take that tooth out with them. tomorrow is my birthday.. i had plans, but they're all to shit now, because i'm gonna be laid out with a swolen jaw. -xoxo

ps. i'm gonna have my party on friday. talk to me for the details i guess. i'm not sure of them, but we'll figure something out."

"event","i am officially in good with the peddler of good luck. i managed to get out of all charges and fines for my ticket. the cop that dealt with me was very cooperative and understood the situation, and for kenafle, i think he just wanted to get me out of the court room so he could go home and eat dinner. haha well, anyway, i'm officially done with that.

round 2: november 17th, 10:00am. i have to go fight my speeding ticket. that i will probably not win, although i already paid the ticket itself, i will still get the points.. hopefully they will drop it to only 5mph over and not <b>24mph over</b>. -xoxo"

"event","i went to see lacey yesterday. surprisingly, she looks fine, aside from her bandages on her chin, wrists and knee. she was taking it well.. but it's such a shame.. i really hate seeing her like that. today, around 2:00pm she had surgery on her jaw and, as a result, had it wired shut.. it will be shut for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. i feel so bad....

well, i didn't have my root canal last night. it turns out, there isn't enough of the tooth left to salvage it, so they want to just take it out when they take out my wisdom teeth. we set up an appointment for the day after thanksgiving, but our insurance only covers 60% of the cost of the procedure, so we have to come up with 40% of the cost. which comes to around $510. we could probably cash in stock or something to get it, but that is just money that my family shouldn't have to pay. i'll probably still have it done.. i'm not sure.

right now, i have to be heading off to the magistrate to appear at my hearing for the bus ticket i got.(note post: sept.27) i will probably still get fined $350 and get my driver's license suspended for 60 days. here's to them just throwing out the case, though... i hate life. -xoxo"

"event","wow.. this has to be one of the worst weeks, already. today, after school, chelsea and lacey rode chelsea's horses to my house to say hi. they got there just before i was about to leave for work, so i couldn't talk long. just before i left lacey jokingly asked if they could run through my yard. i said yes and drove away as they galloped through the gulley beside the road in front of my house. i get to work and i'm there for no longer than 10-15mins when i get a phonecall from lacey's mother. she proceeds to tell me that lacey was tossed off of her horse and busted up her jaw/wrist on the road. it turns out, i missed this by.. no more than 30 seconds. anyway, they took her to the ER at st. francis in cranberry and she ended up getting around 30 stitches on her chin/jaw? area, her wrists are badly cut and scraped because of the way she landed and she broke a tooth and messed up her braces pretty badly. this totally fucked with me.. just knowing that i saw her seconds before something like that happened. i was so worried about her at work i made myself sick, because i didn't know she was going to be at least somewhat ok until my shift was almost over. that's just one of the things that make this week shit. 

the next is the chi chis hepatitis outbreak that may have infected quite a few friends of mine and people i know. dawn, lisa, hannah, bryan, christine and countless others ate at the restaraunt within the past week, making them possible carriers of the disease. they all have to be checked as soon as possible. that's got me worried. it can be treated, but still.. knowing that your friends might have hepatitis is an awful feeling. i hope they're all fine, and if they're not.. that they get a hefty settlement out of it.

it gets better.. i have a root canal scheduled for 4:30pm tomorrow afternoon, and luckily i got out of work so i can just stay at home tomorrow night and not do anything. wednesday i have my court hearing for the bus ticket i got a while back.. i'll probably lose my license for 60 because of that.. not to mention the $350 fine.

again, i'd like to appologize for constantly whining my journal, but everything just sucks so bad that the good things just seem so insignificant when compared... -xoxo

ps. my birthday is on friday.."

"event","last night was the norma jean/figure 4 show in erie. it was a really fun time. jason abbey and myself rode up in one car and jaison justin and ronelle rode up in jaison's car. his car got messed up, and he had to drive home on a donut. that's a real miracle becuase you're not supposed to go more than 10 miles on a donut. after they left, jason abbey booty and myself went to booty's dorm and then to eat'n'park. it was all a really fun time, and i didn't get in till 4:30am this morning. i went to bed and woke up at 7am, realized i wanted to sleep more, got up at 9am and went to school. while i was at work today, my parents went to grove city outlets/cranberry and got me a bunch of birthday presents. they got me a new turntable, a nice winter jacket and... a cd burner!! wahoo. but anyway, it's an internal burner, so i'm going to unhook the computer for easier insallation. here's to many many cds in my future :] -xoxo"

"event","two of my friends are going to the emergency room tonight... abbey is going to get her stomach checked because her medicine doesn't seem to be working..and i just talked to jaison and he's on his way because they checked his house and apparently it's full of carbon menoxide. i swear, if anything happens to either of them, i will be so upset. i haven't been in the best mental state lately and that would just put me over. i worry so much about abbey too.. i dont tell her, because i know she doesn't want the sympathy or whatever, but i worry.. alot. i just want her to be better.. 

lacey started getting depressed about her life today and i don't know what to tell her, because there's really nothing that can make her feel any better. i'll just keep being there for her and assuring her that everything.. eventually, will be alright. 

i got to see caroline and tyler yesterday. that was really nice. i love those two. i wanted to get the other parts of T<b>f</b>SC as well, but they were MIA, so we just went to circuit city and i got a new computer mouse. it's really nice.. and runs smooth. it's the optical kind. anway, i have to go to work in a bit.. i hope abbey and jaison are ok. -xoxo"

"event","i know it's been awhile since my last post.. i've just been waiting for things to get better, because i hate just bitching on here. i know you guys don't want to read about my problems all the time. i also know that you would probably want to know what i've been up to, as well. so i'm kinda stuck.. because things aren't getting better.

today, for instance, i was eating a chicken tender on my break at work, when all of the sudden, i feel something sharp in my mouth. as luck would have it, i large chunk of my last molar on the right side has chipped off and i don't know why... it's really sharp and rubs up against the back of my tongue. it seems to have also given me a slight speach impediment. i guess i'll be going to the dentist sometime tomorrow... i can't wait :/

last night, i got off work at 9:00pm and dawn and jason asked me to go get something to eat with them. we drove back to my house so i could change/ask the parents if i could go. we get back to my house and are just sitting around. i ask my mom and she goes to ask my dad. she comes back and says ""he wants you back by 11:00."" i thank her for the permission and we proceed to leave my house and go to eat'n'park in monaca.(the time was 9:40) we get there, get our food, eat it, talk with sarah santry for a little bit and leave.(the time was 11:05) on the way home i called to appologize.. i woke up my dad and he just said how pissed he was and hung up. when i got home they were both asleep so i just went to bed. today i talk to my mom after school and she tells me that my dad is still on a tyraid about last night. i had to work 4:30-10:00, so when i got home they were sitting in the living room. i just sat and waiting for the verbal onslaught to commense. and did it ever.. for a good 20 minutes straight my father yelled at me and made me feel like the lowest thing on the planet because i have no responsibilty or respect for them(or anyone for that matter) and that i <b>just don't care.</b> but it's not that i dont <i>care</i>, rather i can't handle stress so i just pass everything off. the responsibility part, though. that made me mad. i've worked at two places in the past year and a half, never been fired and i think that i've been a good worker, and i told my dad that every bit of work ethic i have was instilled by him or my mom throughout my life. i told him that and he just kind of brushed it off and started ranting about how i still don't care about anything and he just went on and on.... and to end it all, he declared i will not be out past 11:00 on any night, no matter who is driving or who i'm with until after thanksgiving.

i just can't win.. i'm not a good son. i don't do anything right, or at least my parents don't notice when i do. they poke and prod at the things i do wrong though, like a festering boil. one day, that boil is going to pop and i'm gonna flip out on them and my dad will probably punch me in the face... let's just hope i move out before that happens. for now, i'll just suck it up and try to keep going on without suffering an extreme mental breakdown...  -xoxo"

"event","i am sick and fucking tired of having a driver's license and a car. i just want to sell my car, cancel my cell phone, quit my job and never leave my house. that way, i can never get in trouble and have to pay any fines or insurance or have to worry about not having to drive anywhere.

honestly, my parents are sticking to their guns about not letting me drive, but i dont think they understand that after my hearing, i'm just going to lose my licnense for 60 days. think about everything from november 5th though january 5th. that's thanksgiving, christmas and new years. not to mention any days off and weekends when i would ever want to go out. they refuse to let me drive anywhere, and they refuse to take me anywhere. so i'm stuck in here by myself, unless bill can come over or one of my other friends can get their parents to drive them to my house and back. which is hard for most parents to do.... my parents are the same way, but don't understand why other parents are too. whatever..... there's nothing i can do.

"event","i haven't really been motivated to post as of late. i recently broke up with lacey, which has me so incredibly down because i didn't want to do it, but i couldn't handle her parents and their bullshit any longer. i miss her, but i don't think we could ever get back together, that is, unless something very drastic changes... and i don't see that happening any time soon. we're still friends, but it's so hard to hold your feelings for someone sometimes...

as for today, it was a fairly fun day. i worked 9-2:30. it wasn't bad, but i was glad to be out of there. i went from work to beaver to pick up abbey.(the parents are letting me drive more lately) i stayed there with kari for a while then abbey and i came back to my house. we hung out for a little bit, then bill came over, we jammed and then went to eat at my cousin's house for his birthday. we came home after the food and watched the breakfast club. i have to say, that is one of my favorite movies ever. bill and i had seen it before, but it was abbey's first time. i think it is safe to say that she enjoyed it. oh, my sister was here this afternoon and she brought back my nes and burnt me a couple new cds. i love her. i miss her alot. i only get to see her like once a month. tomorrow i work 12:30-9:00. i hate that shift so much. it totally ruins my entire day. oh man, we have monday off school. i am sleeping as much as i can.  -xoxo"

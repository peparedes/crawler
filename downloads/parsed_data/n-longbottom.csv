"event","Potions was hell today. Why does Snape insist on degrading me?

One of the Slytherin first years kept eyeing me in the great hall during dinner. You know the look... the one that implies, ""Baby, if you were words on a page, you'd be what they call FINE PRINT!"" or something similar. So you can image how disappointing it was when he walked by with another boy and winked at me on his way out. *Pout*"

So I ran into Colin ...

And first he gets all concerend because the last thing I ate was a bagel yesterday morning.  Aren't my eating habits my business?

And then he proceeds to ask me to the Ball with him and Ginny.

"event","I just broke up with Colin.

I realized that I had just been using him to distance myself from my Gran's death, and that wasn't fair to him.

But I can talk about Gran now.  She died peacefully in her sleep the day we got back from winter hols, and that was the reason I was so off at that time.  I apologize to anyone I snapped at, and to Draco for punching him."

Well, I guess my hols were okay.  **But not much after them was ...** I got a new Herbology text, and a book on Quidditch.  I wish I could play for a house team, but I'm really not good enough.  I mean, I'm actually an okay Keeper, but there's no way I could compete with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~chess_champ"">Ron</a> ...

And I finally figured out how to get noticed without doing something stupid.  All you have to do is wander around the dungeons, and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~slytherindraco"">Malfoy</a> will follow you around like a sad puppy dog.  Even after I told him to stop a few times, and punched him, he continued to follow me.  He's actually quite managable without his cronies around him.

Oh, and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~cameraboy"">Colin</a>?  I know you meant it, and I meant it when I said I would remember."

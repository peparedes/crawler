"event","Although I posted awhile back saying I decided to bring this up now that I can't rely on Branden to fill people in on the events surrounding me (since 1st: he became not my roommate 2nd: I moved to Davenport, IA and 3rd: he's not at USD anymore either) but then never really got around to doing anything with it. Really, I don't imagine that I'll remember to post much now either since classes just started again this past week and I have boards I in September.

For those who don't know, I'm in Davenport, IA attending Palmer College of Chiropractic and just finished my first year here. It sucked... a lot... but it should get better now that I'm away from most of the anatomy and physiology classes and finally into nifty stuff like instrumentation and my first trimester (out of 5) of radiology. Also, this tri is the first one where we actually start learning any techniques. Specifically, toggle recoil (aka Palmer upper cervical; hole in one; etc.). This, of course, being an upper cervical technique and thus will end up being different from the full spine techniques (such as Gonstead and Diversified) that I'll be learning later. Namely the differences are in the listing system (the system to determine misalignments and/or sublixations based on adjacent vertebra) and recoil being part of the technique instead of a hold due to differences in cervical anatomy compared to most of the spine. In addition to the required techniques here I'm thinking of also getting into some cranial work, SOT, and activator (I personally don't like activators, but I know some people greatly prefer it). Also, I think clinic abroad would be a pretty nifty experience later on when I can. Either to India or Fiji (Madagascar and Brazil are two other options out of a small list of them. I can't really remember the others). Finally, I also started self-study Japanese. Probably a bit foolish since I have no time to make progress and there's so much progress that really needs to be made for proficiency, but for now I'm trying. All I really have though are the entire Katakana and Hiragana systems, but no Kanji and as far as vocabulary goes I just have the days of the week, months of the year, 1-10, the four directions, several colors, and a few random basic phrases. Oh well.

As for interesting stuff in my life though, I got a cat. He's named Ranma. Yes, that's after the anime/manga by the way since he was called Becky by the humane society here and marked as an unspayed female. So, of course, in complying with my apartment's regulations, when I went to get him spayed I was informed that he was in fact a neutered male. Fun times. Besides that though, all he does is eat, sleep, shed, look out the window, and is only willing to play for 5 minutes before getting bored. Basically, he's just like me except with a tail, one more leg, and more free time to do his sleeping. It makes me jealous. Fortunately for him (but regrettably for me though) his only real competition for my affection right now is a bamboo plant which I regularly forget to water yet still seems in fine health. I guess I'm just a master (albeit lazy) gardener that way.

More information to come if I successfully pass boards this time around"

Yeah... really not much else to say though.

The most social activity I get involved with is shopping for groceries unless you count talking to peoples for the five minutes between classes. I did manage to make it to my first Reel Big Fish concert awhile back though. It was pretty awesome. Back to studying for now though. C1 - L4 need to be known for my Thursday exam. Fun times..."

Also, I won't have anybody think I planned this before the vote, because I didn't. Instead things happened that made me rethink and reconsider a bit.

However, it shall remain for a limited number of purposes
1. It shall herald any significant returns to Sioux Falls
2. It shall announce the death of Branden (if such a tragedy should occur) just as I would expect his to announce mine
3. It'll still be used for me to look at everybody else's friends only posts (if I'm marked as a friend), so please don't remove me from any such lists unless you really want to.
4. Going along with (3), it shall also be used to post comments (not that I do often anyway)
5. In case I decide to use it again, not only shall I announce it here, I'll also have it ready

Basically, I don't see why it would matter a whole lot anyway since, as room mates, Branden's livejournal should be sufficient to tell all the interesting stories anyway and all you'll really miss out on is how my own classes are going which I don't really post about anyway

Psychology MWF 8am - 8:50am
Composition 2 MWF 9am - 9:50am
Elementary Latin MTWTH 10am - 10:50am
Cellular and molecular biology MWF 11am - 11:50am

Cellular and molecular biology lab W 6pm - 8:50pm

Hate English classes though (comp. II and speech is also included), but I decided for those two more cedits (total) over an advanced chem. class that meets a requirement (both those aforementioned classes are also required). Thankfully, I'm fairly good at bio, so hopefully that'll be fine. As for elementary Latin, it's 101. The 201 and 202 classes are recommended for those who have already had one or two years of high school Latin and considering I ranked among top in the nation both years of high school Latin in national exams, 101 should be slothfully easy. Psychology I've noticed that with only a little bit of any studying, I probably could have gotten out of it anyway. Basically, that lets you know when to call me or when I'll be online since my livejournal may die (except to announce whenever I return to town). Hopefully I'll get a job though and that schedule will be more cluttered. lol

Speaking of that, my current count on the vote is 10 to keep it (since Collison's was more of a minor ramble than a vote either way that was listed) and none to kill it that was posted, but there are some that I know currently show up as no's"

In other news, I completely neglected to take the will of the people into account in my decision to kill off my livejournal. Therefore, I call a vote. Anybody who doesn't vote (based on those who I expect possibly read this at all) automatically count as votes to kill it off (so basically if you want it dead, you don't even have to say anything and thus time is saved. Yay, right?) Vote ends Friday night, of course."

I know this is a sudden decision and one that some people may not be willing to accept, but I'm hoping this will not mean the end of your world. After all, it's not so far as me actually shaving off my soul patch which allegedly some people would kill me if I were to do so. In this time of sorrow at the passing of my saying ""gasp!"" I feel it is only right to begin with a brief story of its life. It all began when I decided my gasps suck and that I'm better at just saying it and it all ended today when I decided ""egads!"" is all good too. The End. The gasp is dead, long live egads!

In all honesty, I'm not sure how long I can go without my gasp, but I'll try."

"event","I have suddenly realized a horrible problem that Branden and I face before heading off to college and that is that neither of us has yet mentioned anything about a can opener. The obvious solution is to simply not have any canned foods. Because meal plans are mandatory, we could just go along with that, but it is far less fun than coming up with our own edibles (that's my opinion, at least). However, we must wonder as to if we can actually survive without the precious canned foods. As some of you may know, the price of canned foods is dropping worldwide as more ranches are opening up to raise them as they graze about in their large herds and newer techniques ensure better health and thus higher volume for each can. I think it goes without saying that cheap food = good for college students. Oh to lead the simple life of the canned food and have little worries in the world, but alas, as the natural predator I am left forced to hunt and kill and eat them instead, but we seem to be lacking in the tools necesarry to open their thick hides: Freakishly sharp teeth and/or can openers. I fear we may starve...

Tom's not only charges more for a relatively sub-par BFR, it also serves it with butter tabs instead of tubs, and I think we all know how of a differance that one letter can make when it comes to butter. They even lacked any pitchers of water and instead gave us bigger glasses and refills is all. Were it not for my younger brother almost deliberatly making it harder on them at the register, Branden and I would have been even more disappointed. Perhaps worst of all was that, despite how crowded it was, we did not notice a single stoner table. It completely lacked all the atmosphere that I have grown to love in Fryn' Pan. In summation, Tom's makes me sad and want to eat at the Fryn' Pan instead.

Also, no offense to Erica for working there. Instead I feel sorry for her... Poor Erica! ::hugs::

"event","So I was eating some chocolate with almonds in there yesterday when I thought, ""You know what some great nuts are? Brazil nuts... and macadamia..."" And then I also thought, ""Why don't people eat more brazil nuts? Are we a culture that's racist against the nuts of Brazil?"" I, myself, love Brazil nuts and macadamia nuts, but does that alone make me biased against other nuts? Should we even distinguish between other nuts? After all, I don't like walnuts as much as other nuts and even if they were all just called nuts, I'd still notice that walnuts look and taste just a bit differant. Sure I don't mind walnuts and I'll eat them in brownies and stuff (especially Collison's special brownies), but I'm not going to go out of my way to eat them, and why should I? I suppose in the end some people just don't like Brazil nuts and some people don't like walnuts. I should just relish in the fact that it leaves more Brazil nuts for me. Would somebody mind buying me some Brazil and/or macadamia nuts? I really want some now...

"event","Yep. I'm pretty sure that my room is haunted or that, at the very least, one of my graduation balloons is. And yes, in case some of you didn't know, I am at least a little superstitious. Anyway, the balloon was positioned at the opposite corner of the room as me (and since I have the largest room in the house even compared to that of my parents, that's no small distance) and then about a minute after I woke up it just kind of hovered over to above my chair (to my left) and floated there for about 5 seconds that floated to just over my desk (almost immediatly to my left). There it sat for about another 5 seconds and then kind of lowered and continued moving closer to me until it shifted to moving in front of my fan. When it got there, it just lunged at me! That it did so wasn't surprising, of course, because the fan was on, but the way it moved to get there was kind of creepy. After that though it just kind of flew around in circles above me rising when moving away from me and falling whenever it came near my face until it floated along my bookshelf at the head of my bed (I moved out of the way a bit not wanting to disturb the balloon) it made one more circle and then rested on the pillow next to mine for a bit before checking out the books above the head of my bed where it got its tail stuck between the wall and a book. It got out, did some more circles, and then got stuck again later where it now remains.

Yeah... it was problably a lot more creepy/entertaining if you actually saw it."

Speaking of which, Mark shall be there apparently, so that's one right there. Yay. So although anybody would be all good (because peoples are generally cool), that would be for the best. And if they aren't, I may wind up dragging them with me into little states of complete relaxation and bliss of their own.

EDIT: Branden shall be there as well. It was only recently that he informed me that he is in fact NOT a pothead. I figured that the way he looked in my bucket hat on Black Friday was just a little too coincidental, but apparently it really was just a coincidence that he looked more like a stoner than most stoners do."

May 28 from 1-3

I don't know if there's really a whole lot more I need to say about that, but then again I'm just about to head off to bed right now, so let me know if I should toss on more info.

"event","Just now found out that of my 12 AP exams (between this year and last year) only 2 are not accepted at USD (and Latin is surprisingly not one of them. lol) so that's pretty good, I think. All of the ones that are accepted at all accept 3s even and any higher in most of them just means out of even more credit hours for higher classes.

Also, Branden and I shall now possess a wok at USD. That way we can make all of the chinese food that we want. Because we make so much, of course... Hopefully there won't be any Mongolians around. ""Darn you Mongolians! Every time we Chinese try to build a wall, you come and break it down!""

And, since I wasn't at school for it, the toast of the day:

I'd like to propose a toast to the Byzantines because you can't go wrong with a culture that was considered one of the last bastions of culture and learning during the medieval dark ages."

"event","First day happened to be my longest day of AP exams (albeit onnly by 20 minutes) and it went surprisingly fine despite not having a class or having done any study for one of the tests (AP World History). All I can say is it's really lucky when the one of three essays you don't have a clue about is a DBQ (answers are handed to you. Just got to know how to use them) another was closely related to American history (Not technically, but I drew a lot of info from it) and the third one you just happen to naturally know about it really well. Yeah for having not been anywhere near specific enough on any of those (since I'm not allowed to), but at least you get the idea.

Also, the toast of the day:

I'd like to propose a toast to the Turks because you can't go wrong with a culture who's major positions for slaves were primarily military service and government positions."

Five pages of vocab that I'm especially unsure about from the Latin 1 book alone. 1.5 are from the first half leaving the remaining 3.5 from the other... the lack of balance in those numbers is disturbing... I'm almost afraid to start the second book now. Oh well. I still will when I don't feel too lazy to study (which will hopfully be really soon. lol)"

Yep. Not a whole lot going on except for maybe some neopets, movies that my brother is getting (since he's been home recently. He left today) and studying for AP tests. Speaking of which, I found out that I probably wouldn't be able to pass the Latin: Vergil exam without at least Latin 4. However, I guess even right after signing up for it I didn't think I'd pass. I'll probably take it anyway. However, certain peoples have gotten my hopes up for the psych test, so that may be good. In the end though, my least favorite part out of all nine exams this year is going to be that I have to do another DBQ. I hate those things so much. lol Oh well. It's all good (kind of)

By the way, I learned today thanks to Mark and Branden that hitting a guy with a bicycle over 3000 meters and a max of 91 meters in the air is really hilarious and more than just a little fun. And there's physics involved, too. lol"

The only injuries sustained by the loser in this fight were two ears chewed off, one eye bursted and the other disabled, right cheek bone caved in, bridge of the nose broken, seven teeth knocked out, one jaw bone mashed, one side of the tongue chewed off, and several other unimportant fractures and bruises. Red retires from the ring in disgust.""

And people complained about Mike Tyson! What weaklings we are nowadays! By the way, his eye was hanging out and jaw out of place by the 42nd round already, but he decided to fight on anyway (rules didn't allow for R&R. Not even to pop an eye back in its socket)."

"event","Last Night I went to the movies with Becca and Laura and Ali to see ""28 Days Later"" it was really good. It was unrealistic but, I think it was original and scary 2. We went 4 ice cream and stuff later and just chilled for like an hour. Then today Amanda came  to food pantry with Ali and me and ali had to leave 4 work so Amanda nad Me went to go see ""Freddy vs. Jason"" with becca,laura, and hayley. It was so freakin dumb and it wasnt that scary. A few parts were good. And tonight we r going to see ""League of Extordsinary Gentleman "" at the cheap theater. B/c We have seen everything else. 

Tomorrow Ali was supposed to go to a Dave Mathews concert with jules and sarah but, she has to work so im gonna go instead.

"event","Myrtle Beach was awesome. I went with my dad, my sisters, my aunt, uncle, and my 2 cousins. I was there from august 16 to the 23. Doodles and I went down a day earlier with my aunt and her crew  b/c my dads car would of been to squished.

The thing i luv most about myrtle is u step out of ur hotel lobby and a few yards away is a pool, with a little beach bar and grill, and then there are sum steps and ur on the beach. It's great and the hotel is awesome it has a whole kitchen and bedrooms. so sum nights u can stay on the beach longer and u can eat dinner in . The hotel we stay at is its own hotel/Condo's but, u go through a company called the ""Caravbelle"" to rent the room b/c ppl own each room. But, there are 6 other hotels that are part of the ""Caravelle"" so u get to use all those pools and things offered in at that hotel. So that was fun going in the ocean and then going straight to a pool. And if u wanted to go to ur room b/c u forgot sumthing it was right there for u.

The waves there are incredible as well. They knock u right over. And the beaches up here dont have like that nice sand lol. The sand there is hot but, it is all sand there are no rocks or anything in it. The only place there are little baby rocks and a few shells is as soon as u walk in the water and they are very minor like if u walk on them they dont hurt, buty i learned that if u fall hard on them u get wounded. lmao. I was boarding and the wave brought me close to the shore and i stood up and i was walking back out and all of a sudden i lost my balance b/c of another wave and in front of tons of ppl i fall like a dumb ass and cut the top of my thigh kinda near my hip . And it was bleeding and it really hurt. So my cousin and i went up to the lifeguard, and i showed him and i was like do u have a bandage and hes like ""NAH got nuttin like that"" with a little southern accent. lol He was cute but, I mean he didnt even have a 1st aid kit and hes a lifeguard. lol. 

The whole week we (sisters and i ) notice this french speaking family from Canada thAT was there last year as well. And we wanted to talk to them so bad b/c there was a 14 yr old boy, 13 yr old boy, 8 yr old boy, and a 6 yr old girl. We thought we could practice sum french, but we learned from Allison (meeting the 13 yr-old one in the water) that him and his older brother know english well, and the little ones are just learning.So on our last day we were determined to become friends, b/c the boys were so Hot and they seemed fun lol. And it happened we were with the little two all day talking in french, in a little english and it really was funny and cool. So the next day they were leaving early i nthe morning and so were we, and i lookedo ut on the balcony and i couldnt see their car so I was kinda sad b/c we didnt even get to say bye. But, as amanda and ali were going down in the elevator the oldest boy got in as well. It was great, b/c we got to say goodbye and all this stuff lol. So i walk out and the oldest, 3rd youngest, and the youngest are there in the lobby and they are talking to me and the whole time in my head I'm like ""Iluv this family"". So a few minutes b4 they drove away their mom gave us their number, address, and the oldest boys email address lol. The mother told me I could come to Canada and visit them. 

It was just a great trip and when I got home, I couldnt believe how much reality was setting in. Especially b/c of school and summer reading. I only finsished one book and i have done 2 chapters in the second book! o well lol.

well g2g ttyl!"

Then there were these 2 really funny kids that were on the last ride with us and they were making us shout things, it was funny.

                      Why Don't You And I


Since the moment I spotted you 
Like walking around with little wings on my shoes 
My stomach's filled with the butterflies...and it's alright 
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud 
I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down 
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied 

Pre-Chorus 
Everytime I try to talk to you 
I get tongue-tied 
Turns Out everything I say to you 
Comes out wrong and never comes out right 

Chorus 
So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever 
Heads we will and tails we'll try again 
So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven 
Cause without you they're never going to let me in 
And slowly I begin to realize this is never going to end 
Right about the same you walk by 
And I say 'Oh here we go again' 

When's this ever going to break? 
I think I've handled more than any man can take 
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around 
And it's alright 
Bouncing round from cloud to cloud 
I got the feeling like I'm never going to come down 
If I said I didn't like it then you know I'd lied 

Pre Chorus - repeat

"event","Golf can be a very boring sport. There was this tounrament at the Fall River Country Club for this man that went to Connolly and he died in a car accident. I was asked to do it and I didnt mind really. All we had to do was sit at the assigned hole and ask for $2.00 donations. Even though Golf is boring, I think it is a really great thing that the family has in honor. A few kids were there that I really knew. We brought Kristen and she stayed with amanda at (whatever hole they had) while ali and I were at hole #8. It was the biggest golf course ever. It was really pretty. Each hole was like so far away from eachother. like u would think that 3 was next to 4 but, it wasnt at all. THis old guy on one of the golf carts picked us up at the main building at 8 and drove us over to our spot. and he picked us up at 12:45 when the tournament was over. He was so old and cute lol. 
Thank God it wasn't sunny out b/c where ali and i were we would of been torched. 

Anyway...going to a party on Friday Night. Surprise party! lol its gonna be cool, i havent seen my SARWAH in awhile.I just dont want to blow my weight watchers when I go. B/c at parties..its hard to resist all the good food lol. B/c I definatly blew it on 4th of July.But, I actually have been really good with eating only my points. Sumtimes I add points for things I didnt eat b/c i just want to be ahead of myself and not even eat as much as I should. That sounds stupid but, I feel better. I excercise and stuff so hopefully it will work out. OBVIOUSLY no diet in my life has ever worked so I really want this to work more then anything. I want to look at least a lil bit decent in my bathing suit this year at Myrtle Beach or any beach for that matter. lol. No one is gonna be looking but just for my sanity........

 My second day of doing this was so tough for sum reason. Like I used all my points up by like 3:00 b/c I was out and I was wicked hungry. And I came home and fell asleep for an hour and half. I woke up with pains and puked everywhere. And I didnt even feel sick afterwards at all. So I cut the number of points i had that day in half and just ate zero points for the rest of the day. it all works out!
 Well this is probably boring to all of ya'll b/c it is kinda boring  so I'm gonna go. Ill ttyl!"

"event","I went to Kristens today! It was fun, she braided our hair and we just kinda chilled. Her cousins were so funny. HE is 13 but, he was fun. Luv ya Kristen!I kinda experimented on my mom and sister to see if i knew how to braid the cornrows in their hair and it actually came out pretty good. I am just real slow at it.lol.

My feet and abs are so sore from working out everyday. This diet is a killer! Its excercise and eating right.I really want to stick with it though. I usually dont but, this summer I want to loose a good amount so sticking with it is the only way. And to me its not all about being the perfect weight Its also me wanting to be in good shape for the fall. I think I want to either play feild hockey or volleyball, Im not sure yet....................

It dosent even feel like summer and I hate it. I think once 4th of July happens maybe it will begin to feel a little more like it!"

"event","Today I had the most boring day. I did yard work for most of the day and in between I would watch USA Network. lol. What a life huh? They had some pretty good movies on though! I mean I dont mind helping out with yard work but, it just really wears me out! 

Anyway....
 There was food pantry on Saturday and I almost forgot to go. I remembered at midnight on Friday night lol. There wasn't that many Connolly students but, quite a few people came. This is gonna sound horrible but, this old man came in and he was so scary. He looked creepy and he had a shirt that said something like 15% nice and 85% NASTY. It gets nastier. lol Julie, Ali, and I were handing out bags and he walks over, takes the bag from my hand and then he  stands there next to us. He says ""You three girls are great looking, just what I want"", then he said ""I wish I could take you home. Can I take ya home?"". And i almost shit my pants lol. So he goes and eats his donuts and comes back and says sum more stuff. He says it again how he wants to take us home and how he likes us. And we were just like BYE. I got so nervous. I feel bad for a lot of those people  but, then some I just don't feel bad for."

   4th of July is coming up which hopefully will be really cool. I am leaving the 3rd and will be back on the July 7th. We are going to Connecticut to see my dad and family. Katie,Jimmy,and Amy will be there so it will be even better lol!Our cousin is having her anual 4th of July party which is always pretty good. Its just A bunch of family and the best Italian food .lol.   
   We went to the mall tonight and just walked around and  amanda bought shit for like 2 1/2 hours. We shopped while Ali was working! I bought this cute skirt from Old Navy that Im gonna wear on the 4th. Then we went upstairs and I beat amanda at race cars! There was nothing to really do tonight because no one was around and I am broke. The only thing I had was my gift cards. But we got to see Charlies Angels 2 yesterday. It was so funny! Then we went to the cheap theatre in East Providence and saw ""Holes"". It was better then I thought it was going to be.

Im really tired and all I am doing is rambling so G-NIGHT!"

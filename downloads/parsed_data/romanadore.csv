"event","I gulped down the last of my celebratory champagne and welcomed in the New Year. 2009 and I parted ways as I patiently awaited 2010 to slowly set in. If things didn't immediately click, I had the whole year to get used to it. My eyes stung from the smoke accumulating at the bar. I could have sworn they were fumigating the place by the look of the haze building around me. Perhaps it was the emotion taking me over that made my eyes water, not the toxins in the air. I reflected on my past year and realized that this year very differently from where I currently found myself. I was in a house full of friends. Blissful, drunken beings, dancing and singing as the clock struck twelve. I was young, naive, helpless to the things around me, but my innocence made me happy. There was no danger other than the ones present outside of the front door. And now the year ended with what would begin my new year; A bar full of strangers. Blissful, drunken beings, dancing and singing as the clock struck twelve.

This time, however, I nervously awaited the toll of the clock. I knew that for the first time ever in my life I would get my midnight kiss; the one I've waited for in my whole life. Not for the reason because it meant that I had someone. I've always had someone. Things were different this time. I didn't have someone, I had him. He wasn't just anyone, he was THE one. The one that struck down my guard and built his nest in my heart. His nest grew into a house which is now his permanent home. No eviction nor foreclosure could penetrate the walls he built within me.

Why bring all this up? Well last year I found comfort in the barricades of people that I surrounded myself with but now I've found the comfort of being independent in this world and I've found comfort in the man that I love. I know that I am safe in his heart and that this year will be an amazing one, especially with him by my side. Chris, I love you. Thank you for making all of this possible.


Happy New Year to all of you/"

Have you ever felt like you have been in one of those moments most easily described as ""being surrounded in a crowded room yet feeling completely alienated, almost outcasted."" Well I kind of feel that. I've felt like that for a while. Don't take pity on me though, I'm used to matters such as these.

"event","I've grown tired of my writing style.

A few months ago, nearly a year ago to be precise, I found what I called my ""writing voice."" I was ecstatic with what I had discovered because I finally felt like I had a style of writing to suit my life, my personality and the way I felt. Now, I feel I have either lost it or I've grown tired of it. I look over the things I write and they bore me. My own words bore me. From page to page nothing seems to change. Perhaps I'm truly becoming a writer and my greatest critic. 

The only piece I am proud of at the moment is a song that I've been working on titled ""Alphabet Soup."" The song pretty much is a reflection on how life sometimes just isn't the way you would hope for it to turn out. Here's part of the chorus:

""<i>My life isn't grey, just a light shade of blue.
I've got nothing but numbers in my alphabet soup.
And I know that life may end real soon
But for now I think I'll sleep until noon.</i>""

To say the least my writing may just be a direct product of my life which as of late has been just as stagnant, a bit unspectacular with days filled with an abundance of repetitions from days of past. Aside from going shopping a few days ago, the only engaging thing I've done for the past week now has been playing Pokemon. Don't get me wrong, I love the game but I can really only play for so long. I need a vacation, an adventure, a high-speed car-chase getaway onto a cruise ship sweepstakes win!  I need something to sharpen this dull life of mine and it definitely needs to be something other than spontaneously getting drunk or high in the middle of the week.

My life doesn't feel the way it probably should; I think that's why I haven't updated in a while.

""Love Conquers All,""
Whatever that's supposed to mean.
I ask, ""If love conquers, does it consume?
Does it devour and destroy?""
Of course it does, otherwise it wouldn't be a good thing
Without a bad.
It's time we take a hit of Love;
Because everybody's doing it.

I took a drive Sunday night,
Hoping to gain pleasure by pleasing another
(As I have many times before).
I found myself lost in an unfamiliar city,
100 miles on the wrong road,
Headed in the wrong direction.
When no one answered my call,
I knew it wasn't meant to be.
I had to find my way back home. 

Somewhere in the beginning of this week
I took my pencil and began to draw.
I designed a new thought, 
A desire for something more.
I made a garment embroidered with complexity,
Enveloped in valor,
And embellished with felicity.
My pen took over and began to write
The lyrics to a life revisited,
Refurbished,
Refurnished.

From now on I will pave my owns roads.
A.V.O. is a dream come true."

 - I met and dated a boy for a month, it was alright, nothing too crazy. I broke things off with him because I didn't really see them going anywhere.

 - I went to Halloween Horror Nights and Magic Kingdom the weeekend of Oct. 24 for the first time. Hands down it was incredible and my best weekend ever. I'm already planning another trip up.

 - One of my brothers from Nicaragua passed away last sunday. He had been battling cancer for a few months. My family has been grieving as I have too but I didn't really know the guy. Sorry =\

 - I've done my usual share of drunken debauchery and devious nights but my best drunken night had to be this past weekend: A bottle of Skyy, Patron, Parrot Bay Passion Fruit and Jaggermeister, all downed by 3 am, people knocking out left and right, puking, laughing, yelling. Ended up at IHOP and in bed with a boy I just met.

 - I've become so much more comfortable with having sex it's ridiculous.

 - I have yet to have a night comparible to February 9th with the white hulks or May 24 with the Red Rolls-Royce at Gemini. What a fucking buzz-kill.

 - I've been doing better this semester though I missed a midterm on monday and my professor is being a bitch about letting me make it up.

 - These past couple of days I've found myself searching for inspiration because I haven't drawn or written much these past few months. I am definitely in need of a spark to turn my brain on.

Autumn Music Festival is on November 22 and Robbie Rivera is set to headline. Ultra Tickets go on sale soon enough. I can't fucking wait. I'll be keeping in touch.

"event","Trouble is knocking on my door again. Well, he's actually been calling and text messaging my cellphone, but I don't know why. A friend tells me it's because his social life has gone to the social shit-hole. That may very well be the case though I'm sure he is also looking to make amends. Whichever the ocassion, I know to remain at a distance. Two times of tries each ending in a horrible argument which has led us to not speak for weeks, even months, is enough to assume that a third time probably won't go well either. I'll wait and see what ""trouble"" thinks.


I've caught myself daydreaming on several ocassions over these past few days. Each time I catch myself thinking about a boy that I get to see regularly but not frequently. I'm only given the opportunity to quiver in his presence while our mutual friends are around us. I'm always stealing quick glances, perhaps staring without the notice of others not even said boy. Why do I continue to linger on with mere fantasies as opposed to actually making a move? Well two hurdles lie before me: one being an unmentionable personal choice in how he lives his life and the second being the respect I hold in regards to his choice. So I kind of like a boy, no big deal, but I can't help but be a bit confused as to why it is that I gravitate towards him. I don't know why. Well he is attractive and does have an outgoing personality but I know something else lies to be discovered. Perhaps it is the mystery that intrigues me.

Since I arrived back in Miami from my vacation to Nicaragua a lot of things have occurred. I've made several adjustments on how I live my life. I've been spending numberless and incredible days with my friends, each day followed by its own night of mayhem. Though it was rough getting back into the usual routine of attending classes and going to work, I am thoroughly satisfied with my schedule this semester, the courses I am enrolled in and the amount of hours I've been making; which in all is great because most of the stresses I've had to deal with have been lifted off of my back and has allowed me to concentrate on more important, as well as insignificant, things. The only department I seem to be dragging long in is my love-life. I seem to be lacking that companionship and affection that a only boyfriend can offer me. 

I have high hopes for the next couple of months. I swear that my optimism may one day be the death of me but what to do? I refuse to sulk. It would seem that all the citizens of Romany are in a friendly-type mood despite the rainy weather.

Though it turns out I am the only one to leave and come back, is it terrible to want to be one of those to not return? Is it completely horrible to admit that I envy those gone to make their lives anew just a bit? I admit it now that much has come into perspective and I can't help but want something new, something more.

Then again I am one of those to go back to Miami to face my problems to fix them as opposed to leaving everything behind possibly even without a second chance or word. I am fortunate enough to have a chance at retribution.

I suppose I'll return to build on my foundations until I'm capable of building that tall skyscraper to reach the sky and look down upon the rest of the world.

"event","I feel like it has been ages since I last sat down to write, or type in this matter, about occurrances or thoughts taking place in my life. It has been a while so I do apologize if my diction is a bit off.


On June 13, 2008 my best friend Carlos Eduardo Moreno Vargas received a letter in the mail. It was his final deportation notice. After being in the country for nearly six years it would seem that he has reached the end of his rope. After working a few things out with his family's lawyer there is some hope for him to remain in the country for a few more months but that's pretty much where his life in the United States ends. Luckily his future doesn't seem bleak at all. He's going to finish taking the necessary courses he iss missing in order to receive his A.A. and then he will be off to live in Spain and to cotinue his collegiate education in a school possibly more prestigious than any in the United States. However much I know it will kill me once he is gone we will try our hardest to keep in contact and remain as a permanent part of each other's lives. More than anything else I'm just happy to know that he could very well be better off living his life in Spain as opposed to continuing his life in Miami.

I chose to begin writing with the above statement because the thought of Carlos leaving has been in the back of my mind all summer. We joke around about it every once in a while and as I said I am beyond excited for him but the truth of the matter is that to some extent I'm not exactly sure what to do when he leaves. Obviously I know that life goes on and such but damn it feels as though four years of history is coming to a stagnant halt.

Sadly, he isn't the only person leaving. On August 1, 2008 my other best friend Alexis Salas is moving up to Ohio, though his migration is due to his own personal reasons. So another person that I have come to spend a great deal of time with during these past years is packing up his bags and leaving to continue his life elsewhere. These two boys can't begin to imagine how they've helped me steer my life down the path it's taken so far. However I have no doubts that I will see them again whenever time and life itself allow them to come back, even if just for a few days' visit. This summer will also see the departure of such friends as Justin and Gabby who may not have had as great of a significant importance in my life as Carlos or Alexis, but have certainly come to make this summer worth remembering. Then there are the people that I've only known for a short amount of time this year but will continue to make my days bearable once everyone has gone.

Together all of my friends have come to mean the world to me and have graced the pages of my life's story with moments spent dancing, laughing, getting unbearably wasted after a night filled with jaggerbombs and rounds of flip-cup, surviving the scabies epidemic, crying in each other's arms, tagging each other in pictures of us making grotesque poses and faces on Facebook, rolling on the floor laughing, getting high and making egg drop soup, stuffing ourselves with peanut butter and oreos, sending text messages as the clock struck 11:11, getting completely covered in glow paint and cringing from the burn of it when it gets into your eye, being cheered on as I did my pseudo techtonik dancing in the crowds of Vagabond and Discotekka, making french toast for breakfast on my days off, running off the beach with bottles of vodka at the sight of flashing blue and red lights, watching So You Think can Dance, running through the halls of hotels in Daytona, giving hugs to bums to only end up rejected, yelling ""Tenui"", playing Final Fantasy, singing ""Show Me Love"" by Mobin Master to only receive flashbacks of Gemini Music Festival, eating IHOP at 4 in the morning completely drunk, rolling fucking balls but then wanting it to stop once you realize it's  9 in the morning and you still can't see straight, sharing stories like these and other amazing moments that I can't thoroughly remember that make up the haze known as the summer of 2008.

Now on to my departure. I leave for Nicaragua tomorrow morning at 5 AM. I'm only leaving for eighteen days, however I feel that it marks the beginning of the string of departures to come. Although I will only be gone for a short time, the same people won't be here when I get back. Whether we stay or go we are all going to change one way or another, for better or for worse. I know that I myself am in store for my own changes while on my trip. I believe this summer marks the transition from my teen years into adulthood. Either way these memories will continue to live on in my heart. So from this moment on I am letting go of all negative feelings and bad memories that I've come to have so far and will only retain the good ones. As will my backyard and pool :)


This is the summer of 2008. Wish me a safe trip back home.

As of the 6th Frankie and I have been on speaking terms again. I guess I was lying to myself when I said that I no longer wanted to have him in my life. Regardless I'd be lying to myself if I said that I didn't miss him and that I'm not happy to have him back in my life. Though he proved horrible at being stable with his emotions, he remains to be a good friend. There's something to say about that though there is still a lot I'm unsure of.

I'm excited for tomorrow since I'll be attending Gemini Music Festival. It's the first event of its kind that I will be going to which has had me on the edge of anticipation for the past month. I don't know what it will bring but I can only hope good things will come of it.

Speaking of, I've spoken to my friend Phil who as well is an aspiring DJ. We plan on getting together sometime soon so he can teach me a few ""tricks of the trade."" He seems to be all for it actually. I guess he likes the idea of having a protege/apprentice. Hah. Even so I have no possible facade that can mask my eagerness. I'm so fucking stoked.

Last, but certainly not least, I've got two weeks to plan my damned birthday party. What the fuck am I going to do?


Presently, it would seem that my uncertainty is the most comforting thing I own; I'm glad I do.

To be sealed with a kiss

For a while
Before things become vile
As happiness
Brings sadness
And concedes their true madness.

Is a must
When their novelty rusts,
For Joy
Will employ
Some problems to annoy.

They'll shout
Over bouts
But not live without

And make peace under covers.

Though destined to be doomed,
For Love

""Are You sure?""
""...No.""
""Fuck it."" And that he did.

That had to have been the most awkward seven seconds spent arguing with his conscience. Filled with doubt he took the plunge, taken over momentarily by a mild disinhibitor. He pulled his head back, opened his eyes and looked at the face gazing upon him.

""How did it feel?""
""Not quite right.""
""Yeah.""

It was an unspoken agreement reached by two pairs of almond colored eyes.

He made the promise again though it would seem promises said to himself are the only ones he ever bothered to break. The night went on with happiness emanating from the tips of white headphones as flashing lights of blue and white burned into his retinas.  ""Enjoy it while it lasts as life continues to come fast.""

Thanks to that little green pill he was able to ignite joy under stars tonight, daunting any natural cold evils.

""How can you be so sure of yourself?""
""Well it's not a matter of knowing but one of doing.""
""What do you do?""
""I just dance.""

"event","Today (yesterday) is (was) April 15, 2008.

Two years ago today (yesterday) I met a boy that I had no idea would come to have a great impact on my life. This boy's name is Jose Miguel Ceballos. I met him at my friend Valeria's annual spring break party. I had no idea who this kid was nor did I care to get to know him. My first impression of him was actually a terrible one. Either way, I  didn't think I would ever see him again. Yet two weeks later he was my boyfriend. Two month's later he was my ex. Now that two years have passed, though he has been in and out of my life on several occasions, a part of him still resides with me. I think I can even get away with saying that I've thought of him for every single day since I met him, for better or for worse. I still hold him dear to me. I wouldn't call it ""Love."" I wouldn't give it a label for fear of doing injustice to it. Frankly, I don't care what it is nor do I want to find a meaning or reason for it. I just know that it's the truth and it is there. I will leave it as such.

Now this isn't about Jose. This is about my perpetual present (however redundant that may be). This is about all the people that have come to change my life in one way or another. This is about my life.

I met Carlos Roberto Arana (you can call him KuKuMei) on April 17, 2004 at Elisabeth Skipp's (Skippy) house. That is two day's from today. That's four years of history with this kid. I met Carlos Eduardo Moreno on December 17, 2004 though we were friends online at least 8 months prior to meeting him that day at Kaffe Krystale. Alexis Salas and I hung out for the first time on August 6, 2005. We ate at Sushi Maki and had the one conversation that has completely defined our friendship to this day. Sasha Marin and I became friends through MySpace and had our first phone conversation on June 23, 2005. I met her on August 13, 2005 along with Santiago Borges at Dolphin Mall. I remember these dates because these are dates and people that I cared to remember; I knew that one day they would mean something to me, however big or small.

Now there are people such as Fadiah Sarah Drouillard, Katya Gabriella Marion, Nicole Acosta, Alexander Chi, Nadia Kuscevic, Lauren Nicole Coy, Laurin Elise Jones, Alexander Damian Garcia, Gregory Gonzalez, Yoel Orlando Moreno, Justin Barton, Ashley Fernandez, Melanie Scull, Alexander Joseph Russo, Katherine Moreno, Chrisina Joshelyn Machado (she's going to kill me for butchering her name), Andrew Pego, Alexis Puentes, Denise Puente, Denise Bloom, Edgar Fernandez, James Russell Mackenzie, Mary Herrera, Benedict Charles Lawson, Uriel Morales, Yariel Diaz, Eric Andrew Darpini, all of my brothers in Delta Lambda Phi, and so many others that I can't for the life of me remember when it is that we met but for some reason or another, good or bad, they had some affect on my life that has made me into the person that I am today. It goes to show you how you'll come across a plethora of people in your lifetime and not know what they'll mean to you one day. 

On January 5, 2008 I met a boy named Ramon Antonio Rivera. On January 26, 2008 I met a boy named Frank Santino Taboas. I dated both these boys within the past three months. Frankie is no longer in my life while Ray still is, for the most part.  It makes you wonder what makes people stay and what makes them leave. Ray has already had quite the notable impact on me. Now I question how deep the severity of this marred experience will run. I look back on my time with Jose and I never would have thought that experience would change me so much. It all just makes you wonder. Either way I could never be happier with the way my life has turned out thus far. I'll just have to see how it goes.

As a minor update, I am doing amazingly well right now. I'm currently working towards a lot of goals and ambitions that will sculpt  my future. I don't think I have ever been more excited for my future before.

I will leave you all with this: don't under-appreciate anyone. Love them and care for them like it's your last day. You never know what they will come to do for you in your life or how quickly they may leave.

"event","A brief update on my day:
I woke up at around 7:45 or so. Went into a state of swaking only to lift my ass out of bed and toss myself into a cold shower minutes before 8:30. Carlos hadn't called me to wake me up as I had asked him. Got out of the shower, looked at myself in the mirror and thought ""Damn I look good."" I glanced at my phone for any text messages or missed calls. I had a missed call from Carlos at 9:01 A.M. I called him back. 

""Some wake up call; you're late.""
""Sorry! I forgot..."" he replied in his high-pitched, childlike voice.

I returned to my usual morning routine of getting ready for school. I left my house around 9:45, pumped gas and got to F.I.U. at around 10:15. I met up with Carlos and Chino. We hung out in the piano room. I spent most of my time looking up music to whet my interest as I was ignoring Carlos's usual rants about Justin and other such people I could care less about in this world because all they seem to offer is, you guessed it, insipid drama. I went to my Social Psychology class at 12:30 and continued my exploration of any new house/electro/dance music that I would undoubtably come to love. 

I left F.I.U. at 2:00 and arrived at work at 2:30. Work was slack as it usually is. I decided to take off at 6:00 because I was bored out of my mind. Though I was actually entertaining myself by reading past journal entries from my old LiveJournal and GreatestJournal. Damn have I changed and remained the same. I fucking love it. I got home around 7:00. I ate dinner and watched an episode of Lost. That show fucking rocks.

I left my house around 8:15 to head back out to F.I.U. for my usual 9:00 P.M. Chapter meeting. I fucking love my brothers. We spent so much time just talking, joking, ragging on each other and being huge drag queens that we barely got anything serious done. The humor added definite appreciation for the day and for them. Chapter ended around 10:30. After that I drove over to Sasha's grandmother's house where she and Eric were watching TV with her uncle. We spent time eating shit to say the least. (By the way, eat shit more often, it's the best fucking thing you can do to just indulge in everyday life).

I left her house at 11:57 P.M. Now I sit in front of Xero updating my livejournal. Bangin'.

Now on to my mood:
I'm back to a familiar place where only I make sense. With this, I only want ""me"" to make sense. It has been a few months since I last felt like myself, truly like myself. I am content, satisfied and undeniably happy with my life at this moment. I have slowly stripped away the excess and only have my pure necessities at my disposal. Today had to have been one of the best days that I have dedicated to myself in the longest time. Honestly, it was amazing. While searching for music I realized that I was taking the first step in fulfilling my aspiration of getting a better grasp on the electronic/rave scene across the nation and specifically Miami. I almost regret not going to Ultra this year but can't because it has fueled me with the passion to go next year. This is the third year that I have missed it in a row. No way in hell will I miss out on it again. I'll drive my ass there and spend two days alone if I have to. At this point I know the experience will do nothing but change my life and catapult me into a deeper realm of desires and dedication. I know now what it is that I have to search for. I'm done with superfluous. I only need me. 

I am back down to zero. No one is here with me and I've never felt more comfortable in solitude. I've made my mistakes and have learned my lessons. It's time to climb the graph again and shoot for the stars.

Pardon my arrogance but I have never been happier to not be anyone else but myself.

"event","It's taken me a few days to write in here again for the sake of making sure that I'm comfortable and stable with what I'd like to write about. In other words, I've thought over plenty of things so nothing is misunderstood or to avoid saying something only to have my emotions change within minutes of expressing it. Another reason is because updating from my sidekick can be rather tedious. Now I will be updating from my new MacBook, Xero :) I'll probably be switching around between topics. Bare with me. On to my entry.


Ray and I broke up last tuesday, the 25th at 8:44 P.M. I think I found Eight's significance. As a cause of it I took a ride on an emotional roller coaster. Don't close your window yet, let me explain. The first three days or so afterwards were fine. I was pleased with how the relationship went, complied with the break-up (obviously), did my best to distract myself and pick up on anything that wasn't quite right in my life. This all happened in a matter of days. It turns out that we actually have more time at our disposal than what we think.

Friday night I rolled with Carlos, Chi and Nicole. Things were going well at first but somethings were said and expressed that made me think about anything I had been suppressing. I think for the first time ever I crashed while/after rolling. I actually became depressed for a few moment's time after everyone went home. I wrote a poem at nine in the morning to help relieve myself. It indeed did help me to feel better after writing. The next few days went by smoothly.

I think yesterday is what truly brought clarity to my mind though. I hung out with Paris during my break and we spoke a lot about the things on my mind. Then when I got out of work I met up with Alexis and Laurin. We hung out at Sunset Place for a bit. Then they literally kidnapped me and took me to Halouver beach. Once more this  helped to lighten my troubled mind.

I woke up this morning (being wednesday) feeling rather positive. I felt like myself again. The self without a boyfriend that is. Don't get me wrong, that's not bad at all. I just feel like a different person emotionally with and without someone. Anyway I saw Ray tonight. I went to hang out at his house for a bit. It was definitely something different. I felt that there was a bit of a disconnection between us. It's understandable. On my part I can't help but question who I am around him. ""Which sides are worth showing? Which words are suitable for the conversation? Am I sounding friendly or am I coming off cold? Is he sitting too close to me? I think I'm too quiet. Maybe I should say something. I hope I don't look uncomfortable."" A barrage of them in the matter of a few minutes. It is definitely something easier said than done. Staying friends that is. But if there is anything that I am certain about it's that I do want to remain his friend. Not even because I promised I would but because I want to. I practically need it. I need to feel my connection with him because it's one of the few things that I've come to know as being real in my surreal life.

Now on to another topic. It's actually one I've come to find as being rather ironic. A friend of mine asked me for some relationship advice (that's not the irony) today. He was talking about how he's not too happy with his boyfriend because they want different things, etc. Basically the same bullshit as usual, just a different smell. Anyway, when our conversation was coming to an end he told me ""Wow, Roman. You're such a great friend. You're such a good guy. Why can't I find someone like you? I mean you know what you want out of life. You have a great personality. Whoever gets with you will be really lucky. There should be more guys like you."" Now on to the irony. I've heard things like that a countless amount of times. So many guys have told me variations of that. At first I took them as compliments but at this point I almost feel insulted. I mean how many guys have I gone out with, dated or even shown interest in only to be hurt, let down or tossed away by them. But the truth is that it's something purely situational. You can spend your entire life searching for something, wanting it with every fiber of your body and then when you eventually get it you wonder what value it truly has to you. Is it even what you wanted to begin with? Now that you have it, what do you do? It's great, it's perfect but what the fuck do you do with it now? I don't know. I can say one thing for sure though: I think Ray is the first to ever really appreciate me for all that I was and for all that we had. And for that I am grateful.

I really don't know where else to go with this. Give me another week to think.

"event","I suffer from anticipation&nbsp;
Caused by an anxious seperation.
With this stimulation
I am head over heels in adoration,
A&nbsp;stipulation of infatuations
Without limitations,
Like constellations,
Brought on by appreciation
For past tribulations,
Once an isolation,
Which leads to this personification
Of an&nbsp;orgasmic ejaculation
And other like sensations
Fueled by my admiration
Made possible by predestination.

"event","I feel that I have been apart for far too long. I come with great news however. In the time of my absence I have come to learn and discover a great deal of lessons.You all can only begin to imagine what&nbsp;has happened since I last took the time to update this journal. Let us see: 


I was basically depressed all the way through to December. It was soon after my initiation that I finally came to find my old optimistic self. The road that I strayed through was too terrible to ever mention again. I felt like I had just lost track of everything in my life. I had no&nbsp;perception of time, place, beauty, feeling, trust, or love.&nbsp;It was not until after my initiation as a fraternity member that I took a step out of my cold and timid choke-hold from happiness into the light. I am not exactly sure as to what was said to me or what exactly happened but I just knew that at that moment I needed to be myself again. I had lost the dearest and most beloved person in my life to a manic depressive fiend of hatred. 

After that I went back to my usual days of partying, laughing with my friends, and just enjoying life altogether. Somewhere along the way I came to experience something grand: I fell back in love with being in love and the simple love for loving the world. It was something that I hadn't felt since I was a freshman. After being led on by Alexis back in junior year&nbsp;I set up various barriers and restraints to keep me from ever getting hurt again and in that I began to lose all hope for ever learning to truly love someone. Then with Jose, all of my efforts were utterly futile and destined to doomed. This was another blow that would prove to leave me stagnant for months to come. What brought on my internal change was a combination of thoughts, feelings, people, turn of events and life changing experiences. I choose not to delve too much into this subject because I've done so many times before, but I will say this, I am grateful for the boy who allowed me this opportunity to take a chance and taught me to take risks again. Though this change in fact was brought on by my own personal decision making,he as part of the formula led to the final product. His name is Frankie. He was a firecracker, a flame, a catalyst, if you will, which helped to shed light on something I had forgotten about&nbsp; long ago.&nbsp;I am glad to say that&nbsp;my past now rests in the past and my future awaits my arrival. 

Now what I have learned from that time to this&nbsp;point in my life&nbsp;has come to find me with a boy. This is About A Boy, a boy that shares many things with me aside from the initials we bare. I feel that I can't even come to describe our current state for fear of not doing it justice. He is impeccable in his charm, unmatched by his wit, eloquent with diction, artistic in many forms,&nbsp; undeniably intelligent and stout in nature. As odd as it may sound, he practically encompasses everything I have ever wanted to find in a person, be it partner in crime or lover in time. His name is Ray. I look forward to the inevitably wonderful things that will come of spending time with him. 

I will end my entry at this. Do not doubt that I am happy right now. Far too many great things have come to happen&nbsp;in my life&nbsp;to not smile politely in response. I will keep in touch.

"event","I'm tired of feeling OK. I'm tired of being in a simple emotional plateau.&nbsp;  I think I just realized how my loneliness keeps getting worse. I choose to come home late at night because it means that I can spend more time with people, not just friends, but just people. Afterwards I come home, tired, and fall asleep without a moment to think. 

I'm beginning to let go of things and people I once held on to though I think it's due to the apathy and exhaustion that I've been developing. I honestly just don't care any more and have given up. Life has been moving too fast. Seriously, there's a lot that I'm choosing not to tell you guys. If you only knew half of the shit happening to me and to those around me. It's better to not know though. We all have demons to fend off; These are just a few of mine.

Jose is back in my life. It's been a year and six months since him and I went out. Though to be honest, I don't think that he ever left my life to begin with. I'm thinking of actually bothering to make things work this time around. I know that I care for him and love him (not in love with him) but I can't help but feel that I may only want to be with him in order to fight off my recent plague of melancholy. How do you tell the difference between wanting to be with someone and just the idea of being with them?


I'm not depressed. I just miss feeling happy. 
I'm talking about REAL happiness."

"event","I just want to say that I won't pursue you. You have no idea what I'm saying or that I'm saying it to you, but nonetheless I need to let it be known.

I won't be held accountable for the heartbreak of someone innocent. I won't take the responsibility for your mistakes or poor decision making. I like you but I'm not going to try or fight for your attention. I don't want to have to carry around the guilt that someone has to be sad for my happiness.

So to you I say, You can make all the effort because you won't be getting anything from me while you're taken.



For those that seriously doubt that, I'm ready to prove you wrong."

"event","I sat down at a park bench today to write. I was in need of it. My mind had begun to become flustered with way too many things lately. The stresses of life have recently been getting the best of me.

As I sat down to write I reflected on the things that have occurred in the past months. I realized how many things changed and how many things were lost. Sometimes you completely forgot how it is that you arrive to your current situation because you get so caught up in the moment.

I feel that I'm in a moment in my life in which I need to sit and reflect. 


My biggest fear has always been to be left alone in the crowd. My friends have always meant the world to me. And it hit me: I'm slowly drifting away from each one of them; whether intentional or mutual.

Sasha, Carlos, Alexis, Paris, Alex and Laurin. These are the people I have come to call my best friends.

Summer was great because I was able to see these people at almost any given time of the day. And now with school, work, the fraternity, even life itself, I'm losing grasp of them. I was beginning to think that my worst fear was coming true.

But while sitting down and writing...watching the people run by in the park, children kicking around soccer balls and mothers pushing strollers, it occurred to me: I have to let go sometimes. I can't rely on people so much. I have to rely on myself and be strong. I can't constantly fight the forces of fate. As I told Alex and Carlos before: If we drift away, let it be, thats how life is. There's a reason for everything and a place for everyone.

I always tell everyone to let things take their course, but I never am able to apply that to my life. So I figure now, why not try it out?

I just want you all to know, that no matter I still love you. Nothing can change that."

"event","<p><br />so so so! yesterday i totally went to lauren's house and flew a kite. at first i kinda sucked and could&nbsp; only get less than half of the the string out. then, due to sheer determination and adrenaline, i flew it to the end of the string where it attached the handle, it almost reached the tops of the the evergreens surounding the lawn. lauren who had never flown a kite, before yesterday; picked it up swimmingly and once i had it stablized at its peak, she took over and maintained it.<br />funny thing, once i had accomplished my goal, i grew instantly bored, rofl. i tried to fly the frizbee that terrance, eric and andy were shooting, but i sucked tremendously.<br /><br />pizza hut is a cake walk, even with this paperwork for management. apparently the area director matt is confident in my success, he has promoted me quickly and made this training thing move from 6 mos worth to 2 mos worth. hopefully i won't b here as long as i was with mcds. btw, my checks are definitely fatter! lol, sorry had to gloat a bit ^_^<br /><br />i bough an exacto knife yesterday to assist with my bentoing. i have 2 contests to enter by tomorrow and the prizes are pretty stout. there is a demo at hazard thursday that ill go check out and maybe drag lauren along if she's not working. im determined to find her a worthwhile skater rat! *shakes fist*<br /><br />haven't lost anymore weight, and ive prolly caught back on&nbsp;a coupla of lbs with the way im eating these truffles i bought :/ good thing i got a one piece and a two piece swimsuit this year. e_o.<br /><br />well ciao for now. ttyl, i think ive broken my writer's block. :D</p><br />"

"event","was some good fun last weekend. the boys got to skate and the girls got to soak in some culture.
and by culture i mean, fend off the hobos, watch the tennesee transvestite festival, see some spectacular views, and listen to the boys bitch about eachother... and they say girls r bad! 
but all in all it was a good trip. thanks spel sis for helping me when i needed a guide. 
one thing i noticed is that the ppl had a small town mentality. they looked down their noses at us and spoke condescendingly. i mean, come on chattanooga, your city is baby food compared to atlanta! so break off those corn cobbs out yall ass and stop trying to rip us off! were cosmopolitan! dont try that shit on us!!

next time i hear we are going to savannah. ummm sunshine and beaches... 
im down! fall break ends today then its crunch time. which means, crunch until friday then im not responsible for my behavior. (Jk--i hope)"

As long as you aren't afraid of danger there's a place for you in society, even if it's a rather dark and wicked place.

"event","<p>so im just realizing what optimism feels like. im so ready to start on my senior thesis and get the hell outta spelman college. and after that? who knows?? i have to talk to the dean about getting last year wiped from my transcipts with the hope of saving my GPA.&nbsp; Graduate school? MBA? JOB? all of these things are all big question marks right now, but im keeping my options open, if not for right now then for later. for once tomorrow looks bright and im opening my windows to let the sunshine in. how corny.<br /><br />i kinda feel like a failure for taking a semester off... but then i compare myself (of course) to others my age and think &quot;well damn! im not doing too bad!&quot; did you know that only 12.5% of Black Americans have a BS or BA?! and only .5% have their PHD?? i can do this and this time im not even doubtful.&nbsp; andys been a really big support for me and im so excited about our future together!!<br /><br />speaking of that guy, he and some friends are working on a full length skate video and its coming out pretty well! my hands are itching to try zack b's high def camera and im sure hed oblige me.&nbsp; im really proud of some of the tricks these guys are pulling up and down some treacherous terrain. pretty badass if i do say so myself. me and lauren have reconnected and she still putting herself in self-damaging situations with ppl who do nothing&nbsp;but hold her down-- and she knows it. i kinda feel that im gonna have to arrange a convenient accident for her leech if she doesnt break this whole &quot;sugar mama drama&quot;--mostly because andy wants to give him that long drop with a sudden stop. and we cant have him in prison now can we?<br /><br />maybe ill get back into this whole livejournal thing. i really want to go on a trip somewhere tropical just to chill and romanticize with my boo. especially&nbsp;since these last coupla weeks of sleeping on the livingroom floor are wearing at my damn patience! GD if im suppose to be living with you and cleaning after you, can i have SOME personal space!! i love my sister to death but this is just a reminder that this is a temporary habitat.<br /><br />well im off to do the things ive set off to do. mostly boring but im sure ill holler later!<br />ps- omg 21? oct 23?

"event","ive realized that i can take a lot of crap. im one of those people who doesnt blow up in situations. for me to get pissed it takes months and months of exposure.

1. coming back to my dorm to find out that my roommate has been wearing my shoes,
2. noticing someone slept in my bed,
3. lack of sleep due to other's radiating lamp that continually stays on,
4. annonying 6th grader periods where roommate acted like a 6th grader,
5. enduring high school subjects like: ""how to tell a guy i like him without telling him"", ""where do i pee from"" etc.


yeah so this is a roommate tantrum. ive noticed that after a whole year of living with one other person, i really dont know her. she was like a chameleon, changing her personality, physical appearance to match those around her. quite strange and concerning.

ugh! im so glad im free from that--experience."

"event","we have this half of a semester long course were we speak in front of a small group of people. our first project is to talk about the origins of our names and what it means to us. wtf. this is what i speeched:

    "" My name is TiLei Sharee Hill. Thats t-i-l-e-i. not any other way you would think to spell it. When I asked my mother the origin of my name, she said it stems from the Tahitian word meaning ""comes from the sea.""
     Now I really don't think anything about my personality relates to the sea, ocean, or lake. Though my zodiac sign is a water sign, scorpio.
     However, my name is very important to me. It represents my uniqueness. My individuality as a black woman, as a human being. I have learned to not only accept this birth-given uniqueness, but to also appreciate my distinct title.
     To prove the uniqueness of my name, I googled tilei.  To my surprise, I found out that tilei is also the name of: a website sales company in the netherlands, a place in Africa, and a ceremony involving tea leaves.  Who knew tilei could encompass so much!""



yeah so pretty much its all bullshit. my name aint tahitian. im just proving a point. I have sworn that all of my speeches are going to contain a hint of bullshit.
i dont think they'll be able to smell it... do you?"

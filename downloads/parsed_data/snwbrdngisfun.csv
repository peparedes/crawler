 Step 1: Put your music player (iTunes, etc) on random.
 Step 2: Pick your favorite lines from the first 10 songs that play.
 Step 3: Post and let everyone you know guess what song the lines come from.
 Step 4: Bold out the songs when someone guesses correctly.



1) OH MAN! LOOK AT THOSE CAVEMEN GO
2) `Cause Saturday night's the night I like
3)  It's been a long time since I did the Stroll.
4)  Who knows why you wanna lay there and revel in your abandon.
5)  All the way, all the way, all the way, there's no where left we can meet
6)  TO AVOID COMPLICATIONS SHE NEVER KEPT THE SAME ADDRESS
7)  You know I can't let you slide through my hands
8)  I will choose a path that's clear
9)  I'm feelin' good now, but
10) Take your time... Don't live too fast



Don't Google fools."

It may sound odd but I need seious responses.<br>
<br>
<br>
Who is the <b>BEST</b> person ever?<br>
<br>
Now I'm not talking about your hero, idol or favorite marching band,
I'm talking about the best person that has ever walked this big blue
marble we call earth.<br>
<br>
<br>
My response: DMX, because that guy has no flaws.<br>
<br>
I need a person and a reason please. <br>
<br>
Oh yea, one more rule, Jesus Christ is of course numero one so after him who is the best person.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time.<br>"

"event","Month later and here comes another badass updateage for Kevin. A lot has gone down since the last update, so here is a little synopsis of the last month and a half:


-Joshes party, nuff said

-Went snowboarding for the last time

-Got the Styx anthology

-Failed some whack math test

-Taking road test pretty soon

-Leaving for Florida tomorrow

-Made JV baseball

-New shoes?? (I dont know if thats list material)

-Realized I was the best white rapper/freestyler since Vanilla Ica (Fuck Eminem)

So its been going pretty good. Cant argue. I feel bad for everyone that grounded, it seemed like the popular thing this last month. Spring is here which means summer is here which means FREE! I havent looked forward to a summer vacation in about a year. Pretty pumped. And since ill have a car this summer even better.

Well thats it for no. Dont expect another update for anohter month



FROOOOMMMM ME!"

"event","Ok, so it's almost been 3 months since my last update!!  WOW!!  Time flies....

My kids had the chicken pox last month, what fun, what fun!!  Actually, they both did really well.  There was only a night or two of complaining from Ashley, and no complaining at all from Sean.

Scott's work had a picnic on June 5th.  We went to SportsWorld in Kitchener.  We all had a good time...though Sportsworld isn't all that exciting and I would never want to pay to go there!  

Wow, you'd think there'd be more to tell in 3 months, eh?  I'm just not in the mood for a detailed update, I guess.

I'm gonna try to be a better live journaler from now one though.  ;)"

"event","So yesterday we had a birthday party for Sean.   We had invited 4 kids to this party.  Not one showed up!  WTF?  I had talked to 2 of the parents before hand and they both said their kid would be here.  The other 2 didn't bother to call and tell me either way whether they were coming.  Jerks!   Last week was March Break so Lorna thinks maybe the invites got left in the backpacks for the week and won't be found until tonight.  I can see that as the reason 2 of the kids didn't show up, but the other 2, who's parents said they'd be here?  WTF?  I was so pissed off!   Sean spend the night at Lorna's and was supposed to come home to decorations and friends...instead he just got the decorations.  He says he had a good day, and doesn't seem to remember inviting anyone to his party so it's no big loss for him but I'm still bitter about it.  I will see these people tomorrow, when the kids go back to school.  I can't decide whether I'm gonna ask them what the fuck or just ignore it like it didn't matter one bit to me.  Jerks.  Just thinking about it now has me all pissed off again.  I should've just tried to forget it instead of coming here bitching about it.  

Sean got a bunch of cool gifts just the same, and I took a bunch of pictures that will eventually make their way to Webshots.

One of Sean's gifts was The Incredibles on DVD.  We ordered Chinese food for dinner and sat down and watched the movie.  We had seen it in the theater when it came out, and it was just as good as I remembered it.  It was almost 9pm by the time the movie was done.  We quickly went through the bedtime routine and hussled the kids off to bed.  They were really tired and didn't put up much of a fight.  Not that they fight much any other time...

After the kids went to bed we played a few board games, Balderdash being one of them.  I hate that game!   Lorna, Brandon and Brittany left about 2:30am.  I was dead tired and was happy to finally get in bed and was asleep in less than 5 minutes, for a change.  

I slept until about 1pm.  I didn't mean to, it just kinda happened that way.  I hate sleeping so late!  It throws off my whole day.  Blah."

"event","Remember that tonsillitis Ashley had?  Well, of course Scott got it, then I got it and now Sean is fighting it off and doing pretty well at it so far.  It started Tuesday night for me and I was pretty much a useless lump of flesh from Wednesday until yesterday (Saturday).   I went three days without caffein and I've been without a smoke since Tuesday night, 5 whole days!!  Though I'm kinda craving one now and may end up having one tomorrow sometime.  I'll try to hold out, though.

This was the most sick I've been in....well, I don't know how long.  I very much wanted to bash my head in and put an end to all the pain.  LOL  Yes, I was a big baby!  Scott managed to get up and go to work every morning.  I didn't hear him complaining too much.  Ashley got a little better and went to school all last week, though she wasn't totally healed.  I took her and Sean to the Dr. on Friday.  Ashley had woken up Thursday night complaining of a sore throat again.  She still had those white pussy lookin' things on her tonsils.  So anyways, I had the Dr. check her out and he gave her some stronger antibiotics, he's concerned that the first dose didn't get rid of it entirely.  The Dr. then checked out Sean and myself and said our tonsils were a little pink and we'd just have to suffer through.  Great, thanks.  Jerk!  LOL  By then the worst was over though 'cause I woke up much better about 1am Saturday.  My sore throat had gone for the moment and I was ready to throw a party!  LOL  I think that was thanks to the ibuprofen, though.  Still got a bit of a sore throat that comes and goes but I know I'm on the mend.  I just hope Sean can continue to fight this thing off like he has been because we're having his birthday party this Saturday!!  He's gonna be the big FOUR!  LOL  We can't have him sick for that.

That's pretty much all that's been going on here for the past week.  I slept as much as I could whenever I could.  The poor kids, I feel bad.  The house was a total mess and both their parents were much too worn out and sick to be any fun.  But we're trying to make up for that now.  Good thing I had just finished doing all the laundry before getting sick.  And I had cleaned the fish tank Tuesday.  If I hadn't done that then the fish would either be swimming in green water all week or they'd be dead right now.  LOL  That's not funny, I love my fish!  ;)

Tuesday night I finished the Harrison Ford biography.  I really enjoyed it.  There were a few interesting things I was going to point out here but then I got sick and now it's been almost a week since I finished it and I can't remember.  LOL  I don't feel like trying to remember, so I guess you'll just never know.  :P     I started another book that night, One For The Money by Janet Evanovich, but only read the first chapter.  I was so sick I couldn't even read until last night.  Any other time I tried it my eyes were just swimming across the page, all blurry.  I couldn't focus on the words and I couldn't think about anything but how much it hurt to swallow anyways so reading was out.  So today I finally finished that book and have moved on to The Lost by Jack Ketchum.  This one was recommended to me many years ago, I forgot why, what the person had to say about it, other than it was really good.  So, I'm hoping they didn't lie to me oh so long ago.  ;)

Nothing else of interest has happened here lately.  We were supposed to go see Robots with the kids this weekend but that didn't happen, for obvious reasons.  It is March Break this week for our school kids so we're thinking of taking them maybe Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.  Whenever we're all feeling up to it.

Remember Lorna, Brandon and Brittany stopping by for a surprise visit on Saturday?  Well, they've all got the sickness too...that'll teach 'em not to call first!  LOL  They should all be on the mend by now.

Made another batch of homemade stew last night.  Finished it tonight.  Kids don't like it, they said.  They prefer the canned stuff.  Jerks.  They had grilled cheese for dinner tonight.  Then we baked cookies.  Pillsbury, very easy baking, but I still screwed it up.  I could've made 32 small cookies or 18 big cookies.  I made 15, some big, some small and some medium.  LOL   

Ok, I'm tired of sitting here.  I have been here about 20 minutes now.  This is the longest I've been in front of the computer since Tuesday morning, and I really didn't miss it that much....though I know I'll be back into my regular routine of addiction in no time.  LOL

So, if anyone is reading this and wondered what the hell happened to me...now you know.  If you know anyone else who is wondering, pass the word on, would ya?  Thanks.  :)"

So, I mentioned I was making a roast yesterday, right?  Well, it was DE-licious!  YUM!  I wish I had another one in the freezer to make tomorrow!  LOL

Lorna, Brandon and Brittany showed up just before dinner was ready.  They were out ice skating all afternoon, some thing to do with an aunt's work renting an arena.  They also supplied food, pizza being one of the things they offered.  I thought I heard talk of hot dogs too.  Anyways, they ended up with 12 left over pizzas, so they brought 2 here for us.   They weren't hungry so we ate without them.  Did I mention it was delicious?  Yeah, thought so.  I didn't get around to making vanilla pudding for dessert though, I actually forgot all about it.  Bad me!

The rest of last night was spend watching Spike TV.  I wasn't interested so I did some reading instead.  

I finished 'I' Is for Innocent this morning.  Another good read from Sue Grafton.  :)  I've already started the Harrison Ford biography.  I'm on a major reading kick these days!

Scott is back to working his regular 4am - 12:30pm shift this week.  So he's already in bed.  It'll be nice getting things back to our regular routine.  All last week was really screwy, having him here until 11:30am every morning, then not coming home till the kids' bed time.  Weird.  I much prefer his regular shift.  I have to go to the library tomorrow to pick up some books and a PC game (for the kids) that are on hold for me.  If he was working the other shift I'd have to go in the morning.  I much prefer afternoon travel.  LOL

"event","I finally finished reading The Da Vinci Code this morning.  It wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be, though it did get me interested in learning more about religion and Leonardo Da Vinci.  *laugh*  Wrote down a few things I'd like to look up online sometime.  We'll see if I ever get around to do that.  ;)

Started 'I' Is For Innocent by Sue Grafton immediately after finishing The Da Vinci Code.  I've got a couple books waiting for me at the library, I have until Monday to pick them up so I'm hoping to finish this book by then.  I hate to make a trip to the library without having at least one book to return first.

We are having a lazy Saturday here in the Slater house.  We played a few games this morning, Mouse Trap and Don't Break The Ice.  Then I did some reading while Scott and the kids rotated between tv and computers.  Got a roast in the oven right now and it's almost dinner time.  I'm so excited!  LOL  I love roast beef on bread smothered in gravy, with carrots and mashed potatoes.  Very exciting stuff!  Mmmmm, I can't wait!  Got a little bit of chocolate pudding in the fridge, left over from the other night.  Maybe I'll make some vanilla to go with it tonight.  Or lemon.  Lemon Jello pudding!  YUM!

No plans for tonight, probably more of the same...reading or watching tv.  Maybe watch a movie with Scott after the kids are in bed.  Ashley's feeling much better now that she's had a few days of antibiotics in her, but she's still got a nasty cough.  :(  So, no staying up late for her tonight.

Ok, now I'm just ramblng.  I gotta go check on the roast and start making some gravy.  YUMMY!!!"

Ashley wasn't feeling any better this morning, so I called the Dr. at 9am when they opened.  They said they could see us at 10:30am, which meant we had to haul ass out of here in 20 minutes so we could catch the bus in time.  If we missed that bus we'd have to wait another 1/2 hour, making us just a little bit late for our appointment.  We managed to catch the bus, and were about 20 minutes early for our appointment.  The Dr. saw us pretty quickly, and immediately diagnosed Ashley with tonsilitis.  What fun!  Poor kid.  I was expecting that anyways, before I called the Dr. I had a look at her throat with a flashlight and I saw white lumpy things on her throat.  Poor girl!  We got her some Novamoxin down at the pharmacy downstairs from the doctor's office then made our way home.  She is still coughing quite a bit and had a bit of fever, but has only had one dose of Novamoxin so we can't expect any change just yet.  She has to take it 2 more times before bed.  This stuff usually works really quickly so I'm thinking she'll be much better in the morning.  Hopefully she'll feel well enough to go to school soon.  I hate it when she has to miss school.

Yesterday I got her and Sean 3 Mickey Mouse Kindergarten cd roms from the library so she's still learning while away from school.  Right now she is making ""music""...which is more noise than music but she's having fun anyways.  Yesterday she was doing some reading which was really amazing.  I knew she was good at reading, but I didn't realize she was that good! 

I couldn't find the link to the quiz I made about myself, dammit.  I'm not in the mood to make another one just yet so unless I come across the link, you won't be seeing it here any time soon.

I woke up with a soar throat again this morning.  My muscles were sore and I did NOT want to leave the house today.  I feel run down and I don't know why, I've been getting to bed at a decent hour!  I hope I start to feel better soon.

Made another batch of homemade stew last night.  This one was a little different, added onions and celery.  So yummy!  I can't wait for leftovers today!"

<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>Yesterday was Dairius' 6th birthday party.&nbsp; He lives down the street from us, and is also in Ashley's class at school.&nbsp; Ashley talks about him quite a bit, as does Sean.&nbsp; He's a nice kid and I like it when he's around for them to play with outside.&nbsp; I never have to worry about them...unlike when they play with Cody from across the street, who is 10 and a pain in the ass!&nbsp; I really do NOT like that kid.&nbsp; But anyways...&nbsp; lol</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>So, yesterday was the birthday party.&nbsp; It was held at a bowling alley.&nbsp; What fun!&nbsp; Ashley woke up Saturday morning with a sore throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;She spent most of Saturday on the couch resting and watching tv.&nbsp;&nbsp;During dinner that night we thought she'd have to&nbsp;miss the birthday party, expecting her to&nbsp;be really sick on Sunday.&nbsp; She&nbsp;went to bed about 7pm Saturday night, Scott went and laid in bed with her while they watched a&nbsp;Spongebob DVD on her tv.&nbsp; (I am SO glad they got tvs/dvd players for christmas!!)&nbsp; At about 7:45pm Saturday I shut the tv off and told Ashley it was time to get some real sleep.&nbsp; I gave her some medicine for pain and fever and she was asleep in less than 5 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; She woke up Sunday morning at about 7am crying about a sore throat again.&nbsp; Scott got up and gave her more pain meds and put her on the couch.&nbsp; I'm not sure why, but when I got up almost an hour later, I found Ashley passed out on the couch with the tv on.&nbsp;&nbsp; She woke up about 8:30am and seemed to be doing better.&nbsp; She was sweating, which is a good sign.&nbsp; When Scott saw her he said she looked MUCH better than she had only an hour and a half before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though she still sounded sick, she looked good and said she felt well enough to go to the party, so we got ourselves ready to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; We picked up another classmate, Jordyn, along the way.&nbsp; She was invited to the party but her mother had no way of getting her there so we offered to bring her along with us, on the bus.&nbsp; The kids seemed excited about it.&nbsp; It's funny what makes them happy.&nbsp; lol</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>So, we get to the party just after 1pm.&nbsp; The party is from 1-3.&nbsp; We leave Ashley and Jordyn with the partiers and take Sean over to the restaurant party of the bowling alley.&nbsp; We ate lunch and killed about an hour there, then we headed over to a lane of our own and *tried* to get Sean to bowl.&nbsp; He was only interested for about 5 minutes, then he got frustrated because he wasn't hitting any pins so he gave up.&nbsp; Then he tried again, then he gave up.&nbsp; At some point he tried again, got a spare, but then gave up when he missed on his next ball.&nbsp; So, I ended up bowling 3 games all by myself.&nbsp; I LOVE to bowl, so it was fun.&nbsp; I didn't do very well, it's been a long time...I think my scores were 115, 97, and 138.&nbsp; 97!?&nbsp; My father would be ashamed...When I was 14 (or maybe a bit younger) I bowled a 227 for crying out loud!&nbsp; lol&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to join a league....maybe I'll have an easier time of talking Scott into it when the kids are older.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>Anyways,&nbsp; the party was over at 3pm.&nbsp; We grabbed the girls and the 5 of us made our way home.&nbsp; Didn't take too long, almost an hour.&nbsp; We managed to catch the 2 buses we needed fairly quickly.&nbsp; It was just before 4pm when we got home.&nbsp; Ashley sat on the couch watching tv, Sean got sent to his room for being a little shit.&nbsp; He ended up falling asleep so we all went in to wake him up, and that's when Scott decided he was going to play Lego in there with anyone who wanted to join him.&nbsp; I've honestly never had much interest in Lego, so I left.&nbsp; I had a book I wanted very badly to finish, and I was almost there so I went to read in the living room.&nbsp; That made me sleepy, so I guess I ended up having a 20 minute nap on the couch.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; When I woke up I realized I had better feed these children!&nbsp; So, I got them something to eat, but by that time Ashley was feeling rotten again.&nbsp; Instead of eating she sat there crying about her sore throat.&nbsp; At 6:30pm I decided I'd heard enough.&nbsp; Her eyes were red and watery and she looked like she was going to pass out any moment!&nbsp; So, we got her teeth brushed, changed her into comfy pj's, gave her more pain meds and stuck her in bed.&nbsp; We let her have her tv on again, but she fell asleep in less than 10 minutes.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>It's funny how she felt fine for the party...it's funny what the body can do when there is the threat of missing a birthday party with bowling and cake!&nbsp; LOL</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>So here it is, 7:15am now and Ashley is still sleeping.&nbsp; Oh wait, here she is!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; She says she's feeling ""not good"", but we'll have to wait and see.&nbsp; Maybe she'll be staying home from school today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>I finished the 6th and final library book yesterday.&nbsp; They are all due back today, so I'll be headed there soon.&nbsp; I have to more books on hold there, and I'm hoping that will keep me from picking up too many books to brind home.&nbsp; LOL</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>The book was called Messiah by Boris Starling and it was a pretty good read.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>I have now started The Da Vinci Code.&nbsp; I'm not very far into it at all so I haven't formed an opinion just yet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>Scott is on afternoon shift this week, 12 - 8:30pm...or something like that.&nbsp; This is the first time in about 4 years he's been on this shift so that'll be different.&nbsp; That is why I'm heading off to the library very shortly.&nbsp; They open at 9am.&nbsp; If I want to do anything without dragging the children with me, I'll have to do it before 11am, when Scott leaves for work.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>So, I guess I had better be going and getting myself ready for my early morning trip to the library!&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4></FONT>&nbsp;</P>"

I just finished putting up some ""new"" photos on Webshots.  They're new to you, but they're photos from December so they're kind of old.  lol  Here's the link:  http://community.webshots.com/scripts/editPhotos.fcgi?action=viewall&albumID=282119645

I finished reading ""H"" Is For Homicide by Sue Grafton the other day.  I got off to a slow start with it, but found it very exciting near the end.  Now I'm reading Messiah by Boris Starling.  Off to a slow start with that one, as well.  I just don't have as much time to read these days, but I plan on reading a bunch this weekend, as this book (and the 5 others I've read) is due back at the library on Monday.

I figured out a way to limit how many books I take out of the library, since the 5 or 6 I usually end up taking out are way too much.  I've gone online and put some books on hold.  Only 3 of them are available now, so I'll just go in and pick those up and head on home.  Saves me from looking through all the books and picking out too many, and saves me some time since I never like to be away from home too long (crazy, I know. lol).   I've got a Harrison Ford biography waiting for me, which I'm excited about, the next Sue Grafton book (""I"" is for Innocent) and another one that I can't remember.

I WILL start The Da Vinci Code before I start any library books, though.  I'm dying to get to that book!!!"

"event","What a great read!!  I finished it last night and enjoyed it very much.  Will have to check out more Christopher Fowler books in the future.

On to 'H' Is For Homicide by Sue Grafton.  Tried to start it this afternoon but only got about 2 pages read.  It is pretty late now, so I probably won't read any tonight.  

Just finished watching the first 4 episodes from the first season of Trailer Park Boys.  What a messed up show that is.  Funny in a ridiculous sort of way.

We had an early Valentine's Day here today.  Scott didn't want to wait till Monday.  In the past Scott has set out the stuff for the kids in the morning, but when it falls on a weekday he misses seeing them find their goodies so he decided doing it today would be more fun.  He went out shopping this afternoon.  Ashley got a new Kim Possible shirt and pants set, 2 Kim Possible dvd's and Kim Possible sunglasses.  That girl is all about the Kim Possible.  LOL  Sean got a pair of paints,  2 pants/jacket outfits, a Tonka button up shirt, a pair of Hotwheels sunglasses and a Gravedigger monster truck.  A bigger one that what he's already got.  Of course he loves it.  We had pizza for dinner and little cupcakes with pink frosting and red and white tiny candy hearts sprinkled on top.  Yummy!  The kids got to stay up late (9pm!) because it was a ""special"" night.  We watched one of the Kim Possible dvd's ""A Sitch In Time"".  

Scott gave me a new nightshirt and a card with my name on it, talking all about what ""Deanna"" is all about.  I was impressed that he found a card with my name printed on it, since it isn't often my name is on anything.  Of course I am nothing like what a ""Deanna"" is...probably the complete opposite, but I'm not really a good judge of my own character.   I wasn't expecting anything, so that was a nice surprise.  I didn't get Scott anything.  I didn't think we were doing gifts...and I know he'd rather I saved the money.  If there was anything he wanted he would've bought it himself."

LOL  I was worried it wouldn't turn out and no one would like it..blah blah blah.  Turns out everyone enjoyed it.  YAY!  I'm so stuffed it hurts!

Tuesday night I finished reading Spirit by Graham Masterton.  A little long-winded, but it was a good story and I enjoyed it for the most part.  I'm still not too keen on Masterton's style of writing, but I'll probably continue to read his books.

Last Tuesday night I started Spanky by Christopher Fowler and I'm really enjoying it!  I had read about 75 pages by yesterday (wed.) evening and am now almost half way through and still enjoying it very much.  I can't wait to see how this one ends!!

The kids are watching Kim Possible, which I had taped while we were busy having an early delicious homemade beef stew dinner.  Ashley is giggling herself silly, she really loves this show.

Scott plans on watching Kill Bill Vol. 1 tonight at 9.  I'll either join him and tape ER at 10, or hang out in the bedroom and watch it, and read during commercials.  LOL  Most likely I'll tape ER and sit here at the computer and listen to Kill Bill in the background.  I really need to show more willpower over this damn machine.  It sucks me in WAY too much.

As soon as this over-stuffed sluggishness wears off I'll be doing the dishes.  Fun stuff!"

<br><br>
After being caught and convicted of the murders, Bundy accepted prison, acquired a new name and started his killing spree all over again. Soon after, Bundy was caught, but not before taking the lives of 3 more women.
<br><br>
Almost all of Bundy's victims were young white girls with long dark hair parted down the middle, all were raped, beaten and sodomized.

"event","Yeah, it's been a while since I've updated, I know.  

Jan. 22nd was my 30th birthday.  The plan was for Scott's sister Lorna to take me out shopping in the afternoon, after Scott got home from work, and while I was gone he was going to decorate the place up nice.  The kids were going to decorate the banana cake Lorna baked for me and then I'd be all surprised when I got home.  Unfortunately Mother Nature, bitch that she is, dumped a shitload of snow on us and we couldn't go anywhere.  For a while there it didn't even look like Lorna, Brandon, Brittany and the cake were going to make it here.  They finally made it, though, about 5:30pm.  I wanted pizza for my birthday dinner, and because of the snow all delivery was cancelled so Lorna, Scott and Brandon went out to pick some up.  The guys had to go with her in case the care got stuck somewhere.  It was awful weather.  This is the 2nd year in a row we got a bunch of snow on my birthday, though this year we got more than last year.

Got some pretty cool gifts:  a pair of Hello Kitty pj's, Trivial Pursuit DVD Edition which is pretty cool, a couple books - The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, a book on Da Vinci's artwork, that I'm told goes along with the Dan Brown book and The Teeth of the Tiger by Tom Clancy and a juicer.  The juicer has come in handy recently.  I think once I get into making fresh juice it'll get a lot of use.  I also got $50 from my brother-in-law, Jimmy.

Scott and I just finished trying out The Master Cleanser.  Ugh.  Not fun!  Scott went almost 5 whole days without food, I lasted almost 2.  Screw that!  Dieting, fasting, cleansing...it's just not for me.  I did lose 3lbs overnight, as did Scott.  That was pretty cool.  If I could've stuck with it for the whole 10 days I might've lost about 20 pounds.  Going without food just isn't worth it for me.  Today is the first day Scott and I have eaten.  I can't believe he lasted that long, being the lover of food that he is.

Since I last wrote anything here I've finished 3 books:  Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz (which I loved!), The Town by Bentley Little (which was a little slow and not all that great, really) and Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas by James Patterson (which I started late last night and finished early this morning.  A bunch of people told me I'd cry.  I didn't.  It was kind of a predictable love story/tragic story type thing.)  Now I'm reading Spirit by Graham Masterton.  I'm only about 20 pages in and I'm not finding it all that interesting yet.

We went 4 days without much tv and very little computer time.  It was....different.  LOL  I didn't really miss the computer or the tv all that much.  The kids learned to amuse themselves or play together without always having the tv on in the background.  We are trying to teach them to sit and watch the damn thing when they turn it on, not turn it on and leave the room like they always do.  Ashley's new favourite show is now Kim Possible, and Sean enjoys watching it too.  Today he started saying ""I'm Kim Possible.  I'm going to save the world!""  LOL

I have a ton of pictures to put up on Webshots, ones that go back to Christmas for cyring out loud!  I really MUST get going on that!  One day...One magical day.  :)

Lorna called today.  She wants to take the kids overnight on Friday.  YAY!  Will be nice to have some time away from them, and nice for them to be away from us for a night.  They always love spending the night at Auntie Lorna's house.  No plans for Scott and I that I know of.  Which is fine...we never did much before we had kids anyways, not like we're missing out on anything and need the time away.

I guess that's about all that's been going on here.  I'm off to get caught up on my other Live Journal friends and communities.  :)"

After it was over I saw that The Apprentice was on for the next hour and a half. I quickly turned the channel. CSI is on now. Good show, but not in the mood to watch it. I hate missing the first half of the show. Was going to do some reading, I'm half way through Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. Very good read, but too restless to sit and read it at the moment.

"event","<P>It's only January and I'm already sick of all this cold weather!&nbsp; At least another 2 months to go.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; </P>
<P>I finished Full House by Janet Evanovich Monday night.&nbsp; It was a romance-ish kind of story, which I am no longer into really, but it was an amusing read.&nbsp; The lead male character was named Nick.&nbsp; The lead female character, named Billie, had a son named Joel.&nbsp; A few times in the book the names got switched to Neil and Joey.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Freaked me out the first time I read the name Neil.&nbsp; I was thinking <EM>""Who the heck is Neil!""</EM>&nbsp; I thought I must've fallen asleep when that character was introduced.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; But I quickly realized the mistake.&nbsp; Is it just me, or are books these days full of typos and grammatical errors?&nbsp; </P>
<P>Yesterday morning I started Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas.&nbsp; I've been very anxious to read this book for some time now.&nbsp; I made it to the beginning of chapter 6, page 50 last night.&nbsp; I was just so tired I couldn't stay up to read any more and was in bed about 12:30am.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Yesterday afternoon I took a trip to the library to return my books.&nbsp; Silly me, I checked out 6 more books.&nbsp; I'm not gonna get all 6 read in the 3 weeks I have these books.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll be able to renew them for another 3 weeks...if no one has put any of these books on hold.</P>
<P>Monday morning I woke up to find Ashley fish dead in the fish tank.&nbsp; What is it with all these fish!&nbsp; The kids are convinced Mommy fish is killing all the fish.&nbsp; It's just Mommy and Sean fish left.&nbsp; We'll see how long they last!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I'm tempted to get 2 more fish, but worry they will just die like the others.</P>
<P>Two more days till I'm 30.&nbsp; I don't want to be 30!&nbsp; Wahhh!&nbsp; lol&nbsp; I know it's just a number, and really no big deal but I just can't stop getting all freaked out over it.&nbsp; I've been checking for gray hairs (LOL) but haven't found any yet.&nbsp; Will have to dye my hair again soon to make sure I don't find any.&nbsp; ;)</P>
<P>We got more snow today.&nbsp; The kids are excited, our snow hill in the driveway was looking pretty pathetic.&nbsp; I should get outside and shovel sometime today.&nbsp; Maybe before Ashley goes to school.&nbsp; It looks like light snow, should be an easy job...though I'm still not looking forward to it.</P>"

"event","Today was a ""Girls Day"" / ""Boys Day"" for the Slater family.  Scott and Sean went to the Monster Truck show in Toronto with Lorna, Brandon and Brittany while Ashley and I went to the mall for a few hours.  I had to return some shirts I bought my mother for Christmas that didn't fit, and also Ashley's Barbie plate, bowl and cup set that she got for Christmas.  There was a crack in the cup.  We couldn't find another Barbie set so she got a Strawberry Shortcake set that she seems equally pleased with.

The first thing Ashley and I did was return out goods.  The woman at Northern Reflections didn't seem too pleased about giving me the money back and would've much preferred I shop around for something else there.  A quick glance told me I wouldn't find anythign so I didn't bother.  I ended up getting her 2 shirts from Cotton Ginny instead.

All I had with me was a bank card, and at the time I didn't know Mc Donald's took those so I had to get some actually cash first.  Or so I thought.  That's why did my returns first.  After that was done, cash in  hand, we headed to Mc Donald's in Wal-Mart.  We had some lunch, then did a little shopping around Wal-Mart.  We got Ashley a small set of knitting needles and a small ball of wool of her own for her to learn with.  Also bought a few more balls for the ""crazy"" or ""ugly"" blankets I'm making the kids.  (Basically, I knit a bunch of small squares with many different colours of wool and stitch them together.  I've got one on my bed and love it!)

After our Wal-Mart shopping was done we headed out to the mall so Ashley could ride some of the rides they have there.  Not worth the $1 if you ask me, but she really likes them.  I told her she could have 2 rides.  Of course she bugged for a third.  I had one looney (1 dollar coin) left but told her I was out.  Then we went to Cotton Ginny and got my Mum's shirts.  In my change was another looney.  Ashley spotted it and got all excited...so I let the kid have one more ride.  What the heck!  After that we went to the food court and had a donut from Tim Horton's (vanilla dip with chocolate sprinkles for her, boston cream for me).  Then we headed over to the dollar store where I bought Ashley some lip gloss.  This kid is turning out to be more girly than I am, though that's not saying much.  I certainly wasn't that girly when I was her age, being a tomboy and all.  She is thrilled to death with that lip gloss, which is now safely tucked under her pillow while she sleeps.

It was almost 8pm when the boys and gang finally came home from the Monster Truck show.  Sean had a great time, but said he was ""glad Auntie Lorna brought me home""...as if that's a rare occurance.  LOL  That kid loves cars so much, I knew he'd have a great time.  And it was good for him to have a day with Daddy, without Ashley around.  And it was nice for me to spend a day with just Ashley without Sean around.  We really should do that more often.

Ashley and I had gotten home about 5:30pm.  We put our stuff away then got right down to the knitting.  She was so excited about learning to knit!  Surprisingly she picked it up rather quickly.  She'll have to get used to holding the needles and wool, get her technique down but she is doing really well.  She doesn't have much patience for things though and kept wanting to stop.  A few minutes later she'd want to do a bit more, but then stop not long after starting up again.  I really am impressed with the speed in which she caught on to how it's done, and I think she'll be a knitting fool in no time if she keeps up with it.  I was 10 when I learned to knit, and I'm still not all that fancy (though I can do it with my eyes closed, which Ashley asks me to do often.  lol)

It was almost 11pm when Lorna, Brandon and Brittany left, and it was after 11 when Scott and the kids went to bed.  Either it'll be hell tomorrow with the kids' lack of sleep, or I'll get to sleep in a little bit.  I am so hoping I get to sleep in!  LOL

I finished Darkness, Tell Us by Richard Laymon Friday night, as planned.  I immediately started on Full House by Janet Evanovich, but it was getting late and I was getting tired so I didn't get much reading in.  Last night Lorna was over because her and Jimmy were supposed to go to a hockey game here in town.  They didn't go, instead the 3 of us sat downstairs shooting the shit about this and that.  The 3 of us kept yawning, none of us knowing why we were so tired.  Lorna left about 11pm, I came upstairs to read but only lasted about a half hour before I had to get up and go to bed before I fell asleep.  I haven't done any reading today, and these damn books are due back at the library Tuesday!  I'll have to squeeze in a whole bunch of reading tomorrow, and will most likely finish the book on the bus ride to the library Tuesday afternoon.  Then it's on to Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz, finally!!  I can't wait to read this book!

I think I'm gonna go try to get at least a half hour of reading in before it gets too much later.  I slept in today so I'm not really all that tired, but I'm not confident the kids will sleep in tomorrow so I'd better get to bed at a decent time tonight!"

"event","<P>Today is my brother's 38th birthday.&nbsp; I haven't talked to the guy in over 4 years, even though he only lives downtown and a half hour bus ride through the city would get me there.&nbsp; *shrug*&nbsp; We've never gotten along.&nbsp; He's hated me since birth.&nbsp; Hell, I've tried and tried, not my fault the guy hates me!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; But, I'm thinking about him anyways, wondering how he's been and what he's been up to.&nbsp; Maybe one day I'll give him a call...</P>
<P>I'm half way through Richard Laymon's Darkness, Tell Us.&nbsp; It's about a Ouija board.&nbsp; Well, a ""spirit"" contacted through a Ouija board.&nbsp; Now a gang of 6 (3 guys and 3 girls) are on their way to find a treasure this spirit, named Butler, has told them about.&nbsp; The reading is clipping along at a nice pace and I should be finished it soon.&nbsp; I know it's good when I'm trying to read it real fast so I can finally find out what happens in the end!&nbsp; Didn't have that with the last Laymon book I read.&nbsp; I just couldn't wait for it to be over so I could read something else.&nbsp; LOL</P>
<P>There is a Monster Truck show in Toronto this weekend.&nbsp; Our nephew Brandon wants to take Sean.&nbsp; I'm not sure if they will take him alone or if Scott will go with them.&nbsp; I'd go, but seating in the car is limited and I think it'd be good for Scott to go with him.&nbsp; A little father/son time together.&nbsp; They don't get enough of that.&nbsp; I'm also thinking a little mother/daughter time with Ashley would be fun.&nbsp; I have a few things I need to return at the mall and when I mentioned it to her she seemed pleased with the idea of spending a day at the mall just the two of us.</P>
<P>I'm all out of smokes.&nbsp; Tonight just might be the night I quit!&nbsp; I've bummed a few off Jimmy, and will probably bum one or two more before the night is through, but when I wake up tomorrow I'll be shit outta luck.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll be a raving bitch and dying for a smoke by the end of the day, but I'll give it a go and maybe actually quit this time.</P>
<P>It was over 10 degrees out today.&nbsp; January 13th!!!&nbsp; What the hell is up with that?&nbsp; This weather is just plain crazy.&nbsp; All the snow we had has just about melted away.&nbsp; We have a little bit on our driveway, where Scott made the kids a hill to sled down, but we're just about the only ones on the block with snow left.&nbsp; It'll probably be 30 below tomorrow!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Wow, mother nature really IS a bitch.&nbsp; ;)</P>
<P>My Mum and Aunt Sue came for a visit on Tuesday.&nbsp; It had been quite some time since I'd seen Aunt Sue.&nbsp; Wow, almost a year I guess.&nbsp; She's my favourite aunt, a really great person.&nbsp; She rocks!!&nbsp; I really should make an effort to see her more.&nbsp; It was really great seeing her again.</P>
<P>Ok, so this wasn't much of an update.&nbsp; Nothing much going on around here.&nbsp; ER is about to start in a few minutes so I'm going to go get settled on the couch.&nbsp; It's been a few weeks since I've seen it and I've really been missing it!</P>"

"event","We lost another goldfish last night.  The Daddy fish I just bought not a week ago.  I don't know what's up with that!  Everything seemed to be fine.  He was alive last night before I sat down to watch Las Vegas (I've gotten hooked on that show, and Josh Duhamel is a cutie!)at 9pm.  But when I fed them at about 12:30am I could only see 3 of them swimming around.  It's a small tank and odd that I couldn't see the other one.  I finally found him stuck on the bottom of the tank between the wall and the air pump.  Poor guy.  I left him there for the kids to find in the morning.  I don't know which one found it but Sean was the more upset of the two.  He wants me to go buy another fish later today.  Don't think that's gonna happen.  I would like a new and bigger tank.  There is one I liked for $60 at the pet store that I suggested to Scott for my birthday.  Don't think I'll be getting that, though.  

I finished ""G"" Is For Gumshoe last night.  It was a good story, as usual.  I enjoy the way Sue Grafton writes and I like the Kinsey Millhone character.  I have 7 days to read the remaining 2 novels before they have to be back at the library.  I'll be reading a Richard Laymon book next, can't remember the name of it right now.  This one might take me most of the next week to read.  LOL

Ashley woke up sometime after 4am.  She grabbed her orange juice from the fridge and crawled in bed with me, same routine as every morning.  She woke me up asking me to put kids' shows on the tv.  That's when I saw the time!  I turned the tv to Treehouse and thought she'd watch a bit and go to sleep.  Just before 6am Sean cralwed into bed with us.  I was half asleep and listening to the two of them talking when Ashley says ""I was up really early and I'm gonna be real tired later!""  So I sent her back to bed.  LOL  Sean started crying over something and he ended up back in bed too.  They stayed there about an hour or so, then Ashley wanted to know if she could come out.  I asked her if she'd gone back to sleep.  She hesitated and I told her it's ok to tell the truth, no matter what it is.  She said she hadn't slept.  Hopefully she just doesn't remember sleeping!  LOL   It could end up being a rough evening in the Slater house!

Ok, I gotta go get this dead fish out of the tank, say a few nice words, then flush him down the toilet.  LOL"

"event","Today was the big trip to Scott's Aunt Char and Uncle Gerry's farm.  Lorna couldn't get an 8 seater van so Jimmy stayed home so I could go.  He thought it would be good for the 4 of us to go as a family.  Ashley had told me she wanted me to go and was happy to hear I was going.

Lorna and kids showed up here about 9:30 this morning.  After installing car seats, getting coats and boots on, grabbing hats and mittens, feeding fish, turning out lights and locking up, we were finally on our way.  We made the usual stop at Tim Horton's for coffee and bagels, then we were finally on our way.  Lots of highway driving today!  Makes me a total wreck, I tells ya.  The drive home was the worst.

About half an hour into the trip Lorna realized she had just seen a sign telling us how to get to Hamilton.  Since we live in Hamilton and were coming from Hamilton a sign TO Hamilton was NOT what we were looking for.  LOL  Somehow we'd gotten ourselves turned around and were heading back home!!!  It's a 90 minute drive without mistakes!  Sean and Ashley were very good during the trip out there, not too much fussing to get out of the van and walk.  Both were pretty excited at the idea of going to the farm.  

We arrived at Char & Gerry's about 11:45am.  Not really sure, since I didn't look at the clock.  We sat in the living room for a bit talking and petting the puppies.  They have 5 Jack Russell Terriers: Emma, Buster, Pepper, Tess and Jenny.  Buster is my favourite.  He is the biggest Jack Russell I have ever seen!  He's just one big muscle with legs.  Though Gerry tells us his son has one even bigger than Buster.  I'd love to see that dog!  I wasn't even there 5 minutes before I was covered in dog hair.  I looked pretty close to one of the pack.  LOL

We had lunch a little after 1pm.  After lunch Scott, Gerry, Char, Lorna, Brandon and myself sat around the dining room table talking some more, while Brittany, Ashley and Sean played in the barn and outside feeding carrots to the horses.  About 4pm Scott, Brandon and I finally ventured outside to check out the animals.  We took a brief tour of the barn with the kids.  Sean loves animals but is a little scared of them so I held his hand the whole way and all was well with him.  We saw some pretty funny looking goats that had Sean giggling.  Scott took a whole bunch of pictures, some of which I will eventually have up on the web.  

We weren't out too long before we all got tired of the cold and came back inside.  More sitting around talking.  We left about 5:30pm and made our way to the Rainforest Cafe, which was not far from the highway on our way home.  It's a pretty neat place with ""rain"" in some spots (water dripping from the ceiling), trees, plants and animals everywhere.  Huge butterflies on the wall flapping their wings, elephants that make a bunch of racket and shake their heads, gorrilla's that shake trees.  Every so often the lights go dim, the thunder roars and the animals go nuts.  The kids loved it.  Scott got some pictures there too.

After dinner we took a little detour (you can't really call it getting lost, since we pretty much knew where we were and where we had to go, we just had a hard time getting there! lol) and finally made it home at almost 9:30pm.  It was a very long day for our kids and I think we'll pay for it tomorrow.

Lorna, Brandon and Brittany left about 10pm.  Scott, Ashley and Sean went to bed and I got to work on putting some photos on Webshots.  The links to the most recent photos are:  http://community.webshots.com/album/248167535SmSWDw and http://community.webshots.com/album/248195893jUneua/0   If there are no photos there when you click on the links, try again later.  Webshots may not have updated the page yet.

It is now almost 1am.  It's been a long day and I'm tired.  I'd like to get a little reading in before bed so I'm off now...if I forgot anything I'll have to do an update tomorrow.  :)"

We got a new goldfish last night.  I had to go to the grocery store, and the pet store is right beside it so I decided to stop in and get another fish.  It just wasn't right having only 3 fish in the tank.  We needed a Daddy Fish!  This new guy is so small compared to the others!  Especially to Mommy Fish.  The girl at the pet store said the biggest (Mommy) fish might kill the new and smallest (Daddy) fish.  They've been together over 12 hours now and no fish have been killed so I think we're safe.  I just love these little guys!  I had no idea having fish would be so much fun.  I'm trying to talk Scott into buying a bigger tank.  These fish need more room...and I need more fish!  lol  I told him I want a new tank for my birthday but he made no indication that that was even a possibility.  

I talked to Lorna last night.  She couldn't get an 8 seater van for the trip on Sunday.  They don't rent them.  They do rent SUV's that seat 8, but they need 2 weeks notice.  So, it looks like I'll be staying home this Sunday.  I was starting to like the idea of going, too.  Doesn't that just figure!   Lorna said she is leaving her house at 9am.  That's fine for my gang but I don't know what Uncle Jimmy will think about it.  If he decides not to go, I'll be his stand-in.  Otherwise Sunday will be a nice quiet day by myself.  That sounds nice too.  :)"

"event","Yep, another hamster has passed on.  Unlike Seymore I, this guy didn't look sick at all and I was quite surprised when I went to clean his cage yesterday and found him dead.  He was ""sleeping"" in the top of the cage, so I grabbed it and pulled it out of the book shelf for easier access to the top door.  I was going to put him in his ball while I cleaned his home.  When he didn't move a muscle I knew he was dead.  Usually just going near the cage woke him up.   I took him into the kitchen and put him on the table, opened up the door and we all took a good look at him.  Ashley said she wasn't going to cry.  Then she said ""I'm glad he's dead 'cause he bit me!""  He bit her the other day when she was carrying him around.  That was the one and only time he bit anyone and I think she had scared him.  A minute later she was crying.  She kept saying how she loved Seymore and missed him and how she wants another hamster.  Sean didn't cry, instead he looked like he was trying to look sad.  LOL    I cleaned the cage and put it back in it's spot on the book shelf.  We told the kids maybe in a few weeks we'd get something else.  Maybe another hamster, maybe something different.  I told Scott I'd really love a hedgehog!  LOL

Before cleaning the cage I cleaned out the fish tank.  It really needed it!  Ew!  The last time the tank was cleaned and all fresh water was added the tetra fish died.  After dealing with Seymore's death I hoped we wouldn't wake up to 3 dead fish.  Ashley would freak!  Thankfully, all 3 fish are alive and well this morning.

We woke up to a light dusting of snow on the ground outside.  Of course the kids were very excited.  There isn't really enough to play in, and it might not be there this afternoon but they still love that it's there for now.  Yesterday the temperature was a fair bit above zero, today we get snow.  Go figure.  This past year has been the craziest weather I can remember.  I'm already thinking about summer, and hoping this summer is warmer and sunnier than last year.  We've already ordered our Ontario Place season passes.  Scott also has a Canada's Wonderland season pass.  There was some mix-up and his sister only ordered 1, instead of 1 for each of us.  They were on sale cheap, which is the only reason we wanted them.  We were going to try to get away a few times just the 2 of us over the summer, maybe have my Mum watch the kids for the day.  I'm pissed at not having my own pass...but I also kind of feel like that's just my luck.  Overlooked, unappreciated...ok, so I have issues with this little mistake.  LOL  I'm not placing blame anywhere because I don't know exactly what went wrong but I am pissed.  And I'll leave it at that because I could go on and on and probably not make much sense.  LOL

Yesterday Ashley came home from school with a letter asking us to donate money to UNICEF for the victims of the tsunami.  Ashley knew a bit about what happened, apparently they talked about it in school.  Scott told her a bit more, tried to explain to her that there are a lot of people dead and a lot of people without homes, food, family, the things they love.  He then asked her if she'd like to donate her own money.  Her and Sean had about 10 bucks and change altogether, in their piggy banks.  She said that was a great idea.  Then Scott said ""Or, you could buy candy with it.""  She then wanted to buy candy.  LOL  Scott explained that these kids in Asia didn't have candy and how Mommy, Daddy and Aunt Lorna buy her candy all the time and she doesn't need her money for that.  She finally decided to donate her money to a better cause.  Sean had no opinion on the subject and couldn't care less what we did with his half of the money.  LOL  So, they are each donating $5.  Scott threw in another $10 from him and I.  $30 seems like so little, but every little bit helps I suppose.  If each student were to bring in $30 that would be a whole hell of a lot of money!   And, it says that the funds collected by January 11th will be matched, dollar for dollar, by the Canadian government.  I imagine, in the end, it will be a pretty large donation.

Ok, it's almost 10:30am and I should really go get dressed and start my day already!  Ashley is already bugging for lunch!  She must be going through a growth spurt 'cause she seems to be eating a fair amount these days."

"event","Yeah, I'm getting pretty good at this, aren't I?  Too bad my life isn't more exciting...  ;)

Finally finished reading Richard Laymon's Blood Games a few hours ago.  The last 2 or 3 chapters were exciting, but not worth the 30 chapters or nothing I had to get through first.  Ugh.  Put this one in the ""Never to be read again"" or ""Never recommend this book"" pile.  Or both.  :)  I usually enjoy Laymond's books.  This was a disappointment.  I have another Laymon book here to read but I can't remember the name of it right now.

I've already started Sue Grafton's ""G"" Is For Gumshoe.  I'm sure I'll fly through this one.  I love her writing and Kinsey Milhone in an enjoyable character.  Usually only takes me a couple days to read one of these.  I'll be getting to that when I'm done here.

Earlier this evening, while trying to read some of that Laymon book, and right after dinner (with a full tummy) I fell asleep on the couch.  I don't know how long I was out.  Well, I was out off and on.  It was a nice kind of nap.  Anyways, I was out for at least an hour, I guess.  I remember drifting off to the sounds of Scott in the kitchen clearing the table and stacking plates and silverware in the sink.  I thought he was just cleaning it up for me, getting it ready for me to do the dishes later.  I thought that was pretty decent of him.  Well, when I finally got my ass out of bed he was just finishing up the dishes!!  Does that guy rock or what!?  Later, when I asked him why he did them he said he didn't know.  He HATES doing dishes.  Weird.  Wonder what I did to deserve that?  I hope I figure it out soon and do it again.  Often.  LOL

I put up some more pictures on my Webshots page.  If anyone reading this is interested the link is:  http://community.webshots.com/user/dkslater 

My other two albums are: http://community.webshots.com/user/deanna_slater and http://community.webshots.com/user/deannaslater if anyone wants to check out some older photos of us.

Ashley's first day back to school went well.  She brought home a couple of things she made before Christmas break.  Sean spent the afternoon in his room watching Ice Age and Toy Story.  When Ashley got home she went right to her room and watched a Spongebob dvd.  Surprisingly she didn't fall asleep.  It was weird trying to get back into the routine.  It seemed like a lot longer than 2 weeks that her, and Scott, were home.  Not in a bad way.  LOL  I wasn't in any rush to get her back in school.  I kind of enjoyed staying home and lounging around the house in my pj's.  I think I went 5 whole days without leaving the house!  No, wait, that sounds like too many....  Oh!  I think it was actually 6 days!  LOL  I don't remember leaving the house after Christmas Eve when I went to the corner store for salt of all things, or before New Years' Eve when I went to the grocery store for some much needed items.  Yeah, Christmas break was nice!  LOL

Scott says things at work are really busy these days. They have more than tripled their production.  Lots of temps trying to help get the job done and lots of overtime.  He says he's working Saturday, and then Sunday is the big trip to his Aunt's farm in Uxbridge (near Toronto, I think).  We are renting an 8 seater van so we can all go.  ""All"" being Scott, myself and the kids, Uncle Jimmy, Lorna, Brandon and Brittany.  I haven't yet decided if I'll go, but I probably will.  Might be a good time!  And there is always the stop at Tim Horton's for coffee and an onion bagel with cream cheese to look forward to, if nothing else.  ;)  

Ok, it's getting late and I'm cutting into my reading time sitting here so I think I'm done for now.  :)"

Finding it hard to get my ass into gear this morning.  I've had 2 cups of tea and I still don't feel awake enough to do anything.  LOL

The kids have been surprisingly quiet so far this morning, though it looks like that is about to change.  These kids fight and argue over everything and usual start as soon as they're out of bed.  They even argue over what they've argued about!

Scott had a hard time getting to sleep last night.  I always worry about him when he has nights like that.  I don't like him working on little sleep.  Though he has worked in more dangerous places, there is still a risk there.  Maybe I'm worried he'll fall in a kettle of sauce, or something.  LOL

Last night I caught the last hour or so of that movie Win A Date With Tad Hamilton.  I enjoyed what I saw of it and would like to see it again from the beginning.

Got a bunch of reading done last night but still not finished that damn book.  It is a big book and way too slow for a Laymon book.  I think next I'll read Sue Grafton's ""G"" is for Gumbshoe.  She's always a quick read.

Ok, I've put this off long enough.  Guess it's time to go get *something* done around here.  So much to do...where do I start!?"

Didn't get up till sometime after Noon.  Lorna, Brandon and Brittany were here till sometime past 2am last night.  We played a couple board games (Buzz Word, Tabboo, Pictionary) and 2 games of our new Family Feud dvd.  Girls against the guys again, even teams this time with Uncle Jimmy playing also.  We played 6 games in total, the guys winning only 2.  Girls rule!!  LOL  I was not tired at all, having slept all day yesterday, so I didn't get to sleep till almost 6am.

Last night, about 4am, I went to feed the goldfish and found one dead.  We had 4, Mommy, Daddy, Ashley & Sean.  Creative names, eh?  ;)  Daddy fish was floating belly up.  I left him there for the kids to find in the morning.  I wasn't there when they found him but when I woke up they didn't seem to broken up over it.  It's funny how we got our first hamster, Seymore, to teach the kids about death.  He died and we got another one who we named Seymore the Second, then he was Seymore 2, and now he's just Seymore.  The first Seymore is now referred to as Dead Seymore.  Then we get 2 tetra fish that both died the same day and replaced them with 4 goldfish.  We started out teaching them about death but may have ended up confusing them.  Maybe we are giving them the idea you can just get a new ""whatever"" when one dies.  LOL

A few months ago when Scott's Dad died I told the kids.  I said ""Grandpa Yukon died last night.""  Ashley looked sad for a second then made some comment about getting another one.  LOL  I told her it doesn't really work that way with people.  I'm sure she understands that but I'm not sure Sean does.

I just realized that we never got a picture of all 4 fish.  That's a bummer, would've liked to have that.  Maybe I'll get a picture of the remaining 3 (after I've cleaned the tank!) before they die on us.  I can't decide whether to wait till they all die before getting more, or go to the pet store and get a new Daddy fish.  I love these fish!  I didn't realize how much I liked fish until I got these guys.  The little tetra fish were awful.  They did nothing and were too small to really see their faces.  These goldfish are huge and very active and crack me up all the time.  You can see their faces, bludging eyes and fish lips...I find myself watching them way too often.  

It's almost 6pm here but it feels so much later.  Our house is still a disaster from Christmas.  So much junk and no where to put it.  Scott called a place about selling our baby clothes, we've got over 5 years worth of close in boxes in closets taking up space.  We are NOT having any more kids (though with my luck I'll find myself pregnant after getting rid of everything) and it is time to start getting rid of the old and making way for the new.  Scott looks around at all the ""junk"" we've collected over the years and is thoroughly disgusted.  He would like to go back to the old days when we had nothing.  LOL  Um, no thanks.  Though I do admit that we have a bit too much stuff.  Both of us have a hard time parting with things.  Wouldn't be so bad if we had another garage, since the one we have is already pretty full.  Good thing we don't have a car to put in there!  That would never work.  lol

Sean is in the tub playing and I'll have to go wash him up in just a few minutes.  Then it's Ashley's turn.  Only an hour and a half left until bed time.  YAY!  It has been a nice 2 weeks off from the daily routine but I'm also kind of looking forward to things getting back to ""normal""...whatever that is.  ;)

Have I mentioned I'm reading Blood Games by Richard Laymon?  I'm finding it slow going.  Seems to me a whole lot of nothing happened until about the middle of the book.  Now I'm looking forward to finishing it and hope to do that tonight or tomorrow.  It's a library book and I have 3 others to finish before they're due in about 2 weeks.  I have so many books to read it's sad.  I feel like I'll never get to them all.

Speaking of books, that's another thing I've been holding on to when maybe I shouldn't.  I'm thinking of getting rid of some, maybe selling them on amazon or taking them to a local used book store.  Sounds like a pain in the ass to me but there is no way I'd throw them out!!  You just don't do that to books!  And we could use a few extra bucks....that we'd probably use to buy more junk to take up space in the house!  LOL  It never ends....

Anyways, off to wash the boy...."

I spent the first day of the new year sleeping.  LOL  Got up about an hour ago.  Don't I feel like a lazy bones!

Last night Lorna, Brandon and Brittany came over.  Ashley and Sean stayed up until about 9:30pm.  I was thinking about letting them stay up till midnight but they were both tired and cranky.  They watched Cinderella and Sean was just nodding off at the end so it was obviously bed time for him.  He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow and Ashley shortly after that.  

Once the kids were in bed we got out the cheese & crackers and stuff and pigged out.  Then we got out the jello shooters Lorna made when she got here and had a go at those.  12 were orange jello and vodka, 12 were orange jello and peach schnapps.  I thought I'd have one, but since there were two different kinds I had to have one of each.  That was a task, let me tell you.  The vodka was awful but the peach schnapps not so bad.  I tried drinking some Mike's Hard Lemonade but that didn't go down so well.  I think I got through about half the bottle. LOL  Scott, kind soul that he is, helped me out with the rest.  ;)  

At 5 minutes to midnight I downed two more shooters.  For some reason I thought I should get the drinking over with before the new year.  LOL  We turned the TV on and counted down with the folks partying in Niagara Falls.  Then we went outside with our noisemakers to disturb whatever neighbours happened to be sleeping.  Some neighbours down the street helped us.  LOL  It was a mild night and we stayed outside for a few minutes longer than necessary.  There is something about making so much noise at midnight that I just can't resist.  LOL  After that we played a game of Scene It?, guys against the girls.  Us girls kicked the guys' asses, as usual.  ;)

It was 2:30am by the time the game was done.  Lorna and Brandon headed home, Brittany stayed the night to get up with the kids while Scott and I slept.  Really nice of her to do that, I think.  I heard Scott up this morning, but he ended up back in bed.  He was drinking Vodka and water most of the night and says he has no hangover at all.  He was REALLY drunk, so it's good to see he's not suffering today.

Today is Brittany's birthday, she's now 14.  She was born at 12:40am New Years Day.  First baby born in the East end that year.  She made it into some little east end news paper.  Tomorrow is Brandon's birthday, his 16th.   Lorna and Brandon should be on their way back here soon.  Don't know what we'll do tonight, maybe play another board game.  My vote goes to Tabboo or Pictionary.  I'm really good at both. Though I can't draw a stick figure with a stencil, I still do alright.  ;)

I have no energy to do anything today, and I think that's just fine for the first day of the year.  I'm gonna continue relaxing.  I'm not ready to give it up yet.  LOL  Tomorrow will be a day of laundry and cleaning, preparing for life to return to normal come Monday.  Scott goes back to work, Ashley goes back to school and I go back to getting up way too early.  LOL  I really am a night owl.  It's hard to shake it.

I'm off to get another cup of coffee and play some online trivia on IRC.  Hope everyone had a good New Year's Eve and the best in 2005 to everyone!"

"event","LOL  Scott and I watched The Two Towers and Return of the King last night.  That's a little more than 6 hours of movie watching.  I enjoyed all 3 movies and would actually watch them again some time.  Being the lover of reading that I am, I now think I must read the books.  I've heard they are huge and hard to get through for some.  Maybe one of these days I'll track down a copy and give 'em a go.

I woke up about 9 this morning and thought I'd get out of bed at a decent time for a change and give Scott a chance to get some more sleep.  Great guy that he is, he has been staying up late and still getting up with the kids and letting me sleep.  So, today is his day to catch up on some rest.  I could get very few hours of sleep and be up very early but still stay up until the early hours of the morning.  Scott, on the other hand, could sleep 12 hours and still be ready for bed by 8pm.  LOL  Must be the curse of getting up for work at 3am every weekday for the past 3 or 4 years.

It looks like Lorna, Brandon and Brittany will be coming here tonight.  Lorna has been wanting to do some Jello shooters.  Scott can help her out with that.  I don't think I'd get more than 1 down.  LOL  Scott bought me some Mike's Hard Lemonade, which I just found out about last night so I might give those a go.  I'm not much of a drinker, I really don't like the taste of any alcohol at all, but I've heard that these things are pretty good.  We'll see.  I'll probably only get 2 of those down, but add that to the 1 jello shooter and the fact that I'm not a drinker at all, I should have a nice buzz tonight!  LOL

I think the plan for tonight is to hang out in the living room playing board games and listening to music.  Sounds perfect to me!  New Year's Eve parties are never as good as I think they'll be, and I'm too cheap to pay a babysitter anyways.  LOL  If Lorna and kids don't end up coming over it'll just be Scott and I, probably watching more movies.  I'd really like to get watching that Scream trilogy.

Scott goes back to work Monday.  Ashley goes back to school Monday.  Life returns to ""normal"" Monday.  I don't like Mondays!  LOL

Oh, my Mum actually came over yesterday.  I was surprised to see her.  She doesn't like to be out too late in the day and it was almost 2pm when she showed up, I think.  But, it was good to see her.  Unless she comes over on my birthday in less than a month (my 30th.  Eeek!) then I probably won't see her for a while."

Tuesday night we watched The Life And Death of Peter Sellers that I taped off the movie network.  Weird little film but interesting and enjoyable enough.  After that we watched a few episodes of Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica, that I neglected to mention when listing all my dvd's the other night.  Ooops!  lol  I really do love it.  I'm totally hooked on that show.  I've only seen one season 1 but a bunch of season 2 so it's good I got season one for Christmas.  You could probably call that show my guilty pleasure IF I felt guilty about watching it, which I don't.  LOL

After Nick & Jessica we watched a bit of The Man Show, which is totally lame.  But I'm not a ""man"" so maybe that's why I don't care for it.  I thought it only fair though.  Scott sat through a bunch of Nick & Jessica crap with me, I could watch girls on trampolines with him.  LOL

Last night we watched The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring.  We borrowed the dvd (all 3 actually) off Lorna because Scott has been wanting to see them.  I had absolutely NO interest.  Zero.  Zip.  Zilch!  I wasn't even going to watch with Scott last night but then I got to thinking how everyone and their mother has seen these things and I couldn't be the only left out.  So, I watched it and I quite enjoyed it!!  LOL  I was surprised at how interested I was and how when it was done I found myself wanting more.  I think we're watching The Two Towers tonight.  I'm looking forward to that!

It was 1am when the movie was over.  Scott had a shower and I did some reading.  He joined me with a book of his own and we read till about 2:45am.  I was reading Blood Games by Richard Laymon, which got off to a real slow start but is starting to pick up now and I can't wait to pick it up each day.  Scott started reading Private Parts.  I'll probably read that also, whenever he's finished.

I had a hard to getting to sleep again last night, and laying there listening to Scott snore never helps.  lol  Finally I got to sleep somewhere around 3:30am.  I woke up about 9 this morning but couldn't bring myself to get out of bed so I went back to sleep and Scott woke me at 12:30pm-ish.  Ahhh, I love when he's on vacation!  lol

Tomorrow is New Year's Eve and I still have no idea what is going on, if anyone is coming over or not.  I do know that one of us will have to brave the cold outdoors and get to a store very soon!  We're almost out of Pepsi, smokes and toilet paper!  LOL

My Mum was supposed to come for a visit...it's after 1pm and no sign of her.  It's not looking likely she'll show up.  By the time she gets her Christmas gifts we'll be able to give them to her for her birthday...in July!!!  LOL"

Another Christmas over, anyways.  This makes Christmas number 15 for Scott and I.  Hard to believe sometimes.  

We all were insanely spoiled this year.  Both kids got tv's and dvd players for their bedrooms.  Some people think it is insane for a 3 and 5 year old to have their own tv/dvd players but I'm really looking forward to them watching their movies in their rooms while I watch ""Mommy and Daddy shows"" in the living room.  The tv is mine again!!  Muahahaha  The tv's were from Uncle Jimmy, the dvd players from Grandma and Grandpa.  They also each got a new bike from Aunt Lorna.  We got a ton of snow a few days before Christmas, and a whole bunch more the day after Christmas so there will be no bike riding for these two for a while.  It is supposed to warm up a bit in the next few days.  If all this snow melts I'll let 'em try their bikes out outside.  For now they will have to be happy with the little ride they took up and down the hallway!  They also got a couple board games (Crocodile Dentist and Mouse Trap), some clothes, a couple dvd's, a couple video games (the kind you plug right into the tv) and some other useless junk that we'll be stepping on for the next few weeks.  LOL

Between Scott and I, we now have just about enough dvd's to open our own store!  lol  Scott gave me seasons 6, 7 and 8 of Friends, season 2 and 3 of Will & Grace.  I gave him season 1 and 2 of Ren & Stimpy, A Fish Called Wanda and season 4 of The Simpsons.  Jimmy gave him season 1 and 2 of The Man Show and me An Evening With Kevin Smith, which almost completes my collection.  Just need Jersey Girl, I think.  ;)  Lorna gave him 2 more movies: Wild At Heart and Scrooged.  She gave me the complete set of Scream which is very cool.  She also gave me a Buddy Christ dashboard statue, which you Kevin Smith fans will know from the movie Dogma.  VERY cool.  The kids got a new Spongebob dvd, Mighty Machines and season 2 of the Flintstones.  I think that is all.  lol  It looks like a huge collection of dvd's sitting under our tree.  Scott also got me a 4 slice toaster which I wanted and Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas which I've been dying to read.  I got him a pair of comfy flannel pants for hanging around the house, some more work socks and Howard Stern's Private Parts book, which he asked for.

I know I got a bunch of other stuff but I can't remember right now and it really isn't important.  Christmas went very well this year, I think.  It didn't really ""feel"" like Christmas, and Scott was very much NOT in the Christmas spirit this year, but it still went pretty well.

As of right now we have no plans for New Year's Eve.  We'll probably be doing the same thing we did last year, sitting on the couch watching tv.  lol  I actually had to wake Scott up at midnight.  Wished him a happy new year and off to bed he went.  I'm hoping he'll be up at the stroke of midnight this year.  He's been on vacation since the 22nd and has been staying up later than usual so he should make it to midnight.  Maybe Lorna, Brandon and Brittany will come over and we'll play board games or pool.  I don't know what their plans for New Year's are yet.  Lorna keeps talking about jello shooters...I told her Scott could help her out with those.  I have no interest, being the non-drinker that I am.  The kids were up till almost midnight the other night, so I know it is possible for them to stay up that late, I just don't know if I want them to.  LOL  Might just put them to bed at their usual time.  I don't think I'm ready for them to be up that late celebrating with us.  We shall see, I guess.

I've been pondering some New Year's resolutions.  I hate making them because I never keep them, so what's the point?  The one thing I am planning on is quitting smoking.  I've done it before, for 7 months.  I'm sure I could do it again, but I do enjoy smoking.  Yeah, yeah, I know it's bad for me.  I still enjoy it!!!  I would like to spend less time on the computer and more time keeping in touch with family and friends in the coming year.  And keeping my journal up to date.  I am really awful with that.  I'm still not sure about this online journal stuff.  I might just end up abandoning it altogether...."

I have been busy doing cross-stitch every night for weeks now!  Christmas cross-stitch, that is.  I have one last piece to finish and send off then it's all done for another year!  I enjoy doing it, but get annoyed when it takes to long to complete them all.  Especially when it get so close to Christmas.

Today we are going to Ashley's school to watch them all (Kindergarten to grade 5) perform a Christmas show.  Should be fun.

Got an email from my friend Stephanie the other day.  Her and her husband went to see Kevin Smith somewhere in Toronto.  I can't remember the name of the place now.  The guy talked for 4 straight hours!  She said he was his usual funny self and it was a great night.  Scott and I both would've liked to go but didn't want to spend the $100 for tickets.  Especially so close to Christmas, not a good idea.

I have been totally slacking in the online photos department.  Ugh.  I got a program that will do batch resizing of photos to make it easier, and Webshots is real easy to use, yet I still don't do it.  Go figure.  I should update them soon, before we take a ton of Christmas pictures.

I started reading Trauma by Graham Masterton 2 days ago.  It's a fairly small book and I should've been done by now but I just haven't been spending the time reading that I used to.  Too much cross-stitch to do!  LOL"

"event","Yep, that's right, I went and got myself an online journal.  What was I thinking?  Am I really going to keep this thing updated?  I dunno...probably not.  But hey, it's here if I want it.

I'm hoping this will be the place where I go to tell the world what's going on with me and my family.  Nothing personal, no need to share that with the world, but the fun and exciting stuff.  But, since my life lacks fun and excitement most of the time, this place will probably be pretty empty!  LOL

I have nothing exciting to add at the moment...though I may be back later to talk about our exciting visit to Ashley's classroom yesterday.  I must be going for now...Those dishes in the sink won't do themselves!"

"event","Yay peeps... I'm back in kdrama Lala Land<br /><br />So much of choices that left me undecided on which I would love to focus on especially after Playful Kiss. So Ding Ding Ding and we have a winner here... I have found my new drug to keep me addicted to Kdrama. It's Secret Garden, airing on SBS on Saturday-Sunday slot. Why? <br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);""><strong>Secret Garden </strong></span><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/000c2g1h/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 225px; height: 207px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/000c2g1h/s320x240"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/000c3fka/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 207px; height: 207px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/000c3fka/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);""><strong>The Plot</strong></span><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/000c4d11/""><img border=""0"" alt="""" style=""width: 520px; height: 211px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/000c4d11/s320x240"" /></a><br />Body swapping between lead characters, how can you say no to that? Although we've been told with the main plot quite early on but I just love the introduction of the characters leading to that body swapping twist. It was done quite subtly not just for the sake of introducing all characters in the show. The flow was just right and for the first time I feel so confident to say that this is one hell of a gem that I'm desperately seeking out in this year. After the disappointment of Coffee House and My Girlfriend is A Gumiho, I might say that this is promising to be the best Kdrama for the year. I'd hope I'm right. coz the feeling was so right and I even get shivers just by Hyun Bin's stare. <br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);""><strong>Kim Joo Won - Hyun Bin</strong></span><br />What can I say? He's cold, he's rich, he's sarcastically funny, selfish and too into himself, yeah you could say he's the typical male lead character we found in Kdrama, but I have to stop you right there. He is the most interesting male lead character I have known so far coz not only he's a chaebol, but he comes with an excess bagage; a weirdly challengely fashion sense and total whacked-nut-job for his own fear and unusual taste in women. He's so interestingly to hate but love to adore. Especially when he keeps thinking about GRI and continue to fantasize about her; the most notable scene is when he was totally surprised when the hallucinated GRI talk to him back, I was laughing till I cry.<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);""><strong>Gil Ra Im - Ha Ji Won</strong></span><br />Wew... I never been so attracted to a female before in my life. Cool is not even a word to describe her. And I totally get why KJW is overly smitten by her presence. HJW is really an amazing actress. Not only she portrays the character to be so slick, cool and hi-chic but also girlish and vulnerable like any normal girl would be. I&nbsp;just love her. <br /><br />My weekends would never been the same. <br /><img alt="""" src=""http://ent.cqnews.net/ylove/201011/W020101116352972533116.jpg"" /><br /><br />p/s : That sparkling tracksuit really makes me giggle each time.

"event","Hi hi friends...<br /><br />Just dropping by a while...<br />I'm having withdrawal symptoms of Playful Kiss... thankfully tomorrow its YT episode time... wakaka<br />So in the mean time here I go... <br />I also post my thoughts on Soompi thread.<br /><br /><strong>My quick sum-up on PK vs ISWAK/TKA vs INK vs Anime</strong><br />1. Anime is still the best series. PK comes in second. INK third and ISWAK/TKA would be last, sorry (&gt;.&lt;)<br />2. Jung So-Min plays the best Kotoko.<br />3. Takashi Kashiwabara plays the best Naoki. Sorry KHJ, u came in 3rd after Joe Cheng. <br />4. Superb casting is by far PK is the best. From main to supporting, all are eye-candy and great. Why? Keep reading.<br />5. The best mom is indeed PK. Not annoying just lovable to hate.<br />6. The best Yuuki is also PK. Cute like in anime. <br />7. The best Kinnosuke is again from PK. I never felt sympathy for this guy, yet in PK I do. <br />8. The best best-friend (Jinko and Satomi) yet again, must I say PK?<br />9. The best dads for both Naoki and Kotoko. Hmm actually its a tie. I like INK&nbsp;and PK. <br />10. The best Reiko, raise ur hands with me if u say PK. She is funny and likes to tease Oh Hani.<br />11. The best Sudou is of coz Mr 40. Haha I really like him. Funny hair flip. <br />12. The best house set-up, PK of coz. That window, it's really is something. <br />13. The best comedy. INK&nbsp;is over-the-top. Anime is cartoonish. ISWAK/TKA bleh. So I think PK is the best. The chicken hood? LOL<br />14. The most letdown scene - The scoreboard-exam revelation day. Come on! What?! A graph chart?!<br />15. The most heartfelt moment - The practice wedding walk by Oh Hani and dad.<br />16. The most meaningful moment - The swing scene between Joon-Gu and Oh Hani.<br />17. The most giddy moment - Too many to say in here, LOL<br />18. The most mixed feeling scene (love&amp;hate) - Car kissing scene. Its too dark and I can't see them. Bleh...<br />19. The most hateful scene - The scoreboard. I still hate it, coz that's the essence of their relationship. The beginning. <br />20.&nbsp;The most loveable scene - When Oh Hani finds Baek Seung-jo waiting for her for their date. His look is full of love. <br />21. The best twist from manga - Baek Seung-jo kept looking at Oh Hani during their first breakfast. OMG that was HOT!!!<br />22. The most satisfying scene - The look on Baek Seung-jo after Oh Hani's kiss attack on their wedding day. LOL <br />23. The best episode? - I'd say Episode 15, keke... yeah bcoz of the wedding n honeymoon baby!<br />24. The worst episode? - I'd say the first. It fail to capture audience, if I was new to the INK franchise.<br />25. So I think it's best to say that PK&nbsp;is the best live-action adaptation. Anime just stay on-top of the crops coz it represent the whole essence from manga briefly. <br /><br />Note : PK : Playful Kiss l ISWAK : It Started With A Kiss l TKA : They Kiss Again l INK :&nbsp;Itazura Na Kiss<br /><br /><br />"

"event","It's good to be back...<br />I had a rough year and finally I can be online from day to day basis now... It's been a while since I've been here as I'd set my priority much more towards my responsibilty in real life than virtually. To those who know me for what I used to be, I'm no longer active as subbers but just being a fan... I wish I could but I have to put my feet on the ground just let it all be. It's time.<br /><br />Currently I just enjoy whatever I can and just relaxed...<br /><br /><strong>MOVIEs</strong><br /><strong>The A-Team</strong> - Super hillariously funny and OTP actions. My favourite moment is when they're trying to fly the tank. Its EPIC.<br /><strong>Predators</strong> - Awesome classic. Can't wait for it's sequel. Keke<br /><strong>Liar Game the Movie</strong> - I really loved it. A mind boggling of lies and deception. Totally awesome. <br /><br /><strong>DRAMAs </strong><br />I'm more into watching dramas now and I'm watching K-drama <strong>Playful Kiss</strong> and J-Drama <strong>GM&nbsp;Odore Doctor</strong>. Both I really like and kind of addictive actually, LOL<br /><br /><strong>Granado Espada (GE)</strong><br />I'm playing a little GE, since I can afk (away-from-keyboard) and still playing. I'm playing under <strong>Rembrandt</strong> server under the name <strong>Desequilibrio</strong> (Imbalance in Spanish) <strong>familly</strong>. My family level currently is 35 consisting of 43 characters. <br /><br /><strong>Masters</strong> - Bernelli, Grandice, Romina, Baihu<br /><strong>Experts</strong> - Emilia The Sage (ETS), Catherine Summoner, Catherine (STR)<br /><strong>Veterans</strong> - Fighter, Musketeer, Wizard, Elementalist, Scout, Edward, Adelina Esparanza, Lorch, <br /><strong>100</strong> - Claude, Idge Imbruglia, Karjalaine, Viki, Angie, Andre, Emilia The Reckless (ETR)&nbsp;and Catherine (Torsche) <br /><strong>&gt;100</strong> - Adelina The Pirate (ATP) x 2, Soho The Wind (STW), Idge Battlesmith (IBS), Brunnie, Panfilo, Auch Infantry, Reboldeux Soldier, Coimbra Trooper, Gavin, Selva, Nar, Ania, Helena, Jack, Calyce, Claire, Irawan, Lisa,<br /><br /><strong>KANJANI8</strong><br />And also I try to keep an update with what eito are doing and I see that they're doing great with new albums and even a MOVIE! Wow, that really threw me off the chart! Amazing, guys! Finally the spotlight has coming down on you! And what your longtime dream had finally come true. I can't wait to watch it with sub ^^<br /><br /><strong>REAL&nbsp;LIFE vs SUBBING&nbsp;WORK</strong><br />I finally settle means that I can juggle real life with my addiction to surf virtually here and there. Since now I have a stable connection, I'd rather say that my staying here is only a watcher and just being a fan. I wish I could do more with subbing and involved more in eitokickass but I need to be realistic and wouldn't want to burden others if I may get in their way."

I want to shoot them up.. hehehe I'm sick of having another audit after another.. sigh...  <br /><br />And now its management meeting for financial year...  <br />Since I'm in HR, yes my life is a living hell... <br />Busy in appraisal and collection of data...  <br /><br />Anyway, with the recent event happening in eka, I got a little carried away and really angry towards the action of re-uploading to youtube. So, here's what I thought if I was in the culprit shoes.. just playing<br /><br />  <lj-cut><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">1) WHO ARE YOU TO FEEL ANGRY FOR? IT'S NOT YOUR VIDEO ANYWAY...</span> <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Yes. If it's not ours then it certainly not yours too. Then, why do you want to upload? Let's say you're right. Let's say that we shouldn't be angry because of this. Then, please dont be angry if we decide not to share any of our subbing anymore. We have nothing to lose. We're subbing for our own sake and friends. Since the copyright issue in Asia is still not as strict as in certain parts of the world, we thought we could take that advantage and share it with everybody under certain ruled community. By uploading to youtube and other sites, these rules might bite us in the end. We dont want that to happen. Called us paranoid, whatever... but we are aware of this unwanted scenarios. Do you?</span> <br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong> </strong>2) HUH, CLAIMING THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC BUT WHY LOCK THE COMMUNITY? </span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">I'M DOING THESE OUTSIDERS A FAVOUR!!</span> <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">The terms locked community is only for outsiders who are not belong to our community. Whether because they didnt know about us or chose not to join us coz they  didn't feel the needs to follow our request. So, as far as I'm concerned, our releases it is considered public. A favour for an outsider is to have them join the community and they can start sharing</span>.   <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><br /><br />3) YOUTUBE OR OTHER STREAMING SITES WILL FURTHER PROMOTE MORE FANS... WHY ARE U AGAINST THIS 'HOLY&quot; ACTION?</span> <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">If your intention for uploading is to promote, wow you'e the most loyal fans out there arent you? Having the time and energy to upload the files rather than promoting our community instead. If you really want to upload, please use the right way in the first place. Ask for permission. </span>  <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><br /><br />4) PERMISSION? WHY DO I NEED TO ASK? YOU WILL REJECT ME FOR SURE!!</span> <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Yes, since we already stated firmly in the very beginning that uploading is not allowed. We're very SORRY to reject your request even when you already know that we are strongly against it. Yes, nobody likes rejection. So as we when you reject our rules and still want to upload</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">. I guess the feeling is mutual. </span>  <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><br /><br />5) THEN WHAT THE HECK, I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.. I CAN UPLOAD AS MANY VIDEOS I WANT...</span> <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">Hmmm, if you think like that, then what can we do? So keep doing what you're doing. Don't worry, we wil do our part as well. We'lll keep track and take down any uploaded videos which relates to us. You can count on that. </span>  <br /><br />p/s : Did I play that role? Hahaha... kinda like Dr Jeckyll and Mrs Hyde there.. hope that may be we'll understand on their perception and just what the hell  they were thinking; doing such things...<br /><br /></lj-cut>"

It's been a while... since I last visit my own LJ... yeah too long that I left my LJ empty and not updated... &gt;&lt;

Reasons that I could think of aside from my subbing works were; 
1. The holidays and festivities really gets me occupied
2. My job really piled up near to the end of year... Audit this, Audit that... Audit everywhere...
3. Granado Espada - Online game that really glued me
4. Sent my laptop for repair (replaced fan and charger) 

So it was nearly 2 weeks that I was laptopless and I realy find it hard to spend my time to do other stuffs...
 And at that moment I realized... OMG I'm really an otaku... &gt;&lt;

p/s : One of my lovely niece was infected with lice in her hair.. Funny thing is upon hearing that suddenly my head was itching and I was scratching... BUT there was none actually.. It's a normal reaction I guess... As if you can feel that there were something crawling in your hair...  FUNNY huh"

And during that hectic time,&nbsp;&nbsp;we silently excused ourselves from that HOLY&nbsp;and ELITE&nbsp;community, coz we know that we're not welcome and what we're doing is basically 'violating' their RULES (self-proclaimed by certain individuals)...<br /><br />NOW?

With recent turn of events,<strong> I&nbsp;GUESS&nbsp;IT'S&nbsp;OKAY&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;THEM&nbsp;TO&nbsp;PROMOTE.... BUT&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;US... </strong>And probably we'll hear excuses saying... Hey, it's not a promotion! It's more like an announcement... Hmmm... So, is there any difference to what we're doing back then? Yes? Oh, so it's different just because of the 12 hours or 24 hours unlock thingy? So, in our case it's called promoting? What about them? No? Oh I forgot, because of the 12 hours freedom-to-download?..

"event","Where should I begin... <br /><br />I&nbsp;prefer Terminator : Salvation although I'm really a fan of transformer but somehow as expected, the sequel, Transformer :&nbsp;Revenge of the Fallen yet again missed the mark and failed to impressed me. <br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><strong>WARNING&nbsp;:&nbsp;SPOILER!</strong></span><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""WHAT!!!! How can I say such things..."">WHAT!!!! How can I say such things...<br /><br />I know that big bang-fight-to-death scenes with Optimus dying and Megatron bullying his twin, Starscream (I honestly can't recognize him without his signature red &amp; blue colour, wonder where went wrong) I know it's not important but that tiny details actually important to a fan like me to be excited about this significant character, without the colour and also that very annoying voice, Starscream could be change name to Megadeath for all I care. Half of the movie I get tired already with this not-so-important character, the mom, the dad, the girlfriend oh not to forget the robo-girl-tounge and the idiot friend who really likes his stunt gun. Even Constructicons didn't get proper introduction... or it's just a big-fat vacuum machine? Shrieks!!! I seriously don't like what I'm seeing... I guess I like it more if they focussed more on the robots rather than the humans... BORING! I'm yawning like hell! I'm halfway on my sleep, even when the 6 primes suddenly appears. I was like, WTF?<br /><br />For terminator, I'm just at awe with the sequence. Yes, this was done brilliantly as to how they kept us engaging to Marcus, a new character which I already&nbsp; guess a skynet tool to get to John Connor but I really didn't expect to see Mr Senator in his old young bod. I seriously can recall back to his condition way back from the very first terminator. Bulky as ever and looks very young too. That kind of details really contribute to my amazement. Not to mention the ever so cool moto-terminator which I really wish to have someday!! HAHA keep on dreaming! The story is brief and simple and the scenes were done without left me so much question in the head, even the big question still makes me anticipates more and more towards the ending. Although I have to admit the scenes where Marcus was electro-resurrected was really funny but it does makes logic as to why he still remains a man in a tin body. <br /><br />Both has pros and cos, without a doubt Transformers is a BIG&nbsp;DEAL and the scenes were spectacular BUT to be better, lose the human a bit, let the autobots and decepticons really steal the light this time.</lj-cut>"

Even I'm busy with other activities during the day but at night I'm all in my room watching things that I never thought I'd be watching and I went @#%$!*&amp;^* although I did enjoy most of it..<br /><br />1. The Slingshot a.k.a The Story About A Man<br />- Never thought I'd be saying this but this show really glued me, even though I missed the episode 1&amp; 2... Superb cast and storyline... I'm not going to download it instead I'll be watching it through my regular tv... I'd like the suspense so far... afraid that if I download it, my tendency to fast-forward is very high.. no matter how great the story is... I even don't visit doramabeans... So today is episode 5...<br /><br />2. P2<br />- Ah yawning.. even how psycho the parking attendant was... but not so psycho since he had a thing for the girl.<br /><br />3. The Other Boleyn Girl<br />- How stupid people are in those days. <br /><br />4. 2 Days 1 Night - The Way Home Episode 1 <br />- As always cracked the hell out of me. How can they force those old people to play a quiz game?... Funny!!<br /><br />5. Greys Anatomy<br />- Catfights between Christina and Meredith was a fun thing to re-watched. Even funnier to see McSteamy held himself from Meredith's lil sis. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Naruto (little spoiler) "">p/s :&nbsp;Naruto story is getting a bit off... even though he is that powerful, but to playing god?

It&rsquo;s another cruel truth.&rdquo;</em> &mdash; <em>KP&rsquo;s note: We did some research, and we believe Yi Jeong says this to Ga Eul.</em><br /><br />As momentum builds for the merger of Shin-hwa Group and JK Group, Jun Pyo and Jae Gyeong go on their first date. Unfortunately, each part of the date that Jae Gyeong has planned reminds Jun Pyo of Jan Di. Jae Gyeong senses Jun Pyo&rsquo;s thoughts [of someone else] and feeling insecure, demands a kiss. Ji Hu and Jan Di are conversing on the emergency exit stairwell at the time and witness the two&hellip;&hellip;.<br /><br />When Yi Jeong comes across his father with another woman in Yi Jeong&rsquo;s own workshop, he has a big argument with his dad. In the midst of his troubled mood, vague memories of his first love Eun Jae arise. Out of her feelings for Yi Jeong, Ga Eul decides to enroll for pottery lessons. After she registers, she meets Cha Eun Jae, a student-teacher with a lovely smile.<br /><br />Although Eun Jae loved Yi Jeong when she was younger, nothing came of it because he thought she was in love with his older brother. When Yi Jeong meets her again, he finds out that she is now actually his brother&rsquo;s girlfriend. <p>Although he denied believing in a single fated love to Ga Eul, Eun Jae indirectly reveals Yi Jeong&rsquo;s true view on love and destiny. She also contributes to Ga Eul and Yi Jeong&rsquo;s growing relationship.</p> <p><strong>Updated (2/26): Unconfirmed major spoilers for episodes 17 &amp; 18<br /> </strong></p> <ul><li>Jan Di works hard at various jobs in order to help out her parents, but collapses while in front of Ji Hu at the art centre. He watches over her at her bedside, and kisses her hand.</li><li>Jun Pyo and Jae Gyeong&rsquo;s first date destination is a grocery store. At first, Jun Pyo eats alone, completely indifferent to Jae Gyeong. However, in the end, they eat together in the food court - even feeding each other!</li><li>The couple then goes to Namsan. However, thoughts of Jan Di keep rising in Jun Pyo&rsquo;s mind. Jae Gyeong sees &ldquo;Jun Pyo &hearts; Jan Di - first night&rdquo; in the cable car, and begins to piece their past together.</li><li>Due to Jun Pyo&rsquo;s continual inattention, Jae Gyeong demands that Jun Pyo proves that he likes her. This results in a kiss on campus - witnessed by Jan Di and Ji Hu.</li><li>Jun Pyo and Ji Hu meet up sometime after this happens. At that time, Ji Hu explodes on Jun Pyo and tells him the reason that Jan Di can no longer swim (- she took the blow that was meant for Jun Pyo). Finally, Jun Pyo realizes what happened.</li><li>Jan Di and Ji Hu visit a Buddhist temple and make wishes - (hers regarding university acceptance and his regarding happiness).</li><li>Assuming that Jan Di and Ji Hu&nbsp;are a couple,&nbsp;Jae Gyeong&nbsp;persuades them to go on a double date with herself and Jun Pyo. They leave for an impromptu holiday.</li><li><strong>While in the pool, Jan Di starts to sink due to a case of anemia (iron deficiency). In contrast to the manga, Jun Pyo (not Ji Hu) jumps in to save her. When Jan Di expresses surprise at Jun Pyo being able to swim, he explains about the time in New Caledonia when he could only stand by and watch as Ji Hu saved Jan Di. He says, &ldquo;I learned how to swim because I thought it&rsquo;d be easier to face drowning in water rather than watching another guy save you first again.&rdquo; Jan Di is touched by his confession, while Jae Gyeong feels miserable. As Jun Pyo carries Jan Di to [her? his?] room, Ji Hu blocks his path and takes her into his own arms.</strong></li><li>Hearing noise from the room, Jan Di goes to see if Jae Gyeong is ok. She is shocked to see Jae Gyeong unclothed, embracing Jun Pyo.

"event","Yes I'm talking about the same story. Only that each version has it's own pros and cons.&nbsp;here I just want to share my views on why I'm watching this 3 version;<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"">MG 2001</span></strong><br />The only thing that glued me to this version is Jerry Yan. Even though his acting is not that good, but he really has that aura to be Dau Ming Si. The plot line really slow and I didn't hesitate to push the forward button sometimes. But since this is the first version that I watched, to me, they really did a good job in setting the drama standard from the adapted manga. As for the chemistry in F4, the relationship between each of them is genuinely good. Each character really potrays themselves as these 4 rich brats who grew up together as friends. I mean if outside I can see them being friends. I didn't regret to collect all the series set, coz I can watch jerry Yan whenever I want hehehehe<br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">HYD 2005</span></strong> <br />I was really disappointed actually. This is not what I imagine Domyouji would be coz yes I was in the impression of Jerry Yan look-a-like. The storyline much to disappointment, doesn't work for me. Yes, they did some twist and turns but all I can say is that I prefer MG than this. The cast were, sorry to say but I think my least favourites. In a nutshell Domyouji here doesn't portrayed best by Matsu-Jun. No way near. It really gives me a headache. To make matter worse I even bought the series. Kind of regret but since I'm a collector, I guess I have to bear it then...<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);""><strong>BBF 2009</strong></span><br />To me this is a very refreshing version. Not to say that I like it entirely but seriously Lee Min-Ho is Jerry Yan's twin. I can recall certain shots that I innocently thought that he was Jerry Yan, hahaha. May be because of that I totally cast aside Matsu Jun in HYD. But still... now I'm glued to the show !!^^ Damn you Lee Min-ho aka Jerry Yan!!&nbsp;Anyway, about the storyline, I didn't say that it's the best but I really&nbsp;can say that the writers did a very good job of twisting parts of MG, HYD and the manga itself. Like I said it's refreshing. And also they cast this 4 good looking guys which I can say the best F4 ever. Can't wait to buy the series... hehehehhe<br /><br />So here are the cast of BBF;<br /><table cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" border=""0"" width=""200""><tbody><tr><td><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003tscp/""><img border=""0"" style=""width: 290px; height: 159px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003tscp/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a></td><td><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003wqa2/""><img border=""0"" style=""width: 290px; height: 159px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003wqa2/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a></td></tr><tr><td><div style=""text-align: center;"">Lee Min-ho aka Gu Jun-pyo</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">(he's Jerry Yan, right?) ^_^</div></td><td><div style=""text-align: center;"">Gu Hye-sun as Geum Jan-di</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">(like nodame, right?)</div></td></tr><tr><td><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003xbes/""><img border=""0"" style=""width: 290px; height: 159px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003xbes/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a></td><td><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003y0a7/""><img border=""0"" style=""width: 290px; height: 160px;"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/munakiut/pic/0003y0a7/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a></td></tr><tr><td><div style=""text-align: center;"">Kim Hyun-joong as Yoon Ji-hoo</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">(he's charming)</div></td><td style=""text-align: center;"">Left :&nbsp;Kim Joon as Song Woo-bin (he's cool)<br />Right : Kim Bum as So Yi-jung (cute as baby)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />If you cant wait for the video to be subbed, here is a good review made by doramabeans.<br />The latest one is&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.dramabeans.com/2009/02/boys-before-flowers-episode-12/"">episode 12 </a>.<br /><br />p/s : I love their soundtrack too ^^<br /><br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);""><strong><br /></strong></span>"

"event","Wahh it's been so long not writing here...<br /><br />As usual last night watched the crazy 2 days 1 night and yes, this time was a whole a lot of fun. Not that I didn't like them with Chan Ho, but I thought may be the guys held back a bit since they were with someone who is prominent. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_53Lh5pKBLB8/SHvGVp3MWdI/AAAAAAAAACs/JgOYTEW-ubc/s400/1n2dheader.jpg"" /><br /><br />This week they went to Beolgyo, a place known for its ark-shell (adik-beradik kerang) digging... wakaka<br />The boys were offered money so that they can eat and have a fun time at the market place for 2 hours; but the director warned them that they have to pay back by doing some kind of work. As a result;<br />Su Geun - 200,000 won<br />Ji Won - 5,000 won<br />Kim C - 30,000 won<br />Seung Gi - 30,000 won<br />Ho Dong - 10,000 won<br />MC Mong - 4,000 won<br /><br />Truthfully I was laughing hard when Su Geun asked that big amount coz, he knew what's coming, yet he dares to do it. I guess that's the true entertainment sacrifice. He really wanted to be that centre of attention. Its fun to see him spent the money on others, even at first they were reluctant coz afraid that Su Geun might use that against them later. But seriously Su Geun looked really honest about it.<span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);""> I laughed hard when MC Mong made a remark about how he look like BBF (Boys Before Flowers), then the Paradise song was played in the background....&nbsp; and I was like O_o... which boys are you talking about? NOOOO!!! It's like night and day, right?</span><br /><br /><lj-cut>Anyway, after the fun time, they boys headed back and as expected the work that they had to do is ark-shell digging. The Director mentioned that 1 piece of arkshell is equal to 100 won; so<br />Su Geun - 2,000 ark shell<br />Ji Won - 50 arkshell<br />Kim C - 300 arkshell<br />Seung Gi - 300 arkshell<br />Ho Dong - 100 arkshell<br />MC Mong - 40 arkshell<br /><br />At this moment the director was very strict in saying that they had to deliver thier work and no discount what so ever. Hearing this, <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);"">Su Geun silently marched down at the edge of the jetty and acted like he wanted to jump off. I was laughing really hard. </span>So they boys went off and started digging at the beach area. <br /><br />After certain time, the tide was rising, so they had to stop and everybody managed to get their quota... except for Su Geun; he was short 1,500 arkshells. So he was given another chance to dig, either at 2.00 am or 2.00 pm. <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);"">Hearing this, the boys jumped at it and said, &quot;You should do it at 2.00 am,&quot; and then director sensing this turn of event offered him a 33% discount. He only need to fing 1,000 pieaces instead. Then Su Geun wanted to make it more interesting,&quot; What if the loser of bokbulbok games has to accompany me?&quot; Hearing this, the boys were a bit surprised and really thought that the idea was good &amp; funny but silently they felt like O'oh... O_o</span><br /><br />So the 3 games for dinner&nbsp; this time were hide and seek, quiz and guessing matches in box. Haenam team (Su Geun, Kim C, &amp; MC Mong) team lost to Hodong team (Ho Dong,&nbsp;Seung Gi &amp; Ji Won). <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);"">Next week we'll get to see who is the lucky person to accompany Su Geun for arkshell digging at 2.00 am... wakakaka</span><br /><br />p/s : After watching this, I went to watch BBF&nbsp;again and really crazy over Lee Min-Ho ^^.

"event","Hi hi...

I just wanna share some silly story... it's about my nieces. Hahaa as I was re-watching Excite!! DVD the other day, they were interested to join with me; one is about 7 years old and the other is 5 years old. Since I'm living with them, I sometimes have to entertain them of course. Then, I asked whether they like these &quot;abang&quot;, it means brother, here is polite to call them that rather than just guys... * I really had a hard time trying to ask them this grown up questions... hahaha...

So one thing lead to another the 7 year old said that she likes the yellow coloured t-shirt, the 5 year old well she likes the light green one. And when I asked them who do you think that I like in here, the girls mentioned... the red one... hahaha right on! They are truly my nieces! HAHHAHAHA!!

Then the next day they asked if they can watch it again especially the boogie-woogie medley part (yes, coz it involves colour and lots of dance movement). And of course the eight of being silly as usual. This happens almost every night now. They would sneak up into my room and asked &quot; Can I watch 'abang' dancing again?&quot; Hahaha... 

Then after a while, I'm being the experimenting type of person, like to see whether the girls like to see other JE groups. So I let them watched JE Countdown concerts (&nbsp;I know that this is boring one but I just want them to see the latest one)... I showed them kanjani8 and they immediately recognised them... how cute! &quot;Here is dark green brother.... here is the purple one... ahhh the red brother... Why is he wearing a pin? Like a girl.&quot; then I asked them, &quot;Comel tak?&quot; meaning &quot;Cute isn't he?&quot;... and to my surprise they are nodding... hahaha They still like the boys... then HeySayJump comes into play... the girls watched and also like them coz they are being cute and all... 

Then came Arashi... They danced and as they focused on Ohno, my nieces move back a little from the screen, so I said, &quot;Why? Isn't he cute?&quot;... They are shaking their heads and I was like laughing like hell.. no offense... I didnt say that I like Arashi and I didn't say that I hate them, I simply don't have anything against them but my nieces really cracked me O_o hahaha.. then I point to Matsu Jun, they also shaked their heads... I kept laughing hard... then I point back to dark green brother (Yoko), who accidently was there and the girls nod!...&nbsp; wow !!! ... You're truly my nieces!!! HAHAHAHA

Sorry for being silly... this is just some baka stories that I think I like to share... again no offense to Arashi... may be the aura devil in OHNO&nbsp;is so strong that my nieces were afraid of them.... 

p/s : the dark green brother... is cute. ^^ I like the curly hair. Red with pin, even cuter. Hehehee"

The game was EAT&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;BUN. The twist was you have to swallow down no matter what kind of filling you got. (A range of 'wonderful' fiery spice, mustard to normal beans paste and vegetable fillings). If you spit it out then you'll lose and have to sleep outside! LOL. The result was...<br /><br />Ji Won - bean paste; sleep in<br />MC Mong - vegetable; sleep in<br />Kim C - bean paste; sleep in<br />Ho Dong - fiery spice; sleep out <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);"">(He spitted out after trying to swallow, funny as hell)</span><br />Seung Gi - fiery spice; sleep out<span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);""> (He can't even swallow the first bite)</span><br />Su Geun - fiery spice, sleep out <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);"">(He swallowed the first bite but can't continue, drank milk dated 4 Nov, LOL)</span><br />Chan Ho - mustard, sleep out <span style=""color: rgb(51, 204, 204);"">(He spitted out without even trying)</span><br /><br />Then Chan Ho shared with the boys his hardship while playing in overseas.

"event","Hi hi... (yawn)
It's been a while since I wrote here. Nothing much has happened, not like that my life is boring, is just that I'm now looking for something else to cure my boredom... haha

Plans for this coming holiday (Chinese New Year). Hmm... probably watched Bloody Monday (marathon)... I just bought the other day at Jusco. Buy one free one (that's around 14USD)... the other drama can't remember what it is... so if I really need to kill time then I'm going to watch it... hahaha...

The other day I just watched 2 Days 1 Night (KBS TV) again... Really funny as hell. I'm going to be tuning in to their show every Wednesday now. This 2009 series will also include other prominent figure as guest of the show. Kim C even said that their first guest might be their final one! LOL ! Judging from what I've seen so far, that could be true ^^. 

The first guest was Chan Ho Park, an international baseball player. The 6 of them drooling over the star without shame^^. The best part is where Kang&nbsp;Ho Dong needs to flick Chan Ho's forehead after losing one of the show's games. Even so when Chan Ho tries to redeem himself, he ends up getting double flick ... LOL! The funny thing is Chan Ho's kept his grudge over Kang Ho Dong and got his revenge when he partnered with Kang Ho Dong in a race. (One needs to lift one's partner while running up the mountain). As expected from the show, Chan Ho who was leading&nbsp; with Kang Ho Dong strapped on his back, suddenly fell down and loses. Yes, he did that purposely. LOL!!! The penalty was Kang Ho Dong needs to join one of Chan Ho's annual ritual; dipping in the mountain's lake (this is during winter)!!! O_o!!! I still remember how cold they get from last week show, only this time is Kang Dong's turn. HAHAHA!!! I really can't wait what's going to happen next week."

Just finish cooking Lodeh (a traditional soup contains carrots, potatoes, long beans, tauhu, so'on, and coconut milk) best served with rice, rendang, sambal kacang... yuMMy... it's easy to cook it but not the preparation... anyway I'm done and tomorrow is makan time... hahaha

Just want to wish all muslim... Happy Aidiladha... Hopefully the journey that we'll be taking will somehow lead us back to our faith.

p/s : We only use Laksa Johor paste for this coming raya. We use spageti instead of the usual one and use ikan tenggiri instead of ikan kembung.... Fuh all this food talking really makes me hungry... Nyum nyum...."

"event","With the recent happening in eka, ppl say that I've been silent... Well, the thing is I've been away coz I was too busy with my works and couldn't really sit down and absorbed all this madness/ reality... 

First I started subbing so that I could understand and I think it would be good if others can see it too... Thus I recall from way back earlier where the internet is newly introduced and lots of things you could get from there and yes.. it's free... well as long as you pay the bill... I remember that we used to download free stuffs like mp3, movies which yes have their copyright issues thus making downloading as illegal material etc etc... Yes, who wouldn't like to have them for free? I know I do... I kind of sad when they closed down NAPSTER and all but then they introduced the word 'SHARING' ... It's&nbsp;a new way of downloading the thing&nbsp;with a host like u-torrent, limewire etc...&nbsp;&nbsp;is it still illegal?... We use the word share to avoid illegal issues... hmmm is it similar to what happened here? Or am I rambling without any direction.... 

Ppl can judge and it's quite subjective... Human's Law are breakable... why because we made them. We can bend and amend them in anyway possible... but based on what? Our feelings or logic? Yes, a bit tricky but that's&nbsp;what I'm concerned&nbsp;from this fiesca. Ppl can judge you and label you with anything but the most important thing is your intention. It's pretty simple, really... And our intention is to share... period. It's true that subbing the video is illegal, but hear me out on this,&nbsp;our intention is not. We considered it as sharing&nbsp;and not distributing or making profit out of it. That's why we fight hard for this. 

Ppl say that we're green and new to these situation and that this&nbsp;selling subbed material&nbsp;has been the same all along, and not just with us but others too. Well, it will be the same if we don't do something about it, right? At least with us doing something radical, perhaps we can learn and improve to tackle the problem much better. That's how I see it."

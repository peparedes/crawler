"event","What a bad day yesterday, So many rights have been taken away.

Let us start with the eleven states that agreed to ban gay marriages.  This is a Christian fundamentalist's law, and it goes against everything this country has come to stand for, hence all men created equal.  Fine, don't let gays marry but you have to at least give everybody the chance for something equal.  Don't call it marriage, but give them all the same rights and privileges that we take for granted in marriage.  Did you know that even if a couple has been together for over 50 years their place in the Will can be contested and is almost always taken away.  With the world of marriage being at approximately a 50% divorce rate, why are we continually trying to kill love.

Second, the smoking ban, 
A. Thank you, you may have just lost me my job, or at least make it a lot less profitable.  Just down the road from my bar smoking is still allowed. If nothing else it should be statewide, not city or county.
B.  This is another right being taken way.  The right does not belong to smokers, it belongs to a private business owner.  They have a right to run their business anyway they want, if you want a non-smoking bar....open one yourself.  I am a non-smoker, and I hate the smoke.  I have allergies and contacts, I work in a bar...trust me I feel the pain. But it is still a right being taken away.

Speaking of rights being taken away,  I refuse to completely give in at this point, but it looks like the majority of people voted for George W.....fine, you asked for it.  I'll just claim, that it's not my fault when the world continues to go to shit...not much solace, but at least it's some. 
I just hope he signs more acts that kill the environment, and take away our first Constitution right, as he covers himself in an American Flag and calls himself a Patriot."

"event","I've been thinking (Although most would call it drinking(not really, I just thought it would be a great opening line for a song)), and I realized that today was better than yesterday....and that is a good thing.  It's not that yesterday was bad, or today is that great either.  I just think that today's been better.  Why I say this is because it is the one thing in life we can hope for.  It is the perfect goal, not too lofty, nor too paltry.  It's just all we can hope for.  I'm not trying to put this in a sad, melancholy way but as something to inspire myself.  If I can accomplish this simple thing every day, I have some great days to look forward too.  Sure occasionally I may falter back, but my plan is only to let it a day or so.

Music - ""Dry Your Eyes Mate"" By The Streets(if you can find the version with Chris Martin of Coldplay singing the chorus, I strongly suggest that you get that version)  This song makes me wish my heart was currently broken.  
""Take it Away"" by The Used, accually their new Album, In Love or Death is good although it does not rock as hard as their first CD.  I would still recommend this CD.

Movies - Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - A fantastic movie which is now out on DVD, or you can just come over and we can watch it together.

Books - ""Choke"" by Chuck Palahniuk - it's kind of an anti-hero type book, he is also the auther of Fight Club.

TV - If you have never seen the live action version of ""The Tick"", I suggest that you download an episode (Sadly, it was canceled after only 9 episodes), also they have the entire series on DVD.  It could have been better but how can you resist The Tick, who fights for the great lady liberty, that we call justice.

Scrubs quote - JD just found out that as a doctor, he makes less money than the Janitor.  And he's now talking to Turk and Spence, their old college buddy whos in town for a wedding between frat buddies.
JD - ""Do you have any idea what it's like to have a janitor make more than you""
Spence - (pointing to himself) ""Johnny, investment banker, so no""
Turk - ""Hey, so I saved up like 500 bucks, where would you put that if you were me?""
Spence - ""I don't know, a wallet, a money clip....hey you could get Smitty and Dan a wedding gift, Dan wants a ferret"""

"event","I have come to realize that in the last six months, I have become a cynic.  I have spent my entire life as a hopeless romantic, as an optimist, but I no longer can.  Music has not been as good to me recently and I believe that is the reason.  Fuck love, I can no longer get my hopes up for girls who just want to knock me down.  Everytime you get your hopes up, you are bound to get knocked off your cloud, to be disappointed.  What is heartbreak, but ultimate disappointment.  The feeling of love is nothing but optimism in its purest form, and you have your expectations set so high.  All this is set up and it ends, you feel this 	indescribable pain all the way to your soul.  It's a ridiculous cycle and I realized tonight that I no longer want to play that game anymore.  I don't even know how I came to this epiphany tonight, nothing really happened to trigger it.  I can't play the relationship game.  I just don't want to do it anymore, I want a new game to play.  Maybe if it ever had a different ending or I won just once I wouldn't have lost the urge to compete.

With this  epiphany, my new job(at Murphy's), and a new quarter of school....A new Season for the TV show that is my life has begun......stay tuned for clips from our next episode......."

Scrubs quote of the week from episode 311 My Clean Break
"" Turk - So, Did you break up with her?
J.D. - I was going to last night, but then I looked into her eyes......and I realized how rare it is......to meet someone who's accually willing to have sex with me. """

"event","""So, let go
Jump in
Oh well, what you waiting for?
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So, let go
Just get in
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown""
-Frou Frou ""Let Go""

     I still am in love with this song by Frou Frou for a number of reasons, one the song is beautifully put together, great layers, great use of strings and piano(simple but wonderful)not to mention the way she uses her voice(such an elegant whisper), then there are the lyrics, they are the type of lyrics that sound like she is singing to me. Most of the time when a woman sings a song she tells a story, but everyonce in awhile she sounds like she is singing directly to the man that inspired the song in the first place.  This seems to be a lot more common in a male sung song (even more common with the ""emo"" craze).  The best example that I've found of this is Jewel's song ""Near you Always""(I know I'm a sap, but it's alright).  I listen to this song and I want to be the guy she is singing to, this rarely happens to me when I listen to music.  I think these are the determining factors to me loving this song.  Oh and I directly relate it to the greatness of Garden State.
     Ok, we'll head onto my life, which probably a lot less interesting than the music.  I'm still unenployed, which is great......sometimes.  My money is almost depleted, and I only have a little catering work comming in but I'm still getting to go out and drink(not as much, but still get to go).  And speaking of drinking, I seemed to be drunk most of the weekend.    
Starting on Friday where I started at my apartment with a buddy ,where we had a few and then went out and threw darts.  That was a pretty normal night.  Then there was Saturday, I started at a bar at 3:30PM while I was watching the game(GO BUCKS!)....took it easy cause I didn't want to spend to much money, but then I went to Sandra's going away party(She is a stunning girl from Spain and she moving back there, sadly).  The party was at a friend of her's house and they were very friendly with the beer.  And then, when that party ended a few of us went to Sandra's house to drink more....next thing I knew it was 8 in the morning. Add that up(16 and a half hours) and if you ask me, it's pretty damn impressive.  After a couple hours of sleep there, I went home and took a shower so I could walk to another bar to watch the Bengals game with my brother at 1(sadly they lost).  Needless to say I went to bed for the next day.
    I was in an article in the Other Paper, not so much me, but I was interveiwed for it as well(but I didn't speak up as much as my buddy).  It's pretty fucking funny accually especially when the guy they're talking about is one of my best friends and they're writing an article about our obssession with Karaoke.  It is true, we are that big of losers. The article even has a picture of my Karaoke Screen on page 8(Major props, if you can name the song I am singing).  Oh well at least I am cool with being a loser.  Now onto another subject, I have two interviews scheduled for tommorrow, which is cool cause I've only had one other one in the last month(and that was Thursday).  One is at a new bar opening on Polaris, that's the one I want.  And other than the drinking and the jobs(or lack of), not too much is happening in my life.  It's been another boring week and now even school is out.  But good news is I have a couple of new obsessions plus there is a new feature in my Jornal.....are you ready for it.........dadadadaaaaaaaa.......the Scrubs quote of the week.  I bet you were questioning my loserdome before I did that, but no longer are.  Ohh and I've made a new mix tape(It's my only really talent), so leave me a note if you want one.

Movie - Casablaca - possibly one of the greatest movies of all time, way ahead of it's time and it has the ""Coolest"" actors in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman....if you've never caught this one, please give it a chance(I'll even let you borrow it)

Music - DNTEL ""The Dream of Evan and Chan"", this is how Postal Service came about. Say Anything ""Alive with the Glory of Love"", Prince ""Starfish and Coffee"", Frou Frou ""Breathe In"", Koufax ""Let Us Know"", Remy Zero ""Fair"", and Ryan Adams ""Boys"".  Plus an Oldie yet goodie, ""It's Only Rock N' Rock"" by the Rolling Stones.....But I like it!

Book - ""Social Blunders"" by Tim Sadlin - kind of Fucked up story, but entertaining(I read it in one day).....Ohhhh and by the way, if anyone has The DiVinci Code and wants to let me borrow it, I'd be forever grateful.

Please send me some love(or Hate) in my comments!

"event","Hello and welcome to inside my head, turn back now, for it is a dangerous place.....I decided to start one of these stupid things, should be fun.

     My life has been fairly boring recently, it is what happens when you're unemployed, or at least what comes from being broke.  All I can say is thank goodness for $1 PBR beer at Hot Shots(I'm there every tuesday night).  Boredom should subside at least a little next weekend, now that it is football season again and it is a new era in Bengals football.....ohhh and by the way for those that remember, I was watching the preseason game on fri and I saw that stupid cheerleader I dated 2 times in the first quarter, I think God is mocking me again(we go back and forth, but I think he's winning). 
      Anyway, I've been hopeing for good things in Flordia, I already heard from my family in Miami and they're fine, but I need to call my other sister to make sure everythings alright in Boca. 
     I watched the Buckeyes game yesterday at ""Spuds"" and decided to stay at the bar afterwards, so I got a little drunk.  My Mom's Boyfriend was buying all day and and I'm not about to say ""no"".  The real problem with it was that by 7PM I was taking a nap trying to sleep off my buzz.  My body doesn't know how to get rid of it with sleeping.  It was a fun day none the less.
     I've got quite a few of my ""obsessions"" right now and I think I'm going to make a habit of putting them in this thing so here we go.

Movie - Garden State - absolutly incredible movie, Written Directed and Staring Zach Braff from Tv's ""scrubs""(which is the best show on TV) also the movie has an wonderful soundtrack and that leads us straight into

Music - Some of my favorite's from the sounds are Frou Frou's ""Let Go"", The Shins ""New Slang"", a cover by  Iron and Wine ""Such Great Heights""(The Postal Service did it orginally)....and then songs not on the soundtrack Scissor Sisters ""Take Your Mama"", Non - Prophets ""Hey Bobby""......also still obsessed with the new Say Anything album along with the Hives....

Books - Richard Russo ""Nobody's Fool"" and ""Staight Man""

yea I hope that everybody has a great week and if you're bored come to Hot Shitz on Tues night!

Ohh and one last thing, Vote, get educated and register, we must be heard"

"event","so when ppl start off writing in this shit they wanna make up some lame excuse to be like everyone else with their cool journals so they go ""im really bored so i decided to make one of these""....but i actually am really bored. its like 10:30 and yaaaa i dno. today was a snow day. it was pretty cool my mom came in my room and left me a buncha $$ and didnt even say anything to me so i just figured there was no school. i got up around 11 and called ash she had to go too phys. therapy so it was a bummer. i called sam and she was still sleepin but ended up callin me back 15 min later. around 2ish she picked me up and we went to jess's house to go ""ghetto sledding"". when i got there not even 5 min later jon and bri showed up. it was sucha good surprise =). we ate at maria's and it was just the cool thing to make fun of my forhead i guess. bc when i laugh apparently a vein sticks out and then jess had to add in that my lip twitches when i try too hard not to laugh so i just left haha.when we all got together again we just chilled at jess's and never even ended up going sledding.sam left around 5( =( ) with jerry and me n jon jess n bri went to stu's just to sit and have a few good laughs. then we dropped jess off at cheering just in time for it to be over.lol but thats jess for ya gotta love it ;)bri dropped me off n i sed byebyes to jon bc i wont be seein him til sometime next week(*tear* ill miss u dude ha) ,cuz im goin away this weekend FUCK YES =Dhehe im so excited sammay!!

"event","my face lays firmly pressed against the window of some strangers house hoping to feel the love that occurs between two spouse.
the violent screaming and fighting, the children crying as the light from the television flickers, keeping them warm and inviting.
my hand holds a cold, cold stone found hidden beneath the grass.
now i'm pressed against my window watching as they cut themselves clean of the glass.
24 years old and i live all alone, knowing full well i'll never marry or have children of my own.
and i keep the world at bay with all the stones i throw.
what else can you do when what you know of love stops loving you?
what else can you do when what you know of life falls and dies on you?
what else can you do when you cant face you?"

"event","its pretty pathetic how the majority of kids these days cannot spell. and cant begin to notice proper grammar, let alone type it.
this world has been dumbed down immensley by the internet, television, media, everything. 
everything is abbreviated. everything is an accronym. yet somehow these kids think they know everything.
but i bet once you point out how much of a lack of common sense, or grammar skills, or respect they have and begin to personally attack their stupidity they'll realize how much they've been screwed over. of course, they don't think they're getting screwed over, because they choose not to pay attention in school, they dont realize what actually matters in life and what in the world is an actual issue, besides their own. 

i'm not saying i know everything. i just know what's important.
my grandfather always said you can judge a person by two things: their shoes and how they spell.

what do you have to say for yourselves public school systems and corporate america??
don't say what you can't spell. it'll hold no water."

Hands in the air. Eyes on the floor. 
Just give me fall. Just give me my grey skies and my trees on fire.

Let me die with my dignity and my spirit well intact.

I never said I was proud. 
It's almost time. I'll be just fine.
Don't tell me I'll be alright.
It's seven months until it will be alright.
Two hundred fifteen days until my autumn nights and then I'm fucking done.
Same old story.
I don't want your fucking jokes.
I don't want your summertime smiles."

This cigar burned beautifully as it usually does and had a nice deep earthy flavor throughout the length of the cigar.  There is a hint of sharp spice in the background that is mostly prevalent in the first inch or so, but still maintains its presence through the length, up until about the last inch or so.  The one cool thing about this cigar is that it maintains the same flavor through the length; it doesn't bitter or mellow out at the end like most cigars tend to do.  This is definitely one I enjoy!"

This cigar started out great.  There was some wonderful robustness and earthiness to the smoke.  A hint of spice in the background really rounded out the taste nicely.  I had a nice white ash as it burned down, but after about an inch it started to burn unevenly.  It wasnt one of those tragic uneven burns, but annoying enough that you had to keep evening it out.  Toward the last two inches it started to draw hard and that as well made it an annoying smoke.  But the flavor was good through the cigar.  As the cigar burned down, though, the spiciness drifted and the earthy and woody flavors overpowered.  Not a bad cigar at all, and I'm sure with a second try, I'll get a better burn on it."

I tried this cigar, having tried the maduro.  I was in Annapolis and all they had was the natural wrapper...so I decided to give it a shot.  I must say I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the maduro wrap.  The natural had a far woodier flavor, and less the spicy flavor.  The length of the cigar was pretty consistent...an overpowering cedary flavor.  You could taste the pepperiness of the maduro a lil bit in the background, but it was  mostly the cedariness that stood out.  Also it had a very tight draw that made it a lil difficult to fully enjoy."

This was a decent cigar.  The thing that struck me most was the aroma of the tobacco..before and after being lit.  Just had a very nice smell to it.  The cigar itself was nothing super impressive.  It had a nice typical woody/tobacco taste through the length of the cigar.  The last inch or so got a little bittle, as typical of these mild to medium woody cigars."

This was a very good cigar.  You could smell the spice and pepperiness on the cigar before even lit.  Once lit the spice was evident and definitely tingled the tongue.  A very nice pleasant spicy and peppery taste lasted for most of the length of the cigar.  There was a deep earthly flavor intertwined with it, that made it a very nice smoke. It didn't get real bitter towards the end, so I was able to smoke it down pretty far.  The construction was great...overall...terrific cigar!"

I had some reservations about trying a 5 Vegas at first.  They are a cheaply priced cigar, and having had some experience with some cheaper cigars when I first started getting into cigars, I was a little wary.  I was hoping this wouldn't get me sick, but at the same time, I had heard alot of good things about 5 Vegas.

So, I sparked it up and I must say...I was quite impressed.  The Serie A has a nice peppery flavor that lasts through a good length of the cigar.  Towards the end of the stick, it mellows out and gets a lil creamy, but still maintains the boldness that you would expect from a more fuller bodied cigar.

The burn was good the entire length of the cigar...no construction problems at all.  Overall, I was very happy with it!"

This was an amazing cigar.  The burn was incredible and it had a great flavor.  There was a bold pepperiness and spiciness that lasted the length of the cigar.  It was very similar to a Fuente Canones, but the spice was more prominent.  There was a nice deep woody flavor (like a deep cedary taste) through the cigar too.  The last inch was mostly woody, as the spice drifted to the background.  This was one of those cigars you don't mind nubbing.  Very good!"

This was a cigar Christi brought back for us to try from San Francisco for us to try out.  The shop fresh rolled the cigars on the spot.  I was excited to try.

This cigar had a mild woody taste outside of the mild spice that was evident for a good portion of the cigar.  It was a very subdued spice that didnt make the cigar too strong. It was just kind of a mild punctuation on top of a already mild flavored woody cigar. It was very good for a cigar rolled at a small shop.  I definitely would not mind smoking one again.  Wanna take another San Fran trip Christi?  :)"

This was definitely a good quality cigar.  From the first light, there was quite a hint of spice in the tobacco.  After the first few puffs of medium spice, a mild cedary taste appeared in the background.  As the cigar burned down, the tastes flipped...the spiciness fell to the background and the cedary flavor became more prominent.  I wish the spices lasted longer and stronger through the length of the cigar, but otherwise, definitely a smoke I would recommend to anyone!!"

From the first puff, I could taste a wonderful spiciness to it, especially in the wrapper.  It had a very solid robust flavor through most of the stick.  The last inch or so got kind of bitter and that was disappointing.  Overall, a good stick though."

This is a very very good smoke.  It's a time committment, but well worth the experience if you have the time to enjoy.  The classic Fuente cigar flavor is present throughout the length of it.  It has some nice earthy tones along with the spicy taste, similar to the Canones.  Although the Canones definitely has more spice than the Hemmingway.  The cigar had a great burn straight through.  I definitely recommend this one to anyone."

This cigar was not a bad cigar.  It didn't have the typical kick of most cigars that I like, but the flavor was not awful.  It had a fairly even cedary flavor throughout the length of the stick.  A bit of bitterness towards the last inch and a half.  It burned even and well throughout the length.  A good cigar for after a light meal."

This was a very good cigar.  Very earthy, woody flavor straight through the cigar.  Didn't get real bitter at the end like many cigars do.  There was a nice spiciness to it too at the start of the cigar.  It mellowed out towards the middle, and the woodiness became more prevalent than the spiciness.  Good even burn straight through.  Definitely a winner in my book!"

Like the DL-700 I reviewed earlier, an awesome cigar.  The spice was definitely evident on the wrapper.  The draw was very smooth and gave a good amount of smoke...gotta love that chisel shape.  It wasn't as overall spicy as the DL-700, but it had a very nice amount of spice to the flavor.  It was a good cigar."

This cigar was a wee bit disappointing.  The wrapper construction was awful and it kept unravelling.  That made it hard to smoke.  The flavor, on the other hand, was not bad, but it was just a fairly typical woody flavored cigar.  It lacked the spice I was expecting from a cameroon cigar of this nature."

As far as woody cigars go, this one was one of the best I have smoked.  It had a nice creaminess to it that lasted the length of the cigar unil the last inch, when it got a lil bitter.  The creamy cedary flavor was a very nice flavor.  I'm not super huge on alot of woody cigars, but this one was very very good."

This is one amazing smoke, that's all I have to say.  It sometimes tends to burn a little uneven, but that is the only ""bad"" quality to it I can find.  It has these wonderful earthy/woody flavors throughout the length of it, mixed with a nice coffee like hint.  The first inch or two tend to have a little spice to them, but the spice mellows out to the earthy/coffee flavor by the time you hit the end of the stick.  All in all, a great smoke."

This was an interesting cigar.  The wrapper had a strong chocolatey flavor.  The cigar itself had a cedary kind of flavor.  So as you puffed...the chocolate and cedar flavors mixed together.  The first inch or so had a nice spice to it too...but that faded after that inch.  The cigar burned evenly and drew well.  Overall, a great cigar...just quite an interesting flavor."

This was a surprisingly good cigar.  I didn't think I was going to like it at first, as I tend not to be a fan of most Ashton cigars, outside of the VSGs.  Even though it was a more milder cigar, by my palate, it had a wonderful sugary flavor.  It was a very sweet cigar, some sugary tones, and a nice nutty background taste.  I was surprised!  A tasty lil treat it was."

This was a very very good cigar.  Burned great...nice and slow.  Had a very consistent flavor through the cigar.  There were definite hints of coffee and nut that produced a wonderful flavor.  I was able to smoke this one down pretty far without any bitterness.  Overall, a wonderful smoke."

This was a good cigar...even though it gave me a damn headache!! lol  It burned nicely through most of the cigar... got a lil tight towards the middle though, but wasn't a major problem.  It had a nice spicy flavor that wasn't overpowering.  There was a nice cedary flavor through the cigar with a pepperiness that brought out the spice.  Overall, definitely a good cigar."

I have had this cigar before, and I again enjoyed it this time.  The cigar is just full raw strength from beginning to end.  The cigar has a nice chocolately underlying flavor.  The forefront of the cigar, though, is all spice.  Nice, deep, rich spiciness.  The smoke tingles your tongue, lips and throat.  It's a strong cigar, but I love this one and always enjoy kicking back and puffing on it!!"

This cigar has been talked about alot, and I was very excited to try it, due to all the hype.  I must say, though, I was a little let down.  First thing I noticed about this stick was that it burned a little uneven through the first two inches or so.  It evened out after that point.  Overall, it had a fairly woody/cedary taste typical to your average medium body cigar.  But, the high point was that it didn't have the bitterness that many medium bodies seem to carry.  There was also a pleasant spice that tingled the back of your throat.  It wasn't a highly noticeable spice...very faint.  But that made the smoke a little more enjoyable.

All in all, I'd say the cigar didn't live up to the hype that I have heard over it...but not a bad smoke."

This cigar is amazing.  It's a full body cigar with a dark maduro wrapper but it is a great one!  It's a little different from other Brazilias in that I taste the woodiness of this one more than on an Amazon or Gol.  The woody flavor hits you first until you burn past the producto end of it.  Then the spice kicks in and you get this wonderful blend of woodiness with an edge of spice to it.  It's a great flavor.  The cigar burned evenly from beginning to end.  It started burning out a bit towards the last inch and a half, and I had to relight it twice.  Other that that...a very awesome smoke!!"

Now, I have had the shorter robusto size before, and that had a similar bland Ashton taste in my opinion.  Having smoked the churchill size...WOW.  It has a nice dark maduro wrapper that had a nice spicy taste on the lips.  Once lit, it burned nicely through the cigar.  The one I smoked was starting to get dry, and even though it had a little peeling, it was still an AWESOME smoke.

The flavor was a consistent spicy mix throughout the whole cigar.  It was on the stronger side and packed a nice buzz.  Went very well with the rum and cokes I was drinking.  I cannot pick out any particular spices that jumped out at my tongue, but overall it was just one kick of spice and I loved it.  Highly recommend the Sorcerer size to anyone that loves a strong spicy smoke!"

A fellow cigar lover by the name of Aimee suggested I try a Rocky Patel Vintage.  It was an OK stick.  Didn't really notice the flavor until a few puffs in, but it had a nice woody/cedary flavor.  Almost licorice like as the cigar progressed.  It was a nice even flavored smoke straight through.  It didn't get bitter towards the end like some cigars do, so it was a cigar that could easily be nubbed.

The cigar burned a little uneven at times, but the wrapper fixed perfectly when retorched to even it out.  It had a slightly tight draw, but nothing that would come close to making it a bad smoke at all.  Overall...a fair smoke."

This cigar had a nice oily wrapper, and had a perfect draw.  It burned evenly for the most part, and I only had to even it out a few times.  The draw is what impressed me the most.  It burned quickly and had great air flow.  I love when a cigar doesn't draw real tight.  Flavor wise, there was a consistent woody flavor through the whole stick.  As it burned down, a nice chocolately flavor appeared.  It got a little bitter in the last inch or so, which I didn't like too much, but overall, it was a pleasant smoke otherwise... I'd recommend."

"event","Well, I'm quite excited today.  I will finally be in the Synod Yearbook as a staff minister.  I still don't have a call because the moola is so tight in the Synod, but I'm still very excited.  Pastor Schroeder called the District President and talked him into it saying that my job was so much more than just a volunteer ESL teacher.  

I'm really hoping that this is a foot in the door for keeping my job for next year.  After Sunday, I just didn't even want to think of leaving here.  There's so much good that I can do and to share the gospel with so many people.  I know I could do that anywhere, but this place fits me like a glove.

So, dear void, rejoice with me!"

"event","Well, Peeps, namely Matt,

I'm back!  I'm sitting in my nearly newly refurbished office at church.  I'm so excited!  I start teaching on June 26.  Although I have alot of work to do until then, not to mention the fact that my parents are coming, I am so happy to finally get it done!!!

I bought all new posters and stuff, since mine were ruined by the roof leakage (hee hee).  I even put up the alphabet and a little kids' calendar.  Everyone says my classroom looks like a preschool room, but that's pretty much how I have to teach the adults.  We just have lots of fun!

Sorry I don't have anything more interesting to report like having a baby, getting a call, or traveling around foreign lands.  I'm just happy my life is getting back to the dysfunctional normalcy it once was."

"event","Thanks Matthew for your faithfulness.  I love the journal.  

Is it unhealthy to be obsessed with serial killers?  I just can't stop reading all these nonfiction books about the BTK killers, the Zodiac killer, Ted Bundy, Scott Peterson...I think there might be something wrong with my brain.  I get such a thrill out of it and yet freak myself out every couple of hours, thinking someone is going to jump out from behind the shower curtain or climbing over my roof to break open my sliding door in my bedroom.

To make matters worse, I'm also completely obsessed with LOST, which has alot of serial-killer elements to it.  Not as many killings, but suspense and always being on guard.  I feel like those young teenage boys who start believing that Dungeons and Dragons is real (Sorry Peeps).  My apartment looks alot like the set from LOST and I'm always expecting John Locke or Dr. Jack (ooh, baby) to come out of the vegetation.

And then there's still Zach Braff and the soundtrack guy from Barnes and Noble....Ay yi yi.

I think because of all these cancer treatments etc.  I have to give up all my addictions, smoking, eating, alcohol, only to fill it with some other forms of addiction...imagination.  It's a fun addiction.  You totally get a high, but when you start calling your Pastor, Mr. Echo, or Turk, you know you've gone too far."

"event","Zup?  So, I went to my quinceanera on Saturday.  It was really fun.  The girl was dressed up really fancy and everything turned out well...except for the seating arrangements.  I was seated next to the pastors and their families, particularly to my immediate left, Ubayde Medina, the Mexican pastor's wife.  She's notorious for being outspoken and headstrong, but I was the brunt of her comments on this day.  She started talking to me about my health...a favorite topic of mine (oh, so not) when she leaned over and said in a loud, spanglish-drenched voice, ""I'm not going to talk about this here, but I'm going to give you some diet pills.  I've seen people take them before and they always look so much better!  Me, I've taken them and they really work, you know.  But me, I'm just too lazy, so I give them to you.  You get lots of boys then, you know.  Hahahaha...No, mi hija?""

How should I respond?  
A:  Thank you for pointing out my biggest (no pun intended) point of self-consciousness that has plagued me my whole life and sharing it with the entire table, ballroom, city, state, country, and planet. 

B:  How gracious of you to push illegal Mexican drugs at me.  I'll be sure to alert the authorities.

C:  That's funny, they must not work on big fat mouths like yours.

D:  So funny that you mentioned my lack of a boyfriend.  I had almost forgotten that my 26th birthday is upon me, and I have yet to meet anyone even remotely worthy of this fat heinie.

E:  all of the above.

What did I say?
Smile, nod, and say nothing.  Now, that takes grace even from a fattie.

I mean, why announce that you're not going to talk about something when the paragraph that immediately rambles off your lips is the very topic you weren't going to talk about and then follow it up with a loving pet name as though I meant something to you?  Why not stand up on the table and scream, ""You're FAT!""

""But defend them speak well of them and take their words and actions in the kindest possible way.""  Jeez, Luther (Martin), I take it no one ever called you fat.

OK, I know she was doing it with the best of intentions.  I just had to vent."

I just bought the soundtracks to Grey's Anatomy and the Last Kiss.  I love them...especially the Last Kiss soundtrack.  Rufus Wainwright sings Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk if that gives you any indication of the kind of stuff it is.

I've also been commissioned to write a song for our church's dedication.  I don't know about this whole music composition thing folks.  I've never felt like I was much the music writing kind, more just the expressionist of an already written piece.  It makes me really nervous to have lots of people from around the WELS be there to listen to it and probably criticize it.  

I feel like I don't know what I'm doing, but hopefully the Spirit will move me soon.  I feel like a completely fake composer.  I don't know anything about chording or proper music notation or any of that crap.  I just hope that people don't see through my facade anytime soon.  I need a paycheck.  

I wonder if any of the late greats ever felt that way.  Did they really know what they were doing or were they just faking it?"

To make matters worse, we're FINALLY starting construction after 9 months of pleading and fighting with the architect, builders, and city.  Therefore we have to move all of our furniture out of the church into a little storage bin or upstairs in the sweltering office.

I had a GREAT day yesterday.  I continually worry even though I know you shouldn't and have suffered through so many things with God turning everything for the better anyway.  You'd think after all these things, I would have learned, but I haven't.  I kept reading Luke 20 to help me not worry and it started to, but I still wasn't sleeping well.

I've been freaking out about my living situation.  Even though the pastor reassured me that everything would be fine with the apartment of my choice, it was not.  No matter how much bloody math I did, my income wasn't working out in my favor.  So, I had to give up the dream of the beautiful loft.  I searched all around the area for apts., but nothing was comparable to where I live now and some of them were just scary.  

I didn't know what to do, so I called my landlady to see if I could just stay in the Islander apts.  She wasn't there, so I left a note.  I was in turmoil all weekend.  I couldn't sleep, I was depressed and nervous.  Then I got the call at 10 AM yesterday.  ""No, we don't have apts. available.""  (heart dropping to feet) ""but, I have a friend who owns apts. 2 blocks away called the Hanakiki apts.  They're almost the same as ours but more excluded.  They have a tropical atmosphere, there's lots of single people, I have a 1 bedroom available, and the rent is $975 a month.""  (Angels busting out in the Hallelujah Chorus)

So, the rent is even cheaper than I was willing to pay, the apts. are beautiful and even better than where I live.  It's not any closer or further away from the church, and I will be living near single people!  God is amazing!

I also taught my first day of classes last night.  I was so nervous that there wouldn't be enough people or that it wouldn't go well, but it did.  The Intermediates were excited, and it was refreshing to be able to teach all in English and have them understand me.  Then for the Beginner class, lots of Intermediates stayed, and I was concerned they would be bored, but it ended up great.  Having them help the Beginners was such a blessing because I didn't have to do as much work.  They were the teachers.  They felt proud for what they knew and they got extra practice.  It was really hot and humid in the room and a little crowded, but they were learning, and I was relieved."

He stepped past the man and noticed a little pink poodle curled up under the table.  ""Strange,"" he thought.  He looked over the pink table with a pink tablecloth.  He saw pink bowls, pink spoons, pink glasses, and pink orange juice.  He took a seat on a pink chair next to a little girl dressed all in pink and a lady dressed in pink as well.  There were two other men sitting at the table happily munching on Cornflakes and admiring the pink decor around them.  The lady poured the man his pink bowl of Wheaties and passing him the pink phone said, ""Feel free to call long distance. Would you like some milk?""  And she proceeded to pour pink milk out of an equally pink pitcher.  And here the story ends.

Now, what is the moral of the story?

2 out of 3 people prefer Cornflakes over Wheaties."

I'm really excited because I've finally resolved the issue of how to get my things to Cali.  Instead of getting a U-Haul, my uncle who owns a Church Supply store, is going to take my boxes and UPS them to me.  He gets a discount and another one if he sends it to a church.  My only problem is how to get some of my furniture out here like bookshelves, an antique desk, and an antique rocking chair.  Hmmm...

I'm still trying to decide WHEN to move. I don't want to tell my apt. managers too soon cuz I don't want to get kicked out, but I don't want to wait too long cuz I don't want to have to pay so much money for so many months.  I am SO excited about the loft, though.  I'm just not sure all my childhood stuff will fit with the color scheme, but I'll make it work somehow.  I'm trying to avoid the flower-throw-up look, since I know how unpopular it has been.  I want a more world-traveled feel, but want it to look classy and not cheap."

I had some funky dreams last night.  I dreamt that we are all back in the Apartment except it looked like Gillian and Luther's backyard.  I had my pink and green quilt wrapped around my neck and Daisy kept trying to curl up in it.  Everyone was talking about Yucky Chucky and throwing marshmallows in a fire pit.  Then someone came up the stairs and we all freaked out.  We heard them open the door to the attic and crawl up there.  The boys went up and got shot and killed and G and I were crying.  Then I woke up.

Sorry it was a morbid dream, but at least it was fun chucking marshmallows in the fire!"

Although Match Point was not the most intriguing movie, I was very surprised by the twist at the end.  It's worth a rent, but cannot be counted among my favorite movies.

Shopgirl on the other hand was quite intriguing to me.  The first 17 minutes or so fit my life to a tee. (How do you spell tee there...and what does that actually mean or where did it come from?)  After that, the movie takes a weird twist.  The relationship between Claire Danes and Steve Martin is just disgusting.  It seems almost incestuous even though they're not related, I couldn't help but think of a father and daughter...ew!  The end is wonderful.  My favorite line is, ""I'll protect you."" (big hug, smell the hair) ""I will."" Still doesn't rate among my favorites, but it was quite interesting."

"event","Wow, I haven't really written much for awhile, so I thought I'd catch you up.  In light of Nate's grandma, these things may sound trivial, but perhaps can put a smile on someone's face.

Good Friday church sucked.  Our Mexican pastor was supposed to be in charge of it (he usually just does the prayer of the church because he's so old, he can't take much more).  He, however, got totally lost and confused.  We were supposed to read the 7 words of Christ.  Phrase 1, song, phrase 2, song etc.  Well, he completely skipped over the songs and read then straight through and had a 10 minute commentary after each one.  He also randomly selected peeps from the congregation to read.  You really should warn people about that, since many of our members are illiterate.  Pastor Schroeder was sitting there with the most irate look on his face.  After about 20 + minutes, he came back by me to decide what we should do.  Should we just skip to the end or what?  Suddenly, Pastor Medina announced a song and I scrambled to find it.  Then we continued with the nailing of black ribbons on the cross, which took forever.  Finally, I played the last song and a small interlude, when the lights went out.  Our usher turned the lights off as I was playing, and there was absolutely no way for me to see.  I finished with a strange chord and high-tailed it out of there fuming.  To make matters worse, this was the first experience our new pastor and his family had in our church. 

On Saturday, I also damaged my left arm while playing piano, because I had spent  3 hours the previous day practicing piano with our guitarist for the installation and then proceeded to play a very difficult rendition of ""When I Survey the Wondrous Cross"" for preservice on Good Friday followed by another 3 hour practice session with the inept guitarist on Sat.  I felt my hand snap, and a pain shot through me up to my elbow.  Tiny blood vessels must have broken because very large bruises began appearing, and a tingling sensation went up my pinkie and ring finger making it difficult to move my fingers.  So I went home and iced my hand, had a restless night, and woke up with a crick in my neck and an immobile left arm.  I kept ice on it all through Easter service and managed to get through it, but the ""Triumphant Entry"" wasn't quite up to par.  Oh well.

Luckily I was able to get away and spent 2 days at the Days Inn in San Clemente.  I walked into the lobby,which smelled strongly of incense and Ramen noodles and was greeted by a very old and flamy hotel manager.  He asked what I was doing at the hotel, and then asked if I had a boyfriend.  I of course said no, and he proceeded to tell me the best place to pick up surfers.  ""I go there when I'm sick of my partner and need a little different twist."" Great, thanks.  I did go to the beach and did meet some surfers, but spent most of the time soaking up sun, walking the pier and finishing the 5th Harry Potter.   I'm now officially a Potter-head.  (finally)

The next day I went to San Juan Capistrano and toured the Mission there.  It was built in the 1700s and in the big earthquake of 1812, it was destroyed except for the back wall where the altar was and the base of the bell tower.  It was a beautiful piece of history, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I just wish I could have shared it with someone.  Anyways, I went next to Dana Point and toured the harbor.  I also got a refreshing smoothie at the ""Scoop Deck"" and read some more Harry Potter.  After a few more run-ins with the hotel manager, and surfer gazing I headed home, but took detour to Newport Beach to go to my ThyCa meeting.  It's great to get support from other people who've experience what I have.  It feels like a little family.

Sunday was spent at church, of course, and then a 9 hour birthday party at a members house.  Then onto another birthday party, then the pastors' house for a post party.  

Yesterday, I went to court all day with a member to try and help her get her daughter back.  I did lots of interpreting and arguing.  I learned so much new vocab the last couple of days, my head is swimming.  I think I need another vaction.

Hope you're all doing well.  Don't forget:  ANNOUNCING PEEP_FEST 2006 TO BE HELD AT REEDE'S HOUSE IN ORANGE COUNTY, CA.  JUNE 26-LIFE.  ALL ARE WELCOME!  BYOTP (Bring your own toilet paper)."

In a few moments, I will be going on VACATION!!!  OK, just a two day excursion to nearby San Clemente, but I'm so excited.  I haven't had a break in a long time and I'm looking forward to relaxing on the beach and soaking up some sun.  

I think I might be coming home from June 12-24 more or less.  I'm hoping ya'll can still come out and visit around then.  I'll work my schedule around YOU!  I'm flexible...not in a ""Stick It"" kind of way.

I've also just been asked to help put together a Spanish hymnal for the Synod.  Sounds interesting.  I just hope they like my ideas for Latinizing music instead of hymn-na-nizing it.  

I just bought conga drums for church.  They're a beautiful blue and from Toca manufacturers, which apparently are what all the great latin bands have.  Our drummer is a high school student, but he's amazing and believe it or not, I'm actually kind of learning to play!  I don't think I would ever subject anyone to sitting and watching me, however.  It is a really nice way to get out aggression.

Have a great day!"

I've forgotten how uncomfortable wet jeans are.  It reminded me of falling in the river in Colorado with A and Erin L.  Tee hee!

"event","Can I just say without sounding too sinful that sometimes I hate working for the church?  It comes and goes, but lately I've been feeling really frustrated with the attitudes of people and lack of appreciation.

Since we've gotten our new building, people have been acting more and more like a regular church and with that comes the pettiness of Lutheran people.  It seems to have crossed cultural borders suddenly, and none of us were ready for it.

Our church president has a big something up his something and it's pissing us off.  Today (after almost 7 semanas of Lent) he said he thinks we should practice the Lent songs cuz they're too hard.  I've arranged a few of them:  Go to Dark Gethsemane, Stricken Smitten and Afflicted, and O Sacred Head Now Wounded.  We've sung these songs since Ash Wednesday and everyone seemed to be singing them well, but he's a major something and to appease him, we'll do it.  So, tomorrow at church we'll be practicing our songs for a half hour before the actual service.

Then he said that for the installation service, which is at 4 PM on Sunday, April 30, that maybe we shouldn't have church that morning cuz he doesn't want to come to church twice and doesn't think many members will want to.  OK, buddy, nice way to welcome your new pastor.  

Then he had a cow about hiring a taco guy to come and make tacos.  He thinks the women should prepare everything for 100+ people.  And you know who has to be in charge of that, Carrie and I.  (If my grammar isn't perfect while writing this, nut up and shut up!...a line from my pastor:-)  Like we don't have enough crap to do for this thing without having to stand over 7 grills and grilling 50 lbs of carne asada and pollo.  

Another lady in our church keeps complaining about the way the pastor's wife plays piano.  She isn't the greatest, but she does it out of her heart and if anyone can do it better, they can step up and do it.  

Yet another woman asked me if I could help her daughter get ready for her quinceanera in May.  I've driven up to LA for 14 hours looking for material, tiaras, invitations, party gifts.  I've spent hours looking through dress books and cutting out material, picking the girl up for her fittings etc. All this just to find out that her mom is a big fat liar and never intended on throwing a quinceanera for her!!!!  Now, the church is going to have to fund this big fiesta and I have to tell the daughter that it's not happening.  Yet, I just got an invitation from the same woman to go to a huge baby shower she's throwing for her son's whore and bastard baby.  You can do that, but you can't do something nice for your youngest daughter after you dumped her off in Aruba for 4 years and is now encouraging to get pregnant?!?!?!  How is it that you're so fortunate to have the title of ""mother""?  That word should be follwed by another if you ask me.

Our building project isn't building.  Our pastor is getting so mad at the architect because he hasn't made any of the necessary changes yet and our contractor is threatening to quit.  

I spent 14 hours on Wednesday picking out music for the installation service, recording music, making music packets etc. for the other instrumentalists only to find out that our guitarist probably isn't going to do it and our drummer can't get ahold of any drums.  

I cannot rely on anyone here.  It seems everyone is just full of ungratefulness and anger.  What ever happened to being thankful that you made it over here safely, you have a roof over your head, your pastors and teachers left their cultures and homes to work for you, not to mention the fact that Jesus died to save your sorry butt?  It's times like these when I wonder, why should I even stay here?  But then I realize that any job you have comes with it's own frustrations and when you're working for the church no matter where you are, there's freaks and idiots who need to hear about God's Word and you've been blessed to be the stability in their lives.  So with that, I will shut up."

"event","I don't know if any of you have heard what's been going on with Sensenbrenner's new bill passing the House of Representatives having to do with immigration crack down, but it's not pretty.  Although I understand that illegal immigration is wrong and wholeheartedly believe that something needs to be done about border control, etc.  I cannot support different aspects of this new law.  Something that should have been nipped in the bud years ago wasn't and now everyone who has come over illegaly because of the irresponsiblity of our government will be forced back across the border if they're caught.  What's the big deal?  Families will be split up, churches are going to be fined and churchworkers thrown in jail if they're caught helping illegal immigrants, jobs will go out of business, Santa Ana will basically become a ghost town, people that have already lived here 30 years with no problems will suddenly have to go back after they've been trying to gain citizenship but denied because it's a corrupt process.  I know that something needs to be done, of course, but I don't think that this is the right course.  300,000 people protested in LA, 35,000 protested in Milwaukee and thousands of others protested in Chicago and other large cities.  I can understand why some people may feel like this is the right thing to do, but unless you have lived both sides of it, I don't think you're entitled to an opinion.  I don't see this as just a political question, but I see this as affecting people:  the people in my church, the people I live with, the people I work with, my friends, my extended familia.  Church attendance was so low yesterday because many people were scared to leave their homes, scared that they'd be caught.  I can't tell you how many countless times I have heard stories of mother's needing to escape abusive husbands, daughters escaping abusive fathers, fathers trying to provide for their families by coming to the US, families trying to get a better life for their children.  Yes, there are some people here with wrongdoing in mind, but the majority of the people I have encountered are hard-working, loving people like you and me.  I have been to the poorest pueblos in Mexico and Ecuador.  I have seen the lack of opportunity or growth there.  If you don't own the small gas station, the mercado, or work for the church, there's nothing for you.  I've seen the schools and the lack of proper books.  I've taught people to read after having only had a 2nd grade education.  I am TRYING to teach people English.  I have helped many people study for their citizenship tests.  I have fought for the children in their schools and helped mothers become more aware of the blessings of education.  I have shared God's word with men and women, elderly and children.  We are helping them as children of God not legal or illegal people.   Should these PEOPLE be forced to leave after sacrificing so much to get here?  NO!!!!  Does something need to be done to improve the situation?  YES!!!  Do I have the answer?  NO!!!!  But do I care and want to make a difference?  YES!!!  I wish that people would stop seeing each other as a color, race, or ethnicity.  I wish they'd see them as PEOPLE just like you and me."

1. I played for a funeral yesterday.  Our pastor and I didn't even know the people.  They're relatives of someone from church and just asked us to do it, since they don't have a church.  The out-of-tune-piano was located 3 feet from the head of the corpse.  Eesh!

2. Immediately following the service, a priest came and Our Fathered and Hail Maryed the woman out of purgatory.  HAHA!

3. I got hit on by a black man at 7/11 the other day.  He liked my ""box,"" my purse in the shape of a box...I assume that's the box he was talking about.

4. I haven't seen ANTM yet.  I tape all my other shows, since I work all night.

5. My students are driving me nuts.  I had them practice a conversation yesterday, and had them practice reading and looking up and speaking with emotion.  One student complained that I was pressuring them too much.  Suck it up, @*)%_)(!

6. I've tried to teach There is/ There are this entire week, and my students still don't get it.  They're always saying, ""They is one book in the table.""

7. I've started hanging out more with Johnny (a Mexican-American from English bible study).  He's really funny and nice.  He's my only friend here.  And he has connections to James.  :-)

8. I'm getting a small ensemble together for the installation of our new pastor in April.  I also spent 9+ hours yesterday looking for music to rock the house.  I'm excited, but it's been difficult to find good stuff.  Any suggestions?

9. Should I get a really super awesome loft apartment or get a dog?  

10. I have to go to our Mission board chairman's house tomorrow on my day off.  I'm not looking too forward."

We were supposed to go out with our friend Johnny for St. Patrick's Day on Fri, but he ended up drinking early in the morning and was trashed by the time we were supposed to go out with him.  We got a drunk phone call at 7 PM, with someone pissing on his car and him screaming into the phone.  Needless to say, we decided not to go out.  Instead, Carrie's aunt came over and we ate corned beef and cabbage and drank Killian's Irish Red beer.  Then I went to the pastor's house, since he was on vacation and pulled an all-night laundry escapade.  I got another phone call from Johnny at 2 AM, and was all crying and asking for my help on how to clean up his life.  I just said, ""Get it together and be who you say you want to be.""  Then I told him to go to bed.

On Sat, after getting no sleep the night before, I left bright and early to drive 2 church members up to LA to the fashion district, so we could look for material for a quinceanera dress and church altar paraments.  We saw a variety of people from all over the world, speaking different languages, and drag queens of all ethnicities.  It was fun and interesting, but I was so tired, I couldn't really enjoy it.

Then on Sun, I had church, met with a student who balled her eyes out about her past drinking problems (snooze!),  and then attended my only piano students' piano recital.  It was a joint recital with other teachers.  30 kids in all, singing, and playing instruments poorly. It was a hoot.

Next weekend doesn't seem to be shaping up much better as I have to go to dinner at our Mission board chairman's house and present my job outline for next year.  

I'm just glad I'm going on vacation in a couple of weeks!"

Abel (Carrie's boyfriend) found out that he will not be graduating this year as planned.  He ended up failing Practicum.  Prof. Graf said he wasn't ""stepping up his game.""  Hello!  It's PRACTICUM!  Who the h*** cares?  Carrie and Abel are both really upset, but they aren't sure what to do.  She was planning on going to the reservation to live near him, but now she's not sure.  

So, after this drama occurred, we decided to head to Original Mike's for a couple of brewskis and to see JAMES!  We sat in his section, which was awesome.  He sat and talked to us for a bit and brought us a shot of (I'm blushing) ""white pussy.""  (Tee hee!  *blush* *blush*)  It was pretty good actually.  After he was done working, he came over and talked to us for awhile.  He habla un poquito espanol (very big plus) and drives a totally hot red '69 Nova, which he's looking to sell.  I have hook ups with a mechanic from church, so I'm going to see if he knows someone who can buy the car.  He's just so easy to talk to.  I love it!

Then Carrie and I went to see our friend Johnny and the three of us drove up to LA to pick up my sister from the airport.  So, the day ended well.

Is anyone else excited about Roadtrip '06?!?!"

Anyways, I like to watch this program about stuff to do in California on a local cable channel.  This old guy has a HUGE microphone on a long cord and goes to all these little touristy sites.  Yesterday, he went down old Rt. 66 near San Bernadino to the Wigwam hotel.  It's a group of little teepees made into rooms with covered wagon beds and all kinds of stuff.  This guy has a SEVERE southern accent and with much surprise in his voice and stated the following:  (tee hee haha HAHAHA!!)  There's a wagon wheel in the wigwam!!!!  (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! OOOOH!

They would have just roasted him over the fire and eaten him, and blown up his bladder to use it as a ball to play Lacrosse.  Taylor Hicks is kind of weird, but he has his own style, which I admire.

"event","I sent ya'll a picture of James.  I know in the picture it looks like he's staring at Laura, which he probably was, but she doesn't live here anymore.  HAHAHAHA!!!

Carrie and I went out on Friday a few weeks ago to this bar in Santa Ana called Original Mike's.  I've been there before, but not for a long time.  Anyways, Carrie and I had a few drinks and were sitting outside when this server came over and asked if we wanted anything else.  We said no and that we'd be heading home soon.  He said, ""Aw, that sucks.  Well, have a good night!""  

Well, we decided to stay and have a few more drinks after awhile, so we went back inside and drank some more.  The same server walked passed us and threw his hand over his heart and said, ""Argh!! You just totally dissed me!  What the he**?  Outside you're all like, 'No, we're cool.' and now you're sitting here with more drinks!  That sucks!""  Then he sat down for a bit and started talking to us about his job etc.  Then he went back to work.

We went outside for a smoke, and by this point I was pretty far gone.  He came over and was like, ""Hey, ladies!""  I was all like, ""James, do you smoke?""  So, we lit him up and continued our conversation from before.  He asked us if we were from California...he could tell by our accents that we weren't, which is always embarassing.  Then we told him we went to a small Lutheran school in Minnesota, and he probably wouldn't know of it.  He did know, though!  He had gone to the Lutheran school in Garden Grove, CA and knew one of our friends from church.  Well, I was ecstatic, so I asked him if he liked baseball and would like to come to a game that his friend from school played in.  He was all like, ""Yeah, dude, that'd be awesome!""  So, I got his digits (this is Amy Reede we're talking about, right?)!

Anyway, we left him 2 messages on his phone that night, and then have gone back almost every Friday since to stalk him.  He always talks to us and even hung out with us after he was done working there.  He was driving this sweet red classic car and has a crazy side about him.

His pluses:  He's white, he's taller than me, he's cool, he has cool body ornaments, he knows what a Lutheran is, and he's funny.  It's just nice to have a kind of a friend here even if he doesn't like me like that, but I wouldn't be opposed if he did. Tee hee!

My plan:  continue to stalk him and try to find a way to ask him to do something with us outside of the bar...."

Laura came out to visit me over the weekend.  It was good to see her again, and we pretty much just talked and talked.  It's what we do best!  She's actually 90% sure she's coming back out here!!!  She hates teaching and wants to start working with animals, but first she needs to find out what exactly she wants to do, so she's going to waitress and work with different animal jobs until she finds what she's looking for.  

In other news, we've been hearing noises in the kitchen recently.  I thought wind was blowing on a plastic bag or something fell over in the cabinet, but NO.  WE HAVE A RAT IN THE HOUSE!!!  

Last night, Carrie was making cinnamon rolls and opened the cupboard above the stove.  She took out the flour to see a huge hole in the side of the bag.  She thought I had done it, and was kind of ticked, since flour was all over the place.  Then she took out the brown sugar, sugar, and Crisco...the same.  I said, ""OH MY GOSH, IT'S A RAT!""  and proceeded to throw my silverware on the floor and jump on the couch. 

I called our landlady, but didn't know if it was a maintenance emergency, so I left a message.  Carrie taped the door shut, and I called my dad just to make him laugh that we had a rat in the house (at this point, I hadn't seen it yet).  As I was talking to my dad, we heard it running around in the cupboard eating more food.  I started screaming into the phone to my dad, but he couldn't understand me.  

Finally, we called the emergency maintenance number and our mechanic from church to help us.  Every time we walked on the floor, we'd scream with every step we took not knowing if it would jump out or if there were any rat babies or anything.

Finally, the landlady came over and filled the hole from the stove vent with steel wool and set glue traps, then Juan the mechanic brought poison and other traps.  Another maintenance guy is coming over today to repair the holes and look for the rat.  All I have to say is, I WILL NOT be touching a rat, dead or alive.  I can kill anything from spiders to cucarachas to egos, but I cannot handle a rat."

I went to a student's house for lunch.  She made us eat 5 enchiladas and a huge bowl of arroz con leche (like rice pudding).  We left carrying balloons and mangoes across the street.  Quite a spectacle.

That night, we had a party for the ESL students.  We played Valentine bingo, stack the conversation hearts, and pick up conversation hearts with chopsticks.  It was actually quite fun.  Then we had even MORE food:  pizza, fruit, cheesecake, 2 jellos, salad, candy, ugh!  I felt sick by the end of the night, but how do you say no when all your students are standing there waiting for you to taste their food?  

We also got lots of gifts.  I got a weird squishy doll that giggles, 3 hideous sparkly heart sweaters, 2 skanky tops, 3 boxes of stale chocolate, and a big bunch of heart balloons....I do not want to celebrate Valentine's day again very soon to say the least."

One of our members asked the pastor if he could give $1500 to pay the coyote to get him back over here, but our pastor said no since that would be exceedingly illegal.

While they were here, we went to the Crystal Cathedral, Downtown Disney, San Diego Zoo, Hollywood, the Jay Leno show, Huntington Beach, and Old Towne Orange (all within 10-50 minutes from my house).  Now, I have to re-learn what working is.  My parents were kind enough to come to some of my classes with me and to help out with the students.  I even took them to a students'house for REAL Mexican food.  

It's been great reading all of your journals.  Sorry I've been so absent lately.  So much has been going on!  I feel like I'm losing my brain sometimes.

Best quote of the Jay Leno show by Dennis Miller, ""You know how they want to build a wall between the US and Mexico?  Well, I think they should get the illegals to build it and then nudge them over just before the wall is finished.""    ...it's probably only funny if you work with them....I don't know."

Pan de Vida isn't doing so financially well right now.  We are funded by the Synod for the building, but are also supposed be getting donations from a private offering.  We just found out that the people in charge of the donations haven't made a single payment for the last 5 months and we're very short on funds for the building.  The only way to alleviate that without other help is by not calling a 2nd pastor, but that would be devastating to our people and our program.  ANY donations we receive will be matched by other sources, so if there's anything anyone can do to help us out, that would be great.  We're just trying to stay afloat.  Don't tell too many people about this because we're not trying to beg for money or make it publicly known, and I know all churches have financial problems of their own, but we really do need help.

We had a forum after church yesterday to evaluate our church and its workers and to make a list of qualifications for the next pastor.  Overall I think it went very well and I was so proud to witness the spiritual growth that they have.  Rev. Wagenknecht and Rev. Wiedmer were there to observe, since they're on the mission board.  I think they were very impressed as well.  Some things did not go over so well.  

You know how there always seems to be a ""loud minority"" in the congregation that causes conflict that no one wants to deal with?  Well, it happened again yesterday.  Really only 2 families in the church are disruptive, and they're the first to complain or point the finger, but the last to help or give a solution.  They said some pretty mean things about Rev. Schroeder's wife that she didn't even know Spanish and she wasn't a good piano player, and it really hurt her feelings.  I knew you both would understand, because stuff like that has happened to us, too.  If I would have been in the room at that point, I would have said something, but I wasn't.  They don't realize how difficult it is to live here, sometimes.  Kara has given up her culture to come here and worship in a different language.  She has small children, which have prevented her from learning more.  She understands almost everything but is just timid to speak sometimes.  Still, she introduces herself to everyone with a smile on her face, helps out with everything that needs to be done, and never complains.  Learning a language is extremely difficult, and the fact that we live in the United States and nearly none of our members speak English is something they should also take into consideration.  Sorry, I just had to rant and rave a little bit.  I know it's not the majority of people that feel that way, but those words will hurt her for a long time especially cuz they're things she already knows and feels bad about and they said them right in front of her face.  Sometimes these people have no tact.

As for the rest of the meeting, it went pretty well.  Sometimes people were a little ignorant in their thinking, but it was good to see our church body actually becoming a CHURCH not just some random people sitting in a school together.  We also had one of our members lead it, and we're hoping to create an actual council pretty soon with him as president.  He was a great facilitator and tried to keep everyone on track.

So, that's my news for now.  Hope to hear from you soon!"

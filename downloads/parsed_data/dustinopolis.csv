Also, if anyone knows who did a ska/punk cover of this posts song, I'd appreciate it. I found it tagged as Reel Big Fish, but that isn't right. I've also heard Me First & the Gimme Gimmes and Save Ferris mentioned, but I don't think it's either of them either."

The Burlington Mardi Gras parade is this Saturday at 3pm on Church St. I am very close to Church St., so if anyone wants to stop by either before the parade, after, or later on in the day, please do. I've invited some other friends to stop by too, so the more the merrier! You can reply or give me a call if you know you're coming by. If you're more inclined to wait until the last minute, then feel free to take your chances and stop in. In case you were wondering, the place is at 12 Clarke St. apt. #4.
Looking slightly further into the future, my birthday is 2/28, so I'm thinking of having a shindig here the night of 2/29. I'd like to have as many people here as possible, so please try to make it and let me know either way. Just think, you won't be able to celebrate on the 29th again for 4 years!
I look forward to seeing you all in the near future,

"event","Hey, it's me, I'm back. My sporadic livejournaling continues. 

I'm in a commedia dell'arte troupe called CommediaVT with a bunch of fun people, and our first show is this weekend. An original show written, directed, and performed by members of the group, it's known as What's In The Box? For those interested, we will be performing at a fair in Jericho, VT. While not a religious event, the fair is located on the grounds of the Good Shepard Lutheran Church located on VT 15. It runs from 10 AM to 5 PM with lots of shows, food and other stuff going on. We will have two performances: 11 AM and 2:30 PM. The show runs approximately 40 minutes and is ridiculously funny. There's no admission, the whole shebang is absolutely free (except for food). So if you find yourself in the area, or bring yourself to the area, come check it out.

Also, if you're into that whole laughing thing, in addition to seeing What's In The Box? you should also check out Hot Fuzz if you haven't already and it's still playing near you. Easily one of the best movies of 2007 so far. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Spider-Man 3. Not worth the cost of a movie ticket. Spend the money you would spend on that on Hot Fuzz instead. Or a couple gallons of gas to drive to Jericho.

On an unrelated note, congratulations to the SMC Class of 2007! Good luck, and enjoy the six months you have before you have to start paying student loans!"

"event","Hello to everyone out there in livejournal world that hasn't heard from me for a while. Actually, I think it's been almost a year exactly since my last substansive post. So here I give you the year in review. 
Spring semester I was in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, Comedy of Errors, and JvL's senior sem Commedia Dell Farte`, a sketch comedy and improv show. I also performed in two improv shows with Rough Edges, a competition with JvL, Pat, and Mike, representing Rough Edges, and a solo competition. 
I graduated in May. That was one of the most intense weeks of my life. In addition to graduation, I attended 3 funerals/ memorial services within 1 week. RIP Auggie Carbunari, Harland Tatro, and Rita Terry. 
I worked for the Vermont Democratic Party during the election. My official title was Regional Field Organizer for Franklin and Grand Isle Counties for the Vermont Democratic Party. Basically I talked to people about helping to get all of our Democratic candidates (and Bernie) elected. We did pretty well. One of the states often targeted as being the most liberal re-elected the Republican Governor and Lieutenant Governor, but at the same time, there's now the first ever socialist in the Senate, and another Democrat in the House. Our majorities in the State House and Senate were increased, and we won every local seat in the counties I was working on. 
Also, I am now an elected official myself. I won one of Isle La Motte's three Justice of the Peace spots, in a race with five people. So if anyone wants to get married, let me know. I'm a notary too, since I had to become one for work. So I can officialize things too. 
What else? I saw Zox at Higher Ground, and Reel Big Fish, MXPX, and Streetlight Manifesto in Montreal. Both shows were great, especially the Montreal show, where we got in free and got to meet all three bands after the show. 
The holidays with the family went well. I'm currently seeking employment. I'd like to be able to use my diploma, but if it's interesting and pays well enough, I'll do almost anything. So if anyone knows about any good jobs (regardless of where they are) please let me know.
See you next year!
-Dustinopolis"

I make no promises for next semester. I'm going to be in 2 plays, both of which you should come see. Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, and Comedy of Errors. Gotta squeeze in everything I can before graduation. In addition to classes, I'm also going to have an internship, run the College Dems, be in Rough Edges (which hopefully will have some performances), be on the WWPV e-board, and have a radio show (or two?). A recap of the year is to come, but it wouldn't be entirely prudent to discuss it before it ends, so that's something to look forward to. Take care everyone, and have a Happy New Year!"

"event","Tomorrow's my last day at work and I'm moving home on Sunday. Then 3 weeks later I do the whole thing in reverse. Since my last post I've seen Stones In His Pockets and Brighton Beach Memoirs which were both phenomenal. I've decided that I liked the acting better in Stones, but the script better in Brighton. Stones only had 2 people, but they each played around 10 characters and it was hilarious to watch them transition back and forth. I liked the sets on both, even though they were fairly opposite. The first was almost bare, while the second was relatively elaborate. I hoping to see I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change this weekend. I also saw Little Mouse, which was very entertaining. Mike Mosey as a duck was worth the price of admission (which isn't very much, and is even less if you know the right people). Last weekend I went to a stage combat workshop Friday night and then saw Batman Begins on Saturday. A good weekend overall. Tomorrow night one of my best friends from hs is coming to visit for the night while he's in the area, and Saturday night I'm heading down to Mike's birthday bash in NH. I'm looking forward to the school year starting and moving into 320, but right now it's time for lunch."

"event","I saw Big River on Saturday, and it was good; I especially enjoyed the music. From there I went home and had a home cooked meal (so much better than summer Alliot). Sunday I headed to Rouses Point to see the parade and watch the fireworks, and I got to see a bunch of my friends from high school that I hadn't seen for a while. I got to hang out with AJ and Lauretta, who're engaged and asked me to be one of their ushers at the wedding, so that should be cool. Yesterday I went with the family over to Alburg to go to the parade and then the chicken barbeque. I had to head back to SMC last night due to having to work at 8, where I currently am. I met my new roommate last night and he seems really nice, hopefully we'll get along well."

The weekend before last was the VT City Marathon in Burlington; Carl, Melissa, Ellie and I got up early and went down to cheer on Erin who ran in it. She finished in under 4 hours too, I was impressed. Later, I went with Erin, Heather, and Shaleen (they came up for the weekend) to Mike McCarthy's place for his graduation/21st birthday party. Mike White made the drive out with one of his friends, and Holly was there too. In addition I got to meet a lot of Mike's local friends. 
 This past weekend I went out to Johanna's camp for a bonfire with Mike Mosey, Carl, Pat, Jo, Johanna, and their brothers (Jo and Johanna's). Saturday night Nick, Carl, Melissa, Ellie and I went to the outdoor mini-golf place in Essex. I didn't do that well, but it was still fun. Sunday night there was a quick game of risk (yeah, right); last night I visited Kirstin's first radio show to make sure everything went smoothly, which it did of course. I have my first radio show of the summer tonight from 8-10. Everyone should listen in; if you aren't in the area you can find the webcast at wwpv.smcvt.edu. And now I leave you with a quiz.

"event","So I finally have the time and the ambition to update this. I suppose I should pick up where I left off, which was half a semester ago. For spring break I went to NYC for a service trip. We stayed in Astoria, in Queens, and took the subway to and from work every day in Manhattan. It was a good experience, and the last day before we left we had off to explore the city. Let me tell you, we put our metro passes to good use. 
 The weekend after spring break was Easter weekend. Thanks to planning far ahead, Pat, Jo, JvL, Christina, and I had tickets to Spamalot on Broadway a week after it opened. We drove down on Friday and saw the show that night. I was really good, with all sorts of original songs. After the show we waited outside the stage door and met Tim Curry, David Hyde Pierce, and Hank Azaria (who were all in show). I got a picture with Hank Azaria and he did his Chief Wiggum voice which was cool to see. Fred Willard also came out of the stage door and I got a picture with him too. He wasn't in the show, but he was there to see it, so that was an added bonus. In addition to those, Bob Saget was there and I met him too. It was a good night overall. We drove out to Christina's house to sleep there and came back the next day. Right after I got back I went home for Easter, even though I didn't have much time there.
 We went through housing lottery, and I was lucky to pull a ridiculously good number yet again. I'll be living in TH 320 with Mike Kelley, Mike White, and JvL. We bought Jon Hart's bar and we should have a grill, so it'll be a good time. Visitors are always welcome.
 What took up a lot of my time for the a good part of the semester after that (besides homework/finals) was my campaign. I ran for Vice President of the Student Association against Dave O'Connor and Greg Tobey. Dave was running on a ticket with Tyronne; Greg and I were running independently. In order to get my name out there and see what people really cared about I knocked on doors throughout the campus. I went everywhere: the quad, the new buildings, founders, hodson, the 1s,2s,3s,4s, and every residential building on north campus. I got a lot of positive feedback from people who I hadn't met, but respected me for getting out there and doing this. I had to write and deliver a speech to the SA in Alliot and answer all of everyone's questions, and I thought I did pretty well at this. Everyone agreed I had the best slogan of everyone running: Trust In Dustin. That was the one I used the most, but there were others: DB for VP; If you want it truly, vote for Bruley; Don't be unruly, vote for Bruley (thanks to Mike and Pat for those last 2). I didn't however, use Chris's suggestion: If you've got a lustin', vote for Dustin. Despite my arsenal of slogans I came in 2nd in the race (Tyronne and Dave both won). I feel good about the experience though; when I came to college I would've never voluntarily given a speech to as many people as I did, and I've been getting consistently better about that sort of thing. I credit improv for helping me.
 I stayed on-campus after finals to work senior week and witness the craziness, capped by the bonfire. I also went to the opening night/midnight showing of Star Wars Episode III at the Essex outlets the night before graduation. Filling the row there was Kirk, his wife, Dave Volpe, Joe Guarino, JP, Meg Symington, Pat, Jo, JvL, Kirsten, and myself. That was fun and the movie was good, even if I didn't get much sleep. I had to get up early to help set up for the graduation. Congratulations class of '05! 
 Later I had to move my stuff out of Pontigny and over to Joyce, where I'm living for the summer. I went home for the weekend, but came back on Tuesday. I'm working 40 hours a week at the library this summer. Half of that is helping to get books ready to go on the shelves, which is pretty boring. The other half is working at the desk. Today I'm the only one working all day (9-5) bc. it's so slow. I don't this though, bc. it gives me time to do things like finally update my livejournal. I also started reading The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy today since I've never read it. I've only read 1 chapter so far, but I like what I've seen. Since I've been back on campus I've played a bunch of poker, some risk, and trivial pursuit. We'll see what tonight brings."

"event","Almost everyone is gone. With the exception of people going on service trips, the campus is almost empty with people now home (or wherever they went) for spring break. I'm going on a service trip to NYC, but it doesn't leave until Sunday morning, so it will be even more desolate tomorrow night. Tonight I watched Amelie with Mike, Neil, and a few of the girls in 203. I hadn't seen it before, but it pretty good, if a little odd. This week has been Hell academically; I had a midterm on Monday, 2 essays due for a take-home midterm on Wednesday, and a 6-page paper due today. Thankfully now that's over, but I've got another big paper due soon after break. Side note: I'm watching Conan, and he just had the Walker, Texas Ranger lever. Anyway, on my birthday Chris, Michelle, and I went downtown and got a drink. Then we came back and I had one with Jeff. We had a party here to commemorate the occasion on Saturday night. Everyone was drinking and having fun, and overall it was a success. Now I'm going to head for the bed to make up for the sleep I didn't get last night."

Our suite basketball team (the God Squad) finished the regular season 5-3. The playoffs start in a little over a week and we're hoping to win. This weekend is President's Day weekend so we have today and tomorrow off. On Friday after class I went with the drama club to NYC for the first time. I got to see Times Square at night and day, Central Park, Radio City, and a bunch of other landmarks. On Saturday we saw the new musical version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels on Broadway. I wasn't sure how it would live up to the movie, but it was really good and I highly recommend it. I got back late Saturday night exhausted but I had a great time. Last night I watched Donnie Darko and Van Wilder again with Jeff, Johanna, Mike, Mike, and Marissa. Today I got up early and went skiing for only the second time with Jo, Pat, and Christina. We're still supposed to play poker tonight, but I don't know if we actually will. In 1 week I'll be 21, let the countdown begin."

I was the captain of a floor hockey team, and we didn't win it all, but we made it a ways. On the night of the Christmas Formal, Pat, Jo, Christina, JvL, and I went bowling dressed formally. That night at midnight JvL turned 21 so he went to the bar there and got a drink. After we got back, JvL, Jo, and I played Risk until the wee hours of the morning. 
The end of the semester was somewhat stressful. I had 4 tests and 3 papers due within the last 2 weeks. But everyone survived and now it's time to get ready for next semester. Well, maybe not now, but in a few weeks. 
I found out that I'll be going to the American College Theater Festival in Rhode Island the 3rd week of January with the Saint Mike's group, so I'm excited about that. Over spring break I'll be doing an extended service trip in New York City, and the next weekend after I get back (the beginning of Easter break) I'll be going back with Pat, Jo, JvL, and Christina to see Spamalot on Broadway. This should be really cool bc. I've never seen a Broadway show before, and this one has Tim Curry, Hank Azaria, and David Hyde Pierce, among others. 
I had a good Christmas with lots of food, family, and...presents (I couldn't think of a f word for presents, so much for alliteration). I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas, Happy Chrismahanakwanzaka, and if you don't celebrate those then I hope you enjoyed yourself anyway."

A little while later I stopped by the Billy Collins event at the chapel and listened to him read some of his poems. Then I went to the gym to meet other people for basketball. Friday night brought us outside to throw the glow-in-the-dark frisbee around even though it was literally freezing cold. After warming up this was followed by video games. Saturday afternoon was time to go back to the gym for more basketball. Saturday night I went over to Mike & Mike's in Hodson with Pat & Christina for their party. Jungle juice was served, music was played and a good time was had by all, or at least most. Sunday was supposed to be our basketball tournament, but it turned out to be next Sunday. Last night I hosted my weekly radio show and got a few calls from people in Burlington that were randomly listening and liked what they heard. It's always nice to get compliments from strangers. It's also good to know that people outside of the campus are actually listening. Today Colin was at improv. He's back up for a few days which is awesome (like 1,000 hot dogs). We now return you to your regularly scheduled livejournal reading, already in progress."

"event","This is just a random few things that I'm posting about. 
This definitely isn't all that important, but apparently Reebok is bringing back the pump sneakers like they had in the late 80s-early 90s. But they don't actually have the pump on the outside, they automatically pump when you walk I guess, they're called Pump 2.0. The whole reason they're doing it though is to capitalize on the nostalgia of my generation. I think it's pretty safe to say that everyone who reads this is in the same generation as I am. Does anyone else feel a little weird that companies are bringing things back so that people who are 20 will be nostalgic? The TV shows we watched when we were kids are now on Nick at Nite; that makes me feel much older than I actually am.
Second thing. If you're going into a building and someone, regardless of who it is, is a short distance behind you, is it or is it not the right thing to do to hold the door for that person? I had thought that it was a good thing to do that didn't cost anything other than a few seconds, and most of the time it's usually met with a smile and a thanks. So how rude do you have to be, if someone's holding the door for you, to go to the other door that's right next to it, open that one, and go through without even acknowledging that person? Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd appreciate any feedback people have.
On a different note, today will be the first day for registration for Juniors. They split all the grades into A and B to try to ease congestion on the server so that there won't be any broken pipes, but I haven't heard how it went for the seniors. I'm in the B group, so I don't go until Friday at 7am, but they swore that there will be just as many classes available then as there will be today bc. they're holding some spots open. There better be.
Lastly, Yasser Arafat died. I don't really know what to think, bc. I was never really sure how much he was actually controlling suicide bombers in Israel. It will be interesting to see what happens there and if things get better or worse.
Oh, one more thing. Apparently Jo partied with Tom Ridge. Weird."

"event","I tried updating since the election before this, but livejournal lost it, so here I go again. My mood since the election has gone from pissed, to depressed, to accepting, back to pissed; read on. My other post was about how George W. Bush won the election because there were gay marriage ban initiatives on the ballot in 11 states, and 10 of them passed by an overwhelming majority. The idea that depriving someone who's an American citizen of their rights doesn't seem like a ""moral value"" to me, but I suppose we've done it before as a country and eventually gotten things right, so hopefully we'll get this right eventually too. However, it might not be the fundamentalist Christian vote that put Bush over the top, it might have been the voting machines. Last night I was told about 2 websites, www.democraticunderground.com and www.blackboxvoting.org (www.blackboxvoting.com also has a lot of information). These talk about the fact that in states where black box/ touch-screen voting machines were used, there were large discrepancies between the exit polls and the actual turnout. Since there is no paper trail on these electronic machines, there's no way to verify the results. On the other hand, in the states where paper ballots (which can easily be verified) were used, there were very small discrepancies. Before the election the head of one of the companies that makes a lot of the machines used (Diebold) promised that he would do everything he could to give the election to George W. Bush. In addition to this, on Friday there was a screening on-campus of the movie Unprecedented, which documents the voting shenanigans that took place in Florida in 2000, and one of the officials they talked to about touch-screen voting said that because he knew about the code, he could press some of the buttons at the same time and change the outcome of the election on that machine to make it for whoever he wanted. The only person in the media who has even picked up this story a little is Keith Olberman on his show Countdown on MSNBC. The mainstream media is either to scared to report it or has a vested interest in it not being reported. They only way to get this addressed is to get enough people talking about it and complaining about it, to other people, to the media, to our elected officials in Washington and elsewhere, faster this spreads the better, because we're running out of time. Apparently, an opposing politician's concession speech isn't legally binding. the only thing that is is the vote totals. In other words there's still time to keep Bush out of office for the next 4 years. Even if that can't be accomplished, at least his ""mandate"" can be taken away.
In local elections, Clavelle (the Democratic challenger for Gov.) and Rivers (the Democratic challenger for Lieutenant Gov.) pretty much got their asses handed to them. People are speculating that now that Clavelle's got his name out more he might try for statewide office again in '06. There's also speculation about Jeffords not running for re-election in the same year. If that were to happen, it would create a window of opportunity for several of VT's more prominent politicians. Possibilities include Bernie, Gov. Douglas, Clavelle, Dean, and anyone else that wanted to try to go for it. If Bernie went for it, that would open up his House seat to the same people. In addition, this will probably be Leahy's last term, so in 6 years, VT politics will look a lot different. Dean might not factor into it if he chooses to go for a different post. I've heard he's considering going for the leadership of the DNC, which would be awesome, but I'd prefer President Dean in '08. To get back to elections that have already taken place, the Republicans won the state auditor's office, but the Democrats were able to get control of the House. So the Gov. and Lt. Gov. are rep. but both houses of the Legislature are dem. It should be interesting. 
In personal news, I had an enjoyable weekend. Friday night after watching Unprecedented and the 3-on-3 tournament, there was beirut playing in the suite. Pat and I (who had never played before) played against Mike and Allen (who had). Pat and I used grape soda, Mike used Coke, and Allen used beer. In a best of 3 match, they won the first game by 3, we won the second by 6, and they won the third by 1. 
On Saturday, Allen, Eric and I went to the gym and got in 5 games of racquetball. I didn't win any of them, but I'd only ever played a few times before that. At night, Pat, Eric, JvL, Jo, and I went to Yankee Lanes for the galactic bowling. I didn't do all that great, but I got 2nd in the 1st of 4 games. I also found out that I had my appendix out, so thank you to everyone who sent me their best wishes. Unbeknownst to me, Heather, Ashley, Nathan, and James were there too, along with several people that I didn't know. I hadn't seen any of them for a while, so I was happy to get a few minutes to talk to them. Today Nathan goes back for his final training things before going to the Middle East for a year. First to Kuwait and then into Iraq. I'll be praying for him and I'm sure he would appreciate the prayers of anyone else who remembered. After getting back from bowling, we played some Soul Caliber 2 with JohnDon.
On Sunday Chris, Carl, Allen, Pat, JvL, Christina, and I got in an hour of basketball. There was also homework and stuff.
Yesterday I had to deliver the Shakespearean monologue that I had been assigned, and I was told that that was the best that I had ever done it, so I was pumped about that. Then we started talking about impersonations and I busted out the Clinton and people were impressed. I went out to dinner with the family, and got back in time to see Shenandoah Shakespeare Express perform 12th Night. There always reliable to be entertaining. Afterward I got to say hi to Kirk, which is always good since I never see him anymore. I knew the show would run past 8, so I had Pat covering for me on WWPV, but it ran about an hour longer than I thought it would, so I didn't get there until almost 9:30. That's pretty much it, except that yesterday was the first snow of the winter, and most of the people I know were excited. It's snowing lightly again right now, but none of it's sticking. Leave comments as you see fit and I'll keep you posted."

"event","...and I'm back. Since my last post was about election day, I'll use this one for other updating. Last week the Boston Red Sox won the World Series in a 4-game sweep. It seems to me that if the Red Sox of all teams can sweep the Series, then anything's possible. I day of game 4 I said they were going to win. Before that point I didn't think they had a chance, but I realized that this is the year of Boston. It started with Kerry miracurously snatching the Democratic nomination away from Dean. Then the Patriots won the Superbowl, again. The DNC was held in Boston. Then the Sox won the World Series. Today Kerry's going to continue the trend and win the election. Actually, I also have a theory that Kerry is the political mirror of the Red Sox this year. Kerry was the underdog against Dean and won the nomination and is going up against the other party. The Red Sox were the underdogs against the Yankees and beat them to go up against the other league. And we all know what happened there. The party/riot/group of people that assembled in the quad after game 4 was about the same size as after game 7 in the previous series. Several people had brooms (bc. of the sweep) including Allen, and there were several chants, such as ""Hell froze over!"" Last Saturday was the Halloween Dance which was a lot of fun. Mike, Pat, and I made it over there shortly after midnight after checking out the band at Dan Drew's for a while. They were pretty good, and it was cool to see an unknown band in such a small setting. What's becoming a partially recurring trend on the weekends is getting the projector from the library and hooking it up to either the Gamecube or the PS2 and playing games projected on the wall of the suite. For anyone who hasn't tried this, I highly recommend it. It's almost noon, so I'm going to go get something to eat. You might want to do the same."

"event","So today's election day. I sincerely hope people vote, but also that they inform their vote. If everyone in the country did those two things it would make me happy. Granted, I would rather people vote for one over the other, but at least if everyone voted and knew why they were voting for that person that would be something. To quote Russell's away message, quoting P. Diddy, ""Vote or die, bitches!"" The other popular political away message today is ""Remember, support abstinence this election day: vote no Bush, no Dick 2004!"" My prediction is Kerry wins 288-250 electoral votes. We'll see how close I am. The races to watch in VT are Governor and Lieutenant Governor, since Senate, House, and Presidential races are in the bag here. It looks like Douglas is going to win another term, but I think Clavelle can still pull it off. The same thing goes for Dubie and Rivers. I've got to do some work now (seeing as that's where I am), so I'll finish the updating later."

"event","I haven't updated for a little while, so I'll try to hit the high points of the last two weeks. I came back from Columbus Day break on that Monday. On Tuesday I went with a bunch of people from here down to NH to the nearest Bush/Cheney '04 office to protest outside of it. It's interesting that the office is on the fourth floor of a building downtown that isn't marked at all. Almost as if they don't want anyone to know that they're there. We met some Middlebury students and there was around 30 people total. Bush is silent on AIDS and won't allow people at campaign stops to ask him questions about it, and 8,000 people die every day because of it. Everyone dressed in all black and we put black duct tape over our mouths and marched from the corner to his office building, while one person counted the number of people who died while we were walking. After we got there everyone ripped off the duct tape and started chanting. Eventually a couple bike cops showed up and said we couldn't march in a circle on the sidewalk because we were obstucting sidewalk traffic or something but we could march up and down the sidewalk, which doesn't make any sense. It didn't really make a difference because we were winding down anyway. It was relatively succesful, with some media there (front page of the defender) and some people shooting a documentary movie. After we were done they talked to me and a girl from Middlebury and we had to sign release forms. 
Shortly after I got back to campus, I went downtown to a rally welcoming Elizabeth Edwards to Burlington. There were a bunch of other politicians there including Pat Leahy as planned and a surprise visit by Howard Dean. He had the best line of the night; here's an exerpt from the Burlington Free Press: Dean, speaking to the crowd at Union Station as it waited for her arrival, was talking about how well he thought John Edwards did during his debate with Vice President Dick Cheney. ""What a great contrast against Darth Vader over there on the other side,"" he joked. ""If Cheney had unwrapped his cape, his fangs would have shown.""
That night was also the first night of the ALCS- Yankees vs. Red Sox. After the Yankees had 3 big games, the campus was relatively silent, with the majority of students being Red Sox fans. However after game 7 when the Red Sox made one of the greatest comebacks in sports history, the campus erupted. There was a huge party in the quad. 4 or 5 police cars showed up, but there wasn't much for them to do; it was a very positive rally. Unlike last year when the Red Sox lost. Last night they beat the Cardinals to win game one of the World Series, so we'll see what role the Bambino plays this year.
Last weekend a bunch of us went to see Napoleon Dynamite. It's an odd movie, but definitely funny. For anyone interested, Jon Stewart's going to be on 60 Minutes tonight at 7. There's also going to be a debate between the 2 candidates for Governor of Vermont tonight in the theater at 8 which is going to be broadcast live on channel 3 after 60 Minutes. Of course most people will probably be watching game 2. 
This weekend was Centennial Weekend for the school. On Friday night the Centennial Ball was held. Most (thought not all) of my friends bought tickets and went. The food was better than Alliot and the Dave Grippo Funk Band kept people on the dance floor. I danced somewhat and apparently I'm actually good at it. Yesterday was the Centennial Convocation. It was very ceremonial with all sorts of people there. Pat Leahy, Bernie Sanders, Jim Douglas, Peter Clavelle, and even an official from Oxford were there to congratulate the school on 100 years. There was also the annual MOVE silent auction this weekend, with all sorts of things from school items to food to stuff from India and Africa. 
I think that's enough for now, this post is long enough."

The dot over the letter 'i' is called a tittle. 
Alfred Hitchcock didn't have a belly button. It was eliminated when he was sewn up after surgery. 
A pregnant goldfish is called a twit. 
The longest word in the English language, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. The only other word with the same amount of letters is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconioses, its plural. The longest place-name still in use is taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwenuakitnatahu, a New Zealand hill.

So I'm living in Pontigny Hall this year which is nice seeing as it's a new building, and the whole suite thing works out pretty well. I'm living with friends, which makes it even better. We ended up with an open room and got a transfer student from NJ named Chris who gets along really well with all of us. 
I'm taking 16 credits this semester, and that's working out well so far. I'm still in Rough Edges, the Saint Michael's College Democrats, and the Student Global AIDS Campaign. I'm also trying to fit in the political science club. I ran for President of Pontigny Hall and the election ended Friday but I haven't found out if I won or not yet. I also have a radio show which is currently unnamed (suggestions anyone?) on Mondays from 8-10 pm. You can tune to 88.7 fm or go to http://wwpv.smcvt.edu/ and click on the button for the webcast to hear the show anywhere in the world. Last week was my first show and it went really well. Hopefully tomorrow's show will be just as good. For anyone who wants to call in the # is (802)-654-2887. 
A few weeks ago the 2nd Annual SMC 24-Hour Play Festival was held. I worked with 3 other people in writing one of the plays which came out great when staged. Last weekend I, along with 11 other people in 3 cars, went to Montreal. It didn't turn out quite like we planned, but we learned a few things from it. We were going to go to a club, but after it took us 4 hours to make the 2 hour trip, we ended up going to a bar/restaurant and then walking around the city for a little. We've had several birthdays celebrated, including Allen's 21st, Mike's 21st, Steve's 20th, and Christina's 20th. If anyone wants to tell me when their birthday is, I'll be happy to wish them a happy birthday when it comes around. I got a postcard from Mira straight from Prague last week, which completely made my day. I'm gonna get something out to her soon. I think that's probably enough for now, I'll try to update more regularly in the future."

"event","I had an excellent day today. For starters, I didn't have to work. I was taking the morning off anyway and my boss said that it would be easier for scheduling for him to just take the whole day off. In case anyone was wondering I took the day off to go see the Stanley Cup. For those not familiar with professional hockey, the Stanley Cup is a cup that was presented by Lord Stanley to the winner of one of the first hockey tournaments back in the late 1800s (I think) at some point when Canada was still a colony of England. Since then every team that has won the NHL Championship gets their team name and the names of all the members engraved onto the cup. Due to this, it's grown about 3 feet and 20 pounds since it was first presented. This is what makes it such a special trophy, rather than other sports where a new trophy is presented every year, this one is passed from team to team over the years. The tradition is that every player on the team gets it for one day to do what they want. Since the Tampa Bay Lightning won this year and Martin St. Louis is on that team and he went to UVM and has a home in Burlington, the cup came to Vermont for a few hours today. The event was held at a hotel in Burlington and the doors were supposed to open at 8:30 am. So I got up when I normally do and got down there at 7:45 to get a good place in the line (which was huge). I don't know why, but they decided to open the doors at 8, so everyone got in quicker than they expected. They didn't allow for individual pictures with St. Louis and the cup, but they would take about 10 people in the line and send them over and have everyone give their cameras to some hotel staff people and they would take all the pictures. Then they would take about 10 more people and so on.
Because of all this I was out before 9 (which I wasn't planning on). So I decided to go to the mall, but first I needed to stop at the bank next to the mall and pick up a little cash. I headed that way and found that none of the traffic lights were working; I saw what anarchy supporters are always talking about, people using common sense and custom to figure things out. Anyway I went to the bank and found out that they were closed because there was no power in the area. The next closest atm being on-campus, I returned here. After a little while I made it to the mall, with power now restored. I hung out there for a while and then came back.
After my roommate got back from class he wanted to go downtown, bc. he hadn't been, so around 4:30 we headed out. After he realized that he forgot his wallet in the room and we returned and then returned to the city, we got something to eat. I was going to take him to a diner, but they were closing early, so we ended up eating at a Chinese food place. The guy working there apparently knew some Japanese, bc. he said good evening to my roommate in Japanese. Once finished we did a little shopping (and I introduced him to Ben & Jerry's) and we headed back. Work tomorrow and then home Saturday. I can't beleive it's only a month until I see everyone again.
P.S. I've got that new song by Snow Patrol stuck in my head, if anyone knows what it's called I'd like to know."

When I got back from work today I found a guy waiting to tell me he was moving in here, so I now have a new roommate. His name is Hirofumi but he goes by Hiro and he's from Japan. He got here at the end of last week, but I guess they put him in the wrong room for a few days. He'll be here until the end of the school year and then it's back to Japan. It's interesting to talk to him, comparing cultures. Tonight we were talking about superstitions, and I gave him a Mountain Dew since he had never heard of it. 
I've been watching the first night of the DNC tonight (yes I know, that's the cool thing for college guys to do). There have been some good speeches, especially Jimmy Carter's. Bill Clinton is on right now; he's a good speaker too, he just has a different style. When I was surfing the net over the weekend I saw some bumper stickers relavent to the election I hadn't perviously seen; one said ""Help the environment, plant a Bush in Texas"" the other said ""Re-defeat Bush.""

My job is to paint rooms, which isn't the most interesting job in the world, but not really boring either. My roommate and I didn't get along, but after a month or so he moved out, and I've had a double room to myself since then. On Tuesdays you can listen to my show on WWPV 88.7 fm from 8-10pm on the radio or the webcast if you're interested. There was some crap in Isle La Motte (to say the least), if you haven't heard about it here's the link: http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/specialnews/islelamotte/index.htm . That really messed with everyone in the town, since it's so small everyone knows everyone else. Anyway, the 4th of July weekend went relatively well. I got to see two parades, two sets of fireworks and Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels, which is a pretty good movie. Since then I've seen Snatch which is a similar movie, if you like one, you'll probably like both. I also saw 28 Days Later, which was pretty good too. As far as in-theater movies, I saw Super Size Me and Fahrenheit 9/11, which are both recommended. Tonight I played some poker and watched I Love the 90's, which is somewhat addictive (like a lot of things on VH1). Hopefully everyone's having a good summer, and if anyone has livejournal tips let me know."

     I love listening to things going on in your life.  It is never dull and I, often, find that you are saying things I wish I had the courage to say or that you seem to be in my head.  Often, I want to turn around and say, ""hey, get outta my head!""  But then I realize, ""hey, I'm not alone."" 
     Guess that's why you get the same feelings sometimes.  Let's not forget this and continue to grow together.  
     If you ever get out to Las Vegas, we'll have to get together for some healthy nosh.  Huggles!"

     Although we do not comment a lot on each other's journal, I know we read and care.  This is shown by the comments that are made.  
     You roxxers my soxxers because you face your trials and tribulations and do what you can to face and scream back at them.  You may bitch and moan sometimes, but it is always with reason and, often, I find you have found a solution or a reason and look back on them to move forward.
     I am glad to name you among my friends."

"event","Wow, seems like it's been a while since I properly updated with my life.  Things have been moving forward.  It feels hard a lot of the time, but that's to be expected.  It's life.  
     I've been keeping my mouth shut because I didn't want to jinx things.  J and I have been looking for a house since before October.  We have been under contract three or four times, each time, it fell through due to horrible sales agents.  I'd even gotten to the point where being under contract didn't mean that much to me anymore.  But, at the end of last month, we actually closed on a house!!!
     It was pretty much move in ready.  I picked up the keys one week, went back the next to change the locks (and take a couple boxes over) and found someone had broken in and stolen the thermostat from the wall.  The next week came back with a few more boxes and found they had come back and gone through some of my boxes.  Thankfully, I was smart and decided not to take any ""good"" boxes over.  So, we had our internet connection moved to the house the next day and J moved in.  So, while I packed up the condo, he was living there with no a/c for two weeks unpacking what I brought and living with no fridge or a/c.  But, he made it.
     Friday, the movers came and moved the big items and I went with.  We have ""officially"" moved in and replaced the thermostat so there is now a/c.  We've spent the weekend unpacking and still have the old place to go back for a few more things and clean.
     Since January, I've been working for Sprint in their call center.  I have been trained in four three areas, have worked in two and am preparing to move to a third!  I say, the more I can learn about the company, the more valuable I can become to them. 
     I've ended a friendship with someone who wasn't much of a friend.  They were a great person to party with, but anything deeper than that...simply not the type.  And I don't need drama in my life.
     Due to circumstances beyond my control, I seem to have lost or have a great separation growing between another friend.  I won't go into detail with this, but suffice to say, had I known what I know now, things would have been different and I apologize with all my heart that I did not.
     But, I seem to have replaced that one with a couple new ones who are more open to a deeper friendship.  So, I am happy and content at the moment and learning to move forward instead of deperately holding onto the past hoping it would make me happy.
     Thanks to faire visits and facebook, I've had the opportunity these last months to re-connect with old friends from before married life and from high school.  I've gotten to spend valuable time hanging out in ways I haven't before that were simply marvelous and which I look forward to getting to do again in the future.  
     Because of my new job, I have medical insurance and have begun to take better care of myself.  I am on new meds for controlling my diabetes.  This has meant better sugar levels and less injections.  If anythng, I've been combatting lows.  
     Unfortunately, as always, when I get into something I jump head first and got really sick because of it.  Two weeks ago, I went to get checked for a sore throat and ended up being placed on two bags of iv for dehydration.  I was also given meds to fight a throat infection (non-strep), a sinus infection and bronchitis.  Whoo hoo for days off from work.  Boo for having to pack and move during a time the doc wanted me on bed rest...lol  Such was life, but I'm much better at the moment. 
     So, there you have it in a bucket.  Lots going on, but overall a much happier me.  Love you all and hope all is well."

"event","<p>Last weekend, I was driving to faire with someone I thought was a true friend. On the way into faire, I mentioned how good it was to be back home. This person turns to me and says, &quot;You really are more of a rennie than you are a burner.&quot; What? The one has nothing to do with the other. They are both a part of my life and I feel they are both part of who I am. I am not more one than the other. <br /><br />Over the last week, I have been thinking about this statement due to many of this person's actions. Does being more of a burner mean I am allowed to have no respect for other people's time constraints and life commitments? Does being more of a burner mean I can act selfishly and expect others to commiserate with me when things do not happen to make me happy or when others get upset because of it? Does being more of a burner mean I can act like a 5 yr old? I don't believe so, because I have many other &quot;burner&quot; friends who don't act this way. However, I do know that this is not a person who deserves to be called my friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's sort of funny because my husband always gets on me about how unforgiving I am, how I am always quick to hold a grudge against those who make minor infractions that I feel have wronged me, yet I will defend to a fault anyone who makes a good first impression upon me, no matter how bad they can really be.&nbsp; And, for the first time, I can really see this.&nbsp; Because I did so for this person.</font><br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last October, I invited this person to come work with me at a booth at the LV ren faire.&nbsp; I am able to work out arrangements with friends to make sure we can camp onsite as this is part of the whole experience.&nbsp; This person asks me to see if I can stay on site until Monday morning.&nbsp; I tell her I need to be home early to be able to wash up and such before work as I had a student at 1pm. Not a problem they say.</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This person had a problem with their vehicle and I suggested they take the vehicle to my mechanic; which they did.&nbsp; This person tells me she can't pick it up until Monday morning.&nbsp; Ok, still not a problem, just make sure there is a ride available and pick it up early because I have work at one.&nbsp; Still told, not going to be a problem.</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come Monday morning, she and her new bf, were still sleeping the first couple of times I checked on them.&nbsp; A bit later, they were missing from their tent.&nbsp; When I spoke with campmates, they stated the two said they were off looking for me and pointed the direction they had headed, which was the opposite way from the direction they knew I had been the night before.&nbsp; I didn't see them again until nearly 10-11 o'clock.&nbsp; When I asked what was going on with the car was told they were working on the car issue and had a ride but had to tear the person's booth down before they could leave, but don't worry, I'll be home in time.&nbsp; Now, I live about 20 minutes from site and my student was about 20-30 minutes from my home.&nbsp; About 11:30, my husband calls to find out how much longer before I can get home for work (mind you, at this time, he was also the coordinator for my company.).&nbsp; He states he will come get me because it is starting to get close and he wanted to make sure I was on time to work.&nbsp; I am also panicking because I have been after this person about the time constantly being told not to worry it was going to be okay.&nbsp; About 5 minutes before my husband pulls up to site, this person finally leaves to go get the vehicle.&nbsp; And, to me, just couldn't grasp why I was so upset about possibly being late to work!</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, I defended this person time and again to my husband who just didn't want to let me go on trips dependant on this person because they seemed to have no respect for my time contraints.&nbsp; I thought this person was my friend and I would defend this person to the end.&nbsp; I understood they were more spontaneous than I can be.&nbsp; Not a problem to me, yet.</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This season for ren faire, I ask this person if they would like to join me in working big faire, something I knew they had been a part of and seemed to want to enjoy again.&nbsp; I stated they could probably work 8 hours per day since that is what I did last year and it was minimum wage plus tips, however my tips last year sucked.&nbsp; Also, stated that the booth provided us with lunches, some dinner and breakfast.&nbsp; Stated I would try to contact my boss there and work it out.&nbsp; This person agreed to work.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks, there were questions and issues about dates since there was a weekend committed to an event in LV, so I tried to contact this person.&nbsp; I called, left messages, spoke to one of this person's bf's stating I really needed to hear from this person and was told the message would be passed on, sent text messages and emails.&nbsp; I never heard back for near a month or so after the start of my first messages.&nbsp; The reasons given, they had a relationship issue they had to think about.&nbsp; Now, I really needed some confirmations because faire was coming up and if they were going to change their mind on me, I needed to make other arrangements to get to faire since so few people I know live here and drive in to L.A. for it.&nbsp; Ok, I dealt with it.&nbsp; Things seemed to get worked out.</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last weekend on the way to faire, we pull over halfway there to fill up.&nbsp; I really don't have the money.&nbsp; I think I had like 18 dollars on me.&nbsp; Ok, part my fault, we didn't clarify the arrangements on splitting the gas money.&nbsp; I knew I was going to, just had expected that I would pay when I received pay on Sunday night.&nbsp; Not the case, was told this person only had like 20-40 dollars for food and had planned on me paying for the tank here, where gas was 40 cents more per gallon than in town.&nbsp; Must use premium in this car.&nbsp; Ok, well, don't really have the money, but I'll try to put it on my debit card.&nbsp; done.</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, this person is trying to deal with some personal issues and our planned hosts for the weekend were going to attend an adult party on Sat.&nbsp; When I mentioned this to my driving host, they mentioned they really didn't want to attend so I agreed to make arrangements for us to stay at my father's.&nbsp; Now, my father was going to bring some insulin to me at faire on Saturday when he was attending with a friend, since we use the same kind and I really can't afford it even with my insurance, and I would have to keep it on ice at faire.&nbsp; However, when I made the arrangements for us to stay at his home on Sunday, made arrangements for me to just take it on Sunday, thus requiring less time to be kept merely on ice.&nbsp; I mentioned this to this person.&nbsp; As we were arriving at our Friday night's host home, they informed me that their event had been cancelled.&nbsp; My &quot;friend&quot; says, ok, let's just stay here that way I don't have to pack everything up to go to your dad's.&nbsp; now, I packed one small bag and my hoop for the trip because I know I was staying at people's and didn't want to carry to much and be burdened.&nbsp; This person packs the entire house and then some.&nbsp; I remind them that I have already made arrangements with my dad who was intending for us to have dinner with him as well.&nbsp; They made do, especially since our host's had us pull our faire stuff out and pack everything back into the vehicle before anything else.</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We go to faire on Sat where my booth has added an extra person and is trying to make smaller shifts, presumably because the girls who worked with me last year did not handle the shifts very well.&nbsp; Ok, doesn't seem to be a problem.&nbsp; We settle in to work.&nbsp; </font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should mention that the Monday before faire, I was put on new medications to deal with my diabetes, including a weight loss med because the doc wants me to lose weight.&nbsp; The medication is an amphetamine, so it causes my body to constantly tremble, especially during that first week on it.&nbsp; So, my body is pretty frackkin' tired by the end of my day.&nbsp; During the week, I am usually in bed by 8 since I wake at 3:30-4:00 am for work.&nbsp; So, you can imagine how early my day usually ends...lol</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, during this first day at faire, I tried to get exercise by walking the entire faire from back to front, then back again.&nbsp; Having opened my booth and working until 2:30, then returning at 6:30 to close it down since I am the only returning person.&nbsp; By the end of the day, I'm pretty frackkin' tired and starting to hurt since this is the first real exercise I have done while on these meds.&nbsp; This friend comes up to the main booth wearing their new &quot;faire bf's jacket&quot; stating that we should just stay onsite tonight since he wanted this friend to stay with him tonight.&nbsp; I state that I am really tired, really hurting, we had prior arrangements at my dad's (about 15 minutes away) and I had no bedding to camp onsite since we hadn't planned for it.&nbsp; Mentioned I have no problem staying onsite, but needed to know ahead so I could make arrangements for it.&nbsp; They seemed a bit pouty, but said ok, they needed to return the jacket to the bf.&nbsp; We ate dinner provided by the booth. It is already late, dark and getting cold and I have no cloak or nightwear since we hadn't made plans to stay onsite late.&nbsp; It's about 8/8:15 or so, by my recollection.&nbsp; This person goes off to return the jacket.&nbsp; I sit and wait with a couple people, who after a bit, ask me how long was I waiting, wasn't I getting cold, hadn't I mentioned I wasn't feeling well, etc.&nbsp; All of which was yes.&nbsp; They left and another person came up.&nbsp; She and I talked for about 20 minutes before she needs to take off.&nbsp; So, I sit there for a bit in the dark by myself since everyone else had wondered off for the night.&nbsp; I try calling this person, but their phone is in my basket with the rest of their belongings.&nbsp; Great!&nbsp; I look at my phone and it is already 9:38 and they haven't come back yet.&nbsp; Finally they come back saying how cute it was, the bf didn't want to let them go, kept pulling them back for kiss after goodbye kiss.&nbsp; (Um, gee, thanks.&nbsp; You knew I wasn't feeling well and didn't have warm clothing and kisses were more important.)&nbsp; Thank goodness someone had left their cloak and it helped a little, it was open on the sides.</font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning, my father gives us money to get coffee and outmeal at Starbucks.&nbsp; We get to faire and they take off to go see the bf.&nbsp; When they come back, breakfast had already been served, but I had saved a serving for them, just to make sure they had enough for breakfast.&nbsp; We set off for our respective shifts and such.&nbsp; This friend comes up and states they were told they needed something to wear specific to be allowed to sit in the bf's guildyard.&nbsp; As a result, they go and spend $150.00 on a new faire piece so they can sit in the guildyard.&nbsp; Thought you didn't have money for gas??&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; </font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we get to the end of the day.&nbsp; Pay is lesser than I remember because the shifts have gotten a little bit shorter.&nbsp; Ok, deal with it, because being at faire is the main reason I do this.&nbsp; I now have my basket full of my items since dad bought me a new one.&nbsp; I'm still trying to minimize my items because of how tired I am and how sore my muscles are from my meds and I have my box with the insulin and ice packs in it to carry to the vehicle out in left field.&nbsp; This friend starts putting their various items in my basket saying they had to carry their clothing (remember, they had a new outfit and had to carry the items they came in.).&nbsp; I mention I couldn't carry all of this.&nbsp; (If you wanted to put your stuff into a basket for easier carrying, why didn't you get one?&nbsp; They were only about 20-30 dollars depending on which one you got!)&nbsp; So, they finally grab my small insulin box and their clothing, but the rest of their stuff goes into my basket for me to carry to the car.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; </font></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Cut for longevity...I had to get it out somewhere...""><font style=""background-color: #ffffff"">On the way to the car, they start complaining about how little they got paid (looks like some hours might have been missed d/t this person having to write their hours in different places).&nbsp; They didn't check the money when they were with the bosses and didn't mention it before we walked out of site.&nbsp; I say just mention it and have them recheck.&nbsp; They get upset and say , &quot;You told me we were probably getting 8 hours a day.&nbsp; I only got 5!&quot;&nbsp; (Ok, probably, not Will. No promise I can see.)&nbsp; And the tips suck. (Um, i mentioned this in the beginning before you agreed).&nbsp; This doesn't cover my gas.&nbsp; It takes me three tanks to make the round trip. (I paid for at least one!) and on and on it goes.&nbsp; I finally give them $40.00 more.&nbsp; &quot;What's this for???&quot; (to shut you up so I can try to sleep, you know, part of our arrangement of my driving on Friday, where I let you sleep with no interruption, and you drive home on Sundays so I can sleep since I have to be up at 3:30-4am and it is already 8:30?)&nbsp; Now, I only had made about 30 dollars more than they did since I got the extra open/close hours for being the one returning member.&nbsp; They continue to go on and on about how they don't think they can continue to do faire unless they get at least 8 hours.&nbsp; This doesn't cover all three tanks or food. (Again, I paid for one tank so far, just gave you enough to cover a little over the second and you got free lunch both days, free dinner Sat and Free Breakfast Sunday.&nbsp; You didn't pay for food.)&nbsp; I say, then mention to them you need a few more hours, there is another booth to work.

I am not looking at anything with less than 3 bedrooms/1.5+ bath.&nbsp; I am not looking at anything with a less than spacious or with an ajoining space for my kitchen work.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am not looking at anything with mold residue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I&nbsp;can afford to be picky.

Have made some great new friends this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have made some acquaintances better friends. &nbsp;Have given up friendships with some. &nbsp;Am currently worried about some friends.

Am keeping better track of blood sugars. &nbsp;Am taking my morning shots.&nbsp;&nbsp;Am taking my sliding scale shots and attempting for the first time to count carbs and bolus accordingly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, lost a package with UPS for 5 vials of insulin and have to get those replaced, with no insurance.

Was a delegate to the state Democratic Convention&nbsp;for Nevada and had an adventure there.

Went camping with a great group of people this summer and can't wait for what the future has in store.

And actually had dinner and a night out with my mother without&nbsp; my being frustrated at her or being lectured at by her!

Sorry, just got back from karaoke with Mom and am tired, so my thoughts are a bit jumbled at the moment.

Oh. and made a great new friend, thanks to others, who enjoys karaoke and seems to share a like mind with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be interesting to see where this will take me!&nbsp; See ya on the flip side!!"

I have great friends here who listen to my rants and put me in my place or gives me the advice or hugs I need.  My parents are in good health.  I have a roof over my head and food for my belly.

PINK LYRICS

""Dear Mr. President""
(feat. Indigo Girls)

Dear Mr. President,
Come take a walk with me.
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me.
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly.

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President,
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb and we're not blind.
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell.

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine.

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Dear Mr. President,
You'd never take a walk with me.
Would you?"

I got a call this morning from my uncle.  He said my great-aunt was in Ca and her daughter had taken her to Stateline last night.  He gave me my second-cousin's cell number and I got in touch with them.  I was able to meet with them.

The last time I spent any time with this lady was when I was 14.  My dad had taken me back home to Joliet, IL where his side of the family resides.  I was able to spend a week at her home, see the family I never really knew I had and celebrate my Great-Grandfather's 99th birthday (his last.).  

I can't tell you how good I felt getting to spend the afternoon with my Great-Aunt and the rest of the family who were with her.  We saw a magic show and the tigers at MGM.  It was a good day.

Whoops, looks like I need to adjust the time and date stamp on my camera...lol"

"event","About&nbsp; a year ago, I went into the pet store to help my former supervisor with her volunteer group, F.L.O.C.K. (For the Love Of Cats and Kittens).&nbsp; When I got there, I found out the group was no longer at that location.&nbsp; However, Best Friends, another rescue group, was there.&nbsp; I had no ride until my husband was done working with a student so I made myself comfy and helped out.<br /><br />The in-house veterinarians brought out this tiny ball of darkness.&nbsp; They hadned her to me to hold and this baby kitten fell asleep in my arms.&nbsp; They told me her story.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />She had been abandoned in a shopping cart and placed in a far corner of the store.&nbsp; She had a neuro-muscular disorder that caused her front paw&nbsp;to be turned inward and be useless.&nbsp; The vet said they had given her a full examination and that was the only thing wrong with her.&nbsp; She needed a home because no one else could take her and they had had her for a week already.&nbsp; I got the okay and we took her home that day.<br /><br />From the beginning, she has always been a ball of energy.&nbsp; Rushing here and there.&nbsp; Jumping from one thing to another.&nbsp; Never really stopping.&nbsp; She will come to me when she wants to be held on the rare occasion, but she is a daddy's girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I&nbsp;try to pick her up, she just sits there for a split moment before jumping away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, tonight I was&nbsp;saying good night to a friend online&nbsp;who always gives me the sappiest good nights.&nbsp; So I decided to give her one in return.&nbsp; I pulled up the words to a&nbsp;tune that was a favorite wav of mine way back when.&nbsp; It is called the Cuppycake song.&nbsp; Here it is...<br /><br /><strong><center><font color=""#000099""><b><i><font size=""+1"">You're my Honeybunch, Sugarplum</font></i></b></font></center><center><font color=""#000099""><b><i><font size=""+1"">Pumpy-umpy-umpkin, You're my Sweetie Pie</font></i></b></font></center><center><font color=""#000099""><b><i><font size=""+1"">You're my Cuppycake, Gumdrop</font></i></b></font></center><center><font color=""#000099""><b><i><font size=""+1"">Snoogums-Boogums, You're the Apple of my Eye</font></i></b></font></center><center><b><i><font color=""#ff0000""><font size=""+1"">And I love you so and I want you to know</font></font></i></b></center><center><b><i><font color=""#ff0000""><font size=""+1"">That I'll always be right here</font></font></i></b></center><center><b><i><font color=""#ff0000""><font size=""+1"">And I love to sing sweet songs to you</font></font></i></b></center><center><b><i><font color=""#ff0000""><font size=""+1"">Because you are so dear</font></font></i></b></center><center><font color=""#ff0000""><font size=""+1""><font color=""#000000"" size=""2""><br /></font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></font></font><br />&nbsp;</center></strong><br /><br />Well, my little ball of energy mewed at me when I sang it to my friend.&nbsp; A little bit later, my husband had it stuck in his head and was trying to sing it.&nbsp; He didn't know the words, so I pulled them up again and started to sing them aloud.&nbsp; Again, Indy mewed.&nbsp; But, this time, she jumped up on my desk and crawled into my arms.&nbsp; I continued to sing the song as if in a loop to her.&nbsp; She just laid back in my arms and started to purr.&nbsp; I must have sat there for over 5 minutes with her in my arms, singing this little tune to her, purring away contentedly, as never before...<br /><br />I can't tell you how sweet a feeling that has come over me right now.&nbsp; As sick as I am and I feel like I am on top of the world...<br /><br />Good night all...<br /><br />"

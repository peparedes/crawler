"event","On Tuesday, when I got out of school, we loaded up...and left!! I was so excited...oddly me and my mom were getting along on the way there?? But when we were like 10 min. away from the exit, I called my grandpa and told him we were in Columbia~there was a lot of rain and like 5 wrecks (no lie).  And then when I pulled up in the driveway and went in the house they were all surprised (b/c grandpa believed me)...then we all hugged and all that good stuff.  Then we kinda stayed up a lil' late watching tv and chatting.  Then it was sleepy time for me...and when I woke up on Wednesday...mom said that everybody is suppose to get dressed b/c we had errands to do~GREAT...NOT!  So we went to the bank and mom stayed there for like and hour...then she had to go to the cemetary to check on my grandpa's thingy-but on the way there she stopped to see one of her friends-and I was getting mad and upset b/c she was seeing her friends and I wasn't allowed to see Kelly. Well, after they sayed good-bye we went to the cemetery and was in there for like 30 min. and came out crying b/c she sayed Grandpa's -whatever it is- is payed for! Then we left to go and eat- we went to Fazoli's and while we were there our car was at Cactus Car Wash.  When we were done we went to get the car and it looked goood! After that  we went to Wal-Mart to get somethings...and when you are w/ mom there expect to not leave...ever!!  But eventually we got out. And mom was wanting to try a new recipe that we had had on Grandma and Grandpa-so we(Grandpa and I) had to go and get the recipe in our mailbox in Tall Pines...long story...and when I was there I saw my neighbor and his daughters Kalei and Mia.  Kalei was screaming my name and I couldn't make out if it was her or not but I ran down there and she was in this little toy car and she jumped out and ran and hugged me-I was really happy to see her...then I saw Billy, Niki's brother...so me and Kalei ran down there to ask if Niki was home...she was so when it was time to leave Grandpa stopped by so I could say hi...when she opened the door she just stood there and then started screaming and ran out-and even started to cry...and then Jessie-her next door neighbor that I met at Niki's birthday party-had just drove up and we said hey... then sadly it was time to go home so could give the recipe to mom...it is lamb-it is kinda gross...but okay). Mom got mad b/c they said they didn't like it.  And mom tried to arrange something for Jessie and Kalei like to spend the night together...it was a big surprise to Jessie but Kalei knew and just starred at the clock until she got there...aww...then right before Jessie was suppose to leave~Chris and Nicole and the baby, Grandma, Grandpa, and mom were all sitting around chatting...then someone comes up to the door...hmmm??? who could it be...it was KELLY!!!!!!! I really wasn't suppose to see her (another long story) but my mom let her come by...so we hung out and then they were about to leave and mom said to me where is your clothes...and I turned to Kelly and yelled I HATE YOU...but of course I was jsut kidding...so when I left(Kelly you are improving on you driving ::clap::) and arrived at Kelly's dad's house guess who was sitting on the couch...GRANDMA!!!!!!...wow too many surprises but I loved them all!!  Me and Kelly stayed up late talkin to Darrion and Brad-wow they are still as stupid as before...j/k-. Then Kelly's dad woke us up w/ a wonderful breakfast mmmm!! Then we toke a shower and got ready...of course we had to take 'some' pics!!! And afterward we had to go so I could see Kelly's mom and Mario and get some stuff...when we got there they were still sleeping...Kisses remembered me...I don't know where Cookie was...Kelly's mom try to steel me so I wouldn't have to go again...but hey I will be back on Christmas break!!  When I got back to my grandparents Kelly kept missing the house!!! Even when I would yell RIGHT HERE~~no one was there except my grandma cookin...when everbody arrived we ate some good cookin...then we hung out and Chris came by w/ Nicole and the baby-Chris took me out to try and learn stick shift but nope not for me...then mom and Nicole left w/ the baby and Uncle John arrived w/ Justin BIG SURPRISE!!!!So we all hung out and then when every left and the twins came over...grrrr...we left to go to some lady's house...mom talked to them and right before we were gonna leave my dad calls!! He wants to get together...I was kinda hesitant at first but then said sure! and I am glad I did...we had fun and then went by to his parents...I saw them and Clay...Grandma and Grandpa Atwell aren't doing very well physically wise...but when it was time to leave...something was telling me that I should stay...it was weird b/c that is what I wanted to do...I didnt want to go back w/ mom...but I knew I had to...When dad dropped me off mom and dad talked for a long time...then after a while a went to bed. On Friday, mom called me to say our bird died...from it being to cold and the frost from outside got to him b/c he was by a window...I liked the bird a lot...but mom left to go to the cemetery to put in some flowers and then went and got another bird...when she came back we ate Thanksgiving leftovers and had to go~b/c I was suppose to go to a game...but my mom took to long w/ the stupid bird lady grrrrrr...When I was saying good-bye to my grandparents I wanted to cry b/c I don't want to leave them... On the ride back me and my mom got into a fight and would rather not talk about it...so that was pretty much my vacation...I guess the highlights were just seeing everybody again...Well I'm gonna go now-my hands hurt
Love~-~-NIKKI

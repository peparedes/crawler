1st off i wanna say wow am i glad its friday!!!!!
today went to school...boring what else is new?
then got home was really bored soo decided
to go on a walk/part bikeride with nat and
bronte!! then we went to nats and like dropped
her off then brontes and we played a little 
basketball with her little brothers
and sisters (they are soo cute!) ahhh
my phone wouldn`t stop ringing..
bianca called and we decided to go 
to the play with bianca si. and 
NOOR! <- i missed her soo much
love you noor :*) soo yeah
went to the play it was really funn
and actually pretty good! good job
everyone! lmfaooo they all got soo 
embarressed bc i kept cheering for 
little brandino* 
after the play met some girls
lmfaoooo <3 brandon your soo 
freakin funny *pretending* to fall
bumping into the wall when he actually
did it on purpose wow he made it seem 
soo reall couldn`t stop laughing! 
then our fat asses decided to go
to max and ermas too eat ...
so yeah ate there than dropped the 
girlies <3 home *
i was thinking about it
seriously people need to freakin 
have funn in life who cares?!
lifes tooo short! be your self*
dont care what others think either
do the most outragous things ever
give yourself a good character
its more important than ur reputation
oh and another thing i hate when people 
use gods name in vain ( and no i wasnt
doing that right now bc i was preeching it)
seriously even if you do dont lie about it!
just felt like letting it out 
thats what live journals are for right?
oh and someone has been really pissing me 
off lately...rather not say any names*

now <3
drinking chii (boater, i know)
making krissy <3 a new lj bc 
im just tooo nice*
leave me some comments
i love you soo much <3

xoxo~ 

Quote Of The Day-

If you dress nicely, he says you're a snob.
If you dress sexy, he says you're a slut.
If you argue with him, he says you're stubborn.
If you're quiet, he says you're boring.
If you call him, he says you're needy and clingy.
If he calls you, he says you should be grateful.
If you don't love him, he'll try to win you.
If you love him, he'll leave you.
If you don't fuck him, he'll say you don't love him.
If you do, he'll say you're easy.
If you tell him your problems, he'll say you're irritating.
If you don't, he'll say you don't trust him.
If you lecture him, he'll say you're bitchy.
If he lectures you, it's because he ""cares.""
If you break a promise, you can't be trusted.
If he breaks it, he had to.
If you cheat, you expect it to be over
If he cheats, he expects to be given another chance
Either way us girls never win

Quote of the day <3 

we've had our shares of good times 
and then our shares of bad.
but, we stuck by eachother through it all
and i've realized just how much i have.
i have sisters, more like angels -
who are my very best friends.
and i know we'll be together even after this life ends."

Quote Of The Day -<3-
""...nothing in life is promised, except death. If you have the opportunity to play this game of life, you need to appreciate every moment. a lot of people don't appreciat their moment. And then you gotta tell those Al Bunyan stores, 'You remember when I...' Right now is my time and my moment...Everybody wanted to know what I'd do if I didn't win. I guess we'll never know."" - Kanye West

"event","call me crazy,
but i just scalded my skin in hot water...
am i crazy?
yes i feel like it.
i'm desperate.
desperate for a break.
desperate for a piece of heaven.
why do all the good things go away?
...
je ne sais pas.
i just lost my job...
well the only student i have...
because of school.
yes i KNOW  school is important
but that job made me feel...
independant you know? 
...
je ne sais pas.
i feel so anti-social
(harhar hope)
i hate talking with the kids at school.
i feel like bashing their faces...
...
i made a fool out of myself 
and i hate myself for it.
i should stop writing in here.
before i burn something.
i wish i never met some people
i wish i never had my hopes so high
<b>Everything</b> is an illusion...
i'm sorry mom and dad...
i hate disappointing you..."

"event","i used to think that
people will pop in front of you
and juss be friends with you.
because that's what it felt like...
making friends. 
i used to think that
the ""perfect guy"" will pop in front of you
and stay with you
because that's what happened...
in a literal sense.

but now when i think about it
it doesn't happen that way.
you have to have some kind of..
process in order to do this.
gah. i feel so stupid sometimes.
but that's how you learn right?
but when you fall
and during the process of getting up
it's EMBARASSING and i hate feeling
embarassed...
makes me like i've degraded myself you know? 

grr. gotta get rid of this pride issue.
it's a huge burden...
but i mean, that's how i lived you know?
i didn't have the money, the looks, the body,
the smarts, the materialistic shit, the personality...
but i had my pride. 
it wasn't a lot, but damn, 
i had lots of things to be proud OF.
at least...in toronto.
but here? i'm like ... a tiny little dot
in the middle of everywhere. 

now i can get sentimental
and write down the things i MISS,
but screw that idea. 
But all I can say is...
I trusted you."

"event","<center>What a strange way to meet
On VancouverExchange
He seemed to be sweet,
Then I felt the change.
I really didn't realize that
I fell for his goodness,
His voice, and the funny way that he sat.
Friends were shocked by this suddeness
And told me to stop, drop & run
But I couldn't, wouldn't, and I didn't.
The weeks felt like the sun,
I was out of my confinement,
But it all crashed down on me when I told.
I couldn't believe my stupid self,
Should've realized the guy was SOLD.
Friends told me to pity myself
By laughing and beckoning me with cheap wine.
But I gotta give him 'props',
For opening my eyes.
It felt like everything was  tops,
But eventually everything all dies.
I'll miss the inside jokes,
Even though I never got to know him well.
I'll always remember the way he spoke
And the advice he used to tell.
I hope life goes well for him
For he sure deserves it
I know his smile will never go dim,
Even for a little bit.
I actually cried,
Realizing that I lost a sunshine.
I swallowed my pride,
And wrote this piece,
Just for some temporary peace."

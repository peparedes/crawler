"event","I feel sorry for my human. She hasn't been sleeping much. She either feeds us too early or tpp late... it worries me. Last night the people where organizing stuff late into the night. They then woke up early again. Janine didn't feed me untill 10. At least I got fed. Because there this one fish that wont leave me alone and I swear I'm going to kill him."

"event","So today I didn't do much.  Bo got an LJ and I was quite envious. So I made Janine get me one. HA! She is so under my control! She fed me late today. Damn her! Oh well... Fattie didn't share the flakes again. I wasn't really hungry anyway. I haven't ate well since Carlene died. I loved her. I don't think Janine knew that. Hmm... now she does, because she types this for me!!! MUHAHAHAHAHA!!! Ah, silly human."

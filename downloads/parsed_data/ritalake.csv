"event","The word that Chloe's generation uses to describe a high percentage of experience.
Awkward.
That's how I feel. Taught Peyton till 6. Todd and I tag-team. He taught him at 6. I knew the evening
was going to be What a Wonderful Life--Chloe's choice, of course. 
I proceeded to make dinner. We haven't really had many dinners just the 3 of us during Chloe's break.
Seemed like the night.
Then Dylan shows up, like at 6:30, in the midst of cooking frenzy, in the midst of Todd getting Peyton's letters of rec together, in the midst of Chloe interjecting involvement, as the hormones dictate.
That was then.
Now it's 8:09 and I'm hungry.
Todd seems nervous, in the state where he talks about himself, and when Dylan starts sharing something of what he's doing at school or in life, Todd cuts him off with a change of subject...or a ""let's put a log in the fire."""""

"event","It was 7:30AM when we arrived in Amsterdam. Customs was an easy pass-through, and we soon found a train to Central Station. From there we walked over cobblestones a few blocks and along the Singel Canal to Hotel Brouwer. It was before ckeck-in time but the woman at the desk allowed us to stash our bags in the office for the time being.

In our jet-lag stupor we headed out on foot. Found a cafe nearby and ordered coffee, tea and OJ, and watched people in boots, on bikes, heading to work. Many many bikes, whirring by very fast,  but settled-seeming, without any sense of chaos. Some people rode one-handed with a cell phone in the other; no helmets, all wore regular street clothes, nice winter coats, even high heels, very unlike the plastic, bright-colored, gear-laden outfits of American cyclists.  Amsterdam this morning was grey, mild, and had a nice light mist From here we could take in the rows of tall, skinny buildings, each unique and endlessly charming.

We continued on foot, taking in the sights. At every turn there was another beckoning side street, many very narrow and curved. As it approached noon we stopped into Sara's Pancake House. I had a Greek salad, Chloe ordered a waffle with chocolate and ""whip,"" and Todd had a waffle topped with a mass of hot cherries. Sara herself was friendly and down-to-earth, and gave us some maps with highlights circled. She also told us about the ""Cannibus Cup,"" a reknowned taste-test competition, which happened to be going on now, attended by people from around the world, herbal experts, and hosted by a group of local coffeeshops. ""Coffeeshop"" in Amsterdam equals marijuana cafe.

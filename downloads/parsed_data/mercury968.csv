"event","So, my recital was last night.  Well, the first 10 minutes.  For those of you who weren't in Columbus last night, here's the story.  I'm backstage after playing the Mozart with Catherine, tuning my bass from orchestral to solo.  All of a sudden, there is a loud anouncement saying that everyone must go to the basement of the River Center because of tornados that have touched down in Alabama.  So, there are all these people waiting around until 8:30.  Once they let us go, most people left, so those of us still in the school ate the food at my reception.  How awesome is that?  Recital '07!!!  I felt bad because my parents and Reanna drove down from Clay Co to see it.  PLUS, Dr. Rumbelow was there, so he was stuck down there with everyone when I'm sure his wife was wondering if he was OK.  This will make for great stories in the next week.

"event","Yeah yeah, it's been a while.  I know.  What do you expect?  The semester is over, and all is well.  No more jazz band for me!  Woot!  I actually got around to taping my piano proficiency, and now that is out of the way.  One more semester to go and I'll be done at CSU.  Full recital, here I come!  I'm hoping I can get the date I want.  April 11 (it's a Wed.).  Now, I know what most of you Columbus people must be thinking...""Oh no!  Kelly's graduating!  What are we going to do for a bass studio?""  Fear not friends.  I'll be in Columbus for the following year working like a whore and getting applications out for grad school.  I'm hoping the school will pay me to play for them 'cause that would give me some nice pocket money to pay for that car I plan on getting in a few months.  Yes, it's actually going to happen.  Can you believe it?  I can't.
Congrats to all who graduated this past week!  You all deserve it, and I know you all will do well in life.
So, I'm home until January 6th or 7th.  My poor little bass is going to the shop this week, but I hope to have it back by Saturday at the latest.  I've been at the house with my dad, playing Final Fantasy X.  I'm sooooooooo kicking its ass right now.  I think I'm going to get FF XII and the new version of FF VII when I'm done (I'm hoping the remake FF VIII because that one was my favorite).  I've also considered getting those guitar games for PS2.  Me, Catherine, and Jason have played it at Game Stop...it's really not that bad.  Even a little fun.  Judge if you must, but once you try it, you'll change your mind.  
If anyone wants something fun to do and is in the Clay. Co./ATL area, let me know.  Something may happen.  Bwah-ah-ah!
Guess I'll get back to getting Lulu some more spells.  It will make life alot easier.

"event","I know, it's been forever...my badd (yeah, 2 d's like Color Me Badd).  I just thought I'd let those out there know I'm alive and taking advantage of what may be my last summer in Columbus (drinking, swimming, chillin', karaoke, and oh so much more...doesn't sound much different from the school year, but whatever, it's what I do).  Little Williams is in town this week observing the children...I don't think he's touched one yet, I'm proud to say.  J/k Jason...maybe.  Looooooooooooooooove yooooooooooooooooou!  
Now to what made me want to post today.  I though I'd do a countdown of those things that are near and dear to my heart.
1) Transformers movie: 355 days (July 4, 2007)...I found out last week that this was happening, AND you can see previews on IMDB!!!  Hey Reanna, do you think that after all these years mashed potatoes can still be your friends?  DARE TO BE STUPID!!!
2) Harry Potter and the *insert book title that a few people know, and I'm not one of them*: 358 days (July 7, 2007...yes, 7/7/07)...This is the date that is set for now, but we know how these things change.  Lets hope it doesn't.
3) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: ONE YEAR FROM TODAY! Yeah, I went there...JEALOUS?! I can only imagine how dark this movie will be.  It's going to be HAWT! (And if you haven't heard, M. Night Shyamalan is rumored to be talking to people so he can direct the 6th and MAYBE 7th movies.  Yeah, I know!  They asked him to do the first, but he was doing 'Unbreakable' ~I don't know how to do italics, and I'm too lazy to figure it out~ at the time and now wishes he would have done it.  Aw, sad times).
Others will be added to this list, so stay tuned.

"event","So, yeah.  Here I am once again.  Today's post comes from the library at the Schwob School of Music and is brought to you by the letters T, G, N, and by the number 3.  I'm waiting for convo, as usual.  Yay for no Friday master class.  Brian is in town until tomorrow, and he's at the bassoon master class right now.  I think he's going to reed class to, so I'll have to find something to do after convo, too.  
Richard and I both passed convo!!!  Woot!!!  You know, we didn't think we'd make it, but in the end we worked hard and pulled it off.  Hopefully next semester won't be so killer...seeing how it's our last one and all.
My jury is Monday at 11:40 am.  So, I get to go to Geology, get a snack, do my jury, and then go to Music History.  Yippie skippie.
Happy Chaunukah to all.  Until next time..."

"event","Yeah yeah, I know.  It's been for fucking ever since my last post.  Alot of shit has happened in the past whenever.  I had a paper for Music History (8 pages on the Mozart Bassoon Concerto), I went to the Atlanta Opera to see ""Don Giovani"", I had a LaGrange gig (yay for paying gigs), there were some issues between me and Brian (but everything is kewl now), and class in general just gets in the way.  There is an Orchestra concert tonight (2 string quartet pieces and then Brahms Symphony 1).  Friday starts the annual Conductor's Workshop weekend here at CSU (luckily I don't have to do any of the workshops this year).  I'm also working on the music for my recital next semester.  That's all that I have on my plate...""'That's all' she says"" (Dolly Parton in Steel Magnolias).  
So, last night we had a rehearsal in Legacy for the Orchestra concert.  During Adam and Amanda's joint recital, they were pushing the piano back stage and got it stuck in the door way.  Can you fucking believe that.  One of the people pushing the damn thing is a piano teacher.  I swear.  They were pushing it backwards and when it wouldn't fit through, they decided they would just try to shove it.  Dumbasses.  
I am so GD tired, and no matter how much I sleep, I never feel like it's enough.  This semester is just dragging.  I wish it would end.  Maybe it's that damn 9 am Geology class that I have.  Who knows.  
I fucking hate bras.  This one I'm wearing is so damn uncomfortable.  
Georgia got their asses spanked by Auburn on Saturday...hehehe.
I guess that's all I have to report.  I'm going to check out a pair of headphones so I can listen to some Homestar Runner.  Until next time..."

Especially for those who don't have anything to do with it and are getting in way over their head with this crap.  I'd rather read LJ entries about partying or random road trips or something that doesn't involve name calling or hateful-awful things like that.  Wouldn't everyone else?  I'm sure you would, so let's do that...
This is my last week of not playing in Wind Ensemble.  Their concert is Thursday evening (as usual).  Also, because I'm not in this rotation, I don't have to go to the recording session on Friday.  I always get so nervous in those things.  Whether it be my stool moving or hitting my instrument with my bow...it sucks.  Rumbelow laughs and moves on.  It's cute.  Isn't is Stephanie???  ::thinks on Chang dance::
My dad is home now.  He's having to see a cardiologist sometime soon, and they also found that he is diabetic.  When I go home for Thanksgiving break, I have to go get tested for it and I guess whatever else they can find that's wrong with me.
I'm thinking of minoring in math.  I'm going to look into it at some point toward the end of the semester.  We'll see how that is.
So, that's all I'm posing for now.  Can we please move past all of this and drink this weekend or go do something fun like bowling or skating or baking...ANYTHING!?!?!?  PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE?!?!?!  Until next time..."

I know I know, it's been forever since I've updated.  My badd...2 d's.  I'm home for fall break now.  I got back to Clay. Co. yesterday (Chris brought me by).  It's weird being home.  I miss doing whatever the fuck I want whenever I want, and having the option of doing it naked.  All I've really done is watch TV and listen to Brahms 1 while I read my part.  We're supposed to know the 4th movement by Wednesday.  I'm going to try and go back to C-town on Monday so I can actually play through the part on my bass.  I miss him so.  
Wow, they've changed Live Journal since the last time I made an entry.  Interesting.
My mom took my dad to the hospital a little while ago because he thinks that he might have had a mild stroke.  I'm like...ok.  I don't know how I'm really supposed to take it, ya know?  
Ok, I could have sworn that I just felt my house shake.  I don't know if it was the surround sound from the TV or if it was something outside.  If I wasn't so lazy I'd go out there to see if anything happened.

She said he had colon cancer.  It is extremely rare to have it that young, or so I was told.  His birthday is October 15.  I still remember that after all these years(so many people from school shared that birthday).  He was one of my closest friends growing up.  I new him in 3rd grade when his mom came to our class and taught us dances to Michael Jackson's music.  Then we both went to the same middle school and joined orchestra.  We worked together to learn the bass.  Me, Cherokee, Reanna, and Jarred.  The 'Killer Bs' as we were known.  The best bass section ever.  He left Morrow High, but I still saw him at football games and other events.  He was one of the first people to call me Kelly-Bob.  One of the ones who brought it from East Clayton Elementary to Adamson Middle, then to Morrow High.  He was a great person with a fabulous soul and he will be missed.  We love you Cherokee.

So, I lay in bed for about 30 minutes, then I decide to get up to see if that helps.  It doesn't.  Then I try drinking some water, which made me feel worse.  It actually made breathing harder.  So, I call Terrance and he takes me to the ""Doctor's Hospital"" on Veterans.  They give me a check-up with blood work and x-rays, the whole she-bang.  They tell me that I have acid reflux (and I see that I still have extremely high blood pressure).  So I get a prescription for some medicine to help with it.  It was THE worst pain.  I hope I never have to feel that again.  Thanks to my friends who make me feel better.  :-D  Terrnace, thanks for the ride...I owe you one.

Me and Sherrod and Eddie spent the day at Dr. Jacobs' house.  Her and Ann and David went out of town, and Eddie is house sitting.  They have four black cats that are so cute.  We watched tv and ate lunch and played 'Monopoly'.  I hate that game...usually, but this time I SOOOOO kicked their asses.  It was the first time I finished the game, and the first time I won.  Woot for me.  Today was productive.  I did my dishes, moved my bedroom furniture around, did my homework, and watched the season finale of 'Queer As Folk'.  It was kind of a let down.  Now I'm home, updating my journal. 
So, here's my ghetto plans for going to the John Mayer concert next month, if I can.  There's a shuttle that runs from Columbus to the airport in Atlanta.

I, however, have taken away the right to call it everyone else's country but mine because I've seen too many STUPID ASS PEOPLE on my tv today:  
FIRST, people are trying to say that Bill Cosby doesn't know what he's talking about and that he's wrong.  NOT!!!  Bill Cosby is my hero.  He has been since I watched the Cosby show as a child (and I still watch the reruns).  Dr. Cosby (yes, he's a doctor now) is only speaking the truth.  I know exactly what he's talking about because I GREW UP WITH THOSE KIDS!!!  They make up my whole county.  I love them, I really do.  Besides, it's not just black kids (at least where I live) that can fit into this category that he's talking about.  And don't try to say that it's just a thing of the 'white man trying to keep the black man down'.  Yes, we all joke about it (at least I do), but it's far from the truth.  And don't try to say that all white people are racist and that's the root of it all.  There ARE racists out there, but they're everywhere on earth.  I've even had people be racist toward me...TWICE!!! (yes, it can happen)  Dr. Cosby, keep on saying what you're saying.  You're one of the few in this country that knows what they're talking about.
SECOND, John Kerry is saying that if he's president, he will create a law that gives amnesty to those illegal immigrants who sneak past the system for five years and will give them citizenship in America.  Am I the only one who sees something wrong with that?  If you come to this country from another, and you work hard and do everything the right and legal way, then yes, you may be a citizen.  If you sneak around for five years and you don't get caught, you should not be allowed to jump in front of the line like a fat kid at lunch.  It doesn't work like that...trust me, I know.  
THIRD, I'm not going to touch Michael Moore's movie.  I don't even like speaking it's name.  I have not seen it, and I am not going to pay money to see it.  Maybe when it comes on PBS or GPTV.  Who knows, maybe I'll be having a good day and give it a chance and watch it on HBO.  THEN, I will give my opinion on it.  However, I will say that someone who does not vote or does not plan to vote has no right to say anything about the country or those who run it.  If you don't like the way it's run, then leave.  I won't miss you.

John Mayer and Maroon 5 will be in Atlanta on August 29.  The concert is at the HiFi Buys Amphlitheatre.  It's a Sunday, and yes, class would be on Monday (although I'm all for skipping).  Hopefully, if I'm working at the music library, I can get that day off.  If you wanna go, let's talk.  You could meet my future husband.  I'm sure John wouldn't mind.  J/K...maybe.
My parents are cleaning out the attic and they have all this crap everywhere.  I have THE cutest glasses from back in the day.  They also have all these newspaper clippings.  It just so happens that they have the whole paper from 'The Washington Post' that is the day Reagan was sworn into office and the American hostages in Iran were set free.  It's pretty neat.
BUSH '04!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Until next time..."

"event","So, Jennifer had her baby yesterday.  Victor the 3rd was born on June 04, 2004 at 6:30 p.m.  She's a mommy.  Aw.  I wish I could see them, but I don't have a way to the hospital.  Damn pedestrian ways.
Today is a sad day.  President Reagan died today.  He was 93.  He was, by far, one of THE best presidents we've had.  He accomplished soooooooooo much while he was in office.  He will be missed.
I just finished looking at pointe shoes on eBay.  I found some that I like, it just depends on when I feel like bidding.  I *heart* eBay.com.
I have this really weird feeling right now.  I don't know what it is, but I don't like it.  Not at all.
Until next time..."

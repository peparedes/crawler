"event","its bonfire night. but i aint doing anything.havent bin invited anywhere anyway. its cold and shit and im ill.
feel like death warmed up.

sooo jay couldnt see me on tuesday, it turned out, so hes seeing me tomorrow.
hes got some shopping to do apparently. dont know where i really fit into the equation anymore to be honest, hes already told me outright that he wants to focus on his job right now. and that hes not gonna lie to me and say he will see me more... so what do i do..im clinging on to a life that used to resemble my own..but its not anymore.


went to becks' last night. she ended up wanting to go out. so yeah we went out. sat with some men with no teeth, and ended up talking to joe cutting again, aka the biggest sleaze in GY.
the lines he comes out with crack me up. cuz i would never ever do anything with him 1 coz hes ugly 2 coz he fucked shell over [she ''didnt have tha skills to pay tha bills'' apparently] and 3 its him and hes a wierdo

but i do find him entertaining when hes pissed.
do u like diamonds ?  yeah why ?  well you should suck my cock its a jem. pffffffft. kept trying to get me to go home with him. it will never ever happen. im not cheap.

saw tammis ex aswell. apparently he wanted to get into me but he got into her instead. cuz i got with someone else. they all come crawling back in the end....so i have noticed...everyone who has ever rejected/dumped me/gone off me/couldn't be with me...has all come back in one way or another..[and its wierd]

went home and could not get undressed so i sat in my clothes until half 2 this morning.

might be off to newcastle at some point next week. get away from the drama and stuff. clear my head. yeahhh.

been dosing myself up on flu medication. keep sneezing at everyone. feeel soooooooooooooooo ill. hot bath. beechams. nytol. goodnight."

if i wasn't in a shit mood i would laugh.

been sleeping since i got in this morning. un-natural of course.
but what that fuck was i suposed to do.

and yeah, people and their shit games. omg, cannot be doing with it, i've had it all before, and i know what ur doing. its childish. i can see through it. so be straight up with me. fucking makes me sick. nobody can confront me, so i must have summat over em. right ?

gonna go see becks again tonight.shes been stood up.
so it aint just me who gets fucked over..

makes me laugh how the people who are so judgemental over me [not that they've come out with it, i can just read them like a book], and what im doing, have done things that are so so so much worse. so before people jump to conclusions about how i choose to live my life, sit back and look at your own sorry state of affairs. its shocking. really is."

"event","ok, so i had a good night, ate loads, drank a skinfull. all is well.

but i feel like i've failed.
failed my boyfriend.
i cant imagine being with no-one else.
yet hes so unhappy.

if i trusted myself enough to do it well, i would honestly attempt to end things right now. not with him. with me. end me.

he deserves so much more than me.
i've ruined everything for him.
i have tried to love him and it just isnt working. its still not enough.



i hate myself.
fucking wish these sleeping pills would go faster. probably shouldnt be having them considering what i've drunk tonight but oh well.


i dont deserve to be happy or fullfilled.
that boy is a diamond.
and im just me. i dont deserve no-one to love me. everything i touch turns to shit. im so confused. wish i could focus on making it work with the love of my life. but i cant. and i dont trust myself to be on my own.

"event","had the worst argument in the world with jay last night

apparently everythings my fault
i dont make any effort
the blame is on me
hes sick of me getting my tits out on photo shoots
hes sick of sharing me with the world.
hes sick of me having sexy display pictures on my msn [ yet, he knows that the only people who aint blocked on msn are him, lolly, bex and some photographers] and when i do unblock other people i change my pics
he didnt speak to me on halloween because i was ''out being a slag''
he doesnt have time for anthing

but yeah, he blames me for things. i cant beleive he used msn to have an argument with me. i cant beleive how low i feel. hes got it into my head that this is my fault.

i could not stop crying the other night. becks was texting me telling me not to be sad, and shes cooking for me tonight. but nobody fucking understands how i feel. i was just lashing out at everyone. i've been a complete bitch today, snapping, swearing, telling people how i feel.

jay text me asking if he cud see me tomorrow, i said i was still very much upset by last night, he replied saying ''maybe he was out of order''

im busy in the morning having a driving lesson and going to the job centre. so im gonna see him when i want. hes got the day off. so yeah.i dont know what to do. we made each other feel shit last night, fisrt time we've spoke in over a week, and thats just so he can use me as an emotional punchbag.

but i said maybe later on, and added that im not in the mood for anymore drama.
had to fucking sedate myself last night, was crying so hard i couldnt breath, so had 5 sleeping pills and just wanted to sleep so that it wouldnt hurt anymore. so he couldnt hurt me. so we couldnt hurt each other.

apparently he falls asleep on purpose because i ''only want him for sex''. so hes implying im a nymphomaniac sex addict. that hurts. hell of a lot. beleive me i know the value of sex. i have a lot of friends who are virgins. and i respect them so fucking much, and i dont beleive in just fucking him cuz hes there. i cant beleive he said that.

im also selfish, and ignorant, and i never listen. thats why he dont tell me how he feels.

so i said why are u with someone who makes u feel like that, and he said, DONT YOU DARE TRY AND GET ME TO BREAK UP WITH YOU, I KNOW WHAT YOUR TRYING TO DO AND IT WONT WORK.
how evil does he think i am ? do other people see me in this way ? he makes me feel like im a complete bastard...am i ?  am i really bad ??  cuz i never thought i was, all i've ever done is love him, fell in love with his personality before his looks, hes so fucking smart, and he makes me laugh, and all that other shit, and he looks like a diamond too... then theres me. plain. ugly boring little me.
who is apparently a complete bitch. maybe i dont deserve him ..maybe maybe maybe.


i dont wanna hurt anymore. he doesnt know how upset i've been. i hurt so bad. and im sick of crying my eyes out night after night.


got woke up by the cat jumping on me.
todays been shit.
just applying for jobs i know i wont get.

sick and tired of being sick and tired."

jay text me some shit about having an ice moustache. it was not what i wanted to hear.

"event","today. like you know when you feel like you've done something really wrong but you dunno what. well, i do know. but its not wrong. its right.

feel wierdly alone and depressed. this started just after about 1am last night, could not get my mind off this shit that keeps eating me up. im so dissapointed in myself.

i'm tired of hating myself
i'm sick of being weak
i'm sick of having no self control or restraint
i hate not being able to put things to the back of my mind

didnt get drunk last night. im a different person when im drunk. 
when i've had a drink...its very difficult for me to stop. and after my binges on monday and tuesday i didnt trust myself again. it would have been so easy though, to get drunk, and just forget everything thats fucking me over.

somthing that really pissed me off,about 4 people asking me where jay was, how come i wasn't out with him etc etc etc

like Lynn said today, im not his fucking keeper.
i dont know where he is, what he is doing, when he is free. he doesnt let me know his plans, so i cant see him. its as simple as that.

mum was being unhelpfull as normal. when i told her he was meant to see me this week, but now it will maybe be one day next week, she said, ''oh so has he just been working then?''. i said ''mum, nobody works 24 hours a day, 7 days a fucking week''. hes a man not a machine. god, i wish my parents would stick up for me for a change, why am i always the bad person.

saw billy last night, and i was like, do you know where my boyfriend is, cuz i dont, and he didnt know, and he just told me to sort it out, and that it was fucked up. how can i sort it out ? i dont see him for long enough to talk about anything important, i cant even breach the subject with him, because the whole thing makes me uneasy.

saw barrett, and he was like, wheres jay, wheres jay, and i was like your guess is as good as mine, he was like, oh, are you not together anymore, no we are together, i just dont see him. walked off after that cuz i could have quite easily burst into tears.


aside from this i had a brilliant brilliant night, dressed up as a nurse, complete with nurse stockings.
danced a lot. paying for that today. my feet are killing me softly.

it was alllll kicking off
there was some man dressed as bin laden on the dancefloor in new lloyds, so fucking funny, he had one of them emo tea towel scarfs on his head, and a robe, and this big plastic pistol that he was waving in the air, so the bouncer took it off him upstairs, things were not quite so jolly, a fight broke out between some man dressed as tony the tiger and someone else...a ginger man dressed as a slutty fairy got caught in the cross fire, and ended up getting  floored and looked like he was dead..i hope he isnt
went to the couch house near the station, there was a band on, and some fat slutty women were pulling each others hair and fightingggggggggg. dont like violence :( :( 

couldnt sleep again, cried a bit and eventually went to sleep shivering.

bought romeo and juliet on dvd today. i dont get any of it. does that make me thick, as well as morbid and depressed ???

i think so.

got a driving lesson on tuesday. what is the point ? none.
menna be seeing jay tuesday. so that mean i wont be able to go out pfffffffft. for fucks sake. this is if he dont cancel...i cant remember what he said exactly but i deleted the text cuz it annoyed me. i dont know what to say to him, i dont know how to act, i cant be doing with having one perfect day, where it feels like he loves me, for it to get taken away again, until god knows when. i dont want to lose him. but i have lost him. hes already gone.

hes sucessful. hes got a good job. he can drive. hes got a nice house. he does normal family stuff. hes attractive. hes going places.

then theres me.

i'm thick as shit. i fail at everything i attempt. i've lost every job i ever had. i cant drive.my house is falling to pieces. im physcically deformed, got a shit body. i've got a wierd disjointed family. and im not going anywhere. because im on the dole. and i've got no money.


i should just hurry up and throw myself off a bridge, cuz its only a matter of time before someone pushes me off the fucking thing anyway."

"event","took my mind off a few things, knew i shouldnt be spending a lot of money
cuz i dont have a job and such, but yeah.made me feel a bit better. got a few bits and pieces, for myself and other people.

went out for a drink with dean last night, hes alright, but i really couldnt be arsed as it was a wednesday
it was freezing cold
i dont know him
i had no money
and i just couldnt be bothered to socialise
went home at like half 10 anyway so its hardly like i was out all night.


looking forward to an early night with a cup of tea and a donut today
jay text me today. nothing interesting. but yeah, he text me. i cut the conversation short cuz i hardly had any credit but i didnt want him to think i was being ignorant. i wish he'd make more effort with me, i wish he would.
i dont feel worthy of him. he never tells me he loves me. he cant spare a couple of hours a week for me.i dont feel like im good enough for him. we are polar opposites. people i dont even know spend more time with me, and i think thats good, because despite what people say, like i shouldnt have to be on my own, and miserable all the time. just because i have a boyfriend, doesnt mean i have to stay locked in the house, dressed like a woman twice my age, with no friends. i feel like hes gone away from me, if he broke up with me i wouldnt be suprised, i'd kind of expect it. but i would be upset. despite people thinking im a heartless little bitch. im not a bad person - thats the one thing i need reassurance on..that im a good person...


oh fuck offf fuck off.
i do my head in. i havent thought about anything in particular all day, and its been great, but i come home and start thinking about all this crap that shouldnt be affecting me. might just have a bath, take some tablets and go to sleep. cuz i cant be arsed with upsetting myself. beating myself up mentally. i'd get drunk again, but im wary of it... want someone to ring me badly..just so i can not be on my own.

halloween tomorrow. my favourite day of the year.
hope its good. really do. gonna walk to asda or lidl in the morning to get a pumpkin. 
dunno what im doing for halloween. wanna go out.

shut up you fucking stupid bitch.
eat your donut.
drink your tea
and get the fuck out of my face.


i am happy. i am content. i am worthy. 


if i had never stopped chanting, none of this would of happend, and i would be great. and i beleive that.







you ever fill your whole day up with shit to occupy yourself,and your mind, then, when you are on your own, you sit back, and focus for a moment, and realise that you feel completely empty, and you just dont know who you are, or what you want to do??????? 

thats how i feel.
most people would talk to their other half about this kinda stuff, in the vain hope they would understand and make ya feel better. but i cant do that cuz i'll just get ''well, your not right in tha head, you need to see a doctor''. i dont want to see a doctor. i dont wanna talk to someone who doesnt give a fuck about me, or know me, or understand me. i want him to understand me, he wont be thinking about me now, i am thinking of him. i just need to let go. he wants me to end it, i can tell, he doesnt wanna do it cuz he doesnt wanna be responsible for what i might do.

we was suposed to be doing something one night this week, like watching a movie at his or whatever one night, but he hasnt arranged anything, and its friday tomorrow, and the weeks almost through. just feel like he aint bothered whether he sees me or not, oh well. 

theres other people who'd want me isn't there ??
no.
no there is not. not for you. because i dont deserve it.


i want to drink but i dont trust myself. fuck off."

everytime i do something with someone and get fucked over
its a complete blow to my confidence even more. it is my own fault. and i do fuck myself over a lot. but yeah.. 

want someone to be here for me. not just when they feel like it, but when i feel like it. i am shivering so much now, and thats cuz i've had a drink...
stupid fucking cow arn't you ????

he clearly thinks im stupid
i know hes trying to make me jealous...another one with a little 16 year old ugly girlfriend when hes 20
whenever he has a girlfriend he trys to make it this big fuck  you to me.

burlesque night was good. bought a new outfit for it. i liked it. had a shoot in hull with to die 4 vintage and that was fun, if slightly crazy as well. got new shoes and a skirt.

sunday. had sunday dinner. saw becks. went to get cash out and these freaky, chavvy little children kept following us, sounds lame but i was bricking it, thinking oh not again, cant be doing with getting attacked for my bag again, so i went and stood in tha chinese for ages, and ordered some food i didnt even want. the woman in there thought i was a right physcopath.. 
got back to becks and was shaking but i just made out i was cold.
felt dead pathetic..just thought to myself fucking grow up

i hate this town. i hate having to be wary of stuff all the time. i hate how rough it is at night. never used to feel like this, never used to be on edge all the time. whenever i walk to town now, im constantly looking all around me and convinced someone is following me. but i felt safer walking round manchester at night. so much better.

had a shoot today with pirate photography and lolly, it was loads of fun, and the pictures so far are looking good. still hate my scar though !!
cant wait to see some more.
got nothing to do tomorrow. mums off to birmingham for a night out


want someone to keep me company in tha day... 
want someone to snuggle me in bed.
its been ages since anyone slept in tha same bed as me...sad really haha.
dunno  when im seeing jay again, was meant to be getting ice cream and films one day this week but i havent got a day yet.

need to sleep.
need a cuddle.
need a longggggggggg conversation. and some more drink.


wish i could talk to someone, someone who wont judge me, cuz its suposed to feel wrong but it doesnt, it feels right then i get bored of it feeling like that, and then i think.  i always think after. why is life so complicated.
do i love him cuz i miss him, or do i miss him cuz i love him ? or is it cuz i dont see him. wanted him here tha past few days.
but i've just been getting buy on the occasional morning text. its just chit chat. keeping things smooth.

it is wrong what im doing, saying, feeling.
but it feels right, and i dont care that im selling myself short yet again, 
i can remember when i used to get a buzz off feeling nervous, biggest adrenaline rush ever.
i need to have that rush from someone again.


im talking shit. im off to bed."

waiting for jay today
waiting for him to come round
waiting for tha right time to tell him how im feeling, if that time ever comes
waiting to have this nice day he has planned for us.
waiting for something to go wrong again....

woke up early but layed in bed texting. the trees were blowing outside. and i felt dead warm and safe and secure like nothing could hurt me. but thats a lie. cuz i hurt myself. i mentally torture myself everyday.

fell asleep crying my eyes out again. cuz i miss jay. and i miss the attention. and i dont want to tell him how i feel but im going to have to.
that i feel im putting too much pressure on him to see me
that i dont think he has tha time for a girlfriend at the minute
that i want us to spend time together on his days/nights off...when he ever gets them
that i wanna spend my birthday with him
that i care about him and love him more than anyone, but its breaking my heart not seeing him

in my head this will all work out for tha best.
in reality, things are always different. we shall see.


tammi comes home on friday.  so me and becks wanna catch up with her, just go out for a couple of glasses of wine. etc etc. not a big night out..but she text me saying she wants to go to the cinemea...just dont think its tha best place for a catch up but hey ho.
thats why i hate dates at the cinema.  only been on one proper one. but i missed half the movie, and i couldnt talk and that...so it felt a bit pointless.

im the worst girl to date. theres so much stuff i wont do unless i feel comfortable with that person
eating
letting them in my house
cinema
cant sleep in the same bed, and fall asleep if im uncomfortable with somebody
its just wierd. i cant sleep.

texting becks, and jay texted me, saying hes got tomorrow off, and if its sunny hes got a suprise for me. i feel like such a bitch that i have someone so special and i cant even see it. its not his fault. im just unhappy in my self. but we need to talk. so i really hope i get chance to...just to say how im feeling and stuff..try get it all out in the open and come to some sort of agreement..i love him so much, and hes so special to me. its just that tha love has changed, and its different to how it used to be.

theres something seriously wrong with my mother. she just doesnt care about anyoe right now. she snaps at everything, and the only thing that she gets enthusiastic about is weed [obviously] and eating and the weakest link every day . i cant even have a conversation with her now, i feel too uncomfortable.

thursday tomorrow. i wonder what this suprise is. me being me, im guessing summat to do with going to a beach somewhere. he knows i like being outside. but who knows. 

cant beleive how ugly i look today. i hate my clothes, and i hate how i do my make up. if i dont wear eyeliner, i look like a pig, and really wierd. and my pathetic thin little arms. ive just realised how stupid they look. and my fucking huge scar, and my saggy tits, and thin people shouldnt have cellulite and stetch marks, but i do, and that looks rank as well, got cuts and bruises all over me. god. i do not want to sleep with anyone ever again. it would be too embarassing for the both of us, i must be so dissapointing to people, yeh i might look ''alright'' in clothes, but strip me off, and put me under a harsh light and its a different fucking story.
even FUCKING KERRY KATONA  whos had liposuction [ and your menna get scars from that] looks better than me. saw her with her kit off in some magazine...so people would rather sleep with her, and shes 28, and got like 4 kids, than me. and shes older and prettier, and has a perfect body coz she can afford one. bitter.


if there is a god, make me beautiful."

"event","so todays been pretty shit to be honest.had a driving lesson this morning, got most my agression out driving fast.
but thats another waste of 20 quid...
then went to the job centre. it was fucking empty , but yeah, who gives a shit about that.

didn't plan anything today, cuz i intended to see jay. cuz he told me in a text he had the afternoon off to go to the doctors with his allergies. but got a text saying he doesnt really have time to see me. that hurt. and he wasnt sure about next week either !!!!!but i think i made him, cuz i said i'd prefer to talk in person, and he said he'd make time. like hes doing me the biggest favour in the world. he does not seem bothered at all. but i wouldnt be bothered about me either. im ugly, im skinny, im unreasonable, im boring..i look like shit half the time, and yeah !

<b>oh well. he came round for literally 5 minutes,he gave me a hug and he seemed pleased to see me. i was having my tea so he went upstairs, he came downstairs a few minutes later saying he had to leave to go back to work, and he left..well my mum knows how to make things ten times worse,she looks at me, seeing that im about to cry, and says ''its not his fault he has to go back to work''...thanks for that, i know its not his fucking fault, but its not my fucking fault either, so how dare you even comment on something you know nothing about, and you keep failing, time and time again to understand. didnt bother to ask how i am. doesnt ever bother to comfort me , your one and only daughter, just takes his side time and time again like hes the son she never fucking had. my mums lack of emotion all the time is unbeleivable. its like shes still taking prozac or something.

i was crying because i didnt get a chance to talk to him. but hes taking thursday off..maybe...if he can. and im sit here. literally crying my eyes out with about half an hour to get ready to go out. why couldnt he have said he had to go back to work ?  why get my hopes up that im gonna see him ?  thats really not nice.</b>

this is amplified by it being that time of the month. im like a fucking schitzo...[dunno how u spell it] when im on. this morning i walked into my mums room,and started swearing, for no fucking reason... i hate periods. they make me suicidal for about a day, and the rest of the week im a complete cunt to everyone. need some happy pills for them.

just wanna sort things with him.
an i cant yet...cuz of him having to leave.

and now that i;ve seen him. i dont know what to do.

going out tonight, that should be gooooooooood, feel like some wine. not red red wine. but white wine. or basically any alcohol, just to releive my fucking shit mood."

how lucky i am, to have had someone for a year, who aint strayed, who just wanted me.i cant do this. might never feel again how i do now. 

been incredibly hard faced, and bitchy today.. to try and cope.
bin to tesco with a mate, and im just crying my eyes out again.. listening to Honeyz - love of a lifetime.why do i have to hurt him, i dunno..i feel like the bad person. im so confused. 

comfort eating does not help.
ate a whole pack of cookie dough. i feel sick. i wana stick my fingers down my throat, hurt myself and make myself suffer for being such an evil bitch.
because i hate myself today. im not nice.
made myself some rice for lunch..managed to burn it. im so fucking stupid, how the fuck do u even burn rice ?! 

think my period is late cuz i've been worried, and so anxious this month.
horrible horrible horrible.

just been sat staring into space today...i feel awful, just want someone to spend time with me tonight, i dont wanna sleep on my own, i want someone to cuddle up to me. not that im the most cuddly shaped person. but hey.

theres no point to this entry. just feeling really low.
might dose myself up with some meds and vodka."

"event","so, i intended on speaking to jay this evening.
i feel like im being a right hard faced little cow about the whole thing.
but it just helps me cope with how worthless i feel.
like i confided to becky, the only reason i make a joke of ''feeling single'', and complainin bout jay always been tired etc, and saying shit like i wouldnt feel guilty if i cheated, is because thats the only way i can cope. by laughing at it, by putting on a big front, and humouring myself. but like i said to her, i dont regret whats happend...

its like when i've been saying that stuff to people. afterwards, i either go to the toilet and get myself 2gether, hold back the tears, or i go home and cry, break down because of how bad i feel, that i love someone who makes me feel that i dont matter. nobody else understands properly cuz they arnt with him. but tonight, i stopped laughing at the whole thing, and broke down and actually cried my eyes out in front of somebody. i dont think she knew how to deal with it. but i feel better i think, it does upset me, and yeah, i do love him, and i know i love him. i just am afraid to hurt him. i dont want to prove people right,because i dunno, got this warped idea that deep down, they are jealous of my relationship. and how long i've been with someone, and they just wish they was in love. that probably sounds really stupid.
but im speaking to him on tuesday afternoon. how is it, he can just take the time off for a doctors appointment [ the entire afternoon] and yet, he cant spare an hour all week for me ? im not a demanding person. im laid back, and i understand people have commitments to work and seeing other people. but ..im his girlfriend. and i feel like an old friend he only sees at like, xmas or something. 


if we do split up i do want us still to be close.
i do still want us to spend days and nights together.
maybe even have holidays and weekends away.
just have this close, exclusive thing that only us two understand.
but i dont know whether i could sleep with him again,as in have sex. i'd feel uncomfortable about it. i feel uncomfortable about sleeping with people full stop, i always think i must be a pretty big dissapointment to them.
 im probably just DELUDING MYSELF about everything i've just written.


on a far more cheerful note. I DONT REGRET A SECOND OF THE PAST WEEK.NOTHING AT ALL. NOT ONE LITTLE THING.I HAVE BEEN OVER THE MOON, AND HAPPIER THAN I HAVE BEEN IN A LONG WHILE. HAD A BRILLIANT WEEKEND.


why do i do this.

hope tomorrow is a nice day."

<small>today. went out last night and i was so unbeleivably happy.
had an amazing night  :) :) 
many many many funny moments.
'' this little ray of sunshine''
'' well your mate cant of been chatting me up very well, i dont remember him !''

random guy ''you must hear this everyday...but your quite something else''
me '' awh, thank you, you as well ! ''
random guy '' me ? you must be joking, i've got a nose like a corkscrew [WTF?!?!] and  a double chin like you wont beleive''
me : ''oh..dont put youself down !''


deary me....

today i woke up at stupid o clock.
got wrapped up and went for a walk. me being me, i cant just go for a walk and not encounter a wierdo. a friendly wierdo. the security guy at peoples park. hes black, and called raymond. he wants me to go and see him tomorrow. he told me his life story. god. i only wanted to just go to the park for a mooch.
anyway had breakfast at house of fraser, got a coffee from starbucks and went and sat in the park feeding the ducks.

then on the way back down ainslie street i saw the prettiest cat ever ! it was grey and white and had such a girly face awwww. so i sat on the pavement with it. i love cats.


jay just text me saying he made 400 quid in 2 hours.
i text back saying theres more to life than money.

got to talk to him about whats going to happen between us today. i didnt want to throw a year of commitment and memories away, but i dont know what to do...
thats the only thing makin me sad ttoday...deciding what to do.
if he just went away and i never saw him again, i'd be fine.
but becuz its me deciding stuff, thats what hurts.

hes a good person deep down. i dont wanna fail him.

gonna go see becks at half 7. i hope she can help me. but shes not the best person to ask as shes never had a long relationship

dont wanna ruin my happy mood so thats it for today

Do you miss me
I hear you say you do
But not the way Im missing you

Oh would it mean anything
If you knew
What Im left imagining
In my mind

Would you go

having a boring day. look shit, despite the ammount of warpaint i've shoveled onto my face. went to morrisons, spotted danny, but i hid, because i looked hideous, and i didnt want him to think oh god wtf was i doing with her.
bought lots of healthy food. got some melon for tea. and some water thats helps the metabolism. brown rices. etc etc. might sound like boring food to other people, but i like it i guess.s. if i cut down my alcohol intake and did more excersise i'd be perfect. i can get discount at going swimming now im on jobseekers. just need to apply for a card i guess...
went into town to get a new liquid eyeliner, it was horrible i hate town. lots and lots of creepy men, i hate the way men look at people its awful. its not nice. it just makes me feel uncomfortable. had some sleeping tablets and went to sleep, so i had a gap in my day, turned the heating up so i'd drift offf and not be bored. now im awake again and full of energy.
i am in the mood to cook a massive dinner for someone. but im not gonna do that for myself. it would be a waste, and very stupid.

i need to see becks but she'll probably be tired after going to leeds.
think amys pissed off with me because i didnt go to leeds, but it wasnt my fault !
i may ring her to explain, but that will sound like i'm bitching at becks, which im not. ahh im a tool. some people need bitching at .

gonna go now. as i started shivering again."

"event","today now. pretty gay or whatever but i've got a lot to say.
was meant to be going to leeds for a date. which i decided not to. [just a lunch thing]
but i was also asked to go to leeds this friday to see some girlfriends.
and i was like, yeah thats great, cuz i assumed i'd be going with Becks. and contribute to petrol money, as it would be stupid me gettin the train as we are off to the same place and we have tha same mutual friends and all that, and we both speak about how much we miss em and stuff.
but i was texting Becks like the other day and what have you, and she was saying ''i feel bad you cant come to leeds, but im stopping with owen [her mate]'' so i text back, saying i have people in leeds who i can stop with like, my godmums daughter Alice, Graeme [who i aint seen] not to mention amy who wanted me to come down anyway
back to my point i was like, oh its ok, i could stop with graeme ?
she texts back asking who graeme was and i said oh just a mate. and i never heard anything back.
so it just obvious she dont wanna spend time with me or whatever...this must sound pathetic but i miss two of my best mates, i've got an opportuity to see them, and i cant, even though i have somewhere to stay, and money to help with petrol ?
wtf is that about. shes my mate but im really pissed off with her. like if we plan to do something on a night time, she'll cancel bout half an hour before, stuff like thats whats annoys me.


if people dont wanna spend time with me, or dont want be to be with em, why cant they just say.

i think hes lonely, and i know how that feels. i think he feels hes failed at life and i know that feels bad too. i think we would have a lot in common, if only we could open up to each other. but we are both shit at that an it will never happen.

but i love my dad. despite everything. nothing is his fault at all. 

i wish i was a better communicator.
want to make someones life better.

need to text jay and tell him im not coping with not seeing him.


because im not. and i dont get why he cant stay at mine. and i dont get why he cant see me after work. he knows i'll cook for him, he knows i'll let him sleep, he knows he can have a bath and a shave....so i dont get wtf is wrong with my house ?!?!?!?!?
both my parents speak to him and make an effort with him, and take an interest [more than his do to me] so its clearly not my rents that he feels intimidated by or w/e ?

i wrote this last night in my normal diary. but i need to go through it again with myself.

i feel compelled to sort my head out and stop being so selfish. the language of love letters is the same as suicide notes. i have both under my bed, cuz he dont want the letters i write him. i wouldnt either. ever wanted to be with someone but didnt know why ?  gues thats womens intuition...
came close to telling people [yes more than one, fucking shoot me] how i feel about them tonight, but as usual im too pussy.
thats a bad trait of mine. i feel so easily threatened by other people, like women, competition wise...thats insecurity though because i am hideous.
i want tattoos
1. ''i cant grow a new heart''
2. '' even the ugliest among us have made our lovers beg''
oh and a cheeky ''enjoy yourself'' above my bikini line.

want a nice non sexual relationship in the near future.
[although thats wat i have...im not laughing...he seems repulsed by me]
i would be repulsed too. im beyond ugly.

been crying tonnes tonight, watched Igby Goes Down..that set me off, then a bit of texting made it worse.

im not going to leeds. i'll look stupid.
not stopping at chris's either. see how he likes feeling stupid
only one or maybe more people left to fuck with. not that im a mean person, i just get bored of peopleplaying games with me and treating me like shit.
i dont beleive in doing anything unless people learn from it, supose tht makes me a control freak and perfectionist....like why break up with someone if they dont change, grow, or learn..NONE you just look stupid and alone..and i get aroused? dunno ...if thats right but....by structure, comfort, and securtiy== and i crave routine.

- besides anyone who ever suposedly ''likes'' me gets bored and moves on to someones usually fatter and uglier with no personality, and no morals.
but whatever you like. i hate skanky girls.
- i'd be a stripper if i didnt disgust myself.
- omgod i hate sleeping with new peopple, its the worst feeling in tha world...and if i EVER sleep with another person [highly doubtful] it will be with my top on and the lights off. i feel sorry for that person for pulling tha ugly chick. i.e me.
i dont do much sept drink, apply for jobs i know i wont get [coz i feel like i should] and spend large portions of tha day fantasizing over those i cant have, because i lack integrity.

wants to have another drink but i'll end up bitter again.

want a tattoo of heart shaped box. cuz thats where i am
[ and i collect them]


thats all
still shivering
still too skinny to love
still havent heard from ma boyf.
hes busy doing other things...

<small> went out last night, had rather a lot to drink as i had stuff on my mind and that, was actually really angry and annoyed with myself, but i looked better than usual so who cares really ? dont know about that studio underground been better than gullies though...its cheaper...and it has clean toilets....but i wouldnt say its better. although i did like the toilets haha.
me and lolly spoke to some guy called dean coz we recognised him...he was strange...but i did recognise him.
haha bless.
tall though. i like tall men.
havent done much. popped out for lunch *cough*..less said about that the better. all this sneaking about i do, but went home and didnt eat coz i feel ill and i cant stop shivering. having said that my room is like a sauna at the minute.
stayed in bed all afternoon, might be creative tomorrow. wanna go to hull, get some hooker shoes white ones. i feel an outfit coming on. i love being able to wear what i like now. its amazing. im so much happier.

been thinking about affairs today after reading love it. i wouldnt be above having affair, the other person always gets treated better anyway, like the ''other woman/man'' who theyb are cheating with, not on...i know i would treat someone like golddust.  people say they would never cheat, because they think they are above it, but really, none of us our, i cheat myself mentally everyday of the week, so yeah, from now on i just do what feels good. people always assume cheating is something sexual..it really isnt an ''affair of the heart'' i know howthat feels. im not being selfish. and im not sayin i want an affair. i just want more for myself and i dont get why thats so wrong..

i need to cool down gonna overheat. want to book a holiday for easter, it would be cheaper if i got other people to come with me, but i dont think anyone would be up for going really.
people who are always ''skint'' suposedly, piss their money up the wall all the time. pffffft

havent heard/seen/or spoke to jay today. living a seperate life. hes hugely important to me, and i'll never have anyone who puts up with half the shit he does. let alone anyone who will put up with my skanky, scarred body. that must be a real turn off. no wonder he wont sleep with me. im thin, men dont like thin girls....i want someone who likes me being thin.i hate myself for not being good enough for him, it would hurt if he had someone perfect..i wish i was better for him, wish i looked better but i dont. and i need money to change it.im disgusting
i dont miss him today. i just miss company.

anyway. need to cool down.
thats all i have to say"

<small>
just been applying for jobs today, i need to work. i am on the dole but i cant tell jay because he'd be ashamed of me, those are his words, and not mine. i dunno why, at least im looking for a job, at least i have some money, and im not miserable, and i can go out with my friends and stuff. for gods sake...its not the worst thing in the world. i dont like how he judges people so much. he just gets everything handed to him on a plate..he cannot comment.
i still havent stopped shivering. watched the 6th sense last night, cried loads at the end when that man is telling his wife how much he loves her etc etc. stuff isnt like films though is it, nothing that you look forward to is ever as good as people make out, sex, alcohol,smoking, drugs, love. its never as good as you hoped. maybe thats just me being ungrateful.
going out tonight. woo woo.
managed 4 nights last week, and that wasnt a problem so im happy im not stopping in again.
just applied 4 about 6 jobs. hope i get some sort of response, i think its really bad manners how nobody even takes the time to contact you, letting you know you havent got the job., 
but actually i know a lot of people with bad manners...i just dont like bad manners !!!!
think my laptop battery is gonna run out soon. i've been using my dads charger as mine broke. i wanna live with someone i can look after, but not jay, as we would bicker. i dont want to be ''the wife'' figure ...
i just wanna have a ''thing'' with someone, i wouldnt hurt them or whatever, and i wouldnt say it wud be a casual thing, but i like relationships where they dont have a name to live up to....seeing people...but with more commitment...???yes??? if mine had stayed like that everything wud be ite. but no.


anyway. gonna go post cvs. writing sorts my head out. im positive :)"

<small><b> jay came round the other night, but not for long, he was meant to be working etc doing product demos. he starts off all happy to see me and then just acts unbothered, sulky and sleepy. i love him with all my heart but im seeing less an less of him, so we cant spend proper time together. i dont drive, and buses stop after he finishes work so this makes it harder. plus the fact hes always tired. i want him in my life. but maybe how i do that will have to change....
i have stopped denying that i have some sorta feelings for someone else, not that im open about it, i never would be but, y'no. i complicate things

been out 4 nights this week
not bad at all
felt lots happier
had a good time. even though on friday myself and becky were dancing with the biggest sleaze in gy aka joe cutting. hes quite funny when hes drunk though, and i was just being sarcastic, and laughing lots.

im gonna get healthy.
swim
gym
you name it. but i'll always fucking love whiskey....

"event","like an old friend.
i havent posted, as i've been in love for the past year.


you can expect much more of me.
this is 20 things i want. something like an explaination.
aside from being in love, i've been drinking a lot, and not very much else.
i also have trouble sleeping.
 this is my twenty.

1. To paint more often. I'd love my artwork on display one day. Its not accademically brilliant, but then again, its an expression of what goes on in my head, Similarly i'd like my writing published, even though its fucked up, muddled, and makes no sense. Either that or be able to share what i write, diaries, poems, random scribbles, with someone i feel comfortable with letting into my mind.

2. To feel uninhibited intimacy for someone, and teach them to do the same. I want to change someones life for the better. I always find people i want to look after, who dont WANT looking after...yet i want to protect them against everything, and be there...even though they dont realise. I want to be someones addiction..instead of something more negative..i want to teach someone how to feel passion the way i do...in a way, i want to be in tune, with someones mind body and spirit,...and be everything they wanted and more.

3. To have a part in a movie. Growing up, i always wanted to be an actress, and i had acting classes, and a real talent for a while. But as with everything in my life, i gave it up, like piano, and singing lessons. One day i'd like to get back into acting as its something i feel strongly about, and passionate towards. Besides that, i know i am a good actress. i wouldn't mind singing either, although not as a career, as its something that was always private for me.

4. To be intelligent, i'm not intelligent on paper. I dont feel i do well academically. but everyone is critical of themselves. I want to be the person who changes things. I want to change the fact that a bit of paper and a grade can state how intelligent you suposedly are. I think its really wrong. 

5. To have the ability to tell people how i feel about them. At the minute, circumstances wont allow me to admit that i have intense, mixed up feelings for one  person, as i am in a relationship with someone else. As usual i cant mention it, and keep it bottled up as people jump to conclusions, so my choices change. I'd just like them to somehow know that i feel a great deal for them, , and maybe situations will change for us  i beleive in fate, lets hope it chooses wisely, with evryone being happy. 2 happy people are better than 4 miserable ones

6. To have a better social life. I dont have many friends, and the time i spend with my boyfriend is limited due to where he lives. However one day, i would like to enjoy a fuller social life, with a wide circle of different people. Instead of just having my alcohol for company.

7. To be rich. Money cant buy you happiness, but it can buy you choices, freedom and style. I would love to make decent money, and i would have even more fun choosing how to invest it, as well as spending it. Deep inside me, there is a buisness woman wanting to escape, and i would really like someone to guide me in the ways of buisness , teaching me about usefull ways to make money, and invest wisely. 

8. To never feel jealousy again. Its an ugly word, an ugly habit and an ugly feeling. If i never felt jealous again it would be too soon. I hate it when people im close to spend time with people i dislike, due to my own personal beleifs etc. And i dislike most women, due to jealousy, even if there is nothing particularly attractive about them.

9. To have someone guide me through decisions. I have my own mind, but coming to making it work is another thing. i want options but i often have too many or not enough. decision making makes me uneasy at the best of times. but i beleive that with gentle guidance, it would stop me making rash decisions and really help me on my way to becoming a better person. i basically need a miniture budha.

10. To have friends whom i can rely on and trust. I can count my friends on my hand. I have friendship, but not in the way i perceive a friendship to be. I need people. Despite not wanting to admit that i ever need anyone. 24hours a day 7 days a week, but knows that with me, comes my mind, and therefore my baggage. for once i'd love someone to read me inside out, without me saying a thing, but that person would probably be the person i spend my life with. 

11. To have perfect health. I took my health for granted until i was in hospital feeling intense pain and loneliness. I dont ever want to be in ill health again. I need to start looking after and respecting my body, and getting into some sort of routine. 

12. To make my family/friends proud. For them to encourage me and to have good feelings towards me. I count my mothers friends as my friends. And i love the qualities each of them has. One day, i hope to have this too. and i am glad they encourage me, and want me to do well.

13. To model. Currently i have given up modelling for personal reasons. One day in the future, i would like to be a sucessful model.

14. To feel beautiful. I want more than anything to be happy with my appearance. However this is difficult when you have a huge rib shaped scar, and you used to have a thing for revealing clothes. I sometimes think that sometimes my scar is a punishment of some sort, for being well proportioned/slim  with a ''pretty'' face etc. Perhaps i'm a fucked up beauty. I want someone else to find me genuinely beautiful. and to not see my ''flaws'' as actual ''flaws'', at the same time, i dont want anyone with a scar fetish.

15. To be successful. I want to live comfortably. Have a reasonably good job. And be able to travel. Unrealistic. Probably wont happen.

16. To get tattooed. Its very permanent. So i'd like something that means something to me . ''i dont ever want to feel, like i did that day, take me to the place i love, take me all the way'' would be a fantastic thing to have tattooed across my scar, as its one of the things that has made me feel the lowest in my life....those lyrics also hold a lot of significance to me..

17. To be free of my demons. I've spent a lot of time struggling with issues and fighting with myself and I'd like one day to be happy with me. I'd like to feel safe in my own skin, and comfortable with who i am, when i eventually find out who that is.

18. To be loved.Really loved. I want someone to love me uncontrollably and miss me whenever I'm gone and to dream of me when they sleep and to tell me they love me everyday and whenever they get the urge. I want to be loved how I love, obsessively. At the same time, i want to love someone who accepts me for me, doesn't try to change what makes me happy. In other words, i'd like to marry a mind reader. or at least someone who can read me. I would like someone with their own life, friends, and interests.

19. To never contradict myself again. I do it a lot and it irritates me. My opinions contradict themselves, and i truly beleive i am two people living in one body. I am happy with my boyfriend to a point, and i hate the idea of failing at something like a relationship, i want to make it work, to prove everybody and myself wrong. At the same time, i love the idea that i could love more than one person, and can commit to more than one person. I want to experiance as much as possible in this life, and love the idea of meeting a lot of people, being in relationships, and bringing out different elements of  myself and my personality.

20. To have pets. I love anything small and helpless. I hate the idea of anything being lonely or unloved. Nothing ever deserves to feel like that. I  want to rescue a number of cats, and have guinea pigs, french lop eared rabbits and chinchillas."

"event","in a couple of years at least.
i just need something to write right now, try and make sense of things.

for the first time in my life im in a long term  'stable ' relationship with a boyfriend,its a whole year next month.
this scares me slightly.
its like some sort of acheivement for me.

but like, as always a number of things are wrong, hes a very angry person and has a volatile side to him which i dont like. and i think that he feels now that he has me he doesnt have to try anymore [ we were seeing each other for 7 months] / perhaps im spoilt because i had my honeymoon period for such a lenthy time.
but i think, if you work at things, a honeymoon period can last forever.
hes tight with money, wel not tight he just always brings the subject up wi=hich is something i hate, and hes sparing with his time for me.
i need lots of affection and stuff, so this is hard. when he was seeing me he wud come see me all the time, invite me to stuff, and now its like he doesnt want me around. i nearly broke up with him but he didnt seem bothered.
didnt want to give him the satisfaction of giving some bullshit lines to another girl ''you've made me feel alive again'' etc.
also
as its been a long while i dont wanna give it all up just for nothing.
it seems such a waste.
he knows so much about me and we've really built it up. so its a shame that it wouldnt work.
i dont know.
he doesnt seem to care. i just feel unloved and under valued a lot of the time.
many people tell me how lucky my boyfriend is [not that i always belive them] so i wonder why cant he see that ? why cant he fight to keep me.

hes losing me 
and im losing him
and i dont like it. 
i hate having no control over stuff

if its reaching the end ad cant be resurected well theres nothing i can do..


i dont know
i wish everything was all happy
he just rejects everything i do for him and constantly blames me for stuff



got stuff to do
so i'll end before i get bitter

some bad. 
basically
- been for a few good nights out. 3 people down from the saturday night crew.
- zabrina is coming home this weekend, so i'll probably be out on saturday
- tuesday onwards moving in with becky. 

in other news 
- bjorn likes me, in that way.
- i dont know how i feel.
- i dont really see much of HIM anymore. i think things have sort of just, burned out, hes too out of it to notice or need me, and i dont think i can do anymore
- college is okay. 
- went to the Torsohorse gig last saturday. it was shit. the atmosphere was shit. the people were shit. and the band themselves were pretty shit. we haven't admitted what a boring night we had. but no-one was out we came home dead early.
- had an ace day last sunday with tam and amy. 
- single. hmm
- i'm having lots of me time. looking after number one, because fuck, no other bastard is going to do it. no matter how much you genuinely feel for someone they'll always let you down, everntually, after they've built up your trust and made you so happy, theres no point, my defences are up, and i'm finding it hard to trust people again after whats happend recently.
- got some leopard print tights today
- went to Brightstart on monday night. how shit was thatm me and becky lost everyone, so spent the evening with joe, it was ok, the bands were blatantly shit. but it was a laugh i guess.
- dont know what im doing on halloween. loz is having a party before, which im of to but i dont know what im doing on the actual night.
- realised how much i've been spending. its gotta stop. 
- beckys having a party on tuesday. should be good. apparently ross has promised to be nice to me *raises eyebrows* it'll all be an act anyway. but i'll havve a good time, i will i will. 
- im bored of people floating in and out of my life, give me something complete plz ?

ross gave me wierd revelations last night...i didnt spill my feelings like he did. i might rite him a letter.
i feel bad that i dont feel the same way, maybe one day i'll wake up and realise how lucky i was, but you cant be with someone just to make them happy.
i'm having a new beggining and i think i like it. 
there is a lot of the opposite sex in my life, in odd ways, like im not exactly with someeeeee people, but , i think i have an understanding with them still...i cant really write what i mean.
i have no money.

and stumbled across some of the ...private collection lol

"event","lots has happened i think. 
- college induction . 
- off to the gig tomorrow night though with ella haha only a fiver
- ross asked me to go to this party at jamies and hes just appeared at my house, amy rings me at the most inconvenient times too, like...right when ross and jamie arrive. my mum also ruins my lies ""shes not going out now"" when i just sent a text saying i was off to cleethorpes at 8. stupid bint. bex was ill or summat thats why shes not of..dunno tbh. maybe i shud have gone
ah well. 
- i feel bad for not going. i always feel guilty recently. i dont like it.  i shouldnt feel bad for having a mind of my own. 
pissed off tbh.
was well happy. 
- had a nice day today went into town with ella and we had lunch with brian in pizza hut was dead good ate loads n then had some cake too, laughed at a skater falling over, hes ellas stalker 
-  shes dead hot1!!!!!!. had a bit of a catch up. 
- saw the guy who tried to nick my bag etc getting out a car walking home from ellas,he didnt see me, got a good idea of where he lives now, i felt really calm for some reason, i've felt loads better, so next week its all geting sorted, gavs mate said he'd help me, and we had a long talk today, he can pick me up with one arm, hes well strong, so he should have no problem at all. hes ace :) 

- i feel bad about this whole party thing, its crap how guilty i always feel about stuff. i think i should make other people happy instead of myself mayeb i'd be better then, i felt ok before amy rang me . dunno its my own fault. tsssk. gonna have to be nicer if i ever want someone, he'll find someone else, bet he will and then i'll realise. i will. i'll finally realise how lucky i was and what i threw away. ttssssssk"

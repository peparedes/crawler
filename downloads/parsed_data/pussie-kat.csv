"event","YAY! I got the receptionist job! It is going to be hard too but I believe I can do it. I have a couple of great people working with me too, so it should be fun! Another receptionist named Madison is going to be working with me. She is really cool. We went to Orlando on Saturday for a receptionist meeting or ""boot camp"" as they called it. It wasn't a boot camp but it was to help us become better at what we do. So that's pretty cool. Today is Mother's Day and I totally forgot to get both of my mothers cards. :( I actually was going to get some but it totally slipped my mind until like 10pm last night. GRRR. Oh well! Well that is all that is going on with me. I will write more when I have things to say/tell. *mwah* :-D"

"event","YAY! I just finished my first official year in college. Wow. That was one of the best years of my life! Thank you to my wonderful boyfriend for being there for me, even during the bad times. Thank you to my new and old friends for being there for me as well and being so nice to me and helping me adapt to college. I had a great time talking/being with all of you! I'm taking summer classes this year from June 23rd-August 5th. That should be fun. I'm going to try and get a job, but we'll see. Right now I'm at Jeff's (my boyfriend's) house in Merritt Island for the weekend. It's going to be so hard for 8 weeks without him. I know that many people don't see their boyfriend's months at a time, but after being with your boyfriend everyday of the week for 8 months, it's going to be hard to live without him but I am going to try my best to get by. I can't wait to see my Step-mom, Dad, Sara (my step-sis), and Brandon (my step-brpther). They are all great people and I did miss them while I was in school.

So tomorrow is the first day of May huh? Wow, time went by so fast. I remember when it was the first day of classes back in August. I remember when I first met my hunnie in Jared's room. I never thought I would have ended up with him but he was so sweet to me and he is such a great person! I love you Jeff!!! 

But anyways, nothing else going on. Just the start of my summer! WOOHOO!! Summer 2005 had finally started. I hope I get to enjoy my summer and not have to work my butt off the whole time. As soon as I get back to Jax I'm going to get a job for the summer and then for the rest of the year, that is my plan anyway. :-D

Sorry I haven't written in a while...Love you all! *mwah*"

I feel so bad for her, bad things seem to happen to her a lot now :( I have two papers due in the next couple of days, but oh well. That is what happens near the end of the semester. Only a couple weeks to go. My new ring came in today. I bought it off of eBay. It is a very pretty ring. I love rings! :-D So anyways, nothing really new except those few things. *mwah* BYE!"

"event","School is coming to a close end. My freshman year of college has gone by so quickly it's not even funny. So many god things and bad things have happened in the past year or so. College has really changed me for the good I think because it has taught me so much and has given me more patience. I have made many friends at UNF and I made a wonderful boyfriend. I couldn't ask for anything better than that. I do miss home sometimes but my new life is so much better then my old. I have been so busy lately doing papers and studying for tests. It seems like it will never end, but then I think that I really only have like two weeks of school left and I get sad.

I didn't get as involved in things this year as I wanted to, or was hoping to. I believe it was because I got a boyfriend that I wasn't expecting. I did get involved a little bit with the stupid politics at my school this year though. That was fun yet disheartening at the same time. Grrr...stupid politics. Now I know why you should never trust a politician. And with this whole Skate Park thing really pisses me off. I hate the fact that even though no one wants it, our future president is still going to go through with it. Argh!

Anyways, I'll be in Jacksonville for half of the summer. I'm taking Summer B classes and then I'll be in the village for the Fall. YAY! I hope I get Katie Haslach as my roommate because if I don't, I don't want a random roommate. I already saw how bad that could be, not with my roommate this year but with other people. I guess we'll see what happens.

Alright I'm done for tonight. G'night everyone and remember: Life...is full of surprises"

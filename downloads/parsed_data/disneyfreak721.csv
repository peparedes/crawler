I would like to publically and officially announce that I am going to retire from the LJ community. I will leave the account so I can read those entries that my friends still make, but I seriously doubt I will enter into this one again on a regular basis and will continue to solely use my Myspace blog and that alone. I will also keep this account so I have the past archive from last year on."

(Tapestry of Dreams music lyrics to be precise)

Since it's been so long since I last updated....(SEE MYSPACE BLOG FOR MORE DETAILS) 

Last time I left you all hanging at how hard it would be for me to go to that Disney presentation and go along with the interview and whether or not i should stay in San Fran....

Well here's the hizzy fo shizzy.... I got accepted and am moving to beautiful Lake Buena Vista, Florida in January. Though I will miss everyone here in this fog filled greatness...leaving them will be a great opportunity for my pansy disney asshole-self. And most of them are cool with it since they know I'm coming back next august anyway! For oregonians who still read this (Ahem, Sarah) I know that this may come as a shock... but I will be up there before I move out to FL."

"event","So as those of you who actually SEE ME may have noticed by now, and to be fair, most of you who READ ME probably noticed it too, I've been in a wierd mood as of late. In less than 48 hours, something that I have wanted to attend for the last, well since before I graduated high school actually, will be rolling through town.

This of course, is the presentation for the Walt Disney World College Program (WDWCP). I know what most of you, especially my non-san fran friends (the classics) are thinking: ""Oh YAY! He'll go interview/audition, he'll get in, and he'll move to Orlando as planned YEARS ago! Good for him!""

Here's where things get interesting.... Ask me if I was going to be where I am now a year ago, and I would have laughed. ""HA! San Francisco.... what the hell is there for me in San Francisco?!"" Especially seeing as the fact that I came here was rather impulsive, and the reason why i actually did no longer exists. Ask me now if I still want to go to Orlando, and something that once took no thought whatsoever, ""Hell Yeah I'll go"" now has one of those deep breaths and a look to the sky to actually THINK ABOUT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. I'm so involved in my school that I'm actually seriously considering changing my major... I have grown to love almost every person in this house that I live with and am almost willing to put off the Orlando for another 4 months JUST so I can at least finish off the year with them, and I dont want to give up school for some entry level job possibly selling turkey legs at a cart or a sweatshirt at the Main St. Emporium...

But then there are the finer points to the WDWCP as well...and I've put it off for so long as it is....free access to the parks 24/7, meeting a whole new bunch of people (though the ones here are hard to beat) getting the start (regardless of how crappy it may be) in the industry I want to be in, WITH the company that I want to work with...and then it would be saving my parents money for School when/if I eventually return. PLUS I can still take classes online WHILE I'm there... 

SIGH

It's not like I can't wait just ONE more semester....but on the other hand It's not like I have anything tying me down here (girlfriend, dying family member, etc)....I am VERY on the fence with this one... BUT to be fair,  I haven't even interviewed/auditioned yet...so I don't know if I even got in (though its been said its pretty much guaranteed for a creature like me) so I really have no basis to make this decision on. SO what I HAVE decided is that I will go to the interview/presentation/audition thingy just to see what happens, but therein lies the other problem. If I DO get in, I KNOW i won't be able to say no. I wont. ""Hi...would you like to come live on Disney World Property, be able to play in the parks whenever you please, gain experience in the field you want a career in, keep your dorm like lifestyle, while still taking classes at your school, and get paid to do it?!"" 

Seems like a pretty easy answer to me. Its just saying it that may be the hard part."

1. SO I found that there IS IN FACT an Olive Garden in this city. It's over by SF State. So not only do I risk running into that Stephen kid from Laguna Beach, But I also have to trek across the damn city. Frankie and Jen and I found it the other night after a trip to the beach, but we did not stop to eat for Jen had already made dinner and niether Frankie or I had money. But I so desperately want an Unlimited Pasta Bowl.

2. I'm still living in my childhood thanks to my recent purchase of Fraggle Rock season 1. I'm surprised that it still retains my attention so well as so few things do.

3. My eyes are really dry and I'm listening to Michael Buble's song, ""Home."" Which is both uplifting and depressing. It's a strange paradox.

4. Halloween costume debate continues. I'm thinking of Pee Wee Herman, Powerline (the pop star in A Goofy Movie), well thats pretty much it actually. We might do an 80s movie theme in the house which would be awesome... we'll see if we can get Matt to be Marty Mcfly since the resemblance is already strong enough.

5. I dont know if I still want to go to Orlando this december as a key part of my favorite fireworks show (illuminations) has been damaged and removed indefinitely (it exploded) and basically made the first minute and a half (which may be the best part of the show) pointless. Given, yes, I haven't seen how they changed it yet, but I DOUBT it's as good as what it was. And I may just wait until it returns.

Well let me rephrase...this is the last time i let gel sit in my hair for at least a day without washing it out. I normally dont go this long without a shower....i feel so grubby...like a street rat or something.

My cell phone has been turned off briefly...I guess I was supposed to actually pay for it or something. That will be taken care of tomorrow. 

Last night the party started at about 5:30 or so at Happy hour, and continued far into the night with me not hitting the sheets until about 1 AM or so. But I must add that Karaoke is a great way to liven up any shitty situation, like having a dead cell phone. 

I'm going through all the music on my computer getting rid of stuff...how many copies of ""Danger Zone"" did I neeed?! I will admit to the great find I had with the breakfast club soundtrack buried deep within my ornate filing system. Oh the shit that was in there and is now gone, including but not limited to ""Come on Over"" by Christina Aguilera, and Craig David's classic ""Fill me in""

WOW. 

My wicked orlando craving is getting worse and worse...It's been over two years since I was last there, so much new shit that i have missed the opening of, AND AND AND I need to find someone to go with that can partake in Drinks Around the World at Epcot....specifically to watch over me since apparently I need a babysitter since my RA sends someone to the bars with me after Monday's incident...when that was very Atypical of me. However, at Epcot, the cards will change since I'm probably gonna be super excited just to be there as it is. I want to go in December to get it out of my system right quick...but Megan (And Shaun (And Leilani)) want to go in May for Star Wars Weekends...

"event","So...amazingly enough, when I have things on my mind, I tend to dwell on them and in some situations... they affect me to a point where I am no longer able to sleep. Given, at this point right now, I could fall asleep if I wanted to, but I wont since I work in a few hours, and guaranteed will sleep past any sort of alarm. But the one thing that gets me most about this whole thing is that instead of one large problem getting at my brain, it's a few small ones. Almost minute ones for that matter.

1. Walt Disney World College Program (WDWCP)
Every year around this time the new presentation schedule comes out to see when the recruiters go to what school, and when. Now if I apply in the fall, that would mean I would leave for Florida in the Spring. Now the big question with this is, Do I go? A pro and con list has yet to be made, but generally...we all know the perks...grounding in basic Disney Career with great opportunities for advancement, BUT....I already have a pretty upwardly mobile resume (Hardware Store to Photographer to Promotions Assistant) to give it up (and a semester of school) to live in a 3 BR Apartment with 5 other people and have an entry level job from anything like a Turkey Leg vendor to something like a Jungle Cruise Skipper (Pending a good audition) or a cashier at a gift shop, all of which make roughly 6.30 an hour, and you have to work enough to cover rent (90 some-odd dollars a week) and food/survival money for a step on the bottom rung of the mouse-house ladder. So do I stay at it with what I'm doing, hoping I can just fork over a portfolio to Imagineering, or take longer, get the same portfolio and throw it at Imagineering with a few name drops and some disney career background?

2. Birthday gifts
There are a few people in my life who have given me so so much...especially on my birthday, well now their birthday is coming up and I have the best Idea for a gift but the problem is that it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and it can be semi-expensive, since it's a destination gift as opposed to a material gift. So not only would i have to pay for the gift, but i'd also have to pay for myself to go as well, and I'd really feel like shit forking over another card when I can work my ass off for something spectacular. 

3. That Damn Mouse part 2
I was at ""The Big DL"" about a week and half ago as most know, and while I love going by myself, and not have any problem, there was one thing that bothered me. I know that I can have just a wee little more fun at Disneyland/WDW besides by myself. Okay, two things, but one in particular. The other is just being with a large group of friends, which is totally awesome at the parks, but the main one hit me like a ton of bricks on Saturday (July 16th) night. I was in line for space mountain watching a very cute couple (not more than 19) just have fun together. It was touching, and sad because I have experienced it from that angle, and thus far in my life, that is the greatest way to spend a day in the park. And it made me nostalgic and want that again. But, at the same time, we all remember that attachments lead to pain, and pain leads to suffering....etc etc etc... and it made me want to go with a potential couple candidate (see #4), or with a big group of friends. I don't know. NOT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE FUN LAST WEEKEND THOUGH!!! I had a blast! It just made me want that little bit more...

4. Couple Candidates
Two ""Ls"" (as usual), One ""S"", One ""M"", one ""N"" are all leading to aggravation...."

"event","Okay,so two things to catch up on.

The great grand and glorious weekend of July 15th-18th. That of course being the 50th anniversary of Disneyland weekend. Which was totally awesome, since, as previously mentioned, I was there for.

It started friday afternoon when I landed in Anaheim, and knew that this trip to the ""Big DL"" was going to be different when I'm on the supershuttle from the Airport to the hotels and was seated next to two rabid disney fans, ironically enough from Eugene, OR. They told me they were there for this monumental weekend as well, and then a full on debate on DCA, Eisner, and Iger ensued. Friday was also the opening of the ""re-imagineered"" Space Mountain, which I didn't experience on Friday as I was too late to get a fast pass and really didnt feel like waiting 180 minutes in the standby line (that's 3 hours Boys and Girls), when I could go first thing the next morning.

I also hung out in the virtual ghosttown that was Disney's California Adventure park. Example: Haunted Mansion at DL's wait: 25 Minutes.... Tower of Terror at DCA: Walk-on. Splash Mountain: 120 minutes ; Grizzly River Run: 10 minutes. (I still opted for Single Rider) The only ride with any real wait was of course, Soarin, at 50 minutes. It was downright depressing.

Saturday I went to Space mountain early and was greatly impressed. The two years were well worth it. The ride is so much smoother now,  and the best part, to me at least, is the music. The music rocks and had me laughing in joy the entire time....likt there will be a really low note all of a sudden, and thats when you're flying to your right in a downward swoop. It was synchornized BEAUTIFULLY. 

SUNDAY was the day of all days, and mum actually showed up. I had been up all night since they opened California Advenutre for everybody to line up in, and that became one big Disney Fan party...but sunday was very cool. They had the rededication, free ""crack-laced"" cupcakes, and free golden mouse ears, and at 4:45, the most emotional moment of the day for more than just me, the replay of Walt's speech, followed by the little video they played afterwards on all the jumbotrons that just ripped people apart. However, that weekend, DL probably got more money out of me at the Tiki Bar than anywhere else. I don't know why...but it did...and speaking of bars, here comes part 2:

Thursday July 21st, was my big 21. Originally, I was gonna be in DL until wednesday, and then proceed to Vegas from there, but that fell through. Damn school... so in August. But instead a few of my good friends from the dorm here, took me to the Cheesecake Factory and the bar there too...and then after that delectable meal (Rum and Coke, shrimp in angel hair, fresh strawberry cheesecake, and White Zin) we went over to Sarah's apt. and I bought some vodka, and we had screwdrivers until we were all a little screwy, coming back to the dorm I fell down some stairs. ""OH well, I meant have a cheese doodle but whatever it's a PARTY!"" Now not much occured last night...but why is it that we are all greatly amused by the elevators in the westin?! Those things are just so damn fun! So for now LJ, i'm taking off to go to the square and play in the elevators...TAh!

In one week I will be in gorgeous Anahiem for the 50th Anniversary of the BIG DL....sorry Sarah that I'm missing your 21st for that... 
Of course, the 50th is on a SUNDAY so I will be there ALL Weekend, and saturday night, rumor has it that they are expecting 12,000 Campers to be there for Sunday's events...I wholly plan on being one of them.

"event","But more importantly...HOW THE HELL DID I BURN A HOT POCKET?!? Further reason why I should stay the fuck away from the kitchen. Seriously, the whole 4th floor smelled like burnt hot pocket. Let me explain, it wasn't fully frozen...and i popped it in for the required 2 minutes...put that damn shiny cardboard shit on but it wasn't centered...the next thing i know, the damn corner of the hot pocket is in flames. (and by ""UP IN FLAMES"" i mean something less than that of a candle.)

Anyway, about that subject line...so I've been playing on my new guitar that I got from work. But since I haven't had proper guitar lessons (or any lessons for that matter, self taught, etc.) I find myself mostly putting on acoustic music, like say, Extreme's ""More than words"" and just strumming along singing with my tone deaf voice. Thank god I'm one of only 4 left in the building. At least someone I'm sorta friends with stayed this long too...just one...poor guy is bored out of his mind though. Thank god I have a job or I'd be right there with him. 

And for those up in oregon, we've already been over this, but I wont be returning for this summer. I may come up for a weekend or something, but that's doubtful as most of my money will go to visiting certain animated rodents and certain magical kingdoms who may be celebrating certain golden anniversaries with a spectacular fireworks show i've already downloaded the music to. AWESOME. As well as the new Space Mountain soundtrack which is currently ""unreleased"" but...OOPS! They released it! So i have it now! That won't open til the day I get there though. Long lines....yet so worth it. and then also in July, we have the great grand and glorious 21 on 21! HOO-RAH! 

And I busted the fuck out of my wrist punching the fuck out of a punching bag earlier. So it kinda hurts to type my pointless rants...away I go! But first, some more lyrics! Thanks Harry Connick Jr.!!
Must you dance....
every dance...
with the same...
fortunate man?

Yooouuu have danced with him since the music began
why don't you
change partners and
dance with me?

Must you stand...
quite so close...
with your lips touching his face?

Can't you see, I'm longing to be 
in his place
Why don't you change partners and dance with me?

You've been in his arms ever since heaven knows when?
Why don't you change partners, and then,
you may never want to change partners again!

"event","Just because this quote randomly plays in my head throughout everyday since the day I saw the film, I must once again throw it out for others:

""And for that one week, that one little blip of my existance....I was happy"" - Arthur Dent, referring to Tricia McMillan in ""Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy""

Note ..1. I REALLY wanted to go to Waterworld today too... originally I was going to for work, but with the format change, that fell through but then I wanted to go for fun and tan my pale ass (not the body part, just myself as a whole (no pun intended). You see, Oregon for the last few years has turned me into a creepy looking italian/hispanic with Irish-like skin. That, and they opened this crazy-as-fuck looking new slide called ""The Tornado."" But why I didn't go lies in the fact that nobody is here anymore, they have all left, my roommate was moving stuff into storage, and I slept in too late to go across the bay to pick any friends from there up and then go out to concord and still have a full day of fun.

Note ..2. It's funny how one can gain an entirely new perspective on something that happened months ago through a new friend who is on the phone arguing with her boyfriend but everything coming out of her mouth sounds exactly the same as it did with you once and you start having little flashbacks of almost an axactly similar situation, but now you see it from a whole other angle and you can actually see the look on her face, and the words sound the same coming out, but the face is showing practical tears and utter pain. And then you think back to your situation from the past and you feel like absolute shit and without any hidden intent you want to write that one person back and apologize profusely for making that person feel like crap and putting them through all sorts of hell that they didn't deserve, yet recieved because of extreme misinterpretation. 

Note ..3. Note ..2 could be why i've been in my wierd mood lately since that happened last week.

Note ..4. Just a friendly reminder, I don't answer phone calls from blocked numbers so if you have one, LEAVE A MESSAGE! If you don't leave a message, and then you complain to me about not answering my phone or calling you back, THAT'S WHY! 

Note ..5. Despite how much I play it off, I am actually going to miss everyone that I have met here. Even my sleep-muttering, bathtub clogging, door-breaking, music battling, antenna messing, dvd misplacing, alcoholic roommate.

More Notes Later."

"event","Okay, so one Oregon trait of mine has stayed constant. Today, I ,ahem, missed class to take the day off since I didn't work today either. But just as it did in Oregon, my boredom and relaxation set in, and then quickly, almost faster than normal, turned into a mild bout of depression. I made a few phone calls to friends back home, hung out and caught up with the friends around here...watched a little tv, took a nap. Laughed a wee little bit...but mostly, I've gone back to this little droopy ole' me that seems like something from back in the oregon days. A part of me that I thought I got rid of. As I fix this condition, I will keep you posted....but for now, I leave you with an appropriate quote.

Judging by the fact im running on about 14 hours of sleep since friday, slept through my class this morning, and will be up til 2:00 tonight working on a project...

"event","Okay...the full version of that subject line reads as such:

""If you've had a wall hit you from the side, watched your gay friend (who may as well be an angry black woman) get in an argument with your roommate, and then chase after your own shoe as it floats away into San Francisco Bay...You're having the Best Week(End) EVER!""

Let's start from the beginning.

FRIDAY
EVeryone is psyched, our school and my roommate's ""fraternity"" is hosting this fashion show/semi-formal. Tons of fun. Problem though....advertised as ""open bar."" I knew this was going to be trouble. That morning at lunch we were talking about the drink, a screwdriver. And how if I and my non-drinking self were to drink anything it would probably be that. FLASH FORWARD to the party. Bar isnt as open as one thought. But alas... the alcohol is flowing. Whoa...here comes Adam...""I was bringing someone this screwdriver, but I can't find them now. You want it?""
I took it. I might as well try it. It's bound to happen sometime. I enjoyed it. I really did. Then...here comes some friends of mine with their drinks...""Want some tony?!"" They were quite astonished to see my former non-drinking self giving in. I tried it. One of these drinks happened to be Rum and Coke. I then went on to have two of those. Yeah....various sips of drinks continued. But I was standing around talking to Preston, and as I walked away, the wall came up from the right hand side and hit me. So I decided that was enough. I was still coherent and remember everything but it was awesome. I ended up leaving with some people (much to the surprise of a lot of people, including my roommate when he came home and I wasn't yet) but I can't go into detail there because I promised those people that I wouldn't.

SATURDAY
Not much happened on Saturday. During the day. Apparently I'm Todd's new receptionist because now that everyone has my number, and they know i live down the hall from phone-less todd, they put two and two together...
Anyway, later that night Todd and Michael came over and we watched some movies, including the Real Cancun(t)(tee-hee) Michael is still very angry at my roommate for some reason or another and decided to dump water all over him as he left. about 45 minutes later, Adam (my roommate) got him back. Worse. All we hear is screaming from the hallway. Michael runs back into my room, locks the door. Adam comes back pounding....let me in...seriously...TONY! so i had to give in. What followed was a 40 minute ""argument"" about how now his hair was all nappy, and his clothes were wet, and fingers were waving in the air....I was in absolute hysterics, I wish I had pictures and/or video.

SUNDAY
Todd, Michael, Sunny, and I all go down to what originally was planned as the beach, but we settle for this marina/grassy area near Fort Mason. Great views....so we're taking pictures down by the water, and I take my shoes off to dip in. FREEZING! I couldn't believe how cold that water is. No wonder those Alcatraz escapees are thought to be dead. After like 1 minute my feet were purple. We took the picture and I got out of the water. I was taking a picture of Todd and Michael and they start screaming...""Nooooo! YOUR SHOE!"" and then I hear Sunny laughing her ass off. I spin around real quick to see my shoe tumble into the water off the rocky edge. I'm panicking...for christ sake, I'm NOT walking back home with one shoe. I manuever around the rocks, and make my way into the water, I'm slippin a little, and end up going knee-deep. All I hear in the background is laughter, including my own. Then someone screams ""The Waves"". The waves came up deeper, closer. But as they pull away, my shoe goes out into the bay further and further. I do a rough calculation in my head as to where the waves will take it, and I move further down. FINALLY, I get my shoe the hell out of there. I did however, give up a sock to the San Francisco bay. It was one or the other, the sock was a poor little irish man on the titanic, and the shoe was kate winslet. Who to Save? But now, because of the splashing, and the waves, I was soaked in cold-as-fuck, SF Bay water that reeks...and the comforting thought of being covered in shark and whale sperm. But most importantly, that water is fucking FREEZING. and I am now covered in it. so now (having bathed in a superheated 30 minute shower session) I must deal with a sore throat, the embarassing pictures thay got(which will be up soon), and the ridicule as soon as this story passes around, and I don't care really. Because I will always cherish these three great college memories that spawned from this weekend. Now here's the cool thing...the boat party is this upcoming weekend....lets hope for a repeat! Well, not even that, but similar moments.

The name of Tony has made you serious-minded, responsible, and stable. You love the security of a home and family, you are fond of children, and, as a parent you would be fair and understanding. Although you have good business judgment, you are not aggressive in your dealings because you do not like to create issues. You would be successful in any position dealing with the public as you have a diplomatic and tactful manner and possess a charming, easy-going nature which puts people at ease. People are drawn to you because they feel that you are patient, kind, understanding, and responsive. You would be effective in a career or in volunteer work where you are handling people and serving in a humanitarian way. While you are honest and responsible, one weakness that is paramount in your life is your lack of self-confidence and initiative, which causes you to put things off and avoid facing issues. Generally speaking, you have few problems with your health; however, there is a weakness affecting the fluid functions of the body.

"event","ALERT: What follows is a rant that was made whilst in a highly stressed/anxious/depressed (near shaking) mood. Beware. 

So today I went across the bay. I was supposed to go to Santa Cruz but that fell through. So what I did was, I used the open slot in my Schedule to go hang out with two of my really good friends. So I take BART out there to go hang out and I'm walking from the station to their house. I see my dad driving down the street, so I wave. Two minutes later he calls me and asks what I'm doing there. I tell him to come visit but I didn't specify who. ""Well, you were coming to see me right?"" 
""No, I was gonna hang out with Matt and Bryan"", and that of course became a little bit of a thing. And it became a mini-lecture about calling people before I go. And I said that the people I was visiting (Matt and Bryan) knew that I was coming. But I would still go down there and say Hi. From that conversation on, it was a pretty good day. I went to Matt and Bryans, Bryan wasn't home at that moment, he was on his way home from Pleasanton, and Matt was in the shower so he didn't answer the door. So I went down to my grandparents house, figuring I would have to break in through one of the windows or the backdoor, but my uncle was there. So we hung out, and watched Best week ever.Anyway, pressing on to my point. I had a great day hanging out with my friends. But at about 9:00, Matt is taking me back to the BART Station, but I had to give something back to my grandma, so we stopped there. Dad was home, so I said Hi. I'm gonna skip the dialogue, but basically, it became a retarded-ass fight about how I come for money, when his ass VOLUNTEERED IT and then accused me of ASKING FOR IT and leaving. It was this huge fuckin' production. And It drove me nuts. Pressing on to my point.... It frustrated the hell out of me. Like, to a near tears point. I was on the BART train twitching and listening to my music trying to calm my ass down. But what I'm really getting at with this WHOLE post...is that My friends in OR warned me about this. They used lines like ""That's DANGEROUSLY close to your father"" and ""I still don't see why of all places you're going THERE. That's just gonna be a problem."" And on that BART train home tonight I thought about it. Why Am I here? There were a few reasons that popped up. ONE of them, like the main reason I chose this school in the fucking first place, No longer exists. So I sat there dwelling about how I put my own ass in this position for a reason I told myself I never would, and how I could be elsewhere (location-wise) doing the same damn thing. That made things slightly worse. Then I thought a little harder, tried to focus on the other reasons that I was here. And I basically settled on the fact that I need a job. BAD. I need something that will occupy all my free time, something that will also benefit me in someway (financially), and a fuckin' good reason that I can't make it out across the bay as much, even though I hardly get out there as it is. But then again, as soon as he figures out Im taking time off work and/or school (assuming it's in session) to go to certain rodent-based theme parks for certain golden anniversaries, that will start the whole damn broken record all over again. So we shall see how that pans out. But all in all, I must say this. Sorry to all my Oregon Friends. I'm sorry that I threw your advice out the window. A lot of you listen to me and what I think, but I totally disregarded what you had to say and I came down here anyway, and am now thrown into the EXACT situation that you all had predicted. I'm sorry. Perhaps in the future, if similar relocations near a potential stress-hazard occur, I will listen to you."

"event","I've always considered myself someone that one can easily talk to about problems. For years, a lot of friends have entrusted me with ""Vault-Worthy"" secrets. Why? Because I can keep them (most of the time), I dont judge them by their beliefs or thoughts and don't use what they tell me to my advantage, and in some situations, i might be able to offer advice. Respecting my unimpeachable traditions, I will re-tell this story but I wont mention names. Given, my word usage will probably narrow it down to a possibility of 4 or 5 different people, but there IS a reason as to why I'm bringing this up.

I was listening to my friend talk about a current issue he is having. Relationship issues. Now, this story seemed oddly familiar, only this time, I was playing a different character, ""The listener"". Tell me if this rings similar to any of you guys also, or if it's just me. My friend is telling me this story. He met a guy a little while ago, and now they ""are dating"" but he wants a little more than just that. Like something more committed. However, since they are just dating, they are not tied down. My friend then meets somebody else. Somebody who potentially is better. ""Guy ..2"" if you will. So there is now Semi-established guy ..1 who he wants more with but isn't getting, and there is guy ..2 who seems like all he wants. But he is torn. He is focusing on all the different aspects. However, these came into play: Personality, Flexibility, Career, Age, and Location. One is leaving for a different area, and the other is sticking around locally. So one would be a little more ""Convienent,"" but could also be the better candidate potentially. Now, things were said as he was juggling the two by one of the parties involved. Sarcastic and bitter things that he may/may not have meant. And now my friend is 98% sure of ditching the guy based on what he said. I felt bad cuz I just sat there laughing.
""What? Is this similar or something""
""Yes. Yes it is""
""Am I over-reacting""
""No. No you're not. In fact, it seems the common thing to do.""

(BANJO TWANG)
Why are there so many
Songs about rainbows,
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions
but only illusions
and rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
the lovers, the dreamers, and me
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
when wished on the morning star
somebody thought of that
and someone believed it
look what its done so far
what's all amazing that keeps us stargazing?
and what do we think we might see?
someday we'll find it
the rainbow connection,
the lovers, the dreamers and me
all of us under it's spell, we know that it's probably magic
have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
ive heard them calling my name.
is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailor?
The voice might be one in the same.
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
it's something that I'm supposed to be.
Someday we'll find it.
The rainbow connection.
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.

That was around midnight. I then called Sarah, she texted me with a slight annoyance she was dealing with...again. So I called her and was on the phone for like 1.5 - 2 hours. I miss my sarah. It's kinda sad, especially since I've been getting slight doses of lack-of-oregon sickness (I refuse to say ""home-sickness"") Like earlier tonight, I wanted to go get ice cream, but couldn't. A. because it's mugging hour and I'm by myself. B. I didn't really feel like walking anywhere. and C. I didn't have anyone to go with. I started to miss sarah too because we would go get ice cream when we were bored. I also started to miss emily a little, and our late night drives to nowhere, and coffee stops at Dutch Bros. (Milky Way!) 

But at the same time, I've been enjoying what I do (when I do things) immensely here. Like today, Bryan came out here and we went to Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Great Lunch. I found a T-shirt that I need to buy Giedre. When I have the fundage to do so that is. I'm looking up at my pictures right now and starting to miss Cody-roy also. ""Doodles"", ""Codes"", ""Coda-rel"". Whatever nickname I use, they all point to that same little kid. The little pest who I miss asking me to borrow movies already. Or If I want to play monopoly. Or Disney Scene-It. (He's the only person to beat me on that game too. (it was a question about a Direct To Video Sequel and we all know I hate those)) 

And then, people are frustrating! Which doesnt help much. But that's a story a few of you know. On to something else, Today Adam bought a new TV, and I drew all over the box. Which, we now live in the ghetto, and are using the box as a temporary stand for it. With a nice big picture of what could be me hanging himself because of a lack of cable, which we're looking into getting tomorrow actually because we found out, we might could get it installed here. I suppose that's all for now. More later."

""Tradition is the illusion of permanence""

""All people know the same truth, our lives consist of how we choose to distort it""

Both of these said by Harry Block (Woody Allen), in ""Deconstructing Harry""

And speaking of quotes, poor Adam (my roommate), he wanted to watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I'm saying key lines along with the film. Could be worse I guess...Could be a ""bunch of talking lions"" that we're watching. God knows, and most of you do too, that that movie gets that treatment the worst.

Now just for kicks, sometimes I watch the movie that the day shows. So today, I watched A bug's life. I got into it as usual...and about 15 minutes in there is a scene that is highly symbolic to me. It plays like this: Flik, the creative little inventor ant who is the main character (and who I've tested as as my character from this movie) of course is accident proned (another strinkingly similar trait) knocks over the offering. Hopper (the big bad villain) comes down into the ant hill, and picks up Dot, (the cute little princess ant) and Flik stands up to Hopper.
Flik- ""Let her go!""
Hopper holds out Dot with one hand and with a very sinister voice says ""You want her? TAKE HER.""
Flik backs down cowardly because he lacks the confidence and the self-esteem to partake in a battle he knows he won't win.
I never really liked that scene, and now it's just a wee bit harder to watch.
But on the brighter side, Flik does stand up to Hopper at the end...and wins. Me and my underdog stories...

Also, today when I wasn't slothing around, I walked all the way to Fisherman's Wharf and was planning on eating at In and Out...when I got the temptation to walk to Pier 39 and go to the Boudin (sourdough bread) store and got the most awesome Tuna sandwich. But note to self, these are high tourist areas, and with a lot of unnescessary foot traffic comes the tourist prices...and NEVER have I seen more Human Robots in my life. The first two were cool, but the others were just annoying...I spent about 3 hours out and about and came back and fell asleep on the horribly uncomfortable couch that killed my TV, and awoke to my new roommate coming in. He's pretty cool. But tomorrow I have to go to the store, and get a little bit o the Liquid Plumr...two hairy gents...that drain doesn't stand a chance! Anyway, I'm gonna get back to Dodgeball..(another underdog story)...damn no cable...(the twitching has begun!!)"

"event","Being here, and just my general attitude has totally reminded me of the different Tony personalities that exist within myself, and also the whole joke someone said earlier about ""A whole new me"" I've decided to throw this out there. Here are the different Tonys, within one Tony, me.

California Tony - What once started as the shy guy in the corner became the mingler who moved to oregon. The social skills still there, can just hang out and not worry about a damn thing. Can be sweet, kind, but also slightly tempermental. This tony is the most likely to begin drinking with his oldest friends in the world, sadly, contrary to that, probably wont because of a maturity instilled in him by hanging out with other people at one point not at all like them. This Tony is also the most logistical and wisest, and for some reason, almost more confident than the others, but knocked away by a Tony that will be mentioned a little later.

Oregon Tony - Bitter, asshole, conspiracy theorist, ""everybody is out to get me"" attitude . Reclusive, had to be summoned out...yet still showed signs of goofball, and worry-free-ness. However, this Tony is the most Evil, Selfish and Cunning. Once conned a french teacher into taking him and several others to Disney World for 5 days for a three hour program that didn't even teach anything about france. Always pessimistic, and sarcastic (though these qualities still exist in the others) and rarely balled up to doing anything. Sadly, this is the Tony that most reading here know.

Disney Resort Tony - By far the best of the Tonys. Once called by someone who went on the aforementioned trip to florida ""the sweetest and nicest guy you'll ever meet."" The Generous, caring about others attitude...""I'm here for you not for me"" kind of thinking. Confidence is sky-high, as he dances in parades and willingly volunteers for performances in shows and what not. Very educated in the area, can spit out the most useless but somewhat needing-to-know trivia out there. But be careful, this is the most touchy-feely Tony of them all. From grabbing your shoulders to guide you around, all the way to group hugs in front of the tower of terror...this tony shows the most affection. Sadly, only a select few have seen this Tony in full-force. 

Given, each of these main Tonys has their own sub-categories, but this is the general jist. And now, that i'm back in California, and haven't felt like shit since I've been here, and surrounded by others like me, it looks like we're gonna land a great combination of California Tony and Disney Resort Tony, and possibly spawn the greatest Tony of them all, the AAU Tony!"

I look out my window and he's shouting up to the top floor of the building on the corner. I'm watching, when it dawns on me...If i really want to hear what the guy is saying, I'll open my window. So I open my window. He was screaming this woman's name...I don't recall what it was, you'd think I would. But he was screaming her name ""Stella"" style. It was hilarious...then the traffic came. He parked in a lane of a three laned one way road. Hazard lights on and everything. Screaming! Finally the light in this apartment turned on and the girl, pretty cute from the distance away I was looks out and starts screaming back ""What do you want!?"" and she appeared very angry. I just wish it were raining, that way I could blast my music out the windows...

""I dont mind spending every day out on your corner in the pouring rain!"" Except the lyrics would have to be changed to ""Scream at my window, stand near my door"" It was quite entertaining, lets see how the rest of the nights go.

OH, and also. My building (Pine) is apparently in some kind of which is better war with Sutter. Anywho, it has been decided that in a FIGHT FIGHT Pine would win, because everyone is in better shape because of the hills. However, Pine is all male (another key in the FIght fight) and Sutter is co-ed. So it has been decided, and I agree, that Sutter is better, simply because it has more boobs. Now if you'll excuseme, I must get back to watching the street corner and playing the appropriate music....for I am boobless and cable televisionless."

Luckily though, my roommate had one he left here, so Im using that one for now. BUT THERE IS NO CABLE! AND THEY WONT LET ME GET CABLE!! Death will occur at some point by may. Guaranteed.

But I've managed to occupy my time. Either I snoop around the building like the little nut job that I am...or I go out and about. I've been walking around the city, today I went to Chinatown and the financial district, and tomorrow, I'm going to Union Square and the Metreon...all of these walking distance. Yesterday, Bryan came out here for dinner, and we went to Rainforest Cafe, which has unofficially become my replacement for the Red Robin back in Eugene. But I may go hang out and about in the wharf area again tomorrow as well. I don't know.

I love my new home. The building is awesome, and the room is so much more than what I have expected. Its not a little closet like all the other dorms i've been in. The only problem is that it utilizes a bunk bed. HOWEVER. Where it lacks in sleeping comfort, it excels in spacious luxury. We have a little couch, entertainment center, two desks...shelves, and...the private bathroom. The room itself is like 14 x 16 feet, with a four foot by six foot bathroom with shower and the works. Pictures later! and more later too! I'm going to go back to watching re-runs of Drew Carey on broadcast television....oy. I may actually MEET people tomorrow too. who knows."

With the fact that I will be leaving Bore-gon within the next 36 hours, and will be awake for the next straight 24, and packing my computer up in a few hours and being on the road, and a combination of other things along with getting settled at the new place and doing other things, will more than likely keep me from updating for a while.

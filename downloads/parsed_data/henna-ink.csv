"event","my sister walked in on me staring at the mirror again.  she disapproves but i like watching myself cry.  i cry wicked hard forcin it until i laugh at myself and laugh at how like sad ive become.  pointing at the reflection in the mirror i can pretend that this pitiful lil kitty kat isnt me.  and when i slowly lower my hand i kinda like feel guilty and happy at the same time.  i like the way black trails flow from my eyes down to my chin.  i wipe them away with a proud smile not knowin if thats fake too and become pleasant for my papa and future husband.  its an homage to my given name.  ink the girl of mystery.  and its so sad when life's only haven is fantasy.  my sis is softer than i am cuz she cries by seein other people cry.  but i dont blame her cuz i used to be like that.  as a lil girl i once caught my mama cryin while papa and her was separated.  so it like makes me feel uncomfortable when sis does shit like that.  i dont want to create another ink.  shes too into the fantasy as it is especially after i allowed her to be my date to the banquet ceremony.  when all her heroes and villains came to life shes been convinced that this was for her too.  so to spare her the same unhappiness i have i have to set a good example.  smile for papa.  do what they want.  trust that they know whats right cuz they've like been through the same thing right?  i wanna smash that mirror."

"event","i told her not to touch the kid.  i hugged the lil kid when bitch face came up to me but our number one got in the way.  i knew this was a gift to her.  the baby's mama was like a 16 yr old girlfriend of a thug who was like mainly involved in that showdown where noons boo died.  2 yrs later our enforcer gave her payback served cold like he promised. givin her this was like washin his hands clean.  he liked clean hands or he liked to think his hands was clean.   
noon said the girl werent no mama.  these animals werent no people.  she said the kid i had in my hands was just like nother monster wholl like grow up and kill more good people like her boo.  girl is wicked ugly cause she feel nothin for people.  she never talk to me cause she hates my guts.  i still feel that kid shaking back when i listened to noons pain.  kid was so quiet it was creepy.  im not confused like that a lot but i held that kid afraid of what noon will do to im.
but our big sister was thinking of somethin else.  a real monster was comin in to finish up.  we was just girls using our innocent front to get through tha door.  sandal comes first then red pole.  this red pole was badass and brutal.  he likes blood specially his own.  he likes fights where he got hurt.  people who like pain are brain damaged.  he was like dat but he liked inflicting pain as much as he done received it.  
his name was ah and he was born with our number one and our enforcer together.  they was triplets in our big family.  but he werent no big brother to us.  he was a monster on our side and even though he on our side we was still wicked freaked out by him.  number one made noon shut up cause we had to like leave before the red pole came to finish the job wait for the viet thug to come back for his booty call.  number one hated the red pole as much as i hated noon.
but noon done complained too long and the red pole came with his crew.  he laughs like a dying sick man like he was gasping his last breath.  the other girls ran out the door and i tried leavin with the boy but the mama done started cryin out for her son.  the red poles claws got on my shoulder and dug into my skin.  noon came up to us and like i thought she was comin to protect me.  But she was just tryin to get on the poles good side and get the boy but the red pole done thought the same things as me.  he grabbed her face at the jaw and dug his nails in her skin too.  he said we was both weak cause we were bein like mamas protectin the young.  one of his boys took the kid and the red pole shoved us out.  he pointed his bloody fingertip at number one tellin us we better leave or he'll beat us too in a moment.  we ran like the wind.  noon didnt bother wipin the blood off er cheek.
we jump in our getaway brown minivan.  our driver was our enforcer and big brother.  they call him fan cause back in the day in china the smart nerds always done held gay feather fans.  jaster was as crazy as he was smart.  he lied good cause his memory was sharp.  he controlled peoples minds cause he was control freak.  he got what he wanted cause he was good with talkin to people.  after every job he always liked to talk and be all mystic cause he liked star trek.  
when we came in the brown mini noon and number one sat in the front whiles me, flower and ecstasy was in the back seats.  number one told jaster bout me and the kid.  he smiled and said you cant save the world by helpin people one at a time.  but he said my heart was in the right.  jaster then popped in a tape to play music cause he liked pretendin he was in the movies.  song was like this stupid 2 live crew song called hoochie mama.  he fumbled with the dials and said it wasnt the effect he was lookin for.  we all done laughed at him.  hes a goofy nigga too.  noon coyishly took his hand and rubbed it on her cheek thankin him for the gift.  i watched his dirty red hand on the steering wheel all the way back to school.  he thought it was clean."

"event","big sisters werent anything new to me at my teens.  i done learned how to make myself up by a sister.  i done learned like how to shoplift clothes from the mall from a sister.  i learned how to use my body to make ends meet from a sister.  how to snort coke and hustle.  i learned how to steal and how to punch n kick.  but there was this one sister who werent the same from the others.  friends called her number one cause she was the oldest and only one outta twelve who done got formally initiated.  the bad guys called her sandals cause she was the bosses messenger.  there was one point in my life when i called her mama. 
its good to know where these people come from before the story gets hot.  a writers gotta like add personal stuff into each player so that you like feel for them later.  this girl named number one, she one of the few that get out of the story aight but at the same time shes like one of the most saddest players in my story.  she aint used and abused like the others but shes hurtin throughout cause of obligation.  i know cause i was tight with her lil sis.
korean families, they all about the siblings being tight and shit.  anyone who knows any like korean person done heard their words for brothers and sisters.  our number one and her sister werent nothing like that.  this is cause their parents were like musical hippies and tried hard not to match with those korean traditions they have.  sad to say they done never mixed well.  they was like oil and water. 
they was always  fighting in front of everyone like no tomorrow.  we knew how things would end cause we done heard number one say it over and over again.  shes like 'i'll get off your case when you grow up'.  the sister would spit 'i hate you' and then people all split up.  its mad tense when family fight in public.  you dont know what to do with yourself while its happening and you cant run away.
number one like over did it with her motherly instincts prolly cause her mama didnt fit the description of what other mothers was like.  so when her lil sis got the whole school club in debt with bad men her insticts went on overload.  if she wasnt a woman she woulda been the one who stepped up to the boss and asked for our money back.  she likes the younger girls relyin on her cause its the respect her sister never gave.  thats part of the motive behind her character.  the other motive was more personal and embarrassin.
number one was the first to die inside cause of her like wicked retarded ways of copin with stress.  she was the first to get all cold.  it was her idea to leave noon alone with the dead boyfriend cause life was too short to lace it with unimportant problems.  but even though she was like dead inside therell sometimes be clues to a ghost of what she used to be before she was number one.  durin tense times you feel that motherly warmth in her eyes when she ask if you aight or when she doesnt want us to take a job.
those eyes are deep like a cat.  and if you looked hard enough you can get stronger from it.  thats our big sister.  our number one."

"event","we begin with what we writers call character foil.  foils is like mirrors to other peoples.  in this story, she reflects me and ten other girls.  we were twelve altogther.  but this one always done pissed me off not just cuz i saw the worst in me through her.  nah it's just i didnt like bitch face.  end of that.  by the way, i'm ink.  nice to meet you.
not all of us have tragedy laced into our past.  only the interesting ones do.  i wasnt there when my foil had her bad day.  but when i hear about it, even though we hate each other i still feel for her.  to understand youve got to like picture in your head the first time someone made you feel beautiful.  you got to like think of that day when you didnt care what tomorrow was all about cuz you was so into today with that somebody.  and if you never been in love try picturing a relative you love and respect who you run to when the worlds all fucked up.  
then you have to like suddenly take all that good away and tear your heart out while youre at it.  take away the light of day forever.  pretend you know what its like to go blind permanently.  you know like the worst possible thing imaginable when everythings perfect.
she lost her boyfriend of one week in a fight.  i heard the first date was in this pizza restaurant  they stayed there from five in the afternoon till closing even though they finished their meal at like six.  she aint the prettiest girl in school.  she was super soccer player cuz she was chinese and asian girls dont like join sports teams less they was good.  her mistake was joining an asian club to help boost her college application.
that night after the fight there was pandemonium in the car while she was cradlin her boyfriend in her arms.  from what i heard she was repeating words he done said to her that night in the pizza shop.  you got beautiful eyes.  your amazing.  i wanna be your boyfriend.  she was crying and tellin her dead boyfriend all those sweet words that meant the world to her.  when they hit the hospital she was all quiet.  they done left her on the bench with her boy and our enforcer done told her a story to tell the hospital and police in case they cared.  she agreed under one condition.  girl was brain damaged after that.  but they like them like that where we come from.
one of our sisters done told me what it was like to drive away from her and watching her and her boyfriend fading away from view.  we dont know what happened after that.  there was police who said it was gang wars then she had to do all this paper work and do that line up deal.  after two weeks the police done told her that they'd get to her when they find the people who fit the description she gave.  she took time off school after that.
when she came back the school saw her happy and normal again.  she looked happier than before.  her grades was still high.  she still was soccer queen.  but rumors had it that she was high on something.  other rumors said she was running with bad crowds after school.  who knows?    point is even though she looked back to normal she was more fucked up than before.
why am i writing this part?  because this is the only sympathy you'll have for her in this story.  in later episodes you'll see her spit on my face.  bust my lip.  beat up my boyfriends.  get me in trouble with cops and gangsters.  you'll see her abandon me on purpose.  see her turn my friends against me.  youll even hear her tell our enforcer to leave me for dead when my neck done got cut.  but when you hear this i want you to remember there was a time when she wasnt bitch face.  she was that girl fading into the distance under a street lamp when her friends left her alone with her dead boyfriend.
the only reason i dont respond to her abuse by mocking what her boyfriend said to her on their first date is that i'm different from her.  shes a foil but the reflection in the mirror is what i could be.  not all of us have tragedy in our past.  only the interesting ones.  

the girl named Noon."

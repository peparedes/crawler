"event","so i actually dont really know what this thingy is about, jen said its a good way to keep in touch -so here i am  *g*

I just hope to get back in touch with some of y'all.

So I guess I gotta tell ya whats going on in my life at the moment... Some of yall probably know that I am majoring in medical sciences. Were having our first state exam on thursday. around 45 percent of all students fail- I am so nervous about it.  At first I was intending to take the exam in march but my boyfriend  has to take it now so we decided to give it a try.  If we fail (which is pretty likely )we can retake it twice so it aint that bad. (but still depressing I guess...)

The test is for the basic studies of the medical sciences (anatomy ,physiology, biochemistry, biology, physics, chemistry,psychology )we get 360 multiple choice questions and we got an oral exam in anatomy, biochemistry and physiology...
We'll see what comes out of it I just wish I could fall asleep and skip the next three weeks ...lol

Talk to ya soon:)"

"event","i don't know...livejournal is really messed up and i think i broke it...anyway, today was ok...nothing too cool happened at work today...it was average...it was ok though i got to talk to my favorite counselor again from boys club...we usually talk when i'm up in second chair, which maybe isn't the best time, but there were no kids in the water and he is cool, so i don't mind...i don't know why but before i started going through my top drawer, the one where i keep all my cool stuff...i seriously have stuff in there from 6th grade all the way up through june of this year...it was just crazy because i have all these notes from people...and i found a picture of brian sovyrda, the former love of my life...i know it is very cheesy but the few times i have seen him when he is home from school, i get the biggest butterflies in my stomach and i guess i will never get over him...what a STUD hahaha anyway, i found the funniest book--it is called the art of kissing or something like that...it's so weird because there were some things in there that i actually do that i didn't realize i had read...i know i am a freak..a SUPER freak...oh yeah even though this has nothing to do with what i was just saying, last night i got up on a table at work and danced to hott stuff and was messing around with my towel for my love samber and today sammy was like, heather everyone at the swim lanes was talking about the girl dancing on the tables and she told them it was me...one of the kids at practice started dancing saying ""i'm the girl on the table"" and sammy goes ""you mean heather?"" lol it's great...i totally forgot people on the other side of the lake could see me...oh well, it was still a lot of fun...but oh yes back to what i was talking about...so i was flipping through this cheesy book and it said something about feeling fireworks and i was like, hey i don't think i ever have! like there have been close calls i guess, but i don't know...the only thing close was with brian, and that was AGES ago...freshman year? everyone (i make it sound like SO many lol) else has just been like going through the motions...i think definitely the coolest thing would be a super-surpise-sneak-attack kiss...hahaha i feel like such a DORK saying all this but it is what's on my mind, so let's see...the super-surprise-sneak-attack kiss is awesome because it is like this EXPLOSION of feelings...you can just be goofing around and then you just happen to be looking at each other(you know, that crazy way) and WHAM someone makes the move...and obviously the other person was thinking the same thing, so it's SO crazy and hott and i don't even know what else..yes, that is the dream kiss...oh man now i am so embarrassed that i said all this but it's so true!!! i don't know, some people just go and hook up with kids and i'm like that's boring because there's no cool story to go with it...wow that sounds kind of weird, but if you know me, you know about me and my stories...everything is an adventure, and the super-surprise-sneak-attack is definitely a good story...who knows, i am probably the only cheesy person who thinks about these things lol...oh well, i'm going to bed early so i can go run around packanack early...word to yo motha"

"event","today was nice since i finally had a day off even though yesterday was so much fun...i don't know, yesterday was really cool but a few people weren't there so that's what probably helped a little...i felt like such a badass going to the library today...i know that sounds a little weird but let me explain...a long time ago i realized that they had cd's there and i checked out a few...around that same time i checked out a whole bunch of books for some reason as well...so i got into my car accident maybe a week before all of this stuff was due...if you don't already know, the accident was the week before memorial day weekend...so a few months pass, and i actually received notices about my outstanding book and cd fines...i finally returned the cd's today...i'm so scared to ask them how much i owe because then they'll look at me like i'm some kind of library criminal, and the women that work there are SO scary...work is going to be weird again tomorrow, so i'm getting a little nervous already...but i guess i'll have to tough...i don't know, i hate to dwell on it and chances are it probably wouldn't be so bad except that i think about it too much...i suck sometimes...oh well...my friend kim just called so i'm going over her house now...how funny is this--we both said let's have a we-look-scary-today-so-let's-just-stay-in-and-look-scary-together day lol...ooh here is something that was really cool...i just got a graduation card from matt shields today...what a great kid...he graduated when i was a freshman and when i see him i get so excited because i never met anyone who was so inspirational..it's hard to explain, but we always talk about sports (especially running and basketball) and helping people...i used to talk to his mom at the y all the time, but since we don't belong there anymore i haven't gotten a chance...so right now i have to go because kim will kill me if i am late...AGAIN lol"

"event","wow life can really change within a few hours...i got into my first ever real life fight and although i regret doing over the computer, i don't think i would have been able to handle it in person...as i said before, danny has been such a pain in the ass recently, and it really wasn't just him, but he can be the catalyst and the one who prolongs it, so i just lit into him...i've never done that before and at first it felt good...then he just went for it and said the meanest things i've ever heard...or read...anyway, it was this huge conversation, and things weren't left very good...i was just sitting that night sobbing, but lucky for me i have some amazing REAL friends who kind of cheered me up and helped me forget for a little while what a mess i had gotten myself into...i was dreading work on friday, and it was weird, yet not as bad as i thought; danny and i were talking, but things were OBVIOUSLY a little strange...so today, i was hoping things would at least be the same...but of course he and gina have to ignore me and just basically act like assholes...it's so depressing, like i was telling my best friend heather (yeah i know...two heathers...it's awesome!!!), these are, or were, people that i had SO much respect for and even before when they were being asses, i felt like i couldn't get mad...i had been picking up weird vibes from gina for awhile and of course danny has to follow along and be nice to my face (sort of) and the next second mutate into king asshole...i don't know, i guess i just got fed up with this kind of stuff, and i let loose...and looking back, it might not have been the most well-thought out thing i've ever done, but do i ever REALLY think things through? oh wait, that was one of his things---that i'm immature and that basically i am a jackass...i'm also selfish and grub for food all the time...and i spend all my time ""bopping in the water with five year olds""...i fought all of the above except the ""bopping,"" which personally i think is more fun than sitting around the office eating and complaining about life and talking about each person that's up in the chair...it's like you know whenever you're not around they're tearing you apart...my friends told me i have to stop worrying about what people think of me, but how hard is that?!?! it's like, you can't ever confide anything to anyone...nothing can be personal because the next second as soon as your back's turned, you're the laughing stock of the place...even riker has been such a jerk and everyday i want to quit because work just isn't fun anymore...it's weird, because i used to think danny and i were really close...and we were last summer...this summer started out a little weird, but we were still friends...i guess that was a little depressing too, because i know that he was the reason my summer was so much fun last year...i knew it...even from the first day, i noticed things were really different, but obviously i put that out of my mind...i said a little bit of this to him, and he said ""people grow, people change--if i didn't, i think there would be a problem"" (this was also following what an immature jackass i am)...i am so confused, because for the longest time, i used to hold everything in, like sometimes i just wanted to goof around but i never did, and i regretted it more than anything...and now i've finally learned to let go and not care...i have been having so much fun just doing my thing, and i'm told i'm a jackass...is there a happy medium? i just don't know...i also said i act like a jackass because that's what people expect, and that i can't ever say anything seriously without someone making a comment, and he said that it's my fault for allowing it...yeah, ok, but god forbid i ever tried to stick up for myself, i would be shot down SO fast, i can't even explain...the killer in this is that last year i was kind of on the rebound from these psycho girls who took advantage of me and all this junk happened, and last summer danny and gina were the ones who made me feel so good about myself...and now they're turning around and basically doing the same thing to me...i'm starting to think maybe it is me, and that i should just not talk anymore, so i'm out"

"event","<sigh> today was ultra-boring for the first 5 HOURS...i thought i was going to kill myself (or someone else lol)...i got so mad at danny because he always acts so superior to me and it makes me get all upset...but the weird part is that while i was sitting up in the chair, stewing over his meanness, i got less mad, so that by the time i saw him again, i couldn't say anything! it stinks because even though i hate to get mad at folks, sometimes they just need to hear me out and i never do it...what's the deal with that? oh well...by the way, HOLLA to lucas--IT'S NO FUN WITHOUT YOU!!!!!! if work were a cake, you are the icing-definitely the best part ;)...last night was funny, although not everyone likes to have fun...sometimes they act like they're 55 and just look at us like what the hell...but who cares? it is so much fun...skipping was the most fun, next to the poison movie candy...also on the way home, i was SO scared...i have NEVER gone so fast in my life down the highway...so badass...well, that IS me...i can't deny it..i think one of the hermit crabs is dead...and i feel very responsible for it...oh well, if anyone reads this, drop me a line...i am probably going to be around since i am banned from going out tonight...mom and pops are going golfing tomorrow morning early, so heather is trapped in the house tonight...that's ok, i'm actually kind of tired...because after the sucky part of the day, things got a little more fun at the lake...i was playing with all the kids, so that made me forget about all the bad stuff..yea kids!"

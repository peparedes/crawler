"event","So I come back from my night time activities around 2 AM and I find a fucking note on the board next to my door. See, the people in my room are Paul, Jesus, and Gabriel, so we drew a cross on our sign and decided to post a flyer for this movie called Jesus camp (which featured a crying child and the words ""America is being born again..."") on the board next to our door. So yeah, I find this note and it's some writing about ""please don't valdalize Jesus Camp with pagan words"" and other religious shit like that. What did I do? That's right, kids. I ripped it in half, let it fall to the floor, and stumbled drunkenly into my room.

And on another note, I'm sick of people saying shit like ""oh, you can have people take notes for you? Sweet! I wish I could have that!"" or ""Oh, I wish I had extra time on my exams! You're so lucky!"" Fuck you. Every last one of you mother fuckers. I'd gladly trade my accomodations for a chance to have a brain that worked normally. Fuck you and everything you stand for."

"event","That's right, Lacrosse totally DESTROYED Boy's Tennis today during lunch. We are advancing to the next round which takes place sometime next week, come cheer us on!

Didn't really do anything on Saturday and Sunday due to my Spanish project. But I presented on Monday and did a very good job according to Cervantes. No more thirty minute presentations in spanish for me. Monday was an interesting day, though. I went to the swim meet and from what I've heard, we won. That thing is so freaking confusing, I had no idea as to what was happening. I got to the meet and who did I happen to see? The other Paul! Many good times were had. We talked to Alison and Katie and some other people, but I forget most of their names with the exception of Henry because I almost attacked him in ninth grade for messing with my suit jacket. He seems like an OK guy now, though. However, I don't think he recognized me because he introduced himself to me (I had hair when that happened). And I let Scott borrow my suspenders for one of the most hilarious outifts I've seen in a long time. See either Alison or Katie's ljs for pictures. I learned a valuable lesson on Monday. I must admit though, I am still very amused that nobody noticed that I was puking on the bus. Not even Paul who woke me up two minutes prior to the event so I wouldn't miss my stop. I did manage to make it into my bag, though. But the bag broke when I was getting off the bus. So I left the bus leaving behind a deal of vomit, although the left leg of my jeans absorbed a bit. I'll have to go to another swim meet, t'was fun.

I honestly have no idea as to what happened on Tuesday.

Wednesday was our lacrosse game with Mira Costa. Not going to even touch that one. Asking the JV team to pass and catch is like asking a Southerner to speak Japanese. Varsity got raped too. Rusty and I wanted to hide in the grassy knoll and snipe their players with his BB gun. They were not making legal hits at all.

Today started off well. I got Evan and Paul to play some reggae in the car in the morning so the day was off to a good start. Then I headed
over to history which was, like always, odd yet fun. Alison didn't hit me today! Hurrah! And on another note, Natalie has an odd obsession with sparkly penises. And Sara is a freaking klepto. The three of them are so plotting against me. Then during lunch, we dominated in dodgeball. In English we started some odd movie in which this like eight year old girl beats the hell out of an eight year old boy with a broom and then they proceed to hit on each other."

"event","My Desmond Dekker LP got here today. It's a 1981 pressing off Trojan Records and is nothing short of orgasmic. Judge Dread's Big 6 and Big 7 45's are on their way as well, both are original pressings off of Bigshot. Paul is happy. Speaking of Desmond Dekker, who's up for his show at the Bluebeat Lounge in April? It could be the last chance that we'd have to see him. It's on a Tuesday, though.

Break has been nothing short of mind numbingly dull. I've been working myself to the bone with my damned Cervantes project and have yet to finish the essay. But hey, come next Thursday, I'll be free of his spanish hell.

Today was an interesting day. Woke up around 9:00 when my parents were leaving due to my Dad's medical needs. Started off the day quite well with a bit of King Tubby, Gregory Isaacs, and to top it off, a bit of Discipline (just to mix it up a bit). Wasn't in the mood to fix myself anything so I just heated up a hot pocket for myself around 11:30. Parents got back around noon I think. Dustin ended up calling and we started working out plans for Melrose on Friday. I have a list of records to pick up from Headline, none of which I've bought so far. Dustin also invited me to Magic's show on Saturday which is in Venice... at a church. Magic and his band playing at a church doesn't make for a good result, so I think I might just end up going. I need to haul ass on this project if I want to do that, though. If I ended up going to the show, I'd get to meet Crust Nugget who I keep hearing about from Dustin. Crust Nugget and Magic went vegan for some inane reason.

I need to contact Sean and Bryan, we have hanging out to do. I hear Sean has quite the reggae collection on vinyl and I must check it out. 

Who's up for a totally random night of madness?"

"event","Well, I wanted to see the one acts this weekend and bring Scarlett, but I didn't get a chance to because of lacrosse. I missed our game on Saturday due to SAT related reasons... In one week I'll be free of this vocab hell. Then I get to advance to Spanish hell! Hurrah! I'm actually going to miss 5th period tomorrow because I have to take a practice test (an entire four hours...). 

We need to get together after the SATs and do something! I need a night on the town desperately! I really hate being cooped up in my house all the time. I also found out that I'm going to miss Scarlett's show on the 11th due to SATs which was a real pain in the arse to hear because I missed her last show.

On another note, Desmond Dekker and Toots and the Maytals are coming to town soon, it's going to be orgasmic. While on the subject of music, I need to go to Amoeba sometime. Does anyone want to either give me a ride or tell me how to get there on the bus?

Oh, and we have a lacrosse game at Pali on Friday at 6:00 PM vs. Beverly Hills. So all of you kids who want to come should haul ass and check us out.

Finally, Wednesday's Wrap Party should kick major arse."

Edit:
I just watched Chapelle's Show because it's midnight and I'm bored out of my skull. My stance that it is once of the stupidest shows on television has been reinforced. Oh, and I'm going to slap the next person who says ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"""

"event","Well, I've finally decided to update. First off, lacrosse has finally kicked up. We've got practice inside of a gym tonight because of the rain, this should be interesting. I'd dislike it less if the times were more reasonable, but our practice times are as follows:
Mondays 8-10 PM
Wednesdays 8-10 PM
Fridays 6-8 PM
Quite the blast, eh? Sean and Bryan on the team seem to have taken quite the liking to the music that I'm into which is always fun. I'm progressing with guitar but I'm doing more reggae right now. Speaking of music, I need to take a trip to Amoeba and see if they've got some choice records in. Namely Judge Dread and perhaps some affordable Desmond Dekker, that would be grand.

I recieved my report card and I don't think I did half bad with the exception of Gunn who kind of screwed me over in more ways than one
H US history: A E E
Math Analy: C S E
Foods: A E E
Spanish 3A: A E E
H Am Lit: A E E
H Biology: A E E
So yeah, if it wasn't for that psychotic woman and I had actually tried in the class, I would have had straight E's and 5 A's and a B. That would've been my best report card yet. Oh well, I'm off to a good start in that class so far, got an A on our first quiz and I have another one tomorrow that should be pretty easy. I'm going to aim for straight A's this semester. That's going to be a real challenge though 'cause I've got Cervantes' project due right before the SATs. Surprisingly enough, she's actually considering postponing the presentations. I talked to her on Tuesday and she sounded like she might do it but I have to talk to her again tomorrow. Evan sqitched into my biology class from his AP class this semester which is cool.

I went to the show last Tuesday and hung out with Scarlett which was much fun. She eats so little, it's crazy I tell you! Originally, I was supposed to stay for the show. However, my mom forgot to reserve me a seat or something and problems developed. Plus, I got into a fight with the pops after I found out that they had (amazingly enough) found me a seat. He wanted me to go home, I wanted to stay. After quite the fuss, he agreed to let me return after the filming. It wasn't what I had planned, but it's better than nothing. Hung out with Scarlett for a bit more after the show then she left and I proceeded to play a bit of basketball with Jake and Shelby.

Friday night was spent at Jeff's house, good times there. As for Saturday, I seriously have no idea what I did. That kind of scares me. Sunday started off as just another dull day. I was going to go hang out with Jeff again, but he couldn't because of issues with his parents that arose. Ben called me up and told me about a ""kickback"" or sorts in Westwood. It was supposed to be Ben, Jack, Alex, and me. However, when I got to Ben's house at 9:00 PM, we were informed of new plans. We were meeting them at the place instead of the other guys coming to Ben's. Not only that, but there were about eleven other people who ended up coming. It took them like fifteen minutes to seat us because of how people were there and because we didn't have a reservation. They finally made room after about eight minutes and we took the four corner tables. We got four hookahs between the lot of us: apple, peach, rose, and strawberry. Oh, they brought out two huge platters of food too. The beef kabobs were freaking orgasmic. I knew they didn't card for hookah, but I didn't know that they didn't card for beer or vodka or anything of the like. Got myself a beer to start off. Alex ordered like five shots of vodka and I had one of those too. Alex got pretty smashed, he was poking random things with his fork and laughing. Oh, there was this totally random scary blonde chick who was dancing behind our tables. She was totally smashed. For quite some time, she was dancing by herself behind us. She even fell in Ben's lap at one point. After the open display of drunkeness, she tried getting the guys from our group to dance with her but nobody did because she was well... scary. By like 11:30, I'd had my share of beers, vodka, and pina colada. I don't intend to smoke hookah while drinking like that again though, because it really didn't rest well with me. I ended up puking in the bathroom and got a tiny bit on my boots which really sucked. The next ten minutes of my time were spent cleaning them. So yeah, after they were clean I rejoined the party and continued with the good times. By about 12:15 people were starting to leave so Ben and I decided to take off. We left our share of cash with Alex to pay the check and Ben drove us home. I woke up with no hangover. To this day I've never had one, it's awesome. Paul couldn't make it to the shindig though, so that sucked. 

I woke up at like 1:30 PM on Monday and proceeded to do a three and a half hour practice SAT which devoured most of my day. Other then that, I didn't do anything on Monday. Twas no lacrosse practice due to rain.

Yesterday: did nothing.

Today started off in a weird way. I met up with Paul in town like I usually do, but Adam was with him today. We had to run to Savon and pick up a poster board for my history class because we had that ""roaring 20's"" poster to make. Thanks to Alison for cutting our board into the cross shape because Adam, Sam, and I have no skills in making a proportional thing like a cross. Now I sit here in anticipation of lacrosse practice. On an ending note, I will post this little thingy that I stole from Rebecca and Alison. Oh, hurrah for a new background, too.

"event","I just finished reading The Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible. Twas very good in my opinion. I've got Skinhead Nation waiting to be read among other things. I've been reading quite a bit recently. The person that I got the two books from threw in Oi! The Video, a two VHS movie on Oi! It has a number of clips of bands such as Angelic Upstarts, Cockney Rejects, The Toy Dolls, The Business, Cock Sparrer, The Oppressed, Sham 69, Peter and the Test Tube Babies, Blitz, 4 Skins, Warriors, Argy Bargy, and Condemned 84 to name a few.

Tomorrow I shal be heading to the set because I'm still on break... not for long though. It'll be a good time for sure. I'll get to see Scarlett and everyone else. However, I'm not in the mood to walk to the set 'cause it's a ways away. So, I'm leaving at 9:00 with my mom and will proceed to sleep in the car for an hour or so til I'm ready to face the world.

I got pictures from Jeff's play back, he looks like a fucking zombie haha. Twas a good play, though.

When I last went to headline, I picked up a number of records, one of which is the Agnostic Front/Discipline 2 LP split (which came with a poster, score!) and I've nothing short of fallen in love with it. 29 tracks total makes for a happy Paul. The other record that I recently picked up that I've really taken to is the Combat 84/Last Resort split LP. Got it for a killer price, too. Instead of headline, I'm heading to Amoeba for my next record buying spree. I need to stock up on some reggae. I want to see if they pack any King Tubby or Desmond Dekker, that'd be fucking great. 

I think Dmitriy's going to visit on Monday, that'll most certainly be a good time. Speaking of the 'ol bastard, we still need to work out our plans for the Agnostic Front show on the 16th and the Angel City Outcasts show at the Cobalt later this month. 

I was taking out the garbage a few nights ago, and when I went to sit down afterwards, I noticed that my leg was itching. Naturally, I scratched it, but I felt the skin like... peel back beneath my fingers. So I looked at my hand and it was drenched in blood. My leg was also drenched in blood. There was a very large (about 3 1/2 inches long) and deep cut there, so I decided to go clean up. naturally, I got a picture with the cut. I mean how often do you find something like that? I bandaged it up and now it's pretty much stopped bleeding. I later found out that my dad stupidly threw some broken class into the trash which I had taken out.

In conclusion, nerd innuendos are fun."

Half of us are scratchin' our arses, the other half are slaves to work

Society is still insane

I'm spiking up my hair again
Society is still insane

A gross, a gross of empty promises echo through my ears
They're building me a brand new factory just to calm my fears
And all the King's horses and all the King's men
And all the King's horses and all the King's men
And all the King's horses and all the King's men
Shut the fucking thing again"

"event","Mmmmm New Year's festivities... Managed to locate more Purgen which is freaking orgasmic. I'm also sending away for a few Templars LPs, I contacted the band and apparently they have some left. Tis kickass. Finally got my Klasse Kriminal LP (I Ragazzi Sono Innocenti) and holy fuck... it's incredible. I missed the ACO show, but they're playing again in late January. Agnostic Front is also playing in early January. I also contacted Discipline, they're doing a US tour in 2005, fucking awesome. Anyone want to buy me a ticket to Berlin and perhaps come with me?

I would kill to be at that show. I've got nothing planned over winter break so if anyone wants to do anything, let me know. 

I can't think of anything to ask for for Christmas, this blows. 

I will be baking a yule log cake tomorrow.

It would also be a big help if someone could tell me about a place that puts pictures on boxers."

"event","Might go to New York with Lauren to visit Sarah. That will be quite the trip. Rissy's coming out to LA during the summer! I was at the Christmas party for the show tonight, the other Paul called me so out of the blue, I invited him to come hang out at the party and he was able to make it for an hour or so. He had to jet back home though because his ""parents"" returned earlier than they were supposed to. Twas a good time for all. Making ""holiday"" cookies in foods tomorrow. Fuck yea. In other news, Dmitriy might be sent off to rehab! The fucker got caught with coke at his school or something.

since this is a livejournal, the following will be my obligatory sentence about how my life sucks and how i'm always misunderstood: my life sucks, i cry myself to sleep and nobody understands me.

Huzzah for the ACO concert in two weeks.

All of you must read Dante's Infero or else I will hunt you down.

Have a nice evening, droogs."

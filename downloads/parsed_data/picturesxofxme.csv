"event","so far ive been working here for about a month now and i really enjoy it. now that i have the work life down, im just working on the social life. i go out about every weekend but not to party and shit. i just go out with a friend and chill. if im not OUT with one friend, im IN with another. thats pretty much what i do. im not down with the whole going to TJ thing and parting. it was fun, but i think i wanna keep it a rare thing. 

as for as my love life goes, its pretty much exactly where i want it to be. im at an understanding with a certain person and my head is clear. im enjoying the time i spend with the special people in my life and when im ready to settle down, then i will. its nice knowing i have an ungarenteed garentee...if that makes any sense to you guys. 

my plans for the rest of the year are to just work as hard as i can to save up as much money as i can. i wanna start going to school in january so that means ill have to drop my part time job. which is no big deal seeing as how they dont pay me enough to work there anyway. im at ease knowing my life is pretty much sailing along, but i dont want to say that cuz when you acknowledge something good, something bad comes along and screws it up. so ill always keep that thought in the back of my head."

"event","yesterday was a very surreal day for me. 

i saw many people who i hadnt seen in almost a year. 

the first was my freind chris. the last time i saw him was back in Februaruy at party.

when i saw him i was so happy. i miss my little fag.

the others were baically my ex-boyfreinds entire family.

it was his mom, little brother, his girlfriend, sarah, his little sister kristina, and joe and lisa. 

these people were like my family for about a year. i love them so much and i was so happy when i saw them. especially kristina and joe. 

the only sad part was that they were only there for a few hours. it was *poof* theyre here and *poof*poof* theyre gone. 

i miss that part of my life so much. i miss being really happy and just going up there and have the time of life everytime. 

it sucks now cuz all i can think about is what i used to have compared to what i have now. 

comparing is so wrong so i wont do it.

i was happy then, now im just confused.

not unhappy, just confused.

To get back to me</b> 

<i><b>I will wait for you forever 
If you would just ask me

Holding someone elses hand</i>
Together on phone lines 
And living at two opposite ends 

<b>It <i>scares</i> me to think that you could find takers 
Other than me and better than me</b> 
But your head is elsewhere 
And I'm talking enough for both of us 
When will you see it's not so easy for me 

<i>You're careless and whispered 
Insulting and bruising 
And I thought that you said 
Things were improving</i>
These laces are untied 
But my feet are still walking away 
Away...

 for you, for you 
I stay up nights [<i>If you are still pretending this is what's right</i>] 
Until stars leave the sky [Why can't you look at me can you only see] 
Knowing what my dreams can take away [Sides, your side, can]
take away

other times i feel that if i get too comfertable then it will all crash down as its done before.

but we always seems to rebuild it. 

just when i think that we've hit rock bottom you make a stupid joke and i cant stay mad at you.

i fucking hate that.

but i fucking love it too.

no one has ever made me so confused before in my entire life.

everything was black&white befrore i met you.

but youre this big grey matter in between it all.

your jelous side makes me laugh cuz its so hypocritical of you

i accept it and you know it.

i just think its funny is all.

some people may think im stupid for dealing with you, but as twisted as this is, we understand that no matter what, we are always the people we will go back to. 

its a comferting thought yet it scares the hell out of me.

i guess in a nutshell im just trying to say that i care for you and just want you to be happy.

and if we make each other happy then thats all that matters.

"event","so my last entry was back in march...wow..its been awhile.

ive been pretty busy with my life. im finishing up school and hopfully will be working full time by christmas, the latest new years. im still waiting to get into college. the paper work is still processing. 

when i last left you guys, my boyfriend and i had just broke up and i was at a loss. things have changed since then. we havnt kept in touch, but i hear that he is doing fine. thats good. i dont want him to die or anything. there are no hard feelings anymore because i have had the time to realize that it was all better in the end. i wish him and his family nothing but the best in life and hope that he is happy with who is with now.

ive been enjoying the single life, but havnt been entirely single. i havnt had a boyfriend since him, but i do have someone that cares for me and i care for him. its nice knowing that there is someone there for you when you need them. its a really cool thing. i think im pretty lucky. 

um lets see...oh, my sister had a kid in july and shes getting married in october. usually that goes the other way around...but whatever. 

i was in a little car accident yesterday. you really shouldnt play the ""out of state license plate"" game in stop and go traffic. who would have thought that a tiny Pontiac could do more damage to a Dodge Ram 2500 Deisal truck than the truck to the pontiac. but we are all alive and well.

my social life pretty much consists of hanging out at bonfires and hookah bars and north county. i still talk to the same people i did plus about a million more. i totally jumped on the bandwagon and am in love with Fall Out Boy and im so tired of seeing My Chem everywhere but where they should be. but i guess thats what happens when people start buying your cds.

im looking forward to the holiday season and the fact that a new year is on its way. im very optimistic about my life at this point and coulnt ask for more. i hope you all are doing as well. 

i miss you all and i hope to get a bunch of comments from you!!!

if you know him and are reading this...SHUT UP!!! DONT TELL HIM!!
he never reads my lj so im fine with saying it.

there have been some recent developments in my hum-drum life.
i got a tattoo and stiches withen the same week.
only one of those was planned tho.

the tattoo is on the back of my right shoulder.
quite nice. 
once i get some pics you can check them out at my myspace.
the 13 stiches were located on my right pinky.
i was washing dishes when a glass broke and well...you get the picture.
the stiches are gone, but the scar is healing and it looks so nasty.

withen a weekend i registred for school and then unregistared.
went on 2 interveiws.
and am trying to figure out a way to see my boyfriend on new years.
if i get eaither of these jobs i might have to work then i hear that he and his family might go to vegas.
so eaither way i probably wont see him.


of by any chance you are reading this (or those who know him and see him more often then i tell him:) i miss you very much...ive never lied when i said i love you. ive never lied when i said you mean everything to me. i love you.

I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm falling

There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm loving it

Too high
Can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

-Chorus-
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under (Ohh Ohh)
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late 
To give you up
I took a sip 
From my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high 
Can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

-Chorus-
With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

-Chorus- x2

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
(Spoken) I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now


i will never forget that chris!!!"

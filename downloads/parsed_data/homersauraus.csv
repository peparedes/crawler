"event","I've come to realize that I use idioms as something of a verbal crutch. Instead of saying, ""um"" or ""well,"" when my mind draws a blank, or I'm otherwise at a loss for words, I'll blurt out something to try to get the point across. And I didn't even realize it until recently.

I don't think it's a bad thing, however. I'm an attorney, in Texas, who wears boots and seersucker suits (sometimes at the same time, suck on that). And I grew up in the sticks. So my brain is pretty much hard-wired to fall back on a idiom, or colloquialism, whenever I'm trying to convey an idea to a third party that he or she may not understand.

Leigh always gives me a ton of crap for it. She did not grow up in the sticks, she went to a fancy private boarding school, went to Cal for undergrad, etc. Her vocabulary is extensive and well learned. And she uses it correctly.

""Different strokes for different folks,"" I tell her. She is not amused.

Case in point, yesterday afternoon I was at a mediation for one of my clients. It lasted about 4 hours. In that time, I probably used about a dozen different idioms. ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."" ""He hasn't paid one red cent."" ""Get down to brass tacks."" ""Gut feeling."" ""You can hang you hat on it."" ""The ball is in their court."" Etc. And those are just the ones I remember. When the mediation was over, the mediator commented on the frequency with which i went back to the well and used idioms to explain something to my client.

My penchant for using these isn't just confined to meditations. Just look at my last post, where I accidentally quoted Shakespeare in a closing argument, and then followed it up with an idiom about passing a smell test, when the Judge asked me to clarify a point about a legal technicality that my whole case boiled down to. But we won, so I guess it got the point across.

Like I said, I don't think it's a bad thing. I've sat in on a lot of trials and hearings, and the attorneys I liked did the same thing. Knowing that I can sit there and trade barbs with some of the old guard attorneys in town certainly doesn't hurt my confidence, and in turn helps my clients. And heck, maybe it will be something I'm known for with other attorneys and judges (too early to tell at this point), which is not a bad thing - it's better than being known for not knowing what they hell you're doing or not having a firm grasp on the law (which is how I remember some other attorneys I've sat in on or gone up against).

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I guess because I got called to the carpet on it yesterday afternoon, it's fresh in my mind."

"event","This past Wednesday I had a trial, and, since my career is only a little over 4 months old now, I can pretty safely say it was the biggest trial of my career. I'm not sure how much anyone will get out of reading this, because I'm leaving most of the details out (on purpose), but I think this is more for me now than any ""audience.""

It was a big deal, involving allegations of sexual abuse of very young girls by their father - remember, I'm on the civil side, so no one is going to jail based on this trial. But the stakes were pretty high, nonetheless.

This case has been going on for a while. We were brought on in early January through a Legal Aid referral, for a hearing that was happening the next day. We went to that, and got a continuance for 2 weeks. And then at the next hearing, the judge put us on a continuance for another month, in order to allow both sides to conduct discovery, and to give my client time to file a cross-suit (well, it's not really a cross-suit in family law, but I'm probably the only family lawyer who is going to read this so I don't want to get too technical).

The intervening month had quite a bit of legal chicanery that I won't get into, but suffice it to say, the opposing counsel and I had very few words for each other when we walked into court on Wednesday. And I really wanted to win - my overriding concern was making sure the children were safe going forward, but I knew putting on my best case and getting the right outcome would feel even better because there had been no love lost with the opposing counsel.

I didn't think - 5 years ago now, when I was studying for the LSAT, or 3 years ago, when I was starting law school - that I'd ever be in the position I found myself in that day: making a case that had such far reaching implications on another person. And it was not an easy case. We definitely had the evidence to support the relief we were requesting, but it was based on a very technical interpretation of statutory and case law. We had to be sure that we put all of the proper evidence before the court, and get all the proper testimony on the record, in order to allow the judge to make the findings which would allow him to rule the way we were advocating the court should rule.

It was a long day, our pretrial matters started at about 9 am, and the court didn't make it's ruling until almost 6 p.m. - so by the time we were ready for closing arguments I was mentally exhausted. So exhausted, that when the judge stopped me during my closing to ask a question, I accidentally butchered a Shakespeare quote in my response. While I was wearing cowboy boots. Talk about a juxtaposition.

<i>Judge:</i> Counsel, are saying that I should completely deny the father's access to the children going forward, and say that he has no rights or duties with regard to the children, but we not call it a termination? That sounds like termination to me.

<i>Me:</i> Well your honor, I agree that it sounds like termination, and ""a rose by any other name is still a rose"" - however, the case law shows us that calling this rose by another name passes the constitutional smell test set out in <i>Troxel</i>.

<i>Judge:</i> (making a really weird face) OK...

But it worked, I guess. Well, that and the fact that we had the evidence on our side. That also helped.

Anyway, like I said, this entire post probably won't mean much to anyone else, but getting that win, keeping those kids from having to be around a sexually abusive parent, it's something I don't think I'll ever forget."

"event","Aside from not being financially able to raise a kid at this point, I don't have the whole parent mindset down.

Case in point. This evening. I was at the County Line on the Lake with my Dad, Sister, Brother-in-Law, and 2 nieces for an early birthday dinner. Dinner was over, and my nieces wanted to go down to the dock to feed the turtles. I told them it was too cold for the turtles, but they were undetered.

So outside we went, and lo and behold, there were no turtles. So instead of feeding them, we started throwing ""turtle food"" at each other, the girls started chasing each other around, I'd act like I was going to toss them in the lake, etc... I may be about to turn 27, but I can horse around with the best of them. It was starting to get a little out of hand after about 10 or 15 minutes, and frankly I was getting worn out, so I told the girls we could throw one more handful into the lake and then we needed to back inside.

My youngest niece, who is 5, started to act like she was going to push me in the water. I was laughing, but obviously she wasn't going to budge me, so no harm, no foul. She then got a mischievous look on her face, stopped pushing me, and got a running start and shoved her sister, who is 8, in the same manner she had been shoving me.

Key difference though. I'm a full grown man, my oldest niece is a tiny 8 year old - and she wasn't expecting it.

Into the drink she went, headfirst.

I fished her out as quickly as I could and made sure she was ok, and asked the waitress for a towel. They didn't have any, so i just had her hug me to try to dry her off a little bit (cold water, and not the warmest day ever didn't make for the most pleasant swim). And then I started laughing. And couldn't stop.

It was probably not a bad reaction, because instead of being freaked out, my nieces started laughing too. Until their dad came outside.

Whoops.

I guess I won't be getting asked to babysit for awhile."

"event","We're almost 3 months in to actually opening up our own law firm.

We're coming p on the 1-year anniversary of the day that we decided to actually go through with this idea, and not just talk about it.

And this year is starting off great.

It was one thing, when planning to start our own business, to look at the date we expected to be licensed, see that it was during the holidays when work is generally slow, and say ""we probably won't make any money for a month or two and we'll have to live off of our savings."" It was another thing entirely to actually live through those months. There was a lot of doubt as to whether or not we'd made a good decision, whether we actually vocalized it or not. We spent about $8,000 or so on start-up costs and overhead in 2009, and only brought in about $1,000 in fees - it wasn't even enough to pay our bills, much less pay ourselves. We knew we'd lose money the first year, but like I said, it's one thing to know that intellectually, it's another thing to live through it.

Three weeks ago this Sunday, Leigh and I had a long discussion of where we were going from there. We had been licensed about 2 months, and we only had a handful of clients - mostly legal aid referrals, where we get paid AFTER all the work is completed. We had been doing quite a bit of work in December and were keeping busy, but we hadn't actually been paid for any of it yet. And although we had some meetings with potential private clients set up the next week, we weren't exactly sure what would come of those meetings and if we'd even make enough to cover our overhead costs for the next month, or if we'd have to dip into our personal savings. Again. It was a gut check, to be sure.

And then something happened that Monday. I don't know what switch flipped, but our phone literally started ringing off the hook. Since then, we've been swamped, and not just with legal aid referrals. Referrals started coming in from a myriad of sources, friends, family, the internet, LRS, etc. We went from almost nothing on our calendar, to consultations, client meetings, and court dates every day for the entire rest of the month. And it's not slowing down.

It's a good feeling, being busy (and actually getting paid). And being good at what we're doing isn't too shabby either. We've represented our clients in court in four different central Texas counties so far; and we've ""won"" every hearing that we've had in front of a lot of different courts. We've even won at the appellate level as of this past Friday (well, kinda - we weren't the appellate counsel, but we helped them with the facts for the brief and that got us a favorable outcome). I know that our record is going to change at some point (I've been told that if you aren't losing sometimes, you aren't in court enough), but right now our record is still perfect.

And worrying about if we were going to be able to pay all of our bills with revenue from our work? Not a problem right now. We covered all of our bills for January and paid ourselves a modest sum, and have already paid all of the bills for February. We aren't making the same amount as a first year associate at a big law firm, but we're no longer eating into our savings and we're making enough money to support ourselves.

We are in a great place business-wise right now, but we're not taking anything for granted. We have to keep working hard, keep doing well by our clients, and keep building relationships, but I know that success will follow. I've certainly made a few mistakes, and there are a few things that I would have done differently, but I'm happy being where I am after being in business for 3 months, and I know that the sky is the limit."

"event","Not only is UT undefeated this season, so am I.

I haven't even been licensed a month, and I had my first contested hearing today. It was on a case that was referred to us from Legal Aid on Friday. 3 days ago. And the hearing was today. It was a custody case with the kids living in various states, and competing custody determinations (one in Texas and one in the other state). My client was the out of state parent, for what it's worth. If you really want to geek out, look up the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act - that's what this hearing was about, getting the courts to agree which state's order took precedence. 

I spent about 30+ (billable) hours Friday, Sunday, and Monday (I took Saturday off for the game) getting ready for our hearing today. I was ready to have a full blown contested hearing with witnesses, evidence etc. on a myriad of issues, but I also filed some pretrial motions regarding jurisdiction that I hoped would clear everything up. It worked. 

We ended up having to do a contested hearing on the jurisdiction issues that I plead in my pretrial motions. We both put on witnesses to establish the facts. And I won! The judge agreed with us, dismissed the case, and entered the out of state order. My client's daughter is back with her tonight. 

It was a great feeling winning my first hearing. Talking with some other lawyers, apparently that county (Williamson) isn't known for declining to exercise jurisdiction, so it was more of a big deal than I realized when it happened. But the absolute best part was seeing my client reunited with her daughter. 

I definitely chose the right line of work."

If you'll recall, Leigh worked at Legal Aid while we were waiting on our bar results. Well, because of that, we are now on Legal Aid's private attorney referral list. Legal Aid does that when there is a case they want to take on, but they can't for various reasons. We are paid by legal aid, not the clients themselves though. And we were referred two cases about two weeks ago.

Only problem is, we have to wait for the clients to contact us.

Welp, today we finally got calls from both of them. We're meeting with one of our clients tomorrow, and the other on Thursday. I'm still at the office getting intake forms and other minutia finished up so that we can make the most of our meetings, and then get the petitions filled out and filed with the courts (they are both in different counties) later this week. Probably Friday. 

Hopefully this snowball continues to roll and our business ramps up. Last month was exciting, what with finding out I passed the bar exam, getting sworn in and open for business, networking my ass off, etc. But without clients, we won't last very long. And I don't intend to fail."

"event","On Friday, October 9, 2009 Leigh and I went to the Texas Secretary of State's office downtown and filed our partnership registration. We were pretty excited about the whole thing, even high-fiving in the office after all the paperwork was filed. The clerks were non-plussed, and probably thought us strange. So it goes. And even though I don't know if I'm an attorney or not yet, I'm already a partner. Not a bad partner track at all.

My office lease started on October 1st, and we're still in the process of getting it furnished. We have most of the furniture, it's just a matter of getting it over there, and the rain's not helping. I'm glad we started this ahead of time. And as of this morning, our phones are on and the internet is working - both important things. We got a really easy to remember phone number, which I think is great.

Our logo and business cards are 99% done, I think we'll be sending them to a printer this week. Need to be able to give out the cards as soon as I get the good news. I'm thinking of getting our logo on some coozies as well, and then handing those out at an office-warming barbecue we hope to be hosting in about a month. We're also in the process of getting our website built and hosted - but of course not published until we find out for certain that we are licensed and get it approved by the SBOT.

Additionally, Leigh and I are in the process of getting enough CLE to get on the Travis County CAFA court-appointed list next month and start taking CPS cases as soon as we can. We were in Houston a couple of weeks ago for some CLE, and have another full day tomorrow here in Austin. It's kind of a kick in the pants, most new attorneys do not have a CLE requirement, but since we want to take CPS cases we have to get this stuff done.

And I'm officially a familiar face at the courthouse, to the point where most of the judges recognize me, even if they don't all know my name. That can't be a bad thing. I've also been taken under the wing of a few family law attorneys who see me down there all the time, which I hope will continue once I'm actually licensed.

I'm keeping busy, but getting a bit more anxious every day as the release of the bar exam results draws closer. Hopefully I'll have good news to share with y'all in a little less than a month's time. Good thing the weekend before I'll be driving up to Stillwater, that should help take my mind off of it."

"event","I've been interning at the Travis County Domestic Relations Office (DRO for those in the know) for about 3 weeks now. I was waiting on a background check to come through before I jinxed it by writing anything about it. Well, not really, if I passed the BLE's background check to sit for the Bar Exam, I wasn't worried about one from the county. But still, waiting sucked. 

Anywho, the job, such that it has been so far, is 1) very interestng and 2) very insightful. I'm working with the Guardian ad Litems in the DRO - they are all licensed social workers who serve when they are appointed in divorce and custody cases. I know that the things I learn working with the DRO over the next 2 months will be put to use for any client who comes through my door with a custody issue, whether a Guardian ad Litem is appointed or not. In fact, I literally can't think of a job that would teach me more about being an actual practicing family law attorney than this one. It's interesting, the Guardian's only job is to investigate and make recommendations to the court as to what is in the child's best interest. Because of that, you'd think that (and I will counsel my clients in the future to do this) the parents would do all they could to work with the Guardians, follow recommendations and whatnot to increase their chance of getting primary custody of their kids, etc. But it's seldom like that. Usually, at least one side thinks the Guardian is working for the other parent, and sometimes, they both think that. It's really very fascinating, to me at least, to see the client dynamic and how irrational people who are going through custody disputes can get.

What I have done mostly for the past few weeks is sit in on 1-2 different hearings a day, where one of the Guardians is assigned. It's mostly hearings on motions to modify or temporary hearings orders, but they run the gamut from emergency protective hearings to full blown divorces. I'm hoping to get a chance to sit in on at least one divorce jury trial, but I don't know if I'll get the opportunity before I'm done in October. And then I usually go back and rehash and give my opinions of how that particular Guardian came off on the stand, what my feeling is about the strengths and weaknesses of either side, how I think the judge will rule, etc.

However, the reason this is all so helpful for me is that I'm getting to sit in hearings for all the Associate and District Judges that hear family law cases in Travis County, and starting to get a feel for what they like and don't like attorneys to do. And I'm getting to see attorneys from all parts of the spectrum represent their clients in court. For all that law school does, it doesn't ever adequately prepare you to make your case in front of a real Judge and/or jury, that's something you really can't learn except by doing. So while I'm not actually the one on the spot, you can bet I'm taking notes on what to do and what not to do, and I'll be much more prepared to hit the ground running when (knock on wood) I get my bar results in November.

Speaking of my own practice, it's coming along, slowly but surely. I have keys for my office, and Doug finally got some logo renderings to me (which were all great, by the way, the hardest part is going to be choosing one), and we should be meeting with a CPA next week to discuss some various issues related to running our own business. My internship has provided me with just about the best networking tool in the Austin Family Law Bar that I could imagine, just getting the attorneys who are in court most days to recognize me is invaluable. I already have gotten a ton of remarks for wearing my seersucker suit to court earlier this week (good remarks, for the record), so I know that I'm starting to become a familiar face. And I'm getting all my ducks in a row with regards to getting on the various court appointed lists for Travis and the surrounding counties, so that once I'm licensed I can put my name in the hat and hopefully start taking clients from day 1 off the lists. 

There's still a ton to do, I have to go get some CLE in order to qualify for the Travis County CAFA list (so that I can take CPS cases), we need to get our website design finalzed and ready to publish by November, get business cards and letterhead and all that jazz, but it's coming together bit by bit. 

But November will be here soon enough, for now I'm going to enjoy some slightly cooler weather and the fact that football season is almost upon us."

"event","About a month ago, when I should have been studying for the bar exam, I instead went on a blind date. It did not go well. After the date, I immediately called my friend Amanda, told her what happened, and then said ""I've had it with this dating bullshit, will you marry me?"" I was joking, but I would have married her in a heartbeat if we were together. 

I've known Amanda since high school, I had a crush on her then but never did anything about it. We stayed in touch for about a year after highschool, and since I didn't have to see her everyday I finally told her I had a crush on her... after I was already dating another girl at the time so that I couldn't do anything about it, of course. That was the summer of 2002. I lost touch with Amanda after that, changed my cell phone number at some point and her number didn't make it over in one of the phone swaps and my friend Amanda just faded to a pleasant memory.

Until last summer. She got in contact with me through myspace, which is funny, because I had literally forgotten that I even had a myspace page. I found out she was living in Denver, which was great, because I was going to be in Denver in a few months for a UT football game. We traded phone numbers, and when we talked on the phone for the first time in 6 years, it was like we never lost touch. It was amazing. We met up when I was in Denver, I got way too wasted the first night to put any moves on her like I meant to - instead I threw up when we got back to her apartment, then kissed her as a joke to gross her out, then passed out on her couch. Romantic. For whatever reason, she looked past that and still was happy to see me in the morning.

She came to Austin in February, when I was still sporting my ridiculous mustache, and was my date to Law Prom. I finally went to prom with her, 8 years after our senior year of high school. We shared a room at the Hyatt that I had won during the law school's Halloween Party, and I made sure not to throw up this time. A decade after I first had a crush on her. It was worth the wait. We had to cut the sightseeing and such short, however, when she found out that her grandfather had suffered a heart attack. I drove her down to Castroville, where her grandparents still live, and she was able to see her grandfather who was back home after being released from the hospital. She kept apologizing for ruining the weekend by having to spend an entire day out of Austin, but I wouldn't hear anything of it. Who knew how much longer she had to see her grandfather? And besides I knew there'd be other weekends. In fact, I was planning to come visit her in Denver a month after that, because she wanted to teach me how to snowboard. Unfortunately, I'm bad at budgeting, and my student loans weren't enough to cover a ticket up to visit her. She offered to buy my ticket, but I refused, because I didn't think that was fair - I hadn't bought her's to come see me. 

I'm not sure what exactly we had after that. It was a relationship of sorts, but she lived in Denver, I lived in Austin. Neither of us were into any sort of real long distance relationship, but we kept in touch. We talked on the phone once or twice a week at the max, texted each other at random times, etc. We kept making plans to come see the other person that never panned out, and then I asked her to marry me after that horrible date. She said yes, and then we proceeded to get in an argument of whether she would move here or if I would move there. We compromised and said she'd move here after she finished her school next year, and after I had practiced enough to earn reciprocity with the Colorado Bar I was going to open a Denver office of my law firm. We never quite agreed on kids, I suggested that we should just be irresponsible and see what happened, she wanted to adopt, but we agreed to practice no matter what. It was a fun conversation.

We talked a lot in the past month or so, she called me to wish me luck on the bar exam each day, and we were making plans for her to come to Austin again. I was going to pay for her plane ticket this time. I just talked to her on Saturday night, while I was in Chicago for a friend's bachelor party. She told me to be careful. I told her ""olive juice you"" It's a joke from Family Guy. She laughed and told me ""olive juice you too""

My friend Amanda died on Sunday. She fell off a balcony, or a roof, I'm not sure of the details, while hanging out with some friends after work in Denver. They say she died instantly on impact.

My brain knows she's gone, but my heart hasn't admitted it yet."

Oh well, it's behind me. Just spent the last several hours cramming in more for the Texas essays tomorrow (12 all told, another 6 hours).

I'm good to go on these subjects:

Family Law
Community Property
Wills
Estate Administration
Oil and Gas
Agency & Partnership
Consumer Law
Guardianship (if it comes up)

I'm shaky on these subjects, but hopefully can BS my way into a passing answer:

Property (just because there's no rhyme or reason to the questions pattern)
Corporations
Trusts (if it comes up)
Secured Transactions

I'm fucked on the following:

Commercial Paper
Tax (if it comes up)
Bankruptcy (if it comes up)

I hope I have enough in the good/shaky categories to make up for getting zero points on the Commercial Paper essay. 

No matter what happens, I'm done after tomorrow, and that's a great feeling."

It's a great location. A little over 6 miles from my house, so not a long commute. It's an easy, 5 minute drive to the Courthouse. Great visibility on a well traveled thoroughfare, and one that is traversed by the type of people we want to be our clients (i.e., people who can afford to pay us). It is right next to 3 or 4 differnt lunch options, and a short drive to many more. Plenty of parking for us and clients (and it's all free). Super close to Deep Eddy Pool and the Town Lake Trail. And right next door to Deep Eddy Caberet, so I can go grab a beer after a long day. 

And the best part is, they are willing to have us sign a lease, this week, that won't take effect until October, essentially they are foregoing 3 potential months of rent so that we can be sure we have a spot. And they aren't making us pay anyhthing extra to hold it for those 3 months. I was shocked, but very happy when we worked that out.

I'm excited. Now I just need to make sure I pass that bar exam so that I can start taking clients and, you know, paying rent, in November."

"event","And I missed the first 6 innings of the baseball game because I had to go out to the lakehouse and deal with it, since I'm the only family member that lives in Austin.

What appears to have happened is that the water line to the fridge/freezer burst sometime in the past 2 weeks. The last time I was out at the lake was during the weekend of the 6th, and it was fine then. A neighbor noticed it this evening, and from the amount of water in the house and the amount of absorption into the sheetrock, it's been like that for a while. The freezer and fridge went out at some point, so all the food in there was spoiled.

That ruined all the sheetrock behind the fridge first. Also, the cabinets that are near the fridge took in a lot of moisture. It remains to be seen if they'll need to be replaced. After that, the rest of the house flooded. The water level was up to at least 1/4 of an inch in most of the house, including all 3 bedrooms and the bathroom. All of the rugs were soaked, obviously. Much of the funiture has absorbed a lot of water. I'm pretty sure a lot of it will have to be thrown out.

The worst part is probably the walls. The sheet rock had absorbed water up to at least 3 feet, so that will all need to be taken out and replaced. The water was seeping out of the bottom of the house at the foundation at multiple points. All of the exterior walls will have to have the lowest 3 or 4 feet of insulation removed to make sure there's no mold. It looks like even the bottom part of the siding might be bad - but that's just from my eye test, nothing official.

We called and got some remediation people out there tonight. They got most of the standing water out, tore out all of the baseboards. put all of the furniture up on blocks for airflow, and have about a dozen fans and 2 huge dehumidifiers running all night. The AC is also on, because that should help dehudifiy the air. They will be back out there tomorrow to take off the sheetrock, etc. After that we will really know how extensive the damage was.

About the good news is that with the carport, the back patio, and the pop-up-tent, there should be a lot of covered areas to put furniture when it needs to come out. I can also take some and store it at my house if need be while work is going on. And, apparently, the fact that house is all tile now is going to help cut down the chances of mold considerably.

I wish I wasn't studying for the bar right now, in a normal summer I would have been out there more often and maybe found it sooner."

So what happened? I finished law school finals about May 12th. I went on a weeklong drinking spree with about the only person who was also done, one Ms. Meghan Cook (I hope she reads this, she hates being called Ms.). We also ate pretty much every meal together for a week, because, like I said, no one else was done. And went and saw bad movies and whatnot. It was fun.

Then people also finished, and there was more partying to be had. 

And then BarBri started before we even graduated. Although, we still went out after classes - I even went tubing one random weekday afternoon with some friends. Good call.

And then my heterosexual life partner Colin came into town. I went to Shiner Brewery and did the tour the Friday before graduation with my brother, Colin, Ms. Cook, and her siblings. It was glorious. 

And then graduation was on Saturday. I participated in the Law School's Sunflower Ceremony, as well as Universitywide Commencement. I carried the Law School's banner during the grand processional, because I'm kind of a big deal. We had a bit of a rain delay, but it went off without a hitch. Robert Rodriguez gave one of the funnier speeches I've sat through at UT, and the fireworks were awesome, as usual.

And then I had my Memorial Day Barbecue. I smoked 3 briskets, 6 racks of ribs, 3 turkey breasts, and 10 links of sausage. Not to mention, I made my own barbecue sauce. And I had no leftovers. Great success.

And then BarBri started again after a short break. And that is pretty much going to be my life for the next 2 months. I probably won't update much until I take the Texas Bar Exam on July 28th, 29th, and 30th. So, I'll see you then."

So yeah, there's a 1976 Executive Motorcoach parked in front of my hose right now.

It will be taken to Waco this weekend for it's first ""Road Trip,"" although it's not really that far. But got to take it easy while I put her through her paces. 

She recently got out of the shop after having over $7,000 worth of work done. Considering we bought her for $3,000, that's quite an investment. She is going to be an project over the years to be the ultimate roadtrip mobile, but for now I'm happy to have brakes, working AC, and a new fridge. The new carpet and new upholstery will come in due time.

So, without further adieu, here's the tour.

Here we are, looking towards the front of the coach. The couch, upholstered in the finest 1976 style, fold out into a full sized bed. The captains chairs up front are actually pretty ridiculously comfortable.

Don't mind the dust, that's from people replacing the ACs and fridge, and I haven't cleaned it. Hopefully my friend Justin's fiancee will clean it this weekend because she's OCD like that. But what you're looking at is a built in ice maker. Top of the line 30 years ago.

"event","Brooke came into town this weekend because she was my +1 for my friends wedding. She came up on Friday afternoon, and on Friday night we stumbled across some really rinky dink carnival. We decided to go and ride some fairly unsafe looking rides. 

The last ride we rode was called ""The Zipper."" It doesn't sound bad, but it's ridiculous. Here's a picture I found:

<img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/P1150036.jpg/800px-P1150036.jpg"">

So, basically they close you into this little compartment, then off you go into nausea-inducing skies. Here's a description of how it's supposed to work:

<i>It has a long oblong frame (the boom) that rotates like a Ferris wheel, with free-flipping cars suspended on off-center axes that move around the sides of the boom via pulley system. Each passenger capsule is essentially a bench seat that snugly fits two people, built into a compartment of metal mesh contoured to protect the riders' entire bodies. The odd, apostrophe-shaped capsules, spaced evenly along the perimeter of the boom look very much like the rows of interlocking teeth on a zipper, for which the ride was named.

The passenger capsules travel around the perimeter of the boom at 4 rpm, not particularly fast, but the ""flip"" around the end of the oblong frame causes a sudden burst of speed and sends the compartments flipping end over end. The boom itself rotates at 7 rpm in the same direction as the pulley system. This combined but offset rotation provides each capsule with a unique and unpredictable experience. Zippers are capable of rotating both clockwise and counter-clockwise, and most are run with several rotations in each direction constituting ""one ride"".</i>

Which is all well and good, except that 1 - we were the only people on it so they gave us an extra long ride, and 2 - it was a shitty old carnival and the ride wasn't exactly well maintained. I almost knocked a couple of teeth out, I'm pretty sure I got whiplash, and although I'm no doctor, probably got a mild concussion as well. Fun!

At least I this didn't happen:

<i>On September 7, 1977, the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a public warning, urging carnival-goers not to ride the Zipper after four deaths occurred due to compartment doors opening mid-ride. The safety restraints being attached to the door itself, riders are left unrestrained whenever the door is open. The 1977 victims all died after falling from their compartments. The failure was traced to original spring-close latches on the doors wearing out and not being replaced. Compartments on currently operating Zippers are secured using the original latch, a redundant latch approved by the CPSC, and a large R-Key pin as a third backup.

Despite these new safety features, the same scenario was repeated in July 2006 in Hinckley, Minnesota when two teenage girls were ejected from the their compartment as the door swung open. Their door was apparently not properly closed by the operator who admitted to local law enforcement that he had not inserted the safety pin (R-Key) before starting the ride. Both of the victims, Erica Matrious and Breanna Larsen, survived the incident despite facing some serious injuries.</i>

And now, back to my seminar paper."

"event","I called my dad this evening to tell him I'm going to hang my shingle straight out of law school and start my own law firm.

He was in Atlanta, meeting with some of his agents (he's a GA for a midsize life insurance company), on a trip through the Southeast with stops in Atlanta, Tampa, etc. where he's absolutely killing it financially. In fact, he was at a steak house ordering a NY Strip when I called (I know, because he made me hang on while he placed his order). He's going to end his visit near Savannah, GA, to visit my little brother at his post at Fort Stewart. 

I wasn't sure what he'd say when I told him my plans. But I don't know that I've ever heard him be prouder of me. And that's saying a lot, the man brags on me like I'm the smartest person in the world. Einstein ain't got shit on me in my dad's eyes. 

We had a good talk, and just before I got off the line I told him the check he wrote to BarBri for my bar prep should be clearing soon because I got an email confirmation that I was enrolled in the course. In years past, that could have been a problem. I mentioned he's on an extended business trip, and he's done really well lately, but when I was growing up it wasn't like that. 

When I was younger, for as long as I could remember, he had always been at the top of his field at the life insurance company, making a lot of money and supporting his family well. We lived in a nice house and my parents drove nice cars. But one thing he did on the side that he was really passionate was operate a business as an Outfitter. He sold guided whitetail hunts in South Texas and Mexico. I think it started as a way to subsidize leases on some really expensive ranches in the heart of the big buck country that he wouldn't have been able to afford any other way. All I know is that by the time I was in 4th or 5th grade, he had stopped being a GA for the life insurance company and went out full time to make his Outfitter business his sole source of income.

And it failed. Miserably. And I mean miserably. The ranch he was basically counting on to be able to run his business year round (it had exotics, huge stocked fishing tanks, turkey, quail, hogs, etc.) didn't renew his 10 year lease. The other ranches he got on couldn't provide year round income. Coming home to no electricity because he didn't pay the light bill was a regular occurrence. I was made fun of in jr. high because I literally only had 7 or 8 different shirts to wear, and I cycled through them pretty regularly. We lost the house I grew up in when I was a freshman in high school.  He had to declare bankruptcy sometime around then. I was smart, played sports, and was fairly popular, but I still felt the stigma of being the ""poor kid."" He went back to work for the insurance company, but he never made as much as he used to, because he just didn't work as much.

But even through all that my dad was always there. He'd find enough money to give me gas money (even if the car I drove was 15 years old and broke down every week) during the school year so I wouldn't have to work and could concentrate on my extracurriculars. He came to every single football game I ever played. Literally. From the time I was on B Team in 7th grade and hardly ever saw the field, until I was a starter on my varsity football team my senior year, he was at every game. And although I always felt like I didn't have almost anything I really wanted materially, I can never say I didn't feel like my dad was there for me. Too much, to be honest, by the time I graduated high school I could not wait to be out of the house. 

I put myself though undergrad. All my dad paid for was my cell phone (and my mom paid for my car and health insurance - they're divorced). Luckily, most of the cost of my education was paid for by scholarships, but I took out a few thousand dollars in loans to cover the difference. I worked during my last few years of undergrad to make car payments and rent, but I always felt like it would have been a whole hell of a lot easier if I was like my friends, who's parents paid for their school, and car, and rent, and on and on. I've done the same for law school - minus the help on the cell phone and insurance. And minus scholarships for the most part, I've financed my education and I'll be paying it off for a long time to come.

But the funny thing is, shortly after my little brother graduated highschool, my dad started working like the old days, the days I barely remember. Long, long business trips. He bought a new car for the first time in a decade. He bought a few acres of riverfront property just outside my hometown, and few years later built a house. He's been one of the top performers for his company for several years in a row now. And by all accounts, even in this economy, he's doing extremely well. Like I said, he paid for my BarBri - and I'm extremely grateful I didn't have to take out more loans to pay for that too.

But I was also a bit bitter for a few years. When he built his house, I wondered why he didn't work like that when I was in high school, so I could have lived there when I was still under his roof, instead of living in apartment after apartment. Or why I couldn't have had the cool shoes or ""in style"" clothes when I was in Jr. High and High School and all of that matters so much. Or why he didn't pay for my college, or my car, or any of the costs I assumed just to get away and live on my own.

That bitterness ate away at me for a few years, my early twenties I guess. I hardly ever came home from college, and I dreaded our long hunting trips together over winter break, looking for any excuse to leave and come back to Austin to hang out with my friends.  I guess it was kind of a delayed teenage loathing, I was just too busy when I was in high school to really reflect on what I didn't have, even if it was always in the back of mind. 

I don't know exactly when it mellowed out, probably some time after i graduated from undergrad. And it was because I realized why he did it all. Graduating from college didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I had 2 older sisters who had both already graduated from college, so it wasn't like it was some huge event. And for me, college, like high school, was fairly easy. I was never in danger of failing, I got mostly A's, had a good time, lived the life you should live as an undergraduate. But he was so damn proud that whole last semester when I was about to graduate.

I remember distinctly one day, about a month before graduation. It was honors day, and I was getting another honors cord to wear for graduation, and we ran into one of my professors. We stopped and chatted, my professor politely said I was a good student, like I'm sure he says to any parent he meets, and we parted ways. It was no big deal to me, but my dad was just in awe of the fact that his son had made such an impression on a college professor. 

And it's moments like that which made me understand why he did what he did. Why he left the high paying job and started his own business, one that would afford him the time to be around that he otherwise wouldn't have. He wanted to be around when his kids were growing up. He didn't want to work the long hours, the odd hours, take the 2 week business trips. Because it would mean he'd miss seeing my siblings and I grow up. Mind you, he's never told me this, but hearing family friends tell me how much my dad talks about me and my siblings it's painfully obvious.

And so, as I sit and ponder just what the hell I'm getting myself into by starting my own law firm fresh out of law school, I know I'd never be in the position I am if it wasn't for my dad.

I just wouldn't be able to stomach the risk and uncertainty of starting out like this if I didn't have his example.  Even though the outfitter business that he built failed, he set an example that some things are more important than money. Not to mention I've seen him pick up the pieces and have a successful career after all of that, so I know that even failing isn't the end of the world.  It's far from a desired outcome, but I'm not deterred by the risk.

That's not to say that I'm unafraid at the prospects that I could fail, be up to my eyeballs in debt, and have a toxic credit score for years to come. In fact, those thoughts terrify me. But I'm motivated to never let that happen because, among a myriad of other reasons that aren't important to the central thesis of this missive, I don't want to let my dad down. I know he wants to brag about how successful his lawyer son is. 

And I bet you he's already doing it, even though I haven't even taken the bar exam yet."

I've decided, today, that I am going to start my own law firm. I've known for a while that was an eventual goal of mine, but I'm doing it now. Right now. 

Of course, I have to graduate and get licensed in order to practice, but I'm no longer actively looking for a job. I have a friend who I am going to partner with, we're actively looking for office space in Austin, and we're making as many contacts as possible and getting as much advice as possible.

I haven't been this excited about something in a long, long time."

Actually, it turned into a prove up rather than a trial. Dad's attorney showed up literally 5 minutes before central docket (watching some out of town attorneys get all bamboozled by central docket was amusing) and agreed to stipulate to both the (N) and (Q) grounds - constructive abandonment and knowingly committing acts that caused him to be incarcerated.

So instead of giving opening/closing statements and questioning witnesses in an adversarial setting, we all went up to the judge, the DA questioned the CPS worker and CASA for about 5 minutes to get the statutory requirements on the ground, no one objected, and I rested and closed without ever doing anything.

Then went to Trudy's for $5 mexican martini Monday."

"event","It's only a bench trial (no jury), but it's still a trial. 

It's for one of my cases in the Children's Rights Clinic. My clients are two young kids (6 and 8) who have been in the State's care for over a year. Considering all they've been though, they are doing awesome, but it's still pretty sad. They don't even want to go home to their parents at this point and just want to be adopted so that they won't be in limbo any more. It is so rare in cases like this where kids that age no longer want to go home.  

So tomorrow we (the DA's office and the CRC) are going to trial to terminate the parent-child relationship between their father and my clients so that they can be adopted. He's locked up in the Federal Pen and won't be there in person, but we still have to prove the elements of constructive abandonment (mom in the case has already stipulated to another ground for termination so we don't need to worry about her).

I finished up my opening statement, and have most all of the questions I expect to ask the witnesses prepared. I'm sure something will come up, but I was preparing for this trial last week instead of studying for the MPRE, so I should be able to be on top of it.

I'm not going to lie, I'm a little nervous. Although I'm also pretty stoked that I get to first chair my first trial before I even graduate law school. 

And I can't help but think how different my path in law school has been than I expected it to be when. I never saw myself being a litigator, much less putting on a case in a real trial before I graduated."

"event","At least for my mustache, it is.

Saturday night is it's last hurrah. Why Saturday night? Because that's ""Law Prom"" and it's the last good photo opportunity for it. Also, my prom date asked me not to shave it before she sees it (she lives in Denver and is flying down for the weekend - Score!). 

It's served me well. I didn't win the ""Sweetest 'Stache in Austin"" last Friday like I had hoped-some dude who had a 4-foot-long mustache did (seriously)-but it was still a great time. I had lots of beers bought for me and I had lots of random girls that wanted to take pictures with me. 

I will miss my 'stache, but it's time for us to part ways. It's gotten to the point where the annoyances of it outweigh the comedic effect. It's not all bad, however, I've found that kids really like it. That sounds bad, but it really does help with breaking the ice with my clients when I go and see them. Seriously, I had to go visit some clients tonight to tell them about some expanded visitation and answer their questions about what's going on with their mom, and the thing they liked the most about the whole visit was talking about my mustache, not their mom. 

God that whole last paragraph is going to come back to haunt me when it's quoted out of context some day. 

Anyway, I'm sure I'll have another beard when I'm studying for the bar exam. Maybe I'll just shave and leave the 'stache again when it's time for me to be inducted into the State Bar next fall. That will play well."

I went to the new Lil Woodrows that replaced it on the Drag, and fuck that place. It's too clean and faux weathered. And fuck their dumb-but-kind-of-hot-if-you've-had-too-many bar bimbos who don't even know what beer costs on other nights. We were trying to figure out if it would be worth our time to come back. Newsflash - it won't be.

They changed everything that was good about Showdown. The only thing they kept was the wood stove, and it's just for looks - it was balls cold tonight and they didn't have it going. I remember going into Showdown on cold nights and making sure that I wasn't sitting to close to that wood stove because it was hotter than shit. Now it's just an accessory.

And they don't even have any dartboards. None. What. The. Fuck. I can't even count how many games of darts I played on Showdown's shitty boards - hell, for a couple of years it was impossible to get a double bull on the left board because the cork was so worn out, but we played anyway.

No mugs.

No regulars.

No frito pie.

No happy minutes.

No bartenders getting on the loudspeaker and telling minors to get off their patio.

No witty bathroom humor.

No pinball.

Nothing.

I never had a mug, the bartenders never knew my name, and I never even carved my name into a table, but Showdown was MY bar. If I wanted to get a Lone Star and hang out with some friends, Showdown was the place. It's not anymore. And I hate them for that."

"event","1 - I was at dinner with my family last night at a seafood restaurant in San Antonio because it was my little brother's last night in town before he goes back to Georgia.  I ordered a bowl of seafood and andouille gumbo, it had some oysters in it, among other things. I know some people just swallow oysters, but I actually enjoy the flavor of oysters so I always chew them a little. The first bite into an oyster I feel something hard - very srange, oysters are about the consistency of flan or something when they're cooked, no hard parts. I spit out the offending hardness, and I find that I nearly ate a pearl. No shit, there was actually a pearl in my oyster. It wasn't big by any means, but I don't know how many oysters I've eaten before, and this is the first time I've ever had a pearl in one.

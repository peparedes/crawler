"event","01. Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. The good sense of the community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now, even in the country, the pentagonal construction has superceded every other.

02. Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first? Drew's pillow

03. What is the last thing you watched on tv? Ocean's Eleven

04. Without looking, guess what time it is. 10:31

05. Now look at the clock, what is the actual time? 10:45

06. With the exception of the computer, what can you hear? People in the hallway, my typing, the wind, cars, loud annoying people, footsteps.

07. When did you last step outside? I left work and it was misty and dark and I liked it.

08. Before you came to this website, what did you look at? My friends page and I saw Daniella's survey and I was intrigued.

09. What are you wearing? Jeans, hoodie, t-shirt

10. Did you dream last night? Yes, yes I did.

11. When did you last laugh? When we decided to have a class fundraiser revolving around lawn gnomes. Then someone asked me something and I said ""gnome it's not.""

12. What is on the walls of the room you are in? Show fliers, a shawshank redemption, beatles, weakerthans posters, some anti-bush posters that I got from this professor Anastacia in the sociology department, guitar chords poster.

13. Seen anything weird lately? This woman in one of the labs had one eye that was smaller than the other. It was pretty weird.

14. What do you think of this quiz? I haven't wanted to take a quiz in like 4 years, it's pretty good. Also it doesn't have a lot of redundant questions.

15. What is the last movie you saw? Ocean's Eleven but the last first time movie was Friday Night Lights. Explosions in the Sky did the sound track which was why I went to see it. It had Billy Bob Thorton and it was about a texas high school football team but it was actually a lot better than I was expecting.

16. If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first? Two plane tickets to Haiti.

17. Tell me something about you that I don't know. I just scratched my ear.

18. If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do? I like the idea of a world without countries. Not eliminating cultures, just geographic boundaries.

19. Do you like to dance? Sometimes.

20. George Bush: eats it.

21a. Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her? Acelcia

22. Would you ever consider living abroad? Yeah, I consider it a lot."

"event","While trying to come up with a list of bands to play these shows that some friends and I are doing on campus I came across the Alison Ranger website. It's a shame that they broke up, they were my favorite local band for a long time. Until they stopped playing local shows or when I didn't have a car to go to West Chester to see them. Anyway, right when they broke up they received this email. This makes me really happy...

""Coincidentally, at the time that we stopped playing, this young lady emailed us:

From :    RANGER,ALLISON NICOLE <aranger@xxxx.edu>
Sent :      Thursday, April 29, 2004 2:46 PM
To :         alisonranger@hotmail.com
Subject :                hello!

Hello, I found your website online and I don't know if you are still a band,
but I wanted to tell you that my name is Allison Ranger so I really think
that your band is cool. Except for that it only has one ""L"" but still, what
are the chances, you know? Anyways, email me back if you get this and let
me know if you are still playing and so forth. Good Luck and very creative
band name.

Allison Ranger

After years of joking around and creating this fictitious persona, a real
Allison Ranger reveals herself.  Allison, you can now have your name back."""

We go on mucking about with instruments and cardboard and test pressings and distribution deals in ways that we hope will avoid or at least minimise corruption of the work, all the while knowing our freedom to do so is soaked in the blood of innocents.  Music means very very little in all of this, but if it can somehow speak to THIS, we humanise ourselves a little along the way."

Soon I will be 19 years old and 19 years closer to something. I'm sure something is in store for me. I won't let it scare me but I can't help being afraid. I miss my family and my grandparents. 

Yesterday I watched from above as little kids dressed in costumes walked around the mall with their parents. It made me ridiculously happy. Afterwards I ate at Arby's for the first time in something like four years. I think the mall will always equal roast beef sandwich in my brain.

I took my sister to camp today and talked to my friend Maggie who is working there this summer. Hopefully we'll hang out soon or something. I miss that place a lot. I made some pretty good connections with a few people while I was a camper and while I worked there but I don't think that's what I miss. I can't exactly figure it out. I don't even know if that place is real sometimes.

I was digging through my closet today and I found my old yo-yos. Pretty awesome. I've been playing around with them a bit today and I don't plan on stopping.

I stopped calling everyone. I feel bad. I havent done anything really in a couple weeks it seems like. I should call people though, but I probably won't for whatever reason. I really really really would like to have a girlfriend sometimes. But it's my fault, whatever! Anyway, I don't feel like staying up late doing nothing tonight so I'm going to go to sleep I think."

From the dirt in which we live

You remember how good the earth was to us a few seasons ago
This place was green and we heard the sounds of life
Screaming from behind tree leaves
You said we'd make the best of what we have
If we couldn't survive the drought how would we make it through the storm?

The shovels chipped and my hands blistered as I dug my own hole
The cracked ground unfolded in the shape of puzzle pieces
I was its de-constructor, fooled into believing I was savior
I was salt to an open wound, an insult to injury, a cliche analogy

You see, it's so much easier to put the blame
On the lack of tools or the arid soil
Than to turn the accusing finger on myself
I broke beauty and then I pulled the pieces apart"

"event","This morning I woke up in my text book, I took a test on that material later in the day, I made $5 off it because the kid next to me nearly copied my entire test and he was like ""dude, I'll buy you lunch, you are the man"" (I suggested the lunch buying actually but he was like here's five bucks). So I guess that was pretty cool. I had another test later, I planned to study for this one after the first one. But since I fell asleep in said text book, I did not. So basically I cheated off the teacher, it was pretty great and I got an A. Not my most academically honest day but I am afraid I don't give a damn. I drove to school listening to Weezer's Pinkerton and I felt happy and sad and happy. And sad. But we left on a happy/sad note with Butterfly. Work was super great, I delt with a lot of super shitty people with super shitty attitudes, and then I got a super sharp nail in my once super inflated tire. Got home from work about an hour late. My mom yelled at me about money shit. I guess I kind of started it. I'm sick of not having money, barely or not being able to afford college, prom, car insurance, tuxedo, new tires, new shoes. Haha, I must sound really poor after the bit about new shoes. It's not really as bad as it sounds. I mean, I could get new shoes if I really had to, but I've learned to stretch a fucking dollar. And a fucking pair of sneakers. I'm listening to Butterfly again. I'm really scared that I'm going to fuck things up. I'm going to be officially in debt for the first time in September. Like a lot of money in debt. I don't want to live my life worried about money. Fuck fuck. I'm really afraid of not being able to reach all these goals I'm setting for myself. Shannon's taking me to school tomorrow. I'm getting my hair cut after school. I have this dinner tomorrow night. I'm working friday, I'm working saturday, I have a breakfast thing on sunday. Hey monday, nice to see you."

We are all co-authors of this dancing exuberance where even our inabilities are having a roast. We are the authors of ourselves, co-authoring a gigantic Dostoevsky novel, starring clowns. This entire thing we're involved with called the world is an opportunity to exhibit how exciting alienation can be. Life is a matter of a miracle that is collected over time by moments, flabbergasted to be in each other's presence. The world is an exam to see if we can rise into the direct experiences. Our eyesight is here as a test to see if we can see beyond it. Matter is here as a test for our curiosity. Doubt is here as an exam for our vitality.""

I am sick of listening to Dubbya skirt around the issues. Someone should give him a napkin I think he has some shit leaking out the sides of his mouth. Time to turn off the TV.

Back to thinking and writing."

"event","The news on television usually doesn't affect me. Tonight it did, it was more about Iraq. More dead soldiers. ""My son gave his life for America."" Fuck America. Fuck this war. We should not be over there. We shouldn't have gotten involved with Iraq. Even if that means Saddam would still be in power. Who cares? He was not an immediate threat to the United States or more importantly the world. Honestly, his removal was not imperative, it could have waited. But what's done is done. And now that it's done can someone tell us why we're there? Mr. President, you got us involved in an unjustified war. You promised proof, weapons of mass destruction. You also promised to capture Osama bin Laden but I'm sure mostly everyone has forgotten about him anyway so it's probably best to just pretend he's gone, right? You've given us nothing. I bet you're making your daddy proud anyway, you finished up his business. More soldiers will die. There will be more talk about how they willingly signed up for the military and act as if a soldier's death is less tragic than anyone else's. America is the 15 year old girl with her daddy's credit card and a night with nothing to do but spend time and money on shit she doesn't need. Colonel Matterson should have thrown that in his ramblings in Cuckoo's Nest. Just because we have men and women who are willing to die for their country doesn't mean we should start a war whenever we want. I mean, we can, we've proved that. We don't need anyone's approval because Amurca is the best country and anyone who says otherwise is a terrorist, a red, a hippie, a flag-burner, a traitor, a spy, et cetera. Anyway...

I have been working a lot lately. It's tiring but in a week or so I will have 1/4 of my car insurance paid off and then I can start putting some of this money in my own pocket. My foot really hurts. I think I fucked it up today. Yesterday was pretty cool, we went to Newport. I see this guy cleaning his car but I figure that there's someone else in the house so why bother him if he's busy. I start walking towards the door and he says ""hey man, what are you selling?"" I turn around and it's Joe Ruff with a big smile on his face. Haha, it was awesome seeing him. We talked for like 20 minutes, he asked about Kendall, about what I've been doing, where I'm going to school next year. I found out that he's majoring in Management Info Systems at UD. This is what I plan on majoring in but he said that UD's program is shit. They have an excellent business school but UD considers MIS to be along the lines of Computer Science and from what I understand they do not have too great of a computer department. So this gives me more reason to stop considering UD and look forward to Arcadia. It was cool as shit to see him. About an hour later I look around and I start laughing because I'm standing on Rich's street. So I head over to his house but he he was out. I gave him a call and he thought it was pretty funny that I'm basically a door-to-door salesman. He told me to give him a call soon so we could hang out. I had been thinking about how I wanted to do that earlier this week actually so I told him I would. Later Sean Milligan drove by but didn't recognize me. It was also Jamie Chance's neighborhood. I believe Mike Bonk is home now, I'm going to give him a call this weekend. I owe Daniella a phone call this weekend too. Kendy got a car, she's going to drive me around in it and :) I'm really looking forward to Chinatowning/Deathcabbing it up with her on Monday. Good times ahead. Spring Break! The new Modest Mouse CD is quite excellent. It's been playing almost the whole time I've been typing despite the ""current music"" selection. I saw two cats keeping dry under a car on my way home and it made me smile. I really like those silhouette looking things that people have in their yards. I saw one the other day of a little boy and girl about to kiss and it was awesome. I really dislike circular stones leading to a front door. No one takes steps that small. Seriously. I was thinking about how much I would hate to have a neighbor with ridiculously tacky ornaments strewn about their yard. Especially across the street. Having to wake up and see plastic birds and deer and fake yellow flowers every morning. Never! One more thing while I'm on a rant about houses. Just because your husband is a contractor doesn't mean you are exempt from home maintenance. Christ, look at your house. Don't give me an attitude just because you're married to a guy who puts roofs on homes for a living. Your windows are shit and your siding is falling off. I'm just trying to help. I love when cute moms come to the door with their newborn babies. Nothing makes me happier when I'm working. Except when they want to set up an appointment. And then I'm like... oh shit."

Sometimes I feel like I've missed out on too many things too many times. I can't be my parents. I can't be you or him or her (here come the sex change comments) or anyone I look up to. Sometimes I really like being myself. It's just certain situations that I get myself into that make me question things. I'm too vague with my entries. But there's no need for details, it's the same shit everyone else goes through. I started a sentence with ""I just need..."" and then I backspaced because I realized I don't need anything. I have everything I need. Maybe a little more patience would help. I guess sometimes I think I'm some kind of miracle worker. I can't fix everything or everyone. It's really just been this week. Let's blame it on the weather. We'll fix the clocks this weekend and everything will be sunshine."

I'll tell them about how the sky used to look before it was fogged up with half-transparent banners. The trees will slowly turn to decoration and oxygen will seep from underground pipes. I'll tell them about how the trees used to grow and change with the seasons. We'll go to the museum to look at the dinosaurs and airplanes. On the way home I'll tell them about the fossil fuels that the dinosaur times left us and how our antique aircraft used it all up. They'll think about all the lives, money, and non-renewable resources we could have saved had we not ignored tree-huggers. They'll hear about reports of government pay-offs to inventors of cars that generate energy from human emotion. They'll laugh at how stupid we were to silence the geniuses only to drain every last dollar they could from the cancer generation. As the road deflects the rain and locks our lane, our car will talk to those around it. I'll turn off the windows, we'll close our eyes and wait to arrive at grandma's house for thanksgiving dinner."

Last night was stupid, it was a reminder of why I am the person I am as well as a reminder of why I'm in love with the person I am in love with. People are too fake, my true friends aren't. Anyway, sometimes it's good to just break out of routine and hang out with some new people, if anything, it makes me more appreciative of what I have. Eric creeped up on me at Wendy's at 1 in the morning and I hung around with him for a while it was cool, sometimes the way he looks at things don't make sense to me, but at least he is honest. Now I am listening to Cry Me a River, this song is awesome. I just put a bid in on an adapter for my car antenna so I can get some radio in there when I want to. It's comforting that every thought comes back to one person. It made me really happy to talk to you last night, even if it was a quick chat, sorry for waking you up.

"event","Right now I should be studying for this big test but I would rather write about my week. Brett Kelly and Jeff Edmiston, two sophomores from my school, died in a car accident on Friday night. I never knew either of them, Jeff doesn't seem like the kind of person I would be friends with but Brett seems like a really cool kid, I would have especially liked to know him. I found out the news on Saturday morning/afternoon. Sunday was one of those days where I just let myself be carried by whatever came my way. I got up early to go to church, it was really boring and I do not like that priest very much, but I had never gone to church on my own before, so I did. I wrote the names of Jeff and Brett in the big book of the deceased in the back. Then I hung out with JP, Vinny, and Matt. It was fun, I played around with JP's expensive recording equiptment and we drove around telling people ""I'm Rick James bitch"" and went to McDonalds. That night I went to work for my school's Alumni Calling Campaign to get them to donate money to our school. It was cool, I got to work with Eric, Franco, Greg May and Ms. Packer. Mmm. Greg May invited me to go to this abandoned factory with him. I was really excited because I remember trying to find this factory with Mike Radka, Rich and Daniella a while ago but we never did. Dan Shannon, Bruce Smith, Laff, Pulliam, and Drew Franco all packed into Greg's big van and headed to the factory and it was fun. I practically jumped into the arms of Franco when someone flipped a switch inside the place and some huge machine started going apeshit. That was scary. Later we went to visit the crash site. Broken CDs, various car parts, skid marks, blood. Each hinting at what happened and revealing a little bit about the kids involved. Candles, flowers, photographs and memories covered the tree that severed the car in two and the living from the dead. The driver, Tim Day, survived. Brett and Jeff's side of the car split off in another direction. It was a strange drive home. On monday we didn't have school and I started my job. I remember stepping out of my car, getting out to start making my rounds through the neighborhood and seeing Tim Day's face on Action Six news, on a big screen TV, through a large bay window, across the street. This whole scenerio is odd to me. I didn't even know what a bay window was about an hour prior to this. Anyway, that continues to stand out in my mind. On Tuesday we had school. There was nothing special about this day. I worked again, it snowed, sleeted and rained while I knocked on doors. Wednesday was Jeff's funeral at school. His family chose to have it there. They lost two sons during their sophomore year at Sallies. I did what little I could to help, directed traffic, handed out programs. I'm bad with estimation but there were so many people at the school that day. I cried during the funeral, they were normal tears. But as I stood among friends and family of friends and family, I thought about what it would be like if that was me inside the casket, I pictured the ones I love crying over me. Every cry I heard sounded like Kendall or my mom or dad or Daniella or anyone I love and I cried more. I kept myself together but it was hard. I wanted to hug everyone. I still do. Today was Brett's funeral. His family held it at St. Helenas, the sophomore class went on about 8 buses with police motorcycle escorts. Jon, Neil and I also hopped on a bus. It was a beautiful service. Due the the no seating, we got stuck in the choir section, made up of ursuline, sallies and padua, we tried our best to fit in during the parts when only the choir stands up to sing by doing the same. There was a random old man among the high school kids. He was a cool guy. Again, the funeral was very sad. Neil wrote a poem for Jeff and Brett: http://yougothosting.com/prayer/ it's awesome. I put up a little tribute on the school site: http://www.salesianum.org if you go there and click in you'll see it. 
There are ways that things could be easier. I'm still wanting my face on your cheek. I'm still waiting to hold onto you forever. I'll always be here, whenever you need me."

"event","so the days are winding down until school starts.... its kinda nerve wrecking... i still havent found out my roommate and im kinda anxious to know what he's like...&nbsp; i hope we get along..&nbsp;  so im kinda prepin for the move out and starting to pack up the shit...&nbsp; its kinda a wierd feeling.. and my mother isnt makin it better.... im bringing all this useless crap that i dont think i need and im gunna have no room to live in my dorm... the roommate im sure is gunna love that......&nbsp;  but other than that nothing much is goin on...&nbsp; i bought most of my class books today... talk about pricey... that one definitly hurt the wallet...&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 books and $267 later....&nbsp;  seems kinda rediculous for books if u ask me but what do i know.... im just a stupid college student....&nbsp;  

put another boring night up on the board for me..... i definitly spent 4 straight hours watching tv.... everyone who i called was busy... of course i find out later that melanie did the same thing tonite.... oh well&nbsp; &nbsp; next time ill remember to call her....

the more and more i read about and look at recording studios and things of that nature the more and more i wanna do that... on the other hand i still got my interest in politics and teaching... i wish i knew what i wanted to do...&nbsp; hopefully things will start to fall into place as i continue going to school.. i just hope i figure it all out soon so i can get out of school fast and move on with my life..."

im all about the lyrics...

ashlee simpson
""pieces of me""
On a Monday, I am waiting
Tuesday, I am fading
And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
Then the phone rings, I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cuz you've come to rescue me

Fall... With you, I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts

[Chorus:]
Ohhhhh
It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Ohhhhh
It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody, messy
I get restless, and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy it's a mission
And you won't stop til I'm there

Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast
Well, I hit that bottom
Crash, you're all I have

[Chorus:]
Ohhhhh
It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Ohhhhh
It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know everything I'm about to say?
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face...
I hope it never goes away... yeah

On a Monday, I am waiting
And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...
So I can dream

[Chorus:]
Ohhhhh
It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Ohhhhh
It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
Ohhhhh
I love how you can tell
Ohhhhh
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...


thats all for now... im not really tired but i dont know what else to write down..."

had to pay my bills today.... boy did that one hurt alot...    thank god graduation party is this weekend.... ill need the cash...

mark is workin tomorow morning instead of Ken...  that made my day... i love workin with mark... i hope were not too busy and its not that hot during the day... i wonder if ill do some more am stuff... well hafta see...

ive been listening to dave matthews band live stuff like non stop  im so excited for friday nite... i cant wait    and im happy cuz lisa is just as if not more excited than i am...   i hope she has fun... and i hope i do too      but i know we will!!!!!!!

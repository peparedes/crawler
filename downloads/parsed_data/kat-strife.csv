"event","<lj-cut text=""KS goes to see the gruff, scarred up samurai-equivalent who took her in and raised her when her parents died while mountain-climbing in Wutai.  This scene takes place after Eli ShinRa asks her to train SOLDIER candidates at a company outing."">

[Scene: KATRIN STRIFE walks up the path to AZUMA HOJO's dojo.  Her hair is down and wind-blown over her head, and she wears an exhausted look as she plods up the path.  It is a brisk fall afternoon.  The trees form a canopy over the dojo - the ones on the outskirts are bright yellow, and above the house, closer to orange and red.  Among the yellow leaves, KATRIN spots a young boy, about twelve years old, fiercely practicing his moves.  The boy stops when KATRIN comes within three feet of him.  He looks up at her, and she stops, with a deadpan expression on her face and an unlit cigarette in her mouth.]

BOY: Who are you?
KATRIN: I'm guessing you're Azuma's latest foundling.
BOY: ::blinks:: How did you know that--
KATRIN:  I guess Azuma-sensei has a knack for finding gaijin orphans whose tourist parents have died.
BOY: ::flushes red::
KATRIN: ::does a meaningful hand gesture:: Don't worry, kid.  I'm not here to cause trouble.
BOY: ...::nods, backs out of the way::

[KATRIN reaches the yard, where AZUMA is meditatively raking.  After a moment, he notices her, and KATRIN takes the cigarette out of her mouth respectfully.  AZUMA doesn't look up, but speaks...]

AZUMA:  This is most unexpected.
KATRIN: ::sets briefcase down:: Yeah, for you and me both, Azuma-sensei. ::bow:: How have you been?
AZUMA: *bow* I am well. Not much changes up here. That is why I like it. But you look upset; what brings you?
KATRIN: I've been selected as a prospective trainer for ShinRa SOLDIERs. Most of my job would be to raise little kids and teach them how to fight, but I...I don't know. It's weird. I don't know how to feel.
AZUMA: *sits on a bench overlooking the garden* Training children is hard work. I speak from experience. *wink*
KATRIN: That's why I came to seek your infallible advice. ^_-
AZUMA: *laughs* You never seemed the child-raising type, I will admit. Even as a child, you didn't like children much.
KATRIN: That's why I'm apprehensive about this job. I think if things get really sticky, I might just come back here..
AZUMA: You are always welcome here, of course. But it would be unfair to take on the responsibility and then run from it.
KATRIN: I wouldn't run after I met the kids...but I might before. I don't know. I just want to keep the job I have now. ::sits on the bench next to him::
AZUMA: Life is full of change, my dear. Even up here. *points to small town near the horizon that is quickly becoming a city*
KATRIN: ::looks up:: Wow. That was all trees when I was growing up. 
AZUMA: Someone approached me last week about selling my land. I turned him down, of course, but he did not seem happy. Very soon there might not be any trees even here.
KATRIN: Was it a foreigner?
AZUMA: No, a man from the north, but he wore a western suit.
KATRIN: What was his name?
AZUMA: I believe he said it was Jin Tseng. He left me a card. *fumbles through robe and produces it, despite the fact that robe does not actually have pockets*
KATRIN: ...huh. I feel like I should recognize him...
AZUMA: I will not be calling him, so you may take the card if you like.
KATRIN: ::obtains businesscard:: I'll share it with the folks back at Midgar. ::puts away:: You wanna spar a litte bit, for old time's sake?
AZUMA: That would be lovely. *stands*

KATRIN: ::battlemusic::
AZUMA: *waits for action bar to fill =P*
KATRIN: ::rolls 10-sided die::
AZUMA: *is l33t, so has a to-hit of 9*
KATRIN: ::rolled a 2 D|::
Azuma: *pwns j00* You must calm yourself. You cannot concentrate if you are upset.
KATRIN: ::rubs face a little bit:: ::tries again:: ::10!::

 renee: ((limit break! =P))
 ek:((XDD Proto-chimhazzard.))
 renee((limit breaks are genetic? =P))
 ek:((Sure, why not?))

AZUMA: *is pwned* Very good. I am proud of you.
KATRIN: ::smiles:: ... ... ::hug::
AZUMA: *hug*
KATRIN: I really miss you. :< 
AZUMA: I miss you as well. Surprising considering how much I complained about all the noise you made.
KATRIN: Whups. ^^
AZUMA: *smiles*
KATRIN: Oh yeah...your nephew, Ukoku, works with us at ShinRa! I almost forgot.
AZUMA: Does he? Interesting. What is he doing these days?
KATRIN: Science crap. :B 
AZUMA: *hrms*
KATRIN: I'm kinda tired from the flight? Mind if I crash?
AZUMA: Not at all. You know where to find your futon.
KATRIN: ::nod::

[KATRIN takes a nap and wakes up in the evening and has TEA with AZUMA and the BOY.  She spends the night and returns to MIDGAR in the MORNING.]

I'm thinking of taking a trip to visit Azuma-sensei in Wutai, but I'll have to be covert about it, what with the war and crap.  I'll be back soon.

"event","So if you look down below you'll see that I won NaNoWriMo. I actually beat it on the 7th day, and I could have kept going but then suddenly stuff happened and I pushed my way to 70k words. In all honestly it ended up being 4 stories, all but about 3 scenes, being all angst. I might post it eventually onto my writing blog, <a href=""megaranoelle.wordpress.com"" target=""_new"">megaranoelle.wordpress.com</a>, but only time will tell about that, I keep writing new things all the time too.<br /><br />Big news though? I'm a radio personality! On the internet! <a href=""theforce925.net"" target=""_new"">TheForce925.net</a>! DJ Megara broadcasting live on air on Mondays/Tuesdays and Saturdays! 9pm (Mon) to 1am (Tues) PT, Midnight to 4am (Tues) ET and 5am to 9am (Tues) GMT! That show will be the Oriental Pop/Rock Block! Playing music from Japan, Korea, China, etc.... It's gonna be awesome. And on Saturday you can catch me 2am to 6am PT, 5am to 9am ET, and 10am to 2pm GMT. But each hour in that show will be the 'Delightfully Intriguing Trivia' segment, where I give you trivia of... intriguing... facts. Anyway, the point is that you should all go and listen to it (Starting Jan 3rd at midnight ET) because it's gonna be awesome, even if you don't listen to my show. We play just about Everything, quite literally.<br /><br />Let's see, what else? Oh yes, I'm hoping to finish by February to finish an afghan I'm working on. The afghan you ask? A totally custom planned Legend of Zelda afghan, old school Zelda too. It's all tunisian crochet, which goes a little bit slower for me, but it's worth it cause you get a crisp look. I was influenced by this <a href=""http://gegecrochet.blogspot.com/2009/03/mario-party-part-2-my-quest.html"" target=""_new"">Mario</a> afghan, which is amazing.

With my luck I'll be way ahead and then I'll keep getting called into work, and that just won't be fun for my wordcount, fun for my bank account though. Also not fun for my wordcount is my goal to find a second job too.

Oh well, back to building a buffer of words before I have to call in and see if I have to work."

"event","Wow, six months later I update. And I guess a lot of stuff has happened, a lot of stressful stuff too. But I think I'll just like glance over most of that stuff and try to focus on the good stuff. First let's glance over bad stressful stuff.

I need to move the hell out, it's getting really bad. I can't find a job, so I have no money. No money is a problem in itself. My family apparently can't do anything without me nearby and free because the rest of my family doesn't want to be reliable.

Good stuff!
I went to World Steam Expo Memorial Day weekend in Dearborn, and apparently there were at least 1000 people there over the 4 day expo. It was AMAZING CRAZY FUN. I made my own costumes, and some costumes for my friend, out of my own patterns. And now I'm selling them on Etsy, VerdelliAshmore. SHAMELESS PLUG!

I will be working at the Michigan Renaissance Festival again, Silverleaf Costumes. Also.... I'll be working at GEN CON!!!! I couldn't be more excited.

My brother and sister-in-law got married on the 12th, and I'm so happy for them. It was a really nice ceremony and they did a wonderful job on the reception and planning.

Annnnnnnnd, I'm taking a break from school, to get my life on track. And right now I'm watching E3 coverage while working on Another novel idea. I think I need to focus on getting one done and submitting it, but I'll get there.

Um.... I can't really remember if there's anything else, but I think I'll try to update more often now, and that includes finishing up some fanfics. I was thinking about those the other night, and I'm gonna get back to those, I promise."

I walked in Friday (the 11th) with a financial aid meeting, and walked out with a class shedule and some papers to for mom to sign, and $12,000 in debt! I'M A STUDENT AT ITT TECHNICAL INSTITUTE!!!!!!! I start classes on Wednesday.

I'm paid up from now until the end of September then I re-apply for my student loans, blah blah. All my books nad tools and fees are included int he tuition, even my cap and gown when I graduate. They make my schedule for me so I'm not taking any classes I don't need, and I still go full time and I'll Know when I'll grdaute. Classes won't cancel, I just tell them my class time preference, and they try to work around that.

I don't have to fill out the FAFSA anymore, cause they'll do it for me, I just give them the info they need to update it, and take out the hassel for me. I'm in the Visual Communications Associates program, and in 8 quarters I'll get that, and when I enter the Bachelor's program I get something like 20% off tuition because I continued at ITT Tech. I'll then enter into the Digital Entertainment and Game Design program.

My schedule looks like this:
Wednesday: Introduction to Deisgn - 9am - 1:20pm
 Strategies for the Technical Professional - 1:30pm - 5:50pm

Thursday: Problem Solving - 9am - 12:24pm

and that's it! I'm so excited. Now I just need a job, maybe somewhere int he middle of my drive, and to move out, and to be able to pay back what I owe on shit, lol. I also need to try and get my teacher to let me take my exam early so I can go to class this Wednesday.... Here's hoping!"

"event","I really don't remember the last time I posted, but here I am. Updates first. I won NaNo by the hair of my chin. It was really frustrating being Co-ML because all of the RL stuff going on at home. Major cleaning overhaul before we face inspection, stress frustrating me to the brink of sanity, and still no job.

I have now pulled out some of the stops looking for a job. I would say all, but I'm not good at playing the name game, or the whole connections thing. I need to move the hell Out. My insurance is killing me, and on Thursday I am apparently going to take a tour of ITT Tech in Flint. Digital Entertainment and Game Design. I have to rethink my classes at Delta, but I dunno anymore. This is the program I've been looking for honestly, and now that I have backups I know what I'm finally gonna do, and it all revolves around computers. Yay!

I had planned on moving to Baltimore but with this degree I'm going for who knows if I'll get a job out there. If I still really wanted to I could move out there, because there is a campus 30 minutes away from Baltimore, about the same distance from where I am right now. Bah!

Life is kicking me in the ass royally lately, and it's getting old. I just need something to help me out at ITT Tech. Maybe without the constant bad luck that's been thrown at me lately Ill be able to get my shit together and get everything on track..... Hopefully."

"event","So NaNoWriMo rapidly approaches&nbsp;(not fast enough if you ask me) and I find that this year I have my idea already and I'm actually having trouble trying to Stop myself from writing it. Once again I'm doing fanficton. I'm also Co-ML of the Tri-Cities and just had a blitz with my other ML and we think we're set for NaNo, mostly. Even set up a twitter account for it. But what I find myself really wanting to do is write a bunch of prequels to set up my story, and technically it wouldn't be breaking NaNo's rules.

So let's see, I'm Co-ML, and I've still got..... thre? CSI&nbsp;Miami fanfics to work on and finish, and I want to start come NCIS fanfic. I do already have another NCIS fanfic started on another site. Then I signed up for an NCIS contest thingy.... and I'm considering another FanFic challenge. This is of course topped with my classes and getting a new car, and finding a job, and getting money, and finding a way to move out come New Years. And waiting for the news that my cousin had her baby, and my nephew's first birthday in a couple days.

I'm pretty sure that I can add some more stress to all this, no problem. I'm pretty sure that not too long after writing this I will be working on my fanfics, because it's been a while since I've just typed and I need to get back into that habit before NaNo starts or I will fail, and I can't do that! Not when I won this year. Last year started my winning streak.

If you couldn't tell I like getting involved in large group things. I'm a paradox.

Also still waiting to her from the boy, although he did get friendly with me last week, in a good way that made me feel really good. I need more of that.... And my family isn't really supportive of anything that I wanna do and it's pissing me off. They don't like to talk about things, and I do. Rwarg family!"

We were inseparable for almost ten years.&rdquo; After hearing about how Ryan was never able to make to Eric&rsquo;s graduation party Josh had been asking all sorts of questions about the Cuban.<br /><br />&ldquo;Exactly, you have to have some kind of favorite moment, a memory if you will.&rdquo; Josh glanced up at the younger boy who would be a senior with him when the year started in three days. &ldquo;I know you haven&rsquo;t been pining over this man for all these years and not have a memory of him that you cherish.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Ryan lifted his head slightly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been pining over him for years.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you only discovered that you were pining over him less than a year ago,&rdquo; Josh rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Now, spill.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan grunted then shrugged slightly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I guess it was maybe when I was seven. I had been living in Miami for about a year.&rdquo; A small smile started to form across Ryan&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;I still hadn&rsquo;t made a lot of friends so I had no one to invite over for a party for my birthday, it as just going to be a family party.&rdquo;<br /><br />Josh raised an eyebrow as Ryan told his story, not quite seeing where Eric was in the tale. &ldquo;My little brother had better luck making friends then I ever did, and probably still do.

With his past catching up with him and Eric along for the ride, getting home seems harder by the minute. But what other mysteries must Ryan uncover while in this alternate reality? What exactly is Kendrel's secret and how does it affect Ryan?<br />A/N: I know! Long time! Things come up, chapters disappear, school and lack of job, but here's the ... second to last chapter I do believe.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Eric had fallen asleep..."">Chapter 7<br /><br />Eric had fallen asleep in the chair next to Calleigh as they waited for the doctor to finish checking Ryan's eye. Several hours after arriving at the hospital, Eric had been cleared as being healthy, if a bit sleep-deprived. The nurses had eyed the group suspiciously when no one could give a straight answer as to why they were there.<br /><br />Ryan sat at the end of the bed as the doctor retrieved the new meds that he would have to take. He wasn't sure what he would tell the others, but not the truth; he didn't want any pity or help from the others.<br /><br />After cleaning around his eyes, the doctor had asked him how he had injured his eye. Ryan quickly made up a story about how he had taken a sliver of wood to the eye as part of his job. Ryan said that he was a police officer from Boston, and had become involved in a shootout nearby when a stray bullet splintered some wood and he had been standing too close.<br /><br />Several tests, a MRI, and a X-ray later the doctor told him that he probably wouldn't recover sight in his right eye. He would have to stay on his meds for a month or two to fight off infection so that he wouldn't become completely blind.<br /><br />&ldquo;Alright, Mr. Delko,&rdquo; Ryan looked up as the doctor returned with two bottles. Since Ryan Wolfe didn't exist, they had claimed that Ryan was Eric's brother. &ldquo;You'll need to take both of these twice a day for three weeks, and then I want you to see an optometrist.&rdquo; Ryan nodded, taking the bottles. &ldquo;I'll send over your files whenever you go, and if they feel you need to continue your medications, you can just get a refill.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan nodded again, took the bottles from the Doctor's offered hand and slipped off of the examination table. &ldquo;Am I free to go then?&rdquo; All he really wanted to do was go to sleep.<br /><br />&ldquo;Just remember to change your bandage twice a day, and you're all set.&rdquo; Ryan shook the doctor's hand and walked out of the room to where the others were waiting. Kendrel was the first one to notice Ryan walking down the hall and was up before the other three knew what was happening. Calleigh nudged Eric's arm, waking him up from his uncomfortable position in his chair.<br /><br />&ldquo;Alright, so what's the diagnosis?&rdquo; Kendrel didn't mince words. She wanted the facts, and she wanted them now. &ldquo;How much longer am I going to have to take care of you?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You don't have to take care of me, Kandy,&rdquo; Ryan rolled his uncovered eye and shook his head slightly. He waited until his other companions came over before he relayed the doctor's orders. &ldquo;I have to take these pills, and change the bandage, and I should be fine.&rdquo; He had made up his mind not to tell them the whole story.<br /><br />&ldquo;That's it?&rdquo; Calleigh raised an eyebrow at the brunette.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, they're to fight off infection. He wants me to go see an eye doctor, but that probably won't happen.&rdquo; He shrugged one shoulder and chuckled slightly. &ldquo;I don't want many more people thinking that a Ryan Delko exists.&rdquo;<br /><br />Kendrel snorted and smirked. &ldquo;Yeah, isn't one Delko bad enough?&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric shot a look at Kendrel then moved forward, a little hesitantly, and put an arm around Ryan&rsquo;s shoulders. He could see that the younger man really just wanted to go home and sleep. Ryan flashed a small smile at Eric. &ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll take you back to your place.&rdquo; Eric suggested and he could see the relief fill Ryan&rsquo;s eye.<br /><br />&ldquo;We should get back to the house, too,&rdquo; Horatio said, standing next to Calleigh.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, and I&rsquo;ll call some kind of cleaning crew to get started on your apartment,&rdquo; Kendrel offered to Eric. Eric only grimaced, and shook his head, leading Ryan towards the exit. When they were safely in Eric&rsquo;s car with no one else around, Eric&rsquo;s fingers intertwined themselves with Ryan&rsquo;s.<br /><br />&ldquo;Are you really okay?&rdquo; He asked as he started to car. Ryan sighed slightly, looking out the window with his one eye and nodded.<br />&ldquo;I just want this all to be over,&rdquo; Ryan said quietly. Eric nodded and took off for the highway back to Ryan&rsquo;s complex. They rode in a comfortable silence, both men thinking.<br /><br />As they walked into the elevator at Ryan&rsquo;s building, Ryan turned his head to look up at Eric. He scrunched his forehead together in thought and let out a breath through his nose. Eric looked at Ryan and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Are you sure you want to go out with me?&rdquo;<br />Eric blinked, now it was his turn to be caught off-guard. &ldquo;What? Where is this coming from?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I just mean, I&rsquo;m not normal, in any way.&rdquo; Ryan stepped off the elevator once the doors opened to his floor, leaving Eric to follow behind him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always being attacked, hurt, and on top of that I&rsquo;m OCD.&rdquo; He pulled out his keys to open his apartment door, leaving it open for Eric, too. Puff ran around the corner and started to twine herself between her master&rsquo;s legs. &ldquo;I just think that you would be happier taking out some other, normal, guy or girl.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;If I had wanted normal I would already be going out with someone,&rdquo; Eric said pointedly as he closed and locked Ryan&rsquo;s front door. &ldquo;When you came here, you had this strange aura around you that I just couldn&rsquo;t help but be drawn to you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan sighed slightly as he walked into the kitchen to give Puff some fresh water. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Eric, I just think that we both should think about it a little more.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not backing out on the date are you?&rdquo; Eric moved closer to the younger man and took his arm gently in his hand. Ryan turned to look into Eric&rsquo;s eyes, and shook his head after a second.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m just saying, let&rsquo;s not rush into this.&rdquo; Eric mentally sighed in relief. &ldquo;You never know what&rsquo;s gonna pop up and make you change your mind.&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric chuckled lightly and shook his head. &ldquo;Come on you, doctor told you to get some rest.&rdquo; He started to guide Ryan to the bedroom. &ldquo;Tomorrow morning I&rsquo;ll go out and get us breakfast while you sleep, and get you some more bandages for your eye.&rdquo; Ryan nodded as they walked into his bedroom. He could feel the exhaustion settling into his bones and felt that he could fall asleep on his feet.<br /><br />Eric helped him undress, folding his clothes and putting them on a chair and left so Ryan could change into his pajama&rsquo;s, trying to give him some privacy. He wondered if he would be sleeping in the bed with Ryan once again, or if he should just tough it out on the couch. After a few minutes his question was answered as Ryan opened the door and beckoned Eric inside.<br /><br />He quickly changed into an extra pair of sweats that Ryan had handed him and slipped under the blanket, next to Ryan, shirtless. Ryan was practically asleep before he had even gotten into the bed, and instantly turned into the warmth that Eric&rsquo;s body gave off.<br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br />Ryan slowly opened his eye when the bright afternoon sun peeked in through his window. He groaned and buried his head into his pillow, but eventually lifted his head back up. He yawned and sat up slowly and looked around, trying to remember where he was. Everything came back to him and he looked around for Eric, but remembered that the Cuban-Russian had said that he was going to get breakfast.<br /><br />He sat up slowly and stretched his arm, feeling a slightly stiffness from the bandage that was over his eye. Ryan shuffled into the bathroom and noticed the medication and bandage supplies laid out on the sink counter. Ryan smiled gently, knowing that Eric had done that for him, and even his OCD was pacified for a short time.<br /><br />After taking his pills, grabbing a quick shower and changing his clothes and bandage, he could smell the food from the kitchen of his apartment. He walked out and saw the back of Eric&rsquo;s body in the kitchen standing over the stove.<br /><br />&ldquo;Eric, that smells good already.&rdquo; He smiled as he got closer. &ldquo;But then again, it has been days since we had real food.&rdquo; A small shiver ran down Ryan&rsquo;s spine, but he shook it off.<br /><br />Ryan&rsquo;s gut told him to stop before he got too much closer and he looked around the kitchen. Some of the drawers were open, but Ryan didn&rsquo;t notice any plates, or food, or anything else sitting out on the counters. He looked at Eric closely and took a tentative step forward. Suddenly Eric spun on his heel and lashed out at Ryan with a knife in his hand.<br /><br />Ryan&rsquo;s eyes widened and jumped back as the knife made a small slice in his t-shirt. He stared at Eric as his breathing start to quicken. He scrambled backwards quickly as Eric walked towards with an uncharacteristically sinister smirk on his face.<br /><br />&ldquo;Eric! What the- omph!&rdquo; Ryan almost fell forward when he backed into something sturdy and yet soft at the same time. He turned around and felt his eyes widen even more. Ryan felt like he was looking into a distorted mirror. Standing in front of him was,&hellip; himself. Only there was no bandage over his damaged right eye, and this Ryan&rsquo;s eyes were an unnatural gold.<br /><br />Ryan&rsquo;s double smirked and then his hand lashed out and caught the real Ryan around his throat, lifting him up off of the ground a few inches. <br /><br />&ldquo;Sorry, my Delko likes violence a little too much for his own good.&rdquo; Ryan was surprised to hear his own voice coming out of the double&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to kill you yet, we owe our existence to you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan wanted to ask what he meant, what was happening, but could only gasp for air and scratch at the arm that was holding him in the air. Ryan kicked up his leg, hoping to get enough air, and landed a blow to his double&rsquo;s shoulder. His grip faltered and Ryan was able to wrench his neck out of the vice-like grip.<br /><br />He toppled to the floor but quickly got to his feet and ran towards the front door. Throwing the door open he ran into the hallway of his apartment, hoping to make it outside where he would be able to find one of his friends, because who really would help someone who claimed that his double was trying to kill him? Before he could make it too far, though, he was tackled to the ground and felt the cool, sharp, metal of his kitchen knife being held to his throat.<br /><br />&ldquo;That was a mistake,&rdquo; he heard Eric&rsquo;s voice hiss by his ear. Ryan didn&rsquo;t say anything but saw a pair of feet walk into his line of vision. Glancing up he saw his double standing there, only this time there was a bandage covering his eye.<br /><br />&ldquo;Think you can keep him quiet for a few hours?&rdquo; He felt the nod of the body on top of him and the Ryan&rsquo;s double smirked at him. &ldquo;Good, I&rsquo;ve got an errand to run, and it would be so sad if he were to ruin the surprise.&rdquo; He smirked once more and Ryan watched as his doppelganger walked over to the elevator and pressed the down button.<br /><br />The Eric copy roughly pulled Ryan to his feet, carefully keeping the knife poised over his exposed throat, and pushed him back towards his apartment. <br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have some fun of our own.&rdquo; Ryan shivered at the voice and closed his eyes briefly.<br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br />Eric locked the door to his apartment and threw his duffel bag over his shoulder. It was going to take at least two days to clean up the mess that was in there, and he needed a few changes of clothes if he was going to be staying at Ryan&rsquo;s to watch over him. Maybe if Ryan was feeling better they could come over and start on his apartment later today or tomorrow.<br /><br />He smirked to himself as he walked to the elevator, remembering the innocent look that was on Ryan&rsquo;s face as he slept that morning. He hoped that he was able to wake up to that more often and that Ryan would give their budding interests a chance to grow.<br /><br />As the elevator doors opened, Eric was surprised to see Ryan already standing inside. <br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, you,&rdquo; Eric smiled as Ryan stepped out and the doors shut. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be sleeping you know. I told you that I would bring you breakfast.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know, but I woke up and you weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Ryan smiled at him slightly, almost shyly, and started to walk down the hall to Eric&rsquo;s apartment, beckoning him to follow. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find my cell phone and I think that I left it in your apartment. Could we go in and check?&rdquo;<br />Eric blinked a little but nodded and pulled out his keys. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long you&rsquo;ll be able to stand being in there, it&rsquo;s really dirty.&rdquo; Eric warned as he unlocked the door, holding it open for Ryan. The brunette walked in but took no notice of the destruction that had transpired. He headed straight for the bedroom and looked around. Eric stood behind him as Ryan put one hand on his hip and sighed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; Eric moved closer, dropping his bag on the bed, giving a glance for Ryan&rsquo;s cell phone.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think that you should stay here, Eric,&rdquo; Ryan&rsquo;s answer surprised the Cuban-Russian.<br /><br />&ldquo;I thought we had decided that I was going to stay with you&hellip;,&rdquo; Eric trailed off when he turned to face Ryan, the bandage gone from his face and he was holding onto the lamp from Eric&rsquo;s bedside table. &ldquo;Ryan?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, when I said think, I was really insisting.&rdquo; Ryan swung his arms towards Eric&rsquo;s head, the lamp connecting with his skull before Eric could make a move. Eric gasped as he fell to the ground, the edges of his vision becoming fuzzy. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think this is going to work out between us,&rdquo; he heard the malice laced voice of Ryan faintly. <br /><br />His brain worked slowly, deciding that that was not the Ryan he had woken up to this morning. He was vaguely aware of his surroundings moving as his vision started to dim, unconsciousness creeping over him. He swore he saw a smile and a pair of golden eyes spark at him before darkness claimed him.</lj-cut><br />"

I'm looking for readers, and editors. I already have a list started, but I'm looking to add to that list of people who would like to read it and tell me what they think, of people who would like to edit it, or do both. I need like another 2 or 3 Readers, and another 2 editors.

Her name was the only thing she remembered after the storm; Ayala Audra Montegrove. Ayala doesn't even remember being caught in the storm that destroyed her home and memories. Now, almost 15 years later, answers start showing up, answers to questions she hadn't asked.
Being part of the slowly growing, and discriminated against magikal community doesn't help in her search for the truth. Her world is about to be turned upside down, to the left right, and done all over again. And Ayala thoguht her destiny was to be a newspaper columnist and freelance writer. Oh, how very wrong she was. Her life is about to include the rest of the world.

There's a bad summary, lol. So go ahead and leave a comment with your email in it. And around the last week in July I'll be sending out some emails, and blah di blah. In&lt;3 you all!"

"event","Life update here! Still working on my novel BUT, it's a different one. It's the one i did for NaNo last year,a nd then tragically lost when my thumbs drive died (still waiting for that mental breakdown to happen). I'm retyping it, I found a copy of it, a paper physical copy, and I have the Writer's Market 2010, so here's to hoping.

Now I had planned that after this next year at Delta, I would get me a nifty internship at a Video Game company, move, blah blah, but that whole issue of ""Shit, I still can't find a job in the third worst place in Michaigan for employment"" and not being able to afford anything if I moved kept popping up. And a few other issues that have popped up because of the jobless thing that prevent me from doing a few things. So I came up with a plan! It's fleshed out, and I'm still working on it, but here it is so far.

I'm fucking moving to San Francisco! I'm gonna finish up a Fall, Winter and Spring semester at Delta, while hopefully having found some way to make money. When i get ready to go down there (technically it's over and down, but I'm saying down) I'm going to sell my car, my baby, Trent. Cause San Francisco, Ripe with public transportation. I'm going to find someone to live with, unless someone wants to move with me. Two reason i would not be able to afford a place by myself, expensive shit, and one of those little issues I mentioned before prevents me from getting a credit check.

As soon as I have someplace to live, I'm going to put in every online application to like Every place near my new place, then when i get down there I'm going to put in every Paper application. But the plan is to take care of one of aforementioned issues so I can get a loan, and have enough money saved up that I can pay for 2 to 3 months of rents and stuff sans-job.

The cats are gonna be tricky. Pudge is so loyal to me, but I would feel bad taking her away from here, because she loves mom too, and Egypt (don't know why), and I'm not sure at all about Bella. Mom would say take her with me, but that's nothing to worry about right now. The main point is that I need to get The Fuck Out Of Saginaw! Out Of Michigan!

The Goal is to be moving 3 years from now, max. The Dream, is to move in a year and a half from now. I wanna be turning 25 in California. I wanna be a Fag hag to so many Gay Men that I can't keep track of them. (The Sis-In-Law and I noticed that I attract gay men like no other, and I welcome the extra friends!) I wanna be able to leave my place when I wanna write or read and walk someplace that's nice and what I was looking for. I wanna find a fucking guy! Find my guy, then my life will start to slip into place, and I can fucking get the plans together for having my damn kids! (I might even lose my virginity *gasp*)

This is what I call my Leap of Faith (LoF) or my ""I said , 'What the hell!'"" moment. Nothing worth having if you're not willing to take a risk for it. And the worst that happens? I don't have a job/lose it, run out of money and have to come back home to mom to get back on my feet. I can deal with that, because I know my mom will say ""I told you so. Come on in.""

So that is the start of my plan, I've already started research, in fact it took two days or research to decide on Where I wanted to move. Also, I know I didn't mention school in there, because I effectively have to push ""pause"" on school until I can afford it. Cause after this year, I'm fucked. But that is my plan, I will do it, because I Have to. For my own sanity."

"event","So surfing around the net yesterday and I manage to come across the Penguin Publishing site, and I notice that DAW Books (part of Penguin) is accepting manuscripts, more importantly, unsolicited manuscripts! They publish exclusively Fantasy and Sci-Fi, so imagine how excited I was! Then I remember that I lost two my two previous novels and are still still working on getting myself to revisit those extensively, but I have antoher novel started. So I'm currently working on that.

I was asked for a synopsis on Facebook, and I managed to come up with this, I'm really bad at coming up with that kidn of stuff. It's set in it's own world, of which I had to create from scratch.

Those gifted with Magic either have the Combat, Enchantment, of Diversion Expertise (Class). It is nigh rare that any person would have two, or all three, Expertise's, except for One every Millennium. An ancient evil that ended the Royal line is back to search for the missing Tri-Expertise One. But what's so important about this One person? And why does this Evil want them?

Not the classic I want to rule the world novel, I'm trying to make it Not cliche, and so far my Beta says that it sounds good without being like that, so.

When I get more writte out I might post it somewhere, or I'll just email it to people who wanna read it. I've already got Holly down as one of the first, but anyone let me know, drop a comment with your email or send me a message if you don't want everyone seeing your email, :P.

Here's an excerpt!

**
Aulare&rsquo;s recorded history started over 120,000 years, Twelve Aelams, ago, but there have been very few instances that have memorable. Two instances to be exact. War is an inevitable thing and in the end no is truly surprised that it happens. What the people want to know about, what they want to remember, are the truly remarkable accounts.

It was during the Seventh Aelas that the first event occurred. The Royal Rashiort line was ended in the year 5754. Guards discovered the slaughtered bodies of the Royal family on the thirty-seventh day of the seventh month in the Grand Library. Master Holar Barqis raised the alarm early in the Morning hours. He was to deliver the names of the students from Aulare&rsquo;s Expertise Academy that were to become members of the Royal Guard to the King. Shortly afterwards Master Holar vanished.

I'm taking two Spring classes, Deisgn 1 and Color Photography, these classes will be taking up a lot of my time for the next 6 weeks. I am still working on my fanfics, in fact i hope to next week have an update for my 100 Ryan/Eric stories.

I can regal you now with chapter one of a new NCIS fic, well in the next few days. I like being involved in communities and all of that, so i gotta get that all sorted out.

Speaking of being involved! I am now one of the Authors for a new blog, MikeWeatherly.com . Michael Weatherly is an actor, mostly known for playing Anthony DiNozzo on NCIS, but he also does movies, much like he is filming a movie right now. It was just published online a few days ago, and we're working on great things, you should all go over and check it out.

//EDIT
Word just came in, Michael Weatherly has been notified of the site! Put it in his Twitter. Big advancements for the Blog that has like 4 or 5 Authors, lol. We may be able to get things rolling now! Woot!

Now I'm off to finish the second half of my Design homework, aka getting high off of marker fumes. My nose does not thank me."

"event","I have just experienced one of the most terrible things to ever happen to me. My beautiful, awesome, 8gig thumb drive, just died. It had over 5 gigs of information on it, 4 years, or more, worth of stuff. All of my documents, all of my pictures, everything, Gone. All of my homework, all of my ideas, My Novels! Gone! Really the only things I have left are my music, which made it over to my Mac, and some unrelated Photoshop items that I was messing around with.

The Story:
I was about to open my Photoshop homework, a huge project that is due Tomorrow, Before class, and I reached for a wire or something. My drive was plugged into my USB&nbsp;Hub, (because I have a lot of things to plug in, I'm techy nerd), and I moved the hub and the light goes out, and I get an error on my screen. Now thinking that it just came lose or something I took it out and plugged it back in. Nothing. I plugged it into a different port. Nothing. I took it out, wiggled it around, because I've had problems with others where it just came loose. Nothing. Plugged it into mom's laptop, Nothing. Mine, Nothing. At this point, I am freaking the fuck Out. It's a Geek Squad brand USB, so I figure I'll take ot down to Best Buy, pay whatever I have to for them to do their thing and get my information. Money that I don't really have....

So I go down there, I don't have to wait long, and I hand over my thumb drive to the nice guy and explain what happens. &quot;Oh,&quot; his tone of voice isn't very confidence building. He tests it two computer, 4 different ports. Nothing. &quot;I think it might be dead. I hope you didn't have anything important on there.&quot;
&quot;Just my life.&quot;
&quot;Oooooo.&quot;

The female walks over and asks what;s happening and we explain. &quot;My dad sent his drive out to have the data recovered and he spent crazy money. Six grand, and he didn't get everything back.&quot;

At this point, it's taking a shit ton of control to not break down crying in front of Geek Squad, and Best Buy.&nbsp;I've just been told that I lost my entire life, that everything on that little stick, is Gone. The nice guy then tells me that he's lost 3 thumb drives to one computer because it decided to shock them, and kill them, and he now owns 9 external hard drives. I then asked the man seriously if I should consider getting a hard drive. He told me, Yes.

&quot;There's good news nad bad news. The bad news you know, your thumb drive is dead. The good news, you get a replacement for free.&quot;

So I am the owner of a brand new 8gig thumb drive, and a 250 gig external hard drive. As of right now, the thumb drive is for transporting long distances, and the Hard Drive gets EVERYTHING.

I'll be able to recover most of my fanfiction work because I've posted it on the internet somewhere. I'll be able to recover half of one of my novels, the undedited version of it. I'll be able to recover a Tiny Percentage of my pictures from the stuff that I've uploaded on deviantArt.

I don't know how I'm functioning right now, but I'm sure that alter tongiht or tomorrow it'll all kick in. Things don't really sink in for me unti la few days after it's happened, my brain doesn't want to except what's happened, works the same way when someone dies. Right now I just need to get my Photoshop homework back on track, that's what's keeping me from freaking out. Probably tomorrow, During Photoshop class I'll freak out, and most likely cry. Yay Me."

He looked around his backyard and noticed that there were still a lot of people populating his house but knew that most of them were his family. They would leave once all the food had been devoured or packed away, and maybe when the sun rose tomorrow. He tried to keep the frown off of his face when he didn&rsquo;t see the person he had been looking for all day.<br /><br />Eric practically jumped when he felt someone tap his shoulder from behind. He turned around and blinked when he saw a familiar face.<br /><br />&ldquo;Congratulations, Eric,&rdquo; Eric smiled and shook Ron Wolfe&rsquo;s hand. He handed the Cuban-Russian a wrapped box that had impeccable handwriting on the front.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you, Mr Wolfe.&rdquo; Eric hid the disappointment that it wasn&rsquo;t the right Wolfe he had wanted to see. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still some food if you wanted to eat something.&rdquo; Eric motioned over to the table that was still crowded with his family. &ldquo;My Mama will be more than happy to make up a plate for you to take home.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ron chuckled and smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to get that plate. I come with a message actually. That gift is actually from Ryan.&rdquo; Eric blinked and looked closely at the writing. &ldquo;He was going to come with me, or rather I was going to come with him, but his plane got delayed in Boston.&rdquo; Ron gave Eric a soft smile as the young graduate was still looking at the handwriting on the present. &ldquo;I should know, I was the one who helped him buy his ticket.&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric felt the corners of his mouth tug up in a slight smile as he clearly recognized the neat handwriting of his OCD best friend. He looked back up at Ron and nodded his thanks. &ldquo;Um, come on,&rdquo; he regained a sense of conversation. &ldquo;My Mama will be happy to see you again.&rdquo; Ron chuckled and nodded, clapping Eric on the shoulder and following the young man over to his enthusiastic mother.<br /><br />Eric grinned later that night as he sat on his bed, staring at the box that was in front of him. He remembered the Detective&rsquo;s kit he had gotten Ryan for his birthday all those years ago, and clearly so did Ryan. Sitting in front of Eric&rsquo;s folded legs, wrapping paper not to far behind, was a &lsquo;My First Chemistry Set.&rsquo; <br /><br />And according to the note, Ryan had suped this kit up. He had added some extra test tubes and beakers, and even a finger-printing kit. Eric grabbed the box and got up putting it on his book-shelf. He was going to set it up the next day, but wanted it in a safe spot while he slept.<br /><br />When his cell phone rang he practically jumped on it so it wouldn&rsquo;t wake his parents. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Did you get my present?&rdquo; Eric grinned, hearing the voice he had waited for all day.<br /><br />&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; Ryan laughed and Eric could imagine the younger teen shaking his head with a grin.<br /><br />&ldquo;I just knew. It&rsquo;s what close friends like us do.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Eric grinned as he settled himself down on his bed, knowing they were going to talk all night long.</lj-cut><br />"

Josh was still amazed at times that Ryan gave up having friends to be friends with him. Now that both were seen hanging out with each other, they were outcasts among the other students.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is the letter I've been waiting for,&rdquo; Ryan announced as he walked into the room. Josh glanced up from his bed, not closing the book that sat in his lap. &ldquo;It's from Eric.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Your Miami Eric, right?&rdquo; Josh smirked slightly at how excited Ryan got every time he got a letter from his friend. The school had started blocking their internet access and the two had been forced to start writing letters again.<br /><br />Ryan grabbed the letter opener on his exceptionally organized desk and opened the letter. He pulled out the letter and two other smaller things fell out onto his desk. Josh slid off of his bed and picked up the two papers while Ryan read the written letter.<br /><br />One was an invitation for Eric's Graduation Party in the summer. It seemed that the invitation was printed professionally but he could see that the man had put his own Latin flair in the decoration.<br /><br />Josh turned over the other object in his hand and raised an eyebrow at the senior picture in his hand. If this was the man that Ryan was friends with in Miami, he could see why the boy thought he was gay. Eric was gorgeous. His closely cropped black hair, and the tan skin, and his caramel eyes that Josh thought he would melt into. He was in a relaxed position, sitting on the sill of what appeared to be a large stone window in a church.<br /><br />&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; Josh muttered and started to dramatically fan himself with the invitation. Ryan glanced over and snatched the invitation and picture from his roommate. &ldquo;I wanna do this man, now.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, back off. He's a total ladies man anyway,&rdquo; Ryan plopped down in his chair, looking over the invitation.<br /><br />&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t mean that he's not into guys, too.&rdquo; Ryan looked at Josh and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Bi?&rdquo; Ryan raised his other eyebrow this time. &ldquo;Oh, my poor innocent, naive little boy. You've been taught nothing of the world.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I lived in Miami for eight years!&rdquo; Ryan exclaimed. &ldquo;You were either gay or straight.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;There's oh so much more to sexuality.&rdquo; Josh pulled his chair over in front of Ryan and sat down. &ldquo;He could be bisexual, and likes both guys and girls. There's obviously more to it than that, but it'll take a while to explain. You are my new life project my friend.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan rolled his eyes and glanced at the picture of Eric. &ldquo;I wouldn't know then, we don't really talk about stuff like that.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, when you lived with him didn't you get any sense of who he was interested in? Or how he reacted to other gays?&rdquo; Josh often thought that his roommate was too innocent for the world.<br /><br />&ldquo;No? Not really,...&rdquo; Ryan trailed off.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don't worry about it, we'll figure things out. It'll give you the drive to get back to Miami, so you can kiss those soft gorgeous lips.&rdquo; Josh leaned over to look at the picture one more time. &ldquo;He's almost to hot to function. How has he not been mauled by everyone on the earth?&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan snorted and pushed Josh's shoulders, smirking. &ldquo;You're so horny.&rdquo;<br /><br />Josh grinned. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

"event",".... to have a sad and angry post at the same time? They kind of mesh together int he middle, and isn't that really all one needs to make something seem like one? Applies to Art too, which could lead me to one, not the most prominant, of the issues at hand.

I've found myself taking a hard look at school, and my schooling and choices in particular. I find the thought swimming around more than i would like of I don't want to be there. And more recently I've found myself questioning my major choice.... again.

Fair warning, it's that time of year, I'm going to be vague, and probably not explain everything that I'm thinking. And I can tell you Why I'll do that! Because it's a sign of weakness, failure, SOMETHING, to explain this to everyone. Example, everyone please count how many time you've seen me cry. I can bet that most of you will never get past the number 2, if you even get a number. And I'll tell you if you're right or wrong.

I've found that I need to purge my life every so often, and that time is coming once again. I'd like to be in charge of it this time. Slowly but surely I find that I am surrounding myself with the people that I need to be around, the ones that help me, that help me grow and learn to do things that have been locked away for far too damn long. But I'm still left with an ache, and longing, that I just can't figure out why it's like that. It hurts dammit.

Also, another warning, although these all mesh I'm just typing what comes to mind, no particular order. Again, Vague.

Something that has always bugged comes out, not for the first time, but I'll be a little less vague than I usually am about it. STOP FUCKING DOUBTING ME.
That help?
I am sick and fucking tired of people telling me that I don't understand, that I don't know what's involved, that it takes a lot of this, a lot of that. Listen, unless it's something that someone usually doesn't encounter in everyday life, or some extraordinary task that isn't common, I know what the fuck I'm doing! <b>I'm not a fucking child!</b>

This I will explain, because I feel the most passionate about this.

I grow up way too fucking fast for my own good. I was a very independent child, and still am to an extent. I was doing shit in my young age that I would have just started doing now, or understanding things in elementary school that should have been saved for Fucking High School. Consider this my time that I'm catching up on what I missed, I know it doesn't work, but you can't fucking change me. And if you can change me, then you're one that is probably meant to fill my ache.

Growing up as an only child, single parent household, will do all of that to a child. I'm not gonna say that I wasn't a spoiled only child, but I wasn't like everyone thinks. Of course my mother spoiled me, I was, still am, her <i>only child</i>, but I didn't get whatever I wanted.

I know it's not healthy for me, but I really don't and can't care. I have to engross myself in the stories that I read and write. And I say it's not healthy, because for me it's not, I am only left with emptiness. I've known this since I was maybe 11, or maybe younger. I've tried explaining it, and people either say, Oh I understand, or just write it off as an overactive imagination. Um, no, to both. You Don't understand, or connect, or anything. Trust Me.

I feel that if I go on any further, then the men with the white jacket are going to come. I seriously need to be on some sort of drugs. I just want all the pain to go away.... all of it.... 

Please."

With his past catching up with him and Eric along for the ride, getting home seems harder by the minute. But what other mysteries must Ryan uncover while in this alternate reality? What exactly is Kendrel's secret and how does it affect Ryan?<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Chapter 6!"">Chapter 6<br /><br />Horatio suddenly sat up with a book in his hand, a slightly triumphant look on his face. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve found something.&rdquo; Kendrel had been trying to take a nap while Calleigh was waiting for a response from the boys.<br /><br />&ldquo;Is it some way to get them back into this world and awake?&rdquo; Kendrel looked out the window and noticed that morning was slowly coming again. She had about one more day before she would have to start calling into work for Eric.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think so, but I&rsquo;m not sure. If Calleigh&rsquo;s method of communication works, I might be able to get them out.&rdquo; Horatio skimmed over the words with his finger, double checking his thought process. &ldquo;The boys will have to recite this incantation themselves though.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;So this whole theory rests solely on the hunch of Calleigh&rsquo;s notes?&rdquo; Kendrel did not sound convinced, or very enthusiastic about the plan. And as if almost on cue, Calleigh sat up and quickly reached over to Ryan&rsquo;s front pocket. She lifted out pieces of paper and began to unfold them.<br /><br />&ldquo;Are you sure that it&rsquo;s not the same note that you wrote to the boys?&rdquo; Kendrel leaned on the windowsill and watched the blonde read quickly through the notes.<br /><br />&ldquo;Positive. It&rsquo;s from Eric,&rdquo; she held the note up triumphantly. &ldquo;He says they&rsquo;re alright for now, and that Ryan&rsquo;s eye isn&rsquo;t looking any worse on their end. He also says that they&rsquo;ve had a run-in with a demon.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What demon?&rdquo; Kendrel sat up, suddenly taking interest in the note. &ldquo;Does it have a name?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Praxon?&rdquo; Calleigh looked up from the note, wondering she had even pronounced the name right. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;<br /><br />Kendrel ignored her question and looked at Horatio, standing up. &ldquo;We need to get them out of there now. Get that incantation written down,&rdquo; she then turned her attention to Calleigh, &ldquo;and get it to them as fast as possible.&rdquo;<br /><br />Calleigh glanced back at Horatio and blinked. Horatio caught her look and relayed their thoughts. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big rush? Who&rsquo;s Praxon?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Your biggest fear if you don&rsquo;t work fast!&rdquo; Kendrel quickly walked out of the room when she heard a knock at the front door. Calleigh shrugged and Horatio set about writing down the incantation for the boys.<br /><br />Kendrel practically flung Eric&rsquo;s front door open and growled when she didn&rsquo;t see anyone there. There was no note or anything else that someone could have dropped off at the door. Her eyes narrowed slightly and they glowed in her annoyance. Just when she got some bad news, some little punk had to go and play this joke. As she shut the door, she was pushed to the ground and a foot was placed on her chest heavily to keep her down.<br /><br />She growled and looked up to see the same shadowed man from before. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you just die?!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Because, I&rsquo;ve come for my own revenge now,&rdquo; he hissed at her and Kendrel was temporarily shocked that he had actually talked back to her this time. &ldquo;I was sent to do a job, and you,&rdquo; he pushed down harder on her chest with his foot, &ldquo;just keep getting in my damn way.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re really going to hate me now,&rdquo; she smirked and pushed her hands up, a shock force pushing the man off of her and crashing into the couch. Kendrel quickly pushed herself back up, legs propelling her forward before the Shadow could get back up.<br /><br />&ldquo;So I pissed you off enough that you felt the need to come and get revenge, huh?&rdquo; Kendrel smirked slightly. It had been a while since she had made someone that mad. This time it was her turn to step on his chest. She then flopped down in one fluid motion to sit on top of his chest, legs crossed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of touched.&quot;<br /><br />&ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; he growled and grabbed her arms, flipping her back into the wall. &ldquo;Although, I wouldn&rsquo;t lament being rid of you.&rdquo; Kendrel caught herself before she crashed head first into the wall, and both stood, facing each other, neither making a move.<br /><br />&ldquo;Then, what the hell are you doing here?&rdquo; It seemed that there was an unspoken agreement to talk before they went back at trying to kill each other.<br /><br />&ldquo;To kill that idiotic cop in there, that you seem so keen on protecting.&rdquo; The Shadow rolled his eyes, as if Kendrel should have known that answer. &ldquo;I have my own personal vendetta.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The why did you attack Eric?&rdquo; She could hear Ryan&rsquo;s voice in her head already denying the fact that he was a cop.<br /><br />&ldquo;Eric is the one I&rsquo;m trying to kill. God, are you just that daft?&rdquo; he growled out, clearly losing his patience with her. But this piece of information seemed to have caught Kendrel slightly off guard. &ldquo;I was hired to take out the other one, someone else wants the pleasure of killing him. Someone powerful.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;So, you want to kill Eric, and you were hired to take out Ryan?&rdquo; Kendrel was talking more to herself than to the Shadow. &ldquo;This is starting to make a little more sense.&rdquo; When Kendrel looked back towards the Shadow, her eyes caught the glint of something metal and she barely had time to move when Horatio fired his pistol at the Shadow.<br /><br />Within that split second of the trigger being pulled, the Shadow had narrowed his eyes and melded into the shadows on the floor, disappearing and avoiding the bullet altogether. Kendrel froze against the wall, the bullet lodging itself into the wall only a mere inch away from her nose. She no longer sensed the Shadow in the room and turned her glare to Horatio.<br /><br />&ldquo;Are you fucking nuts? Do you know how close that came to hitting me?&rdquo; She moved away from the wall and threw her arms in the air. Horatio merely clicked the safety back into position and replaced the pistol in the holster on his belt, and shrugged.<br /><br />&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t hit you though.&rdquo; He smirked and turned back to walk into the bedroom. Kendrel growled and followed him.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can still feel pain if I&rsquo;m shot. I may be immortal, but I can still feel pain, and die.&rdquo; She growled out as Horatio sat back in his chair, which had been moved to sit next to Calleigh. &ldquo;Did you at least send the boys the incantation?&rdquo; She was brought back to their current problem at hand.<br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br />Ryan took out the pieces of paper from his front pocket and handed them to Eric. &ldquo;Leave it to Calleigh to find a relatively simple solution to our communication problem.&rdquo; Ryan and Eric had been walking through a grassy field for the past several hours, looking for any sign of life. &ldquo;I bet she was thinking of building some kind of weapon, or device that would attempt the find us.&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric snorted, a small smirk playing on his lips. As her started to read the new notes his smirk turned into a grin. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, catching Ryan off guard. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found a way to get us out of here.&rdquo; He held the pieces of paper up in triumph.<br /><br />&ldquo;Really??&rdquo; Ryan grinned and moved closer to Eric to try and read the words that had been written. &ldquo;What do we have to do? Can we do it relatively quick?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like it should take that long. Seems all we have to do it say this stuff here, and it should get us out of here.&rdquo; Eric glanced at Ryan, the grin still spread across his face. Ryan looked up at him, with a matching grin.<br /><br />&ldquo;So what do you say, when we get out of here, after we get your eye checked out, I take you out?&rdquo; Eric&rsquo;s smirked had returned as he knew that he had caught Ryan relatively off guard.<br /><br />&ldquo;You mean, like a date?&rdquo; Ryan blinked slightly, then smiled and nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on. Now, let&rsquo;s get the hell out of here, Delko.&rdquo;<br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br />Kendrel looked at the mess that was Eric&rsquo;s apartment. Having been through four attacks from the same demon that spanned almost the entire apartment layout, it did not look pretty. She was pretty sure that if she didn&rsquo;t do something with it, Eric was going to be royally pissed when he came back.<br /><br />Which they were all hoping would be any time now. Kendrel waved her hand and a broom and dustpan moved to sweep up the large pieces of debris as she walked back into the bedroom, waiting in anticipation with Horatio and Calleigh.<br /><br />&ldquo;So, how long are waiting until we call this a failure? Because, it&rsquo;s already been three hours.&rdquo; Sometimes she got the feeling that she was the only keeping track of things like this.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait for another note from the boys before we try something new,&rdquo; Calleigh answered. &ldquo;Again, we&rsquo;re not sure how time moves, wherever they are.&rdquo; Kendrel rolled her eyes and opened her mouth to respond when she caught sight of Eric&rsquo;s arm moving.<br /><br />His body rolled slightly, as if he were waking up, and they all heard Ryan groan slightly. Kendrel blinked, surprised that the incantation had actually worked as Calleigh and Horatio ran over to Ryan and Eric. Eric was the first to open his eyes, meeting the expectant eyes of a grateful Calleigh. He started to mutter his thanks in Spanish and Calleigh chuckled.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re pretty happy that you came back, too.&rdquo; She took his hand and slowly helped him sit up. They both looked over at Ryan as his uninjured eye fluttered open, and Horatio helped his sit up, also.<br /><br />&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; Kendrel was standing at the end of the bed, with her hands on her hips. &ldquo;Because, I would like to state right now that I am not a maid service, and I expect some kind of compensation for taking care of your bum asses.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I think that we can counter that statement.&rdquo; Ryan leaned his head back against the headboard of the bed after he found a comfortable position. &ldquo;Should I be calling you Aunt, or something else?&rdquo; Eric snorted and his hand had moved its way over to intertwine with Ryan&rsquo;s.<br /><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;You were like two years old the last time you saw me,&rdquo; Kendrel muttered, arms now crossed over her chest. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you would remember me.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I didn&rsquo;t remember you.&rdquo; Ryan closed his eyes and gave Eric&rsquo;s hand a slight squeeze.<br /><br />&ldquo;We saw your picture up on the wall at Ryan&rsquo;s old house,&rdquo; Eric explained, sensing the exhaustion that was radiating from the younger man next to him. &ldquo;And I think that I speak for both of us when I say that we would like some kind of explanation, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that there a few other important things that take priority.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You are correct,&rdquo; Horatio nodded and grabbed his sunglasses from his lapel pocket. He slipped them on and glanced at the boys. &ldquo;A trip to the hospital is in order for at least one of you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan groaned but didn&rsquo;t move of open his eye. Horatio and Calleigh both grabbed one of Ryan&rsquo;s arms, slipping them over their shoulders and helping him off of the bed. Kendrel walked over and grabbed one of Eric&rsquo;s arms, hanging back a little as the other three made their way out of the bedroom.<br /><br />&ldquo;So, I take it that a few other things happened?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow at him, and elaborated when Eric didn&rsquo;t seem to get her hint. &ldquo;You two a couple now, or something?&rdquo; Eric&rsquo;s mouthed shaped into a little &lsquo;o.&rsquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Or something,&rdquo; he smirked a little as they started to move.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank the gods,&rdquo; Kendrel smirked then turned serious. &ldquo;How was he? I know Praxon, and he doesn&rsquo;t play nice with others.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;He indeed does not,&rdquo; Eric agreed. &ldquo;I think that it&rsquo;s going to take Ryan a little bit to cope, but as long as he has some time to deal with it without something else popping up to ruin his life, he should be okay.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;This is Ryan that we&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Kendrel pointed out.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, I know.&rdquo; Eric nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s also why I&rsquo;ve concluded that I&rsquo;m going to be around him for a while.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Because you want to protect him, or for another reason?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, I can watch after him when I take him out for our date.&rdquo; Eric smiled slightly as they left his apartment, the door shutting behind him. &ldquo;Also, I think that I&rsquo;ll be staying at his apartment with him for a while.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; Kendrel raised an eyebrow as they caught up with the others at the elevator.<br /><br />&ldquo;Because you trashed my apartment.&rdquo; He looked at Kendrel, and she skillfully turned her attention elsewhere. Ryan smirked slightly and shook his head, happy to be home.<br /><br />As the elevator doors shut, two pairs of golden eyes glinted from the shadows of the hallway. Two figures moved out from the shadows of the hall over to the recently emptied apartment. The pair moved to Eric&rsquo;s apartment and the door slid open with no effort, on it&rsquo;s own. Both men walked into the apartment, and as the door slid shut the golden-eyed copy of Eric turned to smirk at his &lsquo;copy-cat&rsquo; partner, Ryan.</lj-cut><br />"

"event","So, I'm moving into over drive with my NaNo Novel; read as, I'm kicking my ass to edit it and make it appealing to agents. So every night I go through a couple pages at a time and edit it, and oh man, let me tell you. The Track Changes in Word, my document has never looked so colorful before, lol. Okay, so the point of this post. I'm looking for a couple people who rather soon in the future would like to read through my novel, not as an editor, but as a Fantasy Genre Reader. You know, to read through it and tell me if it's something that you would go and buy.<br /><br />Now should I get this surprising number amount of people, I will have to say no to some people. I don't want everyone and their brother reading it, just because what ambition would you guys have to go out and buy it?! :P Below is a summary (albeit a sucky one) of the novel. If you're interested leave a comment, or if you came here from Facebook, or MySpace, then go ahead and send me a message from there.<br /><br />Eventually I will need an editing eye to read it through too, cause I have grammar, and as I'm noticing, tense, issues. So if you'd like to volunteer for that, it would be Mondo appreciated. I'd have to do something special for you, too.<br /><br /> <br /><lj-cut text=""summary"">Her name was the only thing she remembered after the storm; Ayala Audra Montegrove. Ayala doesn't even remember being caught in the storm that destroyed her home and memories. Now, almost 15 years later, answers start showing up, answers to questions she hadn't asked.<br /> Being part of the slowly growing, and discriminated against magikal community doesn't help in her search for the truth. Her world is about to be turned upside down, to the left right, and done all over again. And Ayala thoguht her destiny was to be a newspaper columnist and freelance writer. Oh, how very wrong she was. Her life is about to include the rest of the world.<br /><br /><br />So just leave your name, email address, and stuff, and I'll let you know when I'll be sending a copy. Oh I will be sending it as a .doc file. It would be wonderful if you had Word, if not OpenOffice is free, and opens Word files. It's amazing.<br /><br />Thanks! ;D<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut> <br />"

I do own the pasts that I made up about them though. Um, that's about it, not making any money :(<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<lj-cut text=""Ryan wasn't exactly sure how he gotten where he was."">R-15<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in""><br />&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">Ryan wasn't exactly sure how he had gotten where he was. Living at the school he had found out just how different these boys in his dormitory were from the kids and teenagers at the public schools in Miami. His roommate told him that there was a party on the other side of campus. He didn't think that they would be sneaking into the girls dormitory.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">Now here he was sitting in a chair in a corner while his roommate sat on the couch, his mouth seemingly glued to some girl's lips. Half of the guys at the party looked the same, or they were trying to get some of the girls into their bedrooms. To say that Ryan felt uncomfortable was an enormous understatement.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">Jack, his roommate, finally pulled himself away from the brunette and looked over at Ryan. &ldquo;Come on man, enjoy the party. There are plenty of girls here.&rdquo; The brunette leaned her head on Jack's shoulder, and glanced at Ryan.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;He seems shy, like my roommate,&rdquo; she smiled and let out a giggle. &ldquo;He looks young. How old are you Ryan?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;I turned fifteen not to long ago,&rdquo; Ryan said quietly. He knew that he was one of the youngest boys in his grade. Most of the boys already had their driver's license and in a few short months would be driving home in the cars that their parents had bought for them. But as one of the youngest sophomores he would be getting on a train to go to the new house that his Aunt and Uncle had bought in Boston. He would at least be able to spend time with his brother.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;He's kind of adorable Jack, you should bring him more often.&rdquo; The girl giggled again and Ryan felt his cheeks warm. Jack whispered something in her ear and she nodded, then both got up from the couch leaving Ryan alone in the corner.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">As Ryan contemplated leaving, and wondering if he would be able to make it back without being caught, he failed to notice the blonde that sat down on the couch.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Ryan blinked and looked up at the new feminine voice. &ldquo;I'm Janine, you must be Jack's roommate.&rdquo; She smiled at him showing perfectly white teeth.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Uh yeah,&rdquo; Ryan nodded. He noticed that she was about as tall as he was and she must have been close to seventeen years old. Ryan straightened a little as Janine moved to sit on the arm of the chair.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Don't worry about being so shy.&rdquo; She reassured him before swooping her head down to initiate a a soft kiss. Ryan blinked, caught off guard, but didn't move to return the kiss. This didn't seem to turn Janine off, and she leaned in again after a second, capturing Ryan's lips in a deeper kiss. When Ryan didn't permit Janine entrance to his mouth she leaned back to look at him.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Everything okay, babe?&rdquo; She frowned, leaning back to regard the young man.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Um, no, I don't think so.&rdquo; He ignored her probing look, and got up from the chair, heading for the door. He passed Jack and his brunette, but didn't take notice until Jack had grabbed his arm.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Hey man, what's up?&rdquo; The brunette in his arm seemed annoyed that they had been distracted again.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Nothing, I just gotta go.&rdquo; Ryan shook his head and left the room, headed to stairs. He needed to see Josh back at his building. He had questions.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">When he first moved into the dorms he had met Josh. He had seemed nice, and was lucky enough to be living by himself. After he told Jack about meeting Josh he was instantly warned against talking to him. He noticed that no on in their classes talked to Josh, and when Ryan asked he was told it was because Josh was a homo.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">Now Josh was just the person he needed to talk to. He hoped that Josh was still awake as he knocked on the boys door. After several moments that door opened slowly to show Josh in his pajama's, but he could see the glow of his computer screen in his room, proving that he wasn't asleep.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;Ryan?&rdquo; Josh was slightly surprised to see the young man at his door. &ldquo;Are you sure you wanna be here?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">&ldquo;I have questions,&rdquo; Ryan said quietly, and looked up to meet the Junior's eyes. &ldquo;I think I might like guys.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.5in"">A look of understanding dawned in Josh's eyes and he opened the door for Ryan to walk in. Ryan eventually feel asleep in Josh's room, but he eventually was able to ask most of his questions.</p></lj-cut>"

Um, that's about it, not making any money :(<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""His bags were packed."">Ryan- 14<br />Eric- 16<br /><br />His bags were packed. They were sitting in the backseat of Uncle Ron&rsquo;s car along with the bags of his brother, the back of his Uncle&rsquo;s SUV was full of the boxes and things that hadn&rsquo;t been shipped off to the new house. Of course all those things would have to be sorted through, and the new house would have to be sold. This was something that Ryan&rsquo;s Uncle had told him not to worry about though, he was too young to deal with any of it.<br /><br />But Ryan found that he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. With his parents around he always knew what to expect, they had a routine for him. He found that tears came to his eyes as he tried to make a plan, tried to figure out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />His parents had to have a plan after a doctor had diagnosed Ryan with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. After school he would come home, he would take his medications, do his homework, then he would usually go over to Eric&rsquo;s until dinner. Sometimes they would study together and he would help Eric with science while Eric would usually help him with math. But it was something that they usually decided on at least a day before. Eric has been surprisingly calm about the whole thing, and had been patient when listening to Ryan and helping him come up with plans.<br /><br />Now the only thing that he knew was that He was going to Boston, nothing else. His mind was a whirl and wouldn&rsquo;t stop moving with thought. Ryan quickly brushed at his tears with the sleeve of his jacket. No one else had understood his OCD as well as his parents and Eric, and now he wasn&rsquo;t even going to have Eric around to help him.<br /><br />He brought up his knees and dropped his head down onto his knees as his arms wrapped around his legs. Ryan had found his way up to the roof the night before he had to leave Miami. He didn&rsquo;t jump when a pair of arms wound their way around his shoulders and a head dropped on top of his.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; came they softly accented voice of Eric. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be sleeping?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I could ask the same thing of you.&rdquo; Ryan retaliated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got school in the morning. And as hard as it is to believe, the world does not revolve around Eric Delko.&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric snorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;ve been listening to, but it most certainly does.&rdquo; For the first time in a week Ryan felt the corners of his mouth turn up in a smile. &ldquo;And if what you say is true and it doesn&rsquo;t, then I think that it should change it&rsquo;s mind and start.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You have a very large ego, you know that right?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only reminded every so often by this certain guy. I guess he&rsquo;s pretty smart.&rdquo; He felt Eric shrug. &ldquo;Got this weird thing though, where he likes to be organized, and clean, and make a plan. And I think that plans are overrated sometimes.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan sighed a little and relaxed in Eric&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;But, I like my plans.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t plan out your life, Ryan, it doesn&rsquo;t want to be planned out.&rdquo; Eric looked up at the stars that were visible in the night sky. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t plan this moment, and what do you think of it right now?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;A little bit like heaven.&rdquo;</lj-cut><br />"

Cause my beta is that awesome to get this to me on Christmas Eve, :D. Thanks to <lj user=""sunhawk"">&nbsp;!<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Chapter 5!"">Chapter 5<br /><br />Ryan was taking deep breaths and looking up at the sky as he lay on his back by the water. Eric had ripped off part of his fraying jeans and was attempting to get the blood out of it. Ryan felt his hands clenching into fists, taking grass and dirt up from the ground as he did so. Although Eric had done his best to clean around the piece of wood, Ryan could still feel it every time he blinked, and he wanted nothing more than to reach up and pull it out.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hopefully we&rsquo;ll run into a house, or some kind of city soon, if this place is as messed up as it seems to be,&rdquo; Eric muttered, wringing out the jean piece one more time. He pulled himself back over by Ryan and took one of his clenching hands, rubbing the back of it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be able to treat it with something and pull out the wood.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you pull it out now? There&rsquo;s less of a chance of me bleeding out now,&rdquo; Ryan asked in a quiet, but pain-laced voice.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that it I pull it out too fast or if my fingers slip, you&rsquo;ll be left with splinters, and then it&rsquo;ll grow infected.&rdquo; Eric admitted. &ldquo;I wanna be able to treat it with some kind of cream when I pull it out, also.&rdquo; Ryan nodded slightly and took a deep breath.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think I can walk now, if you want to keep moving.&rdquo; Ryan told him, still hanging on to Eric&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;We should keep following the water, it should eventually lead us to people.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;How do you figure?&rdquo; Eric asked while he helped Ryan sit up slowly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, someone will have seen this and they&rsquo;ll have wanted to turn this into a water supply for others. So it should lead us to some kind of water place, or something, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Ryan shrugged a little. &ldquo;I might just be delirious. I know that&rsquo;s not really how a lot of things work, but in this messed up world, maybe it is.&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric stood up and grabbed both of Ryan&rsquo;s hand to pull him up. &ldquo;Well, it's worth a shot and I don&rsquo;t really have anything else to go on, so we might as well try it. Are you sure you want to up and walking? Don&rsquo;t want to rest any longer?&rdquo; Eric asked, concern in his voice.<br /><br />&ldquo;I wanna get this thing the hell out of my eye,&rdquo; Ryan answered ruefully. Eric smiled slightly and nodded and they started to walk, still holding hands.<br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br />Kendrel watched while Horatio talked to Calleigh on his cell phone. He had no idea what was wrong with Eric and Ryan, but he knew that he had a few books on their condition. Kendrel rolled her eyes a little; Horatio had books on just about everything.<br /><br />When Horatio flipped his phone closed, she looked at him expectantly. &ldquo;Calleigh&rsquo;s going to look, then bring over whatever she finds,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;So this shadow figure that keeps attacking,&rdquo; he turned to look at her. &ldquo;Do you think that it&rsquo;ll come back?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Usually does, if he didn&rsquo;t die from the five story drop.&rdquo; She shrugged and looked around. &ldquo;So do you think that if Ryan doesn&rsquo;t wake up soon that some real damage could be done to his eye?&rdquo;<br /><br />Horatio was silent for a moment but then nodded. &ldquo;I think that whatever is happening to them wherever they are, is happening to them here. It seems to me that is some kind of spell, and that someone wanted Ryan out of the way. Eric might have just gotten in the way.&rdquo;<br /><br />Kendrel blew some air out of her mouth. &ldquo;Of course, just my luck. As long as they wake up.&rdquo; Horatio nodded, agreeing with her. They were silent for a couple minutes when Kendrel looked up. &ldquo;I think that this is part of something bigger.&rdquo;<br /><br />Horatio looked at her and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Why do you say that? Demon intuition?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;Just intuition. I mean, why just put Ryan to sleep, or whatever he is, when they could have just killed him. It&rsquo;s obvious that he was caught off guard, because he didn&rsquo;t try to fight back, so they had the opportunity to kill him.&rdquo;<br /><br />Horatio seemed to think about her words for a minute then nodded. &ldquo;Someone else wants to kill him, or something similar.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Kendrel threw up her hands. &ldquo;Why is this family always cursed with bad luck?&rdquo;<br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br />It took some time, but Eric and Ryan stumbled across another house, finally reaching the end of the wooded area. Ryan heard Eric groan and turned his head to look at him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re at my house.&rdquo; Eric muttered out. Ryan chuckled slightly as they continued to walk.<br /><br />&ldquo;Not so happy to be home?&rdquo; He asked, and Eric rolled his eyes.<br /><br />&ldquo;As long as none of my family is here.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, so far we haven&rsquo;t run across any other person that we know.&rdquo; <br /><br />Eric nodded. &ldquo;I think we might be in luck this time.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;After we take care of this we can try and find a way out of here.&rdquo; They soon reached the front door and Eric found that it wasn&rsquo;t locked, very much unlike how it actually was when he was growing up there. He helped Ryan inside and they made their way to the bathroom. Ryan sat down on the toilet as he watched Eric rummage through the medicine cabinet.<br /><br />&ldquo;Do you even know what you&rsquo;re looking for?&rdquo; He had to sit on his hands to resist the urge to reach up and rub his eye. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure like some rubbing alcohol, maybe some cream, bandages, stuff like that should help. That&rsquo;s what Mama gave me whenever I got hurt,&rdquo; Eric rattled off like it was no problem. Ryan was seriously doubting Eric&rsquo;s abilities at that moment. He was no doctor, but neither was Ryan. At that moment he had resigned himself to going blind.<br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, this should work.&rdquo; Eric turned around, putting a few bottles and a tube on the back of the toilet. He had a pair of tweezers and a wet cloth in his hand and looked at Ryan. &ldquo;You can hold onto the edge of the toilet seat and I&rsquo;ll slowly pull out the wood. This way if there are any slivers that break lose, I can get them easily.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan let out a shaky breath and slowly gripped the sides of the toilet seat. &ldquo;Okay, I think I&rsquo;m ready. Just do this quick.&rdquo; Ryan closed his good eye tightly then relaxed so he wasn&rsquo;t making it any harder for Eric.<br /><br />Eric took his own breath and shook out his hand before slowly lowering the tweezers. He gently gripped the end of the wood chunk. &ldquo;So do you have any ideas how we get home?&rdquo; He thought that maybe he could keep Ryan distracted by talking to him. It might make things go a little more smoothly.<br /><br />&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Ryan liked giving one word answers when his eyesight was on the line, but figured that Eric was only trying to help. &ldquo;Hopefully Kendrel has called Horatio and they&rsquo;re working on something.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not even sure how much time has passed in the real world, or whatever,&rdquo; Eric responded as he started to gently pull up, very slowly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Just like we&rsquo;re not sure how much time has passed in this world?&rdquo; Ryan commented on their own time dilemma.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure who the optimist is supposed to be in this relationship, but neither one of us is doing a good job at it right now.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan felt his mind become highly distracted by Eric&rsquo;s use of the word relationship. In fact he became so distracted by his own inner thoughts that he jumped when Eric finally pulled the piece of wood out of his eye and placed the wet cloth in its place.<br /><br />&ldquo;So far so good. Are you feeling any other pain?&rdquo; Ryan looked up at Eric and shook his head. &ldquo;Good, it doesn&rsquo;t look to be bleeding anymore,&rdquo; he turned to grab some gauze and tape from the back of the toilet.<br /><br />&ldquo;Where do you think we should go after this?&rdquo; Ryan asked, not looking at Eric as he gently placed the gauze over his eye.<br /><br />&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to stay here?&rdquo; Eric ripped off some of the medical tape and placed it around the edges of the gauze.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think that if we stay in one place for too long, that&rsquo;s when trouble usually finds us. Also, if we keep moving we might find some way to get out of here, or to contact someone else.&rdquo; Ryan pointed out and put his hand over the gauze. It was dark, but he couldn&rsquo;t be sure if it was because of the gauze covering his eye, or because they had waited too long to take out the wood.<br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br />Horatio was looking through the books that Calleigh had brought over, and Kendrel was looking through the bag of weapons that she had also brought with her. Calleigh herself was watching the boys, looking for anything unusual, other than the fact that wouldn&rsquo;t wake up.<br /><br />Calleigh sat down in the chair closest to Ryan and watched him for any movement. But it wasn&rsquo;t any body movement that caught her attention, but the fact that a piece of gauze had slowly materialized over Ryan&rsquo;s damaged eye. His body seemed to relax and his head turned towards Eric, their hands almost touching.<br /><br />&ldquo;Guys,&rdquo; she sat up in the chair, and idea slowly forming in her mind. She kept watching the boys but did notice that neither of them had paid any attention to her when she talked. &ldquo;Hey, you guys, I have an idea.&rdquo;<br /><br />Kendrel tried not to sigh out loud and put down the sword that she had been training with. &ldquo;What kind of idea?&rdquo; Horatio glanced up from the book he was reading through to watch the girls interact.<br /><br />&ldquo;Look at Ryan, notice anything different?&rdquo; This time Horatio put down his book and walked closer to Ryan, as did Kendrel.<br /><br />&ldquo;Did you dress his eye?&rdquo; Horatio of course was the first one to notice the difference.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, it just appeared, on its own.&rdquo; Calleigh looked back up at the two as they stared at Ryan with confused expressions. &ldquo;But it gives me an idea. This means that someone, most likely Eric, has tried to treat Ryan&rsquo;s eye in whatever realm they&rsquo;re in. She if things can appear from their realm into ours,&hellip;&rdquo; Calleigh trailed off, noticing that both adults in the room were following her thinking.<br /><br />&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to say that stuff from where we are won&rsquo;t show up where they are,&rdquo; Kendrel was the first one to answer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like, on the verge of brilliant.&rdquo; Calleigh rolled her eyes and leaned over to the table that Horatio has his books at and grabbed a piece of paper and a pen.<br /><br />&ldquo;I say that we write them a note, try and get it to them so we know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; She started to write quickly on the paper.<br /><br />&ldquo;How exactly are they going to get it back to us? And how are you going to get it to them?&rdquo; Although she was the first one to catch on to Calleigh&rsquo;s idea, she was also the first to find any flaws.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try and put it in Ryan&rsquo;s pocket and hope that it works. As for getting a note back,&rdquo; Calleigh shrugged as she folded up the note. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re going to have to leave it up to them to figure out.&rdquo; She moved Ryan&rsquo;s arm so that she could get to the front pocket of Ryan&rsquo;s jeans and slipped the note in.<br /><br />&ldquo;We just have to have hope that it&rsquo;ll work,&rdquo; Horatio nodded and sat back down at the table. <br /><br />Kendrel turned to look at him then grumbled and picked the sword back up. &ldquo;If he calls me Padawan, then someone will die by this sword.&rdquo; She swung it in the air, cutting the head off of a flower.</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Title: Not So Glorious Cold Weather<br />Rating: PG<br />Pairing: Ryan/Eric<br />Summary: Sequel to Glorious White Powder. Eric and Ryan once again find themselves in cold weather, but not where they want to be.<br />A/N: I had fun writing the prompt from Alligator138 last year that I had to follow up to it, lol. Also, i was inspired by the freezing cold weather where I'm at right now, and how I'm about as wrapped up as Eric.<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Eric wondered he was talked into these things."">Eric wondered how he was talked into these things. Four years ago he found himself in Boston with Ryan&rsquo;s brother, and then, to Eric&rsquo;s pleasure, they stayed in Miami for the next three Christmas&rsquo;s, where there was no snow. He looked at his husband who was having his own difficulties trying to keep the teenaged Chris and pre-teen Alice wrapped up in their own clothes.<br /><br />Eric kept his gloved hand underneath the armpits of his three jackets, and tried not to breathe out through the two scarves very often. His eye twitched slightly when Pavel Delko came up from behind his son and slapped his back.<br /><br />&ldquo;Is it not wonderful to be back in the Old Country?&rdquo; Papa Delko only wore one jack, a pair of cotton gloves and a rather furry parka on his head. Eric had a fleeting thought of how lucky his mother was and how she was still in Miami, celebrating Christmas with his sisters and their families.<br /><br />&ldquo;Why are we in Russia, Papa?&rdquo; Eric had asked once a day, either to his father or to Ryan.<br /><br />&ldquo;Cheer up! Tomorrow is Christmas Eve and we have a lot to do and see while we are here.&rdquo; He smiled and walked over picking up Alice, and removing one of the scarves that Ryan had tied tightly to keep out the cold. She giggled and hugged her Papi around the neck.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is exciting Papi,&rdquo; she smiled and they both watched Ryan and Chris fighting with the scarves. Chris pushed Ryan&rsquo;s hands away and pulled up the hood of his jacket, thinking that it would solve the problem. He was wrong.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very often you get to visit such a great country, one that is full of Delko family history.&rdquo; Pavel nodded, agreeing with his granddaughter. Both Eric and Ryan had to refrain from snorting.<br /><br />Eric walked over and looped his arms with Ryan&rsquo;s before he could focus back on the brooding teenager. &ldquo;If he wants to freeze, let him freeze. He&rsquo;ll get sick and then you can say &lsquo;I told you, so.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, hey! Wait a minute!&rdquo; Chris narrowed his eyes at his Papa then walked over to Pavel and Alice, listening to Pavel point out buildings and explaining how a Delko had something to do with it being famous.<br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, I would give anything to be back in Boston, if we have to be in cold weather.&rdquo; Ryan turned and snuggled his face into one of Eric&rsquo;s scarves. Ryan wasn&rsquo;t as bundled as Eric, but he was wearing two jackets, two scarves and a hat underneath his hood.<br /><br />&ldquo;I would give anything to be back in Miami. Even going to Mexico to visit Mama&rsquo;s family would be preferred right about now.&rdquo; Eric rubbed Ryan&rsquo;s arms, hoping to warm both of them up. They both looked over at a Grandfather excitedly talking with his two favorite grandchildren and both knew why they were in Russia.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to keep each other extra warm while we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Ryan muttered again into Eric&rsquo;s scarf.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no problem with that,&rdquo; Eric grinned as his hand moved to rub Ryan&rsquo;s back. Ryan snorted and chuckled. Their moment was interrupted as Alice ran over and grabbed they covered hands and started to pull them.<br /><br />&ldquo;Come on! Papi is going to show up the big palace!&rdquo; She pulled them over to where Pavel and Chris were standing, waiting rather patiently.<br /><br />Chris and Alice instantly took the lead as Ryan and Eric walked next to Pavel. &ldquo;I think that this is one of the best Christmas&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve had in a long while.&rdquo; The older Delko smiled at his sons. Ryan took Eric&rsquo;s hand as he smiled and nodded his head. &ldquo;By the way, I may have told the little ones that the Delko line lived in that palace because they were Royalty.&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric and Ryan&rsquo;s eyes widened as Alice and Chris took Pavel&rsquo;s hands to pull him up front with them. &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; Eric groaned and Ryan chuckled.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be a long visit.&rdquo; Ryan kissed Eric&rsquo;s cheek and squeezed his hand. They would both be anticipating Alice acting like a Princess, and Chris trying to use his Princely bloodline to not do anymore chores.<br /><br />&ldquo;A long Christmas I think.&rdquo; They smiled as the Delko clan officially started their Christmas Vacation in Russia.</lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","Yesterday, was a great day.

I got my brand new iMac! The desktop version of the mac laptop, only it doesn't have a tower. The tower is a different thing, and costs bucco bucks, lol. It's a 20 inch screen, and it's beautiful. 4gb memory with a 500 gb hard drive. I also got Microsoft Office 2008, Fable: The Lost Chapters, and a Bamboo Wacom tablet. All at a very good price, cause I ordered it all through the Apple Education store. And when I get my books for my Winter classes I will also be getting Adobe Photoshop CS4, through the Education store, for like 300 bucks. Steal!

The greatest part about all of this. I didn't have to pay for a scent of it. This computer will be helping me out through my Art degree at Delta, and go on with me to most likely through my Master's degree. And I got a Pell Grant that I was able to use to buy these beautiful babies. My Beautiful Mac. I still have my Toshiba laptop, and I'll keep it, but now that I have Office for my mac I can take it off of my laptop, and a lot of other things. I can free up SOOOOO&nbsp;much space on that laptop and then I would like to use that one primarily for gaming and if I have use it somewhere else, like when I randomly travel. You can bet that whenever I'm home I'll be using this baby.

I love being able to make a playlist and play it from my bed with the little apple remote. I can watch movies from my bed too. AMAZING. LOVE&nbsp;IT. I think I officially have Apple envy, lol. I got my new iPod, 120gb, and now I&nbsp;have this lovely piece of machinery.

p.s. my baby Pudge is sleeping in my lap as I type this. She randomly likes to climb up into my lap and sleep,except now she woke up and is watching me type. She has human like qualities."

I've also taken a few liberties with their age.<br />Spoilers: None<br />Pairings: Ryan/Eric, pre-slash<br />Disclaimer: I am saddened that I don't own either Ryan or Eric. I do own the pasts that I made up about them though. Um, that's about it, not making any money :(<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""006 Break Away"">Ryan- 14<br />Eric- 16<br /><br />Somewhere in the middle of the night Ryan found Eric with his arms around his waist. H was almost surprised to find that Eric liked to cuddle at night. Unfortunately for Ryan, his mind wouldn&rsquo;t allow him to dwell on that thought for very long. He had tried to sleep that night, he knew that he needed it, but he couldn&rsquo;t, his restless mind wouldn&rsquo;t give him peace.<br /><br />The doorbell ran and Eric shifted, groaning at the sound, but didn&rsquo;t wake up. Ryan slowly slipped off of the bed when Eric&rsquo;s arms loosened and softly padded down the stairs. He heard voices filtering out from the living room.<br /><br />&ldquo;-new homeowners, the agreed to give the boys an extra week.&rdquo; Ryan recognized his Uncle Ron&rsquo;s voice. He suddenly felt bad for not telling him where he went last night.<br /><br />&ldquo;If you need any help, let us know,&rdquo; Pavel offered.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ryan is welcome here anytime,&rdquo; Clorinda added. &ldquo;Mi&rsquo;jo come here last night in tears. He&rsquo;s probably still sleeping with Eric right now.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you. I really appreciate it and I&rsquo;m sure Ryan does, too.&rdquo; Ryan heard Clorinda&rsquo;s soft chuckle.<br /><br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good boy, we&rsquo;re happy to have him around.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re still going to have to move?&rdquo; Ryan blinked when he heard Eric&rsquo;s father voice the question. He hadn&rsquo;t thought about that, then his hopes started to rise, praying his Uncle said no.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; his Uncle seemed to sigh. &ldquo;The house was already sold and they closed on the sale before the accident. Ryan&rsquo;s already been enrolled in a private school in Boston and Jack is expected at his Aunt and Uncle&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan sat down on the stairs and looked down at the carpet. He hadn&rsquo;t thought about what would happen, he hadn&rsquo;t really thought about anything since his Uncle came over. He didn&rsquo;t even remember running off until he found himself in Eric&rsquo;s room, with Eric&rsquo;s arms around him as he tried to comfort his hurt friend.<br /><br />&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t make an exception for the boys?&rdquo; He was brought back when he heard the soft voice of Eric&rsquo;s mother speaking again.<br /><br />&ldquo;I tried, and I would take the boys but I don&rsquo;t have the resources to suddenly take care of two boys.&rdquo; He heard the regret in his Uncle&rsquo;s voice. Ryan wouldn&rsquo;t dare ask the Delko&rsquo;s to take him in. And he couldn&rsquo;t leave his little brother alone, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to see him anyway, he would be living at school with all the other boys who went there. He sighed and slowly walked down the stairs to meet his Uncle.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hi, Uncle Ron.&rdquo; Ryan said quietly, surprising the three adults by his sudden appearance in the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for running off last night.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ron walked forward and took the young boy in arms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, I knew you couldn&rsquo;t have gone far.&rdquo; Ryan wrapped his arms around his Uncle&rsquo;s waist and sighed silently. Ron held Ryan out at arms length to look at him. &ldquo;You can stay here a little longer if you want, you look exhausted.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to impose or anything,&rdquo; Ryan said quietly. Even in his state he was still polite.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never imposing, mi&rsquo;jo,&rdquo; Clorinda spoke up. &ldquo;Your Uncle is right, you should go back upstairs and sleep.&rdquo; Ryan nodded and hugged each of the adults before shuffling back upstairs.</lj-cut><br />"

With his past catching up with him and Eric along for the ride, getting home seems harder by the minute. But what other mysteries must Ryan uncover while in this alternate reality? What exactly is Kendrel's secret and how does it affect Ryan?<br /><br />A/N: Woo hoo! The next chapter in less than a month! Don't expect it often though, lol. The past couple weeks just seemed to fly by, so it's all good. Here's Chapter 4!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Chapter 4"">Chapter 4<br /><br />Kendrel sighed as she flipped through a magazine in her fixed spot in the bedroom. It had been two days since they had found Ryan unconscious, and now she was starting to get bored. If they stayed like this much longer, she was going to have to make the decision of having to do a favor for Eric and call in to his job for him, tell them he was visiting a dying family member and wasn&rsquo;t going to make it into the work for a couple days. <br /><br />She paused in reading an article and shuddered. &lsquo;Doing a favor for Delko. Well, he would owe me for that.&rsquo; She smirked at the thought of what she could possibly make Eric do to pay her back. After a few minutes she was brought back to the problem at hand. If Eric and Ryan stayed unconscious for a while, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep up the excuses to anyone who wanted to see them. Eric could have only so many dying relatives before people stopped believing it.<br /><br />She had no idea where to look, and she couldn&rsquo;t leave the boys alone. Not when a threat had already made itself known. Kendrel rolled her eyes and almost smacked her forehead.<br /><br />&ldquo;Duh, Horatio.&rdquo; She snorted at herself then got up in search of one of Eric&rsquo;s phones. As she walked down the hallway from the bedroom, she was suddenly tackled and slammed down to the floor. She snarled and pushed herself up from the ground and came face to face with the shadow from before. &rdquo;You just don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; She growled and launched herself at the shadow.<br /><br />The shadow melted into the wall before she could reach him, then appeared from the other side, pushing Kendrel into the drywall. He slid across the floor and ran into the bedroom. Before he could get too far Kendrel flipped over his head and stopped in front of him. She grabbed the shadow&rsquo;s wrist and threw him back out into the hallway, his head hitting the door frame and he dropped to the ground. He made a hissing noise in his throat and twisted before Kendrel could grab him again. He seemed to bend away from her hands and kicked her back, sending her sprawling to the ground and out into the hallway. He kicked the door shut and watched as it locked.<br /><br />Kendrel let out a frustrated yell and slammed on the door. Every time she got up, this freak tried to make an attack on the boys. The shadow quickly walked over to the boys then locked eyes on Ryan. He picked Ryan up by the front of his shirt and threw him across the floor. He looked back at Eric but was distracted when the bedroom door was splintered by blue fire. Kendrel&rsquo;s eyes were glowing once again and she was growling in anger.<br /><br />&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;ve pissed me off,&rdquo; she said through gritted teeth. She was suddenly in front of him, her fingers wrapped around the shadow&rsquo;s neck. She picked him up and threw him out the bedroom window, watching him plummet five floors to the ground. She wasn&rsquo;t able to see if he hit the ground though; she was distracted by the sudden pain-filled screams of Ryan on the floor. Quickly turning around, she ran over to his tossing body and grabbed onto his arms.<br /><br />His hands were grabbing up by his face and she tried to pull them away. Her eyes widened when she finally managed to pin his hands to the ground. &ldquo;Oh, shit. This is not good.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br /><br />Ryan tried to scramble away but Eric grabbed his hands as they both stood up and started to back away.<br /><br />&ldquo;Did you two really think that you would get away from me?&rdquo; Praxon stood several feet away from the boys. &ldquo;That I would just let you wander away, thinking that you were safe? I made this world that you&rsquo;re in, and I will always know where you try to hide.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan was tugging on Eric&rsquo;s hands, desperately trying to pull him away, trying to get him to run. &ldquo;Why the hell are you following us?&rdquo; Eric challenged. Ryan resisted the urge to roll his eyes at Eric&rsquo;s stupid courage.<br /><br />&ldquo;Would you shut the hell up and run?&rdquo; Ryan hissed through his teeth.<br /><br />&ldquo;I admire his stupidity. But I think I can spare a moment of two to tell you why you will both die.&rdquo; Praxon seemed to don a thoughtful expression. &ldquo;You, Ryan Wolfe, were to be my thirteenth victim, you were the last target.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The last? Last target for what?&rdquo; Ryan seemed to frown.<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, if I kill thirteen of the targets, than I am to become invincible, I receive immortality Nothing would be able to hurt me, to kill me. Now I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, or probably not thinking, surely it couldn&rsquo;t take that long to kill thirteen targets.&rdquo; The powerful demon seemed to shrug. &ldquo;But then again, I don&rsquo;t make up the rules.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What rules?&rdquo; Ryan thought that the next time Eric talked he might just have to hit him. They could be taking this time to run away while Praxon talked. <br /><br />&ldquo;The rules that all demons were give. Kill thirteen targets and you receive immortality. Any demon who killed thirteen could receive it, no competition of being the first. Most of the targets hadn&rsquo;t been born. I was given my list in France in 1357. Your parents were not Targets, they just got in my way of killing you. I&rsquo;m thousands of years old, and I&rsquo;ve killed tens of thousands of people in my life time.&rdquo; <br /><br />Ryan wanted to hit himself, but he couldn&rsquo;t help but ask his own question, at least while Praxon was in a somewhat good mood. &ldquo;Why me? Why wait to kill me then?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sporting fun in the list. To find the target, not knowing what year or where they were going to be born. Each demon at one point was given a list of thirteen targets, and it took hundreds of years to take out that list. The lists were created by a Seer, and those on the list were seen to be the ones that would be a threat to us Demons. And you, Ryan Michael Wolfe, are the last on my list.&rdquo; He growled the last part, his mood for talking obviously diminished. &ldquo;I will receive my Immortality and be freed from this world<br /><br />Ryan&rsquo;s eyes widened and he pulled on Eric&rsquo;s arm, not wanting to stick around to ask anymore questions, and this time Eric turned and ran with Ryan through the trees. They created a zig-zag pattern, hoping to lose the demon chasing them.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is going to be a definite problem in the future,&rdquo; Eric said as he darted around a tree. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to think that too many people, or demons, or things want you dead.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re right up there on that list, too,&rdquo; Ryan huffed out. &ldquo;You keep hanging out with me, so they think you need to die, too.&rdquo;<br />Eric grabbed Ryan&rsquo;s hand and made a sharp left turn, skidding on some leaves and almost losing his balance. Ryan followed easily and pulled on Eric&rsquo;s arm, righting him up on his feet again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really good at this running thing.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I used to go on morning runs for several years in the morning.&nbsp; You just don&rsquo;t do enough running,&rdquo; Ryan commented.<br /><br />&ldquo;I will if I stick around you. Running for my life.&rdquo; Ryan snorted and rolled his eyes. Several minutes later Eric stopped and bent over trying to catch his breath.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t run without a break,&rdquo; Eric huffed out between breaths. Ryan nodded a little and looked around for any sign of Praxon.<br /><br />&ldquo;I think we may have lost him anyway. I&rsquo;ve never known him to run anyway, he didn&rsquo;t follow me when I was thirteen.&rdquo; Ryan looked at Eric and smiled slightly. Ryan suddenly felt a shiver down his back and his senses went on alert. Then just as quickly he started to relax. &ldquo;Eric,&rdquo; Ryan said quietly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Eric took one more breath and stood up. &ldquo;Ryan? You okay?&rdquo; Before Ryan could say anything a hand wrapped around Eric&rsquo;s shoulder and threw him backwards into a tree, knocking the wind out of the Cuban-Russian.<br /><br />Ryan&rsquo;s eyes widened but didn&rsquo;t move, his body was too relaxed and didn&rsquo;t want to move. Praxon walked up to Ryan slowly, a smirk on his face exposing sharpened canines. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to stand there while I kill you, and would you like to know why?&rdquo; He grinned wider as he stopped right in front of Ryan. &ldquo;Well, I think you might already know why. Those vampire hormones running through your veins are just my good luck.&rdquo;<br />Praxon drew his hand back behind him and a small glowing ball appeared in his palm. Eric coughed as he was able to catch his breath and he looked up to see the ball growing in size. His eyes widened and he looked at Ryan.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ryan!&rdquo; As Eric yelled Praxon thrust his arm forward, launching the projectile at Ryan. But before anything could happen Ryan was suddenly thrown to the ground by an unseen force. The glowing orb of power hit the tree behind Ryan turning it into slivers and chunks of wood. Praxon yelled in frustration and disappeared.<br /><br />Eric seemed to sigh in relief as he pushed himself up. &ldquo;That was too close Ryan.&rdquo; He looked over and saw Ryan&rsquo;s chest moving up and down rapidly and could hear Ryan&rsquo;s breath had quickened. &ldquo;Ryan?&rdquo; He hurried over and knelt down next to him. He looked at Ryan&rsquo;s right eye and he felt his own breath catch in his throat. A long sliver of the tree's bark had embedded itself between Ryan&rsquo;s eye and eyelid.<br /><br />Eric let out a long stream of Russian as he ran his hands through his hair. He grabbed Ryan&rsquo;s hand quickly and that&rsquo;s when he started to scream in pain. Eric quickly grabbed his other hand before it could find its way up to his eyes. &ldquo;Ryan! Stop, you can&rsquo;t pull it out!&rdquo;<br />Ryan started to shake his head frantically. &ldquo;Get it out, you need to get it out!&rdquo;<br /><br />Eric held onto Ryan&rsquo;s hands and squeezed them tightly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t pull it out. Listen to me, if you try to pull it out you might bleed out, or you might go blind. Trust me, can you do that? Can you trust me?&rdquo; Ryan&rsquo;s screams had stopped as he listened to Eric&rsquo;s voice. He nodded slightly in understanding. &ldquo;Okay, good. Now come on,&rdquo; he wrapped one of Ryan&rsquo;s arms around his neck and slowly helped Ryan stand up. &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a river or something nearby. If we can get it cleaned up a little we may be able to somehow take care of it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Ryan nodded weakly as he leaned on Eric. &ldquo;We really need to get out of here.&rdquo; Ryan muttered as they walked.<br /><br />Eric sighed and nodded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll find some way out of here.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />//\\// &lt;(- -&lt;) &lt;(- -)&gt; (&gt;- -)&gt; //\\//<br /><br /><br />Kendrel dabbed a wet wash cloth at Ryan&rsquo;s eye gently. It had taken her some time but she had eventually gotten Ryan back to his position on the bed next to Eric. Then she immediately called Horatio. She knew that the shadow hadn&rsquo;t done anything to Ryan&rsquo;s eye and she needed answers. She had almost all the blood washed off when Horatio walked into the bedroom.<br /><br />&ldquo;Kendrel?&rsquo; he raised an eyebrow and came to stand next to her at the bed by the boys.<br /><br />&ldquo;I have no idea what&rsquo;s going on Horatio,&rdquo; Kendrel sighed as she dropped the rag on the bedside table. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t wake up, and suddenly something just happens to Ryan&rsquo;s eyes. It was bleeding, was still is, but I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo; Indeed more blood had started to seep from the mysterious injury.<br /><br />&ldquo;Was anyone else here?&rdquo; He took of his glasses as he observed the coma-like state that the boys were in.<br /><br />&ldquo;There was someone, but he didn&rsquo;t get anywhere close to Ryan&rsquo;s eye. He threw him off the bed and then I threw him out the window.&rdquo; Kendrel couldn&rsquo;t help the small smirk of satisfaction that started to creep onto her face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when Ryan just started screaming in pain. I figured you might be able to help me figure out why they won&rsquo;t wake up. I don&rsquo;t wanna have to do any favors for anyone if they stay like this too long.&rdquo;<br /><br />Horatio didn&rsquo;t say anything for a couple minutes as he just looked at the two men on the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need you to tell me everything you know so far, I might have something. I&rsquo;ll have to call Calleigh, too. Did you use your powers at all?&rdquo;<br /><br />Kendrel looked at him and raised an eyebrow, then smirked slightly. &ldquo;Just this last time I did. This is the third time that someone has tried to attack them. You knew didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;<br /><br />Horatio just let a ghost of a smiled cross his lips. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was supposed to be a secret.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You tricky dog, you,&rdquo; she chuckled then started to tell him about the day they found Ryan.</lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","Ever get that feeling when you just want to cry, you don't know why, or what for, but you just feel like you have to cry? Sometimes it's hard to actually stop yourself and you can feel the tears coming? Yeah, I've had that a couple times.... this week. It's been getting worse lately, and sometimes I know why I would want to, and sometimes I don't know why. It's starting to get annoying, but this time I'm sitting the Writing Center at Delta, and it gets pretty crowded in here a lot. I was then trying to think of a place that I could go just to cry, and I can't do it at home, because my mom is there, and there's really no where around her to do it without someone always there. And then I was trying to think about just why I wanted to cry and it made me wish that I could just get over whatever it is, but it's hard, and I wish that I didn't have to feel this way.

I blew up at my mom when she was (annoying me) talkin to me, and then claimed that she knew exactly what I would do. She was like I know you, so don't try and say I don't. I just blew up and was like, you don't know as well as you think you do, so don't even try it. You don't know what I'm thinking or feeling. You don't know that I want to cry everyday and, just don't. I couldn't even talk to her I got so upset, and I stormed into the kitchen to try and get away from her. I was glad that she didn't say anything, but then again, I was kind of upset. Because she just kind of wrote off my little blow up as nothing. She doesn't take me seriously anymore, and when she thinks I'm lying she gives this stare, and I used to smile when I was lying, but now this look has just become so ridiculous that I smile whenever I see it. So she always thinks I'm lying, and I' just getting sick of it. I want to get out of there, I'm just so fucking stressed, and I have so many more problems inside that no one knows about, and probably never will know about.

Bah. Anyway, still working on NaNoWriMo. Coming to road blocks, and it's upsetting me. Oh well. I'll win this year, because I have to, I owe it to myself."

With his past catching up with him and Eric along for the ride, getting home seems harder by the minute. But what other mysteries must Ryan uncover while in this alternate reality? What exactly is Kendrel's secret and how does it affect Ryan?<br /><br />A/N: Yay for life getting in the way, lol. Both my beta and I had kind of forgotten about this chapter. And I'm in the middle of National Novel Writing Month, so the whole story had completely slipped my mind. But here is chapter 3! Woot!<br /><br /><br /> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Chapter 3""><p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;""><b>Chapter 3</b></font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">It felt like they had been walking through the forest for days, but then again, Ryan noted, the sun never set. They had stopped to rest several times and his leg was starting to feel better, just a little sore. He sighed as they stopped once again to rest.</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">I&rsquo;ve just noticed something,&rdquo; Eric commented as he took off his jacket. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had to stop for food, and I don&rsquo;t feel hungry.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Ryan nodded. &ldquo;I was thinking that too, it has to go along with the reason why the sun doesn&rsquo;t set.&rdquo; He shrugged as he slowly sat down, taking the weight off of his healing, but still sore, ankle. A slight silence followed and Ryan knew that Eric was itching to talk. He wanted to clear the air, but Ryan also knew that Eric would have many questions that he really didn&rsquo;t want to answer. &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Ryan sighed.</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Eric blinked and looked over at the younger man. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Go ahead and ask the questions that are plaguing you. I know you want to.&rdquo; Eric blinked then took a minute to think about what he should ask first. He didn&rsquo;t want to get Ryan upset right away.</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Well, who attacked us?&rdquo; Eric looked at Ryan but noticed that he didn&rsquo;t return his gaze, his eyes were locked on the dirt in front of him.</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Praxon,&rdquo; Ryan said quietly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a demon, obviously, I mean, I guess I found a few other things too, but-&ldquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Ryan,&rdquo; Eric said gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rambling again.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Right, sorry, I do that when I&rsquo;m nervous.&rdquo; Ryan took a breath. &ldquo;I know you read the report and all that, but it obviously doesn&rsquo;t give the whole story. I was thirteen, and I went downstairs to get something to eat, or something. I knew that my parents would be awake, they were always up before I was. My mom had a routine, so as to not upset my OCD, it was pretty bad at that time.&rdquo; Ryan looked up, leaning his head back. &ldquo;I think, think that I saw my mom die. I saw her look at me, then her eyes kinda lost their light.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Eric watched Ryan, knowing that he didn&rsquo;t have to be telling him any of this, but also knew that it was something that he probably needed to do. His hand moved and slowly rested on top of Ryan&rsquo;s, letting him know that he was here.</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">My parents were both on the ground, dead, and then I heard him coming out of the kitchen. I looked up and felt myself frozen to the floor. I don&rsquo;t know how, but I somehow managed to fight him off, and next thing I knew I was running down the sidewalk with an aching pain in my shoulder. One of the neighbors must have called the police because I thought I saw them when I was running. Those moments are fuzzy for me, I really don't remember much at all, but I eventually found myself by the airport. I must have looked horrible,&rdquo; Ryan chuckled humorlessly. &ldquo;Some couple passed me and the woman stopped and knelt down in front of me. I didn&rsquo;t hear a thing she said, I just stared at her, and next thing I knew her husband was putting some money in my pocket. They asked me if I had any family around, and I don&rsquo;t know why I said it, but I said that I had some in Nevada. They bought my ticket and then I was down in Henderson, it&rsquo;s about twenty minutes away from Las Vegas.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">I don&rsquo;t know if I can picture you anywhere near Vegas,&rdquo; Eric said, hoping to lighten the mood a little. A smile formed when he heard Ryan chuckle slightly.</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">You say that now, but you didn&rsquo;t know when I was younger. My friend down there, Greg, he let me crash with him for a little bit. I don&rsquo;t mean that I knew him before I was down there, He actually caught me walking around on his way home from school one day. We talked on the way home and he brought me in and told his parents that I was from his class.&rdquo; Ryan nodded a little and smiled. &ldquo;He was trying to be a rebel teenager, but failing at it. I liked that about him, he kind of had this 'I don&rsquo;t care' attitude.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Ryan grabbed a stick from the ground and started tracing designs in the dirt. &ldquo;While he went to school, I found some odd jobs to do, make some of my own money. When I was sixteen I was able to trick a landlord into thinking that I was old enough to get my own apartment. I was actually pretty cunning back then, I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago, but still. Greg and his boyfriend, Nick, helped me manage my OCD, too. I really owe them a lot, especially Greg. I still keep in touch with him sometimes, he&rsquo;s actually a lab rat at the Crime Lab in Las Vegas, Nick is a CSI. I find it ironic that they work at the same place.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Now Ryan turned his head to look at Eric. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to anticipate the question you really want to know. Why couldn&rsquo;t you find any information about me in any public records, right?&rdquo; Eric blinked, caught a little off guard and could only nod. &ldquo;Those files you had were the original police report of my parents case. After two years they couldn&rsquo;t find anything, then suddenly the lead Detectives die and the papers get lost in the shuffle, then go missing.&rdquo; Eric raised an eyebrow, having worked a desk job while he was recovering he knew all about the process of files. &ldquo;I found them, when I was eighteen, and I kept them.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">It was hard convincing Greg to believe me when I told him about their murder. I showed him my shoulder, then the pictures and report. I think it really took him a while but he eventually believed me when he went to look up my personal records in the National Database. He said that someone had red flagged my information, so in a few hours, we eradicated any existence of my name and files. Ryan Michael Wolfe no longer exists.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Wait, you stole your own files, erased your own information?&rdquo; Eric&rsquo;s brow was creased in confusion.</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">You looked through the files, Eric, the only thing you saw was that they thought they saw me running from the scene. The only thing for sure was that I was missing. Someone had already gone through the trouble of making it hard for the police never to find out about me, or that I was their son. And I was pretty sure that the government or any officials were looking for me; I ran from the scene, they either thought I was another victim or a suspect. It was Praxon, the one who killed my parents.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">You know, I can&rsquo;t say that my life has been boring in the past year,&rdquo; Eric mumbled under his breath. &ldquo;And if I hadn&rsquo;t just met that demon, I&rsquo;d say that you were insane. What did you do after Henderson?&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000"">&ldquo;<font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">I went to California for a couple years, then came to Miami. I had decided that no one was going to find me, unless I wanted to be found. I obviously wasn&rsquo;t able to stay hidden enough, I mean look at the hell I&rsquo;ve raised in the last year.&rdquo;</font></font></p> <p style=""text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Eric snorted. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t really say that you&rsquo;ve raised hell. You&rsquo;ve just, led an interesting life so far.

"event","Note: This is the more political and patriotic you will hear me get.

Obama:
Well spoken man, well spoken. I was not a true supporter for the campaign, I wasn't really excited about it, because honestly I, at the beginning, didn't want either candidate to win. I was not thrilled, but I was going to vote for Obama, because we could not afford another Bush. I could afford it, the US could not afford it. But the last two weeks up until the election, I knew that I wanted to vote for Obama because he was also the best candidate, and then when I voted for the first time I knew that he had my total support.

Last night, honestly, I fell asleep before 11. I was woken up by a text, from Owen (<lj user=""theboysgonehome"">), I woke up and went to send a response, but it never got sent. I looked at it this morning and there was not a single word that was spelled right, but he sent  something along the lines of 297 AND THE WINNER IS. And my response, if spelled correctly, would have said something like 297 and they have Obama as the projected winner. Trust me when I say that if anyone else read that, you would Not have gotten that. The reason my text would have been like that was because I had been updating him all night while he was work with the numbers as CNN projected winners for the states. And I was still totally out of it and asleep, lol.

Anyway, my point to that was that I missed the speeches, so when I woke up I found them on CNN and watched them. And Obama is a truly well spoken president. At some points I was reminder of the many speeches that I have heard from the show The West Wing. And I want pictures of that new puppy.

McCain: A humble man who conceded. Humble for showing support for Obama, and for showing sympathy for Obama's grandmother when he in reality didn't have to mention her at all. I watched his speech and was proud to know that hi did not win, but more proud to know that he can be humble in defeat, and asked everyone to support and back Obama. But, and this is a Large But, his supporters at his speech were utter and complete assholes. I can't even think of a word to describe how horrible they were. You could even see it on McCain's face, when he mentioned Obama and they started to Boo him, they boo-ed Obama everytime McCain said his name, and never Once did McCain allude to having anything bad to say about him. I was appalled at the people at McCain's camp, and I at least give praise to McCain for staying humble.

On a side note, I'm watching The West Wing, and Leo McGarry has died (i know it's old, but i didn't watch the last few seasons, I didn't like it.) And I have to shed tears, because John Spencer was a great actor, and was perfect for the West Wing.
Edit// i cried for a good 45 minutes,a nd would have continued except that I had to leave int he middle of the episode that showed his funeral."

"event","So, Owen and I have seen our future, and in it we are the future ML's for the Ann Arbor and Toronto regions, lol. I am currently trying to organize some Saginaw Write Ins for Saginaw, and it's fun! Actually trying to organize stuff and the like, and getting things together.&nbsp;So if you're doing NaNoWriMo, or want to look into it, you should go to the site and sign up at<a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">NaNoWriMo</a>. Then you should go ahead and head on over to the Tri-Cities region on the forums, if that is indeed where you live, (either Midland, Bay City or Saginaw.)<br /><br />Short synapsis of NaNo for you NaNo virgins. NaNoWriMo= National Novel Writing Month. For the entire month of November (1-30) it is your goal to write 50,000 words. 30 days, that's all you have, and you can't do something that you've already started, it has to be fresh, it has to be new! Throw out any literary rules, just write your little heart away! And keep track of it all on the Nano site! This will be my fourth year doing it, once year i got really close to winning, but I've yet to win. Come do it! Please.....<br /><br />Anyway, for the month of Novemeber I will be.... weird-er. I will be typing any chance I get, there's a good chance that you can find me once a week at a write in, which is basically sitting around with fellow Nano-ers and typing away. Word Wars are always fun, too. But I will try to be on my computer more than I already am! Gasp, I know. Some headphones will always be attached to my head with my NaNo playlist&nbsp;(of which I need to make), and I will typing furiously in a vain attempt to win this year. I've already run through four ideas for NaNo, and I think I'm coming up on my fifth idea as I type. It's inspired by a drawing that I'm working on right now. When i get it done I'll post it. Damn.... i mgiht be changing my idea again. **sigh**<br /><br />Okay, well, wow, look at that long update. Well I'm going to disappear for a little bit, and either finish my drawing, or work on that fifth NaNo idea. I hope I can settle on that one idea before NaNo starts.<br /><br />"

With his past catching up with him and Eric along for the ride, getting home seems harder by the minute. But what other mysteries must Ryan uncover while in this alternate reality? What exactly is Kendrel's secret and how does it affect Ryan?<br />Author's Note: Since LJ is being a butt, I have to split this chapter up it seems ::pout:: so here's part 1!<br /><meta

"event","Okay, absolutely loved Miami last night, because it was pretty ridiculous. But still loved it.

So today, at school, while I was sitting and waiting for one of my classes to start I was sitting in the writing center. They have volunteer Professors who come in and sit there and will help students on papers that they're writing for classes. So one of them comes and sits at the table I'm at, and pulls out her Mac. There was another prof there and they were joking around and what not. Well, they both had internet problems so I tried to help them out, and so then me and this Professor sitting across from me start talking. I ask what classes she's teaching, and then she asks my name and I ask hers. Well, it turns out that she teaches a Literature of Mysticism class. Awesome! right? Well, I thought so, and I mentioned that I thought that sounded interesting, and then we started talking about Art History, and going to&nbsp;Europe. And she's really nice and what not, and I think that I will take her class. &nbsp;But she said that s he only teaches it int he Fall, so I'll have to wait until next year, and I need to get my English classes in before I take that class anyway, but hey! It's a class right up my ally, talking about stuff like that, and it's freaking awesome!

Also, I have one of the best brothers ever. Late night texts, and I know what I'm giving my little nephew who's due in 4 weeks. Little Eiken.

Well, I'm in the Delta library, so I'm going to go and seclude myself in the back of the library, crocheting a little blue baby blanket, until it's time to go."

"event","CSI Miami on tonight!!! and my baby Ryan plays a big part!! Finally! Now, I think it's time for a retrospective, of things that I have noticed recently.

Playful banter between Ryan and Frank Tripp.

""Oh, so you need help reading?"" -Ryan
""That's cute."" -Frank

Horatio has called Ryan Wolfe, Ryan, a total of two times that I have noticed, instead of ""Mr Wolfe""

Baby Ryan getting shot with a nailgun, and Jonathan Togo acting so well in that painful scene

And of course Eric Ryan shipping! How Calleigh asked how he had learned the computer so fast and he said that he was trying to hit on the new A/V girl. An omission yeah, she didn't fall for it, because he's gay! With Eric! Oh yeah!

anyway, off to class, CSI MIAMI! WOOT!"

I'm reading over old RP's, and i Start Fucking Crying. What the fuck, seriously."

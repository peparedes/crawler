Things are all so fucked up, and...here i sit..staring at the never ending mound of flash cards that i have yet to memorise. Things are just so crazy right now, i cant do anything right anymore. Even when i think im doing the right thing, it turns out the be wrong. Im so stupid..im ruining a relationship Ive had all my life for one i just gained. Im losing a good friend...and i feel as is i have not control over the entire situaion. I mean, i kinda dont...i dont know whats going to happen...how am i supposed to know that?? Why does everything always have to be so damn difficult?? Why??...i just feel as if i cant do anything correct anymore. I always fuck everything up..it was only a matter of time b4 i fucked this up too. And here i sit...fucking things up once again. I mean...should i just end all of this b4 it gets so intense and do screwed up that ppl start hating others?? I mean...this is my fault right?? Im the fuck up?? right??"

Wtf!!! 5 pg's the paper was 5 fucking pages long, the content was right i went to the fucking writing center...what more can i do you ask?? What more?? NOTHING! and yet i still got shit. Im so fucking sick of working my ass off and getting nothing! nothing in return for it! WHAT THE FUCK! Im so fucking sick of shit! All i try to do is be a good friend, thats it...and im made out to be the bad guy, how the fuck does that work!? HUH! how??... can you fucking tell me?? Cuz i would really love to know. I have come to the relization that life fucking BLOWS! Nothing you do is ever good enough, Nothing you do is ever right. You cant be a nice person, cuz ppl will walk all over you and find your weaknesses and use them against you! WHY would you do that to a person?? Why hurt someone when their down?? WHY!? And to top of this glorious fucking MONDAY, with the wonderful rain outside and being finals week!...i cant get on the internet on my computer, becasue some dumbass kid screwed it up! Downloading shit on my comp. when i wasnt here...didnt even ask to use my comp. in the first place, but then downloading shit. Telling me ""Im gonna download Coach Cater""....WHAT...NO THE FUCK YOUR NOT! So now becasue be downloaded a bunch of shit that didnt know about, im in the fucking penalty box! So here i am typing my life away on Allison comp. thinking that someone will read this and give two shits....but who the hell am i kidding?? No one will care...ppl only are about themselves and if it doesnt invlove them...GOD forbid anything be wrong. I get to stat work on Mon. the 9th...i am excited about that i will admit....but here you go Emma....heres your summer. Just more of the same thing...working your ass off and getting no where...you know the drill...ready go! GOOD FUCKING GOD IM SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!! WHY THE FUCK CANT ANYTHING BE EASY!? WHY THE FUCK CANT ANYTHING I DO BE RIGHT?! Its not my fault...this whole situation...(if you know me, you know what im talking about). You cannot pick and choose who you like...it doesnt work like that. I didnt do anything wrong, i didnt take him or anything...you chose to end it...not me. I wasnt even involved...i was a friend an innocent bi-stander that listened when he needed someone to, that was there when he needed someone to be. I didnt take him or steal him or making him cheat on you. You ended it, not me...NOT ME...i didnt do anything. You know im here for you, but you cant ask me questions i dont know the answer too, cuz i wont know the answer and ill tell you i dont know. Im sorry if that upsets you, if this upsets you...but you let him go and he needed someone to lean on, i wasnt going to leave him high and dry. He needed a friend, and all i try to do is be the best God damn friend i can be....the best...the kind of friend i would want for myself....thats all...and i get shit for it! IM GETTING SHIT FOR BEING A GOOD, HONEST, LOYAL, LOVING, CARING, LISTENING, FRIEND! IM GETTING SHIT! How does that work?? Are ppl so fucked up in the head these days that they dont know the difference between good and bad?? right and wrong?? GOD DAMNIT IM SO FUCKING PISSED AND JUST SO SICK!"

"event","Do you ever feel as if no one is listening?? As if no one sees you and or cares that your there?? They talk away like its nothing, leaving you behind...over looking the short one, the one who has a voice, yet is never heard. As if...you dont matter, nothing you say matters, nothing you do matters, and you being around...doesnt matter. Its all just becoming to much, everything....one thing after another...deja-vous...thats all i have to say. I mean, seriously....what else is to come?? Im so scared, i dont want the ending of this situation to be like the last. Leaving me high and dry to fend for myself...dropping me on my ass, after i was nothing but there. I cannot do that again, i cannot handle that, it will rip me apart..inside...out. Do you ever feel as if no one believes in you...no one believes what you do is right? They tell you what your doing is incorret...yet, all you feel is that what your doing is right...that what your doing is what God wishes of you? I feel as if, everytime i tell somewhat whats going on, they tell me what im doing...how im solving the problem, or approaching the situation is wrong. I mean, i know that im telling you to hear your opinion, but im not telling you for you to tell me what im doing to solve the problem is wrong. Im telling you to hear feed back of what you think i should do...not that what im doing is wrong. Or im telling you becasue i need someone..anyone to listen and im hoping that you will listen and be there for me. I feel as if im walking down a hallway and no one sees me, no one cares. I feel as if people are staring at me as if in this horrible plague...as if somethings wrong with me. Why the hell doesnt anyone care?? They all look at me, they all look right past me. As if my pain doesnt matter, as if i dont matter. Why do ppl look right past me and towards everyone else?? Do i need to get down on my hands and knees and beg for help?? Do i?? I mean i have to work my ass off for everything else in this world...why not work my ass off for someone to care?? Why not work my ass off 4 help?? I give up. I give up on trying to be loved, on trying to have a bestfriend...i have given up...thats it...im sick of begging, im sick of pleading..i give up. Thats just it, i give up."

"event","Sometimes, i hate growing up..Moving on, growing apart. Letting go of all those fond people of which you have grown with. Some leave, and move away..while others stay. You all part and go your separate ways. In a large way, its pretty depressing. But in another way, you know it has to be done, you know that in order to grow and learn you need to move on and meet new people. But do you really need to let go of those you have grown with, those you care and love??Its just hard i guess...really hard to think that i may never see them again. When i grew up with them, and everything we went through....now that were all getting older, were left with just memorize. Which in a way is a good thing, to remember all of the fantastic times, but in another way is horrible....becasue they can leave you so alone and heart broken...wishing for what use to be. I just miss it i suppose. I talked to one of my really good friends today, one of my friends of which i use to be so close with. And i realized how much i miss him, how much i miss our talks...how much has happened, and how our friendship has wilted these past few years. To the point where we barely talk...i miss him so much. I miss her so much...my little friend of whom i called to read poetry too. My friend of whom i called to create songs with. I miss him my best friend of whom i told everything too. The friend that i lost when i fucked up, I miss him. I miss it, the talks until 4am, the riding in cars screaming at the tops of our lungs to the music blaring from the radio...I miss it. I miss being young and naive...not having a care in the world...not having worries and stress and problems that you beat your brains apart just for a simple solution. Not having the heartache of love and distress...of loneliness and forgotten dreams...not having the worries of school and work. Not having to worry about what you want to do the rest of your life...having to pick what your going to do forever..until you die....picking that when your only 19 years old, and you still have so much more to learn. I miss it, i miss not having to choose between whats right and wrong...what will happen if you choose this or that...Not having to worry about every consequence that comes with doing anything. I just miss it..."

"event","After awhile, one starts to wonder...is this it?? It seems to me that everytime things are going well, or things are looking up...something makes it shitty again. Have you ever wanted something you couldnt have?? Or have you ever had something so great and fucked it up? How about not having any control over whats going on in your life...not having control on the fact that you want to be with someone...but cannot. There are just somethings and sometimes that suck. I ha ve basically given up on trying to make things better. No matter what you do, there will always be shitty times, thats the way things are.
And you know something that really gets to me?? You try to talk to people, you try to tell them whats going on, how your feeling, you basically just try to unwind...and all they do is jump down your fucking throat...telling you that what your doing isnt right! That your leading someone on. When you know in your heart that that is not right. When you are the only one who knows how you truly feel. And yet you still go back to the person asking for advice...and why do you do it?? Because your unsure, your unsure on what to do and you need someone to talk to, just someone to listen. So you go back, because your so sick of trying to get through it by yourself. And so you continue to ask, and listen to the shit they are feeding you back...even though you know its not the truth. 
I suppose i have jsut run out of ideas on how to make things better, how to not fuck up, how to make things right. Do you ever feel like everything you ever do just blows up in your face and then......you just dont know? Dont know how to make it better, dont know how to make things right...all you know is that your here, you have to get up in the morning and all you want to do is crawl back into bed and act as if your not here, and nothing is wrong??
Why do i allow him to keep putting shit into my head?? The hope of something happening in the future. Your saying this to me because you need comfort...not becasue thats what you want...becasue you need someone to run too, a convient friend everytime you fuck up. Every time you screw your life up more, you come to me...cuz you know ill be here! Thats it....you know im here, you know i will be, cuz you know i cant just walk away....Your not saying these things becasue you mean them...your saying these things to keep me around to lean on whenever you want. The truth....the truth is that every word that comes from your mouth means nothing...absolutely nothing to me. You so nothing but play me. push me around and make me feel like shit...about your problem...when i didnt even do it...you did it! It was your fault, and i feel like shit for it. I feel like shit cuz i cant be with you, i feel like shit! I DO!!!! Becasue of you! its you! its your fault! you fucked up not me! You did it! you feel like shit....not me...not anymore. Fuck this...if you want friendship..be my friend..if not...get out of my head, get out of my life, get out...just get out and stay out. I cant keep doing this..i cant tare myself apart anymore...its to much, its just too much. Something i had, i can never have again......thats it....thats what i have to live with, becasue you fucked up."

"event","You know, as you get older...you start to learn and see things. You start to learn that life, isnt all its cracked up to be. And you start to open your eyes to the world around you and see things..some of which you might not want to see. You see how the people around you change, sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse. I dont understand why this happens?...why ppl have to change..i guess it just comes with maturity, with old age. Sometimes i find myself wishing i could go back, back to a time when things made sense...where things were in order and i knew what i was doing each day and where i was going. Back to a time when i lived in one town and not 2. This whole growing up and realizing things...is getting old. I want to go back to a time when things made sense...when i knew who i was...back to a time when things were as they seemed."

"event","Do you ever not know what to say to someone in an awkward, horrible, or sad situation?? I hate it how that happens. Your  best friend is crying and you dont know what to say or do to make them stop, all you know is that you wish you could do something to help, anything to help. I dont know why that happens, its a human emotion to feel pain and heart ache, to feel bad for someone who is in pain, and yet...in some situations there is nothing anyone can do to help. Under some circumstances there is nothing one can say to make the one they care for that is in pain feel better. Then becasue you dont know what to say to them, you feel like a horrible person becasue it seems as if you dont care, when really you care more than they know and you just dont know what to say or how to make it better. Its kind of ironic how that occurs. 
   Do you ever feel alone in this world?? Like you will never find that one special person that will make you feel amazing? Do you ever feel as if maybe there isnt anyone out there for you, and you have been looking in all the wrong directions for nothing, becasue no one will ever come?? Are you ever scared that this is it, that you have no one and thats the way God intended it to be for you?? That God's intentions for you were to be a friend to the ones you care for and nothing more?? I dont know why this works this way, but to tell you the honest truth, it kinda blows. Im not saying there isnt anyone out there for me, im just asking...have you felt this way before?? Or am i being completely and totally irrational? Who know's, all i know is that i really need someone right now. Someone to lean on and to hold me hand.
   Do you ever regret letting something go?? Letting something that you know could have been so amazing go?? And now your left with the wondering question of ""what if??"" This i regretfully have to say that i have done. I regret so much for doing this, I was stupid, immature, ablivious and was just wrong for doing it. And the thing is, by being all of those things, i hurt the person i turly care the world about. And it hurts me so bad to know that we are not as close now as we use to be...and that is my fault. To not be able to talk to the person, beacuse you dont know what to say, becasue i know i fucked up, and the way we are now, the distance between us...is my fault. This at times is too much for me to handle. I have loved and lost, i have cried and hurt...but only one thing compares to this situation. Only one thing compares to how i feel for lossing what i had with that special person. The person i beleive i will always have feelings for no matter how hard i try to repress and block them out. 
    Have you ever wondered...""what if"". I sure have, and to know that the reason your wondering isnt because of you, and there is nothing you can do about it. To know that your wondering what if and you have no control over what happens next. Do you know what its like to be that ""one convient friend"" the one that at one point the love of your life runs to everytime people turn their backs on him?? Do you know what it feels like to hear that person say to you that he still loves you more than life and that he needs you in his life. And that he would rather have you in his life than not at all?? Do you understand how hard it is to say no to that?? To build up the strength and say...no...this time, i will not run to you when you call. NO this time i will not drop everything for you. No...this time i will not fall....No...not this time?? And you know...thats not even what hurts the most....what hurts the most is never knowing....never knowing what could have happened...and still wishing for another chance...even though, your not the one that fucked up. You still hope for another chance, because you love and acre for that person more than anything still, and....and all you want is him. All you want is for things to be how they use to be, when you were happy. You want it so bad that you drive past his house constantly...even though he doesnt live there and was kicked out. You still drive past it, becasue at one point in time, it was there that you two were together, it was there that your love flowed. You dirve past it and think...i would give anything for just one more day, I say all the words that i never said, all the things i long to say....Id through it all away...just for one more day. The thing that hurts the most, is not knowing what could have been...becasue deep down, i know it could have been unbeleiveable....for at a time...it was. 
    Do you ever want to beg someone to stop?? Beg them to stop hurting you and to let the piece of your shattered heart rest on the cold dead floor? Do you ever feel that you will never get past a situation that has occured. That the strength you once had has withered away to nothingness...becasue of everything that has occured?? Do you ever feel like you just want to give up? That you cannont go on...and no one notices until your at the stage where all you want is to be left alone?? Have you ever notcied how no one cares about anyhting but themselves?? That they act as if they care, and they act as if their listening, but their really not. And you find that so devistating to acknowldege, becasue you know all youve ever doen was listen and be there?? Do you ever feel as if not even your own friends give two shits?? Its as if your alone, and even though you have family and friends...when they dont listen.....you are alone. Alone with your own thoughts, because you get sick of talking to ppl that act like their listening to you. And you get sick of them acting as if they care. So you stop, and you keep everything in, and then they say to you, you shouldnt keep everything in, its not healthy...but what the real problem is...the real problem is the fact they wont listen and they have driven you to that point??....Did you ever think about that??"

Mind and soul gone, body left to wilt.
Emotions slip down me, as if I were silk.
As i gaze around everyones perfect, but not me.
Filled with imperfections, of me, thats all I see.
Trying desperately, nothing ever goes, thats it, this is the final blow.
Always stressed, can never get a break, sick and tired of acting fake.
Staring into the mirror, looking back isnt me.
I see a young girl drying to be free.
Eyes red and bloodshot as the tears continuously flow, head tilted downward, her face she cannot show.
Disgusted with the image, I turn away, repressing my emotions, as they continue to stay.
Hating myself, I let no one in, this time its done and over, I dont wanna win!
Tired of the fighting, sick of the fright, tired of things changing over night.

Not having you, still hurts, it still hurts....for once only once i would like to wake up from this nightmare in which im living. I would like to wake up once and be happy, feel ready for the new day and not dread what is to come next. Keith Urban is ruined for me, i cant listen to him.....hes so amazing and i cant listen to him....it hurts to bad. Everything you said, everything was nothing but lies and im the fool...your fool, for believing them, again im somones fool. When will it all end, i told you no, i cant do this again...i said no. Its like you wont hear me, its not they wont hear me, its as if no one will listen, no one will hear me out, no one wants to listen! They block me out....they block everything out, everything that is wrong with anything...ppl block out. I hate everything....turly i do...i hate eveything....i cant stand this life and everything thats in it anymore. I cant stand anyhting or any one anymore. I need to get out, to escape this hell hole in which ppl call life. Things are not as the appear, nothing is right anymore, i dont know anyhting or anyone, i dont know myself. This....this is not right, nothings right. I feel lost, i cant do this anymore, i cant go on, i cant move on....I wish to God i could get you out of my head! just get out!.....Juet go, leave.....erase everything all the memories...replace them with something, anything...just get rid of them, let me think of them no more. Music.....it haunts me, you made me realize how much i love it and now it haunts me.....The pit in my stomach does nothing but grow.....just leave....why couldnt you have just left?? Why did you have to come back?? Why did you have to come back only to haunt me with the memories that lie inside of me?? Just go! get out of my mind! leave me alone! leave me be, leave me to wallow in our everlasting memorise."

To the point where you feel as if you tell them what your feeling or whats going on, they will do nothing but criticize you and tell you that its not right? Tell you that the decision your making is basically the worst one by far that you have made yet? Most people just dont understand, then again..if they dont understand, perhaps they are not supposed too. There are many things in life that are unexplainable, things that do not have a conclusion or explanation in this case. Things happen for a reason they say, although when it is happening one can never see what that reason is, or why its happen or what for. The thing is, im sick of explaining myself, for everthing i do, in ever sitution i encounter, there is always an explanation that is needed. Fuck the explanation, im sick of explaining myself. If i am doing something, if i say something, i do it and say it for a reason, no questions asked. I dont need to explain my actions and motives to others. My word should be enough and others should trust in me enough to know that just my word....is good enough. I dont know what to do anymore, to tell you the truth, i just dont. Im so scared that im going to disappoint so many people around me. And me, im not one that normally cares what others think, but when it comes to family...i care immensely. More than anything in this world i want my family to approve, i want to make my family proud of me and above all i want to make them happy. There are too many shitty things in this world, i dont want to add to those things. I think that right there is the reason why i dont do things i shouldnt do. Why i was so scared in high school to end up pregnant, or a juvenile delinquent....i dont want to let my family down, i dont want to see them hurting, i dont want to be the cuase of their pain. And above all, i want a future for myself. I dont want to fuck up the rest of my life with a few stupid, selfish decisions that i made in high school. I know what i need to do in order to survive, and thats be true to myself, as long as i do that....i can stay away from most of the bad and horrible things in this world. Im tired, tired of hiding, tired of lying, tired of deceiving, tired of leading on, tired of the hatred, tired of anger, tired of the fighting, tired of the distance, tired of not knowing, and above all....im tired of feeling alone....as if no one understands....their all to busy with their own lives and situations to give 2 shits about anyone or anything else."

"event","Here we go again, starting fresh from the start. Gotta LOVE being the third wheel. It gets really repetitive after awhile, jsut to let you know. Its getting old and im sick of it. Everything...why is there the need to talk shit about people?? Why?? I guess i never got that memo, the one that says: when someone is being a bitch, talk shit and act as if your there friend, then when they stop, drop everyone else and go back to being that persons best friend. I guess that memo, i missplaced. Everyone does it, its everywhere and everytime its the mediator of the situation that gets dropped on their ass. You want to know who that is?? The mediator...yea that would be me. But hell, you'd think i would be use to it by now, considering as how it happens constantly in every situation that occurs. Wow! gotta love that!...Personally i dont think people should talk shit, i think they should think of how what they say about a person would make them feel if they were told that to their face. Personally, i think its a crock of shit and i dont like it. I know that im guilty when it comes to the problem as well, but i intend to quit that right now. I dont like it, no one deserves to be treated like shit, and im not about to make someone feel like shit, thats just something i cannot do. I cant treat others as if there nothing, although some people reat me that way.....i cant muster up the courage to do that to others, its not right. I dont care how pissed off you are, or how much you hate a person...no one deserves to be treated with no respect, and talked about...behind their back. 
      I cant beleive you dont trust me...what the hell did i ever do to missplace your trust?? When have i once lied to you, or deceived you, or made it so you could not trust me when i tell you something?? To hear you say to me, im having trouble believing what you say...to have you say that to me, when ive done nothing to ruin your trust...thats bullshit. You said it right to my face....right to my face, basically saying to me.....what your telling me is a crock of shit and i dont believe it for a second....that...that right there is bullshit. I did nothing wrong...nothing, but you insist on not believing me when i tell you the truth. I could lie to you, is that what you want?? Me to lie to you?..cuz if i did, then you would have something to be pissed off at me for, then this awkward silence and shit between us would make sense. 
      Enough of that, im so sick of people getting pissed off at me for the stupidest of reasons. When i do nothing wrong, ive been in a relationship before where i got blamed for every possible thing that went wrong, and im not....NOT about to do that again. I cant do that again, its not healthy and its not right. I dont even know at this point and time anymore, i just want school to be over with, i want summer here (even though...summer wont really exist) and i just need to get away...anywhere...just away."

Its amazing that one can feel stronger for a person when they are far away, then they ever did when they were right next door. That saying, ""You never know what you had and how you truly, feel, until you loose it""...that quote, i can say from personal experience is true. To tell you the truth, i only have myself to blame, for everything that happened. I know that it took two of us to screw it up, but i am truly, sorry. I cannot hide what i feel any longer, its got to come out, for until it does, i will never be truely happy. And the thing is, isnt that all that should matter to the people who truly, care for me??...I mean shouldnt my happiness be all that matters, no matter what occurred or happened in the part....shouldnt that be the only thing that matters?? Okay, so im gonna start being honest with myself and everyone else now. No more hiding how i truly, feel. I miss him...I do, i treuly do...without him i dont feel whole. Ever since that day, there has been a pit in my stomach, a whole in my heart. And up until a few days ago, for the life of me i couldnt figure out what it was, what was making it happen. Now i know and i understand that it was loosing him, that it was not having him in my life. I mean that is completely understandable for how long we were together. Something like that, something so intense and phenomenal doesnt just come into your life and walk out for nothing. Something like that....cant be let go, one cannot let something so amazing slip away...And me, this someone...wont let it happen. That is i wont let it happen again. Im gonna do things right this time, im gonna do my best. I know things can happen again, and workout...we have both matured an enormous amount. I've realized things, he's realized things.....Im still trying to process all of this that has been brought to me. All of the feelings and emotions that i have hid away and pushed aside. They are finally busting out, all over the place to be exact and i cant hide them anymore, they want out. To tell you the truth, im scared....scared of what people (my family) are gonna think. Im scared that they will not approve....Im not trying to jump into anything, but i have a feeling its gonna happen again. I have to set things straight, clear his name and clear up everthing that was said and done. I have to make this work this time, i just....have to make it work. I cant have him walk out of my life again, i cant do it, i just have to make this work, i just have too."

Thats it, thats life....a total waste of time. It feels as if no matter what i do, there will always be that one person that is better, always be that on person that knows more, that has to be right. What the fuck?? Can one never get ahead in this world?? Its really getting old and im realy quit sick of the situation at hand. Everything, no matter what i do.....never goes as planned. Thats also life, never going as planned. Im getting really sick of all of this. All the fucking people ALWAYS having to be right, and trying to tell me im wrong, when i know its right. Trying to tell me what im not who i say I AM....um i pretty sure i know who I AM rather than you knowing who i am. So i dont look it, not all things can be seen from the outside. Have you never heard...dont judge a book by its cover?? Yea...that saying goes into play alot in life. Why the fuck would you IM me?? Why? I dont want to talk to you anymore, its to hard too. You played me twice....not once...but twice! Do you really think im gonna let that happen again?? Come on think just a little bit i beg of you, use the brain i know you have. I was thinking that its ashame you didnt try out for that musical...cuz your a really good fucking actor. Damn!...did i ever figure that out the hard fucking way. Im fed up, sick to death of people, life, shitty situations, sick to death and just plain fed up it. Do you ever feel like everyone in the world has someone....but you dont?? Im feeling that alot lately. Maybe its the fact that i didnt pay attention cuz i had someone, but i have noticed that alot the past week or so. And its as if im invisible to everyone and thing. As if i dont even exist. Hell thats all i am a non-existing person nowadays. Why?! why do you insist on fucking with my mind? Playing with my thoughts?? Everytime im almost over you, you come back....Everytime i feel as if i can go on...you pop back into my life. This is not fair, its not right. You playing with my emotions, thoughts and mind. Thats not fair to me, i cant keep doing this shit. I will let it happen no more, for i cannot. I need to move on with my life and come to face the fact of reality that the future that you promised me....was nothing but shit. I need to come to the terms that you have a different life now, and that life im not apart of...i cannot be apart of it now. Not cuz i dont want to, but becasue ive been hurt to much and i cant do it now. You were the one who said forever, that you loved me and nothing...not even the situation you were in....could or would change that fact. You said that to me, you told me all of those things and then ripped them away...taking my heart with them. You.....you did this to me, and now i dont know who i am, i cant find me, i dont know what you did with me....but i want myself back. I want to be happy again, i want to laugh...i mean actually laugh again (not jsut fake it)...i want to smile again i mean an actual genuine smile. Give me back....i cant do this anymore, i need myself back...."

I dont understand why im acting the way i am....i feel as if im snapping at everyone, and i dont understand why. I feel like shit for doing it. Its as if im in my own little world, trying to escape the terrors of the real world and my life. I know that others have things way more worse off then i do, but dont you ever have just one of those days where you just dont know? Where you question everything and all your own motives?? Im very anti-social today to tell you the truth, that boggles my mind as well. Its as if im ignoring everyone that speaks to me. At least thats what it may seem to them, but im not...im listening, i hear them....im just emotionless....expresionless. I feel horrible for it, but there is not much i can do. I kinda feel dead...yea, you could say thats how im feeling today. Again.....not knowing why. Everything use to be so simple, so easy and free falling. Everything use to be right, i use to know what was going to happen next, who i was, what i liked, what i was going to do with my life, who i loved....now i dont know anything. I cant distinguish between whats wrong or right, who i love and lothe, whose true and whose dishonest. I cant see whats right in front of me...staring me in the face....saying, ""Emma, give me a chance, i wont hurt you"". I cant see it, because i dont believe it. I dont believe that i wont get hurt again, i know i will....no one can promise me they wont hurt me, because they will...some way or some how...i will get hurt again. And i know i will hurt others, thats how things work. One must suffer for another to strive and survive. Why do you think thats the way things have to happen?? Why do you suppose thats how God planned things out?? Why does pain have to be a part of everything?? Do you know?? Do you have a rough estimate?? Yea....me neither. All i know is is that i see way to many people hurting, and not enough people charishing life. I see way to many people crying and not enough smiling. I see way to many people angry with everything and not happy with the things they have. I see way to many people being selfish and greedy, thinking of only themselves and what they dont have rather than loving others and charishing all the things they do have. Like family, friends and loved ones. A home to live in, a car to drive, a job to keep food on the table. While the ones who have everything sit there and think about how they want the things they dont have. Others are starving without shelter and family. Without a job and security at night. While we sit here and complain....they sit there and wish to get through and live just another day. How would you live without family, friends and loved one?? Could you even imagin it?? I couldnt....thats for sure, they are what hold me together when times get rough. They are my everything, and without them...im turely nothing. Its not just what you beleive, what you like, and how you feel that makes you, you.....but its those who surround you as well. So next time you think....what else can i have? I wish i had more. Think about how it would be to have nothing....then perhaps, one will be greatful for the things he/she does have.

Without them, life would not be worth living. I know that no matter how rough things get, there will always be a silver lining. When it will come, what it will be, how it will come, who or what it may take the form of?? This i do not know. There is no way i could know, and i wouldnt have it any other way. I wouldnt want to know whats going to happen next, that takes the surprise out of the entire situation. I now understand and realize that i was nothing but a toy. A little play thing that someone used, messed around with and played with, while they were down. Nothing more than another story to tell the guys, another girl and or short story in the novel he is writing called his life. God knew that it wasnt right, and thats why i am where i am. Im not going to lie to you, it hurts, at times the pain from the memories and pictures are almost to much to take. But, thats alright, completely normal....its normal to have to need time to get through something that has taken a tole on you. I know that i did nothing wrong, that it was all him, and i also know that in the future...he will be the one regretting what he has done. Done not only to his own life, but the ones around him. What he has done to not only himself, but the ones who care and or cared for him deeply. Soon he will realize, when he matures, that he pushed away the best thing that could have happened to him. He pushed away a girl that would have stayed with him, despite the situation he was in, becasue that girl....loved him that much. He will soon come to know this, and when he does....its his own stupid acts and self realization that he will hate the most. As for the girl, i know she will move on, i know she will be okay...with time that is. Everything takes time, everything. To not know where to go from here, is really hard....Im feeling lost...but i know my family and friends are here. You know, to not call after all that has happened, that is by far the most immature thing one could ever do. Especially after all that has happened. You have done all of this to yourself, and the next time you come crawling back, and i know there will be a next time. The next time you feel like shit and like you have no one...the next time, that fact will be true. And then....then, your self realization and reality will set in. Once, only once would i try it again, and you blew that, way out of the water. You hurt me once, that was your fault, I let you hurt me again...that was my fault. Never again, will you hurt me now, no loner will you walk all over me. You.....your nothing but an asshole, now i've come to realize that. Im not even going to ask why you hurt me..it doesnt even matter. To tell you the truth, i dont even care. It doesnt even matter anymore, nothing that has to do or had to do with us matters....because there is no more us, there will never be another us again. I understand there hasnt been an us for awhile, but now its for certain...never again will i give you my heart to toy with, stomp on and crush. Never again.

There was something about you, it didnt fit the part.

"event","Somethings not right, im not right....no longer am i able to put up this fight.
My goals, wishes and dreams are flying out of sight. 
No longer can i do this, no longer is anything right.
I dont want to do this, im losing the fight....im losing when it comes to life. 
Filled with guilt, regret and strife, nothing i ever do is right.
One thing after another.....my tounge i do nothing but bite.
Bent and broken im rotting inside, not knowing whats yours from whats mine.
Inside out im withering and breaking, the pit inside grows only with time. 
My mind is confused, my bodies growing weak and worn, my heart, body, mind and soul are torn.
Somethings gotta give, things are not right. 
My strength and confidence left over night.
Getting up to another useless, drug out day...at night i do nothing but silently pray.
Tears unable to fall now, to many have flown...feeling useless, exhausted and alone.
Somethings not right, what have i done wrong?
I've done nothing but following the rules all along.
Falling freely, nothing to grab and hold on tight...falling alone, i slowly drift from sight.
Trying to grasp the edge, im being pushed...by everything and everyone I know.
Not giving me a break...shove me, push me, hurl me off the edge...right now i'd much rather be dead.
The pit is growing, taking over me....growing and pushing, theres nothing more for me to see.
confusion, loneliness, and depression on top of doubt...all i want is out.

"event","Im so sick of all of this. Its like i try and try and get nothing in return. It makes one start to think....why the hell am  even trying so hard?...just to get nothing but shit in return. Everytime...every single time in everything i do, there is always that one person that is better, that gets the better grade, that does a better job. Why the fuck do i even keep trying?? I get so sick of working my ass off and getting the ass end of the entire situation. Im so sick of working and getting shit, nothing in return. Why is it i can never get ahead?? Why is it that everything..i mean everything comes easier to everyone else?? What am i doing wrong?? I mean do i need to not study my ass off, cuz it seems to me the people thar dont go shit, dont study, only have fun get the better grades, get better everything. It seems to me the people that barely try excel more than i am...so is that it?? Do i have to stop caring and stop trying?? Cuz im really fucking close to that at this point in life. Im so sick of getting shit, being treated like shit, working my ass off to get nothing but shit....Im so sick of this life. Nothing is ever good, nothing is ever easy. Although for some things are easier than others. I know it may seem as if im doing nothing but complaining, but for God's sake you wouldnt blame me if you knew half the shit thats going on. And then to have people my ""friends"" get on my back about things that are happening, trying to tell me what i need to do, what im going through, who im talking about.....you dont know half of whats going on. Dont act like you do, you barely fucking know me. I thank God everyday for the true friends i do have. The ones that dont walk all over me and make me feel like total and complete shit. Cuz news flash thats what friends are supposed to do, not badger, or ridicule , or pressure, or scorn. Real ""friends"" are supposed to be there no matter what, no matter how the outcome occurs. A real friend doesnt sit there and say "" I told you so"" a real friend will comfort, help, and care for you no matter what, even if they were right in the end. A real friend doesnt rub the outcome in your face. Its to bad that friends like that are hard to come by, that just shows you what this world is coming too. Im just so sick of people thinking they can walk all over me, treat me like shit and use me as their very own personal door mat. Thats not gonna happen, no more will i let you walk all over me, no more will i let you treat me like the dirt under the sole of your shoes, no more will i sit back and watch you hurt me....no more. And, the whole everyone being better than me...thats getting old too!"

You know its relaly nice, knowing when one is only be nice to you for their own personal gain. And when they think they will get nothing...when that one person starts getting selfish and conceded, thats when it gets ugly. And that...that right there is when thier true colors shine through. It really pretty sad, thinking that no one will help anyone these days unless they get something in return, but then again, thats just how the world is these days. I cant beleive that you are pissed off because i dont want to have a converstaion. I have told you multiple times that i need time, a week.....is not time...a week is a week. I mean come on....you know how much this whole situation is hurting me, and at first....when you were getting something in return, you cared. And now that you think your not getting anything....your ready to give up, treating me like shit and being all pissy. Well i just have to say its nice to see your true colors finally shining through. I knew it was just a matter of time, thats normally all it takes. I dont know, i guess i thought you might have been different, i was obviously wrong. Who knows....i guess i just cant read people as well as i thought i could. You know its really a shame, at first i thought things would work out well, but i guess i was wrong. I mean for some silly reason, i thought that there was actually someone who was there, just to be there cuz i needed them....not for their own personal gain...Ha! shows you how gulable and blind to everything that i am. I dont know maybe its because i still look for the good in people, hoping that others still have the tiniest bit of kindess within them. Man was i ever wrong, and over and over again...ive been proved wrong. My hypothesis was obviously negative. Hmmmmm.....where to go from here, after i know what your really like, why you were kind and what you really wanted. Where to go, what to do....Its ashame, you know.....i thought you were different, i thought you actually cared....wow did you ever prove me wrong."

I need you, i cant live without, this whole thing.....no longer will i let it fill me with doubt. I know whats right, and deep down i know you and i are whats right. There will be no more of me explaining myself to others. There is no need for it, what i do, i know is right. Me being happy, thats all that should matter to my family and friends.

Who gets on their feet right away? No one. I understand that it will be hard, i know this. But he is worth it to me. I love him so much and all i want is to be with him. I will do anything for him, stick it out through anything with him and be there to do nothing but love him. I dont know how things will turn out, i dont know how we will make it through, i dont know what will happen in the future. But i do know i love him and i know we will be together in the end and we will make it through this together."

I cannot play around like this, i am unable to handle the situation and outcome that is present. How can you ask this of me?? How can you ask me to hide from everyone basiclly.

If you love me like you say you do if im your everything and you want to be with me for always and forever...then why cant people know?? You obviously dont love me as much as you think/say you do, cuz if you did, you would be yelling it at the top of your lungs. If you turely did, you would let everyone know that im yours and your mine. Why is that so difficult for you to do?? She has this hold on you that no one else does. Why do you give a shit what she thinks? Why do you care? If you have no feelings for her, theres nothing there, and nothing is going on between you two, why do you give a shit what she thinks!? Why are you hidding me?? Why do i have to be your ""little secret""? Why?? You called me, you said youself that you missed me, that you cant live without me and that you'd be damned if you ever let me go again. You said to me that how your making me cry makes you sick to your stomach. That how your hurting me is killing you. If it really hurts you that badly, how do you think im feeling?? What do you think this is doing to me emotionally and physically?? This is killing me, its ripping me apart and you cant even see that, your to focused on everything else. If it kills you that your hurting me, then why the fuck are you hurting me?? Why wont you just stop all of this tell everyone that we are meant to be?? I cant keep doing this, you toying with my mind has got to stop. Im emotionally and physically drained, i can no longer stand on my own. When i look at myself, i hate myself for what ive done, for who i am, for what ive become. I dont even know me anymore, i cant even see who i am much less anyone else.

I now know, that things are never what they seem, nothing ever works out as planned, and you never know what will happen next.

Silent tears which fall down my face, mark the scares I cannot erase.
Fill the void I'm unable to re-place, slowly falling, depressions line they trace.
Shaking uncontrolably, as i colapse to my knees, beging God to put me at ease.
Asking him to just stop all this please!
Cut off, let go...forget all the memorise.
Gasping for air, i can no longer breath, Knowing its not you and me.
Trying to breath, nothing comes in, My heartbeat stops...this could be the end.
Staring at nothing, lying on my bed, Nothings right anymore, I feel dead.
Family and friends dirifting far from sight, As I inch closer to the bright white light. 
Snaping out of it, I come to, still not knowing what to do, still unsure of how to get through.

Wishing and hoping for something that will never come, stuck in a dream that was finished before it begun.
Wanting you bad...so much that it hurts, Knowing my pushings only making things worse. 
Im not plaing this time...I never was, My mind was lost and caught up in the buzz.
Not having you is too much to handle, but i know the thought of me having you is nothing but a scandal. 
I need you, I want you, your all i think about...Everythings about you and how i can't live without.
I wonder if you can see this, I wonder if you even care.
I ponder whether you think of me, when im not there.
Pardon my eyes I can't help but stare, I'm sorry I can't help but run my fingers through your soft, brown hair. 
Not having you is becoming difficult to bear.
Im tired of this feeling of being incomplete, I feel as if again, our lips will never meet.
I'm sorry for being so straight forward and discrete, It's just that these feelings are unable for me to beat.
I can't do this, It's you I cannot live without.
I understand, I'm gonna have to wait......I'm just hoping for another chance....someday.

Feelings
Feelings of confussion and utter dismay, I know ill be better, happier someday.
Things now, they tend to be hazy, causing me to feel lost and somewhat crazy.
So many things, demanding and powerful...twisting and turning, everythings doubtful.
Hurting and Healing, pain and heartache...wishing and praying it will stop for my sake.
Not knowing who to turn too, run to or where to go, making things difficult and hard to throw. 
Wanting nothing more than a day of nothingness...a day of nothing but pure happiness and bliss.
The world itself...doing nothing but pushing this.
Far from sight, it drifts away...making me long for those fun chilhood days.
Growing up, so hard to do....makes one wonder if they'll ever make it through.
Make it through the day, just one...its only one....only to go home and pray for the one to come.
Not knowing...im so unsure, wondering if your focused only on her.
Who am i kidding??...theres no chance in hell...Emma...don't wish those words....he wont tell.....
Ahhh!...I can't stop thinking, there are so many things...nothings ever anymore as it seems. 
You know....all this, i give up...I've never b4 felt so stuck.
Confusion, frustration, wishing and loss...all of these things i can no longer toss.
Thats it, i give up...can't i just quit?...for i know its him that i'll never be with.

Not really find...more like remember who i once was without someone. Its hard, the whole not having anymore. I know i cant do it, im a pretty stong person, always have been. It just really difficult to let go of something that has meant so much to you. To let go of something you thought would have lasted this time. Out of all of this, I've only figured out that i made the wrong decision a year ago in letting go the one person i turley care for and have long lasting feelings for. But do i dare tell this person and screw up what he has too?? No, i cant do that to him, all i want is his happiness and if that means me only being his friend...I guess thats what it has to be. You know, i cant even think about having another boyfirend right now, everything...every memory hurts to think about, every spot/place we were once together hurts to think about or see. I love home, i truely do....but its hurts so unbelieveably bad. There are so many memories, so many given up dreams, so many wonderful chances that i let slip away. So many people that i miss and love so dearly. All of this is becoming too much, i cant do this anymore. I think i need to move....everything is so messed up, it feels as if it will never get better.

Trying to push and push for what you want, when thats not how life is, in life one needs to be paitent. I understand this fact, but when feelings overcome you, they overcome all of you. They take you by storm, and if their strong enough...they affect everything around you. Making things happy or sad, your day good or bad. When emotions and feelings find you, theres no escape. This maybe hard to understand i know im the only one who truely knows how i feel. But when you dont know how to feel, then what?? I know what i want....that is not the question. The question is whether or not i will get it, whether or not i will have the opportunity to have that chance again. I know these things cannont be rushed, for that i understand. I just wish someone would hold my hand. I say i dont want to get my hopes up, but they are already gone.....flying amoung the clouds. There up there alright, far from sight, far from my grip....i cant pull them back down. Its like, no one understands anymore...things always have to become so complicated.

No one knows how im feeling, and i dont blame them, its not their fault. This is mine, i set myself up. You played me, you used me to escape reality, you told me things that i had never heard before, you did that to pull me in. You knew it would work, every girl wants to hear the things you told me.

You were only here becasue you needed someone, and you knew you could use me and take advantage of me, you knew it...so you did. Why?? why would you do that to me?? I dont understand, how could you use me like this?? I feel so lost, like i will never find the one im supposed to be with. I feel as if there is no one out there for me, you've left me with nothing. You had my heart and broke it, now im left with nothing. Not even a farwell kiss, a swift good-bye, not even a ""i dont think we should be together anymore""....nothing........wtf?......Im just sick of it, im sick of being stressed out, im sick of not knowing, im sick of everyones shit, and im sick of looking at life as nothing but shit."

Use me for a ride, use me for money, use me for someone to lean on when they need it. But as soon as i need something, the ones that im there for are the first ones to get up and walk away. The one that i gave a ride to is the first one to say they cant come pick me up when im in need of assistance. The one that im there for with money is the first to say, i dont have the money to help you right now. The one that im there for, helping them get through the roughest time in their life....a shoulder for them to cry on, a friend thats there. They are the first to walk away when i need someone there. They are the first ones to up and leave when all i need is for someone to listen. What the fuck?? Thats not how friendship is supposed to work. Somehting is seriously wrong with this picture. Dont call me your bestfriend if all your going to do is stab me in the fucking back. Dont sit there and act like im your friend when all you do is talk shit. You know, beleive it or not, i know who is talking about me and what they say. Why do you think i dont talk to you??....Why do you think i dont tell you anything anymore?? You've ruined my trust, its gone. I dont understand why there has to be secrets....if someone is your bestfriend, shouldnt you be able to tell them anything?? I thought thats how it was supposed to work. I guess im mistaken huh?? I just dont understand this anymore, i dont understand people. Im sick of the ones that i care for most walking all over me, im sick of the ones that are supposed to be helping me hurting me the most.

Ill admit, i am selfish at times, but some people go way beyond sometimes. Seriously..give it up, things are never ""okay"" they never will be, something bad with always come with something good.

How the fuck does that work. O yea technology is so great....and yet it cant give me a simple request....paintings! by Monet! Gosh!.....All i needed was the name to one of his paintings and i cant even find the fucking things, becasue everything else in the world pops up. If its not the annoying pop-ups, its the other usless shit that im not looking for. I guess that just pushed me over the edge. Besides my ""boyfriend"" of whom isnt really my boyfriend anymore, not talking to me, i mean how are you supposed to have a realtionship without communication.

Someone once told me....when one door closes another will always open, ive come to know that this is true. Alothough something spectacular ends, how is one supposed to know the next thing to come will not be magnificant?? No matter how bad things get...I will always have friends and family. The ones that will love me no matter what..whose love is unconditional. Things happen for a reason, maybe my job here is done. Perhaps I've out lived my welcome. It might be that God gave me to you, to help you through the hardest time that you've seen. Perhaps i was a form or your gaurdian angel. God does things for a reason. And like you always said...he will never give you more than you can handle. God obivously thought that i was strong enough to help you as well as myself. And for that i am glad that i could be here to help you through this burden in life. I am so happy that things have turned out well for you. Now, as for myself...i need to find myself once more.

"event","Today....was basiclly just another day. Well...not counting the rain/hail/snow/thunderstrom we had going on early up here. It was so sweet!...i mean there was a thunderstorm in February! How awesome is that! They cancelled classes, just my luck it was after i went to my classes, but what are you gonna do, thats how it normally works out..you know? Anyways, today hasnt been so bad, I mean i find myself still thinking about things, but who doesnt. I just cant let it get to me too bad, becasue thats when things are no longer happy, and whats life without happiness?? Every sec. i spend sad, is another min. of happiness i can never get back...right? I mean theres no point in prolonging the inevitable. I know its going to happen ,i know its coming, i think he does too. Theres no point in running away from it, and not calling me and or talking to me. I mean im going home this weekend to talk about things the situation mostly and just see whats going on. Because to tell you the truth, im kinda lost. I mean how in tune am i supposed to be, when i never get a phone call and no one ever picks up when i call?? Normally after so many times of someone not picking up, one kinda gets the point and stops trying to call. Then you tell me that i need to call you more...becasue you dont want to be the only one, always call me...but you dont pick up the phone...hmmm. How is that supposed to work? Hell its probably my fault, most things seem to be these days. Im sure you can find away to blame it on me, you normally always do. I cried today..i mean i actually shead a tear...for the first time in i cant remember when. I dont know why, i think its becasue im finally realising whats happening, whats going on and what God has in store for not only me, but you as well. I think it was becasue im finally bracing myself for the one thing ive been trying to prevent these past 7 months.....facing reality. Facing the fact, that you have more important things in your life now, and that they need you more than i do. I mean dont get me wrong, i need you too. But the things you have now...will always need you, and as for me...well ive figured out and realized that if i absolutely have to...i can move on. As of right now, i dont know what will happen, what will come out of this situation, or what will even happen tomorrow. I do know that im going home for the weekend for the first time in about a month and a half. I miss my family and even if i dont get to see you and i sit at home all weekend and do nothing, well that is quite alright with me. I miss them so much, and i have also come to know that not only are my friends my support system. But my family is the one strong, sterdy, supporting, loving, empathetic, sympathetic, compationate, and giving support system i will ever have, one that will always be there no matter what happens in my life. I dont know what will happen tomorrow, or the next day...some will come into my life and some will choose to leave. I dont know who i will fall in love with, who will steal my heart away, who will break my heart, i dont know how i will do on my exam. But what i do know is that i will always be me...i will always wake up looking forward to the new day that lies ahead. Whether rain, snow, sun, hail, thunderstorms or everything combind, i will get up and walk with my hear held high. Because, life is to short to be angry, sad, regretful, hateful and mad.....I will only live once and i intend to live life to its fullest."

"event","Today....is not the greatest of days...All day ive been so exhausted, i almost fell asleep in about every class i had today. My body is finally beginning to break down from everything thats going on. Its hard to get up in the mornings now....i just sit there and think to myself..whats the point of getting up and going to class today??....its going to be just like yesterday and the day b4 that...shitty. Im just not up to par today, things....nothing seems interesting or exciting anymore. I just feel so lost, im so confused and alone, i just dont know what to do anymore, im so alone and gone. Staring off into space....i think of noting at all now, i jsut sit and stare....sometimes i drift off into a day dream, other times i think of nothing...and most times, nothing but him and how long its been since i've seen him, kissed him, touched him, huged him, looked into his eyes.....how long its been since i ran and jumped into his arms....I've forgotten what how vibrant and enchanting his bright green eyes are, i've forgotten what that tingle feels like when we kiss, forgotten how it feels to laugh out loud....I've forgotten. How could i forget anything that deals with us? How?? I told myself that would never happen, you promised we would never fall apart. I just hope to God you have not forgotten me...I hope and pray to God for that....everything is so fucked up... I dont know anything anymore. Absense makes people forgetful, i now know that it doesnt make the heart grow fonder, but it makes the heart forget. There is a pit in my stomach...a whole in my chest where my heart once stood. Nothing can fill the pit or whole except you. If this doesnt work....i dont know what i would do....i cant live without you. God help me for even thinking that we may not work....but i cant run away from reality forever...this is reality and there is a chance of me lossing you...this i know. I dont think its becasue you want to lose me....or i to lose you, i think its because there is so much on your plate right now, your having trouble juggling it all. I jsut really need to go home, i miss my family and friends there. I miss my kitty.....I miss having him there. I was once your everthing...your wife...i was once in your life....now im nothing more but another shadow on the wall....my heart has been stabbed with a knife. Can you see me at least!? Do i still exist to you?? Or have i fallen from your vision as well...has your everlasting love for me come to a halt?? I dont know...i just dont know, im at a loss for words....all i know is i need you in my life, i need to be your wife. This isnt going to be easy, we both knew that going in.....but please baby...please i beg of you, dont let us come to an end.....your my bestfriend. All of this is getting so repetative, this i know, but i cant help but let my feelings show....to hold it isnt an option anymore. Thats all i ever do now, for you....so i dont upset you, but i cant keep it in anymore, i need to let it out...i need to talk about this i need to scream and shout! Please listen! please....i have for you....i need you too....I hope to God im getting through."

"event","Do you ever get to the point in life where everything is to fucked up all you want to do it break?? Do you ever get to the point in life when you dont know if you can do it anymore, and the feelings of lonliness tend to seap in?? Its getting to the point where it is so hard. Not having you, not seeing you, not being with you. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel so alone, like i have no one. Although i know people are here for me and i know they care, no one can understand us....except us. No one can understand why im taking your shit.....no one will and no one can, only us. All of the things you have said to me, and i to you...I thought that couldnt just disappear. You told me, you promised me we would be together, you promised it would work out. I beg of you please, this is the one promise i need you to keep the most. I cannot bear the thought of lossing you. I cannot fathome life without you. Im sure of anything anymore, i dont know what to do, where to go, who to turn too. I just dont know. People ask why im still with you, why i even bother, when you say those horrible, nasty, uncalled for things to me. But all i can say is you dont understand....they cant understand....baby, im breaking down here, i need you! Please i beg of you, humble yourself and talk to me.....they dont understand what our sayings mean, they dont know what the words ""i love you"" mean, or ""tiny toot"", ""143 bright eyes"", forever means forever""......The whole inside me does nothing but grow....being filled with dark, empty aloneness every second of everyday, every time you forget to call back. All the times you blow up and take things out on me..... I dont know why you dont want to see me, thats all ive wanted for the past month, was to see you, to run and jump into your arms again...to hear the words..your my everything pour from your lips....but lately, all i feel as if that dream and or hope is far fetched at this time. You dont even call me...this from the man who said, i will never go a day without talking to you, and now you'll go days without even calling me....that give me the impression that your not even thinking of me.......Everythings so fucked up...theres just to much to bear...."

"event","I dont know where you get off saying that shit to me. No one deserves that. The ""Central Slut""....thats a good one, real mautre and everything. I mean come on, why the fuck would you say something like that, especially to someone you ""love so much"" and ""means the world to you"", your ""wife""....calling me a bitch and a slut and saying that im ""fucking"" all these other guys. Let me tell you this right now.....let me set you straight. A relaionship is based on trust, turst and if there is none, it will not...i repeat....WILL NOT work. Im not going to sit around here letting you treat me and make me feel like shit. Its not going to happen, thats not how things work. Im sorry but noone deserves this and im not going to let you do it to me. Okay, so i cant be mean, personally i think im a fairly nice person, but that doesnt give you the right to walk all over me and take me for granted. When you push and push and push me....i will explode, dont think i wont. Im sick of this hiding me and shit, no one needs it, i dont need it. I already have enough shit to deal with and enough stress, i dont need this and i dont fucking deserve this. Another thing dont act as if im being a bitch towards you when im not, beleive it or not if i dont want to talk, im not in the mood to talk. If you want me to be a bitch i can be, maybe then you'll actually have a reason to call me one in the first place. The way your treating me is totally uncalled for and i dont need that shit on top of the shit i already have on top of the shit at home. At one point this is going to become to much, this is why people fucking crack. Because others a stuipd, petty, rude and numb to feeling. Believe it or not, i have feelings too, this situation is affecting me too. I dont need you to sit there and call me shit or talk shit, i need you to be there for me, like i have done nothing but for you for the past 7 months. To say you dont want to talk about it im your escape, thats not right, im supposed to be part of you, not just an escape from reality, i should be apart of your reality. If i cant talk to you about the situation who am i supposed to go to for help? I can only pray so much! God will only listen to me for so long, after awhile the prayers will just become tedious and God himself will tell me to move on as well. I dont want to move on, beleive me i dont, but you may be leaving me no other alternative."

"event","Do i really deserve this?? Is this how you think one should be treated?? Because if you ask me, i think you are greatly misunderstood. No one deserves to be treated like shit.....to be mistrusted, to be acused of acuzations when one has no proof of what is happening. Do you really think it is right to patrionize, harrass and verbally abuse someone that you ""love and care for?"" I dont think any one of those things fits into the deffinition of ""love"". Im so sick of this...its come to the point where tears, they no longer fall,come to the point where im so angry with everything and everyone that all i want to do is bawl....but i cant, for the tears do not fall. Im so sick of being treated like nothing but the dirt beneith peoples feet. Do i have a rug on my forhead that says.....WELCOME! come step on me and whip all your shit off on me?? Its not right for people to treat other human beings like this...Its just not. I dont understand how you can say you love me and then treat me like this. What is love without trust?? One cannot have a relationship without trust, love does not exist without trust. You sit here and question me, when really in all actuality, I'm the one that should be questioning you. Always with her, never calling, not giving two shits on whether im okay. Not even worrying if im okay, but jumping to the conclusion that im cheating on you, that im with another guy. Yes, guys look at girls, that doesnt mean you need to flip a nut everytime a person so much as talks to me. Why cant it be back to normal, how it use to be? Then again who is to say whats normal, maybe this is really you, maybe this is your normal and i was just to blind in the beginning to see it, or you were just too well at covering it up. I wish that you would stop being and acting to imature, quit acting like your in middle school and actually have a relationship with me. I mean a genuine, trusting, caring, loving relationship. Is that to much to ask for?? Quit hiding me, quit puching me away, quit mistrusting me, stop playing games with me, stop verbally bashing me, and just stop treating me like shit. I dont need it, no one needs it and no one should have to put up with it. I dont know why i still am. Love is blind they say. then again they do say that absense makes the heart grow fonder, but i think thats an understatment.....to me absense doesnt make the heart grow fonder, it makes one grow forgetful. It makes one forget all the things they once said, all the promises they once made. It makes one say and do things they normally wouldnt do, or at least things you think they wouldnt do. I have dont nothing but been here for you, done nothing but put myself out to help you and make you happy, and you cant even give me the time of day. Not even two seconds out of each day to call and say...how was your day?...how are you doing?? you hanging in there, while you carry all my BAGGAE! yea baggae! You cant give me 2 sec.....2 fucking seconds! thats all i need, thats all i want is for you to listen and not say, i cant talk about it with you, you are my escape. I need to talk about it, i have too. If i cant talk about your own problem with you, then who can i talk too? I need you there too, isnt that how a realtionship works, both ppl being there and helping one another, caring for one another. When you have done nothing but been there for someone through the worst, giving them a shoulder to lean on and cry on, someone to talk to, someone to ""love"" and they are not there for you, then what do you do? where do you go? who do you turn too? Im lost, i dont know whats going on, i dont know who you are anymore. I dont know who i am. Dear Lord i am questioning my own strength. If you know me, you know that never happens. Im just to the point where i dont know if i can do this anymore. Im not sure of anything, not sure of us, not sure of you, hell im not sure for myself. All i know is that no matter the outcome of this situation is, good or bad.....I will always be Emma, and i have yet to figure out if that is good or bad yet.........."

I have still yet to figure out if i want to stay up here again this weekend or go home. I do miss my family, cat and friends back at home....Who knows. I know if i dont go my mom is going to give a this giant guilt trip, cuz im supposed to go to the Lion King this weekend. So then i will feel bad if i dont go home, but i also have a shit load of homework to do, and i know i wont get it done if i go home....Well i might, but i dont really feel like carrying all the homework and laundry home...when i can do it perfectly well up here. That doesnt make sense to me...okay so i have to pay for laundry here, but i dont want to carry it all the was home to wash it then bring it back...haha....not gonna happen. Lately things have been so fucked up...nothing is normal anymore, its like i know nothing. Im listening to Linkin Park right now.....i love these guys.....you know what i need to go get money out.....hmm......I dont know what im saying, im bored and im sick of doing homework and shit.....So i bascilly talking about nothing becasue i can :) and cuz this is my journal so i will say what ever the hell i want. :) hmmmmm......what could i do???

"event","This whole thing, its starting to get to me. At first i thought, it will be okay, i can do this....im strong. Well now all i do is second guess myself, thats all i ever do, i find myself questioning my own strength, and if you know me, you know thats not like me. I dont know what it is, my appetite is completely gone, there are some days that i just want to sleep all the time, and others where i cant sleep at all. I guess i just dont know what i need to do anymore. I cant wait forever, i mean no one should have to, thats just not right. It helps me to not think of it, i cant think of the fact that we might not work. But then again in the back of my mind that thought sits....just sitting, lingering...its like its waiting to come out and be said. I dont know what im supposed to do, i feel like ive done all i can. What i dont understand is i was there for you, i gave you a helping hand...but wheres mine?? Its as if im giving and getting nothing back....thats not how this is supposed to work. I cant wait for a phone call forever, i cant watch the game from the stands forever, being hid and kept secret behind the crowd. One day i have to come out...or this will not work. Im sorry if this seems selfish, or pushy or wrong....but sometimes one has to look out for themselves as well. I know its not an option right now.....thats not even it...i dont understand.....it makes me think as if something more is going on, as if you ""more then friends"". I know you have to be, but theres a fine line...are you crossing it...or staying mine??i find its easier when you dont call, that statement i find as true...so instead of saying ill call you back, jsut say you'll try....dont say i promise and turn it into a lie. What are you hidding? Am i even here?? O Lord help me this is what I've feared......."

God is the only one in this shitty world that knows what will happen in the future. In the mean time, ill do the only thing i can do, sit back and watch the ride......the ride being my life. I have no control! This is so hard, concidering as how im a control freak, not having control of my own life, is killing me. Gosh...I dont want to study for this exam......i just dont, ive been doing stuff all morning and im always so worn out on Sun. cuz i do way to much shit. I cant do anything to get my mind off of it anymore.....it creaps everywhere, into my dreams, daydreams, everyday life.....the thoughts never go away...kinda like it will never go away. I just dont know what to say. Someday i know it will all be okay....with or without him, i know it will be okay....it has to be. I know hes the one, but if we are not in God's offical plan, i know it wont workout. God help me for saying that!.....i cant even imagine that thought, but i cant run away from my problems, and i have to face the fact that, that may happen. If i dont, it will hurt more when it does. It hurts so unbelieveably bad right now, all i want to do is die, but i know i will be okay. I just hope and pray to God, my savoir that he and i will stay."

"event","I've gotten to the point where I no longer feel anything....Im in that state of numbness that people reach when they no longer know what to do with or are unable to deal with the emotions they are feeling. Im in the state where I no longer pay attention to whats going on and i basiclly reject my emotions, pushing and locking them out completely. I know this is not the best way of handling the situations that are going on in my life, but i dont know any other way, to deal with things at this moment. Right now painting on a face and acting happy is easier than talking to people about things, becasue i know people start to get annoyed with my same worries and same feelings being told to them over and over again. So i think this is just better for everyone this way. I....to....to tell you the truth i just dont know what to do anymore right now....I dont even know how im supposed to feel. I totally underestimtated my feelings in this entire thing, and im kinda in a rut. To tell you the truth i just wish there was a hole that i could run and hide in....so i could just cry and let it all out. But i know that is impossible....there is not such thing. But what i dont understand is why life isnt getting better and why all it does is get worse. I thought things were supposed to get better.....not worse. I guess this is the one true test....testing trust, forgiveness, kindness, love, strength and ability. Ability to get through and be stronger or the ability to fail.....and God help me for saying this....move on.....I cant picture myself doing that, i know its not right, but if i have to hide forever in the shadows i will have to move on....No one sould have to do that, no one should have to be a secret. God what i would give for you to just say my name aloud....to just hear Emma I love you and want to be with you forever...you are my wife,....and to let them hear it too. I dont know, maybe im being a little too harsh, i know there is alot going on right now and the last thing i want to do is be part of the problem. For someone that is my everything i will do anything for you. Just know that im here....im just not sure how to handle this right now.....or how to take whats going on...how im supposed to react when i know its her your with constantly and not me like it use to be....It makes me sick to my stomach....the thoughts of why they dont know about me.....it makes me think..what are you trying to hide?? Why are you hiding me in the shadows??It makes me hope to God that we are still right."

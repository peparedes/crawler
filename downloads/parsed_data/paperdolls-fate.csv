And it is possible for a human to survive on nothing but natchos and cheese.

In other news, I  have like zero cools clothes, I know how i wanna look in my head, but I don;t own any of that stuff. So its a good thing I'm going to the mall today with a chick that loves to shop lol. I have a feeling i may get bored soon and she will drag me all over. Oh well, walling = skinny brad.

My parents came back from vacation yesterday and they got me a sirt that has a liger on it, and a carton of du maurs. yay smokeing = happy brad and skinny brad, but also cancer brad.

"event","So Brad is Dead tired. Ughs. I had this dream last night, and it was basically like, this mike guy at school was in it, and he was like.... saying he wanted me, and then he would pretend he never said it, anywho i ended up getting super mad and pushing him into a filing cabnit but anywho. It just made me think like, I've never been in a relationship. And now that i hang out with guys, it makes it that much weirder. 

The guys are straight mind you, but there awesome non the less, and they are comfortable with there sexuality o there not ""ew gay"" at all. But yea, Its also weird because im like the only one of my friends thats singel, and that just makes me feel like a third wheel. 

Like when i was at robs house the other day, we were all in the dark for like 4 hours, don't ask, but jeff nd dana were makeing out, taylor and ains were makeing out, and rob was hitting on this roxy chick. SO i was just sitting there, and i just got totally depressed. The comeing down of special k didn't help but yea, i was just so.... angry.

Like, im not that unattractive, and i have lots of friends so its not like im not funny/caring/whatever. I blame the bulck of my lack of love life on where i live, but even so, all the guys i have met, like, theres not even a second glance at me. I think i missed something living in a small town, something that al the other fags know about, and i don't, i feel like im the tall um-pa-lum-pa in the willy wanka world."

""So much depends on time-a beast that rules with iron claws and a terrible call, people who think they can escape are fools. Theres nowhere to run and so far to fall. There is not a Spring og Eternal Life. Nor a way to travel about in time. No parrying the strike of times dark knife. Time is natures law, challaging (terms, items, im not sure about that word) Time is your master and time is your slave. Chained to him as he strides on without pause. No change of pace, you are bound to behave by invisible chains and glang claws. But what you do with time is up to you, the possibilities are never few""

""i need you to come pick my up, i just got fired""
mom: ""what, why""
Me: ""apperntly i stand around to much"" *voice cracks trying to no cry and look like a retard in front of everyone""* ""just come get me"" *hangs up*

then the boss came in

boss: ""you pay will be ready thurday""

Me: ""whatever"" *walks outside and wait for me*

then i had a bath a cried like a retard, its one thing to call yourself a failour and think your not good for anything. but then its anothr thing for somoene else to tell you that its actually the truth

whatever, apperntly i can;t even keep a fucking job for more the two days. Can;t wait to see what my future is like, prob end up as some crack whore that gets raped and dies, well... one can only hope."

"event","So I lasted two days kids, two days in hell befor I can't take it anymore. I'm never going back to bicks again. I spent much of last night being yelled at for things I didn't do. I almost got fired twice, Time number one
random worker guy:""are you on clean up?!""
me:""yea...""
random worker guy:""well your not suppose to have break with everyone else you know! you stay back and help us clen the lines then we have break after!""
me""..o...k..""
random worker guy:""thats three times now you have taken break when your not suppose to! I should fire you you know!""
me:""...sorry""

Then, line 2 *the line i clean up on* broke down for like an hour, so the line leader chcik told everyone just to clean up. Now bicks has a very strick colour codeing system for garbage, all i fucking know is cucumbers in the green bins, and glass and shit in the red bins. But the other people donno this so they just threw the shit where ever. and then like an hour later the line leader comes up to me.

line leader:""Do you know where everything goes??""
me:""yea""
line leader:""becasue the garbage people said they have been getting alot of stuff in bins thats its not suppose to be in, we are serious here about our colour codeing! If you choose not to pay attention to it then I'm going to hve to let u go""
me:""um... I'm pretty sure that that was from everyone else, when you told them all to clean up""
line leader:""oh... well just make sure you know where everything goes""

So...FUCK YOU BICKS!

I told my parents, ""im not going back there, i don't care how mad you get"" So they donlt seem to mad, but they are all... ""your finding a new job starting tommorw!"" In act they alrady had me call about some chicken farm job but the spot was filled so....

Now all i care about is if i don't  show up, will i still get my two days pay of like, 140 bucks."

"event","Oh...MY...GOD! So I worked at Bicks last night, first time, midnight till 8. It wasn;t hard to stay awake.... but..I had the shittyest job EVER. Everyone else just like, stands there and does something super easy and boring, but nooooooooooo not me, I have to fucking Walk around with this like, trolly thing and a bin on the bottom, and go to the places where people on the lines are standing, and when they find bad cucumbers, they throw them into these  bins on the floor beside them, and my job is to empty all there bins, and these bins are fucking huge! omg.... I can't even tell u the pain im in. So for th first 2and a half hours, i didn't stop. I just kept walking back and forth... back anf forth.... and then break. so i go to the break room and I just like.... died...and then when we went back to work... i was so slow, and the line leader was like, if you get to hot you can go stand by that door, *points to a huge door with wonderful clean oxygen blowing in. so i did. throught the night i started takeing more and more breaks, but i didn;t fall behind on my job,  im pretty sure the line people got lazy and just stopped throghing out the bad ones, so it seemed that... everyone on my line was done at 7, so.... i slipped out with them, and i just sat outside for an hour, and then swipped out when it was 7:45 exatly lol. So..... as long as they don't see that i was missing, or check there chart for when i was suppose to get off... im good. But fuck i have to go do the exact same thing tonight.... and i donno how im gonna do it... im in so much pain. and since im fat and my legs touch, they are all... raw and red rom all the walking, ugh, i  give myself two more days tops lol."

"event","God i have zero to do. So i will outline my last few days. 

Days befor canada day: Picked up my friend Ashley, we hung out, watched alice in wonderland. Then we walked over and picked up Alanna. We all sat in my basement and talked about nothing, then they talked about cutting and what not. So I just sat there, because unlike 95% of the teen population, I don't cut myself. Then i drove Ashley home, Alanna and i went to timmys, this is now around 2 in the morning. There was a large group of loud breaders there, so we left soon after ariving.

Canada day: Alanna came over around 4ish, we went to her house and watched miss congeniality ... or whatever.. 2... it kindda sucked, don't see it. The we watched ""Jacket"" and not only is the hottest man alive in it,Adrien Brody, but its an amazing movie. Then we walked around viewing other peoples fireworks. Andrew came out with us after and we spent the better part of the a.m trying to get ontop of the schools, all with no such luck. So I stole the ""O"" out of ""Catholic"" and we all went home lol.

Day after canada day: Around ten, went out with alanna again, highlights of the night. Found a bag of sunflower seeds left behind by sexy baseball players, so we ate them. 

Next day: NOTHINGGG

Yesterday: Went to my frined sarahs in the big ol city. Hit on straight guys and went ot subway, this is kind of amusing 

*parents come and pick me up i get in the car* 
Me: Do you have any food in here
DAD: were going to subway right now
ME: I don;t wanna go in i look like crap
DAD: no ones going to even know who u are

so we go into subway, i look lik crap. See people i know. It was only a family member, but shes effing cool all the same lol.

Today: Watching Ghost world and my back hurts like hell. The end."

"event","So I went to ""bicks pickles a.k.a smuckers a.k.a holyfuckweregoingtokillyouifyoudoonethingwrong"" So I get there at like, 8:45 and I'm like, ok where do i goo. So then this other chick is like ""are you here for tyhe orintation?"" and im like ""yea"" and shes like ""good come with me then i donno where to go""

so i donno her name but now were new best frinends. The whole thing was just like 30 people in a room that was extramly cold, but i guess thats better then being super hot. All we did was listen to people talk about what we will do, how you can get fired. They have a zero tolenence thing, they fired 90 people last year ! *gulp*

So it's 9 bucks an hour, and 48 hours a weeek, thats 6 days a week people, and they could call you in for more time but you get paid time and a half for that. But holy, whos not going to have a life this summer 
*points to self*

And like... this is gonna be totally confussing. They will call us and tell us when our first day is and what time. We need to have a bicks t shirt, work boots, pants, no jewlery/nailpolish/percings. Then we go, and we have to find our swipe card in a rack of over a thousand, and it will just be randomly in there, then you swipe in, and look at this paper thing what line you will be on, then since they didnlt tell us wtf the lines are were all gonna be like, hey random man, wtf is this. 

Andddd if you are late, don't have the proper stuff, ""horse-around"", screw something up, FIRED.

And ew, we will eaither be (or most likly be) one of the following three. 
1. Sorter: Basically you look though the cucumbers as they go by for; sticks, rocks, leaves, rotton or mis-shaped cucumbers, or oh yea, DEAD ANIMALS! I.E RACCONS!
2. Topper: You stand there as each jar goes by and yo stick two or three more cucumbers into the tops of each jar
3. Pounder: You stand there with a weird mallot thing and shit the pickles so they are belod the jars seal line so the lid will go on. 

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sounds like fun bitches. I think i will not last all summer. But for over 400 a week, its good.

Oh and theres lots of boys for eye candy, but i have a feeling that after my first raccon sighting or pickle slipping and falling on. I will be to smothered in foul pickle smell and sweat to care."

Rearragne my room so the frame was over here *points the the left of my  room* and my bed part over here *points to the right* will al my dressers moved around and crap. So now it's ""fixed"" a.k.a my dad put a bucket under the frame to hold it up.... cause that plastic will hold better where the metal could not. *head desk x 50* 

I finsihed a book yesterday, finally, I'm on a reading kick again. So I started the third in the trilogy today. I hope its as good as the ""magics pawn"" series. But prob not since that was the bestest book EVER.

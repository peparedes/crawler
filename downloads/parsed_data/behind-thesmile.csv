And i was like ""yeah I need to find myself and I just need time away, I need ot be on my own, well I'll be with Anne but you know what I mean"" He started crying and I felt like I was just i don't know doing something I shouldn't...it hurt, seriously did, because I am so close to him and I'm leaving him you know? Then there was My other friends, who were just surprised and sad, but like I said its a new begginning for me...I wanna know if what I feel for this guy is true, and if it is, then I'm all his! Till then, We will see.

I'll be in Quebec tomorrow night. I'll have access online and access to the phone anytime, so if anyone wants to call me, haha ask and I'll give you the number where I'm staying at.

I'll miss a lot of people here, but atleast I'll have Anne and Joshy pooh in Quebec hehe, you gotta love him like seriously, his g/f is the sweetest to, she called me and anne tonight and was like your rooms are all ready and everything all you have to do now is bring your asses down here and party hahaha.

"event","You know when your so just caught up in the moment and you don't know how deep your getting yourself in? See everyone thinks ""I'm anne the perfect girl"" I'm not I've had a lot of problems before, and still do. I've tried to hide them the best I could, pretend like it never happened...this is probly gonna be the most personal entry ever, because there will be things in here, deepest feelings and secrets... But theres no point in hiding it nomore.

My early years -o to 8- My dad beated my mom everyday, once almost to death, and he'd hurt me also, I'm not over that and never will be because its a part of my childhood that affected my entire life
I'm still not over it, never will be, because every night when I go to bed I remember those nights where I cried myself to sleep begging god to make it stop, and every morning when I'd wake up it would start all over again, I'd go to school, hoping when I'd get home he'd be gone and me and m ymom would be safe again...Sometimes I'm still affraid that when I go home he'll be there beating my mom up...and I'll be screaming ""please stop""...not being able to help her because I'm too afraid to...Those are somethings that u can't erase easily and never will be able to erase them. 

13-16: I made myself throw up cause I thought I was too ugly...I have to thak my step sister for getting me out of thats situation.=)

Than I've had lots to deal with afterwards, my gma being sick, me being sick also, my mom being stressed just everything falling apart in front of me and i cant do anything about it because, im too afraid!

I hate my dad, I've always have and always will, when I have to go see him its like torture, I dont have to really but I feel like im obligated to, like if i dont go he'll beat me up...

My step dad is the best man ever, he treated me and my mom like queens, he showed us what it was to be loved. he showed us the better things in life, and how to appreciate it. To me, he saved me from a nightmare, he came into my life and made it better. I thank him everyday because without him I don't know where we would be. He's always been there and always will, we have our fights but, we always forgive each other. To me he's my Dad, because he earned it...I love him.

My g-ma saved me form my childhood, she would take me to her house, and bake me cookies and read me stories, she'd hold me when I cried and she'd do her best to make me feel good. She'd always tell me "" you might not be in the best situation now, but believe me, good things comes to those who are determined to find happiness, and to those who wait for it with patience, and you my dear, waited and are determined"" She'd always sing me a lullaby, and now everytime i go to the hospital and see her I sing that same lullaby she sang to me. 

Without my Step dad and gma i dont know where I'd be! There my angels...

I went to my first class this morning, they already gave me an essay=p...Thats all for now...I'll write more about my day in another entry!"

Tonight we were talking about pass relationships and all that crap, and well no offence Mike is ur gonna read this but Mike's never had a g/f except for the one he has right now, and he was talking like he had experience in this type of situation and he was trying to gimme advice like c'mon hello???
then this other dude out of nowhere grabbed my ass in the store, I wanted to kick his ass, friggin' jerk!!!

I'm like really sick right now its not even funny, I'm walking around with my box of kleenex and my a bottle of water to keep my throat from being dry. I have like major headaches and I'm over tired! (Shush luc do not comment on how you told me to go to bed early thanks)
Yeah but anyways, I found a puppy hehe well actually I have two choices, either I can probly get one tomorrow, or one this fall, so I'm not too sure yet, I'm gonna go see the one i can have tomorrow and if hes cute enough I'll take it haha. 
I think my cat is getting better? Because he wants to go outside and he hasnt for like almost 2 weeks =o).

Anne is an idiot sometimes, she tried lying to her mom about something lol and she did that weird face she ALWAYS makes when she lies and hermom's like ""do you think im stupid?"" I almost burst out laughing but I held it in! hahahahaa!

I talked to Chris today but not for long. I sent him the pix he wanted he was happy =o).

I went to my dad's to take those pics, and ugh his fiance is soooo annoying she's like ""OMG like imagine we can go shopping together for baby clothes, I'm thinking of calling her Tara or Isabella.."" I'm like how the hell do you know its gonna be a girl you idiot!!! She's not even 3 months pregnant...ugh...I'm hoping its a lil boy...I want a lil brother i already gots a step sister lol.

My step dad is the sweetest, he took care of me this mornin he cook me breakfeast and then when he came home for lunch he made me lunch and gave me my medecine.Than tonight he's like if u need anything just give me a shout! haha 

My mom and I are finally getting along again! Good...hehe probly cause I'm sick and she said ""whenever ur sick you look like my helpless baby gurl to who I have to take care of"" lol...but whatever.

When you let me believe that you'd be incomplete without me by your side, how could I know that you would go, that you would run, baby I thought that you were the one! Whyy, cant I just leave it all behind? A passion so bright that I was blind, then something made me weak, all came in my sleep, baby I'm in so deep and u know I believe...""

awwww...I miss my booooooooooooooooooo!!!  Hopefully I'll get to talk to him tonight..
Well I'm gonna go do my stuff!

"event","Just got back from eatin' at a smanshi fancy restaurant hahaha...It was nice! 
I talked to my Boo...hehe=o) he always makes me smile. My gma called me like 5  mins ago she's like ""don't forget to come and see me tomorrow darlin'"" lol...I love her!
We met Mike and Jen on our way to the restaurant haha their crazy...
Whoooaaaaa, get this...tomorrow I have to go to U of A to get my schedule for school heh...=o)

'Kay well at the restaurant the waiter lol...seemed gay, so I kinda like made fun...and than when I WAS about to tell him bout my single gay friend Jeremy...his g/f walked in...I was like DAMN! hahaa  but whatever he wasnt that good lookin' !!=o) Jerm can do wayyyy better haha! But you know somethin that really like groosess me out is seeing two gay guys or lesbians kissin' in front of me like yuck!!!

Seriously, like the other day I went into WEM and than I saw these two guys kissing and that just grossed me out...I was hungry before I saw them and totally lost my apetite afterwards!

JR asked me these questions earlier, its like a quiz of somesort:

1) If you had the choice between having a relationship with a superstar of your choice but he wouldn't love you, or having a great guy with normal looks who's head over heals for you which one would you pick?

I'd pick the great guy, I'd rather have a relationship based on the right things than some fantasy with no true values...

2)If you could be with anyone anywhere right now, who would it be and where?

Oh god, I have no idea...I'd probly go on some exotic tropical island with my Boo.=o)

3) What exactly do you want to be when your older and why?

Pediatrician all the way, I love kids and I like working with sick children, I went with my aunt to Guatemela once, when I was 14, and I'll always remember those lil kids, we had to take care of them, and  it wasn't like fun but I liked doing that, there was a good feeling to it, knowing I could help out!! 

4) Do you ever want to get married and have children?

Of course, but mariage is a big step in someones life, so I'd make 100% sure it would be for the right reasons and that I truly loved him before giving myself a 100%! Trust is a big issue for me!

5) Who are your best friends in real life and why?

Stephie- Just because I've known her my entire life and I could always count on her!

Mike- He's the brother I've never had!! He's just very special to me. And I'm happy he finally found his princess!

Anne- This gurl is amazing, you can never be bored with her, your either always laughing or have abig smile on your face when your with her she's just that amazing!

Nate- I haven't met her yet, but I will. she's a great friend to me and I consider her a bestie, just cause whenever you need to talk to somebody you know she'll be there!

Christine- She's just my confident and someone I can feel comfortable with in any situation.

Kim- We don't talk as much anymore since school's been over but I've always loved this gurlie!

Brady- He's an online friend, but he's always fun to talk to and I don't know he's just there when I need to talk! We haven't talked in a while though =o)

6) Who can u see yourself at this very moment spending a lot of time with?

My boo...Because Everytime I talk to him, I feel these lil butterflies in my stomach...He has this amazing power over me, he just surprises me a lot...He's just amazing!=o) Wuv you!

7) Finally, would you ever consider having a 3 sum?

Nope, not even if you paid me!!!

Haha...yeah long i know but it ws doing it it unbored me!

Awww I thought those were the sweetest. Anne Called like ten times and I even told her I'd be gone for the week but she still called so many times haha, I called her ba ck im like ""ANNEEEEEEE...I'm back now so u can quit callin' and come over "" haha, it was awesome. I spent sometime reading e-mails gawd so many people e-mailing me when I'm gone...Like HELLO why don't you e-mail me when I am home huh? lol

But whatever I had an awesome time in quebec except for the entire raining thingy ugh! OK

Now heres the entire thingy that was exciting...
We went to this festival okay, and haha Cedric was DRUNK like badly lol so him and his friends, (dumas, JM, Frederick, Dominik) lol were like tellin' me and my cousin Marie-Helene to like drive because they wern't in any position to even take the wheel, so then Marie-Helene was like ok then Cedric (which is her brother) was like don't take the ball on the stearing wheel off, or something like that so I was like why not? than hes like because just don't then were like um ok whatever you know! Then we drive and its like a 2 hour drive from where we stayed at like in my moms lil hometown so we had to drive and there was a big storm...so we couldnt see the road clearly and JM kept on pushing Marie-Helene to go faster and she was like no we'll get into an accident and all that, so then, he like knocked her out and we ALMOST got into an accident but didn't (thank god)...Than we got at Cedrics and hes like ok i have ot go to the store to get more alcohol, so were like no ur going to bed since you got to work in the mornin but than he like tried to kiss me...and hes like my cousin and im like what the fuck get away, then hes like oh sorry im just not myself im like yeah like i didnt know! but yeah THAN in the morning, I went to his appartment to see if he was stilla live because he didnt show up for work but he wasnt there so then I looked all over this lil shitty town for him and found him at Danny's which turns out to be my cousin Melanie's b/f...but yeah they went and played golf...haha but yeah then the last night we were there, we had like a family thingy like the entire 17 bro and sis(my mom with her family) yeah and it was awesome we were like 105 people there haha...it was cool, omg i have like 50 first cousins on my mom's side thats like CRAZY!

But yea I thought my week there would be boring but seriously the only boring part of it was going to the empty cottage at night that was it the rest was exciting, like there wasnt really a dull moment because we were always laughing and my uncle he kept on telling us these jokes haha, yeah then his wife was like telling us a joke about winter, omg i dont think ive ever lauighed so much, i had cramps, because i couldnt stop laughing. 

I might go there this winter to snowboard with my cousins, it'll be awesome. My uncle hes really old and he has a really sweet cottage(his house) but to me  its a sorta cottage thingy but yea he said since his old, if he passes away he's living it to me! I don't want him to die, but its sweet of him to think of me, because that cottage means everything to him and he decided to leave it to me, he says im the closest he's ever had, because he neve rhad kids, and he considers me like his daughter.He's always been my fave uncle just cause we always had fun! 

Some of you might think this entry is boring haha i know! Sorry I just had to write about it because I think my week there was the best week ive ever had because it didnt only made me happy but it made me and my mom happy and we got closer, and we needed to like think about other things then fighting and that was the perfect vacation i wouldnt change anything about it.....EXCEPT the entire rain scenario!

Well yeah haha...

But yeah we come back and ate supper with the entire FAM! and yeah this other cousin of mine which i've never seen because reminder its been over 10 years or something like thta since Ive came here but yeah anyways, this other cousin he has a huge crush on me lol and then Cedric's like this is your cousin from Edmonton but he only quit for like that day then today when I went to see them he was all over me again and hes like well were only like second cousin im like yeah well to me it doesnt matter right?

"event","I cried all day today & I'm still crying now. I put my dog to sleep this mornin', I never thought It'd be this hard but its worse, I cried at work, and they told me to go home, so I did, came here and everythin' I looked at reminded me of my dog. Then I saw pictures which made it worse. When I brought it to the vet he looked at me and it was in the way like he was tellin' me ""Are you leavin' me alone?"" I wanted to stay and hold his paw but the vet told me it wasn't a good idea...When we went back to get him, toi barry it, I couldn't stop cryin', I'm still cryin' right now. I miss him, Now I won't have someone scratchin' on my door wanting to come in, follow me everywhere, and look at me with those puppy eyes when I eat! I thought it was replacable, because all my other dogs were, but this one is dofferent, i got so attached to him, and lettin' go is too hard...
I can't believe I'm cryin' and bein' sad over a dog, but I am, he meant a lot! Everynight when I came home I knew someone was waitin' for me or was gonna come runnin' at the door to see me, now I know I won't! I took care of him for 2 weeks when he was sick, I'd hold im and sing to him so he'd fall asleep...I'd give him all my pillows and carry him everywhere, because he could barely walk...Its so hard, my step dad was like we'll get a new one, but he won't be the same as my old one, because my old one was and will always be my one and only...I put a rose with him when we barried it...and before the vet took him away i kissed him on the top of the head and told him i loved him...this is pathetic to you guys probly, but to me, he was more then a dog, he was my best friend!
Imagine, I'm cryin' so much for a dog, I don't wanna even think about how I'll cry when my g-ma or any other close member of my family dies...I hate how I'm feelin' right now...it sux...but this song I'm listennin' to is how I feel...
My friend drove 8 hours to see me this week, because we hadn't seen each other in over a year, it was nice...she left though, but shes comin' back on the 15 th...I can't write anymore...I'm too sad :(

I didn't fight with my dad today. He introduced me to his girl and ya we had a lil chit chat it wasn't ""Bombastic"" but whatever atleast we didn't fight. I saw my gurlies this mornin' also heh, Emilia left her boo YAY finally! haha We promised to go out sometime and just have fun between us girlies! hehe, and besides he treated her like shit, you wanna know the funny part? He actually went to Anne's house because Emilia lives 1 hour from Edmonton, so she has 2 spend the week there for school but yeah he actually drove to anne's and cried to get Emilia back, and then he tried to kiss her but she was like ""NAH UH never again, been there done that!"" You go girl heh! =o) I'm sorry if this is rude BUT she deserves better then a bum who has no goals in life except makin' his gurl work to bring all the money in! Can anyone say PATHETIC![lol]
Anywho, I was supose to go to the studio and sing but I didn't feel up to it. Saw my EX today also, heh, We hung out a bit, a few minutes nothin' much! He's beginning to be nice but it's too late now!
""I was such a fool I couldn't see it, what you meant to me, you told me you loved me and I said I needed to be free"" Thats what he told me, I'm like well you only got yourself to blame, you brought it on yourself so whatever its over and I've never been happier!=o) I'm glad he said it was a mistake cheatin' on me though, it made me feel a bit better because I just thought to myself jeeezzz I just wasn't enough or somethin'. But he said I was more then enough that he was just ebin' dumb! It was nice to know! I told him we could like talk once in a while but to not expect us gettin' back together 'cause in my book its just done and over with, you know like, I'm tired of bein' used and lied to, I deserve better and I'll get better! If I keep tellin' myself that everything will work out and I'll be happy one day not that I'm not right now, just happy in love.=o) that special feelin' you get when you can't get enough on that other special someone, the butterflies and the emotions, just explodin' inside of you, waitin' for the perfect moment to let it all out, sharing your love and spendin' long nites staring in each others eyes, havin' his arms wrapped around you, and feelin' like nothing in the world can possibly hurt you right now, because you ARE protected! Thats what I do wanna have, and I will have it because I'm determined to. I'm not gonna spend my life alone! I refuse to!

"event","This entry will probly be the most personal one I'll ever write...
I hate having to wake up in the morning remembering what I went through, everything thats happened in the past. Mostly my childhood, hiding in my room wishing I was somebody else. Hearing my parents fight, seeing what I had to see. Being afraid to say anything...Having ot deal with is for a very long time and still it hunts me... I've been pretty good at hiding it, trying to be strong, because thats how I was brought up to be. When my parents got divorced I was happy, I felt like celebrating, and I don't even regret that feeling. Years went by and I thought everything was gonna be fine, my mom is with an awesome guy who treats her like a queen, and that is what she is! Not having to deal with my dad, because he's never around, which im happy about. I've never had a close relationship with him, never will, he ruined it for me and him.. He just showed me how he could really be and that just showed me, that any women who let themselves be beaten and treated the way my mom got treated, need to stand up for themselves! 
Now another thing thats been bothering me...
I can't seem to trust anybody and I hate havin' to feel that way. I hate having to cry at night because I'm tire dof everything and I'm tired of always being the one helping out people and never gettin' anything in return. 
When I broke up with my 3 year b/f, nobody was there except for Steph, all of my other friends who I was ALWAYS there for whenever they needed me, never called or came over to cheer me up, only steph did, thats when I realised she was my true friend. 

It was hard gettin' over everything, memories, the laughs and even the cries! I miss havin' a b/f and I miss feelin' so in love.
I miss bein' able to say I love you, and I miss everything that a relationship gives. I miss those late night phone calls and I miss being held... 

I'm not saying I hate bein' single, there are some upsides to it, but it'll never beat the feeling you get when you know you got someone lovin' you. 

I know I got someone out there and one day it'll come, but its hard...

The only guy I've gotten pretty close to emotionally after my break up lives so far away...it's even hard sometimes talkin' to him knowin' I can't even be with him, right there! Although I do like him a lot..

Friendships, I have but I only got a few golden ones! =os...

Sometimes I feel like my world is falling apart in front of me and I can't do anythin' to stop it...

I just need to know I'll be okay and I don't have to worry all the time...I don't know maybe I'm just not used to this whole single thing? But than again, maybe I'm just afraid not to have anybody who truly cares about me?

Looks don't give you everythin'..."

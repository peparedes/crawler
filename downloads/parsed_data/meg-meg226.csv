there's nothing like chasing your dog,hysterically crying over a boy, through a dimly lit construction site and hospital parking lot. then as you are halfway home, after having chased him for 1/2 an hour, the string you used to catch him snaps in half and the cycle starts all over again.
why does a he have to make me feel like i dont matter to him and that she is more important to his life at any given moment.

i swear exgirlfriends were put here to ruin my life.

Thank you SCOTT JORDAN SILVER my true best friend. you are always there for me, no matter what and i am eternally grateful. and you handled a crying girl rahter well! lol

ok well im off to depress myself even more and watch alfie

i have a ponderance for you all. its about love and being in it. how do you know if you love someone? and is it really love? at such a young age, how do you even know? do you think there is a difference in loving someone and being in love with them? how so? what feeling do you get? do we ever truly love anyone besides ourselves?
comment with your thoughts, it would be greatly appreciated!!

its been a reeeeaaaaaaaallllllllyyyy long time. this summer has been a blast! probably the best summer of my life. bac was well... interesting to say the least. but summer wouldnt have been the same without it. i miss it sooo much. especially the campers.( like sam and jared and cory and erica- best campers) its make me really sad to think that i dont know if i will be returning to it next summer and im so uncertain of it and it depresses me. i miss everyone so much already and i still see most of them. the counselours were the BEST this year. i miss everyone of them( even though i see some of the mall the time- like jimbo)

Friday was much fun
much needed venting and discussing with miss. michelle  
as we've said before- we NEED to hang out more! 
we went to dinner and a movie- fun times!

Saturday i went to cheeburger- Scott and Lyle ate the pounders and got their pictues taken. that gigantic cheeburger is crappy looking- i expected better. then we went back to Scott's and just chilled.
 
And today i did nothing but watch the usual suspects- sooo good

so people are still pissing me off but there's not much i can do about it. People need to realize that you can't be friends with someone and hang out wtih them only when its convenient for you! (you know who yuou are.- or maybe you dont and thats the problem)

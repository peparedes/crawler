"event","Things have been on hiatus for years, but as a ""taking time for myself"" measure, I did some cleaning here and I may be back. I spent so many years on LJ, that even though there appear to have been significant changes in the 2+ years I was away, this is where my first real internet home was.  I've largely moved to Rav, and I dabbled other places, but this place is where it all began. (And continued for many years and in many places... At som point I should to figure out what all my alternate journals for various purposes were.)

Everything in the past is private-locked now - so even if you are someone I once knew, and in some bizarre turn of events, we become friends again, that stuff is in the past. Too much in there to delete forever, but not relevant to anyone but me at this point. 

Plus, I like the way LJ comms function, compared to say, Tumblr, and there's at least a few comms I'd like to follow.

So I'm not sure that I'm going to be doing public or private posts. This, for now, will be public, in case any once-friends realize I exist, since I turned off my old friends-only post, and for anyone else who may come looking.

PS - I'm not completely devoid of angst, but I'm not a screaming mess like I used to be."

Get in touch if you want to be added here.
I make no guarantees, I've learned to be distrustful as a default.

"event","I apologize to those of you who read my lj for having gone AWOL again so quickly, but I've been sicklyviolet for much of the past two weeks. I started having symptoms on the night of Sunday, June 14th and didn't recover till the following Sunday afternoon (June 21st). My sickest two days were Tuesday, June 16th and Wednesday, June 17th--both of which were of the, ""Oh, Gods! Can't I just *die*?"" variety. I'm not sure what ailed me, but it combined features of my allergies and asthma, arthritis, and diabetes-related GI complaints all topped off with extreme fatigue. I'm okay now but way behind on the Summer III semester, which began on Monday, June 8th. So...I'm back but you probably won't see me a lot for a week or two more. Those of you who replied to my posting about asking for an online practicum: Thanks a million! (Especially you, Wooly! Your points were well-taken and will go into any request for a practicum via Distance Learning.

I'm off to read a few of you guys posts.

I hope each of you is happy, well, and enjoying Summer!

P.S. Ifinally watched _Slumdog Millionaire_ with Harry Sunday night and enjoyed it very much, its flaws not withstanding. I look forward to reading the book it was taken from! - V."

"event","<sigh> I dunno why, but the longer I go without posting, the harder it always is to resume. These past few weeks I've been giving myself a break during the break between my semesters. (Summer 2009 semesters began yesterday, so I'm back in harness. I'm not an instructor of record this time, but I'm Dr. AnaLouise Keating's GA for two courses, and as a student I'm taking Career Counseling--which I dropped last Fall--and an introductory course in HTML, XHTML, and CSS through library Science. The latter is admittedly an odd course choice for me, but there weren't that many 100% online graduate courses available this Summer!)

I've been okay. In some ways, I've been *better* than okay. I just took the three or four weeks off because I wanted some time for myself. This actually my secondary journal, which I maintain to keep some of you up on what I'm doing. My main journal is a paper and pen jobber I write a three-page entry in every day as part of a magickal practice I'm pursuing. I started it on January 12th, so it will be half a year old a week from Friday. I keep a magickal journal--i.e., a description of the practices I'm engaged in, too, and later this month I'll start keeping a dream journal, so I think most of you can see why sometimes I need a break from lj this year!

A friend (the aforementioned AnaLouise Keating) asked me a very good question yesterday--for which I have answers, but not necessarily very good ones. She wanted wanted to know, ""Why can't you do your practica in Family Therapy by phone or online?"" Now that's a valid question because there are some psychotherapists who work by phone and/or online. It would be hard to arrange, but I'm not sure it would be *impossible* to arrange, so (as they used to say on _I Love Lucy_) I've got some thin'in' to do! The predictable objections would be: (1) You can't get a qualified supervisor, because no one has experience with that! It might be a royal bytche and pretty expensive to find a qualified supervisor, but I'm not sure it couldn't be done. (2) It won't allow you to empathize with/for your clients adequately. I'm not so sure. I feel with/for a lot of peeps I only communicate with online, including you guys and my students. When I worked for the answering service, I empathized with many doctors, nurses, and patients that I only knew as voices on my phone lines. Hell, it's been demonstrated in a study I ready a few years back that the same neural circuitry lights up when we empathize with characters in books as when we empathize with living, breathing humans sitting in front of us. 'Sides, narrative therapy is primarily a cognitive model. It doesn't deal so much with hands-on experience with clients' feelings as with interacting with how they *think* about various things in their lives. (3) Then there's the issue of confidentiality. Can we keep therapy confidential if it's carried out by phone or online? I'm sure that doing so would be challenging, but so's confidentiality in face-to-face environments. Therapists' office have been bugged, and their files--whether stored in file cabinets or in data files have been stolen. I would need to research how confidentiality is preserved in telephony and online. Do I wanna explore these options for doing therapy? I'm not sure. But nobody's moving on getting me inpatient physical therapy. And I'm not getting any younger. And I can't keep running up student loan debt forever. So... If any of you have any opinions regarding any of the issues raised in this paragraph of today's posting, I really, *really* want to hear from you--here or via email. Lupa, I would especially value your input as a fellow therapist-in-training. Wooly, Mama Bear, and Pat Gund, I will really like to hear from you as peeps familiar with online security issues. But the rest of your opinions count, too. I will probably have to fight my faculty if I go this route, although I think I can line up some allies. I don't want to go into the fray with my troops untrained and in disorder!

Moving from important stuff to more everyday fare, while I was gone I watched the entire first season of _TrueBlood_. Yum! Now *that's* show possesses some classic HBO tasty goodness! Also on the supernatural chick lit front, I really enjoyed Anita Blake #17. It reminded me a great deal of _Obsidian Butterfly_, which squicky as it is is one of my all-time AB favorites. 90% less rising of the ardeur (and when it *does* rise it mostly serves purposes other than porn-lite titillation of the reader). Lozza entertaining ag with LVPD. A vampire serial killer. Everyone's favorite human serial killer in the Anita-verse (Olaf). What a fun ride! BTW, anyone who's read it care to hazard a guess when AB will finally realize that she doesn *need* big, strong men to protect her from Olaf--or even her knives and guns? The Gods alone know what she'll do if she ever *does* figure that out! (Hopefully, *not* decide she's beyond all salvation herself!) I finally got to see the 2008 _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ out in the living room with Harry yesterday. I liked it! I know the critics weren't enchante, but it worked for me. I think my next trip to the front room will be to watch _Slumdog Millionaire_. 

On that note, adieu! It's 10:15 already and I've got other stuff to do before noon.

Have a great day!

"event","Today is one of my four 20th anniversaries--from my point, the best of them. My husband & I got together as a couple following a Beltane ritual I conducted 21 years ago last night, so in the sense of ""How long have you been together?"" my 20th anniversary was *last* Beltane. However, we weren't handfasted (joined in the eyes of our religious community) until the following Beltane, so in that sense (which is the most meaningful sense to me), we've been together for 20 years last night/today. The following year we re-affirmed our vows on Beltane (third anniversary) and filed an informal declaration of marriage with the state of Texas on June 3rd (fourth and legally binding but least satisfying ritual). So happy anniversary to Harry & me! I didn't see it coming and I didn't expect it to last, but it did and it has so YAY!!! (BTW, we're having take-out from our favorite swanky restaurant tonight to celebrate and plan to express particular gratitude in our slightly belated Beltane ritual tomorrow.)

H1N1 (formerly ""the swine"") flu has very likely made it to Denton now. We have six probable cases. I'm betting good money at least some of them are at the town's two universities (TWU and the University of North Texas). Since H1N1 has been mild for the most part, I'm not too worried. However, my respiratory system is compromised by asthma so you might want to think healthy thoughts for me. As a housebound per, I don't get out a lot but my husband teaches classes on a campus with 12,000+ students three days a week so he could certainly ""bring a little something home."" Hopefully by Fall, I can get vaccinated against H1N1 as well as seasonal flu. (Pandemic and even epidemic flus have a history of coming back in a nastier form the during the following flue season.)

Apart from Beltane and our anniversary, Harry & I have a busy weekend on tap. He has a term paper he needs to write for his Feminist Rhetoric class, which is due on Wednesday, and I have my webliography to write for Electronic Information Retrieval, which is due a week from today. (For all practical purposes, I need to write it ASAP, though, because I have a final exam to compose next week.) Don't count on hearing from me again this weekend. I almost certainly won't have time to post, although I *might* get to read and comment on some of your postings.

In my copious spare time <wink, wink, nudge, nudge> I'm reading the Mercy Thompson books, which my non-lj friend AnaLouise got me hooked on. I *like*! The character development in the books is really wonderful, although the plots come crashing to a conclusion a bit gracelessly occasionally, IMO. I noticed the author (Patricia Briggs) has another series out called ""Alpha & Omega."" can any of you give me a rec on it? Next week Sookie Stackhouse #9 should arrive--just in time to help me recover from the last week of instruction for this semester. Oh, and Penczak's final volume of the ""Temple of Witchcraft"" series will grace my doorstep, too. (The new MLA manual will be out as well, but somehow I can't work up as much active enthusiasm over it!)

I think that's all for the mo. I hope that each of you has an outstanding weekend, really and truly!

It's good for drinking lots of hot tea. Good for reading. Good for relaxing. What's not to like? (Rhetorical question, Angelique. You've got your very own lj for posting snarky remarks about weather that isn't hot and dry. Don't rain on my thundershowers and I won't blister your warm, dry, sunny days. Pax?) 

I'm just passing through. Harry should be getting in from teaching Comp any minute and then we'll have lunch (a ham and veggie dish over whole-wheat angel hair). 

My blood sugar was low for the second day in a row, so I went along with Harry's hankering for a donut run this morning. I had a sausage mini croissant, a plain cake donut (with neither frosting nor sugar), and an especially nice mini apple fritter. Since I don't get to do that often, it was a helluva lot of fun to do it today!

I hope everyone's week is off to a good start. As you can tell, I'm happy with mine.

"event","Well, it occurs to me that if I want to post this week, which I do, there's no time like the present. By tomorrow I'll be up to my eyebrows in writing a webliography as the capstone project for Nancy Gotcher's class and in helping Harry track down plagiarism in his students' papers. Also, the Denton Jazz Festival will be in full swing just across the street from where I live and with attendees swarming across our courtyard from around 9:00am till nearly midnight. Ugh! Don't get me wrong, the part of me capable of enjoying music, which is relatively small for a 21st-century American, likes the Jazz Festival very much. If I were currently mobile, I would attend at least one major artist's concert. However, the venue's gotten too big and raucous to hold in a residential neighborhood, IMO. I wish they could find a larger, more insulated site for it--devoutly!

I've been steadily busy with the usual schoolwork all week, but there weren't any major projects for me to complete as a graduate student or to grade as an instructor. Harry, on the other hand, has been buried alive in ""instructor-review drafts"" of his students' research papers all weekend. Fun! (*Not!*) His students' lack of a good grasp on their native language in its written form is just about to drive him bug shit. Poor man! (I can afford to empathize because I'll be buried in short reports on a learning activity called ""Give Me That Old-Time Television Religion"" this time next week. Trust me: Those papers will bring out the Snape-as-Pedagogue in me. I tremble.)

Speaking of Snape, it won't be long now until Warner Brothers finally coughs up _Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince_. For Harry's (my husband, not Potter) sake and for the sake of all my friends who are Potter fans I'm delighted. However, the prospect of being homebound when it's released does *not* make my day. Harry & I have done the opening-night midnight Potter run for all five of the previous films, and--damn it to fucking hell!--I want to do the Potter run again this time, too. But...the odds are against me. I'm not sure when/if Dr. Estorque will get me into inpatient rehab for my knee, but things aren't looking good for next month or even this Summer at all. Fuck! I don't want my education/career/life to go down the tubes because I can't get PT. The thought that any of those things *might* get shitcanned (1) pisses me off royally, (2) terrifies me within an inch of my life, and (3) makes me want to go absolutely postal. (In reality, I'm more apt to go whiny and/or have an episode of major depression but what I really *want* to do is just get back in circulation, finish my degree, and work for the few more years I'll live. Why does that have to be such a struggle?)

Well, that wasn't very pleasant! Sorry. I only meant to say that I want to see the flamin' movie as soon as it's released. I'll rein myself in now...

I just finished reading the first two Mercy Thompson novels, which AnaLouise had loaned me. I enjoyed them a lot--especially _Blood Bound_--so I think I'll pick up the rest of the series. Currently, I'm revisiting Isaac Bonewits' _Real Magic_. I still enjoy it but time and a graduate education (and having read later books by Bonewits) have taken some of the bloom off that particular rose. I think I'll always love it that he scored the University of California system's only BA in Magic on Ronald Reagan's watch as a regent, though. How fey is that?

I also received a new CD I really liked this weekend--""Poseidon and the Bitter Bug"" by the Indigo Girls. It's a double album, with the second CD filled up with an acoustic version of the songs. Since I'm a big fan of both the Indigo Girls *and* acoustic guitar, listening to it for the first time yesterday was a really treat for me. (We popped it in during breakfast, because our local NPR station was in the throes of what *feels* like the zillionth day of its Spring pledge drive.) I think my favorite cut is ""Sugar Tongue""--and, no, it is *not* a lesbian love song. Nonetheless, I think it's ""wicked"" in the very best sense!

I think I'll exit this posting while I'm in a good mood. For the same reason, I'm not going to proofread it. I apologize for the Toxic Thoughts Dump, but it really wasn't planned and it seems to have helped.

Have a great weekend!

I'll try to come back and read some of your postings, but no promises. It's flat going to be busy!

"event","I meant to post last week. I really did. I also really meant to read at least some of your postings. But no. Academic life was Being That Way, in spades. By the time I got both my instructor's work for the week done (on Saturday, April 11th) and my graduate student's work done (on Easter Sunday, shortly before midnight) my week was...gone, baby, gone! Monday, April 13th and Tuesday, April 14th just revved up this week's rat race in Whackademia. <very hard, very loud headdesk> I just *love* the run up to semester's end. (Not so much!) Well, that's all water under the bridge now! At least I have a few free minutes this morning before Harry gets home from teaching, we have lunch, and I start my *next* round of Fulfilling My Responsibilities.

I had another outing on Monday. I had an appointment with Dr. Estorque to get lab work done, visit with the doctor, and (I thought) have an EKG and physical done. As things turned out, I wasn't scheduled for an EKG or physical and the lab work was supposed to be done at a local lab *after* my appointment with him. He--and I--did need to discuss this and that, and his LVN took my vital signs, etc., and he checked respiratory sounds, bowel sounds, ENT and so on. He was somewhat unhappy I hadn't seen the wound specialist yet for evaluation of the diabetic neuropathy on my left shin, but we agreed that could wait till between semesters because I didn't have the time or the transportation to get to the doctor's office who he wants me to see. I let him know that A-Friendly Home Healthcare is no longer seeing me because Blue Cross/Blue Shield won't pay them what they think they're entitled to. (His office will try to find a home healthcare agency that *will*.) Still no progress on whether or not to send me to inpatient rehab for physical therapy. (He thinks I need the wound management referral done *before* he makes the referral to the doc who can support sending me for inpatient PT.) Arrggghhhh!!!!! I wish all this wasn't so damned like pulling teeth (without anesthesia/analgesia... I wasn't able to make it to the lab on Monday, because we were late leaving Dr. Estorque's office. (He was late seeing us because he'd been shepherding a patient through an ER admit to Presby when we arrived.) Ed had already missed closed to a half day's work providing our transportation, and he couldn't afford to miss the other half. So... Harry needs to get Choice Medical to install a seatbelt on my wheelchair so we can ride Access (the local paratransit service) to the lab. I *think* we can make that happen by early next week. <groan> At times I (not seriously) wish I could just fall on my sword--and I *do* own one--just to simplify my life!

The outing *as* outing was very nice. I got to see the new, green grass of April in our courtyard and the young, green leaves on the trees and the birds (mostly sparrows) that we hear every morning, and both overcast and, later in the morning, sunny sky. I got to smell it all, too. I'd actually forgotten how good moisture-saturated air and new vegetation can smell. All of that, ensemble, was indescribably delicious! (If you think it couldn't possibly have been *that* great, try staying indoors for weeks and months at a time. Trust me. It can be *exactly* that great!)

Harry found out last Friday that he can take his comps (comprehensive exams) in November, although I think he plans to wait and take them in April 2010 instead. He also learned he only needs to take four more course (one in linguistics, two in literature, and one in literary criticism) to complete his coursework. Once those courses and his comps are out of the way, he can begin writing his dissertation. At this rate, he'll get his doctorate before I complete my second master's degree--but I'm very happy for him!

I managed to read _Turncoat_ just before my life turned off insanely busy. Good book! I really enjoyed (almost) every page of it. Butcher got a bit long-winded in describing Dresden's encounter with the Skinwalker at the Raith's mansion and the climactic battle on the the uncharted island in the lake IMO, but otherwise it was just about a perfect way to spend an afternoon and an evening.

Gotta scoot. Harry's key will hit the lock to the front door any second. Sorry, but this posting will be unproofread. Caveat lector.

I love you all and hope to resume reading your postings by Friday.

Have a great day!

"event","Another week is almost over. Arrggghhhh!!!!! Who the hell put my life on fast forward? Oh! Wait, wait. It's just another semester drawing to a close. That's *not* a cloud of tachyons headed straight at me.

It hasn't been a *bad* week. It hasn't been a great week, either. It's been one of those frustratingly typical, mixed-bag weeks. And now it's nearly done.

The best thing that happened this week was that I learned I made 30 out of 30 possible points on the Electronic Information Retrieval assignment I turned in right before Spring break. (Since my instructor doesn't pass out perfect scores like free samples in a supermarket on Saturday, I'm rather pleased with my 30.) The assignment in question was to write an analysis of one of the databases to which our university library subscribes, using a set of questions she provided. The db I chose was EBSCO Host's Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection, which over the years I've been working on my family therapy degree I've come to know and love *better* than PsycINFO. (It has more articles available as PDF files. It also has more articles from smaller, non-APA but nonetheless academically respectable journals. Color me ""on board""!)

The worst thing that's happened this week is that I've lost my home healthcare--my visits from nurses and, more importantly, physical therapists. Dr. Estorque approved me for more visits, but the agency that was providing them and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Texas butted heads over how much reimbursement my HMO was going to provide. The home healthcare lost. And then *I* lost. I can write about it more or less rationally now, but this time yesterday morning (when I first learned my home healthcare was ""no longer able to provide the services you need"") I was just short of in tears. Harry helped me avoid a quick trip to an episode of Major Depression, for which--yet again--I nominate him for Husband (or Other Partner) of the Year. A week from this coming Monday (April 13th), I have my next appointment with Dr. Estorque. Our current strategy is to see what alternatives he can offer then. (A recurring problem we're running into is that most home healthcare providers only want to work with Medicare/Medicaid, and I have neither Medicare nor Medicaid coverage.) I don't yet know how this is going to impact my overall goal of getting physically rehabilitated. It takes a screwing of Ye Olde Courage to Ye Sticking Pointe to be sure I *want* to know! But when I do know, I'll let you guys know. I'm pursuing both mundane and magickal means to get what I need, but those of you who are inclined to magick are cordially invited to put in your metaphysical tuppence. (Spells, candles, affirmations, etc., would be appreciated, and I cheerfully reciprocate any magickal assistance I receive.) Those of you who aren't magickally inclined, just wish me well--'kay?

I'm currently re-reading _The Tao of Physics_, 4th edition, which I last read around five years ago. This is, I believe, my fifth reading. What's funny is, every time I've read it I've liked it a little better. (I suspect that's a function of each time I've read it, I've been a little better educated!) I'm anxiously awaiting my copy of the new novel of the Dresden files, which hopefully will arrive today or tomorrow. (C'mon, Amazon!) I have two books on standby on my nightstand itself--_The Psychology of Environmental Problems_ (which Lupa recced) and the biography of Paschal Beverly Randolph (which Amazon recced). I look forward to them both, but Lupa's rec is apt to get first read because she requested my opinion of it. (All bets are off if _Turncoat_ *does* show up, though. I'll be hibernating till it's read!) Of course, away from the nightstand itself, there's plenty of stuff laying around the apartment that I can read, or re-read. I am the Info Maniac, after all--*and* married to a PhD student!

Speaking of reading, AnaLouise has added eight new titles to her required and/or recommended reading list for Transgressive Identities since I assisted her last (which was just last summer). Gail (our program secretary) has ordered them, but they haven't begun to arrive yet. Once they do, I predict a bizzy, dizzy readathon for Vi during the May Mini-mester. (Fortunately, I neither take nor teach anything during May Madness!) Don't get me wrong. I am *not* kvetching. I *love* the books AnaLouise uses in that course! (But I will be terminally busy. Anybody know if a whackademic has ever OD-ed on books? I would hate to be the first! };->

I think that's all the news that's fit--or, at least, all the news I care to keyboard at one sitting! I'll try to read, and sometimes comment on, your postings over the weekend; however, I probably won't post again m'self.

"event","Those of you who've known me for awhile know that my husband & I live in a somewhat elderly apartment intermittently plagued with flooding events. Guess what we were dealing with from 1:00-3:00am last night and have continued having to deal with today. (Actually, Harry's had to do most of the dealing. I've provided moral support, an email to his students letting them know he'd canceled their classes this morning, the occasional phone call, and a few exchanges with the maintenance man.) If you guessed we got flooded again, good on you! You've been paying attention. If not, you might not want to let me know. I don't *really* want to defriend you!

The source of the flooding this time was a four-foot length of waste-water pipe, leading from our upstairs neighbors' bathtub to Denton Waste Water by way of a closet wall. The maintenance man speculates, because of the nature of the split that it resulted from a lightning strike. (We've been having thunder showers and thunder storms on and off since Monday.) The inconvenience has been considerable; the damage, mercifully has not. We had to throw out some old papers (from our undergrad days), some undisplayed artwork (all commercially available posters), and a few books we'd tried unsuccessfully to sell to Recycled Books (Half-Price's local competitor), and Harry has some unexpected laundry to do tonight (mostly altar cloths from the closet and towels from the cleanup). Could have been worse. *Much* worse. The closet containing the split pipe is in the bedroom we use as a temple and library. <Vi shudders> Thank the Gods that nothing we *use* took a bath in the neighbor's bathwater, plus mold. 

Wish my sinuses luck, though! Between soaked carpets and the disinfectant the maintenance man sprayed, they want to run away to the nearest desert. I'm currently taking antibiotics (for the infection in the spot of diabetic neuropathy on my left shin), so I won't get a bacterial sinus infection. However, I already have immense swelling of my sinuses going, complete with runny nose, and the runny nose has me wheezing with asthma. That's *why* we don't want to save the wetlands the bedroom carpet has become. Think dry thoughts, and especially dry thoughts lacking in mold and mildew. Vi will thank you and Vi's & Harry's books will thank you!

This has been a medical-free week. I can't say I've minded. My physical therapy prescription has apparently been re-upped by Dr. Estorque, but the new therapist Kristi assigned hasn't called me yet. (I'll check in with Kristi tomorrow if I haven't heard from her by then.) A nurse hasn't come to re-certify me for nurse's visits yet, but I'm not too worried about it because Juanita (my nurse) told me the woman at their agency who sets up re-cert visits is on vacation this week. (I'll call Juanita Tuesday, if I haven't heard from a nurse re: re-certification. I frequently feel overmedicalized anyhow (I'm not a great patient), so I'll just smile sweetly and enjoy my break.

You probably won't hear from me again this weekend, because I have a small Electronic Information Retrieval assignment due on Sunday and a large one due on Monday. (BTW, I just found out from Nancy a few minutes ago that I made a perfect score on the *previous* honkin' big assignment for the course. (The one that was due the night before Midsemester Exam week started.) Hooray for perfect scores, eh?

On that note, I'd better close. Harry will be back from Krogers soon, and I have one more task I'd like to complete before he gets home.

I hope each and every one of you has a fabulous weekend. Have some wild & crazy fun for me, that I can't go have for myself at present!

I've been doing more reading for my writing project. This time, in _Interventions with Families of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender People from the Inside Out_. (And, yes, that book is every bit as academic as it sounds! It's actually two issues of _Journal of GLBT Family Studies_ bound together as a trade paperback.) We've established that its contents are somewhat dry and academic. They're also well written and (for me!) very interesting.

Boy, oh boy! Have I got Spring fever. It's even hard to sit here and concentrate on writing a journal entry. I need to, though. I don't come here to post nearly often enough. My mind keeps jumping from this to lunch, though. Or back to the book. Or to getting out in the pretty day (which unfortunately won't happen). Or...or...or...

"event","Well, this is an amazing week. After six months in the Great Indoors, I ventured forth to Dr. Estorque's office to begin my relationship with my new primary care physician. Gail from the Women's Studies program and her husband Ed took me forth in Ed's big ol' tool truck with a hydraulic lift that can heft a hefty woman & her wheelchair to see my doctor. The office visit went well. Doctor's nurse took my hemoglobin A1C, which at 6.1 had my doctor beaming & pronouncing,""Perfect!"" He indicated that, pending my return visit in mid-April for a physical, routine lab work, and a routine EKG, he'll continue me on the medications Dr. Anbarasu had prescribed (and Dr. Asamoa, before her) because their appropriate for my various medical conditions. He wrote a referral to a wound specialist he would like to examine the diabetic neuropathy on my left shin. (It's not all nasty & oozy, but he's a bit concerned about it, as have been my home healthcare nurses.) Later he wants to refer me to a physiorehab doctor to see if there's adequate support for Kristi & Mara's recommendation that I do a stint at an inpatient rehab (a.k.a. ""spa,"" Mama Bear). He also wants to see if he can prescribe a scooter for me successful in lieu of my manual wheelchair. (He thinks it's medically justifiable, but they're hell to get insurance to sign off on currently because so many doctors have written fraudulent scrips for them in recent years.) His stated philosophy is,""We're not just concerned with how well you're functioning today. We want you to be doing well in five, ten years."" (Show of hands: Can anyone in the room support *that*?) So...we'll see. But at least he's not starting off badly. (BTW, his office is fully accessible, open, cheerful, and bright (from a combination of artificial lighting and sunlight). His nurses and techs are smiling and friendly, too. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but the vibes are good.

"event","As most of you know, I think the physical therapist Mara, who I've been working with since late December, is the in the ""best thing since sliced bread"" category. (Hey, that's the name of the category. I personally think she's the best thing since chunks of homemade bread fresh from the oven, slathered with real butter and all-natural preserves.) Some of you also know that my time to work with her was coming to an end because she's going to work for a new agency at the beginning of April. Well, as things worked out today was our last session together. I have my re-cert with her supervisor Kristi this weekend and, if (very likely) I'm retained as a patient, I'll start working with a new therapist the following week. We went out on a roll. I stood for 30 seconds for the first time today. For those of you who've never done a course of PT, that's an important milestone, because 30 seconds is the length of time muscles have to hold a position to form a memory of doing so. In a way, everything we'd done so far was the prelude to having a moment like that that my body can actually remember. So three cheers for Mara & Vi. We did good. We did *real* good! No matter how good my new therapist is, I'll miss Mara. She's not only an excellent therapist but also a remarkable woman. As we were parting, we promised her that if I get to go to the ""spa"" (as Mama Bear styles it) and their work with me is successful, we'll take her out to lunch or dinner as one of my first non-medical trips on my return to the Great, Wide World. BTW, I told her about get hysterical at the thought of doing rehab on Saturday night. She wasn't disappointed with me at all. Her first words were, ""Well, it is a big, scary deal!"" Do I need to tell any of you how great that made me feel? (In my profession-to-be, we call that ""normalizing""--reminding people that it's not abnormal to respond to out-of-the-ordinary situations in extreme ways.) We talked about what neuromuscular/orthopedic inpatient rehab units are like and now it seems a little less scary, although she didn't sugarcoat the experience and it certaily seems scary enough! I'm gonna miss that woman. Majorly.

That's all for now. I just wanted to share this morning's experience with you.

"event","[Warning! Negative thinking ahead. You might not want to read this posting. It went sour on me when I didn't expect it to.]

What a week! The last one before Spring break. I literally worked myself sick. By Wednesday, my left leg was huge to the knee with edema and its knee and hip joints hurt like hell, I had water blisters coming up on my right shin from edema, and I was walk-into-walls, burnt-toast tired. Thursday something had to give, so I slept most of the day away--emerging only to eat, excrete, mutter semi-coherent responses to my husband, and (in my best moments) read a few pages of Betty Berzon's _Permanent Partners_. I also knew I had a sinus infection from the blood that appeared on my hanky every time that I sneezed. What brought on the excess of work? The big project I finished for Electronic Information Retrieval on Sunday, the Midsemester Exam I spent most of Monday evening finishing for launch, the landslide of emails I replied to from my students, and the excess of personal projects I had going. Note to self: Self, you're a little old lady now. LOLs don't *have* to burn the candle at both ends. In fact, they may not be *able* to burn the candle at both ends. Think about it! End of note to self.

I got to watch _Milk_ Wednesday night. (My final personal project before the Crash of 2009.) My honey flew me out to the livingroom and we popped the newly arrived DVD into the player. Damn! that's one fine film. We plan to watch it again tonight after supper. I love it as a well-made film and I love it as a reminder of my own involvement in LGBT activism (which we called gay lib at the time) back in the 70s. (The latter's bittersweet. I miss being part of an LGBT community and spending most of my time with lesbian and bisexual women. In the past 20 years, I've come to love Harry deeply, but I do *not* love the straight communities we live in. I still sometimes wonder if I'd known what it would cost me if I'd have loved and married him. But I did. And I've no intention of unmarrying him.)

Friday I began to feel better, although I wasn't a powerhouse of energy, the sinus infection was still with me, and towards evening my guts turned on me, too. Today is better--without the complications or reservations. My blood sugar's running a bit high. (We had quarter pounders at lunch.) However, my bones, joints, and muscles, sinuses, and bowels are all back in working order. Yay!

I'm still thinking about going into a rehabilitation hospital for intensive physical therapy (assuming my new doctor likes the idea). It has its good points, but it has its not-so-good ones and uncertainties, too. The good points are that they have enough equipment and personnel to assure I won't get hurt doing the necessary exercises and practices to get up and at 'em again. Also that I would receive therapy 3 or 4 times a day instead of twice a week. The not-so-good points are that I don't *want* to be institutionalized for 2-3 (or 4-6, depending on who you ask) weeks, away from my home and family, and that 3 0r 4 sessions of physical therapy in one day is uncomfortably (to put it mildly) like some of the medieval tortures that involved pushing joints beyond their natural limits. (And me a pain wimp!) Also, many of my companions in the center will be recovering from strokes or otherwise permanently or temporarily severely mentally impaired. (Peeps like that both frighten and depress me. I'm not proud of that, but they do. Every psychotherapist has groups s/he can't work with, and peeps with those sorts of cognitive impairments are on my No Can Do List.) I'm betting that the staff have a tendency to treat all of the patients as mentally defective (because it's a common misconception that persons with physical disabilities are also retarded/mentally impaired--and healthcare personnel aren't immune to the misconception), and I will *not* like that! The uncertainty is whether or not all that suffering will have the desired effect. No one can guarantee that if I serve time in the hospital I'll be able to do wheelchair transfers afterward. Scary shit, huh? Stay tuned. Wonder Woman and her new doc will be making a decision sometime not too far hence.

Well, I bummed myself out thinking about the fracking rehab hospital. That was just brilliant. I'm sorry, guys. Some days Wonder Woman has feet of Play-Doh. Next time I'll try to be cheerier.
(I didn't mean to go to this place this time.)

That's all. I love you all, although at the moment I wonder why you love me.

Have a great weekend, what's left of it!

On the other hand, I discovered that after re-certification day Mara will no longer be my therapist. (She's going to work for another company as of April.) Damn! I wish I could continue working with her because we have great rapport *and* she's big enough at 5'11"" that I totally trust her not to let me fall. BTW, I forgot to tell you guys but near-daily flights have resume. Mara has me come up front and do things six days a week. (The seventh just can't be worked into our schedules.)

"event","I just realized that I don't remember what day I posted here last--which is usually a dead giveaway that I should post again. I have a few free minutes, too, because my home healthcare nurse had to cancel our appointment this morning. Her sons were in a car wreck last night,and she needs to be at the hospital this morning to arrange for aspects of their care (one decision of which involves surgery). She's very proud of her boys and talks about them a lot, so I hope they're going to be okay.

I meant to post yesterday, but Harry & I run-arounds with Blue Cross/Blue Shield that left me too tired and bummed out to do so. Dr. Anbarasu hasn't dismissed me as a patient, but as I'm pretty sure I told you, she won't write me an more prescriptions until I come see her at her office--which I'm not quite rehabilitated enough to do (although we're getting there). Dr. Menard at the TWU Student Health Services, who used to be my doctor before I was on insurance, is calling my maintenance drugs in temporarily, but that's all she can reasonably do for me. So what's the big problem? My prescriptions for home healthcare and physical therapy will expire on Wednesday, March 25th--and I can only be re-certified by prescription. We've been trying like crazy to find a doctor who makes house calls that's on my Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan. Until yesterday, I hadn't successfully completed a call with BC/BS about it because I'd get put on hold and the customer service rep wouldn't come back on line for 20+ minutes. (I hang up after 20 minutes. I'm not usually bloody minded enough to persist.) Well, yesterday I tried a different BC/BS number, and I learned from their rep that I need coordinated home medical care. Guess who has to sign off on it (and apparently has done so heretofore). My PCP. Dr. Anbarasu. So...in a very sympathetic way I got told that we need to talk to her. (I would love to, but Nurse Ratch...I mean, her nurse and office manager Vickie...won't *let* me. Supposedly Vickie has to let me, but nobody seems to have told her that! <biggest headdesk in the world, times 10 or 12> Harry called back during the afternoon and talked to a company nurse (not basic rep) and basically she confirmed that, although she gave him various suggestions for getting directly to Dr. A. So...we'll be frantically trying some of those and/or to make it into the office before March 25th, but it's a clusterfuck. No doubt about it. A genuine Grade AAA unmitigated clusterfuck. (For the record, once I'm properly rehabilitated and able to get out and about Dr. Anbarasu is going to be *so* fired! History. Just a blip on Vi's medical history. Everyone--including BC/BS--has told us, as if they needed to, to get a new PCP. Gee! Do ya think? <furious grumbling & head shaking>) And that's about all the medical news that's fit...

Other than wrangling with the medical/insurance industry, I've been doing the usual. Teaching. Learning. Enjoying life with my sweetie. Reading. (The latest of the latter are _Permanent Partners: Building Gay & Lesbian Relationships That Last_ by Betty Berzon and the rest of _Kissing the Hag_ by Emma Restall Orr. I'm liking Orr's book better than I thought I was going to for awhile, but I'm still not sure what my ultimate opinion of it will be.) I have a busy weekend ahead of me. I'll be creating a midsemester exam for my students, writing a major report for my Electronic Information Retrieval professor, and furiously attempting to throw a first draft of my writing project together for Dr. Brock. Or, in the case of the latter, furiously trying to get that first daft started. Whee! Nobody count on hearing from me between tomorrow night and Monday--'kay?

That's all for the moment. I hope each of you is happy and doing well, or (at the very least) as well as can be expected. I don't have time to proofread this, so please excuse my typos in advance. (I'm sure at least a few have gotten through!)

"event","So it's not a bad idea to make time to do so now.

It's been a good week, all in all. Quite a lot of ""same old same old,"" but as I've read some of your lj entries this week and given the matter thought I've come to the realization that habitual patterns of behavior are perhaps more a characteristic of human life general than an indicator that my own life is ""dull, dull, dull"" (to anyone and everyone outside my skin). I invested a lot of time in reading emails from students and colleagues and replying to them, I read a lot for school and still more for pleasure, I did physical therapy to my therapist's satisfaction, I enjoyed my husband's company, I ate three square meals and a snack (all diabetic friendly) every day. That's pretty much what my life looks like during any given week, and I'm one of those fortunate Homo saps who enjoys her life for the most part.

To get a bit more specific on a few items: My for-pleasure reading for the week included _A Book of Beasts_ by Nigel Pennick (beautifully illustrated by Helen Fielding) and about half of _Kissing the Hag_ by Emma Restall Orr. I liked the former even more than I thought I would (and I expected to like it a lot!), and I'm liking the latter a bit less than I expected to so far. They're both above-average in my book--an A for Pennick and a B for Orr. I'm still familiarizing Ted Andrews' _Animal-Wise_ tarot deck with me (and vice versa). I like it a great deal overall, but his Water suite, Shapeshifters, is hard for me to get used to because he went with insects rather than sea creatures--and I'm an insectophobe where leaping, and some flying, insects are concerned. (His choice for fluid Water makes some sense, though, because insects really *are* shapeshifters, with juvenile forms that don't much resemble their adult forms in many cases and ""fun"" things things like chrysalises and molts. I'm also in the process of reading Kim Harrison's latest novel of the Hollows, _White Witch, Black Curse_. I've liked all the Rachel Morgan novels to date, but halfway through I know this is going to be my favorite.

Re: physical therapy. I did okay on Monday but not brilliantly. (Harry & I actually got into a spat about it on Tuesday because he thought I resisted my therapist in a prideful or egotistic way until we talked it out.) Yesterday, though. Well, yesterday I made all three of us very, very happy. I stood up without heistant three different times for 15 seconds each without Mara helping me rise or having to keep her hand on my back. For our next ""trick"" we're going to see if I can stand longer at a time, and then we're going to see if I can gradually stand without her supporting my leg with her leg. That will finish re-learning standing and take us to the brink of the indoor transfer. Wish me luck? I've got stuff I want to do away from the apartment by April. Really!

Not a big posting, I know--but I've got other Stuff to do, and the afternoon's not getting any younger. I don't have time to proofread this either, so I hope there aren't too many typos.

I hope each of you is having a delightful weekend. I look forward to reading more of your postings.

I love you.

I'm done with commenting on and grading students' postings for the week, and I don't yet have to start turning in my own assignments for the week. I can nap or kick back with a read-for-pleasure book without guilt or watch a video in the middle of the afternoon or whatever. I see Juanita (my current visiting nurse) on Thursdays, but she's already come and gone by 11:00am. And then the day is mine--all mine! *deliriously happy if somewhat manicky laughter*

I'm currently finishing up _Arab Women: Between Defiance and Restraint_ and getting into _Kissing the Hag: The Dark Goddess and the Unacceptable Nature of Women_ by Emma Restall Orr. (Orr is one of three woman Neo-Druids whose books I enjoy reading. Ellen Evert Hopman is another, and I can't remember the third woman's name for love nor money.)

I know. If anyone ever founds Bookaholics Anonymous, I should definitely consider joining a chapter. (You guys are a fine bunch to talk,though!

We're doing leftovers for lunch--the rest of the Pork Chops with Sweet Potatoes & Mandarin Oranges that we had on Sunday. 'S okay. Good leftovers are...well, good eats. Harry plans to make Cod Florentine tonight,which will be even more fun. (Had I mentioned lately that I love my diabetic cookbooks?)

(BTW, my blood sugars are doing really well, 'Lique. They've been running in my ideal range when I take them in the morning, and sub par for most pre-lunch and pre-supper measurements. I've needed a bedtime snack everyday for weeks now, which is what my doctor and nurses want in the interests of keeping everything as even as possible throughout the day. How's you're own been doing? Last I'd heard was back when it was delighted to get home from Central/Eastern Europe and not get feed a ton of carbs at every meal!)

Time to fade. I can't think of much more to say. Oh, no Mara in the morning, but Kristi's supposed to come on Saturday. (She's Mara's supervisor and has to see me once a month.) I hope everyone's week is rocking along fairly smoothly. If not, though, hang in there! We're *almost* to the weekend.

With my leg(s) in the right position for a bipedal gig. (No Quasimodo effect today.) What's funny is, I probably could have gone past 15 seconds, but my right hand, which like its partner had a death grip on my walker, succumbed to pain from its wrist and told my mouth to gasp,""Gotta sit down!"" before my whole right side could fold. *sigh* If it ain't one damn' thing, it's another. But I'm deliriously happy and Harry & Mara are happy, too, so Life Is Good. (She does want him to buy me a wrist brace, though, and for me to do some exercises to strengthen the wrist. ""Oh, the wrist bone's connected to the arm bones, and the arm bones are connected to the shoulder, and the shoulder..."" You get the picture! };->)

My weekend went reasonably well, and yours? We had miso soup, salad, sushi, and sashimi from Royal Asian Friday night. (Harry gave me a cup of his sake, too.) BIG yum! Saturday was deliciously lazy. Yesterday I did a blend of school stuff, watching episodes of _The Prisoner_, and reading for pleasure. I would have liked an extra day of weekend this time, but ya can't win 'em all!

Today, I have _lots_ of schoolwork planned. Writing a quiz, grading forum postings, holding virtual office hours (from the teacher side), and working on my thesis (or will it be a writing project?) as a student. (I should be working on the next module for Electronic Information Retrieval, too, but there. Are. Not. Enough. Hours. In a day!)

That's all for this morning. I need to move closer to some of that ""from the teacher side"" foo.

A great day to one & all, wherever you are in the day's embrace.

"event","I dropped by to thank those of you who shared in my joy over yesterday's success in physical therapy and have a few minutes left before I have to busy myself with something else, so I thought I'd say hi. Good morning, everyone! (Or good whatever time of day it is where you are.

I've been up since 6:30 again--not my preferred rising time, but Harry had to go for a fasting blood sugar this morning at 8:30 and we didn't want to put my breakfast off that late. It's been a relatively quiet morning. I've read and answered a few emails, but not the avalanche of them I found in my inbox yesterday morning. I haven't resumed grading forum postings yet today; I'm saving that for this afternoon and early this evening. (It's not like they'll get graded without me, is it? };->)

Last night I started reading a book that arrived in the mail yesterday. It's _The Man of Reason: ""Male"" and ""Female"" in Western Philosophy_, 2nd edition by Genevieve Lloyd. It's one of those books I decided to read while working on my MA in Women's Studies that I just never got a ""round tuit"" for. (I was exposed to it because AnaLouise had us read a chapter dealing mostly with Descartes when I took Feminist Epistemologies.) I came across a good copy, cheap online a few weeks ago and decided, ""Now's as good a time as any!"" I finished around have of it last night. (The text is only around 110-pages long. With any luck, I'll get to read the rest today. It's an interesting book. Since it's a second edition, one of the most fascinating things about it so far has been reading in the introduction how the book's reception, plus the publication of other works on women and philosophy since Lloyd wrote the first edition, influenced her to make the changes she did in the second edition. I got as far as the chapter on Descartes and Hume last night. (She begins with Socrates/Plato.) The rest extends fro Rousseau through contemporary philosophers. Oh, another fascinating portion of Lloyd's text (for me) dealt with how Augustine tried to present a *less* misogynistic view of women and reason than his predecessors had. (I'm accustomed to thinking of Auggie as the epitome of a woman-hater, but not so much... *sigh*)

(Aside to Wooly: Amazon notified me today that it's going to be another month before _Beyond the Burning Times_ is available again. I haven't just forgotten it.)

Well, my few minutes are up. I've got other fish to fry now. So...

"event","Good morning, peeps!

Mara (my physical therapist) paid a visit this morning and before she left I managed (with lots of assistance and posture somewhere between Lucy and the Hunchback of Notre Dame) to stand up twice for a few seconds each time. So? So--hello!--I haven't stood up at all in close to five months. I was happy. (Make that ""delirious."") Harry was happy. Mara was happy. She'll be back on Friday and, among other things, I'll stand up some more. Woot! 

Otherwise, I'm a bizzy instructor this morning. I just finished grading Minor Quiz 1 and posting Minor Quiz 2. I also verified my 12th-day rolls (i.e., confirmed that the administration and I are in agreement as to who my students are). This afternoon I'll need to grade more Week 2 Discussion Board forums and tonight I have virtual office hours, but for the next few minutes my instructorly labors are done. (Hey, I've got to be caught up *sometimes*!)

I'm still trying to decide whether to write a thesis (as a grad student) or to opt out and complete a writing project instead. (I think I told you guys that Dr. Brock gave me that choice last Thursday.) Any opinions from the room as to  which way I should jump. (Yeah, yeah, Wooly. I ""know*. You want me to do a writing project and a thesis and publish several articles while I wait to get back into a doc program. Read my lips: It will never happen!) I'm leaning toward the writing project (because I don't *want* to be a lab-coated demon when I grow up), but I really am still open to both options. Some of my best friends are lab-coated--nah, we're not gonna go there. I wouldn't mind/strenuously object to writing a thesis.

I got glad tidings from my FRP (Faculty Resource Person) yesterday that not only would she and the chair of the program like for me to apply to teach in the 2009-2010 academic year, but they would be happy for me to continue as an adjunct after I graduate. Let's hear it for job security! (Hey, we *are* in a recession...)

I'd better close. I have another thing or two do before lunch.

Have a great day!

"event","Well, my weekend (which is coasting to an end now) has been a good one. I hope each of you can say the same.

I stayed on the computer quite a bit yesterday, but almost entirely on BlackBoard and answering emails from students and a colleague who's new at teaching undergraduate women's studies online. Looks like MOS today, but I'm okay with that. At least (unlike *last* weekend) I'm not having to paddle my little canoe furiously just to keep from sinking!

Harry & I started watching our DVDs of _The Prisoner_ last night. I haven't seen it since I was in my 20s; Harry, since he was in his teens. We're enjoying it. (Sadly, what made us think to order the series a couple of weeks back was Patrick McGoohan's death.) As those of you who know me at all well can surely imagine, Number 6 was a big hero of mine back in the day (when my anti-authoritarian personality had yet to mellow out at all)! It's good to revisit that younger, wilder me--although I've got to admit she was never as happy as I am now. (And strange to say, I *am* happy more often than not nowadays. Unfortunately, I don't always think to share my joy. Go figure! I'll try to do better.)

I ordered three new diabetic cookbooks at the beginning of the year, and we've actually started making dishes from them on a regular basis this week. Two of them were selected for cook-friendliness (i.e., for having easy-to-make recipes). Those are the ones we're working out of first. (The third has some great recipes for when it's the weekend, though, and Harry has a bit more time to futz about in the kitchen.) Last night we had Pork Chops a la Mexicana; tonight, we're planning on Ground Beef & Cabbage Casserole, which is similar to Stuffed Cabbage but without having to hollow out and stuff the cabbage. (You chop the cabbage up and cook everything in a Dutch oven.)

I finished reading _A Field Guide to Otherkin_ last night. I liked it, all in all. That's not too surprising, though, since (for the most part) I like the peeps I know who would classify as 'kin, I have a longstanding interest in the related phenomena of shamanism (in its various classic, core, and neo varieties) and totemism, and I can relate to relating to other species as, well, as family. (That and I'm not all that easily weirded out. I've never in my entire life thought we should all be little carbon copies of one another! And especially not conservative, rigidly rationalistic ones...)

This is fun and I'm glad I decided to post here today, but I'd better get back to being an instructor in undergrad women's studies for now. I've other things I need to do *after* lunch and it's almost lunch now. So...have a great day, each and every one of you!

"event","Here I am, back again. But I haven't posted in several days, or read you good peeps postings. I'm a bit out of touch. Again. Yet. Still.

I'm almost entirely recovered from my asthmatic bronchitis now. I'm down to using my nebulizer once a day, and I hardly use my rescue inhaler at all. I know the flaming groundhog saw his shadow on Monday, but Texas is a long way away from Pennsylvania. If Old Man Winter will just relax and loosen up his grip on North Central Texas, I should be fine. That's not asking too much, is it? I mean, it's gonna feel like early Summer here by May 1st!

The bizzy is work related. The Spring semester started three weeks ago, and the beginning of every semester--almost the first half--is a bit rough. Some people are slow studies and don't figure out what they're doing, in an online environment, for a few weeks. Some people who don't really want to do the work don't drop out for a few weeks. The university wants tons of extra (electronic) ""paper"" work for the first full weeks. Yadda, yadda, yadda...

Then there's the fact that I'm keep a magickal journal right now, too, and that puppy requires an entry a day whether I wanna or not. At least, it does if I wanna be a good magician, which I do. *sigh* And me not that fond of journaling to start with!

So...that's my excuses for being a poor livejournalist, I guess!

What's been happening in my life? Well, besides bronchitis, the new semester, and my magickal journal, let's see...

I have a new home healthcare nurse. Rose didn't work out, so now I'm seeing a nurse named Juanita Blackwell once a week. She's a better fit. Yay!

My doctor will no longer call prescriptions in for me, because she hasn't seen me in (well) over six months now and it's not her policy to base treatment on nurses' and lab reports. (If you're wondering why she ordered the home healthcare nurses then, that makes *two* of us!) I take six different maintenance meds, so I'm currently trying to find a doctor in Denton on a Blue Cross/Blue Shield panel who visits homebound patients. Dr. A will write a referral to him or her. Otherwise? Otherwise, I'm shit out of luck! So...wish me luck? I'm not interested in seeing how well I can do with uncontrolled diabetes. Been there. Done that. *Hate* the damned tee-shirt.

Given my current mobility problems, my graduate advisor has asked if I'd like to do a writing project rather than a thesis. I'm considering it. (Wooly, before you growl at me I have never, at any time said I want to be a research scientist. There's room for them in the world, but that's not who I am. Besides, I haven't accepted, or refused, Dr. Brock's proposal. It's still under consideration.)

I finished _Gifts of the Golden God_ and am still reading _Arab Women: Between Defiance & Restraint_, plus _A Field Guide to _Otherkin_, which I started last night. It's about peeps who self-identify with/as non-human beings. Such peeps range from those who identify with terrestrial animals to those who identify with mythological animals to those who identify with vampires to those who identify with elves or fairies to... Well, you get the picture, I'm sure. It's an interesting read. Some of the identifying could be consider rational (even by non-magickal folks), and some of it can only be considered pretty out there. Examples of the former would be metaphorical identification, personal mythology, and psychological identification. Examples of the latter would include claims of physical shapeshifting, reincarnational claims, and claims based on being genetically odd in some way as evidence of non-human status. Dull it ain't! The author surveyed 130 participants (self-selected, of course) for her study.

That's about all the news that's fit. I'll try to read some of your postings later today. My favorite ""spice of life"": catch-up!

Have a great day, my friends.

How do you post an original thread on a Discussion Board forum?"" etc. I'm getting more work done on the outline for my thesis and in my Electronic Information Retrieval course. (In the latter, we had an assignment called--honest to God!--""Pick 3,"" in which we described the three databases we use the most as graduate students. Mine were PsycINFO, the Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Family & Society Studies Worldwide, all of which are actually subsets of EBSCO Host as ""one Db to bind them all, one Db to find them..."" Umm, you get the warty picture, I'm sure!) In two more weeks, I'm sure I'll be a bit blase both about what I'm teaching and what I'm studying. Blase isn't a wonderful feeling, but it doesn beat ""in the midst of an anxiety attack.""

I haven't said much here, but--guess what--I'm not feeling very talkative today. I just didn't want to go days and weeks without posting.

My physical therapy is still going well, although we're a bit behind due to Mara missing a yesterday due to unmelted ice. The social worker came out today. Medical madness ain't to mad this week--may all the Gods at once be thanked!

"event","Just when you were afraid that Vi's life was turning into one interminably long & snarky pity party, something went right! When Mara came out to do physical therapy with me today, she told Harry he needs to get me a sturdy walker that will support my considerable weight before she sees us again next Wednesday. Why? Because we're going to practice having me stand up with it's assistance. This is mind-blowing news, guys, because standing up is the preliminary to doing wheelchair transfers, first in the apartment and then (when I've regained my confidence and built up strength in my leg muscles) from wheelchair to car. Escape is in sight. Woo-hoo!

Something else that's going well in my life is that Dr. Brock & I are shooting for me to have the prospectus for my thesis written and approved by April 1st. If that happens, I can begin gathering my data during the summer. Wouldn't that be absolutely bitchin'?

I'm reading two interesting books. (I don't think I've told you about them) yet. The first is _Arab Women: Between Defiance and Restraint_, edited by Suha Sabbagh, which is an anthology of essays by Arab feminists (and, no, that *isn't* an oxymoron--which is one of the main points of the anthology. Being an anthology, quality varies from author to author but overall I'm well pleased with it. The other book is _Gifts of the Golden God_, a devotional about/for Frey. I'm enjoying reading it, too. It's certainly not academic, but since the editor (who uses the pen name Sigrun Freyskona) is a self-described ""bad Heathen,"" it *is* interesting. (""Bad Heathens"" aren't bad-ass Asatruar; they're Asatruar who are unpopular with their fellow Heathen's because they're too free-thinking in their theology and/or too tolerant of Wiccans, LGBT folks, non Norse-Germanic folks, or other folks mainstream Asatruar tend to get the pip about. 

My new statue of Odin arrived today, too. It's gorgeous! I can't wait to show it off to Angelique & Wolfie. He's depicted sitting on his throne with his wolves at his feet, one of his ravens on an arm of the throne, and the other raven perched on his shoulder as if just landing/getting ready to take flight. Now if someone would please just do a really classy Frey statue!

I need to quit so I can lie down and rest my legs awhile.

I hope each of you is having a bang-up Friday, which will kick off a great weekend.

"event","Your Vi was a silly rabbit yesterday, peeps. She sat up from around 9:00am till after 10:00pm with only one one-hour break. This was very foolish on her part, because she has edema in her legs and lower abdomen and isn't *supposed* to sit up for long stretches at a time. What happened? Well, first of all I watched the inauguration because I like the pomp and circumstance of same and especially when I voted for the wining candidate. That was a good two hours or so. Afterward, I settled down to have lunch and wait for the RN to arrive to re-certify me for home healthcare. I expected that to be easy, a visit less than an hour long like when I was first enrolled for home healthcare or when I re-certified for PT last weekend. Boy, was I wrong! It was the fracking Medical Inquisition. I spent a little over three and a half hours reviewing my case with the nice nurse (which she was), and I was physically and emotional wrung out when she left. That's when I snagged my hour-long nap. Then it was back up for supper and afterward I had to do my work as an instructor, part of which I'd counted on doing during the afternoon. (Yesterday was the first day of Spring classes, so I spent lots of time emailing students who had enrollment problems, hadn't gotten their textbooks on time, didn't understand their first assignment, etc. Plus I had the Week 1 prompts to write. Oy!) By the time I finished, it was well past 10:00pm. Harry & I stretched out to watch _Scanners_ in bed and then we slept the sleep of the just--the just exhausted!

Today seems to be going better. However, I'm very tired and I'm having to lie down and stretch out my legs a lot to keep the edema's effects (achyness and pain) down to a dull roar. Will Vi *ever* be so stupid again. Probably. But she likes to think not.

Harry will be home in a sec. He's been down at the university teaching his first classes of the semester. Then lunch and afterward maybe a nice nap. (*Very* nice.) At the very least, I can loll about in bed for a couple of hours before tackling anything else.

I hope each of you is having a great day!

(2) I've been busy getting materials ready to teach my Spring courses. (3) Journaling isn't one of my favorite activities in the world. Still, I'm not ready/willing to disappear for another year so I'm not going to give up.

I got to spend time with Wooly & Mama Bear on Sunday. That was very pleasant. Harry & I got them brunch from Hannah's while they were here and a pretty good time seems to have been had by all. They gave us a basic digital camera for a Christmas present, which was great--because Harry's wanted one for awhile but I didn't know what a good start camera would be to order him one online. I also very much enjoyed it when MB brought some of the photos of their trip to London up to show us. (Especially the ones from Stonehenge & Avebury.) It looks like they really had a great time abroad. The only regrettable thing about their visit was that I couldn't stop coughing, which was embarrassing and made it difficult to chat with them. 

This afternoon I'll pop the last of my materials into my BlackBoard shells for Spring 2009 and make my cyberclassrooms available for my students to preview. IME, distance learners--especially first-time distance learners relax a bit if they can see what they're going to be doing in advance. And a week from today, it's back into the fray. Whee!

I just read a book called _From Asgard to Valhalla_ by a reader in Norse lit at Oxford named O'Donoghue. It was basic but pretty good. The one thing that seemed a bit about it was that she seems to think that although Norse mythology isn't instrinsically racist, any attempt to pursue Neo-Heathenism is doomed to be. Since I know quite a few Asatru and Vanatru folks who don't strike me as particularly racist, let's just say I have some issues with that. *sigh*

I haven't been around in a few days because that asthma of mine took yet another turn for the worse. After talking to Dr. Anbarasu's office, I discovered I have not *just* my asthma but--ta-da!--yet another round of chronic bronchitis. (No infection this time, though--may all the Gods at once be thanked!) So...I'm on a four nebulizer treatments a day with Albuterol for a month. (Joy!) I started taking my treatments yesterday, and I'm already feeling somewhat better. By Friday, I should feel Damn Near Human. Well, it's good to know it's something familiar and treatable, at least (as opposed to unknown and untreatable).

Since this is New Year's Eve (or, in some places, even New Year's), I thought I'd drop by for a sec and wish all of you peeps a very happy, healthy, and prosperous 2009.

To recap the ""holly daze"": We had walnut pancakes and bacon for breakfast. (My body tolerates pancakes once a week. I don't even have to eat carefully to have them.) We ate the big meal of the day around midafternoon, so my system would have time to deal with the carbs. We had green olives, ripe olives, sugarfree bread & butter pickles, marinated artichoke heart salad, and aged extra-sharp cheddar as appetizers. The main course consisted of rib roast, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, green bean casserole, and cranberry sauce, and we ate mince meat pie (""leaded"") for dessert. Around 8:00pm all that had worn off, so we had more roast and some sugarfree fruitcake for dessert. Harry watched a movie after supper and I read awhile.

As I said, I woke up feeling dreadful yesterday. My clogged up sinuses had clogged up my ears, resulting in both tinnitis *and* pseudo-motion sickness. (I'd move my head, my ears would snap, crackle, and pop, and my stomach would lurch.) Joy! While Harry was off getting a haircut and grocery shopping for the week, I slid in and out of weird dreams. (In one series, people--presumably thieves--were wandering around in the livingroom and templeroom, but assured me I would be all right as long as I stayed in my bedroom. In real life, I had knocked my phone off the nightstand and couldn't reach it--which feature was also true in my dream--I couldn'r reach the phone to call 911. In the other series of weird dreams, Harry & I went for a car ride--I was an ambulatory, non-wheelchair using person--and after we drove through a fog, we ended up in a really creepy alternate America where the civil rights movement, women's movement, gay liberation, etc., had never happened but a limited nuclear exchange had. A ""colored"" woman who had two illegitimate children because she wasn't able to marry their white father was trying to help us get back to our own time if we'd take her children with us. I don't know how that dream would have ended, because Harry came home.) While he'd been out shopping, he'd found a personal DVD player on sale at Best Buys, where he'd ducked in to get me a copy of _Burn After Reading_. He'd tried to call me twice to ask if he should get it, but I hadn't answered. (Remember? I'd knocked the phone on the floor in the waking world.) So after lunch he went back and got it and I watched two--count em: two--movies yesterday: _Sunshine_ and _Burn After Reading_. (And, yes, the latter was every bit as funny as I'd hoped it would be!) I went to bed still slightly nauseous from the thing with my ears, but woke up feeling all right this morning.

That, in a nutshell, is what Vi's been up to the past two days. Today's okay, except I wish I had more oomph! (My sinuses and bronchial tubes are clear this morning. Of course, we have a cold front rolling in this evening... Ah, joy!)

BTW, Harry wandered down to Wine on the Square last night and got us some bubbly (a sparkling Chardonnay) for New Year's Eve. Can you believe that 2008 is almost a done deed, peeps? And what a year it's been! (Personally and for the public.) Enjoy this last weekend of 2008. Be safe but very, very merry! (Especially those of you who are currently in Merrie Olde, where I understand from my lj there have been balrog and Panzerbjorn sightings recently. ;->) I love you each and all deeply and contentedly. You German ladies do in the old year in style as well. Pat_gund, be well! (My own struggles with incipitent bronchitis have made me very mindful of your health.) Angelique & Wolfie, blessings on your house & home!

"event","Since Sunday, I've been enjoying (?) badly clogged sinuses and bronchial tubes--plus a little extra bone & joint pain, just to keep things interesting. (Marah thinks a new exercise she taught me caused the latter, so she's having me back off it till next week.) The respiratory crud was weather related. Rapidly alternate the daytime highs between the 70s and the 30s a few times and I get wheezy and snotted up every time. (Isn't it great to know you can rely on your body to behave predictably? ;->) Today I feel better, albeit weak. Since no blizzards are scheduled for the weekend, I'll probably stay well. (Huzzah!)

We had Top Shelf guacamole and Mama Cuellar's tamales for our Christmas Eve supper. They were very good and so was the 72% cacao chocolate bar (with chipotle pepper and curry) that we split for dessert. I can have moderate amounts of high-chocolate chocolate, because over about 65% they can't jam enough sugar in to hurt me. The chocolate bar was from our favorite candy store on the Square, where my sweetie also picked me up a pound of sugarfree chocolates as a last-minute Christmas prezzie. He's a good Harry, he is--a very, very, very good Harry! (Are you listening, Santa?) Currently he's watching _Scrooged!_ in the livingroom (ah, for a flight!), and I've been reading more of Ihde's book on Ricouer's hermenutic phenomenology.

Tomorrow's another day. Christmas Day. Not as wonderful as Yule for us, but full of cultural meanings dating back to our childhoods. If I feel good, I'll tell you about it when it happens.

I hope you're having a lovely Christmas Eve--or a very Merry Christmas, if the new day has already reached you. I send you my love and best wishes, my affection and my hope that 2009 will be a good year for you.

Brightest blessings of the season!

I didn't post yesterday because I got myself well and properly tired. We got up early to eat breakfast before my 9:00am appointment with the physical therapist (which went well). Then I used the rest of the morning to do various ""stuff"" (e.g., emails) before Angelique, Wolfie, and the MU would arrive to spend the afternoon with us. We had a very pleasant afternoon, but by the time they left to go home (around six) my energy had crated and my back was screaming from having set up on the edge of the bed for more than six hours straight. (Suffice it to say, I did *not* get a second set of PT exercises done last night--although Kristie had said that, under the circumstances, it would be okay if I didn't!)

This has been a right lazy day. We had bagel and omlettes for breakfast. (My omlette was cheese and sage sausage, but Harry put onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper in his.) Then we lay about and read for while. Then we ate shrimp korma leftovers for lunch. Then we read some more, following which we took a nap. Harry ran to the grocery store and the mall for awhile to get a present (pastry tray) for the Student Health Services and a candle to burn for a friend who's been depressed for awhile. I got in another round of reading while he was gone. (I've been reading in Rankine & d'Este's _Practical Elemental Magick_ today, having just finished their _Practical Planetary Magick_ last night. Both books are pretty good. I'd classify them as intermediate-level books on their subjects, which is unusual in and of itself. Most books on the elements or the planets are for beginning magicians.)

It's around five now. Harry just announced his intention to start supper in around 30 more minutes. (Woo-hoo!) We're going to have baked chicken (leg quarters), fingerling potatoes (buttered), and brussel sprouts. I'm not sure what yet, but I'll find something yummy but sugarfree for dessert.

After dinner, I'll probably do more reading--although I keep threatening to download a movie from Netflix to watch on my computer. (We plan to get me a personal DVD player after the first of the year, when more money comes in. A girl can only last so long without films--or, at the very least, movies! ;->) 

Well, this isn't much of a posting, but then it hasn't exactly been a rollicking day either. Sorry about that, folks! I hope each of you is having a very pleasant (and hopefully more exciting) day than I am. I love you, think of you often, and wish you well.

I mean just look at the three most recent clinkers you've sent my way. Monday night there was what I call the _Cloverfield_/""Masque of the Red Death/_The Legend of Hell House_ melange. What was *that* crap about? Tuesday night there was the Got Fired & Lost My Medical Coverage effort. That one makes some sort of sense, but the disgusting details were just a bit Over the Top. And last night? How fun it was to have a rambling, confused epic of difficult breathing. First I dreamed I had sleep apnea but couldn't get treatment because I didn't want Harry to know I had yet another chronic disease. Then it transmuted into a dream in which an unknown per (male, of course) was strangling me. And finally it a conspiracy dream in which Harry & this Nathan Fillion-type good ol' boy are giving me small doses of a poison that would eventually cause respiratory failure. What the fuck?! That one at least was somewhat grounded in reality, because I woke up needing to use my rescue inhaler. But then there was the sequel: writing a brilliant paper on the works of Paul Ricouer, only about have the works I was writing about weren't *by* Ricouer. All right, ya moron! I need my beauty sleep. I do, I do, I do! Tone it down a few pegs, will ya? Send me some dreams that don't wake me up in a panic and/or massive confusion. Better yet, send me a few I can't even remember. I know you're a censor, but if there's something unpleazzy I need to know, send it to me in an intelligible manner so I can figure it out for myself and deal. You are being a royal *pain*!!!"

"event","Well, I seem to be catching up on my sleep. I got a sound six hours last night, which is about as long as I can sleep at one time, and I snagged a nap late this afternoon. I no longer feel like the Sandman has taken a major hit out on me. (Huzzah!) On the other hand (that warty one!), I feel like I've been mugged by a freight train tonight because I started my physical therapy this afternoon.

Marah (my physical therapist) is a cute puppy and, as the job requires, she's strict when we're working my muscles over...I mean, out. (BTW, don't let the ""strict...as the job requires"" make you think she's a closet Dom. She's very mellow; she just knows that where PT's concerned, ""no pain, no gain"" is true.) To my great relief, Marah told me that I still have excellent tone in my back and leg muscles. As she put it, my muscles have just stopped recognizing orders from my brain, and we need to work together to get them to do so. She feels confident that I can regain the ability to stand and pivot without too much trouble, which was music to my ears because a Vi who can stand and pivot can get in and out of her wheelchair and in and out of the family car. She does *not* think I'll regain the ability to hop, which is pretty much what everyone concerned thinks. But you know what? Old Dingbats don't *have* to hop. We're exempt from that, rather like we're exempt from menstruation. :-)

I didn't finish reading _The Real Witches' Coven_ yesterday, because I wound up doing some other stuff instead. However, I now have only ten pages or so to go. I've read enough to know that I would probably recommend it to most peeps rather than the much longer but somewhat less informative _Coven Craft_. I still think Judy Harrow's book on coven managment is better than either West's or Amber K's, though. (West's isn't strictly speaking, on coven managment *only*, however. Nor is Amber K's.)

I taught Harry how to order books from amazon.com last night, so now I'm assured of getting Yule prezzies from my sweetie. (I was anyhow but now he won't have to hare all around Denton looking for them!) He was surprised, and pleased, to discover how user-friendly online shopping can be. (Of course, that Amazon is about as friendly as an online merchant gets! Which is why I sometimes affectionately call her the Ama-slut. ;->)

Harry saw Dr. Menard again today and she told him that his cyst is healing well--no significant residual infection, although he has to finish taking his antibiotics, of course. She wants to see him again on Friday, but I think that will be his last cyst-related visit. They discussed his back and leg, too. She wants him to get a PCP as soon as possible (he just signed up for insurance through the university as his employer) so he can get a referral to an orthopedist. In the meantime, he can take his painkillers and get a little isometric exercise and perhaps bicycle a bit. So...he's getting better now, too. (Double yay!)

That's pretty much all the news that's fit today. More manana.

I hope all of you are doing well, looking forward to your end-of-the-year holidays, and feeling happy.

"event","Well, yesterday evening at 5:00pm TWU's Fall 2008 semester came to an end. I managed to get the last of my students' grades posted at around 4:00pm. I had already completed my work as a student for the semester on Friday, December 5th. So...another semester is now history. Yay! How do I feel about the Fall 2008 semester? Pretty *darned* good, actually. However, physically I'm worn out. Nothing that a couple of good night's sleep won't mend, but if I could walk, I promise you I'd be walking into walls today. Cripes, I feel like the Sandman came armed for *bear*! (No respect intended to your power beast, MB. I just named them because they're notoriously difficult to tranq!)

Dr. Burns posted the grades on our portfolios and our course grades in ENG 5083.50 yesterday as well, so I now officially know where I stand on that. I received 185 out of a possible 200 points on the portfolio and got an A in the course. I am *very* pleased with myself over that, boyz n grrls, because Bibliographic Research Methods is considered a challenging course even if you're a grad student in English. (Which I'm not.) I kept pace with a roomful of mostly PhD candidates, the majority of whom are less than half my age, *from my soft little bed*. Woo-hoo! Vi's got the Right Stuff as a gentleperson & a scholar. How 'bout that? 

Harry got his term paper with comments back from Dr. Krajewsky this morning. Dr. K didn't put a grade on it but we're assuming that it's an A, because it wasn't dripping red ink and the comments were largely restricted to ""misspelled"" and ""I would have said 'metaphorical process'"" (rather than 'level of metaphors'), plus the names of a few scholars Harry might want to read if he pursues the topic further at a later date. (We had to laugh because Dr. Krajewsky shamelessly plugged his own mentor about three times! ;->) 

For those of you who aren't local, we woke up to slippery roads (in places) and temperatures in the low 20s this morning. My nurse Rose was supposed to come draw blood for fasting labwork, but she called and rescehduled it till Thursday morning because she couldn't get into Denton safely. (She lives east of Denton, in Lewisville.) It's a good day to *be* a demizen of the Great Indoors, I'm here to tell you! At the moment, Harry's at the office, though, because he had to take the hard copies of some of his graded materials as a Freshman Comp instructor to the English department and because he has to talk to a Women's Studies student who isn't necessarily happy about how her efforts to remove her Incomplete from last Fall turned out.

I used Harry's absence to buy him some goodies from Isis Books for Yule. I like to get his Yule prezzies ordered while he's out, because my sweetie's one of those folks who can't pass a computer screen without looking at what's on it. Most of the time that's not a problem, but when I'm shopping for him it gets annoying!

Harry's going to make chili for us tonight. Not from scratch. From a Wick Fowler's kit. Homemade chili is one of my winter favorites, so I'm all pumped up over that. I wish the local grocers carried venison chili meat, but at least the beef chili meat's good this year. (Last year, it was a bit too far on the fatty side.) 

I'm currently reading Kate West's _The Real Witches' Coven_. She's a British high priestess I've been hearing about but hadn't read anything by until now. Her book's pretty good. I'd put it on a par with Amber K's _Coven Craft_, but it's not as good as Judy Harrow's book on covens IMO. I'm not sure *what* I'll kick to the top of the To Read stack after I've finished it. A novel perhaps. Or maybe Kathleen Weiler's book on feminist pedagogy that I bought with my birthday B&N gift card.

Limited ""flights"" are expected to resume later this week. My sweetie misses my watching DVDs with him in the living room. (Heh-heh!) I miss watching DVDs in the living room, too, so...

On that note, I'm out of here. I want to write one more email before lunch, and time's a-wastin'!

I haven't been in a particularly snarky or withdrawn mood lately, so I assume the force behind my absence has been finals week--when my students keep my inbox so busy I have zero inclination to do *anything* online. My apologies. I didn't intend to neglect my journal.

The end of the semester is almost at hand now. My students finished their final exams yesterday. Today I reviewed them, hand correcting computer grading errors (such as not counting ""class-action"" lawsuit as a correct answer when the key says ""class action"" lawsuit), determing which wrong answers deserve partial credit, and applying a curve. Tomorrow (and maybe Monday morning) I'll be adding extra-credit points to the grades of those prudent pers who played CYA by completing extra-credit assignments. Monday afternoon (by 5:00pm) the university wants my grades posted and my students will receive their Just Desserts (with a dollop of mercy). Another semester bites the dust!

Kristie, a supervisor for the company that will be doing my physical therapy, came by this afternoon to do my evaluation. She approved me for two appointments a week with a therpist named MaraH for the next six weeks, so--woohoo!--another resource has now been put in play on my behalf. The optimum goal is to get me back to being able to stand on one leg and pivot to get in and out of my wheelchair, but lesser goals include not losing any more use of my large muscles (which I'd begun to from being bedfast), regaining the ability to turn on my side, and getting some range of movement back in my left leg. Wish me luck?

This is short but I'm tired. I may be AWOL tomorrow and Monday, but by Tuesday I promise to get back with the program.

I hope each of you is having a great weekend.

I don't feel too great physically this morning. I slept badly due to sinus congestion/infection and woke up with my sinuses still majorly clogged. I took a decongestant after breakfast (my regular daily dose), so hopefully it will be kicking in soon. At the moment, the area around my eyes still feels about ten times bigger than it ought to, though. Ah, the joys! At least there's no blood when I blow my nose today. (Unlike on Friday & Saturday!)

This is Monday so I'll be grading Discussion Board forums when I leave here. Currently Section 54's Week 14 postings are up. (I finished Section 55's Week 14 stuff yesterday morning.) This being the last week of the semester, I get to grade a second set of postings (for Week 15) when I'm done. (Whoopee!) Then I'm done with everything except reviewing their final exams, adding in their extra-credit points, and posting their course grades by 5:00pm next Monday (December 15th). 

Will I get to forget about WS 2013 when the grades are posted? Hell, no! I'll get to prepare the syllabuses to teach it again in Spring 2009. Does that really cheese me off that badly? Not really. I would like a few more days with nada to do than I'm actually going to get, but--despite my frequent kvetching--I like teaching, and a big part of online teaching is having it planned and in the BlackBoard shells *before* the semester starts.

Oh, we do have a new teaching-related nuisance when teaching WS 2013, come Spring 2009. We have to give a pre-test two weeks into the semester to determine what our students' baseline knowledge of Women's Studies is and a post-test the week before finals to see what it's become, for research purposes. (The students are going to *love* taking a test the week before finals. Not!) In principle, I'm okay with this but here's the clog in the works: The students are required to take the two tests, *but* the students can't be penalized for *not* taking them. (Due to current standards for research involving human participants. You see, the test is being given as part of ongoing research--*not* as part of measuring what they've learned for their course grades. And students as involuntary research participants is no longer an option.) That oughta be fun! (*So* not.) Most of our students don't want to do *anything* unless it's going to affect their grades. Oh, well! I'll think of something, I'm sure.

As I've said before, I'm through playing grad student for the semester. Harry's still got two hefty wrap-ups this week, though. (Poor baby!) He needs to turn in a term paper to Dr. Krajewski on Wednesday, and he has to take a final for Dr. Palmer on Thursday. (All while getting 42 portfolios graded by next Monday as a Freshman Comp instructor.) Should be fun! He's praying for 36 hour days and the energy to use them, but I suspect the first half at least is impossible. (Joshua and Klaatu are both unavailable to advise him on how to make the Earth stand still! ;->)

I guess I've rambled on enough. So...hasta la bye-bye and I'll be back to check up on you guys later.

Am I entirely satisfied with my work? No, of course not. But I am pleased with it. I did reasonably well (all things considered), I learned a lot along the way (both about the subject matter of the course and about myself), and I gave it my best shot. To me, that epitomizes a good academic experience. I was dead tired when I finished the sucker, but I've slept twice since so life is good! :-)

Earlier in the day on Thursday my home healthcare nurse, Rose, paid her first visit. (She'll be coming out once a week for eight weeks, and Dr. Anbarasu can order more visits in 2009 if any are needed.) Rose is okay. She's conacting Dr. Anbarasu's office before her next visit because they haven't ever sent her any lab orders for my blood work, and she's also requesting orders to give me a flu shot and get me some physical therapy. Did you ""hear"" that? Physical therapy. Now we're getting someplace! She checked my vital signs, asked how I was doing, and all the usually nursely stuff. She's also trying to persuade me to talk to a social worker to determine what insurance or government-sponsored benefits I might be entitled to that I haven't applied for. Dunno about *that*! Social workers makes our skin crawl, Precious. Wicked, nosy, trouble-making meddlerses! (Harry would like for me to at least hear them out, though, because there are some things I need we can't get out of pocket--e.g., an accessible apartment, a motorized chair, and a PCA for when I want to go forth in the world and he has work or school that I really *might* be entitled to. So...I'm thinking. Very slowly, but thinking.) The game plan is to keep me out of any nursing homes *and* from swilling any hemlock cocktails. Which game plan I'm in favor of actually!

Yesterday I finished constructing my Final Exam and launched it around 11:30pm. I'd hoped for 9:00pm, but BlackBoard was being fey. It kicked out around haf my questions the first time I entered them, so I had to re-enter them, sometimes more than once. It's safely in use now, though, and one bave soul has already taken it. She got an 80.

Harry has his students' portfolios to grade this weekend--and on into next week, so no parties, movies, etc., anytime soon. It's nose-to-the-grindstone time. I've told him I'll help him with them, insofar as I ethically can. (I can't give any of his students a grade, because I'm not their instructor of record. However, I can look at their work and, knowing the criteria, recommend a grade.) So...now you know how Vi plans to spend her weekend. Well, that and grading my own students' next-to-last assignment and reading for plaisir! (Let's hear it for plaisir, eh? ;->)

The Amazon got my copy of _Tales of Beedle the Bard_ to my via Oops (UPS) on Thursday. I really, really like it! Of course, I've been a fairy tale and folk tale nerd since before I could read--and I started reading at three. It's a fun little volume that contains five stories that wizarding folk tell their children, translated from an ancient manuscript by Hermione Granger and annotated by Albus Dumbledore (possibly just for his own use, although if so he talks to himself a lot!). Oh, yeah: and with footnotes for Muggles by J.K. Rowling. (Mary GrandPre did the cover art, too.) Two of the stories read like literary fairy tales, a bit too sweet and self-consciously moralizing; the other three--""The Fountain of Fair Fortune,"" ""The Warlock's Hairy Heart,"" and a variant on ""The Three Brothers"" (which she used in HP7)--have the feel of actual folk tales. Those three are my favorites, naturally! When I pre-ordered the book, I was a bit unhappy with the $12.99 price, but the proceeds are going to a children's charity Rowling co-founded so I got over myself. If you know any HP *or* fairy tale fans (young or old), I recommend it for them highly.

Pat_gund, I read Forrest J. Ackerman's obit on Yahoo just before coming to lj. Apparently he really *has* passed on this time.

That leaves me feeling very sad, because I enjoyed his efforts on behalf of the genre and read his magazines when I was a sweet young thing who went to sci-fi cons. Fandom won't be the same without him.

Angelique, the Anna Franklin book arrived on Thursday and I got to look it over. As I said its actually for teenagers, but I think the MU's up for it--especially if she remembers why Goddess whispered into Noah Webster's ear! ;-> BTW, the title was _Real Wicca for Young People_ in Amazon's listings, but on the book it says _for Teens_. Oh, well! I don't think she'll mind the promotion. Just tell her Auntie Vi says she doesn't get her official teen privileges until she actual ships the old One-Three. (And then they're the ones you say she can have.) The loot for you and Paul is supposed to come from Magical Omaha on Monday, so perhaps a visit next weekend is in order?

Wooly, welcome home! I've forgotten: Do you have any more goings-forth before the holly daze? I hope not! BTW, don't forget you owe me a list--and Mama Bear owes me two more items. :-)

Becca and Engelshai, I hope each of you is having a great weekend. Tell me about it on Monday, eh? I love to have news of you both. 

For now, that's it! I love each and every one of you and wish you a wonderful Saturday and Sunday, wherever you may be in them at the moment. (It's Saturday at 4:45 here.)

Until next time,
Vi

Harry hurt his back and hip last Wednesday, so I haven't been able to fly out to the livingroom for movies lately. He went to see Dr. Menard yesterday. She ruled out really icky possibilities but told him to take it easy till he heals. (Mostly his hip and upper leg are bothering him, along the path that sciatica traces.) That translates to ""I'm stuck in my bed again, dammit!"" Not a happy making proposition, admittedly--but it's better than encouraging my sweetie to play Superman so that he *really* hurts something orthopedicaly speaking. Ah, well! Waiting is. I'm sure you'll be the first to know when I'm up and at 'em again.

I'm a busy child today. I need to finish grading Week 13 Discussion Board forum postings (I have three from Section 54 and all of Section 55 to go) and I also need to be working on my portfolio, which is due at noon on Friday (December 5th). If after today I don't post for a day or two, please think nothing of it. When I get back, I'll be largely free till the day after the MLK holiday. (I won't have anything else to do as a student, but I'll have a bit more to do as a instructor.) C'mon, ""holly daze""!

Harry's pretty busy, too. He went to his last History of Rhetoric II course last night, but this morning he worked frantically on his Nietzsche paper for Dr. Krajewski, which is due next Wednesday. This afternoon he's holding his final office hours of the semester, which includes letting some young ladies from his Composition class do the in-class compositions that they missed last week by takig off forThanksgiving early. Thursday night he'll go to his final Restoration and 18th-Century Drama class, but a week later he has to go back to take Dr. Palmer'sfinal in it. And, of cours, he's got all of his end-of-the-semester work as an nstructor to get done, too.

I've got a wicked intermitten headache today. It must be my sinuses again, which feel like someone's packed each one with a large, sharp object. Most days my claritan clone is effective, but not today.

Not much said, I know, but I think I'd best call it quits. My students need my attention more than my lj does at the moment.

I hope each of you is having a very fine day, wherever in it you may be.

"event","This is the last Sunday of the semester for me as a student, although I'll be active one Sunday after that as an instructor. How does it feel to have almost finished my journey as a ""scholar of Fall 2008"" with Dr. Burns? Pretty *darned* good! It was fun to do something off the beaten path and to learn new skills as a researcher and practice others that had gotten rusty. In fact, it's been a good enough experience that I actually look forward to taking Information Retrieval Methods next semester, which I had originally signed up for just because I needed six semester hours and online pickings were slim. (That reminds me, Wooly: I still need that book review! If it seems like it might be helpful for my Spring course, I'll order it from amazon.com and read it over Winter break.)

I just order Harry's first Yule gift. I can't remember if I've told you guys or not, but he's very into Nietzsche. Anyhow, as you know  (to the point of boredom, I'm sure), I've been reading bits of Derrida and secondary Derrida scholarship as affects my field all semester. Well, as I was cruising the Derrida books online for the hooptieth time this morning, I discovered the subtitle of _Spurs_ is _On Nietzsche's Style_. Looking further, I also discovered the book's the source of an article on Nietzsche that Harry really liked reading for Dr. Krajewski's class. So...I ordered it for him. I dunno if it will arrive in time for him to use in writing his term paper for Dr. K, but he'll enjoy reading it whenever he can, I'm sure! :-)

We're doing a Hannah's brunch today. (It's been a few weeks, so we're due.) I think I may finally have the steak Florentine breakfast. Besides a piece of flatiron steak, spinach, and Florentine sauce, it consists of friend eggs, fried green tomatoes, and a sauteed mushroom medley. That, their breakfast bread, and some coffee sounds mighty good!

I haven't ""flown"" again since Thanksgiving. Harry's right hip and leg are bothering him, and using a manual lift to get me in and out of bed is a bit of a strain on him. That's why I've scratched my flights. We're going to try to get him an appointment with Dr. Menard at Student Health Services tomorrow to see if she can do anything to identify the source of and relieve his pain. I'd appreciate your prayers, positive thoughts, candle burning, or whatever for him, because he's not a complainer when it comes to pain but he's been complaining for three days now. I *know* it must hurt like a son of a bitch!

(And hopefully both he'll feel better and regularly scheduled flights will resume soon!)

I found out yesterday that my GA lost a friend during the killings in Mumbai last week. The woman was at the Taj Mahal Hotel for a wedding when the terrorists invaded it. Deepti is deeply distressed, not only because of her friend's death but because Mumbai is, as she says, her city--the place she loves best in the world--and simply because she's Indian by birth (although recently naturalized as an American citizen) and suffering with her fellow Indians as we all suffered through 9/11. I hope her grief is as manageable as grief can be, which is never all *that* manageable!

I have a slow day planned, at least until Dr. Burns sends me my Project IV with his comments. Depending on how much revision it requires, my evening may be a bit frantic. I made 94, 92, and 92 on the three previous projects, though, so I'm hopeful this one won't be too hairy to rewrite either.

I'd better close. Harry's curently out shopping, but he'll be home soon and need this computer to work on his students' papers. (He normally uses our other 'puter, but due to the hip pain, he can't sit in his office chair comfortably and has been borrowing my computer and bed table to use.) I'll be checking back later to see what you're up to, but this is all from me for now.

Have a great day and a great end to your weekend. I love you guys very much!

"event","Okay. This is my ""official"" posting of the day. I don't know if it will be any newsier than the 7:30am I Survived My Turkey Day Dining posting, but at least it will cover more territory. It's been a slow day. (The day after Thanksgiving usually is, but that's okay. Slow is a good thing, every now and when, IMO. ;->)

As I said, we got up around 7:30. After breakfast, Harry graded some papers and I noodled around on the Net a bit. I mostly played word games, but I also--finally--managed to reply to Engelshai's email. (Boy, was I getting embarrassed about how long it had taken me to do that!) Harry & I constructed the list for our weekly major grocery run. (We lay in most of what we need every Friday and get things we've forgotten or run out of and additional fresah produce as needed during the week.) He left for Krogers around 10:30 and returned with groceries, a tankful of of gasoline (for under $20 for the first time in awhile!), and burgers from Fuddruckers around 12:30. (I adore Fudd's buffalo burger with grilled onions. Big yum!) That pretty much describes my morning.

I spent my afternoon alternately reading the rest of _Rereading the Sophists_ and napping. I was very happy with Jarratt's book, which I finished just before Harry served supper around 6:30. We had panbroiled trout fillets, fingerling potatoes, and steamed cabbage seasoned with fried bacon. We finally broke into that sugarfree pumpkin pie for dessert, too. 'Twas good--very good. Now I'm drinking after-dinner coffee and posting to my lj.

Harry just put a load of laundry (cold wash) into our aparatments' one washing machine and is getting ready to kick off his party. (Terry will join him later. They plan to play chess and/or throw darts and drink a couple of rounds.) I'll stay online awhile longer and then read something that isn't easily disrupted by rock-n-roll and men laughing. (Not Derrida, for sure! ;->) I plan to have another eggnog with Tully before I sleep. (It takes us a few days to go through a carton of eggnog, because there are only two of us and I can only have one cup per day. Harry *chooses* to only have one cup per day because of eggnog's richness.)

I bought Harry a shot glass with a unicursal hexagram (in pewter) on it earlier in the week and it arrived today. It's a pretty thing. I got it for him because he likes unusual/collectible shot glasses and because of our ties to the O.T.O. The postman brought a book I bought him earlier in the week as well. I'm drawing a blank on its title *blush*, but it just won the National Book Award for fiction. The author's name is Matthiessen, and the book is a single-volume retelling of a trilogy of his previously published. (He had wanted to write a single novel all along, but his publisher insisted on the trilogy format at the time because of the length of the work.) The author (and the critics) are happier with this one-volume version, which is something in excess of 400 pages shorter than the three novels' combined length. (Sounds like that publisher was a tad impatient, doesn't it?)

Tomorrow I'll start revising the materials that will go into my ""scholar's portfolio"" for Dr. Burns. Of the three projects I've already gotten back, none of them require major overhauls--and he promises to return Project IV with comments on Sunday. Besides revising the four projects, I need to write a table of contents and an intoduction, select some of my Discussion Board forum postings for inclusion, and decide what kind/degree of an index I need and create it. The final portfolio is due next Friday, December 5th at noon. Wish me luck? (And skill?)

That's all the news that's fit and I'm not waxing philosophical tonight. (Maybe because I read a bit too much about Sophist, Platonic, and Aristotlean philosophies this afternoon!) I continue to hope that your weekend is proving enjoyable. Whether it's still Friday or already Saturday where you are, be happy, my friends!

"event","Well, Turkey Day has come and gone. As promised, Vi was a cautious, mindful diabetic on the day of the feast. So...what's the score? At none of the regularly scheduled times when I checked my blood sugar yesterday was my blood sugar outrageously high. It got to 171 (a big two clicks outside my target range) when I took it in the evening, with the main meal of the day already behind me. (I had added some mulled non-alcoholic cider to the big meal and substituted sugarfree cheesecake bites for my pumpkin pie, which would have been much higher in carbs due to the crust.) I had eggnog with a half shot of Tully as planned at bedtime. What was my overnight blood sugar? Eighty-four (six clicks *below* my target range). We have proven yet again that judicious planned indulgences *do* work. Yay!

I hope everyone's day is off to a good start or progressing nicely, as th case may be.

"event","To those of you who are celebrating Thanksgiving today, Happy Turkey (or Tofurkey) Day! (Yes, some of my friends *are* vegetarians. So? And others, like me, are merry little omnivores. Again, so?)

I didn't post yesterday because I was running behind--all day long. First, we overslept. Then my visiting nurse ran two and a half hours late because her company added on an emergency appointment for her at 9:00am. Then lunch took forever to get on the table, despite consisting of leftovers. Then commenting on and grading Section 54's Week 12 Discussion Board forum postings took twice as long as it normally does. And the beat went on, and on, and on! Today's a better day. We got up 15 minutes early and I've stayed on track. (Of course, it helps that my holiday schedules aren't exactly grueling! ;->)

I started a new book last night: Susan C. Jarratt's _Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured_. (I'm reading it while still reading _Anam Cara_, but reading two books at once is nothing unusual for me.) I first discovered Jarratt in Dr. Burns's Bibliographic Research Methods course. She's both a professor of English and active in women's studies. I like her style, which is challenging but not obscure like--oh, say--Judith Butler! This book is very interesting, because she's demonstrating that Plato's and Aristotle's views of the Sophists aren't the only possible views and that attempting to understand the Sophists in terms of their own writings (fragmentary as those are) gives us a way out of the oppositional binary that (over)values philosophy and science and (under)values rhetoric and literature. 

What are you having by way of good eats this Thanksgiving? We're doing mixed fancy stuffed olives and mixed slices of cheese for an appetizer and having duckling a l'orange, cornbread dressing with giblet gravy, steamed asparagus, and cranberry sauce for the main course, with sugarfree pumpkin pie for dessert. (And, yes, Lique, I *will* be keeping track of my total carbs today!) We'll have miscellaneous leftovers for the evening meal and lite eggnog with Tully for a nightcap. It's all holiday fare but not *too* far from innocence. And the only thing I'll really miss is candied yams with pineapple and chopped walnuts. (Some years we fake it with acorn squash with a pseudo brown sugar glaze, pineapple in its own juice and chopped walnuts. I wanted dressing this year more, though!)

Cheryl Marco, the home healthcare nurse is both very nice and very professional. Unfortunately, she won't be my regular visiting nurse, because she's a supervisory/managerial per. She says I'll probably like my assigned nurse, though, because that woman is very laid back and informative as well. She's probably right because all I ask of medical and paramedical personnel is that they treat me with respect and provide me with enough info to make good medical decisions. She offered to have an aide come in for respite care once or twice a week, but Harry declined. So far he's not feeling the need for Caregiver's Day Out. (I disagree but he's a big boy, so it's his call.) Cheryl was satisfied that Harry's providing good care for me. (D'uh!) I'm pretty happy to have someone to make a housecall when I can't get in to see my doctor. I'd never told myself so, but it was pretty scary not to have that form of protection. *Vi smiles with happy relief*

BlackBoard posted the shells for my two Spring women's studies classes yesterday. So far enrollment is around 25 per section, but--trust me!--by mid-January when classes resume, they'll be up around 40. Deepti is going to be my GA again, which is very, very peachy by me! (She's my best GA ever.) BTW, I've decided to talk to Dr. Doddy about the possibility of teaching freshman comp online. I have enough hours in graduate English, but I don't have two particular courses that their GTAs and adjuncts normally have (and am not sure I can get them online). This is by way of planning a fall-back in case my degree in family therapy gets held up due to my mobility problems. The women's studies program doesn't use adjuncts--just GTAs. If I run out of online courses I can take, I'll have to get an adjnct gig because GTAs have to be taking a minimum of 6 semester hours per semester. The English department hires *beaucoup* adjuncts. So... (Can you guys picture me teaching Freshman Comp? *LOL!* I promise I won't be a grammarnazi. I'm a genuine grammarnerd, but I don't expect everyone *else* to be!)

Ooh, ooh! Small but pleasing excitement: _Burn After Readng_ is coming out on DVD on December 21st. (Remember how dismayed I was not to be able to see it at the local theatres?) Guess whose sweetie sez he'll get it for her as a Yule prezzie. Yay!

On that thought, goodbye for now. I feel a nap attack coming on--on schedule.

Have an excellent day and know I'll be thinking of you throughout the day!

"event","Why am I so late posting today? Because I made a Bad Dietary Decision at breakfast and have been running rough ever since. As some of you know, I can occasionally eat Foods That Are Bad for Diabetics (read: sweets). This morning my blood sugar was looking good (90) when I woke up, so I asked Harry did he want to make a donut run. He was (not surprisingly) all for it. My first mistake was that I had him go to a different donut shop from the one we usually buy from, because he'd been waiting to try their wares. The new shop's wares are somewhat sweeter and a great deal oilier than our old standby's. So...I get too much of the wrong stuff in me. My second mistake was that I forgot to take my morning meds, which include Actos and Glucotrol ER to help me keep my blood sugar under control. Around mid-morning, I realized I didn't feel so good but I chalked it up to, ""Damn, those donuts were oily!"" (I was belching oily donut taste, so it seemed a logical and sufficient reason to feel bilious and blah.) At lunch time when I took my blood sugar, it was 238 and we realized I'd forgotten my morning meds. I took 'em but I was too nauseated to have something carb heavy to tide me over till supper. Hary went to the university for his office hours and I mostly napped. When he got home at 5:00pm, my blood sugar was back in the realms of sanity (131). We had an uneventful Thai supper from Thai Ocha, which actually tasted good to me. (I used my brains and ate the recommend amount of rice for a diabetic with my curry.) Now I'm up and at 'em. Finally. Moral of my story: When doing the occasional, permissible Bad, be mindful of what's happening. I should've stopped midway through my glazed donut and said, ""This doesn't agree with me. Would you mind boiling me an egg or something?"" I also should have confirmed that I'd taken my pills. (""Uh, honey, would you look at my pill box and see if I took the morning handful?"") It's tedious being good sometimes--even reasonably good as opposed to perfectly good. It's also worth the effort. (BTW, just in case any of you don't know, 238 isn't dangerously high, go see the nice doc in the emergency room. It's headache or torpor time and a reminder to be mindful. It's just embarrassing/annoying to know better and be so mindless anyhow!)

Tomorrow my home health nurse Cheryl will be out to induct me into the joys of her companys services. She sounds like a nice per on the phone. I'm sure I'll let you know how it goes Right Here at LJ.

Have a lovely evening, sweet dreams, a great Wednesday, or whatever else applies when you read this.

"event","It's Monday afternoon already. I kept Monday morning kind of busy. I got Dr. Anbarasu's office to call in my latest batch of maintenance meds, set up an intake appointment (for Wednesday morning) with my brand new visiting nurse per, commented on and graded half of Section 55's Week 12 Biscussion Board forum postings, and answered some quick emails. (Engelshai, I have your email but it may be a day or two before I have enough time to give it the reply it deserves. It's wonderful to be back in touch with you, though. Thanks!) I just finished lunch and, after I post here, I'm going to snag a nap before it's time to tackle the tasks of late afternon and evening on a Monday.

I didn't take a repeat ""flight"" in my transfer lift yesterday, because I wound up busy writing a small paper for Dr. Burns last night. (In and of itself, it didn't take that long, but getting *ready* to write it was more time consuming than I expected.) Since Harry's got an evening class and I've got office hours this evening, I may pass on going forth to watch a DVD tonight, too, but tomorrow when Harry gets home from his office hours we'll be on holiday time till Monday--I'll bet I come forth to watch DVDs *every* night then. (Nothing like making up for lost time!) 

Becca, I thought I would crack up reading your posting this morning! It sounds like the series you contracted to read is what Harry calls ""pretty heavily formulaic."" I feel for you because what I love best in novels is their holding some surprises for me. Toni Morrison's new novel _A Mercy_ that I read over the weekend was very good in that respect, but then she's a Nobel laureate,isn't she? I think in the case of the deal you made with your friend that she *definitely* got the better end of the deal! (Of course, she might not realize that since she recced the series you're reading.) 

Patrick, thanks for posting the opening segment of the first _Dr. Who_ episode over the weekend. I enjoyed watching it, although I'm not a major ""Who-nik."" (I've seen all of the Tom Baker episodes and a few of the others here and there.) The clip was mostly astounding as a specimen of 1960s broadcasting. Most days I don't give the 60s much thought, but...well, they're almost like another world now, aren't they? Watching the launch of the doctor was fun!

Wooly, you and Mama Bear need to send me those lists! I promise that you *will* get something you want out of it. (In that respect, friends tend to be better behaved than family, don't we?)

Drowsiness is startig to get the best of me. I slept badly last night (courtesy of achey joints and leg cramps) and my tummy is comfortably full of lunch from Cracker Barrel at the moment. Trust me on this: I'm currently better equipped to snore than to keyboard! Maybe  I can post more this evening. I'll *definitely* be back to read other people's postings, regardless.

Have a great Monday, wherever in Monday you currently find yourselves!

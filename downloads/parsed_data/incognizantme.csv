"event","well.. i was trying to be brave and allow my feelings for a certain someone to be known... and well i sent an e-mail... because i dont have enough guts to establish the real rejection of face to face... and well... here is what happened... (names removed to disclose identity... although it might be obvious...)


I know its kind of weird for me to be writing you an e-mail since we see each other almost everyday, and we send each other messages on myspace and whatnot, but I just wanted to e-mail you... because I wanted to get something out... 
Anyway- I know you probably already might have known this, but I have kind of liked you for a long time... off and on since my freshman year of college. I know you are probably thinking, why is she telling me now... well because I still do like you. I know this may even come to a surprise to you since we have been such good friends... but I just really felt like i should just get it out so that you would know. I really hope that you and i can still be friends and that nothing will be weird between us... I would hate to ruin our friendship. I know you have had to deal with 
telling people how you feel, and then having it turn badly for you, and i didn't really want that to happen, so i figured the easiest way would be through e-mail... i guess i am just afraid to face reality... because i know that we are just friends... nothing more, and that we probably would never be anything more... but I just needed to get it out in the open, so that you know how i have been feeling... anyway- please e-mail me back and let me know what you think... or if its too weird, just pretend that i never sent this e-mail and i will do my best to do the same.  :-) Later- 
Nickie 
 


Hey Nickie, 

Well I wouldn't say I have known but I have had my thoughts about that. Its ok that you send an email, I know it is really hard. I really cherish our friendship and I want that to last forever. I dont see us being anything more though. You are an awesome girl, dont forget that. I know its cliche but someday your prince will come. If you ever feel lonely or like you will never find teh right one, i know I do sometimes, just look to God and He will carry you through. Have an awesome time with your parents and I will see you when we get back. 


SO... i guess it wasn't like horribly horrible... and the fact that i am awesome... yeah... its true... and oddly enough... i dont really feel to badly about this whole ordeal... I put myself out there... i was really nervous... and then i read the reply.. i was sad for like 2 seconds... but then i was like... that was really kinda gay nickie... lol... so i guess i will just have to keep searching for my prince charming... or... eh... just give up completely... and then maybe He will just come and sweep me off my feet.... because i wont care about it all... let's see how long this no guy thing lasts though... :-p later

I have been in the house pretty much all day, but I think we might go exploring around town a little bit tomorrow. I hear that there are some Christian bookstores here, and so I am pretty excited to see what kind of stuff they have... there is a christian clothes store... never heard of that before, but i am excited to see what it is and what kind of clothes they have... lol 

Umm... the drive was pretty un-eventful... I am glad to be here though and ready to relax... mmmm.. yeah... well later!

I really miss them a lot... and I really just dont want to be here in Mac today... but no one is really doing anything... so here i sit in the hearthroom doing nothing... as always. its kind of funny because all these ladies form this quilting group came here to the button hole from NE and now, finally, they are leaving....  i bet i will be like that someday when I am old... being in a quilting group traveling from state to state visiting the quilt shops.... lol.... thats just funny. i had the weirdest dream last night... i think it was because i watched some of king kong... but i had this dream that these people were chasing me around trying to shoot me with machine guns... it was weird, i was hiding up close to these buildings and then there was this lady who was trying to shoot me too, but then she decided to help me and we shot this guy... and the bullets would kind of like bounce off, but he died.... so it was weird... and then i was in this nursery type thing putting books on the shelf and THEN it changed and me and Sarah D and someone else were dancing in this alley way and there were these guys who came and were watching us, and these slutty girls were watching too... and they had no shirts or bras on, and we were like you cant dance here unless you have clothes on.... it was weird... then i was all sweaty and hot and this guy came and was talking to me and was like walking with me and he asked me to go with him in this room and he told me i could play with his penis if i wanted to.... i was like ok... and then i woke up... WEIRD... why do i dream things like that.... its just strange... but anyway- umm... yeah... i am done now... maybe i will go  find somehting else to do while we sit here... so Later

"event","so this week has been actually really good... and yet, its like I am still kinda feeling blah at the moment. I dont know what it is, something just makes me think that i have to make sure that everyone else is ok... that everyone is in a good mood... and if they are not, then i feel like i am a failure... like i am not a good friend. why do i feel like that? its not my problem if someone is having a bad day... is it? i didnt do anything to make that person feel badly... or did I? Maybe I am just paranoid... I dont know... anyway... hanging out with kt and sarah c. has been a lot of fun. we havent really been doing much, just hanging out and stuff, just playng croquet and stuff and laughing and having fun with each other and enjoying each others company and just trying to make the best of living in our house with the drinkers.... lol... anyway- guess we are going camping tonight. that should be fun. I dont actually know who all is going, but i think its probably steve, sarah d. paul and I... so it should be a good time. its times like this when i just really wish my parents were in OK right now... so i could just go home for the weekend and not have to do anything or have to really deal with anyone... thats whats gonna be nice when they are there... running away yet again. I think thats something I am good at. eh... i have been reading my bible and doing devotions everynight, and its been good. I have been learning a lot from reading from the old testament. it makes me happy to know that I really do have the discipline to fight temptation when it comes and stay strong in doing what i know is right. glad it has finally decided to make itself evident... at least in reading my bible anyway. dave, is so weird sometimes... i get this feeling that he is all flirty with me, and of course i like that attention, even though its from him... and then the next breath its like he is flirting with KT again... it makes me wonder if a guy will ever truly like me... of if i will always just be the naive one who will just go along with whatever because I can't see what is going on right in front of me... maybe i am not as stupid as i seem though... i know.... anyway- I think i am done with this blog for now... dont really get to check the internet as much as i used to, but i think thats ok too... when i do get on, i should write... like now... lol... anyway- later

I dont know.. hmm.. anyway i am getting kinda sleepy, and needing some more drugs.... mmm... drugs! lol... i kinda wish school were starting up again soon just so that... no i take that back... its gonna be so weird when school starts.. anyway- talked to my parents and they will be moving into the new place in OK around June 24.. so thats cool.

"event","so today is my last day in the dorm until August... although I am excited for this new ""adventure"" i am a bit nervous... there are just so many things that make me freak out a little bit... the biggest issue is money. As everyone knows... I am not a saver. when i have money, I usually spend it... and thats not good when I have rent and food to buy this summer. Hopefully I will learn to be frugle... The other issue that I am a bit nervous about is the fact that I will be living with some of my closest friends... these people are ones that I would never want to hurt intentionally.. and I am afraid that being this close to them over a 3 month period might just make us want to kill each other... or it could be super great and we all just get along as normal... The other factor is the whole fact that there are 4 OTHER girls living in the house besides sarah D, sarah c KT and I... that might get a little crazy at times... I know it will all work out... its just stuff that keeps popping into my head... anyway- everything is sitting in the hallway ready to go... first we are going to church, then its moving time... woo hoo... eh... just kidding... i hate moving soooo much :-("

I am not PMSing or anything, so I dont know what my problem is. so i think that if i were to get a labotomy... maybe it would be better.. i might be paralyzed and might drool all over myself or something, but it might be better than thinking the crap i think, and feeling the crap i feel... oh well...
Today has been a good day though... no sensitive moments... or at least none that made me feel sad. i saw an old friend today... John-Micheal Watson... he is back from Israel... and I talked to him for a few minutes... it was really kind of awkward, but it was nice to talk to him too. anyway- umm what else... oh i have a huge praise... i have like $400 credit money i can go pick up tomorrow from my tuition... that is such a blessing! i am like down to no money, and i dont get paid again until the 30th.. and with this money, i am guaranteed rent money for the summer... so thats awesome. anyway- here is a song that i have been thinking about lately... i think that JEW wrote it for me... so here it is... later

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out or
looked down on.
Just try your best, try everything you can.
And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away.

Chorus
It just takes some time, 
little girl you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine, everything,
everything will be alright, alright.

Hey, you know they're all the same.
You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in.
Live right now.
Yeah, just be yourself.
It doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else.

Chorus
It just takes some time, 
little girl you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine, everything,
everything will be alright, alright.
It just takes some time, 
little girl you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine, everything,
everything will be alright, alright.

Hey, don't write yourself off yet.
It's only in your head you feel left out or
looked down on.
Just do your best (do your best), do everything you can (everything you can).
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts (bitter hearts) are gonna say.

Chorus
It just takes some time, 
little girl you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine, everything,
everything will be alright, alright.
It just takes some time, 
little girl you're in the middle of the ride.
Everything, everything will be just fine, everything,
everything will be alright."

"event","so Oklahoma was fun. I really enjoyed spending the EAARLY morning with Steve... he is a fun guy. so here is what happened on my little escursion... (i think thats spelled wrong)

We left McPherson around like 6pm ish, and got into Oklahoma City around like... 10:30 or so. we met Brian, Dave's friend, and then we had to go to bed, because Dave's surgery was at like 5:30am... yeah, we had to wake up at 4:30... on a Thursday morning! That is my sleep in day... so that was a bummer, but it was ok, because oddly enough i wasn't tired... until like 6pm that night... anyway So we took dave to the hospital and then we decided to go site seeing... but since it was like 5am... nothing was really open... we went to the Oklahoma City bombing memorial thing, it was really impacting... like you hear about all this crap that happens, but you dont realize the depth of it until you are really there.... it was FREEZING cold there though... so we left and went to find something else to do... we found this little park that had a walking path along this little river and we walked around there a little bit. that was pretty fun... by this time it was still only like 6:30-7... so we went and got some breakfast at like the nicest mcdonalds i have ever been in... so that was cool... after that we drove around a little more and then we found this lake that was something Steve had in mind to go see, but we found it on accident... so we threw some rocks in the lake and stuff... and then we decided to go to Wal-mart until other things opened... we were there for like 30-45 minutes... maybe an hour, and then the hospital called, and we had to go get Dave... then we sat at the hospital for like an hour or so learning about how to care for Dave... he was so drugged up... it was funny. we then went to this sports store and then to lunch... after that we went to old navy and then to bass pro shop... got some pictures with Mr. Grizzly and Spirit the fox... hahaha... umm then we were on our way home, and thats when i got freakin exhausted! we got back to Mac around 7... and i took a nap until 9. yeah... so that was pretty much my past weekend so far.. its not over yet though... its only just begun! YAY!"

I am soooooo excited too though, because I went to check my grade for my last test in biology, which was today, and I got a 90% on it! I haven't gotten a good grade like that in that class EVER! i was so happy! Anyway- I am gonna go to myspace, then its off to work for me... later!

I guess I am going on Wednesday to OK City with Dave and Steve. Dave is getting his 3rd knee surgery, and I guess Steve and I are going to hang out and look at the monuments and stuff. Like I told Sarah, I think it will either be really awkward, or it will be really fun. Dave is probably the only downfall.. but he will be all drugged up... so no worries. well, I think I am gonna go read and hang out in my bed... I am really sleepy today for some reason...

"event","Today has been a good day. I didnt accomplish anything in the way of homework, but its alright. I am not too worried. I am sitting here, and its storming.... again. It feels like it has rained for a long time here in good ol Kansas... but I was just realizing just how big God is, because of this storm. I think I sometimes, a lot of times actually, take for granted just how Big He is... He makes the thunder crack and the lightening strike, and I worry about silly stuff like boys all the time. God is so much bigger than boys, and grades and money and life. I wish i could remember that on daily basis...

Yesterday I realized that I needed to do something about not reading my bible... so i started reading from my one year bible again... and today, I actually read too. So 2 days so far! I am pretty excited. I remember Mrs. Wolcott telling us one time that a habit is formed after 14 day of continually doing something... so I want reading through the bible to become a habit. I mean... not just a mundane thing that i do, because I have to, but a habit that i do, because I want to read and learn. Like today for instance... the one year bible has a chapter from the old testament, and then the new testament... and well this chapter I am on is Judges. Maybe I am a bad Christian, or something, but I was reading and I just never knew that sex was blatently spoken about in the bible.... this dude goes to this town, and these nice people tell him and his concubine that he can stay with them... and these evil men come to the door and tell the guy to bring the vistor out so that they can have sex with him. I was kinda shocked! The guy said no, but he gave them his concubine... and then she died because they raped her and beat her... the guy then cut her up and spread her body throughout the 12 tribes.... kinda graphic I would say... I didnt know that stuff was in the bible... I want to learn more stuff like that... stuff that is so interesting, yet you never really hear about in church or sunday school...

Tomorrow is Friday, I am pretty excited about that. I think i really need an attitude adjustment though... I mean... life is going real good with my friends. That counseling session on monday has helped me to be more open and honest with Sarah D. and I think it has helped me feel good about our friendship... hope you feel the same way Sarah... and the whole guy thing.... like with sarah and paul... its awesome.... i dont even feel like jealous or anything anymore... so thats cool... i think its just like 3 people i need to just stop being attitudey towards... coco, elizabeth and hitomi... i seriously hope none of thsee people read this... but its ok... because honestly, its my journal, and i can vent if i need to... these people are super awesome great people, and i can say that i love them... but i just get this vibe when i am around them that just makes me want be mean towards them... and i dont know what it is... weird.... hmmm anyway- I think i am off to myspace... i didnt mean for this to turn into a novel... it just kinda did... ;-) later

But i have been riding bikes, and i think i really need to get a bike. I never really thought that so much physical excercise would be enjoyable... but we have gone bike riding tha past couple nights... well every other night, and I have to say, i really enjoy it... and its not like we have just ridden up the street and back, its been like 1-2 mile rides each time... so its exciting. anyway- I need to go read biology... so I should probably go.

Sarah, Paul, Steve, Coco and I went to Wichita and went to Coldstone, an ice-cream place... YUMMY! it was amazingly delicious! then we went to the dollar theatre and watched Madea's family reunion.. i liked it a lot. I kind of felt like a 5th wheel though... but its ok... I am trying not to let stupid stuff like that bother me... uhh... but it does a lot! DANG ME! lol... anyway- i feel accomplished, because I actually did homework tonight! WOO HOO! i was supposed to be reading a chapter and writing notes about it, and whtever, well, i hadn't so tonight, i kind of went through and wrote synopsises of a bunch of chapters...

"event","So... I am not sleepy really at all. i kinda was earlier, when we weren't doing anything, but now i am just kinda wide awake... crazy. today has been an emotional roller coaster kinda. it started off with SALT- Pauletta shared about rejection and how we compare ourselves so much to other people, and we shouldnt do that. we are chosen and loved by God, seperate, unique and super special INDIVIDUALS... we need to just kick satan in the balls and make him leave us alone! Well, I have been dealing with all that kinda crap lately, and so I kinda got teared up about that... then it was like the whole rest of the day every little thing just set me off into a mood of some sort. I HATE PMS!!!  I think its really hitting me that everything is changing next year. usually it is me that leaves, I have never had so many good friends leave ME, and not especially all at one time... I think its gonna be hard. I know it will be ok... it will make me have to step out and make new friends... maybe i am just afraid that everything will change... and that scares me... like these friends I have will all just forget about me and I wont matter... which is totally retarded... but thats just what my brain thinks... but anyway- i will be ok... no worries. I am strong.. change is pretty much my middle name, even though i dont like it so much... lol... anyway- off to myspace!"

kinda wish that i could have enough self-control and motivation to just go become a nun so that i wouldnt have to worry about wanting a boyfriend so much... i am sure that even nuns wish they were married and stuff though... so is anyone ever truly happy? we were talking about feminism yesterday in moden culture and chrisitianity, and that very subject was brought up... those who are all gung ho feminists, when they look back.. are they really happy with how their lives turned out? I think all women, innately wish that they were married and had children... unless they are just psycho... ok, i guess there are a select few that could care less, but... i dont know, thats just my personal view, which doesn't amount to much. hmmmm....

"event","so, today has been pretty much just a weird day... as i think i may have written about already, I felt really sick almost all day, and what do you know, its cuz i am a girl.

Speaking of which, i really wish i weren't. I am in a negative mood right now... and i needed to get it out so that i could go to sleep... so i decided the best way is to write. 

PLEASE DO NOT BE OFFENDED BY THE THINGS I SAY IN THIS POST! NOTHING I HAVE WRITTEN IN HERE IS ABOUT ANYONE- SO PEASE DO NOT TAKE WHAT I WRITE PERSONALLY! thank you!

I hate not knowing why i am feeling in certain ways. like i feel great about life and how it is going, and then one little thing triggers me to feel like a mess and not even know why i am all upset. no, i am not depressed... and i dont need freakin medication. i can handle these feelings myself... thats why i write. 

Anyway- the whole meaning for this post tonight is me wanting to be in a relationship. I am sure that this is a topic that gets so old... but this is my journal and if you dont want to read about it, then leave. I am venting... ok, thats my perogative... no one asks you to come read my stuff... you dont have to leave comments either because its not like they really help me feel better about myself or anything... when its in my head... I am the only one who can make it change... so on with the freakin post...

tonight after being all busy and crap, and having been in bed all day, i spent a little time with my friends. which usually is like super fun laughter friend time... and it was... playing cards and eating and stuff... thats what we do, and its fun... but i was also kinda just being a girl and wishing that i were in Sarah's shoes... having a guy like me. I know, why should i compare myself to Sarah... why do i compare myself to anyone? I dont know... its something i am trying to work on... but its hard. I just wish that for once a guy would like me... not be such a freakin guy...like me because i am ""hott""  but to like me for who i am, for the person that i truly am. I wish that guys could see me through my friends eyes. everyone says that i am so beautiful, that i am awesome and great... but why cant guys see that? why do i have to be sitting here even worrying about crap like that? its our freakin society... all guys are visual, and if you are not 100 pounds and have huge breasts, its almost as if guys just dont even acknowledge you exist. i am sick of it! I feel like i am falling for one of my good guy friends again... he is a great guy, has a super sense of humor and is a good Christian, pretty much a big teddy bear, but he is one that wont date a girl unless she is the above type girl... ok...maybe not so drastic, but still, it just sucks. what is wrong with girls like me that are larger? we have feelings too! we still want to know what its like to love and be loved... but its like since we dont weigh a certain amount, or look a certain way, then we are invisable, just little ugly ducklings that no one wants to take the chance to see what beautiful swans we really are... GRRR! Sarah and i were talking about this tonight, and she told me to not worry about it, that i have to be patient and that God is preparing my guy, and myself for the perfect time and all that stuff, and i want to beleive that it is true.... but what if it isn't?? I know that if we delight in the Lord, he will give us the desires of our hearts... and i know that our timing is not like His... and i KNOW all this stuff... but why is it soooo hard to put it into practice? to really understand it and just be ok with the way things are right now... why cant i just be happy being single? why cant i find happiness for my best friend when she is going on a date with an awesome guy? Why can't i just be ok with life the way it is now? why do i have to keep wishing there was more.. that there was someone who could make me happy? GOSH!!! I really wish that i could cry... i think thats what i need... a good long cry... its like the tears are trapped in there behind this bitterness... why am i bitter? I dont know... i think i feel a little bit better... and i really need to go to sleep... but here is a song that i want to make my prayer. All I need is to sit in Jesus's lap, to cuddle up close to Him and let him hold me and let me know that everything is going to be alright... everything is going to be alright nickie... everything will be alright... its gonna be alright........

Draw me close to You 
Never let me go 
I lay it all down again 
To hear You say that I'm Your friend 

You are my desire 
No one else will do 
Cause nothing else could take Your place 
To feel the warmth of Your embrace 

Help me find the way, bring me back to You 

You're all I want 
You're all I've ever needed 
You're all I want 
Help me know You are near"

Isn't it crazy though, how one person can ruin the whole evening? Yay for friends yes.... but why do some people let their negative feeling and attitudes ruin everyone elses night? I just dont get it. It kind of makes me mad. Makes me want to just know what causes people to be like that. Why do you think you are so much better than me, that your poop doesn't stink, and that you can just act like that, and not seem to care... people have feelings! gosh! anyway- 

AT walmart tonight we got some chips and salsa, cookies and pop, and we had a late night picnic. it was a lot of fun. while sarah and i were walking to get her contact solution, these guys were like, ""hey ladies"" and i was kinda nervous. They were like ""how are you tonight"" and i just looked over and scooted toward sarah and was like ""fine"" then they kept oogling us... and we were like paul.... steve.... paul.... steve! HELP! lol not really... it was kinda weird and yet like... cool, i guess, to have guys checking us out.... i bet they were drunk... lol...

after our picnic we went to the soccer field and we watched for shooting stars. I think i saw 3... God is so awesome in all of His creation... it makes you wonder how people DONT believe in Him, how people can blatantly reject him and go about their lives oblivious to all this magnificient stuff around them. Makes me love God super a lot! horrible grammar, but who cares! 

Lunch discussion with ""antonio"", sarah and KT was really thought provoking as well. I rather enjoyed it. Its not very often when you have intelligent conversations about God, which is so sad. we are in this christian bubble, and yet its like, we forget to share about God... to disciple those who need to know the truth. I am just as guilty. i would rather talk about guys and stuff, rather than talk about my awesome God. how pathetic!

"event","nothing really too exciting to write about. just kinda been hanging out with friends and stuff. I almost wish that i would have slept more today, but that was ruined by DANG DAVE knocking on the outer door wanting Sarah. GRRRR... oh well. i have avoided talking to him today... lets see if i can keep it up for the rest of this dang break. I am just so sick of him being so freakin selfish as to not even consider other peoples feelings. He can say and do whatever he wants if it benefits him, but if someone else hurts him... its horrible and you better say sorry... but when he hurts someone... no worries. its all just like been bothering me lately, and I should probably just forget about it, but its hard, because i have to be around him all the time. Oh well. I haven't really had time to think about being sorry for myself, which is always good. My friends have kept me pretty busy... just hanging out. I pretty much love my friends here. I guess it sucks because some of  the talk has been about Sarah and Paul, but its alright, i think its growing on me. I actually think they are going to be a super cute couple... if he ever gets the guts to ask her out. anyway- i need to go to sleep or something... gotta work in the dang cafeteria tomorrow. hopefully it will go by fast, because we are planning on going to Salina to ""On the Pot"" a pottery place, where you pick out the pottery you want to paint and you paint it... i am excited! Anyway- I am off... LATER!

"event","I am so fed up with one stupid person! he doesn't listen and he thinks he knows everything, and it pisses me off! i just want to SCREAM! I dont think i can handle it... so i am not going to hang out with him for a while to see if maybe an absence will make it better. he had the audacity last night to ask me if i could NOT hang out with Sarah today... i was just like are you freakin serious?!?!??! I wanted to just punch him. gosh... anyway- i have such a huge headache, and i cant sleep... 
BUT on a brighter note, i was informed today that tonight at 6:30pm I can go to this church where they have the family life center and see how that all works so that maybe this summer I can do my practicum there. I am pretty excited about that. Hopefully i can go... I am supposed to work, but i can always re-arrange my schedule. anyway- chorale in 10... later!

"event","there is just something about playing, and acting like a kid that just makes life all the more exciting and enjoyable!

Last night we went to Lindsborg to this really big and nice playground. It was like 12 something, and when we left it was like 2:15am. I am pretty much super tired today, but it was really fun just playing around on all the equipment. 

Picture this... Sarah, Shari, Paul and ME all crammed into Paul's little pick-up... all the way to Lindsborg. it was great fun. Sarah sat on my lap and Shari had to keep her feet on the dash so that Paul could shift. 

Pretty sure this is going down in the memory files as one heck of a time!

"event","so i had written this all out on myspace, and then it didn't save... so hopefully this will work on here and i won't lose all my thoughts again...

basically this whole post is about me... ha, what a shocker! but its serious... not just another, this is what i have done today type thing... anyway- this morning while i was doing my counseling homework, i think i tapped into some un-dealt with emotions. for our homework we were to counsel ourselves, be both the client and the counselor. the topic i dealt with was my low self-esteem. I really have no idea where it stemmed from, because its not like my parents are divorced or my parents were abusive physically, mentally or emotionally... I didn't have anything negative happen to me, that i can remember... except for moving around alot. so i touched on that subject for a while. when i got down to it, i think that this could have played a big role in why I don't have such a good self-esteem. it seemed that we moved every yeaer or two, and therefore, i was never really able to establish a consistency in my life that a lot of people are fortunate to have. I think that this played a huge part also, because it was during my adolescent years that we seemed to move the most, and the time when i was most influenced I was around people with whom left me with negatives instead of positives... I was left with always feeling that i was never good enough, that i would never be good enough, and that i always had to, for whatever reason, try to BE good, and better. the evil of comparing. Why does any of that even matter? its so retarded! i know that i am my own individual, that i am perfect in the eyes of Christ, so why should i care what others think of me, how they feel about it. IT DOESN'T MATTER! but... in my head, i guess it does. Even now in my life, everything is great. I have the best of friends, I am obtaining an education and will inevitably obtain a career, all things in which a lot of people are not fortunate enough to have. and yet, it feels like something is missing. my romantic side would say its because i haven't found ""the one."" but in all honesty a man is not going to bring me happiness. I think i will only be able to achieve true happiness in life, is when i finally just realize that i am beautiful and that i am smart, and that nothing people say or do can bring me down. they are just people, like me, and they are probably struggling, just like me, to feel better about themselves. I think the hardest part is knowing what needs to be done... because its like you know you KNOW, and yet, when you don't see the fruit of the labor, it gets discouraging and puts you right back in the lowly state of life. Some might think that i am depressed and that maybe i need drugs. But, that is a lie. true drugs could help, but in my point of view, they are only masking the problem. you will only get better when you are strong enough to face the problem head on and deal with it. thats what i have found to be true, through psychology classes and counseling classes both. those who are willing to change, will. but those who dont... won't. anyway- i know that, again, i will only find true happiness when i just give all my stupid thoughts and feelings to God and leave them in His hands. I know i will struggle, because I am human, and its inevitable, but I know that God knows my heart, and He will meet me where I am. 
God I just pray that you WILL meet me, and help me to be who you have created me to be, your awesome princess, your beautiful daughter. Please, just hold me close to you, and help me to stop pretending my way through life. to be real, and help me to just be satisified with who you have made me to be. Help me be encouraged daily by those you have put into my life and through your word and miracles that occur everyday. I love you so much, and I thank you for all that you have done for me. Continue to work Lord! Its all in your wonderful name I pray... AMEN"

"event","so, didnt get home last night until like 4:00am... so i decided that I wasn't going to church today. maybe that was a bad decision, but i didnt really feel well anyway. so i slept until 12:45. that was nice, i took a shower, and now i am eating ramean noodles... breakfast of champions! lol... So banquet was boring! It obviously was for the seniors, but dang... there was like no real interaction or anything. I won a goldfish though, it was the centerpiece. I think i named him finny... hahaha. The food was good too at banquet, so i guess I shouldnt really complain. we went and watched benchwarmers last night too. that was a good movie. I liked it alot. there were a lot of sexual innuendos about gay people and stuff... but i guess if you look past that, its a good movie. we then went to ihop and hung out there. i had this banana and carmel cheesecake thing.... and it was good, but i realized that I dont like hot cheesecake! but anyway- we then went back to steves and they watched a movie called Top Secret... i went and took a nap in steves room. yeah... so that was basically my weekend. I have to do laundry today and my counseling homework. tomorrow are the dang chaney lectures... so i guess i dont have to go to my classes... but I should probably still do my homework.... so i guess i am done rambling now.

ummm... so YAY! its Friday... that makes me uber excited.. no real huge plans for this weekend.  banquet is tomorrow... i guess i am happy about that. i like dressing up, and i think i am gonna look sooooo hot! :-) hahhaa... that makes me laugh i hate feeling conceited, but i guess its a good thing sometimes. GOSH... sometimes some people... just them walking into a room really just IRKS me soooo much! i dont know why... what is it about a person that can just make you feel this BLAH about them... this innate sense of dang i dont like that person... wow.. that was real mean... hummmm not dont like... but like wow you're annoying, can you shut up and get off your phone and never talk again... ohhh way worse... wow... nickie needs to be NICE... happy happy nice nice nickie... umm anyway- bout to go to walmart to get some pictures developed... fun fun... i will share them, and it will be great... later!

Katie, Sarah C and I went and looked at our basement dwelling tonight.... and its sooo awesome! i was thinking it was going to be some nasty stuffy gross cellar basement, but its nice! it has, when you first walk down there, a BIG room, like a living room type area, then to the very back, there is one room, and then another room... and there is also a bathroom down there with a shower and everything. I am excited! It is only costing us each $150... yeah, maybe thats crazy that each of us has to pay that much, but that includes all utilities and everything... and well, i think its not bad at all! dang, it happened again... i was gonna say something, and then i totally forgot! GRR... I now just have to find a job... Dillons I guess is hiring and so is the deli... so i will check out those two places... and hopefully everything will work out well. yay! well... ummm... i ran out of things to write about.. so i should go tobed now... lovely sleep... yay!

I guess i just kinda miss my mom... I miss her hugs and her in general. i dont really know where that came from... but i guess its true. so... anyway- i should go study some more before i bomb this biology test. later!

I hate the way you look at me- it makes me think you care.
I hate the way you look at her- makes me feel like I'm not there.
I hate the way I think of you- you're always on my mind.
I hate the way you're so sweet, so funny and so kind.
I hate the way I can't understand its never going to be.
I hate the way no one ever seems to fall for someone like me.
I know that its not your fault- you never even knew.
I just wish I could have been the one who you liked, but thats just too good to be true...

thats just how i feel... i know i know.... someday my love will come... but sometimes a girl just gets impatient! AHHH!! lol oh well... anyway- later friends!

"event","tonight was such a fricken blast... to say the least! I dont remember when I had so much good wholesome outside fun. Let me give you a recap of the events that took place, and see if you can relate, and understand my whole experience, and tell me if that was fun or not... ok here goes...
well today, the first of April, was a really rather warm day at a whopping 80 degrees. pretty dang nice!... so we hung out walked around down town for a while. then we were just hanging out as friends at steves house, until dinner time. after dinner we, steve, paul, sarah and I, went to Coronado heights and watched the storm come in. it was great fun, and we built a little fire in the castle. THe lightening was amazing! Makes you just marvel at all that God has made and all the awesome things he is doing, and is going to do! so, after it began to pour really hard, we decided we should probably head home before the roads got all muddy and bad... so we went and visited Sav, Sarahs sister at Bethany. that was kinda cool, a little awkward, but alright. I like Sav enough, so it didnt matter too much. :-p then we went and got some beverages at the gas station... we got into town, and we were hitting all the huge puddles with the car, and i was like, we should just get out and walk home the rest of the way... and so we did. we jumped in puddles and kicked in puddles and ran through puddles, it was soo much fun! I dont think i ever experienced such fun with puddles in my life! So, we get almost back to steves house, and Fish, our friend Josh fisher, drives up and asks us if we want a ride, we oblige and Paul, he is one silly fella, he climbed on the back of the blazer and held on... riding on the bumper standing up. well, we got to like Ave. A and Maple, and I guess a cop flashed his lights at us... Paul jumped off and started running, and we just darted through some side streets and got away... it was scary and fun... hahah. so we get back to campus, and we tried to find some more puddles... no real luck. We wanted to hit up some more grand puddles, so we tried to go to Wall Park, but there were no puddles there either... so we came back and cleaned up and went back to steves. We then just hung out and listened to some music. all in all it was a really fun, great day. I didnt even take a nap! wow! lol anyway- I think i need to go to sleep, i set all my clocks ahead, and i will be losing an hour... so later!

"event","so today was an overall decent day. i went and got my dress for banquet, so thats was cool. it was really depressing though, because all these cute dresses that were cheap, of course, didn't fit me... dang it all! oh well... and i even got up the guts, i guess with prompting, to ask Dave to go to banquet with me.... just as friends... so thats cool I guess. I had this really weird feeling tonight, like before i was hanging out with everyone again... and it was that feeling where its like... your all alone, and you feel as if no one cares that you even exist.... so i went to my room and sat there and read for a little while. of course, it was all just a big fat lie from satan, because lovely sarah was wondering where i was... but my other friends neve relayed the message to me... oh well... i have been thinking about guys a lot lately too... like... i dont really wanna write about it all on here, but its just weird.. and i dont know... its all just so dumb. why cant it all just happen like in the movies or something... your just walking along one day and then its like... so... i like you... so theres that, and a nice cute dance and then a hug and kiss... its not like that at all... its all hmmm i wonder what the heck he is thinking.. i wonder if he ever thinks about me... i wonder if he even realizes that i exist... and its soooo retarded! you would think that college would be better... but its just not. i guess i need to be patient and just let God work his wonders... but its so hard... especially when you just want it soo bad! UGH!! oh well... anyway... i should probably go to bed at some time tonight... so later

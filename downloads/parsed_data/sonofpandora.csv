"event","I have five minutes, but I know I haven't written a journal in so long. Well, my rollercoaster of a love life has official stopped for at least a week. I hope to stay single for a while and do some more self-exploration before I get ""involved"" again. I feel like such an emotional slut sometimes. I need attention, and I need it now!!! I've been thinking a little bit about Matt lately. Brian, don't kill me! He's just really sweet and cuddly and damn sexy. Oops, I didn't say that. Whatever, I'll talk to you guys later.

""I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set a trembling in my bones
I know no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown"""

"event","My love life is taking a definite turn right now. I can't believe that I'm starting yet a new relationship with another person. I feel like I've fouled up all of the other relationships that I've been in, so why should this be any different? I really like the guy that I'm ""seeing"". We seem to be very alike in many ways. One of the main similarities is stubborness. And that is something that I really fear, that we'll will be too stubborn to show our feelings to one another. I don't know, maybe I worry too much. I just don't want to lose another person in my life. It hurts way too much, even though each time it happens, I get more and more callous to it. I can't wait to see Mark tomorrow. We're going to Borders after he gets out of work. He's so beautiful!
""I'm standing at the edge of another precipice in life
Gotta face my steppenwolf
Gotta drag you through the mud
When I get there I will see myself
I will look for strength within
I will be a better (wo)man
Hang in there baby
I'm the grain of sand
Becoming the pearl"""

"event","Well, yesterday was an interesting day. Spent the night Marci and Camille. I didn't realize that I was such a shitty driver. Me and Marci had some fun at the Triangle. I met three gorgeous guys and one beautiful girl. And I just added a new guy to my list of boy toys. His name is Mark. And I'm tired so I'm going to bed!"

"event","Hey guys,
    Just sitting here with Brian, being stupid. I'm so excited, this morning I went to a women's history play about Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, and Amelia Bloomer. I didn't know that Amelia Bloomer was the first woman to produce, edit, and publish a newspaper, called the Lily.
    Yesterday, I had so much fun with Marci, Jakob, Melissa, James, Larkin, and Camille. Even though, I sucked at dodgeball and Jakob had that puke incident in Melissa's car. Ooops!
    I plan to go to the gay bar tonight and dance it up!!! Weeee!
    I can't wait to go on the Holocaust Trip to Washington DC, and then to the March for Women's Lives. I've never really been in an official march or demonstration. Makes me nervous thinking about it!
    Brian's being a drama queen right now, wo dere, wo dere, wo dere!
    Have a dice nay!

Mike G."

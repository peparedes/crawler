"event","In accordance with the President's directive that office protocol be once again be instated and <i>adhered to</i>, I have designed a new system for the filing of 

A) Mission reports
B) Logistical Matters
C) Complaints and Office Affairs

<lj-cut text=""PROTOCOL AND LOGISTICS"">

With regards to A):

Tseng-senpai will no doubt have his own protocol for official submission to him and upwards. <I>However</i>, since the office is in <s>a complete and utter mess</s> a state of disorder, I appeal to the senpai-tachi to label their internal office submissions to ensure that, once the system returns to full functionality, searching and finding reports will no longer be an issue.

1. LABEL all missions according to 
1a: DATE [YYYYMMDD OR, if range necessary, YYYYMMDD(mission start) to YYYYMMDD(mission end)]
1b: TIME [0000-2359 twenty-four hour format ONLY]
1c: LOCATION [In order of: Continent, Region, City, Sector, District, Building, Building Code, Room Number. Delete and trim where appropriate.]
1d: PARTIES INVOLVED [Turk(s) (Name, ID) and any external involvement]
1e: URGENCY [Allowed tags: Urgent, Important, High, Normal, Low]

2: INCLUDE in the header:
2a:SUMMARY [Not more than six hundred words.]
2b: RELEVANCY [CC or BCC to Department, Office, Person (eg: Administrative Research, Director's Office, Tseng OR Executive Level, President's Office, President Shinra)]

3: INCLUDE in the body of your report:
3a: Overview of situation
3b: Difficulties encountered
3c: Solution executed
3e: Possible follow-up action 

4: INCLUDE in the footer:
4a: NETWORKING [Relevant contacts acquired/referenced in format of Association, Position, Name, Number(s) (eg: 
4b: ACCOUNTABILITY [Injuries incurred, Damage to <i>Company</i> property, Expenditure]
4c: TIMESTAMP 

NOTE:

<u>RE: Submission of reports with deadlines</u>

The system has been programmed to enter hibernation mode at 2200 every day, meaning that NO submissions into the system will be entertained. They will be rejected, and any drafts or final copies will NOT be automatically saved. <small>You have been warned.</small> This is firstly for security reasons, as system instability makes it safer for our records to be taken offline and into read-only mode until proper firewalls are set up. Secondly because the internal filing system <i>is not a bulletin board</I>. Requests for days off, rescheduling, packed lunches, chocobo-hire and/or the last company betting pool will NOT BE FILED ON THE SYSTEM. <small>Thank you. All personal notes will not be posted solely on the new corkboard that has been purchased and placed in the communal hallway. Thumbtacks and note paper (I bought some nice white and red pieces until the company reprints the old notepads we used to have...) are readily available in the nearby drawer.</small>

With regards to B): 

Logistical matters

DEFINTION of logistical matters: any issues involving storage, handling and provision of COMPANY supplies with regards to ADMINISTRATIVE RESEARCH. 

Until the Logistics Department moves back into their offices, I will be helping to handle the office supplies. I look forward to helping the senpai-tachi with their <i>relevant</i> needs!

With regards to C): 

Complaints

May be directed elsewhere until the files which have taken up hibernation in the common room have been properly filed and taken stock of. I have thirteen more reams of paper and four hard drives worth sitting in the corner of my office along. If you would like to adopt a further five, ten or fifteen reams, it would be very much appreciated. <small>Especially since Tseng-senpai is back and I really can't edit out all your spelling errors on my own.</small> 

Office affairs

The manufacturers just got back with the new four-panel digital storage readers to replace the ones lost. Collect yours from my outbox; they've made them slimmer so they now fit in a waterproof leather skin case. Just in case anyone decides to pour water on theirs and ""lose"" their reports and mission briefs again. I got everybody's names engraved in the top right corner of their respective readers, so please check! 

 Thank you!
</lj-cut>

I am becoming an office paperweight, considering the amount of fieldwork I am getting in with all this silly paper and paper and paper and <small>what happens if I can't fit into the uniform after this, oh god, I think this is getting to my head, I need to go to the gym...</small>"

"event","Communications left in a mess again; cleared it up and reset the connections so that the network lag on several of the lines have been lifted. Re-filed the WRO contact sheet (intact) for anyone who wants to refer to it for purposes of <i>work</i>. And if my seniors (superiors? I respect no man who allows coffee rings to deposit on important documents) are working, they are doing a good job of hiding it. 

A bath now, if there is hot water.

<small>OOC: Uh, Shinra-s? I guess I <I>reallly</i> need to talk to everyone. xD *headdesk* I have no idea how/where/what the world's like, so am flailing. Feel free to poke at any weirdbits!</small>"

<lj-cut text=""Elena App"">

<b>Personality</b>: 

Elena is defined by half-blind tenacity, earnestness and the driving desire to serve, and fulfil. To be a Turk was her dream, and she pursued it with a relentlessness and completeness that most would see and call, amongst other things, blind, undeniable proof of her lack of self-preservation skills and also a certain indication of blonde stupidity. But her will and drive prove to be the things that determine her character: she has a burning need to prove herself, to be tested and to be found as worthy. It makes her mouth loose at times, but she's learned when to say what, and when to put her loquaciousness to... good use.

Her inferiority complex is still present, but it's the remaining dregs of adapting to her place with the Turks. Finding herself working amongst the people she had idolised for ages muddled her in the beginning, driving her to speak nonsensically and absently around Tseng, prissily towards Reno and Rude, so on and so forth. She has a strong sense of vision and the conception of what <I>ought</I> to be. Being placed in the position of realising her dreams - in a position of nitty, gritty reality that wasn't all glory-honour-servitude - humbled her. The events in Advent Children and the harsh understanding of what Shinra was and had done woke Elena. Her high-handed fantasy of an elite killing force working for a future as defined by Shinra was questioned by hard, long work which was only rewarded by torture, evil bastards and rain. It tore down her naivety, but at the same time solidified her belief in working towards rebuilding what <I>they</I>, the infallible Turks, the infallible Shinra, had torn down. She believes in people now not because of her dreams and self-made impressions, but because she knows they are worthy of honour and faith. She has the analytic ability - when removed from the situation and calm enough - to pause and consider anew what she had once been colour- and sin-blind to. It's not that she will not believe in Shinra wholeheartedly. Only that she will not believe them <I>blindly.</I>

Still, Elena is Elena. A little uptight at times, a little snippy. She's young, and hasn't been around long enough to get those inside jokes, the easy camaraderie, the on-off switch between whipcrack blonde killing machine and ditzy blonde girl. She's a Turk who can still blush, albeit not as readily as before. But she came out of Advent Children retaining her humanity in spite of her spirit being severely tested. Her fierce, devoted, undeniable loyalty is what pulls her through. It will not be questioned. Elena will put aside awkwardness, self-pity, self-doubt, personal discomfort and suffering for the sake of what she believes in: Shinra.

But, er, also, hang on, senpai-tachi, I forgot to get a hairpin, can't see with my fringe in my eyes, oh god!, <I>sorry!</I> Sorry!

Abilities wise? Can shoot, <s>can't score.</s> Good at being efficient, when she's in her element. She's a Turk. She'll do what Turks do best. XD

<b>Background:</b>

When younger, wanted to be a Turk. Worked to prove herself and to enter ranks on her own merit, and not because of her father or her sister or anyone else. She idolised the members of the Turks: for their efficiency, their ability, their confidence and their fearlessness. She found her own bumbling country-girl-in-a-Midgar-plate mannersims sorely lacking in comparison to suited-up ever readiness. She had an aim, to prove herself: and she had the hardheaded daring and blind idealism to go on and do it.

As a junior Turk, she was a liability. Placed amongst the stars she'd clawed her way up to be ranked with, calm deserted her. She was struck with the dizzy reality of being one of them, of getting there, of being a Turk and working for Shinra and she would do<I> anything </I>to prove how proud she was of it. Her mouth opened once too often, her words slipped when they shouldn't have, she fumbled when under pressure that she herself made unbearable and she threw herself into danger just because she felt that Shinra needed it done. She was a blushing puppet on Shinra-made strings.

Advent Children changed her. Rufus was found, half-dead, in the remains of the silver tower she'd once seen as impregnable. They had to build it back themselves, rock by rock and stone by stone and with mortar and paste and spit and sweat even in the face of a public which hated them. Later, captured and tortured in the face of duty, she had to learn the quality of keeping her mouth shut and her faith stronger than ever. She discovered how human the Turks were. How human and how weak they could be, and how their views could be as wrong as the next man's on the street. It tore down on her idealism, but not on her faith as she re-evaluated what the newly re-emerging tower would come to mean. She made her decision: but after long thought, bloodshed and exposure to things she'd never imagined possible. She still screamed <I>Tseng-senpai</I> at the Northern Cavern. But at the end of Advent Children, she stood in front of Rufus and watched, without blinking.

Now she's coming into herself fully. Still awkward in some ways and manners, but growing into the independence and competence that her experiences have already expanded.

<b>Likes</b>: A certain amount of organisation. Not too military, but not <I>messy</I>, either. A sense of seniority. She won't pander to it any more, but it's comforting and <I>respectful</I>. Something to believe in. People she can trust with her life. Some down time is also necessary for your local Elena-Turk.

<b>Dislikes</b>: Over-flippancy. Playing on the job. People insulting what she believes in. Jokes about female Turks in pants. Those jokes about female Turks in <I>skirts</I>, which are worse.

<b>Third person narrative sample post:</b>

'Shinra.'

Her voice came over the system clear and articulate in spite of the static. In spite of the fact that <I>someone</I> (she didn't even want to think <I>who</I>) had left the operations table in a mess of tangled wires, mishandled dials and scraps of paper with scribbled numbers and codes, half of which had been important (excessively so) and the other half of which had been numbers for a local order-in service (<I>Hello, Midgar Delivery, would you like to take a </I>- click), a Wall Market brothel (<I>We're closed for today, but our ladies' legs are always op--</I> click) and, of all the Shiva-damned things, Rufus' private line (Shachou. (<I>Oh, </I><I>crap</I>.) <I>Apologies, this will not happen again, my de-- </I>click. (Oh, my god.)).

Her voice carried through, also in spite of the fact that she was sitting in a pathetic tarp-shielded few square feet of the first floor of the Shinra building. Construction was in steady progress, sixteen levels above, support links and griders being shifted painstakingly into place. Lengthy rolls of tape-bound communciation cables and uplink units had been brought in a month before, the need to centralise already growing as the WRO pushed people to seek alternative energy sources and as the people pushed Shinra to give them for free what took millions to produce. The Haelin Lodge was no longer an option as Shinra reconsolidated itself in the disillusioned urban landscape.

Elena, headphones firmly in place and logbook open in front of her, manned what was - for the time being - their central communications unit. Office workers and executives had long fled the company, too scared of public opinion to stay. The stigma of Shinra was worse than the stigma of the body, many believed. So it fell to the last few loyal ones. To sit, two hours and half a bath after killing men who attempted to sabotage one of the few functional reactors left, in the shoddy remains of what had once been a lobby and to take calls from the vulgar mob. For Shinra, Elena had told herself, right after she'd taken the first of those long shifts, and also right before she'd gone and raided her cabinets for something hard enough, and alcoholic.

<I>'We are representatives of the Urban Redevelopment Committee, part of the WRO-'</I>

'I am afraid,' Elena said sharply, referring immediately to a list that she'd wrenched free from a particularly persistant coffee stain (she'd been half in tears; <I>firstly </I>because it was the only copy they had there and <I>secondly </I>because the <I>person</I> responsible was going to be in a lot of pain afterwards and thirdly because she hadn't had anything on hand to clean the mess up with, Tseng was going to have her...). Sent directly from Reeve listing his co-operators, a necessary document to separate the wheat from the chaff and the opportunist bastards from the supportive minitory. 'That your <I>organisation</I> has no affiliation whatsoever with the WRO, and therefore no affiliation whatsoever with Shinra. Thank you for calling.'

The connection was cut with a satisfying snare of static. Elena leaned back, and sighed. The signal came on again a second later. <I>Men, </I>she thought, spitefully, <I>persistant despots,</I> and reconnected.

'I would <I>not</I> like to repeat myself, <I>sir</I>, take your busine--'

'Elena.'

Oh. Crap.

'Ah. Senpai.'</lj-cut>"

love the lyrics

When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now,
Will you still be sending me a Valentine,birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'till quarter to three,would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
Hmm------mmm---mmmh.
You'll be older, too.Aaah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wightif it's not to dear. We shall scrimp and save.
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?"

#1 - got my final paper for my freshmen seminar class. it says that it's due on the 21st, which is amazingly great becasue that's the class that i was going to have the final on the 23rd for. soo....that means, no final on the 23rd! wooohoooo....now, i can go home one day earlier....or wait, more good news?...

#2 - realized that my psych paper is due on the 22nd...on, or BEFORE! so, if i'm a good little girly and get it done early, i can possibly go home the day before that. after my social issues final (3 hours, fun fun) on the 21st.

"event","ok, so i had a really great break
it was too short and didn't get to see some people i wanted to, but for the most part i was very happy with what i got to do and who i did get to see. ps. i really have the sweetest bf and at times i don't think that i deserve him because i'm a jerk, but i really do appreciate and love him immensely.

it's nice to be back, though...whoa, who said that? *looks over shoulder*
but really, it's weird, i get work done and feel so independent here, which is really great for me.
getting up for 8 o'clock classes aren't that fun, though...but, there's not many of those left, thank god.

anyway, the reason of this entry is to share a song with you guys. jamie listens to really great music, all different kinds, and most of them are really great. anyone ever heard of the spill canvas? well, i hadn't, but now i really like them. this song is her and ergin's song, and i can't help but love it. you really have to hear it to get the full effect, i think...it's worth downloading...it's called ""so much""

so, here is it...

How does it feel to know you're everything I need
The butterflies in my stomach
They could bring me to my knees
How does it feel to know you're everything I want
I've got a hard time saying this
So I'll sing it in a song

Oh I adore the way you carry yourself
With the grace of a thousand angels overhead
I love the way the galaxy starts to melt
When we become one
When we become one
When we become one
When we become one

How does it feel
How does it feel when we get locked into a stare?
Please don't come looking for me
When I get lost in the mess of your hair
How do you feel when everything you've known
Gets thrown aside
Never fear, my dear, 'cause we have nothing left to hide

Oh I adore the way you carry yourself
With the grace of a thousand angels overhead
I love the way the galaxy starts to melt

Hold on to me girl
If you feel your grip getting loose
Just know that I'm right next to you
Hold on to me girl
If you feel your grip getting loose
Just know that I won't let you down

Well, I'm ready
Well, I'm ready
I am ready
To run away with you
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
To run away with me

Pack your things we can leave today
Pack your things we can leave today
Say our goodbyes and get on the train
Say goodbye
Just you and I in the sweet unknown
We can just call each other our home

If I had to choose a way to die
It'd be with you
In a goosebump infested embrace
With my overanxious hands cupping your face
In a goosebump infested embrace
With my overanxious hands cupping your cherub face

How does it feel?"

Your birth on the 10th day of the month adds a tone of independence and extra energy to your life. 

The number 1 energy suggest more executive ability and leadership qualities than you path may have indicated.

A birthday on the 10th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. 



This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush. 

You are sensitive, but your feeling stay somewhat repressed. 

You have a compelling manner that can be dominating in many situations.</td>

"event","great poem...

ee cummings is a cool guy...

somewhere i have never travelled

somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond
any experience,your eyes have their silence:
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near

your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skilfully,mysteriously) her first rose

or if your wish be to close me,i and
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;

nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture
compels me with the color of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing

(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens; only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody,not even the rain, has such small hands


this one's really sad...but, sweet nonetheless...

it may not always be so; and i say 

it may not always be so;and i say
that if your lips,which i have loved,should touch
another's,and your dear strong fingers clutch
his heart,as mine in time not far away;
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
in such a silence as i know,or such
great writhing words as,uttering overmuch,
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;
   
if this should be,i say if this should be-
you of my heart,send me a little word;
that i may go unto him,and take his hands,
saying,Accept all happiness from me.
Then shall i turn my face,and hear one bird
sing terribly afar in the lost lands."

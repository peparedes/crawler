"event","So Ive been practicing the crap outta my baritone for the last 2 hours, and I can now play the first half of a page (out of 3 pages) of the Cavie audition music at tempo! Now its no extreme sexiness or anything, but its coming along quite well.

Now I am terribly sorry that I have been speaking of nothing but band for the latest entrees, but its just craziness. Lets see, what else is shakin...

Ive been working at Pizza City lately..yes, again. But now I work inside, cooking and taking orders and whatnot... Oh yea, and who can forget slicing onions. I think Ive become immune to whatever it is that makes onions onions. With the tearing and the eyes and whatnot.

My mom has been bitc- i mean complaining to me over and over again about getting another job cause she doesnt think I like what Im doing and that Im not making enough money. Hell, i only work 3 days a week, and i could work more if i wanted to. Why to mothers never just forget about it? Ass."

"event","So the reason I havent updated lately is because I just got over going crazy over the damn Cavalier Audition Music. Seems I did have something to worry about. Its 3 pages long, with running 32nds with 64ths tied into the runs. What kind of terrible person even comes up with something like that!? And to top it off, its in the key of E major! 4 Sharps! Ive never played that! All the music Ive played has just been in flat key signatures. Messed up man. 

So Ive counted out all the rhythms and finally got to playing an E scale for the first time ever...it was kinda of nasty, but the second time was pertyful.

And then of course my dad has to ask ""Do you have to memorize it?""
I SURE AS HELL HOPE NOT!!!!

Aight yo, I gotta go lay some clear coat on a car and rid it off my garage space. CYA!"

"event","So its been a while since Ive updated. Holy Crap....Well not all that much has happened. I found out how to get a picture for this site. Its about damn time, haha. I went to the DCI Semis last week in Foxboro, Ma. It was too awesome, The Cadets won, Cavaliers in second, but I have to admit, the Cadets did have an awesome show. Oh well. Brian, the little bugger went off to college, how could he do such a terrible thing. At least we got a decent recording of our band before he left. If anyone fancies a listen, go to www.purevolume.com/campingwithroger and listen to Whispers.

Ive been kind of depressing over the fact that Im stuck sitting around here till my audition for the Cavies in November, and to make it worse, I wont even get my audition music for another week, AHH! lol. I think Im just gonna make myself know as the ""loser from the graduating class who still follows around the band"" and be a parkside fan. I have plenty of friends still in it anyways, I have my excuse, although its really just about the music (haha, jk guys).

Well thats all for now, I have to go work on someones car...oh by the way, if anyone needs bodywork or anything done to your car, dont be afraid to at least ask me about it, I have alot of experience in the field and can do the work for a crapload less than a body shop can. Mainly because the charge an insane amount of money for labor. Thanks."

On fathers day theres a DCI show in Lisle, IL, not too far from where ill be, so im definitely going to see that (got the tickets on will-call already). Theres going to be at least 10 bands there, including the Cavies, Phantom Reg., Mad. Scouts, Cadets (i think). Itll be quite the sexiness. Umm...

"event","I dont get it. Why the hell are people here so damn lazy. This is the third time Ive had to deal with shitty auto technicians. First was S&N, who had the 240sx for a year, and called me several times telling me it was ready, when really, it wasnt even close. Then, Vernons Transmission shop, who had our Jeep CJ-5 for 10 months to rebuild the transmission. And now theres Johns, who dont give flying fuck about the fact that my car is, as of today, 5 days late for delivery, and still counting. The work ethic on this damn peninsula is bullshit. People ask me: ""why dont you like living in maryland?"" Well Ill tell you, its the fact that people here dont give a shit about their customers and figure they can just finish whenever is convienent to them. My car has been in the shop for over a month now; yes, it was in bad shape, but if its something I could fix in literally 3 days in my own garage, youd think theyed be able to pull it off in a month. And its for damn sure that a body shop anywhere near a city would pull it off in no time, cause they actually give a damn. I guess my expectations are just too damn high for a bunch of rednecks out in the middle of nowhere."

"event","YAY, massive road trip type action this past weekend. I went to DC to pick up one of my cousins and her friend at their apartment, it was quite the fun. Then we had to do ""family stuff""..but it wasnt thhhaaattt bad. And of course, i drove them back on monday. Traffic was perfect, all the way to DC, i was quite surprised. On my way out of DC I passed the White House, flipping it off of course. 

Today was my last day of highschool, and it was only an hour. SWEETNESS. But now I have to go through all this graduation crap that I could care less about. Its not like I have any connection to this school what so ever. I mean yea, theres band and collision repair. But both of them are organizations that get no help at all from the school, they basically support themselves. So if they wanted to be independent, they could be. So on behalf of the Band and Collision Repair people ""SCREW YOU PARKSIDE! Youre just using us to make a name for yourself."" Anywhos, Im quite happy to be rid of the responsibilities (or lack there of) of school. 

I get my car back any day now, and oh boy cant I wait. Ive got a K&N typhoon high flow intake, SPT short shifter, and an HKS Sequential Blow Off Valve waiting for it, as well as a couple of wicked awesome HELLA fog/driving lights that Im gonna mount on the bumper. Its gonna look ""bad ass yo""."

"event","Well it never hurts to start things off with the good:

-I get my car back on Friday, which is wicked awesome. I have a K&N Typhoon Intakes and a SPT Short Shifter waiting for it.
-Umm, Graduation is a week from tomorrow, also quite awesome.
- And, believe it or not, I finally finished my very own arrangement of Power Rangers for marching band (no woodwinds, yay!). Im quite proud of myself. Only problem is, the begining has a nice ""opener"" sounds, but the ending has an awesome ""closer"" sound, so it wouldnt make for much of a show, haha.

And of course, the bad:

- Me and my mother practically hate eachother. Arguements are fun. She doesnt want me driving to Chicago all of a sudden, even though Ive had this planned for half a year and she has had no problem with it. Not to mention, IVE DONE IT BEFORE! So it looks like Im stuck her for the summer, cause there is no point in going anywhere if i dont have a car to get me around once i get there.
-Hmm, lets see...Ha, my mom tells me multiple times she wants me out of the house. Something I have taken into high consideration. 
- We were driving the other day on Rt. 90. And shes been bitchin about how im driving ever since we left the house. ""youre going too fast"" ""two hands on the wheel"" ""stop tailgating"". Of course we get into it, yada yada blah blah. ""IM DRIVING ON THE WAY HOME DAMNIT"" she yells. So im done taking shit from her. I check the mirror to make sure the car behind us is far enough away, then I stomp on the brakes and cut the wheel right, pulling onto the shoulder, releasing the brake just before the car flips, you could feel both back and the front right wheels pulling off of the ground. That was exciting, and it surely shut her up."

"event","So, yes, it has been a while...what is new. Ah yes, I went to that prom type ordeal last friday. That was interesting, to say the least. I didnt have the greatest of times, but it was worth being there. The after party was what made it all worth it. I never get to hang out with so many people for such a period of time anymore. Thats something I would be used to doing back in Chicago. The night was of course topped off by being bitched at by my ""date"", Which is always fun. I guess I got her home an hour late or something. However, even if I had known that she had to be home. I wasnt about to leave one of the only things that had made me happy in a long time to take her home. If her parents want her home at a certain time, they can pick her up, or she can just not go. But Im not giving up something I havnt had in 3 years because I have to take her home (its not even her prom in the first place). Go ahead, call me selfish.

And another thing! Why must everything ALWAYS be about her. Ive heard it straight from her own mouth. Ive known her not even 1 month, and according to her she should be top priority, all the time. Life doesnt work that way. Im not going back to the type of relationship where I have to always put my friends second. A word to advice for all you in a relationship: If your bf/gf would rather hang out with a friend, or even by themselves - DEAL WITH IT! Never try to invite yourself along, damn is that annoying.


By the way- Steven and Caitlin, Happy 1 year. I couldnt be happier for you.

"event","So long this week is rolling alone quite nicely. I might have a prom date in Illinois...how about that. Ill probably go, she was quite the good friend of mine (yes, just friend).  
 Ohhh, and then there is the meir fact that my baritone arrived today. Mmm, its sexy...its too bad I left my music at school, so the only thing i could play on it was what I remembered from this years marching show. But it still sounds insanely good.
 And of course, I save the best for last (how cliche). The one and only Caitlin forced me to come over to her house after school on monday and give her my senior portrait. I guess she was desperate to see what I had written to go along with it (you know how people always write little notes with them). So she read it, and I guess she liked what she read, because...well we'll just say something gave me that impression; Which really makes me happy because it reminded me of how strong our friendship really is, and it reassured me that to her Im not just ""another friend"". 

Sorry- I went alittle bit sappy just then..."

It was the speed of a moderate Ballad, ew ew ew. I was definitely NOT in the mood. The senior band was awesome, but the music was just aweful. It doesnt matter how good a band is, if the music sucks, its all over. I still had an awesome time, mainly because of the people I was with, Thanks alot guys!"

"event","The funny thing is, I woke up today feeling better than I have in months, hell, i was actually out of bed but 735! I thought to myself ""thisll be a good day"". 

Not so much. 

Lets skip straight to the worst. I got T-boned. And to top it off, it was more or less my fault. To the few who actually give a damn. Yes, Im alright. To the rest of you, yes, my car is in pieces. Of course im making it sound worse than it actually is. But given my experience in the body repair industry, I know theres at least $5 thousand worth of damage. And thats hoping that the frame didnt cave in on me, but it was at a fairly low speed, so i dont think it did. I will tell you, however. That everything that has to deal with the front right suspension needs replacement. As well as the right fender, front/rear door skins (possibly an entire front door). And the dogleg either needs to be sectioned or pulled. This is the last i need. 

I wont be in school monday. I have to go to Johns Auto Body in Berlin (i dont trust any of the shops in Salisbury) and get everything taken care of (estimate and whatnot). Its not like I could go to school on monday anyway, i left all of my school stuff in the trunk. Whoopsies, I wont mind a day off.

And to top it off, i know that all i have to look forward to is the insurance $1000 deductable, and of course the bitching from the usual people (you know who you are, so i suggest you stay out of it). And just in case you feel like laughing up a storm at me, ill let you know that i could care less about getting suspended, much less expelled. My odds of graduating this year are slim anyways, so ive got nothing to lose. And if youre not in school, consider yourself in a much worse situation."

That just adds to the fun though. One of my friends from Chicago got into Johns Hopkins and shes coming in to visit on Sunday. Since she has nothing to do on Sunday Im gonna pick her up at BWI and we'll aimlessly wander around Baltimore and get lost. Should be fun.
  I got my little form thing for this Cavalier weekend camp that is happening in July. It more of an instructional thing than a trying out for the band thing. But i figure i should go, Ill get to know what its like and all. The orgasmic part is we get to sit in on a Cavalier horn line rehearsal, then rehearse with them. Sexy. So Ive been spending the last 30 minutes filling out this form. 
  Well Ive got to go to work...yeha.

"event","So I went off roading this morning at about 3am... I didnt mean too. That lack of sleep finally caught up to me as I was following David to his house in Willards. Lets just say its a good thing that I drifted to the right into the big ass ditch, cause to the left was nothing but trees. So yah...the back right tire was literally submerged in mud. It took the tow truck driver an hour and a half to get it out. He even busted a few chains doing so. I am by far, the luckiest person on the planet, besides being covered in mud, the car was spotless, no damage to the body or even the suspension! I actually feel a bit guilty about walking away from this incident with no damage what so ever. However I did just spend a good hour pulling an entire farm out from under my car, chicken shit included. So that was fun..."

To top it off, of course Im failing english. I dont know what the hells going on, Im back to the stage of constantly feeling ""bleh"" except for the rare but pleasing moments that bring themselves up every now and again. Like when I think about visiting Chicago, things get better. Thats definitely got to be part of it, I need to rid myself of this town for a few days. Go to Chicago, see a familiar face.

I dont know why, its the perfect occasion to show off to people in intermediate band, and to freak the crap out of the 8th graders. What else could you possibly ask for!?

I just got back from my grandmothers. She lives in Mallard Landing now, in one of the apartments. She just moved up from North Carolina. Wow, those apartments are sooo friggin nice. Its huge (for an apartment) and has a balcony with a view of some body of water...ohhh, and if you bend your head far enough, you can see the parking lot! mmm cars.

I want to go to Chicago...Damn my job, it pays good and all, its too bad everyone has to be orderin their food on the weekends. Haha, so Im tryin to get out on a sunday and back on a wednesday so i can still make jazz band. <-- ya ya, band geek, get over it.

This is mainly to my friend Erin - I know Ive promised you that i would start writting depressing sappy shit sooner or later... And i have something that I think will do the trick.

We did most of the catching up the last time we saw eachother which was last november. So that was quite the awesome. </P>
<P>I hate people who call me spoiled. They can go fuck themselves. Everything I have, Ive paid for with the money I worked my ass off to earn... However, I guess as of now I could be considered alittle bit spoiled. I got a phone call from my dad after school saying that he bought me a horn (pic below). Which makes the fact that ill be trying out for a DCI band official. Im definitely gonna go for The Cavaliers (mostly because theyre in Chicago, not so much that theyre practically the best band out there). Auditions in November, so if I dont talk to anyone by then, its because im too busy practicing my ass off. </P>

"event","So I didnt get to bed til 7am last night...er...this morning. Of course I didnt notice such things...I was too busy workin on cars and hittin it up at Walmart. Mmmm, I bought Closer... Thats quite the movie. Anywhos...

I really have nothing to write about. My life (as of my last entry) has basically consisted of school, work, and very little sleep. Schools a bitch, I have a 61% in english, that might not go over too well. And I just received notice that I have 5 unexcused absences. FIVE! I thought i had like 9. Thats too awesome, now i can take part in senior skip day, if such a thing actually exists. 

(Now Im just trying to take up space) If you even get bored...or feel the need for an entertaining read, you should check this out -

 http://www.fictionpress.com/read.php?storyid=1688503&chapter=1

This is a novel called Borrowed Leather Jacket that one of my acquaintances in Chicago has been writing, Its almost finished. I HATE BOOKS! But this is just so freakishly good. I suppose its one of those coming of age stories...even though the main character is like...22. But trust me, its good. 
-If you get lost like I did trying to find your way to the next chapters, there is a pull down bar at the top and bottom right of the page.

Well I gotta go clean up the house cause we're showing it at 330. This damned thing better sell soon. I hate the real estate process."

"event","So i went to the auto show yesterday in NY. Twas quite satisfactory. There were many orgasmic vehicles present, as well as some not so sexy forms of transportation. I couldnt help but laugh at Suzukis pathetic attempt to make their cars ""cooler"" but putting a crap load of carbon fiber anywhere possible.

We stopped at the Cracker Berrel somewhere in NJ on the way home...I got bored, and wrote my waitress a love poem. It went something like this:

Vickie my love
as the essance of your beauty fills the room
you make my heart
want to go zoom

My brown eyes girl
I just saw your smile
I adore your hair
and your fabulous style

But now my dear
I must bid you good day
I need return to Maryland
Im off and away

It was a wonder to meet you
as great as could be
do you think that by chance
you will remember me?

...Yah, i didnt sign it or anything... I just gave it to her on a napkin and got the hell outta dodge. Haha, it was interesting to say the least. 

So even though we returned at 1030, I didnt get to bed til 1230...which enabled me to arrive at school today at about 9:40. Its sad, most of my unexcused absences are just built up from the number of latenesses I have, o well."

"event","Ok then...I guess Im supposed to be blithering about something...or something. This is obviously my first entry, I was dragged into doing this by one of my friends, damned peer pressure. So....here goes.

This past weekend was ""spring break"". I got to drive to and from D.C. twice to transport my cousin, wasnt that bad, i like to drive. On the way back the second time i stayed the night at U of M College Park with David. Hes leavin school soon, and insisted that I meet all of his gorgeous lady friends. I must say...I met some interesting people. I searched and searched for Chris, but the best I could find was Lindsey ::sigh::. On the way back from UMCP it took me a good hour and a half to make the 30 minute drive to the bay bridge. Traffic was a bitch, but boy did I feel right at home.

Today was the first day back, I had gotten somewhere in the vicinity of 20 hours of sleep in the last 96 hours. I slept like a baby through my first and second period classes...I wasnt even awoken by the bells. 3rd period (study hall) is my usual sleeping time. However, I had other obligations that needed fulfilling.

Of course, tomorrow I have to be at school at 530 in the AM. The collision repair and auto tech classes are goin to NYC for the autoshow. Thatll be a long day. However I get to meet up with a friend of mine from Chicago who will be in NYC for a peace rally or something of that nature. Thatll be cool. :( But Ill miss jazz band.

Tis enough for now. I notice that many people like to fill their live journals with depressing thoughts and sayings...Im sure those are on the way, but i thought i should start out on a happy note."

Man do I love not doing accounting in 2nd hour.  I'm actually an entire chapter behind right now, which i'm sure i'll never make up, but oh well.  Maybe i'll take this class for a third time.  Kara's writing a letter for a college scholarship which reminds me that I need to do the same thing, but I probably wont get the scholarship so I probably wont.  I think i'm gonna start a muscle building diet.  I feel like a lazy whore, especially cause i'm not swimming now.  I want to gain like 15-20 pounds of muscle by the end of the year.  I'm just so tired of being a lanky little bitch.  But this all going to be hard to accomplish considering how much I drink but, what can I say, a man's got to have his priorities."

Call it extreme boredom, or an addictive personality, but after the first time you post you will ineveitably come crawling back.  No need to catch up, its been 2.5 years since the last post, but not much has changed.  Maybe this is proof that I need to get a job.  Man it's weird to type again, I havn't actually typed in years.  The only things that I do type are the wretched papers that I turn into Dean, which are mostly copy and paste sparknotes articles, but I try. Well the State of the Union speech was particularly moving.  I've decided to hold an American flag whenever he speaks and raise it whenever I hear the words ""freedom"" or ""liberate"".

I got called down to the Dean's office today.  Apparently he and Mrs. Starke are cracking down 
on affection in school.  SO now I am only allowed to hold Dorothy's hand. Please. Its not like we sit there and make out. Why is a guy hugging his girlfriend in school considered a serious offense. Perhaps they should focus on actual problems, like the curriculem of this pathetic pen of disgsuting in-bred farm animals.  This sad excuse for a school has less to offer than African war tribes when it comes to education. No instead lets call Asaf Shahar down to the office and tell him that he shouldn't hug his girlfriend in school.

"event","So I think people got out what they wanted to say. I think. And I know that everybody wants this to end. So I propose The Treaty of Tate. This Treaty officialy condemns the use of cacti for sexual pleasure. It also free's the slaves. And more importantly..

I believe that everything can work out. I think many people have random conflicts with other people. But that is to be expected when there are so many people who hang out together(note my crafty avoidance of the word group).  I know that we all share at least the same basic interests as friends, And we are definitely different than everybody else. I think that we oly have each other and we can not aford to mess that up. So I everybody just chill. Hang out with who you are comfortable with, dont backstab, and if someone is doing something that you are against, either talk to them about it inoffensively, or dont participate. I know that if we try all these issues will work out. I want to be able to all get together again. I am not saying we all need to be in one room talking to each other, although thats a nice (idealistic) thought. But I do believe on the other hand, that we dont have to divide into predetermined little groups.  I want to hang out with everybody. I also would like to apolagize to the people that were hurt through this ordeal. Namely you Casey. I'm hoping you and I can talk more about this if you still feel angry about it. Anyway, thats enough of that. I love you guys and you know that. I'll be the first to uncock my pistol and throw it down *clank*. I suggest everyone does.

"event","::Begins by fighting with live journal to not go to an error screen. This most likely prompted by neglect and ridicule of livejournal. After 3 or 4 good kicks, livejournal begins to function.::

well lets see. I've sort of explained my viewpoints to random people who weer interested. But I havn't said anything to everyone collectively. So logically I picked the thing I hate most to do it with. So lets start with the basic conflict. There is entirely too much child porn on the internet. Wait.....no thats not it. Ah..yes.  Friday. I was up in Indy and unaware of the conflict. So from what I hear, please feel free to correct me if i'm wrong, Nathan and Christine and Sydney decided that it would be fun to talk about Adrian and how pathetic he is behind his back. He heard and he got mad. I also here that one of the reasons of this labeling was that Adrian, Cody, and Sam all decided to get drunk. So I guess the other people thought this was a very stupid thing to do. Okay. That makes so much sense coming from you people. Especially you Nathan. not so long ago you were drinking and smoking and it was all fun for you. But now I can see you are above that and the people that do it. So I have to wonder.....what do you actually feel. When your around Cody, Me, Sam etc. its cool for you to do that stuff. But when your fellow colleague Steve is around, you are so very strongly against it. Please explain. Christine, from what I understand your just being a hippocrit. Casey, I don't know what you have to do with anything, but whatever. Sam made a joke in the library one day that, sadly, had a lot of truth to it. I dont care how much above social cliches you think you are, there is a definite pattern to all of your conversations. Nathan really is the center of everything. I stopped sitting with you guys at lunch because I am actually interested to hear waht other people, besides Nathan and Steve and definitely Casey, have to say. I think most of the time your conversations bore me to the point of leaving anyway. I think its bullshit that there is only like 2-3 main people to talking in a 10-12 person conversation. Steve my problem with you is correlated to this. When you are around me and Trey, you are a completely different perosn. If Trey or I wanted to be your partner in any class, and Nathan is there, there is no chance. And you only listen to each other when you are having this overly analytiacl conversations. If Trey or I or anybody wanted to talk to one of you guys, you blatently ignore us. And then Steve, when its just you me and Trey. You want to laugh or whatever, so you make fun of Nathan and his way of acting to talk to us. Its such crap. I think you two need to get married and go have a nice argument for the rest of your lives about something you dont actually care about. I want to be able to talk to you guys and not worry about how intelligent I sound. Adrian, your conversation with Casey was exagerated heavily and stupidly put. nevertheless your my friend. And so is Sam. You may have been prompted by the people who dont know you to leave our ""group"". Well you know what? Fuck our group. If it comes down to this bullshit, then fuck it all the way. I am not going to give up any of my friends ever, but I will not be a part of some club for the pretentious assholes of WVHS. I guess all I really want is for everybody to be themselves (at least to each other), and to stop this backstabbing bullshit. I dont think everyone has to be friends but I will not let some mock civil war to happen. Please feel free to comment and criticize this post. I want to hear what you have to say. I'm not mad at anyone. I'm just frustrated. Good nightr and happy history"

Got back today from my brothers wedding and my house is full of relatives.  The wedding really was very nice. I mean there was a lot of hokey conversation with some of the people I dont know so well but I got used to it. I drank way way too much. I hung out with Katie's brother Dave. He's my age and we both got tanked about halfway through the reception. So after our parents said no more we just started mixing our own. We drank more back at the hotel too. Yeah I slept good that night. Didn't feel so good this morning though.  Its so good to be home though. Dorothy and I havn't had much time to spend with each other lately and I miss her like crazy.

So Nathan are you fucking those Japs or what?

I've decided that Alicia Keyes is the most attractive female celebrity ever. But unfortunately what comes out of her mouth isn't as pretty. Oh well no one asked her speak.

Undressed has to be one of the worst television shows MTV has ever aired.

top 5 Games that look interesting(PS2)
1. SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals
2. Mortal Combat: Deadly Alliance
3. Red Faction 2
4. James Bond: Night Fire
5. Red Dead Revolver(very ify, I just have never seen a 3D country western game) 

I more than likely wont get any of these but there are a ton that I am not thinking about which may be good. Sony finally got off its ass and gave me some real games to think about.

top 5 best quotes from the wedding.

5. ""See Asaf when you go to college, its like, cool ya know. Cause now in high school i'm sure your havin fun ya know, but college, is fun and I mean.....what was it I was saying?""

4. ""Oh you just sprouted up like a weed since the last time I've seen you Asaf."" ""Who smokes weed""?                                                - Mary Padgett, Dave Padgett

3. ""Well ya know what I say? fuck him.""

"event","Oh where do I start. I probably should of posted right after I got back from camp, but I was too lazy. Livejournal seems like a distant memory. But I think I will start posting again. 

So camp, all of you droogies have asked me how it was, but I just give you the superficial crap. I guess I should really talk about it. But dont expect it to be very long or interesting or useful.

Camp was very very very good. My friends there are so wonderful. I dont think you guys would find them particulary interesting. They dont read books, they dont see ""great films"". they dont use words that mean the same thing as shorter words but make you sound smarter. They dont argue about politics or society. They dont really do anything. I'm not trying to say that they are better for it, they are just different. Camp is like the most unstressful thing in the world. We just sit and talk about shit and run around yelling and compare penis sizes. No joke. Its refreshing to be so completely and utterly comfortable around people. Like I never have to catch myself saying something stupid or whatever. 

The first time I talked to Nathan on the phone after camp he wanted to know if anything drastic happened. I couldn't think of anything on the spot. And I now realize there isn't anything drastic. Its all much more suttle. I've lost a lot of my violent tendences. I cant enjoy stupid action movies at all. And I dont feel very much aggresion anymore. Its not like i'm a pacifist or some dumb shit like that. Its just weird. Dorothy has a lot to do with all this. She has helped make me feel more human. I dont necessarily feel like i've matured though. Its just I dont get enjoyment from conflict anymore. And I am really really sick of lying. I mean like extremely. I just hate it. I dont care if people see how flawed of a person I am. I just dont want to lie anymore. 

I really want to learn. I mean about everything. I want to start reading again. I want to see lots of movies. I really like physics. I want to learn about physics. I want to learn more about philosphy. And I really really want to learn more about music. Since school started the only hobby i've really put effort towards learning a lot about is cars. And I do really really love cars. But I am at the point where I am satisfied with the amount of knowledge I possess about them. I want to be able to participate in conversations about music and film and stuff knowing more about whats being talked about. I really want to do good in school this year. Like I really do. I hate getting bad grades. And i'm sick of cheating. I really do want to learn. 

I cant really say what I want to say with this thing. But I am doing the best I can. I'm sorry if I am jumping around a lot. But I feel comfortable that way. Okay time for some randomness.

MINORITY REPORT is my favorite movei of the summer. That futuristic stuff is so interesting to me. I need to see A.I. like now. The thing is about that movie is that as a whoole the plot was kinda lame. I mean the precrime concept was cool. But I mean come on, little kids whose parents shot up heroin so as a result they are precognitive. Doesn't seem like that would be the result. But it was the screenplay and special effects that made me like it so much. The way Cruise moved his hands when he was searching through those futre crime records and stuff. That was cool.

Has anybody else but me heard of Dispatch? I like them a lot. Download ""The General"" if you have time.

Politics....hmmm....not interesting

Bowflex infomercials...hmm...not interesting...but more interesting than politics

I don't like guns very much anymore

I am exercising a lot now. I feel better when I am healthy. 

I've decided that I respect The Big Tymers a.k.a Cash Money Millionaires a.k.a. Hot Boyz just becuase of their honesty. They are completely in the music industry for the money and they dont pretend to have talent that isn't there. They accept the fact that they will not be in the spotlight for long and I dont think they really care as long as they have money. I mean I cant stand their music or their lifestyle but at least they practice what they preach.

5. 2003 Corvette ZO6  ($50,000)
4. 1997 Mclaren F1   ($1,200,000)

2. 2001 BMW M5 ($65,000)

Inncidently the case has been dismissed  because of recent events concerning a matter envolved with Enron employee Mark Smith who claims to have been attacked by the CEO's pet alligator Muffie. ""I couldn't see it Coming"", says Smith, who was attacked by while entertaining a few of his muslim friends from Afghanistan. ""The thing might of killed me if Samir hadn't of had an AK-47 handy to blow its head off.""..... Abraham Lincoln is now confirmed to have been a women. The only question remains is was John Wilks Booth his jilted lover?......A new drug has just been developed by Eli Lily that rivals Phizers Viagra. The drug is called Hammerhead. Hammerhead is proven to not only prevent erectile disfunction, but also to enlarge penis size by 46%. The drug is set for release in march and may become the leading perscreption drug of the century.......Should the U.S. torture terror Detainees!?, do I care!?.......MEAT!.......Tina Barrett in the emergency room this week for semen overdose. Their is a large semen build up in her throat which disables her ability to speak correctly and may eventuly cause the esophagus to fail. Apparently she's been sucking too many dicks.... Steve Degroote gets a hand job from an underocder police officer posing as a frnch whore. He will serve a minimum sentance of 12 years federal prison... what a moron........America rivals the new popular form of Japanese entertainment Anime with their new line of fanime. fanime is like anime only it is completely written by fans.

Ah so little to say and so much time to do it. 

Ah I went to Wisconsin to go dogsledding over the triple weekend. It really was a shit load of fun. I went with Cody and like 8 juniors from our school. They arew great guys who have so little interest in anything remotely important it makes me laugh. I smoked a whole pack of smokes in one night, Drank 3 screwdrivers and even took a few dips of chew. Which was not outstandingly enjoyable. Wow all those tars and carcinogens don't rest to nicely inmy lungs and I can't exactly swim the best right now but hey, life sucks, die young. The motto of a true moron like me.

Math, math glorius math.

No ammunition no firing squad.

I have no true perception of the constant flow of knowledge that surrounds me. I make half-hearted attempts to gain some foot-hole in this vast chamber of knowledge but in actuality I can't grasp it's true significance. I just sit here and isolate myself from my parents plotting the deaths of all that I dislike. I hate so many things it's starting to tear my mind apart. I grit my teeth in anguish for all that eats at my insides. my gears. My gears and bolts are starting to bend and twist . The system is failing and soon I will have no choice in what I do. I will eventually give up on all that I believe in becuase I lack the perserverance to fight for it. I will become a tool for the government. I will do their work for them. I will set an example to the rest of humanity on how they should act and what they should believe. I will- become so primitive that I will resemble an ape. I will be no longer a being, just a piece. A piece of something so perfect and uniform that any other way would seem ludacrous.

"event","Hello everyone, I am Asook Shahook

I have hacked into the main computer of the ship's hyperboard.

And that was Mr. Tidd. Who would like to attack the squirrels who live in the basement? I would. Quick summon the townfolk, we're going on a crusade!

Wait a moment...I hear someone outside...Oh phew it is the men from the Councillate.

top ten things I like,
10.TATE
9.MONKEYS
8.BANANAS
7.GLOBAL WARMING
6.COPS
5.POPCORN SHRIMP
4.BOB VILLA
3.BENNY GOODMAN
2.WALTER MATTHAU
1.FAX MACHINES

The Councillate says that I shouldn't be writing on the hyperboard with a blue crayon.

So anyway after coming back from my escapade to the grocery store to get shoelaces for 1/2 off I retired to my layer and read the top 100 books on Operas Bookclub.

So I used the yellow one.

Kyle Tidd dead today, he was eaten by a pack of wolves. He was...delicious.

They say no crayons so I whipped out my markers.

(.)(.)<------------ BREASTS!

The Councillate carried me out onto the Scout Ship.

So I hear if you stick a beer can up a chickens ass before you cook it it locks in the flavor.

I still have my red crayon.

hey stop biting!

I started writing on the guards face whilst he was sleeping.

If you roll bowling balls at old ladies just to watch them fall down chances are your going to hell. 

He woke up when I got to his nose and he...Oh, what's the word...

Seize the day! call now, 50% off everything!!!!!!!!!

Shot me.

So I was walking down the street one day when I saw this large scou ship crash through my neighbors house and A young boy with a hole in his leg ran out of it. Behind him came a guard with crayon all over his face and the only thing that passed through my head is what Mr. Smith was going to do when he came back from Florida and saw his house.

I walked onto the ship's steeringdeck and turned on the television.  They were selling Kitchen utensils on QVC.

OH NO ITS THE MASTADON OF DOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think I might go make some spaghetti.

Sydney I just want to take this time to thank you, thank you for making my life miserable and being so attractive. I wish I really wish I didn't still feel anything for you because that is completely pointless and stupid. So I hope you have fun with your new open-minded real friends.

Dustin, I dont exactly know whats going on, but from what I hear your being quite the ass. But thats okay because your online friends will take care of you right? I am not going to go to sleep to night worrying about any of this. Dustin your one of my best friends and I love you, but dont treat me like someone who is just a back up.

"event","Well yeat another auseme night has passed. This time it was just me Sydney Dustin and Gina. It was a cuddle fest. we all needed it because school sucks so much. Friday night and morning really just sucked. Really sucked. We went to the crappy football game and did nothing. Went to Chicagos and of course Steve Nathan Casey and Kile went off away from me Sydney and Dustin( and Cody). The group now is plitting into two and sides are being chosen Honestly I feel a hell of a lot more comfortable around my new group than my old group. My friends, there auseme, but they all act like they know everything, I mean seriously they are smart but Nathan always talks down to everybody and really doesn't accept opinons very well because he assumes his is always right. I dont like that and I dont need it. So we were at Chicagos and I joined my 4 best guy friends for an eventful night of absolute boredom. I didn't take my drums and I am glad. We didn't do anything. ANd are band, is going nowhere. But I dontc are its a neat hobby. So then Saturday I built a barn and went to Dustins house. Ah. Extasy. That was auseme. I was hugging Sydney 90% of the time i was there and we were all just huggin and cuddling and being happy. It was really nice. Nobody talked down to anybody and we could have a good conversation even if we dont talke about deeply philosophicalsubject. We could just talk and be comfortable and just love each other. Sydney and I kissed. like really kissed. And it meant something. It meant more than just any stupid kiss. We didn't do it out of prssure it just happened and it was easy and nice. I also kissed Dustin, and Gina. But thats another story. Thats what I mean, I cant be around Steve and Nathan like that because they are so non touchy feeley. They just talk. And they always act so open minded yet showing affection for a friend of the same sex is automatically gay. Bastards. I dont care what they think. Dustin at least understands that guys dont have to be gay if they touch each other. So it was wonderful. we basically did nothing. Watched a little anime, listen to a little music, I even got allowance of 1/4 a cup of whiskey mixed with coke. It was nice but I didn't quite read the label and realize that it was 80 proof. I'm paying for that now. stomach cramps of the worst kind. My brother
instantly smelled it on my breath when I got back and gave me a lecture about it. but you know what he did it to so he can lecture me all he wants but he is just being a hippocrit. Kyle is cool. Melissa is not cool. I think that eventually our group will begin to drift more and more. I really dont feel like spending the night at my guy friends houses any more unless its Dustin. They are just so....distant. I dont know. Steve and I are very close but lately he has been implanted in Nathans as and has not really seen my poin of view of anything. It sucks but If thats ow he feels thats how he feels. Gina got a little depressed at 10:20 or so so I took off all my clothes for her. I think that may of made her cry even more but at least she was smiling. I like Bunny a lot. He can be cool and deep without being superior. He shouldn't hate himself at all, but I am glad he doesn't think his superior. Becasue when we talk it always very comfortable and we never argue..about anything serious.(PS2 forever you loyal Nintendo bastard.) Sydney and I are amazingly cuddely and comfortable around each other. I think that just us 4 together was really nice. I am always so happy when I am around her. She is great. If I could see everybody ( Dustin, Gina, Sydney, Megan,) at least once a weekend my life would be good. I see Sydney and Dustin at school, but they aren't the same as when they are out of school. arghh fuck leaf projects suck. I hate the damn it. Damn you Jackson. Ah who cares. I love cars. Obsessively. Its disgusting. I love them and want them. I need all cars. Damn it i need a BMW. They X5 maybe. That is such an auseme SUV. But For now I will due with my rusty old Toyota pick-up. WE ARE GETTING AN SUV. Finally me and my dad and mom finally agreed on the Acura MDX. Its auseme. It is huge so we can haul people, objects, dogs around everywhere. It is comfortable. It's got all the baells and whisteles including a TV which will save my life during road trips. Plus its got a really nice engine and is all together very reliable. I cant wait. Mu hahahahaha. God my head hurts. time for aspirin/bed combo. Bye"

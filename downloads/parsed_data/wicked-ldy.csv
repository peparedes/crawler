"event","This week has been pretty crazy. First, I got a call last wednesday from Alta Vista - where I've been working as a P.A. for about a year now - and was informed that starting the next day I would be the casting director for a Yoplait commercial. Fun, fun, fun. Of course they said they would train me, but the training pretty much consisted of ""Here's the computer, Good luck."" I've done it before but only for school projects, nothing in the ""real world."" So, although it's been lots of fun I was under a lot of stress because of course, i wanted to make the best impression. Everything went well. Tomorrow will be the last day of casting and the commercial will be shot on April 3rd. 
Because I needed someone to do camera and to edit, I called up my friend Lee, who happens to be my best friend Melissa's boyfriend/ex-boyfriend. Lee and I really like to hang out with each other, but don't do it that often because for some stupid reason, Melissa gets really jealous. 
Well, for about five days now, Lee and I have been spending maybe too much time together. He's the first person i see when i wake up and the last one when i go to sleep. It's been a little weird, but I've had lots of fun. We seem to have bonded... he's been through a lot for someone that's the same age as me. It's always nice to listen to his stories. 
The only problem is that Melissa got really upset the first time we had to spend the night together in the office 'cuz we were going to edit. The real reason we decided to have a ""sleep over"" is because he was pretty sad because she had just broken up with him. Seeing him sad made me sad... because i know exactly how it feels. So I tried to cheer him up... by getting him drunk!!! yaaaay! So Melissa called me the next day and yelled at me over the  phone for spending time with him and not telling her. WTF!!! I was pissed off. I haven't talked to her since, even though she later apologized... but I just wanted time so that when i talk to her i won't be all mad and say things that could hurt her. You know me, I sure can be a bitch when i'm upset. So much drama... i hate girls. 
Well, that's it... i haven't slept much and i'm probably a little delirious by now... the fact that i'm listening to hippie 60s music doesn't help much..."

"event","There's this guy at work that I really hate. He's always telling me that I look sad and that everyone he's talked to says that I look sad. WTF? Why is he talking about me to other people? I keep telling him ""I'm not sad, leave me alone."" But he just keeps bugging!!! He keeps insisting that I be happy and smile. The other day i felt like yelling at him: ""I'm not sad, i'm just mad because i have to work with a stupid jerk like you!"" I was so mad, I threw a quarter at him. Only because I had a quarter in my hand, if I'd had a gun in my hand i would've probably shot him. Really, I'm not sad. I don't know what his problem is. Maybe because I'm at work and I just look serious? But anyways... I really hate him. He's always happy and talking about being positive. He's like SUPER happy. That makes me hate him even more. 
It turns out that he's bipolar. And he's on medication. He's happy all the time because he's on happy pills. This is a true fact and i'm not making it up."

"event","I haven't posted anything in a while. I think i'm getting lazy. Or maybe i've been too busy. Probably both. 
February has been an interesting month. I had a party about 2 weeks ago. Lots of people, lots of alcohol, lots of fun. By the end of the night i was drunk, standing out in the rain, having a conversation with God. He never answers, but it's fun talking to him when you're drunk...
This month I finally realized that the person i've been waiting for all my life does not exist. That sucked. But I guess I won't be waiting for anyone anymore. I don't know if that's good or not. 
I've also been thinking a lot about Death. Don't worry, I'm not suicidal or anything like that... that all belongs to my teenage years. I've been thinking about Death because i've almost been in a car accident three times this month. I've come to the conclusion that if I was to die right now, i'd go in peace. I did a lot of the things i wanted to do, I've been in love at least once, I have no regrets, and the things i didn't get to do... well, maybe they weren't that important. But I know I still have lots of things to do and I'm looking forward to them. 
This month I also started walking everyday and trying to eat healthy. I'd like to take up yoga or maybe dance classes... something fun. We'll see how long that lasts. Without really noticing it, i started smoking again and i've been doing a lot of drinking... I guess there always has to be a balance between good and evil. 
That's all for now."

"event","Yesterday sucked. Being a supervisor is not much fun... i really hate playing bad cop and having to babysit a bunch of irresponsible adults. Because that's what i did all day. I hate having to look for people that dissappear and don't work, i hate having to constantly remind people of the uniform standards, and i hate telling them something and getting the answer: ""well, you're the only one that's said anything."" like if I say it it doesn't really matter and it's ok to keep doing it. WTF??? I was really frustrated last night... but i feel better today. I guess i'll just have to learn to deal with it, not take things personal and find a balance between friendship and business... 
I like club soda. It's bubbly and it goes ""fzzzzz""

I used to go everytime i was upset or confused, or just needed a break from life. Tonight I really feel like driving out there and spending the night, waiting for the sun to come up... but i'm a wuss now and i probably won't do it. First, because i'm really scared of spending the night there by myself, and second because i don't really know anyone that would care to go with me... *sighs*"

Last night i just thought everyone was hungry and that's why we were all leaving at the same time. Apparently Eel got kicked out three times, but he kept coming back... Last night Eel and I became spit brother and sister... it was pretty slimmy. I have his saliva all over my skirt. He had mine all over his pants. 
We also picked up a stranger at that bar. We gave him a ride home. He did not murder us as i suspected he would."

Today I joined a gang. My gang is the roughest. We're going camping. But we call it bootcamp because we'll be wearing boots. These are my peeps: Bounce Grrrl, D-Dough and Eel. They call me T-kat (short for Titty Kat). D-Dough and Eel don't know they're part of our gang. Bounce Grrrl is afraid that if we tell them, they'd wanna drop out. Then we'd have to kill them. 
Bounce Grrrl wants to be a rock when she grows up. That way she'll never have to worry about anything. She's neat.

Sometimes I can't stop giggling... and then there's times when i feel like crying for no apparent reason. I wonder if I'm the only person in the planet that has these crazy mood swings... or maybe everyone feels like this sometimes. Maybe they're not mood swings at all and that's just the way it's supposed to be. Tomorrow will be a full moon. That could be the cause to all this craziness. Or maybe i just work too much and i'm too tired and stressed out. Maybe i'm just overanalizing everything because instead of getting some sleep i'm sitting here, thinking about everything and nothing at all..."

"event","Sometimes, it happens that you break up with someone and you're still in love with them. For six months, you'll cry over this person. You'll think about him/her everyday. Every stupid song that plays on the radio reminds you of them. You'll stop yourself several times from calling that person when you miss them the most, after all, it's not like the bastard has even bothered to call you. But then, it so happens, that about six months after you break up, in the middle of the night, He/she calls you. Sometimes they're drunk. They'll cry on the phone and tell you how much they miss you. How everyday they think about you, and how every stupid song on the radio reminds them of you. And it's then that you realize you don't really care about this person at all.

Six months is what it should take you to get over someone. More than that is just not healthy. Anything less than six months... uhmm... quit lying to yourself, you still love them."

"event","I hate the way I feel lately. I hate what I said to Matt the other night too. I thought it would help me but it didn't. I told him I wanted to be alone this weekend, I encouraged him to go to Cali and to NJ, and I told him that we would figure out the living situation. Not true. I didn't want to be alone this weekend, I want to go to Cali and NJ WITH him and I want to continue this living situation as boyfriend and girlfriend, as it should be.

I still don't know where we stand because he hasn't officially said that we are or are not together, so I don't know. 


I'm so confused, lonely...


I just want Matty back. The Matty I love and had 8.5 AMAZING years with. The one that was there for me thought EVERYTHING

I dont want to start over with anyone else, there is no one else. I don't want him with anyone else. There isn't anyone else.

I want to go to the banquet, go to Lake George, go camping, go to OBX, spends my days and nights with him....


I can't help but blame myself. What did I do wrong? Why can't I be loved in return?

Why is it that everything I love leaves me unexpectedly?"

"event","As much as this hurts and I never thought he'd put me through pain like this. I can't stop thinking about the Jason Mraz song and how PERFECT it is. I WONT GIVE UP

""I Won't Give Up""

Hmmmm ... Hmmmm ... Hmmmm ... Hmmm ...

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up.

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"

"event","What an adventurous day yesterday! Ther are many things that I learned for my future trips to Six Flags. But then I also had an awesome day because we so devirginized sarah and rollercoasters! Which was the funniest thing ever!

The No List:
1. Wear sandals, you'll get denied on your first ride
2. Wear light khaki pants, a thong and go on a water ride because you might actually get stuck under a waterfall...
3. Dont waste your money on Carny games when your going to the fair the next day
4. Play the carny games last so you dont have to carry your animals around all day

The Yes List:
1. Bring a change of clothes or bathing suit
2. Wear shoes
3. Buy a Z-bot so you can cut in line
4. Bring more than 60$


Things that made my day:
1. Sitting with two crazy men on the white water rafting ride
2. Sarahs pictures when we got off the rollercoasters
3. Robert and I winning an animal FIRST! but then its NOT cool when lesley wins a big ass monkey off of sarahs money
4. Minor detour on the way there and on the way home...
5. Falling asleep in Mass and waking up in Albany
6. Passing Kinderhook ;)
7. Getting out of Voorheesville for a day
8. Spitting water out on Sarah because sarah made me laugh so hard in line for the Batman
9. Moose enjoying Frogdor


Probably so much more but I can't think of it right now because I just got distracted majorly...

Anyways I gotta go shower, me and Sar are going to the FAIR!

Catch ya'll later kiddies..."

Oh yes and my nap from my house to the office was quite nice... yet my father making fun of me for that was not cool...


umm ps. taking love advice from a 5 year old is very sad.. but he was right on the button.. i didnt ask for it i swear, he openly commented, and it was so true, i shouldve... damn it all!

"event","Oh wow... So last night after playing a few rounds of some hot poker up at Sarahs, I went home to finish my paper. I also was waiting for Amie to come over because she had no place to stay and I said she could stay with me if she needed to, which she did. So after some major procrastination, and only one page down, i finally got going and finished up my paper by midnight. Amie and I then put in Butterfly Effect. Yes that would have been the third night in a row that I watched it... But that was the whole point. I was soo tired so I wasnt too upset that I had to watch it again, plus it is a very good movie. 

But anyways, the entertaining part of this was when I actually fell asleep, I started TALKING in my sleep. I remember it though, which is odd. Amie was cracking up going Katie, omg Katie. And I'm like yeah, the bear. and I'm like woah wait a minute, looking around not seeing who i was ""talking"" to. Apparently I was telling Sarah to take and hold my bear because she likes it (my niece likes it). And Sarah wasnt taking it or didnt understand so I kept saying ""here the bear"" 

Yeah def. dont ever want to sleep with anyone in the room ever again.


On that note, I am going back to work... only a few more hours, thank god!"

Hmm, things I've done today...
1. Bitch work for the morning
2. Broke the stapler
3. Almost stapled my finger (twice)
4. Slammed my knee on the corner of my desk drawer, and yes the drawer is underneath my desk... dont know how that one happened
5. Talked online to Matty, and just pictured him dancing and singing ""Its Peanut Butter Jelly Time"" that made my day complete
6. Almost got caught by my boss just now
7. Almost got caught by my boss while talking online
8. Looked at pictures of my niece that will soon be up on my website
9. COFFEE COOLATTA... he he he
10. Text messaging does so much...
11. Gotta love text messages to your best friend, saying you miss him and want to hang out and feel like he has to pencil you in to even hang out like we used to! :) I do miss him, I see him almost every day but its not the same! 

Its only 2:25 and i've done ALL of that... oh SO much! or not...but im hyper now...


*everyone has a secret, oh can they keep it? oh no they can't* i heart maroon 5.

I'm up for an adventure... I dont know what, but anything really... 


Why is it that when you finally find what your looking for there is NO WAY you can ever have it because it would just be wrong? I'm in that boat...

Why is it that basically i'm crazy for a guy who would never see me the way i would like him to? I'm in that boat...

Why is it that I always have this problem, and with either one I will not have success... so i'll basically end up alone with sarah and adam and the stray dogs adam brings home from animal control and the ONE cat I will allow sarah to have when she is on her deathbed, because i do not like cats for the life of me...

Anyways this is just babble now...Because I am ridiculously hyper, but it killed about 10 minutes... 

I'll see you kids later... Goodbye my loves..."

Today I have actually been working really hard, but my eyes are going all sorts of crazy so I needed a break. 

But as I was reading some journals just a few minutes ago, I was in the ""everything is directed towards me mood"" and well something hit a little too close to home and my good mood went to sad and i hate my life type mood. Tonight should be interesting. Considering I have like no friends now, I will probably be spending it alone, watching I love the 90's with Moose. Awesome. Gotta love life. Or not."

"event","So today was totally weird as was the rest of this weekend. I woke up probably around 1:15pm after falling asleep at midnight the night before. There is something wrong with sleeping in the sun while under the influence. It effects you for more than just that one day/night. After waking up and putzing around the house, I helped my father out around the house. After so much cleaning, I drove around downtown trying to find a place to grab something to eat on the go and then bring it down to the preserve while I write my paper. So after lots of driving, I went to Subway, got a sub and headed to the preserve. I got there and had about and hour and a half to write my paper before it got too dark to see. I was going to do something with Cait when she got out of work, but the sun and us being tired made us into major bums. So basically I just went online after coming home from writing my paper. Tomorrow I have work from 8am-430pm and then class from 5pm-9pm. Who knows what I'll do afterwards, well except for the fact that I WILL be watching I Love The 90's.  

Driving around today was nice, I got to think about a lot of things and came to some major realizations. Especially after writing my paper, which is about my mother, a lot of things came into place.

Around 8:30, while sitting at my desk my heart was racing, my sight was becoming blurry and I almost passed out so my boss let me leave and go home. So I slept til about 3 and then went to adams to help him out with his house, which looks soo good now. Then we went to the firehouse, because we had to pick up ben then go to houlihans because it was houlihans night. Well Adam was MIA at the time Ben was landing so butters cait and I went to go look for him and Adam was going to meet us, well we were looking for Ben, couldnt find him and found out that Adam came and left and was back at the firehouse. So Cait and I decided to take a TAXI to the Crossings because butters was picking up his girlfriend and we didnt feel like waiting. So from the Crossings Cait and I walked to the firehouse, just appearing and no one realizing where we came from. It was odd. So we went to Houlihans. It was me Cait, Denisa, Ben, Pikachu and Adam. Very small crew for a Houlihans night. Then we went back to the firehouse, waiting for Denisa because she was supposed to spend the night at Adams. Adam and I waited at Tito's til about 130 and decided that we needed to go home. 

Saturday, I woke up disgustingly early and ended up at Adams house around 6:55. We got to the firehouse to meet  Pikachu, Denisa and Cait to head up the Round Lake Firehouse to meet Butters and some of his friends to head up to countryfest. We ended up there around 9am. Pikachu and Adam were drunk at 9am. It was quite amusing. We drank for a whle in the parking lot, then went in. We all passed out in the sun and had spells of dehydration and what not. So there were multiple trips to the Clubhouse. Other than the fact that I was a lobster, felt disgusting at night, it was a great day... Minus one thing but we won't talk about that at this moment. 

So its Sunday and I just woke up, still feel like shit, and I really want things to work out... Who knows whats going on today... We'll see...

sorry for anyone who had to read that and it wasnt so interesting. But I could vent, but I'm not going to...

Talk to you kids later...


PS: CAIT I HEART YOU! FEEL BETTER BABE!"

"event","So, at this point, I think I may be moving out and living on my own, just me myself and moose... Anyone want to join in this party let me know? 


Amanda is truely frustrating me with this whole thing. I am totally motivated to leave, but she doesnt seem like she is. I think she has her niche and likes where she is. Im ready to get the hell out of my house. Especially after today when my dad yelled at me for no reason... 


So big decision for me...

live alone?
find another roomie?

what do you think?"

Once again, life sucks. I woke up around 430am after going to bed around 2am, it wa like de ja vu from the previous night. Instead of letting the dogs outside, I kicked them out of my room, 530 rolls around and I let them outside, then all of a sudden 730 rolls around... I overslept! My dad comes down as hes leaving and woke me, yet I fell back asleep for like 20 more mins. Woke up finally, showered, took my time, emailed my boss and said I'd be in around 10. Pulling out of my court and my car stalls. AWESOME! Pull out of my development, car stalls. As I said before, AWESOME! I finally get to work around 1015. Sit down, and i realize now I have been here for about an hour and a half and I want to go home, and go to bed, but nope, thats not in the plan right now.

Also, I've been thinking a lot lately. Especially about this past weekend. Saturday night, I regret something I did, big time regret. Yet, I can fix it, which is good. I just have to promise myself I will never do it again. It messed me up last semester and I want to become my Oober-nerd again this year, not Oober-slacker. I'm positive I can do this though.  There are things I wish I could take back, but there are also things, on which I wish I did more with. But I guess it was all meant to happen that way. We'll see where everything goes.

I'm looking forward to Saturday, minus one thing, one thing I know I'll see and it'll def. bother me a lot, yet I can't do anything about! SWEET! Just my luck... Ok, this venting needs to stop before I say something I don't want people to know...

ttyl kids.



but I keep running
I am running
I keep living for the day that I'm with you
and I am waiting
I am waiting
I keep waiting for the day that I'm with you

as long as this sun is burning
now it seems that all I want is you

I still feel the same
though everything has changed
the pain it cost now 
I feel lost inside of my own name








stand. climb. and fall."

So lately, things have been amazingly awkward. I honestly can say I hate when I am in situations like these. But I basically put myself there so we'll see how this one pans out...

For some odd reason my right calf and super tight... anyone want to massage it? lol jp...

Um yeah, random things, sorry...

But yeah, me being up and talking to people right now just gets them mad at me so I'm going to stop at this exact moment....

MATTY - I'll be looking for you online tomorrow between the hours of 8am and 430pm! I need my buddy to talk to!

"event","Wow, today is def. an interesting day already and its only 940am. So, starting off the day at 445am was quite interesting, apparently moose wanted to play then, but I was in no mood so I locked her out of my room, yet she punished me by going to the bathroom downstairs so there was a nasty odor when I woke up at my normal time. Well, normal time after I hit the alarm 2 times. Not wanting to get up because today was going to be the longest day ever, I did and hopped in the shower. I took my time this morning because my dad was up already and we werent fighting for the bathroom, which is always nice. Yet, I was late to work because I couldnt fine my schedule for my class tonight on where my class was. But after some time, I found it and left 10 minutes later than normal and ended up to be 10 minutes late. Yet, no one noticed because everyone is in a big meeting, that has been going on since 8am. I finished all my work yesterday, one of my boss's is inthe meeting, and the other is in another meeting. So I've been searching online for random things, and found out about stuff for Soccer in the Fall. I am so excited. August 16th can't come any sooner! I'm just nervous because I'm in decent shape, but thats 3 weeks of preseason... ehh, pain! I think I'm going to start running 3 times a week, maybe like 2-3 miles each time, and then increase it as time passes, so I'll be able to run a full soccer game,which I think is equivalent to 8 miles. I can't remember... OK, I'll probably be writing more later in boredom..."

"event","Last night when I got home I think I was in such shock that I couldnt write anything about what Me Matt and Sarah did....

We ended up going to Pinewood (Forest Park) Cemetery in Troy NY. This cemetery is known to be one of the top 10 haunted places in the nation. There were only 3 of us, unlike last time, where there were 7.

OK, so...Matts never been and I've only been in the front section and Sarah was there maybe a year ago. So we took Mattto the ""bleeding statue"" and then decided to take some paths to go find other stuff, like the inferno. First off, a lot of trees had fallen so there were basically ""detours"", but after a lot of walking and hearing a lot of creepy noises, we ended up back at that statue! We made a huge loop...So we're like ok lets go the other way... Yeah, we ended up at a dead end! We were not happy with our sense of direction at this point, because we were lacking it. So we decided to get back to the statue or the area of the statue and go find some more things the other way... well as we are walking on the path, we were just shining the flashlights, looking for gravestones, tombs, etc, just anything really.  Then Matt goes what is that, and I shined the flashlight on the ground, and im like oh its just a bandana, not thinking anything of it and hes like it looks like its new and I'm like maybe its those kids we saw before (because as we were going in, some kids were leaving), and he decided to kick it over, and none-the-less what is underneath it? a BLOODY BAG with like Gluton residue on it and ants crawling all over it and the bandana was soaked in blood and then this digusting smell of dead animal came across and at that point we were like OK, we are leaving now. We actually I said that because I was totally creeped out and we booked it out of there as fast as we could. Then we were walking up to the car, and it started to rain, because well, yeah, we're so smart, we go to one of the Top Ten Haunted Places in the Nation during a lightning storm. So that was my night, and I def. had trouble falling asleep because every time I shut my eyes, I saw that bag! I wish we looked at it more, or took my camera in so we could have proof of all this. Oh well, next time...

Back to work.... more later."

"event","OK this live journal shit is majorly addicting! I can't stop! haha

I told Sarah this was going to be interesting, but ehh, idk if I'm truely in the mood to write a lot... 

But I feel that everyone should appreciate my dream that I had last night. I spark noted it for Andy and Sarah, but here is the whole thing... All like 5 lines but yeah you get the point...

So I'm down in DC with CJ and Matt and we're visiting Cait. And Cait decided to take us on a tour of DC. And I'm like oh wow I want to see the White House. So of course we end up going to the White House. Then all of a sudden, remember this is a dream, we are inside the White House, talking to Bush and Bush decks CJ! They start fighting, going at it, and the secret service guys are just standing watching. And then Matt goes CJ, it'll be fine, Katie is my girlfriend now, don't worry about it. And then I woke up. I was like WOAH OK... need to stop watching documentaries before I go to bed, um also need to stop thinking of CJ before going to bed, and the fact that there is major seperation anxiety, hence cait's role in the dream. I dont know how matt appeared but it might of been because I was wearing his sweatshirt to the movie... I dont know. Random, but yes please appreciate that.

So I'm going to leave now...gnight


PS: DMB IN 4 DAYS! Hopefully not going alone... :-/"

"event","Honestly, could my life get any worse? Um yeah, it does, about every fuckin day this past week or so... But there are def. some highlights ;)

Bad List:
1. Def. not cool to be rushing to work and contemplating all day if you should call in or not, and not even be on the schedule
2. Butters knowing you better than you know yourself and you've only met maybe 3 times
3. Going to your nieces brunch and finding out that your grandfather who has diabetes and two different types of cancer is actually getting worse and has spent most of his time in NY in bed
4. Awkward ride home this morning, but it was kinda nice, in a weird way
5. Boys are trouble.
6. Seperation Anxiety.
7. Crossword puzzles, especially when you say what it is and then change it or be like no that can't fit. but thats just stupidity there
8. ebfcbff?
9. Still sick and not sure what it truely is and actually reading side effects and having a good portion of them but have not called the doctor yet about them... interesting eh?

Good List:
1. Finally saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and just happened to run into Bob and Matt Watson
2. Layed out in the sun and did crosswords, which i will admit, are hard!
3. Speaking...
4. Countryfest is in T-minus 14 days.
5. Niece is ONE tomorrow!
6. DMB on friday... Don't know if he still wants to come though... Id like him to, so if your reading this, Id like you to go still with me


Ok so more bad than good, but I have a feeling things'll start looking up... I hope so at least... Ive had it bad enough... BUT can't complain so much because I've been through worse... as hard as that may be to believe because I'm such a complainer right now... yeah def have had worse.

Anyways, this kid is off to bed, even though I can't sleep...

Is it bad that the only thing that can put you to sleep are your own tears or alcohol?

gnight chillins..."

"event","So, as basically no one really knows, my brother was in the hospital for his heart this past week. He was supposed to have tests done Friday afternoon, but apparently was ""too busy"" to see the doctor. I honestly know him very well, and know that he is scared, and well that scares me. He isn't afraid of a lot, except until now. I mean 25 years old, your not supposed to have tests done to your heart or even have the chance of having a heart attack. It really scares me alot. No one in my family needs stuff like this to happen again. It's bad enough that we lost our mother/wife/daughter etc. Like I know hes scared and I totally understand that, because if I was in his position I would be too. But I really want him to actually have the tests done. He rescheduled it for Tuesday, so we'll know more then. But he's acting like nothing is going on. I mean today he was helping me and dad out with the shed and next weekend hes going to help me paint... I dont know if I can say anything to him because if he knows I'm worried about him, that could scare him more. I love him, hes my brother but I am very scared for him. I hope all works out for the good, but right now, everything is up in the air, and I hate it... But on that note, i'll let ya'll know more later when he actually gets these tests done.. Hopefully it'll be good news, but we'll see... 


Secondly, no more drama please! and grow the FUCK up!


I'm out though, off to K-Mart with Sar... haha awesome, good times:)"

"event","So today it begins. I've been told about these live journals before and never was really interested, but now that I'm 19 I feel like I should spill whatevers on my mind.

Today was interesting, went to Target with Sarah and we didn't get matching outfits and then we went to American Eagle and we didn't buy Cowboy Hats for Countryfest 2004... ok so I'm lying, we def did and the cowboy hats are fucking hot...

Ok kids, its been fun, I'll probably be writing more eventually...

See ya'll in a hot minute:)"

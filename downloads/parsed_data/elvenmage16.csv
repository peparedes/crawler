"event","this is copied directly from my xanga, applies to everyone/thing involved in my life in any way, and is effective immediately:

""everyone seems to be on myspace now, but that's fine. i'm on it too, but i still use xanga as my journal. and in light of recent discoveries, i've made some new decisions.

first of all, i'm going to keep to myself for awhile, so i can get my life back to where i can handle it. a lot of stuff has been going on, and i don't even know what any of it is, except that it sucks. everything has been going screwy since just after v-day, and i'm so confused. but luckily, i know just what to do!

i have very very few true friends, and those very few know who they are beyond a shadow of a doubt. other than those people, i'm going to cut myself off from everything!

so, let's start from scratch. i have my true friends, and no one else. what's next? college of course. hold up, ima get an index card and make a list...ok. so i have my true friends and college. next, i need money, so there is my job at mcdonald's. since i'm still going on needs alone, i'm not even going to consider looking for a new job, because i don't need one, despite how much i may want one.

now sleep. from now on, 8 hours of sleep. every night. unless one of those 3 things override that, because i am going in oder of importance, and anything listed before something else will override anything below it. so true friends, college, mcdonald's, then sleep. then, let's add saxophone/homework/studying/food, all in the same slot. they will all be number five. this short, exclusive, and 100% unabridged list should keep my life together until i can organize it to the point of adding more. until then, i have a message that needs to go out:

To anyone, anything, anywhere, anytime, anyplace that is not on the following list (1-true friends, 2-classes, 3-employment, 4-sleep, 5-sax/homework/studying/food)...if you don't see a place where you fit, GO AWAY!!! leave me alone, and don't bother me with any of your crap. this goes to all the people who want to make my life hell, everything that wants to senselessly waste my time-that is not contribute to one of those five, and to all the garbage that i've faced and will be faced with. GO THE F*CK AWAY! TAKE YOUR SH*T ELSEWHERE, BECAUSE YOU'RE/IT'S NOT WELCOME IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!"""

"event","There are only 5 people interested in the second jazz ensemble, none of which are in the rhythm section.  In the main jazz ensemble, three alto saxophones tried out, and only two made it.  If you can't guess which one didn't on your first try, then you just suck.  Sorry, but ya do.  I have been in some band or another since I first learned sax in 7th grade.  This semester will be my very first since picking up a sax that I am not in a band.  And if you still haven't figured it out that I was the one who didn't make the jazz ensemble, then just go to hell and leave me alone...oh...and have a nice day..."

"event","I am still alive here!  Everything is okay, really...actually, everything is more than okay.  I'm a very happy individual.  It's like there's no reason to be unhappy.  The fact that I'm away from my friends is covered by me being with my family. The fact that I'm away from Becce is covered by the fact that I'll get to see her again. Hopefully on New Year's Eve!  I've never been with anyone besides my family or alone on New Year.  Well, if ya wanna see updates, ya gotta go to my xanga, cause I hardly ever use this. Well, til the next time I do...MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!"

"event","Okay...got outta school after secong block.  I went home and cleaned out my car and vacuumed it.  I also washed it.  It's beautiful again...but it rained.  Oh well, it was beautiful for prom.  But not as beautiful as Nichole.  She did her hair, which she said was painful, and it was still hurting her later that night, but it looked really good.  She wore a black dress and had her corsage (if that's how ya spell it) and flat dressy shoes.  She looked great!  I just had a tux, straight hair, and a skillfully pinned plower (thanks nichole).

K, so I got the clean car, so then I needed to get my hair straightened by my hoe that i couldn't get into the prom.  I went and found Macy's first and got a yellow rose for her, cause the guy there said yellow was for friendship.  She liked it, so that was good.  And I only got burned once.  But it didn't really hurt.  She gave me a walkie-talkie, but it never got used.  I think I was too far way.

So we went to Hungry Howie's after all for the big prom dinner...we saw Brittany's parents there.  I ordered my pizza, and then we walked the more-than-three buildings to Wendy's to get Nichole a frosty, and I got one while we were there too.  Abunch of people were whistling, yelling, and honking on our way there and back.  Probably at Nichole more than me.  And then I ate a little of the pizza and put the rest in my backseat (in the box).  And we went to Wallgreen's to get a camera.

We went to the prom where Nichole for awhile knew a lot more people than I did.  We got pictures, and I think the poses wierded here out a bit.  But I think they'll turn out good...unless I look retarded as always.  We danced a little after shmoozing a little.  Knipple won prom king, and I yelled ""I love Knipple"" before joining the Knipple chant.  Tara beat Rebecca for queen, but Brittany was happy cause at least her rival Janie got 4th runner up.  Then we danced and shmoozed some more.  And that was pretty much the prom.  My last and 2nd to last dance was with Nichole cause we weren't sure if the 2nd to last was the last or not.  And then we left.

We went to the rec center for ""breakfast"", but that was pretty dumb, and she and I were both pretty tired.  So I took her home, and then took me home.  I got most of the way out of my tux, and crashed on my bed.  I slept until about 11 AM, got a shower, cleaned my room some, and that's pretty much everything.  K, hope you're still awake after all that.  Bye!"

"event","Prom was supposed to be simple...just 4 friends gettin' dressed up and goin' to a dance and to eat or whatever.  I'm still not sure exactly what happened, but now everything is messed up.  Micah isn't going to prom at all now.  I'm still going with Nichole, but I want to go with a group too.  I want this to be a fun, anti-stress night.  So I need to find a group.  I also want Mel to go still.  I don't know if she does or not.  Micah won't be there, but she might be grounded then.  If she stays grounded, that'll suck.  Not to mention, I can't even get someone else to get her a ticket until I know if she can go or not because I have to use a senior to do it.  I know EJ isn't going, but he's gonna try to get Melissa a ticket.  I think I'll call her and Nikki up to see what they're doin' that night.  I don't know how Nichole feels about them though.  This is gonna be a long entry...so I'll go now...k, bye!"

"event","I keep up a whole lot better with my Xanga, but whatever.  I updated on there already tonight, so  I figured I'd do one on here.  Ummm...I dunno.  I think I had something to put on here...oh yeah, it was something I forgot to mention on my xanga: Melanie helped me come up with a great idea for sleeping at JSU. Instead of using their hard mattresses, I'm gonna build a nest out of blankets. Nancy said it was a stupid idea, because I'd have to wash all those blankets every week and it'd get really expensive, but that's retarded logic.  I'll be clean when I go to sleep if I shower first, so they'd only need to be cleaned every few months.  And it would be really comfortable.  Also, if some of my friends each donated me a unique blanket, it would be like sleeping with all my closest friends every night at the same time!  Well, you get the idea.  (Get your minds outta the gutter!) Anyway, that was a really great idea that I am gonna try to follow through with. So, if anyone out there wants to donate a blanket, we're gonna plan a time when we can exchange them, so let me know. So far it's just me, Mel, possibly Micah, and whoever else gets invited. LOL! Well, TTYL!"

"event","Wow...I definately have plenty to say now!  I wish I didn't though.   My grandma had a heart attack the day before yesterday.  She was waiting to be accepted for a lung transplant.  She was doing very poorly.  The heart attack weakened her too much, and they said she could no longer recieve the lung.  Yesterday, she passed away at five o'clock.  We were already on our way up to Wisconsin to see her one last time.  Now, I may miss more band than I planned, because instead of going to see my grandma, I'm going to her funeral as a pall-bearer.    It sucks...I may miss more band, and I just found out that the Encores wants to do the old show soon.  I don't know how long I'm here for.  I gave my instrument to Micah to get fixed while I'm gone, and I have my music witrh me to do what I can with it.  It won't be much though, because everyone is very busy.  I thought this would be more productive though, than looking at some music for 5 minutes.  I wanted to let everyone know what was going on.  By the way, this is pretty much just copied from my Xanga site.  Okay, bye!"

Beautiful.

My balances, penalties, and fees were abolished lawfully forever. Your

You have given me a new lease on life.

"event","so my junior year of HIGH SCHOOL is over, and this is where i reflect on what a year i have had, and how i plan to plan my summer.........if you don't read this whole post, @ least scroll down to my allegorical story about my whole year-in-a-story.

i can honestly say that junior year was really one of the best years, schoolwise, that i've had. sjp has been so awesome, i realize that i always complain about how fr. cliffu*k is always CANCELLING my classes, and i'm always getting SCREWED over by the system, but i really think that this is the best place that i want to spend my years in highschool...to think i almost went to bishop eustace *shock* but @ least then i'd have no more than 1 or 2 classes a day.

ummm.....i feel like i've developed my friendly relationships with people moreso than less...i don't even know actually, i say this every year...but it's one of those weird feelings where like RIGHT before the school year ends you feel like you've had a revelation about life or something, and that you are going to use this revelation during the next year and it's gonna be the BEST YEAR EVERRRRRRR, and then it doesn't seem like it was, until it's over...i dunno, wEiRd!

the fantastic three and debbie hilton, those are really the only faculty members i really care to see next year.....and maybe tio jesse, even though he gave me a 67 average in spanish. MUY MAL!

okay, to the point, if someone was to ask me what kind of year i've had, i'd say: ""interesting"", because it truly was an interesting year.

actually, i think my year can be summed up in a surprisingly coincidental anecdote that happened like last week. senor jesse kennon, who swore that we would never ever have a fiesta in his clase de espanol, gave us a party on the last day of school before exams, where he brought in a giant bag full of fortune cookies, and handed out plates and we ate fortune cookies (galetas chinas) (they were fucking good galetas chinas) and he was like ""read your fortunes in spanish"" so we were doing that.

and i got one that went like ""if you know how to read a man, you realize his volumes"" or something like that, basically that you have to look below the surface to see how people really are.

and pat ennis is in my spanish class, and he read his and it was like ""you are very personable and fun to be around"" or something, and i said ""no es verdad"", which means ""not true"" in spanish......and mr. kennon was like ""ahh, senor profaci, remember your fortune cookie, it said to look below the surface"" (all of thsi was in the spanish language) and i pondered that for a bit and i felt like.......emotional or something, in a weird chinese/spanish class kinda way...it was odd, i think i had a revelation or something. it was awakening...

so that was my year, and now i have 3 months to look forward to refining my character and my poise.

PSP PORNO?! i found this on boingboing.net

http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/06/02/news_6126863.html

it's fucking ridiculous (it's safe to open the link, there isn't any porn on it) they are releasing porn to watch conveniently on your Sony PSP............fucked up, what will the children think?

the link to the actual porno site is on boingboing.net.......it's a shame, that girl looks really pretty. i bet she doesn't WANT to be a porn star...she just needs some extra money to go to college...she could just pretend to be a harajuku girl and sell her soul to Gwen Stefani......

"event","trevor and I are on a mission to pick out all the pity-fishers on livejournal and EXPOSE THEM! we've gotten pat ennis out of his pity closet (so to speak) and here is a lovely conversation i just had with dennis monaghan (alexanderrhythm... i think)

thatstoodamnbad: hi
beyondtheveil333: hi
beyondtheveil333: what's up
thatstoodamnbad: I am a bit miffed about the comment you made on Pat's LJ about my father
beyondtheveil333: haha shut the fuck up
beyondtheveil333: i didn't say anything about your father
thatstoodamnbad: "":-( aww and then u can have a pity club""  I find that to be condescending not only towards some of the struggles that others are going through but it also gives a reflection of you and the way that you act.
beyondtheveil333: please dennis, give me a break
thatstoodamnbad: why should I?
beyondtheveil333: cuz you are full of shit
thatstoodamnbad: about what?
beyondtheveil333: about ""derr, your comments are condescending to people with struggles""
beyondtheveil333: cuz i've never struggled in my life dennis, ever
thatstoodamnbad: I am not saying that you have struggles, but others have and the tone used in your statement can and does offend those who are going through tough times like Pat and myself and countless others at school
beyondtheveil333: jesus you are fucking stupid, A) i was being sarcastic, of course i have had struggles, B) i was pointing out that those of you that post ur shit on livejournal like ""oh no, i got a bad grade on a test today, i think i'm going to slit my wrists, shower pity on me, please please"" are really dumb
thatstoodamnbad: for some persons using LiveJournal is the only way that can make a cry for help
beyondtheveil333: well boo hoo real people talk to other people instead of sitting on their computers typing suicide poetry 
beyondtheveil333: and with that i bid you adieu
thatstoodamnbad signed off at 9:12:42 PM. 

3 things i found interesting in this conversation. 

-dennis's FIRST mistake, in his opening statement, he used the word ""miffed"" which normal people don't use, especially people trying to make a point.

-he opened saying ""I am a bit miffed about the comment you made on Pat's LJ about my father"" when in reality, i said NOTHING about his father, and he copy/pasted my comment to him in it's entirety 2 IMs later, "":-( aww and then u can have a pity club""

-he implied that i didn't have any struggles, which in essence was him saying ""i have to go through hardships and you don't because i have STRUGGLES!!!""



ohhhhhhhh dennis, you are soooooooooooooooooooooo unfortunate. i am so lucky that i don't have any STRUGGLES! i just don't know what i'd do if i had struggles!!"

anyway that song rocks my world...

so today was blah, i actually can't even remember what i did... we ate at casanova grill, the italian restaurant near my house, and the man who owns it is friends with my dad. he's nice. so i kinda just got up and walked outside and sat in the car when i finished eating, and i guess my mom must've brought up like not eating meat on fridays to him or something, cuz he came outside of the restaurant to the car and he was like ""eating meat on friday wasn't started by poor fishing villages"" and i was like ""yeah it was, mr. deitch taught me that, cuz they had shitty economy or w/e so they had to eat fish."" 

i actually forget what happened, but he was like all up in my grill, and i totally defended my point, and he was like ""umm...oh"" afterwards, and i wanted to jump at him and be like ""MWAHAHHA BOOH YEAH SONUVABITCH!""

but i didn't.

anyway i was on www.showstudio.com earlier and i found this picture, and it's a shame because this is probably all these people have to wear or w/e in africa, but lemme be the first to say that africans have wicked style, it's true. 
<img src=""http://www.showstudio.com/projects/hyena/img/1_lg.jpg"">

that pic better have showed up. 
although i couldn't see that style picking up across the pond, but i think that maybe if i DIDN'T live in NJ, and i was going to a party or something, and i was drunk, then i'd definitely wear whatever that afrikan guy is wearing. 

btw if i was a little bit more PETA i'd totally be offended by that pic cuz that hyena is being abused, very very sad.

utada just came on my iPod.
<img src=""http://www4.islanddefjam.com/media/utada/utada5.jpg"">
she effing rocks, i wish she wasn't so unknown in the USA (she's like fucking britney spears, in Japan) cuz i'd definitely go see her if she went on tour.

okay, so get this:
i went to go see constantine the other day (worst movie ever ever ever, like literally i rarely say that i don't like movies. this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen) but anyway, there was this commercial before the movie came on, it was a commercial for adidas. and i liked it so much cuz i thought it sounded a little bit yeah yeah yeahs-esque (and i'm all about karen o) so i wrote myself a text message with some of the lyrics so i could come home and find the song and illegally download it. (and then tell a friend about it so they buy the album and i don't have to feel bad about having illegally downloaded it, because i promoted it)

so i got home, and i searched for the lyrics, and it turns out that other people felt the same sentiments about this commercial, and tried to find out what song it was (cuz it was no where on the internet) and someone wrote an e-mail to Adidas, to see who sang the song.............................



AND IT WAS THE YEAH YEAH YEAHS!!!!!!!!! it's like a new track or something, i don't think it'll be on their new album, it's very introvert. but maybe. BUT THAT SONG FRUCKING ROCKED!!!!!! it was so good! i can't even remember what it sounded like, but i know that i was so impressed by it when i heard it that whenever i hear it i'll love it.

yeah the yeah yeah yeahs rock my socks. fo shizzle.

anyway so that was my day. if i don't go to best buy tomorrow, i'll die. :-("

"event","boo i need to go back to school so i have things to update about...

on tuesday before i went to kairos we started making gargoyles in sculpture class, and we had to make sketches of them first so we would know what to do with the wire. so i did a few sketches but basically knew what i was gonna do, and ms. hilton gave me the clear to start working with the wire (later to be covered with paper mache)

so everyone else drew like stick figures and ms. hilton was like ""no, i need everyone to do @ least four sketches before they start"" and i had only done three but she knew that i knew what i was doing. the people were like ""how come you let sal start, if he only had 3 sketches"" and everyone made this huge deal about it and they were all like, being real jerks. so this kid nick rizzo took plyers and threw them at my base for the gargoyle, which may not sound important but i had to spend another half hour of work fixing it. so i got up and went to a different part of the art room where the old sculptures are waiting to be graded, and i saw my wire indian sculpture and one of it's legs was bent back, and it had to have been done with someone, and i feel like it was this other kid matt daley who is a trashy kid from philadelphia that only took the class cuz he thought it would be easy, but it wasn't, so now he just complains and forces ms. hilton to do the projects for him.

so anyway the leg was bent back and i got it and showed it to ms. hilton and she was helping this other kid colin, and he was like ""it's not a big deal, just bend it back"" that was his retarded response.

when you bend the wires it stretches them out and uncoils them from the rest of the sculpture. if i bend it back there will be extra wire sticking out like all over the horse part of my sculpture. and the worst part was that ms. hilton didn't even say anything, or stick up for me at all.

this situation is worse, but comparable to the beginning of the year when this kid in my class kevin stolarski took a few of my art sketches and erased my name and put them in his book, and he also stole lots of ms. hilton's ""mate"" (a south american coffee drink) and i was the only other person in the room and i was supposed to be keeping a look out for her stuff, cuz she wasnt there. so she got back on monday and was like ""sal did you drink some of my mate"" and i was like ""no, kevin did"" (what else was i suppsoed to do, it didn't just disappear) so she tells kevin that i told on him, and then he told everyone else to call me a ""narc"" and she just laughed about it.

i love art and sculpture so much, and i try REALLY hard in that class, but i don't know if i can keep on doing it if no one is going to give me the respect that i should get as a classmate and a student. it's just bullshit. and i'm having doubts about taking advanced placement studio art next year...but i dunno. i need an AP...

it's just really retarded that people have to be jealous, ridiculous.

 

anyway, then i went on kairos and nick the kid that threw the plyers was on my kairos, and i was like...kind or w/e 2 him cuz it was a spiritual retreat. but that's kind of wearing off now and i really can't stand these retarded kids in my class, except for colin and mark cice and this other kid rob. but w/e, i dunno...

anyway people comment or i'll die."

Hmm... so i had to unwind the wire boobies, but @ least now i'm going to have a wire sculpture that isn't completely inappropriate and that makes my pervertedness obvious <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley1.gif"" width=15> <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley3.gif"" width=15></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>but I also made a crucifix out of wire, and it's SUPER SUPER SUPER SUPER SUPER SUPER cool. i &lt;3 it, just like i &lt;3 jesus.</P>
<P>anyway...</P>
<P>So the O.C. tonight?!?!?!? AHHHHH!!!!!!!!! it was SO good. and i think that alex's girlfriend was the girl from the movie snow day, i'm gonna check on IMDB right now. hmm... i can't find her...but i guess she isn't. if anyone knows what i'm talking about just smile and nod.</P>
<P>it was good though. my relief sculpture is so good, it's on the second floor so if u are going to the SJP mixer tomorrow, go to the second floor, then look @ it, then tell me how much you &lt;3 it!!!!!</P>
<P>i'm done, leave me comments!!!!!</P>
<P>the only poll question i have for my NEW and UNPERVERTED wire sculpture is horse or no horse...<IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley1.gif"" width=15></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>EDIT::: <IMG height=543 src=""http://www.kinoweb.de/film2001/SnowDay/pix/sd05_L.jpg"" width=363></P>
<P>that's the girl i'm thinking of, but it's obviously not alex's lesbian lover from the O.C........ sure looks darn close. oh well.</P>"

"event","i'm gonna ask random questions, and you have to think of what i'm thinking of in my head and post an answer in comments, or you aren't my friend anymore, cuz this is important.    i'll explain what all this is for when i'm finished it. 

okay, in all seriousness.

A. Pick a number, 3, 4, or 5.

B. laces or no laces (keep in mind laces will take longer for what i'm doing, and if they turn out good it will turn out REALLY good, but if it doesn't then it'll turn out not so good. )

C. cat, slave, or blindfold?

D. long up-to-arm gloves, or short just-hand gloves?

E. red or black?

F. tall boots, or short boots?

final question: cover or half cover

 

you have time to answer this, cuz i'm not gonna update for a while, but everyone answer so i know what to do, because i'm being completely random."

"event","<P>so there's like a crime spree in my neighbourhood, and my parents just got back from a town meeting @ the police station. it's so weird, i hope i don't get my throat slit by someone that wants to steal my cell phone. <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley2.gif"" width=15> it's so shady...</P>
<P>anyway, on a happier note. my dog needs new ears, make his eyes see forever, make him built like me, again, and again.</P>

<P>fascist baby, utopia, utopia, utopia...</P>
<P>i'm so tired, i have to finish the effing spanish homework. on a brighter note, mr. deitch is like my #1 bud again. i was overreacting, as usual. and i creeped out like everyone in mr. gillespie's office today, which included me and mr. gillespie, and eventually brad kelly. cuz he gave me this book to read so i would be occupied while he made calls or something, and it was a book about psychotherapy or w/e, but they were talking about masturbation and sex drive, and ""oedipus"" something or other, where ur a girl and you develop a complex that you think your parents favour humans with penises, so you at first cling to your mother because you think she has a penis, and you want to have sex with her. but then you realize she doesn't, then you don't love your mother anymore and you want to have babies with your father, but not have sex...it's complicated. i plan to be an oedipus specialist when i grow older. <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley1.gif"" width=15> &lt;=======3</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>anyway, that was too random. i'm done ranting now. you better comment if you read this, or else i will perish. *perishes*</P>"

<P>harry potter looks SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL in this picture. GoF is gonna rock my socks so much. it's just so awesome.</P>
<P><IMG height=504 src=""http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/images/2005/01/radcliffegof-medium.jpg"" width=758></P>
<P>however, in this picture he needs a haircut really badly. harry, what are you doing? get a haircut. but not that much, just enough so that it's not annoying to me. this picture of dan radcliffe reminds me of this kid @ my school that REALLY annoys me. but i think he has a mental problem, it's sad, he like looks in lots of directions @ once. he was like spazzing today when he saw this alumni guy. it was kinda funny. but harry in this picture also reminds me of a kid i don't mind so much. so maybe i'm jus being judgemental. like the question on mr. oldham's exam. which i failed. i'm not going to school tomorrow. i rule, yeah.</P>"

"event","good news: these exams seem so easy that i only have to study for one or 2, maybe, so the fact that i just can't get into a studyin' mood is okay since even if i don't study i'll still get a good grade.
bad news: i have 2 really awesome relief-esque sculptures that i want to do for the art show, but i can't decide which one i like better, and they are both really good..., so

VOTE OR DIE!!!
|A|
|B| 

it's A or B, pick one, vote or die!!
that reminds me of the south park episode with p. diddy, when he goes to south park cuz stan won't vote for a giant douchebag or a terd, and there's a music video and p. diddy's like ""shake that thang when u vote bitch"" and it's this stereotypical rap video, except with voting. it's funny.

anyway, so today i'm studying for exams, i guess. . . . .people comment on this post!! and vote or die, bitch."

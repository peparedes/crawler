i went to work and hated it cus elfreda threw up and it was my table.
amanda talked to me. she is one of my favorite people EVER.

went home and took a real fast power nap then went to meet the girls.
went to the movies then ashely forgot her id so she couldnt get in.
so went to applebees and ate 
then went to the dive ins since they dont id there 
and it was closed so it was useless
but we did get a cone and a couple of comfy chairs.
then went to king tuts and chilled with some people.
then went back to our cars as we had a 10min dance break out.
it was great.
then drove home and parked my car and sat alone as i lisened to bloody sunday.
it was a perfect ending.
 
there are words that can be strung together and repeated in my ear in a particular order that will unlock the codes of my heart. i sit and wait on them."

its gay its not needed.
i love when people make me laugh.
today the best thing was said to me
and i believed every bit of it 
just because when they said it to me
they looked in my eyes and made me see what they saw.
then to top it off i got one of the best texts ever
and it wasent from someone i would like it to be.
but that person doesnt do much anymore.
i think they kinda died and found happiness somewhere else.
i cant wait to feel the way i did before. i loved that feeling. i was so sure about everything. now its all second guessing. i still think way to much more then you deserve.
well i want to keep this one good and not go into something that drives me crazy.
the only true freinds you can have is a pen and a pencil.
base your life around something that will never change or give up on you. trust me it will be the best thing in the end."

because you always say stuff and make it seem

i also sometimes think that maybe you are my friend
just so you can put me down and make yourself 
feel superior or just a little better about yourself
i dont get why you choose me though
i have now realized that a real friend doesnt ever 
put another ""friend"" down that this is not normal
and its not right 
i hate how one person can make you feel so low about yourself
and really make you think about if you are good enough
for anything 
its funny cause all that they need to say are 3 little words 
to make it all go down hill 
i really dont know why you cant just be happy for me 
or maybe say one nice thing about me 
and it wouldnt matter if you believed it or not
just the thought would be more then enough

"event","so this weekend really kicked ass
so much happened and it was all so very great
first friday i came home and then and went to zia
cause simplfy was playing and it was so outstanding
then we talked to rob and told him we had to go 
so we left to the marquee theater 
and got there just in time to see authority zero
oh man and they put on a amazing show 
i could cry cause or how great it was
just everything was so wonderful about it 
the crowd, the friends, and especially the band
so then pepper came on and it was the worst 
i will forever long dislike pepper 
it was a great night and wont ever forget it 


Then saturday came and i went to a unity walk with my two sisters
it was very cool lots of people were there
and i saw some pretty awesome talents that blew me away
came home after that and slept hahaha
i woke up and got ready to go to another show
we went to the marquee theater again
and we got the last parking spot in the place 
we went inside and waited for straylight run to come 
and sang our little hearts out 
it was so beautiful
i saw brad and didnt really think it was him so i told kally 
and come to find out it was him
so we waved to him and his girlfriend
it was about 8:54 and simplfy was going to come on at 9:10 
so i asked if we could stay for just one more song
and when i asked that they announced that it was there last song
so we were able to see all of straylight run
it was a great show
so then right when they hit the last note 
we walked very fast out of that place
and right when we got out of the marquee we ran all the way to the car 
which was kinda far 
so we shoved each other in the car
and sped almost the whole way 
and those damn stop lights took forever
so i had to go push the button thing so we should go
then we finally got to the sets and it was 9:15 
and we were so happy that we made it and then we just froze
when we saw the freakin line it was so long
we almost cryed
we were hoping that they would be behind schedule but no for one day they 
were right on time
we stood in line for about 10,15 minutes 
it was horrible hearing simplfy from outside and not being able to be inside with them
FINALLY we got in and ran to the front not caring whos way we would be blocking
and was able to see them for about 3 songs or so 
it was one of simplfys best show 
everyone had so much energy 
then when they finished their set we were kicked out 
so we hung out outside and talked to a few of the fellows in the band
then we went to eat at ihop 
and saw triston and jason and scott 
funny guys 
then went to kallys and told scary stories and played with candles 

the best part about this weekend was the people that i was with
i have the best friends in the world 
and i wouldnt give them up for the world

"event","i went to the authority zero show 
and saw scaring kids scaring kids who are really great 
but az kicked their ass
its weird how you know who your real friends are at shows 
like how they look after you and how they really do care
and how they move from a great front row view to behind and really tall person
just to stand by you 
well yeah if you havent experienced this then im sorry 
and you need to find better concert buddys
and if this doesnt happen anymore just be glad that you did have it 


its also weird how people can change so much
and you try so hard to make things the same 
but you just cant 
so then you change and its just way different from what it was
and all you have are all of those great memories that you can still laugh to
and still have a good cry at night because you miss it so much
and you might feel replaced but you try to keep that far from your mind 
cause you know or hope they wouldnt do that 
but then it gets so silent that you just know its going to happen
and that makes you sad
but really there is only so much you can do and keep tying and trying
then you will get to a point where you almost want it to stop and give up 
and then you fell lost and not like yourself


well this is all just stuff i think way to much about 
i will get better 
this will get better"

there were some clapping songs which is always nice
stood by the fire to get warm and it really worked
until you left then you would get cold really fast 
kinda weird
we went to applebees after 
the waiter was very weird
me and jessica 
inhaled some cheesy sticks and fries
took home a nice napkin for memorys
i met a few people that were so nice and funny 
i had a pretty great night"

"event","WELL 
today was the beautiful day that the used played 
we rode out there and ate some cinnamON rolls made by the one and only kally
we finally got there and found a spot to park
we didnt have to wait in a line and we got in right away
we get a shirt
we listen to head automatic (very great band)
we go buy the cd 
and well just about the best thing that happened that night
JASON SHOWS UP THE guy im going to marry
we all start to freak out like girls that we are
we couldnt stop looking 
he leaves backstage and we go to the crowd
FINALLY the used comes on and wow 
i love those guys they always put on a fanstasic show
we all try to yell out to jason hoping he would hear us but our voices get weaker and weaker
so he doesnt see us
but its ok cause i still love him and NOTHING can change that
so we listen to the used and i sing my heart out cause well its the used
it was so much fun
only thing i wish i got into a pitt at least one
so the show ends and we are so concentrated on jason but he leaves and we dont see him anymore
we get into the car and get a few drinks and food and go home
i had a great night 
i wish we talked to jason"

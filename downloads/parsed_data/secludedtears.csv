I think we are both getting baptized. Wonderful. There's going to be between twenty and fifty people there o___o; That's a lot. But hey if people love my daughter so much, why not? </p><p>On the other hand. My back is constantly killing me. I can't seem to get the pain to go away. I can take Soma. One.. nothing. two... feeling it. But then the pain comes back real quick. It's so fucking annoying. I feel like I'm going to split in two. So therefore I am going to get insurance, and possibly not work. Then I'm going to get a lawyer and file for disabilty. I don't really know if I will be able to get it or not. But you know it's worth a shot if nothing else I will get my back fixed. </p><p>Friday I am going to get tubes in baby's ears. Then I'm going to get my permit.. AGAIN. Then I get to go clean the fucking house.I unno. I'm&nbsp;calling&nbsp;Rose State&nbsp;Denistry school to see if they'll clean my teeth and shit so. Yeah anyway, what's up with the&nbsp;world, lemme know.</p>"

"event","Well&nbsp; hello again. I was googling up rikku sadaichi and came across this journal. Holy fucking lord it's been with me forever, needs to be updated. Of course, like most people I have transfered to myspace, but this one can be kept up with too, why not?&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; I have a daughter too. Her name is Eternity Dawn. My son is two Nathaniel Wayne. I no longer have custody of Nathan, my&nbsp; mom took him and wont give him back. I have a $183.00 child support payment now. I don't&nbsp;mind really.&nbsp; She took him because my sorry ex ""fiance"" their father started beating me then&nbsp; decided they needed the same treatment. Needless to say, I left him. Finally. Three months ago.&nbsp;Don't know what the hell I was thinking, I really don't. That bastard fucked me up in so many ways.&nbsp;

Right now I'm looking for a job, considering he&nbsp;screwed me on my highschool diploma. I need money so I can get a GED and be on with my life. God, look where I was. Oppurtunites everywhere... and I was in a hurry to grow up. Why?&nbsp; Why was I so stupid? Then I got taken advantage of. And my life is pretty well set now. I'm getting a job, raising my kid, and getting married. Average American life. My boyfriend's name is Jon. He has two kids as well. He's a self employed mechanic, wonderful man.&nbsp;

I live with Stacey and Wayne. They are my parents age and decided to take me in after knowing my daughter and finding out what Colt put me through. They decided I needed help, so they are my guardian angels. I owe them my life. I just recently called my Dad and am attempting to create a relationship with him again. Hadn;t talked to my brothers in five years, I called on Matt's birthday and we talked. That was weird.&nbsp;

I still enjoy drawing and am currently trying to find a Tatoo parlor to apprentice at or a place to start doing prep work for cars or bikes to get painted. I tried going back to school then I got slammed with child support so I need to get back to work. Hm. I think that is it for now, if I Think of somthing else I'll let you know."

Plus, she'll be attending my school as a freshmen. I hate freshmen. When you become a high class-men, you realize how stupid you really were. Lol. I don't mind her moving in at all, because she takes up my moms' time and I don't have to be around all the fucking time. e_e'; Lemme say, that got old. 

When I woke up today. It was cold and windy outside. Cold front moved in, feels pretty good, if you have appropriate cloths for the weather. My legs are hurting like hell though, fun fun. Plus, I ride the bus for an hour and twenty minutes to get a whole mile down the street from my house, if that. 

Plan for today... =/. Am I supposed to have one? 

I have to say thank you to all of you, for being friends, really. I've had completely different responses from other people I've told. That was depressing. Those people I don't really speak with anymore. I gave up trying to keep contact with people who don't give a damn whether I was alive. If I had a computer I guess I would not have had such a problem keeping in touch with you. My apologies, at some point I do intend to get one. By the time I graduate here, I can get at least a part time job making seventeen dollars an hour, I believe I can fit a computer in that budget. Hm, thanks again for the support. 
Much love from a friend, until next time-"

Uncomfortable why? Since many of you have not been told shockingly,yet I appreciate those whom I asked to keep my secret. I am having my first child. He is said to be born next Monday. Yes, I am sixteen. Yes, I plan on getting married to the Father. I can say this has not worked out easily. We are frowned upon. He's twenty-two, I'm sixteen. No, it's not illegal as many believe it to be. I know this,due to the fact, my father tried to have him arrested, it did not work. Colt, my boyfriend, and I have been together not quite a year. Yes, I sound like a whore. Am I? No, not by definition. I've kissed a total of two guys. Only slept with one. No, not a whore. I slept with him four times by the time I got pregnate. Sad sad little girl believing it would not happen to me. Never believe that. It is quite false. I am still living with my mother, because she believes she can have me as a run away if I move out. Also I cannot bare to break my mothers heart. I have not figured out why just yet.

"event","Hello memories of a simple life. Ah the good ol' days, when I could whine and pout. Times change. Hope we all know this by now. Being pushed into the real adulthood. Whoo. Thought I was an adult before. Ha. I wasn't ready. Now not given a choice, actually I was, but I chose this life for myself and it's about to get alot more complicated. Fighting against my mother for the life I've chosen, made the same mistakes she did. Hm, funny I can understand my mothers postition much better now. Next week I'll become an adult, wether I'm ready or not, or wether I like it or not. There's no going back now. . ."

My grades are suffering terribly from mostly the teachers I don't like u.U'; I guess I was absent too much. Get bored with school and don't go...not a good idea, okay...? And Dude I saw this girl come into the class to transfer, but she had the littlest baby i'd ever seen. It was so small. My big ass brothers were nine and ten pounds. But it was cute. ^_^' But ugh yeah grades, suffering because i get side tracked As seen above.

"event","I'm really bored. Computer class is too easy and I type to fast so I get done with work fast. e_e'; Bordem. It hurts. Oh for those of you who didn;t like the fact my boyfriend lived with me: He got kicked out, a long time ago, but still. Now i get to see him maybe once every three weeks. For like five minutes. Yay, isn't life fun?

I've been writing Aaron, only one who TI'm keeping in touch with since I've left the computer. He's pretty cool still, he apologized for being an ass when we broke up. True he was though. Things happen, can't hang on to the bad things in the past, that keeps you afraid and un confident. For instance,my whole problem now is being scared of being ""self-centered"" Well of coarse you're going to sound self-centered in a journal. It's your journal. Who do you write about in a journal, you and what happens in your life. Coarse, I am different in real life, but, few of you really know that. Guess what? I don't care if you do think I'm self centered anymore. Don't like me? Fuck you, don't talk to me.Manuel..

Sorry I'm in a ranting mood. Thinking about bullshit that's happened lately. With people who I thought were my friends, like Manuel,and then decide because I've changed, and for the better, he's gonna say he doesn't like me. A few things have happened lately that I need to grow up for. I'm not going to stay the same. I suppose one would notice wether or no I have changed if they talked to me. It doesn't appear that I have through this, but oh well. I'm going to leave now. 
Have fun all."

"event","Have you ever lost somthing dear to you? But at the same time gained somthing good? Has somthing fallen slowly out of your grasp and you can't do anything about it? Has anyone else felt like their whole world fell apart? It's an odd feeling to know that things were taken from you because of one decision. Perhaps what was lost really wasn't lost but merely appeared that way. Maybe it was just your imagination. If it was lost,maybe it will return. There are an endless amount of answers to any question,any choice. Several things in this world that still remain unanswered. After all there is no real answer to anything. It's what people assume is correct,""normal"". Just because someone looks like a regular person,doesn't mean they are.From what I've observed, it's the normal people the have had the worst experiances. Then again, I don't know..

Alot of things I say have no meaning,unimportant. Infact, I really don't know if anything that's come out of my mind has been important. I am quite sure none of it was vitial,or necissary. I was told once that if you talked to me for need,you'd already be gone. I'm only for fun right? After all you can't hold a serious conversation with me, can you? 

Hm. Now that I got that out I feel better. I'm not sure of much  anymore. I'm sorry for such a long rant."

Special note:
Those who not long desire my friendship tell me, that's all I ask. Yes I do notice those that are trying to get rid of me,I'm not stupid. 

I have four more days left at my dads. Then it's no computer and no phone.I suppose sometime I will send my sister onto AIM to reach the few people that do call me. Damn the distance. e_e'; 

Anyway. Any questions then IM. Bye."

I was supposed to be back on an hour and a half before I was. Then Jeph left. He ignored me in the first place for a more ""serious"" conversation with Andrea. Sou, heh. I don't know if he called me. May have. But when I come online he tells me goodnight. I'm just like, fine whatever.It appears that since I've been gone people have taken a disliking to me.Like the ones that said they missed me, are the ones who look more like their avoiding me.Perhaps I'm paranoid. But I mean, I understand why Manuel left today. I asked him to. But Jeph just flat out ignoring the ""girl he wants to date so much"" for his ex girlfriend.. well.. that seems to put a <i> great</i>  impression for dating, right? =D.::sighs: Everything exept being Sara's friend again, has been a terrible mess. I really wish I would just give up, don't you?"

Signed on Gaia yesterday, alot of things have changed, many new places opened up. 

Don't plan on doing much today or tomarrow, try to persuade my parents to let my sister and myself go to the movies tomarrow. Maybe..maybe. 

Not sure if the password on my computer is the same, I'm on Stacie's screen. Doesn't matter I can access everything all the same, just have to go the longer way. 

Wish there were more people to talk to. Talked to Becca this morning. Was enjoyable.Told Sou to go to bed then study ...::sigh:: . Sara and I are talking more. She's grown up a bit. Haven't talked to anyone since Sara.

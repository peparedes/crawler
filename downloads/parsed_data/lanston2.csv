"event","yes, i will make this entry about complaining ... even though i really can't, but it still annoys me.

so i go to FIU to give my tuition waiver in. they take it, but then tell me that i need to pay $75 in fees, including parking and ID. fair enough about the parking, but the ID? Hello! I've had the same Id for the past 3 years. so i pay anywayze, it's still better than the 900 bucks i would've had to pay for just one grad class. so then i go to get my parking decal, and they bust out with i have to pay an extra $20 because i need to buy a hangtag, so i'm like WTF??!!! i just paid $75 in parking fees at cashier's and now you tell me i need to pay more? how can FIU suck so much! i hate coming back here for grad school, which takes me back to my original sentence. I SHOULD NOT BE COMPLAINING.

i mean, paying less that $100 is a fairly good deal for not having to pay tuition. but it still annoys me at how disorganized FIU is that they couldn't tell me from the beginning that i needed to pay all this crap, and just throw it at me the day everything has to be paid. i mean, what if i didn't have the money to pay, and i was stuck and they would've dropped my classes? fuck them, fuck them right in the ear.

that is all

as for leaving my current job, i would be lying if i said i'm not sad. there's a lot of people here i'll miss, but a lot more that i'm really glad i'll never see again, so overall i'm really happy to be leaving.

went shopping, bought some amazing clothes for the new job. i also can't wait for the end of july, i get the results for my FSE. if i did good, which i think i did, i could get a job as a foreign service officer, and i could work anywhere in the world! can you imagine ... me as the next ambassador to the U.N. hi amazing! hehe

slept 3 hors last night and then spent the whole day dong that tupid naturalization ceremony. hopefully this will be the last one i ever do. if only. this lady got pissed at me when i told her that kosovo is not a country, and apparently she was really proud of being from there, so she gave me this really pissed off look and then walked away. but she finally understood why her certificate didn't say kosovo. it was just funny. i knew i was right.

finals next week, finally finishing school. taking the first week of may off for vacation. gonna sleep, have sex all the time, and maybe hit up orlando. haven't decided yet. darin, will, kim, danny, yoanliz are all coming to my graduation ceremony. super excited. can't wait to all of us hang out. it'll be kool for my friends to meet the boyfriend.

otherwise things are great, danny is great, we just had our 2 month the other day. he pretty much lives at my house, but i don't complaint cuz i really like having him with me. sux i can't see him more often thatn i would like, but hey, i'm happy. i haven't fought with my family in a while so that's good news, and i'm thinking of getting a hybrid car. always wanted one and now i think will be the best time.

time to pretend to study now.

"event","i got a 94 on my wine quiz. i was totally surprised since i studied for it for like 5 minutes.

anywayze, still waiting on the job, they called my references and asked me for a bunch of paperwork, but i still need a letter from HR officially extending me a job offer. i really hope i get it. i can't wait until i quit the current hellhole i currently work at.

"event","so i woke up this morning with this frustrated outlook on life. i dunno what it is. the same old jitters ... what's gonna happen with my life after graduation. so yeah, that's what's probably on my mind the most right now. the people at my job keep being little assholes and giving me the run-around on this whole future job issue to fuck them, so i applied for other jobs of course. my sis is looking to see what she can find me at the place she works at. she works at this back not far from where i work, and it would be kool, the pay wuold be awesome, and i would get to see her more often, which is something i don't do. but yeah, the downside would be that it has nothing to do with what i studied, and i really wanna get a move on with my career. but otherwise i keep getting turned down from these other jobs cuz they say i have no experience ... how am i supposed to get any experience if no one will give me a chance! damm fiu! you suck for not giving me enough field research experience, but get this, starting this fall, all students will be required to take a 2 credit field research course. where was that when i was there! *shakes fist*

anywayze, so as i was saying, i've been applying at other places. one of them was with broward county, in the department of health, as an environmental specialist. and guess what! they called me for an interview. it's an entry leel position so i'm hoping they'll give me that chance, but my interview is on friday so i'm super nervous. as the day gets closer and closer i get more and more nervous. hey, if it all works out i can have a job soon, a job that i actually will like. but moving on, i don't wanna jinx myself. 

so i got into another fight with my sister (the one i live with), so nothing new there. she told me the usual: ""i took care of you, so you owe me your life (cap crap and more crap)"", so i told her ""sorry our parents died, sorry i ruined your life, but i'm not gonna grovel at your feet for the rest of my life."" so now i'm looking to move out of her house soon. daisy said i can move in with her hopefully by mid/end april, so that would be kool. living on my own though, would be weird. and that brings me to something else ... this enw apartment would be in north miami, close to the FIU north campus. that's really far from where i live now, and it's bothering danny cuz he says i won't see hi as often we live far from each other. i keep telling him that won't be the case since he's getting his car soon (hopefully), and i would go see him all the time, aside from the fact that he always stay over my house anwayze. but it still seems to be bothering him, so i told him to let it be and we'll deal with it when the time comes, i mean i'm not even sure it's gonna happen for sure yet. but yeah, things are good with him. he was sick all last week so we didn't do much so that sucked, but we're going to lincoln on friday so that should be kool. looking forward to some good times.

that's all for now

You know how important it is to do things<br>efficiently and on time.

"event","BAD PENIS 

I go into the bathroom to take a piss, and then when I am done, I shake my penis. But when I throw it back into the covers of my briefs......it leaks a little more piss....then my khakis are fucked for the next 10 minutes, and i have to find a way to cover it....such as washing my hands and sprinkling my whole outfit, so it looks like i just splashed...I can sit there and shake it for an hour but it doesnt matter, the piss still thinks its funny to hide for a moment. 
OR i just shake it so hard, someone walks in, looks and walks back out, embarrassed as I let out a ""No...i was.....!"" 

Well..In my younger days, I tried wrapping it in toilet paper in case when i put it back it leaked....but that didnt turn out well, you see because of wrapping it, i named it ""Mummy"", and when my dad walked in during an intimate moment with my self, i was screaming ""OH! Mummy! OH Mummy!"" and well he mistook that for something else. 

So as you can see, My penis..gets me in trouble all the time!"

"event","as some of you already know, i haven't been myself for the last couple of weeks. i dunno what it is, there's just something in the air that keeps me in this mood. i'm sure everyone's felt it, the one where you hate the universe, everything irritates you, you don't want to do anything but lay in bed and watch tv, you eat everything in sight, and you avoid people, even those you get along with the most because they just simply annoy you, but yet you still surround yourself with 2 or 3 who you can still tolerate. random, i know, but i just don't know what it is. i haven't been able to carry a conversation with no more than 4 people in the past few weeks, including kevin, darin, bobby joe, and yoanliz. ricahrd sometimes too but we don't talk often anywayze. even though i have been talking to danny (bobby's BF) and he's a kool kid, so maybe he'll break in that inner circle. w/e. so yeah, it's been like that.

i know for a fact that graduation is looming heavily on my mind, and i can't decide if to be excited or not. on one hand i am happy that school is finally over, but on the other hand (which seems to override the other one) school is finishing, and now what? what do i do with my life? do i wanna go to rgaduate school? do i wanna work? am i leaving miami? what?? i just don't know. i simply don't know what i want to do with my life and that really irritates me because i always knew what to do next, what my next step would be, but now it's all a blur. at carol's advice i applied for a job as a Foreign Service Officer with the State Department, i'm scheduled to take the entrance exam in april, so we'll see how that goes. it sounds like an exciting job and would be awesome to work abroad and with many divrese groups of people while learning about new cultures worldwide. hopefully that works out. another job is as an Environmental Protection Specialist with the EPA in DC. that would be kool too since i love DC (even though i've never been there). and i can go pelt the president with small rocks whenever i feel like it :P. enough of that.

yesterday was my dad's bday. he would've been 53 this year. i was super depressed and cried, but part of me knows that he's always there and he's not really gone, but i still wish i had some memories of being with him. it's just not easy.

i'm going to coli with bobby and danny to celebrate danny's bday, hopefully that'll cheer me up a bit, and i'm still planning on something for vday for kev, i just don't know what to do. any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

You are a gentle soul, with good intentions toward everyone.
Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

p.s. in case you didn't know, i'm walking in the graduation ceremony next monday.

"event","it's really been a long time since i updated this thing. i always say ... ""i'll try to update more often so i don't have huge long entries"" but guess what! i never have time or i just don't care lol. besides, i don't know anyone that reads this but here it goes ...

a lot of things have happened since i last updated. the first is the news that i went alumn from DLP. i quit my brotherhood director chair after an unfortunate incident and then i decided to be an alummi member. it's best this way, i'd been thinking about leaving for a while and it was just time. it was time for me to move on, let someone else stress over the group. it also took a lot of my time and energy, and iw as tired of not having any time for me alone. now, with all the free time, i've been able to get back on some things i enjoyed, such as going to the gym on a regular basis, work on the starship models (i'm almost done with the defiant), catch up on some sleep, and spend time with people that i lost touch with when i started stressing over the group, so now someone else cant ake care of it. i still lve everyone, i still see them and we talk, laugh, do everything, eat shit, but i'm just not in charge of everything anymore, and i can breathe. 

on other news, i bought a new car. it's a 2004 mazda 3. my old car was a bit that ... old. it just had so much wrong with it and it was time for a change. i was spending more money on it than was worth, and it just makes sense for me to pay for a new car rather than spend more and more money on a clunker. i can't find a picture of it online so u just have to use ur imagination hehe. the bad thing is that i have to work a lot more in order to pay for it, but it's ok, i'm happy, and i've been doing good so far. besides, next semester i'll have plenty of time to work since i only have 2 classes left to take.

speaking of school, i'm finally walking in the graduation ceremony next month. i'm super excited. i only have 3010 to take next semester, plus i'm taking a special topics class with Dr. Parker, and i'm helping one of the grad students with her research , so that's more than enough credits to graduate. speaking of parker's class, i went to ask him how that class would be and he told me it was gonna be super easy, kinda like an intro to env. science course for liberal studies majors, so super dumbed down. he said it was gonna be easy for me and he'd better not see me in his class next semester, but fuck that, if it's gonna be easy y am i gonna take a hard class. he wants me to take env. education, but to be honest, education doesn't interest me. and there's like no other kool electives being offered. i wanted to take wine tasting but i decided against it. it sounds too cliche. i could've also taken gay and lesbian studies in the US, but i heard the class stops in the 1980's .. shit happends after the 1980's! a scary thought is what would happen after graduation? i mean what would i do? i've always wanted to join the peace corps, but i just bought a new car and u need to have like no debt b4 u get shipped out. there's always graduate school, but i wanna take a break b4 i rush into more schooling. my best bet seems to be applying for a job with the EPA or with DERM (local env. resource dept.). I would love to work in any of those places, but the EPA jobs are all in DC, while DERM is local. it's like i don't wanna stay but i know it'll be rough if i move. u see my predicament?? i guess i have until like march, april the lastest, cuz then i have to start applying for jobs b4 i leave the one i currently have. it's gonna be strange not going to school. even though i complaint a lot about it, i'm gonna miss it. 

So my sister had the baby. she's soooo cute!! she was a premie, so she was a bit small when she was born. i was afraid to carry her until like 2 weeks ago. i didn't wanna break her or something. she was just so small. but now i grab her and i talk to her and she just stares at me. it's so funny. i was playing with my computer the other day and i put her on my lap and she was like fascinated by the screeen. it was super cute. alex turned 2 years old on the 13th. i can't belive how big he is. i remember leaving work early to run to the hospital cuz my sister was about to give birth. time just flies. we took a family portrait the other day and our family has gotten so big. it was just 3 of us and now there's 8 of us, with my sisters, their husbands, and their kids. it's funny. my aunt was bugging me the other day saying that now that the 2 girls have kids, that it's my turn. btw, she doesn't know i'm gay, but who knows, maybe in the future, but for now, i''ll stay kid free. 

on sad news, two FIU students, Janelle Bertor, and Tony Perez died last week. I didn't know both of them personally, but Tony was a huge supporter of DLP, and it was extremely sad when i heard about his death. there was a candlelight vigil held for them last thursday in school, it was extremely sad. it was great however, to see how many people showed up to pay their respects, and to see how much they were loved. it's situations like these that show you how short life is, how you have to live it to the fullest, and how you can't let one day pass by w/o telling those you love how much you care about them. 

well, lunch time at work. i'm gonna go get some grub. i dunno what to get though, my stomach has been acting up since this morning.

At first I was afraid, I was petrified, 

When you said you had 10 inches, Lord I almost died! 

But I'd spent so many years just waiting for a man that long,  

That I grew strong, and I knew that I could take you on....  

But  there you are, another lie,  I was ready for a big mac and you've bought me a French fry!  

I should have known that it was bullshit, just a sad pathetic dream,  

Should have known there was no anaconda lurking in those jeans!  

Go on now go, walk out the door,  

Don't you promise me 10 inches, then turn up with only 4!  

Weren't you a brat to think I wouldn't catch you out!?  

Don't you know we're only joking when we say size doesn't count???! 

(Chorus) 

 I will survive! I will survive! 

'Cos as long as I have batteries, My sex life is gonna thrive!  

I will always have good sex with a handful of latex!  I will survive! 

I will survive!. . .Hey! Hey! 

It took all my self control not to laugh out loud, 

When I saw your little weiner standing tall and proud! 

But to hell with all your egos and to hell with all your needs  

Now I'm saving all my lovin' for a cordless multispeed! 

(Chorus) 

I will survive! I will survive! 

'Cos as long as I have batteries, My sex life is gonna thrive!  

I will always have good sex with a handful of latex! 

I will survive! I will survive!. .Hey! Hey!"

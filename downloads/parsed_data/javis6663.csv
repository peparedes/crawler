You seduce people by tapping into their dreams and desires.
And because of this sensitivity, you can be the ideal lover for anyone you seek.
You are a shapeshifter - bringing romance, adventure, spirituality to relationships.
It all depends on who your with, and what their vision of a perfect relationship is.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","Happy New Years to all you groovy cats and foxxy ladies!
I defy anyone to end the year worse than i did.  It shouldn't be that hard really, but try it anyway.  I ended 2004 trying to reason with my mom (muy imposible btw) on the phone at a high volume at The Big Ni's (Sarah Niehaus) house (which kicks ass btw).  The result, i dont get to go to Amy's party, and I get to go home.  Parents are the sucksorz.  I wanna get my mom in a boxing ring, just so we could have it out. The funny thing is, somewhere in there, i think i threatened to ram her in the head.  After i said it, i thought it was the dumbest thing i have ever said. And those were my exact words........""I'm gonna ram you in the head.""   Man, I'm a loser.  Before i left about a million people showed up at sarah's and Colleen, who is this kickass, attractive red-maybe-strawberry-blonde chick, proposed to sarah and sang and danced to ""I would walk 500 miles"".  it was the funniest thing i had seen all day.  And did i mention sarah's house is the coolest?  Mostly because the upstairs used to be the downstairs.  the kitchen, living room, everything is upstairs cause it used to be a one story house, then they just lifted it up and added to the bottom after they got flooded.  It's my favorite house so far."

"event","Well last night was funny fun fun.  I actually kow something on keyboards now, but it's actually something i listen to on a regular basis. Seven Nation Army, and it is easier than pissing on yourself.  But something is better than nothing right?  Moving on.  I chilled at Brett's ALL DAY and learned that on Chris Champagne's keyboard, then Cameron, Andrew, and Greg came over. Everybody practiced for a while, except cameron who just sat back and soaked it all in.  Around 6 maybe 6:30, we left for Covington Point Country Club, which is down one of the darkest, scariest fuxing roads ever.  I missed the turn to that road, so i went to turn down another to turn around.  This time i found THE darkest and scariest mother fuxing road in the universe.  Me, Greg, and Cameron swore something scary, like Ron Jeremy, was gonna jump out of the woods and kill us and steal the keyboard.  But then we got there and waited for everyone else, cause im deaf and can't hear Ducre trying to call me, so he had to go get him and Hannah.  Once they got there, everyone set up, and Travis, which btw it was his birthday party, played with some ok Punk band made of a bunch of other freshmen.  One of them had a butt cape that said ""the addicts"".  We couldn't help but laugh cause it waved in the wind when he walked.  Then Brett and Travis jammed for a bit, then Paul, Dennis, Timmy, Billy, and Marcie showed up out of nowhere.  Oh yeah and just before that, we passed Cameron out.  After brett and Travis were done, Ducre and Greg got there shiat together and then they all played some good shit.  After a while Travis got tired of having to constantly pull his shitty bass drum back cause it moves everytime he hits it, so i volunteered to sit in front of it.  Fun shiat.  Seeing as i am deaf anyway, it didn't bother me a bit.  It wasnt much different from sitting in Arun's room while they practiced the day before Brett's party, or when Travis, Brett, and Ducre jammed in Ducre's garage.  After it was all over, Brett and Andrew took turns melting my face off with their guitars.  Oh jeez, oh jeez. i think i creamed my pants at one point during andrew's turn.  Then we went to the God of Restaurants.  The one, the only, Mandeville Waffle House.  No manager had showed up that day so they didnt have any hamburger meat.  My entire universe fell apart for a minute.  I was so lost with out my bacon cheeseburger quarter plate.  Instead I got Double Waffle's with Triple Hashbrowns, smothered and chunked, some eggs, and bacon.  Huge.  Then I had to leave cause my mom is an anal retentive cunt, who hasnt got any since her and my dad split up.  Long time ago if you know what i mean (1990ish). I get in my car and start heading home, when i notice, hey i still have brett's bass and amp along with Champagne's keyboard, and they are already gone.  Shit, now i have to babysit this stuff.  The bright side is, now my mom and grandma know what a bass guitar is, cause i want one for Xmas. I gotta go let my stupid sister's cat outside cause it wont stop Meowing."

I just saw donnie darko for the first time, and i cannot concieve the existence of a movie that can pale in comparison.  oh, and when i realized that sarah white's lj icon was from that movie, i freaked out and called stevie.  I feel like i connected with the movie on so many levels i dont know where to start.  It's like, i think like him sometimes.  Not the whole emotional problems thing, but the other uber deep shit.  And gretchen looks like this girl i know, mellisa, she went to my school last year and now she's engaged.  OMG wormholes!
I'm trying to read the Philosophy of time travel thing right now, but its hard cause the image is shitty. I'll have to put it on a bigger tv screen.  

I LOVE DONNIE DARKO!"

As of right now my mind is on this whole Hurrican incident. They are bringing over 25,000 people here to San Antonio, so I'll hopefully be going to the Red Cross offices either today or tomorrow to do the application and go through the orientation. They said they already have enough help for this month, but starting in October and for another 3-4 months after they are going to need help. I'm SOOOOOO there! I can't wait. I'm bursting with excitement at the fact that I get to do something and meet this people, and help them. I'll be going on my days' off, twice a week. I'll let everyone know how that goes as well. Hope to talk to you all soon... XOXOX"

"event","This is so CUTE! i'm sucha matchmaker! Melanie met JR, (an OLD family friend, his parents are my sisters godparents) when he came down for the wedding (his mom was maid of honor, dad walked my mom down the isle, sister was a brides maid, MELANIE was a bridesmaid and he was a grooms man). I KNEW she'd like him, but wasn't sure about him. So sunday before he leaves, him and i stayed up talkin til 6 am, and he tells me that he was into Melanie. I got SO excited! WOOHOO! He said ""i've never met a girl who intrigued me so much. She's like a female version of ME."" and just rambled on about her. Well. He is going to spain for 3 months to work in a 5-star restaurant (he's a chef), and he also lives in Jacksonville, so he just was a little bummed cause he knew him and mel had a slim chance of ever going further. So he leaves back to Florida, and of course I've been waiting 2 days to squeal all this information to melanie. She gets SUPER excited, cause she feels the same about him. I'm just CUPID! lol! Before he left I gave him Melanie's number. ""I hate talkin on the phone christina, i don't know about this."" ""Well JR, just keep it, and if you ever think about her, give her a call... maybe she'll change your mind about talkin on the phone."" 

<lj-cut text=""The Love story continues, pictures included..."">
I talked to him during the week and told him ""OMG Melanie felt the same about YOU!!!!!!!!!!!"" YAY! What happens? Sunday after my mom's wedding (that same week that i told him she liked him too) HE CALLS HER! woohoo! They've been talkin EVERYDAY since. And he comes online and gushes about melanie, and melanie calls me every other day GUSHING about JR. SO i'm just in the middle of this developing love story.
WELL... Like i said, JR is going to Spain for 3 months, in the beginning of May. So mel's like ""man that SUCKS, i just don't know about this."" ""Well MEL, why don't you GO TO SPAIN and VISIT!!!!!"" ""nah, that's crazy, he's gonna be working, and it's so expensive"" I keep pressing it and I look up ticket prices for her, and everything. AND...so she decides, SHE'S GOING TO SPAIN to see HIM!!!!!! for 2 weeks in July. YAY! He was SO happy.  

I have no idea where all this is gonna go. He is VERY focused in his career as a chef, and is VERY determined to open his own 5-star restaurant by the time he's 27 (he's got 5 years! i think he'll do it!) and mel's very focused in her schooling to be a doctor. But the thing is, by the time they are both done, they will both be 27 and could possibly work something out. WHO KNOWS?! 

here's mel and JR takin some Jello shots at cowboys...the love story began...3/31/05... LOL!

I'm so happy for her though, cause through it all, she is just so happy and seems so content. I make fun of her calling her J-Lo cause this is her 4th MARRIAGE! and she's only 41! (LOL!) but I can only pray that this is it for her, that she has FINALLY found happiness in Hayward for the rest of her life. Family and friends started comin in last night from out of town, and a couple more today, now THAT just makes it seem more real, like YAY! it's finally HERE! My cousins came in from Florida last night 10:30... I was EXHAUSTED from running around ALL day, and my cousin JR was on FIRE, he was like ""TINA?! girl! where the party AT?! I'm in SAN ANTONIO! let's go out!!!"" UMMM?! It's almost 11 at night! Freakin Puerto Ricans man! I tell ya! CRAZY and never willing to relax just for a little bit. So I called up my best friend and figured I'd show them the TEXAS way to party... at a country western club! hahah We went to Cowboys at like midnight. They actually loved it, so I'm happy about that. and we had a great time.. I'll post pics soon. Bad thing is we got in at 3 am...and am awake now at 9. WOOO... I'm writing this ONLY cause I got a few extra minutes while my hot rollers are in my hair, but today is gonna be INSANE. I have rehersal, then the rehersal dinner... I still gotta find SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!! so more shopping around, along with a couple more errands. It's ALMOST over... and I know tomorrow is gonna zoom by, so I'm just trying to take it all in and enjoy the company, along with thank Jehovah that everyone arrived safely and has a good time. -Chris"

So I was late again today by 3 minutes, and I talked to my manager and he told me I have 9 tardies so far THIS MONTH! OMG.. and I thought i was doing GOOD gettin to work on time! i was so surprised. SO yea they are gonna fire me I'm sure of it. :( I'm so worried about that! I can't afford to be out of work at all. I'm moving out soon and I have bills to pay. SUCKS... I'm gonna be on vacation for the next 5 days because my mom is gettin' married this Saturday, so now i have to wait in wonder if when i go back Tuesday, if they're gonna let me go or not. My manager was like ""well i don't know, the HR department is the one that dictates that, I have no control over it"" WHATEVER! jerk! that's such bullshit. I KNOW they've bent the rules for CRAZY amounts of people. He was like ""well we are cracking down on tardies and absences."" GRRRRRRR... Guess I'll just pray...

"event","I haven't updated recently. Been going through this little stage of depression the past week or so. One of my ""omg i miss oscar"" moments, actually more like ""I miss being with somebody"" moments. Just been thinking alot about him and how he is doing, what's going on in his life. I've tried calling and he's been avoiding me completely. Maybe it's better that way...even though it hurts. 

I've been reading this book called ""good in bed"" by Jennifer Weiner that i can COMPLETELY relate to it's kinda scary. It's about this plus size girl that breaks up with her no good boyfriend and her regaining her strength and inner self. She struggles with 'bouts of lonliness and depression and ""wow did i make a mistake? did i let ""the one"" go? is anyone else gonna love me?"" There's this part that had me cryin my eyes out because it was so close to how I've been feeling. She's in the doctor's office pouring her heart out, and I can just relate so much. Plus what the doctor tells her is so true... Here's the passage:
       
                 I blinked hard against the tears. Wordlessly, Dr. K, handed me a box of Kleenex. He \
           took off his glasses and pressed two fingers against the bridge of his nose. 
                    ""I'm a bad person,"" I blubbered. He looked at me kindly.
                    ""Why? Because you broke up with him? That's silly. How could you know this was 
           going to happen?""
                    ""No,"" I said. ""I know I couldn't. But now, its like...all I want is to be there 
           for him, and love him, and he won't let me, and I feel so... alone.""
                   ""He sighed. ""Its hard when things end. Even if nobody dies, even if you part 
           on the best possible terms, and tehre's nobody else involved. Even if you're the one 
           who lets  go firest. It's never east. It always hurts.""
                   ""I just feel like I made this huge mistake. Like I didn't think things through. 
           I thought I knew...how it would feel to be apart from him. But I didn't. I couldn't. I 
           never imagined anything like this. And all I do is miss him..."" I swallowed hard, choking 
           on another sob. I couldn't explain it- that I'd been waiting my whole life for a guy would 
           get me, who would understand my pain. I thought I'd known what pain was, but I knew 
           now I'd never hurt this way. 
                                                  -""Good in Bed"" Jennifer Weiner
                                                    Chapter 7 pg 115-116

Wooo. weird! so close to how I've been feeling. I'm almost done with the book and it's pretty empowering how she gets over this mountain. I know I will. I know I have, I just stumble a little, gotta dust myself off and keep going. I know I'm so much of a stronger person, I know that things are better this way. I just can't help but have my moments of wonder and worry, and hurt. I was engaged, I was in love with him, 2 years... I know it takes time to heal and I can't expect myself to just ""get over it"" in 5 months... but if i do say so myself, I think i'm doing a pretty good job. Thank Jehovah for giving me strength! I know I've been praying alot. It's allllllll gonna be OOOOOOK. -Chris"

Melanie totaled her truck, and she only has liability insurance, which means she has this messed up truck that she can't drive, yet she still has to make payments on. She needs to get another vehicle, but that's double payments, WHICH MEANS she may not be able to afford moving out in MAY! NOOOOO! WHY! She's gonna try to take out a student loan and pay her totaled truck, so if she does that, then she'll be able to still move out. I'm crossing my fingers! I have been looking forward to leaving my house in may, that would SUCK if I couldn't. I would be so devastated. AT the same time, mistakes do happen, and I'm just extremely greatful that she is ok. *sigh... BLAH

Tomorrow I'm supposed to go hang out with Jeff. SUPER hot guy, like WOAH. I don't know what he wants from me, but he already knows i'm not looking for a relationship. I hope he can understand that, and we'll still be great friends. BLAH! lol

Now school starts again on Monday and I'm crying cause I seriously don't wanna go back. But there's only 2 months left, so thank GOD for summer!

My Kenny Chesney concert got POST-PONED!!! It was supposed to be tonight, but they made an announcement last week because Kenny sliped on some stairs and sprained his ankle. AWWW! So Now the concert is scheduled for May 15th. YESS! I turn 21 May 9th, so that means I can DRINK margarita's at the CONCERT! Pure BLISSSSS! Only a month and some days before I turn 21! I am so excited. More excited because I won't be stamped with ""M"" for MINOR on my hands anymore when I go out. I HATE that! I feel so childish! I'm not a big drinker, but it's still gonna be nice to have that option to drink if I was in the mood. So YAY! ALMOST THERE!! Then it's all downhill from there! lol

I went out last night to the Gary Allen concert. He was SOOO close! and SUPER hot. JEEZ! god spent a little EXTRA time on that guy! pure sexiness... lol. He put on a great show, and it was PACKED at the club. We had a great time though. I'll post pics when i get home later! ;)

I've been looking for a house BIG time lately. It's got me so stressed. I have to find a house AT LEAST by beginning of June. Sascha is coming from Germany! And he needs to have a place to STAY! So i'm on a time crunch here. I talked to a real estate agent though and she said since I'm looking now I should have no problem getting into a house by mid May, beginning June. I CAN'T WAIT!!! Finally on my own. YESSSS! 

I've been dating a good amount lately. But I think I'm gonna slow down on that cause the guys are just wanting to move so quickly. No one knows how to be FRIENDS first without wanting to jump 10 feet ahead in the game. Its so over whelming! I miss Oscar alot, especially in those uncomfortable, awkward moments. It sucks. :( I've tried calling him, but he's avoiding me. I guess it's better that way. 

That's all that is really new lately... Gotta get back to work kiddos! Lots of love always! -Chris"

THEN i went out on Saturday to see Kevin Fowler (Texas country music artist, he's great love him!) at Floor's Country Store, and my ear got SOOO infected and my throat got SUPER swollen to the point where i couldn't swallow. I tried to stick it out for the whole concert, but during the opening act (I don't know who they were, but the lead singer was HOT as HELL! woo!) I was in MASSIVE pain. But I paid $15 to get in, and I wanted to see KEVIN! I could only watch 2 songs though cause as soon as the girls started screaming (it was SOO packed) I was like, I gotta get Outta here! My friends were great about it all, cause they know i've been sick for the passed 2 weeks. I just took mel's truck home and they stayed. The thing that SUCKS is i took some motrin and it went away within 30 min! :( oh well wasn't meant for me to stay...

I met this guy Jesse, he's younger then me by a couple months but he is SO mature. I REALLY enjoy talking to him. We have been talkin every night til like 3 am, for just 2-3 hours straight. I love that I told him i am studying with the witnesses and he is OK with that. I LOVE that he can hold a decent conversation and is NOT a pervert at all. (he's actually a virgin, and I like that about him cause he doesn't expect anything out of me.) SO FAR, he is a fun guy, really sweet, witty, talented (he can play the guitar like WOAH! amazing), smart, goal oriented... But, On the other hand i am still so skeptical and scared to get attached to anyone. I don't know if i am fully ready to date out of fear of getting hurt. BLAH... Anyway like Sascha tells me, ""take your time and GO WITH THE FLOW, quit over thinking everything"" I'm TRYING! Easier said then done...-Chris"

WHY! the Bachelorette is so stupid! I didn't even watch the last episode yet (I recorded it), but I turn on the tv, and she's up there with JERRY, talkin about they already broke up!!! She shouldn't have CHOSE him to begin with! She was fightin with him like 3 episodes ago, that should have thrown up a sign that hey!! he may be IMPOSSIBLE and a big PAIN in the BUTT! STUPID girls i tell ya! She probably would have been better off with the other guy. I'm not even gonna watch the episode now! that's such a WASTE! GRRRR! I missed American Idol for THAT!

I have slacked off about looking for a house. It's a TOUGH process and most of the houses in my area are going up for SALE not RENT. PLUS it's gonna be tough cause it's 4 college students, which make some people uneasy, so I'm hoping we'll get some openminded people who can tell we aren't crazy party animals that do drugs and get drunk every weekend. *crosses fingers again* I need luck! I'm so picky though about a house. I don't want it to look RAGGEDY! lol! and GHETTO... I'm gonna be payin rent i want it to look decent, right?! My dad was like ""who cares you aren't buying"" UMM yes, but i don't want the roof to be leakin in my bed, or it to be so ugly people cringe when they look at it. The area we are lookin in generally has some really nice homes, so we shouldn't have TOOO much trouble. 

I'm so excited my Kenny Chesney concert is comin up in like 3 weeks. It's already sold out! i knew that'd happen! thank god i got the tickets the day they went on sale. He's my FAV! rawr! and Gretchen Wilson will be his opening act! She's the best! YESSssssssssss!

***********************************************************************

Not much has been happening my way. I'm so addicted to the internet, I seriously wonder if it's a problem. I can't stay away! I know so many people online, and talk to so many people on a regular basis, it's insane. I was online on sunday for like 8-9 hours. What a waste of a day if you think about it afterward. But I get so lost into the computer, so many different conversations, then I just lose track of how long I have actually been sitting here. Ehhh anyway

I started talking to this guy Isaac. Funny thing is we met like 3-4 years ago in a chatroom and he knew this girl i went to school with at the time. So we used to chat and stuff then, and of course lost touch. I was bored and in a san antonio chat like last week, and him and i start talkin again, not knowing that we had talked before. We even chatted on the phone that night for like an hour and a half. Then the next day he asks me if I've talked to Rosa Linda (which was the girl we both new) and it clicked. OMG! lol whatta coincedence! He said he knew i looked familiar and finally realized the connection. Pretty weird. I guess we were meant to be in each other's lives some how. We talked for like 3-4 hours total last night, he is a great guy so far. Has a degree already, and seems to have his priorities straight. I'm scared to finally meet him in person, cause I'm so insecure, but I'm just gonna be myself, and if he doesn't like that, then oh well... NEXT! We are going to see Hitch on Thursday! Woo-hoo a date! I'm terrified of dating again, but it's been 5 months since Oscar and I broke up, and it's time i move on with my life. I wonder if this is too soon? Am I really ready? I have no idea. I can only pray and keep it in Jehovah's hands to give me strength. 

School has been going great. I am doing good in my classes, keeping up with my studies. My anthropology class is soooo COOL! I wish I wasn't such an emotional person, cause it seems like such a FUN profession. Today we looked at more photo's of crime scenes. Pretty gruesome stuff. Decomposed bodies, nasty wounds, the works. You have to have a tough stomach, not only for what you SEE, but the SMELL!!! I can't even IMAGINE. Last week was neat cause my professor had one of his police officer friends come and role play a dead body. They set up a Mock Crime scene, with bullets, the officer had blood all on his shirt, and everything, and he even lied down in this awkward position for an HOUR, while we went in and took down all the evidence, made sketches of the scene, identified him, and tried to figure out how he was killed and what happened. I was SO excited! Talk about HANDS ON learning! Today we also looked at REAL skulls that have been donated to my professor for learning purposes, and we were learning how to identify just by looking at the skull if it's a male or female. I was amazed by all of this, down to the jaw line, the brow bridge, the actual skull itself you can tell the sex! wow! 

I had the WEIRDEST dream the night before last. I dreamt that i KNEW i was gonna die, and I had this huge dinner and was saying goodbye to everyone. I mean everyone was crying, and I was saying my final words to each individual, even people I have never met before. Then I got to my baby brother, and I remember just crying My EYES out with him, I mean holding him so tight and balling so hard, and just repeatedly telling him that i love him. Then I woke up, and Jacob was crying! STRANGE!!!!!!!!!! What does that MEAN?! GRRR! 

I need to start exercising! I hate it SOOO much! i can never stay motivated! EVER! But Then I watched Oprah on Monday, and this Man was 700 POUNDS, and lost 500 pounds without surgery or any pills.. just dieting and eating correctly! I was amazed, and cryin my eyes out watching this! I couldn't believe it! He looked GREAT!! He is now my inspiration. If he can lose all that weight, then SO CAN I!!!! damnit!

"event","HEY YALLLLLLL! man it's been WEEKS since i've updated. I'm ADDICTED to the internet, and am on EVERYDAY, for hours, but I just get caught up in the message boards. Summer has been whining about updating, so here it goes.......




LOL ok.. hmmm.. not much has been happening! I have been busy with work, pulling a couple double shifts here and there, but the same ol' crap. I found out in the middle of January that I had made $1 million in sales for Sears last year. WOW! I was SOO Proud of myself! That's not easy to do! Especially in telemarketing. That puts me in as one of the top sales people for Sears in the Nation! WOO-HOOO *dances on the sofa* Go me! go ME! oh oh! LOL...

I haven't had a study in about 3 and a half weeks. *cries* I think about it everyday, and I feel horrible. I've gone to the meetings though on my Sundays off! But that's still not enough. I think that maybe I should ask a sister in the congregation to meet with me weekly for studies, instead of my stepmom, cause at least then I'll FORCE myself to go, instead of getting caught up with the internet. My stepmom get's caught up in work and stuff too, and we keep sayin ""ok, we'll have a study tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, Saturday for SURE!"" and well... 3-4 weeks later, here I am. :( Satan has a WAY to keep you away from Jehovah! I'm strugglin, and need some support to keep me on track! HELP! what should i do?! Is this normal?!

My anthropology class is so neat! I know that Trish asked to be updated. ;) I don't know if I could be a CSI, cause MAN the things they see and have to go through! My teacher said the show is WAY off, and it's not really THAT exciting all the time. haha... We saw pictures of DEAD people, i mean dead in all kinds of ways. Murdered, heart attacks, natural causes, decomposed bodies... (WARNING! THIS IS GRAPHIC!)We saw a picture of a lady who was pregnant, and had a heartattack. She lived alone, so when they found her 2 weeks later, her body was SO bloated that the gasses and such PUSHED her baby out. It looks like her nanny exploded LITERALLY. I CRIED when i saw that. She was BLUE, and WHITE, and the dead baby was HANGING out of her dead... OMG! woo.. i get chills thinking about it. He says these types of things happen ALL the time. They find dead bodies everywhere, and thousands go unfound because of various reasons, especially those left in the woods. SOOOOOO yea.. yesterday we were learning about search techniques during crime scenes. He says it can take hours and hours, even days and weeks to finish a crime scene. There's SO much reporting, and pictures of EVERY angle to take. I'll keep yall posted some more as the class goes on!"

"event","I called into work this morning, i just felt like crap. I have the WORST allergies, can barely even breath out my nose. I hate it. I did go to the meeting though, wasn't too sick for that! It was really interesting. I sat in the second row, so I was like glued to Brother Carter when he spoke. He was talking about our relationship with Jehovah, and how to not do things we know he will disapprove of, things that our conscience would eat us up for and we know are bad. He was saying that Jehovah is like our best friend, one that we can confide in, one who we'd try everything in our power to never betray, one we can ALWAYS, no matter what, count on. It's so amazing getting to know the type of person Jehovah is. His love is so grand, and it's just sad that so many people turn their backs to wanting a relationship with Him. They have no idea what they are missing! 

The watchtower spoke to ME today. I'm learning my limits with alcohol, and it was a perfect study for me. I have had my ""drunkard"" moments lately, but it's because i'm not sure what my body can and can't tolerate until i'm praying to the porcelin god the next morning! lol. It's all a process...to be able to enjoy it but not over-indulge. I'm learning...

I'm still so heart broken over my Brad Pitt and Jennifer's breakup! WHY!? they were the cutest couple! Seemed so happy.. she couldn't just give him a baby and shut up. So what if she has 12 movies in the works, she'll never win an oscar! LOL Selfish WOMAN! My poor brad is in pain! :( and so am i! Lmao.. guess it's true when they say ""things aren't always what they seem...""

Friday i saw Coach Carter- good movie, I liked it. I'm going to be a high school teacher, so it's so empowering! Tonight my parents and their friends are going salsa dancing and i'm stuck babysitting 4 kids and twin baby girls (they are like 4 months) OH GOD! Please Jehovah save me! lol"

I started class today and i'm so excited about my physical anthropology class! My professor is forensic scientist for the san antonio police dept at night and teaches during the day. We are gonna' be doing the COOLEST things in that class! He has so many connections and access to so much stuff. We are going to be looking at real photos of crime scenes, he's gonna do a mock crime scene with all this evidence, fake blood, a body, everything. He's gonna plot a fake body in the woods and teach us how to find clues to locate the body... we are also going to reconstruct a face from just using a skull with clay. WOOO all kinds of neat things. I'm so excited...I love hands-on type classes. That's why i love it at the community college! At the university the classes are WAY too big (300-400 kids) and obviously they can't be so hands-on, but at the Comm. college the classes are like 25 kids a class, so all my classes are like that. I love it.  

Bachelorette started tonight!!! I recorded it cause i was at work and school, i'll watch it tomorrow. WOOO I'm excited. All my shows are gonna' start up again. American Idol, ONE TREE HILL, Oprah, Dr. Phil, Apprentice, Everwood... I'm such a tv junkie...*sigh

YAY!!! it's about time! I was tired of looking at that collage of Oscar and I. (Cammie it was beautiful girl thank you!) I'm on a new chapter in my life, unfortunately without him... 

Well, I'm no longer getting an apartment, I'm moving into a HOUSE with melanie, and my other best friend Jayme and her fiance. We figured it'd be ALOT cheaper to split an $800-$900 rent and bills between 4 people, then 2. So YAY! The apartments here are running for as much as a house, so might as well not settle. We are all so excited. I never thought I'd live with a guy, but it's just jason! Him and Jayme have been together for 5 years (today's their anniversary actually) and are getting married after college. YAY for them! Me and Mel feel comfortable with him though, so it's all good. Plus he has the CUTEST husky, Nova, gotta' love the doggie! Jason said he'd keep up with the yard work if he never had to do dishes. Ummm J, you have a DEAL buddy! just never stick my ass out in the HEAT, i'll seriously PASS OUT! lol...We are looking to move in June-ish, after finals. 

I talked to that guy that my friend wanted me to talk to from the dating service. He seems nice, but I'm still SOO skeptical. I cried so much that night, cause honestly, even though I'm not with Oscar anymore, and know 

*** finishing entry, i submitted an unfinished cause my friends came to visit me! I feel so special*** 

ummm where was i? Oh yea, I know I'm not with Oscar anymore, and know that things will never be again between us, but man I don't know if I'm ready to move on just yet. To start dating again? That's a HUGE step. To even imagine starting over right now? oh man.. i just can't. The guy's name is Richard, he's very successful, very stable, he has a degree in Nuclear Medicine and in school for his master's degree. He is 30 though! ahhh! Wtf?! He was very nice, we had a great conversation, but man... I'm being SUPER cautious. I told myself the next guy that comes in my life is gonna' have to cross over alot of barriers. I'm scared to get hurt, afraid to put myself out there right now. But don't want to be mean to anyone and hurt anyone else in the process. I told this to him and he said he's not in a rush for anything, but I'm not so sure about that? I haven't called him back, cause I don't want to lead him on. I'm so stuck! BLAH!

My friends came to visit me! Miles, (my first boyfriend from like my sophomore year in high school, he's my BEST guy friend now. I love him to pieces, and of course he's a hottie. We have been through SO much together, through thick and thin!) Tyrone (OMG he's so GORGEOUS *drool* Those eyes of his, breathtaking...I had the BIGGEST crush on him freshman year) and William (man, me and him go WAY back, I used to hate him when we first met in 8th grade science class, then later that year became best friends! haha funny how things work) all came over (with thier friend Xavier). I haven't seen Tyrone and Will since high school, and I haven't seen miles in about an year or so, even though we talk ALL the time, we just never hang out together. It was great seeing all of them. Even though I was so reluctant cause man I've gained a TON of weight, but that's all my fault, and hopefully next time I see them their jaws will drop! :-D (i'll make sure of it!) I took pictures, so I'll try and post them on here soon... Well this is long enough, so I'm outs..."

If only money grew on trees, that'd be so lovely. The cheapest one we saw wasn't available to view until next week, but it's like a loft, so we are excited to go back next week. We have to keep looking though, cause we don't want to be jumping into anything we can't truley afford, or that we'll struggle with. 

My friend Maritza is a CRAZY puerto rican man... Today leaves me a voice message saying she needs a huge favor. So me, being the GREATEST friend in the world call her immediately saying, whatever it was i'll help her out. WELLL... she works for a dating service and said that there's this guy there that is just having ""bad luck"" with the girls he's been dating. She said she's known him for a while and he's a great guy, stable, educated (has a bachelor's degree and going for a master's),  blah blah blah... she said she told him about me and wanted to see if I could talk to him, maybe go on a date. UMMM!!??? i guess?! I didn't know what to say! I'm not sure if i'm ready to date again! BUT stability is what i want, so I don't know if i should pass up the opportunity. We'll see what happens!

I am moving out with my best friend melanie. YAY! Time to move on with my life, start becoming more independent, and responsible. I'm so excited. We are looking to move some time in May/June... it's not soon ENOUGH! It's a scary thought, but i try not to think about it too much cause then I'll change my mind. I'm such a daddy's girl, so I know I want to live like no more then 20 min from home. Easy access to my family, and my precious baby brother. (I can't be awaay from him too long without his hugs and kisses! lol)  I'm gonna' be 21 already (in may) so I think this is a good age to move on my own, it's a fact of life. I was a little adament about it because of my studies and making it to the meetings if I lived on my own, but Good thing is that Melanie is encouraging of my studies so I am sure that I will stay on track, and with prayers I know I'll be fine.  

I'm ready for a day off... I'm ready for a new JOB!!!!! Please Jehovah give me strength not to QUIT! lol. Have you ever felt that you about HAD it with work?! that if they say/do ONE more thing, just ONE MORE thing to piss you off, that's it... you are gonna' walk out! Well yea, I'm having one of those moments. I've been with Sears for 2 years already, I think I need a change. I'm lookin to apply to USAA (insurance) for customer service, they pay ALOT more then what I make, and it'll be easier doing inbound calls. It's just getting around to it that's the problem. got to make room christina....... or i'll go CRAZYYYYY!"

The assembly was GREAT. I went last sunday, and man I loved it. I wrote a good amount about it, and saved it, so I'll post it soon... I was just so into every talk, and I felt so overjoyed to be there, learning. I learned ALOT. My studies are going great. I just wish I could make it to all the meetings. :( I have to work every other sunday, I'm sure Jehovah understands...

I fell at work on New years Eve. An UGLY fall, I'm still in pain...I was comin in from lunch and stepped on this LITTLE rock (if you saw how small it was, you'd laugh)I swear the way I fell, you'd think it was a BOULDER! lol... I twisted my ankle on the rock, then lept forward to try and catch myself, and twisted my OTHER ankle, and fell Face forward on my stomach and chest. It knocked the wind out of me...My knee is all bruised, my chest is in pain and a little bruised and my ankle was really swollen, it's gotten better though. They were panicking at work, taking pictures and trying to send me to the emergency room. I was like ""Umm it's NEW YEARS EVE, i'm not about to spend it in the hospital over some clumsy fall, all they'll tell me is to put ice and take motrin."" Oh.. the story of my life I tell ya...

New Years Eve was fun. I went to a family friend's house party with my dad and sister. There were TONS and TONS of people there. All my family friends that I grew up with. There's like 10 of us kids that have just grown up together, we're all around the same age, between 19-24, 4 girls and like 6 guys. And there were some guys missing cause they are ALL in the military, and one was in Iraq, one was in washington dc, he works for the pentagon and had to work, and another is stationed somewhere else and they just couldn't make it home. It was just not the same, We were missing some links. Thank GOD my friend Junior is coming back from Iraq though tomorrow... he's going to germany first then will be back in the texas on the 9th. He was there for almost 2 years, and am so happy that he made it. It's a scary place out there. I drank, and for the first time... *drum roll please* no HANGOVER!! wooo! Christina is MAKING progress people! lol... My dad kept schooling me, like ""ok drink a little bit of water so you don't get dehydrated... eat a little bit."" So yea, I woke up and was fine the next day, with a little help from my daddy! (what would i ever do without him! lol) 

I was SOO tired at work on Sat. cause I had went out Thursday to Cowboys (a club), got home at 4:30 am, had to be at work by 8am, then partied new years, got home at 3am and had to be at work again by 10! I was working on PURE adrenaline. Don't ASK how i did it. I wanted to pass out on my desk, but i didnt! I'm so proud! The life of a college girl... I'm having FUN!!!"

An Australian mother was caught up in the rush of water from the tsunami with her 2 sons, ages 5 and 2, in each arm. She was forced to make a decision that NO mother should EVER have to make; which son to let go. It was either all three drowned, or she let one go and grab on to a near tree so that she and at least one son would survive. Being that the 5 yr old would most likely be able to fend for himself better, she told him, ""Doggy Paddle, just Doggy Paddle"" and let him go. Her husband stood by in a 3rd floor hotel room watching, helpless...

Devasted and extremely heartbroken, thinking her son was dead, like so many thousands, she recieved news that left her breathless... Her son had SURVIVED. He was found a few hours later, hanging on to a hotel door, in shock, and covered in mud, but ALIVE.. He had DOGGY PADDLED the whole time, 'til he was able to grab onto something. AWW... *tear, tear*

Get this... his REAL name.. is LUCKY!! talk about ironic...I was cryin my eyes out watching this story, it was so incredible how that little boy survived, and can you imagine that poor mother! I don't know if I could have made a decision like that! And let me tell ya he looked like a precious angel doll... God works in mysterious ways..."

"event","what's going on. I tried to update this thing the other day and something happened but it didn't post and then was deleted. 
I'm so TIRED. I went out again last night (yea on a wednesday, who'da thought?!). I went with my friends to a country-western club, Cowboys, to see Pat Green in concert. It was an awesome show. This is the second time I've seen Pat Green in like 2 months. The place was PACKED! We were like little sardines in there and it's a HUGE HUGE 2 floor club. I hate when it's like that cause I swear my boobs and ass were grabbed at least 687354 times! lol... You never know who it is! I HATE that! I'm like ""AHHH I feel so violated!"" I'm going again next week to see this guy who's in the Texas Mix (he only plays in clubs and concerts around Texas) Kevin Fowler... I'm excited cause I had a blast last night. I didn't get home til 3 am and then was late for work this morning! AHH! They are SO gonna' fire me. :( lol. It sucked cause I'm the only ""MINOR"" out of all my friends, I had these big UGLY ""M""s across my entire hand. I can't wait til i'm 21! Margarita's here i COME! only 5 more months baby!
Oscar came to see me at work last friday. OMG I was so shocked, and a little upset cause I've asked him not to show up at my job. I had no time to prepare myself, so my heart was in my stomach. Thankfully I had made other plans right after work, so I didn't feel too bad letting him down when he asked me to have lunch with him. He had this look in his eyes, like I can see that all kinds of emotions were running through him, as they were mine. We talked for like 10 minutes... I was STRONG! i didn't cry! and I love that feeling of strength. I've learned so much about myself, especially the fact that I didn't think I was this emotionally strong, even more so since I fel to emotionally drained when we broke up. I'm doing great, just having fun and doing things for ME. 
I'm going to an assembly on Sunday, and I'm pretty excited about it. I've been keeping up with my studies once a week, but I'm gonna' ask my stepmom if we can bump it to twice a week, cause I just feel so eager to learn. That Knowledge book is SOO interesting, and I am already learning alot. I pray every day that Jehovah helps me stay strong and not steer from him spiritually. 
Christmas is horrible, I only bought a gift for my mom and my dad, cause I'm trying to let go of that all... So far everyone understands, even though my mom is a little huffy about it, she's really the only one close to me who makes her little comments. I'm happy everyone has been supportive for the most part even if they don't agree with my beliefs. There's this lady that doesn't talk to me at work anymore since I decided to be ""one of them Jehovah's people"" LOL (SHE TOLD SOMEONE THAT! I died laughin) Some people are so ignorant. *rolls eyes*
I'm off for the next 3 days! FINALLY! SLEEP! I'm probably gonna' be going out, but hey it's all in good fun! I'm FREE!!!"

"event","I'm at work; tired, very tired. I of course, don't want to be here. I hate calling people at 8 am on a Saturday morning! It's the worst! 
""Ma'am don't ya know it's 8 in the damn morning on Saturday!?"" 
""Oh really Mr. Smith, I had no idea! I must live in a cave!"" *rolls eyes*
Anyway...

I've been working 10 hour shifts, (gotta' make that MONEY!) So I was so happy to finally have a day off yesterday. Not that I relaxed or anything! My dad called me at 9:30 to wash and clean my car so I can have it appraised. I was so mad! My first day off in 12 days, I wanted to sleep til at LEAST 12! So I woke up grumpy. I don't want to give up my car, but my ghetto, rican dad doesn't want to pay $700 for me to get a time belt change, so he said, ""WHAT?! $700?! Umm I don't think so, your trading that shit in!"" AHHH! *cries* Not my beloved HONDA. And I'm def. not about to trade in my HONDA for some little dodge NEON! lol It has been giving me alot of problems, if it's not one thing it's another, I just think he's tired of paying for all it's repairs when it's supposed to give me NONE. It took me 2 and a half hours to clean out and wash my car, and it looks SPECTACULAR, sparkling, just beautiful. So I take it to get appraised, and they told me that they'd give me ""4800 for it. WHAT?!!?!?! I about had a heartattack. My 2000 honda accord, 2 door, in GREAT condition, (they don't know about it's mechanical prob's and don't need to lol) 109,000 miles, and that's all they want to give me! Yes it has alot of miles, but it's a HONDA! it'll run another 150,000 EASILY. *sigh* so I have NO clue what my dad's gonna do Now! Hoepfully I can keep it! 

Oscar called me on Thursday while I was at work. I didn't know it was him because my cell said ""Private Call,"" so not knowing who it was I answered it. As soon as I heard him say ""Hey"" OMG!!!!!!! My heart dropped to my stomach. I was like ""Umm hey, what do you want"" I was so messed up. I talked to him for like 2 min but had to get back to work. I cried. I didn't have time to prepare myself emotionally, he just caught me off guard. I haven't talked to him in weeks, and man I've been doin SO good... haven't cried, nothin. Pshh! My manager at work immediately saw my face drop and was very supportive as I cried. It's been almost 2 months, and it's still so hard. He called me back later that night, and I answered it without checkin who it was first. Again, MISTAKE. This time I was more calm, a little rude to him though. He said he had went out with some girl and he felt horrible, like he was cheating on me. I told him he needs to move on with his life... which he started with the whole ""I miss you, I've realized what I've lost, I've changed, I still love you, I know you are the one for me"" AHHH I was torturing myself listening to him, but I just became so enraged, so hurt. ""It's a little too late for that Oscar"" was all I said.

I can feel myself getting stronger as a person. Standing up to him, not allowing myself to fall for his little outcry for attention. Yes I have my moments of weakness, but he doesn't know that, he hasn't heard me cry. I'm in total control, and it's so empowering. I've learned alot about myself from this whole experience, and in that sense, it's all worth it. Girls are just so weak, and we fall into these traps, settle for less when we KNOW we deserve better... I'm NOT about to do that, I will NEVER settle, cause I know I'm better then that.
This is long... sorry... I'm out! Peace and Love..."

"event","I've been missing Oscar alot today. Just thinking about him alot. It's so hard for me to hear country music, especially certain songs. He LOVED country music, when we were together in the car and going on our trips or just driving around, I remember how I used to love to hear him and watch him singing his heart out over EVERY song. (He knew them ALL by heart, and looked SO cute) And how we also would fight over me wanting to hear something else cause the music was driving me crazy! lol (I'll always LOVE my R &B!) 

I just have these moments where all I can see are flashbacks of something that happened, images of him, or us in my mind; I can hear his voice, hear his laughter, see his eyes light up when he'd smile at me. I often wonder if I hadn't broken up with him, how would I be? how would we be? I think it was done for the best, but I can't help but miss him so much. I'm trying to be strong, trying to stay busy, trying with all of my being to stay sane. I pray alot...maybe not enough? There are times where I'm proud of myself for standing up for who I am, refusing to go through all the madness with him, but then there are times where I feel incredibly weak, so vulnerable, and I often feel as if maybe I gave up on him and should have been stronger, in his time of weakness. I am NOT gonna' call him though, and I'm NOT gonna' give up on myself...I will get through this............ I hope."

"event","Yea... went out Friday night and Last night...I'm TIRED. I haven't slept REAL good for a couple days. (My own fault of course) I DIDN'T drink!! WOOO! *booty dances* GO me Go me! lol ok lemme stop lyin. I drank a little less then half a cup of vodka with sprite but 1 it tasted yucky (no where NEAR as good as my Pineapple with vodka), and 2 Melanie was SOO drunk and i wasn't about to let her drive.

The party we went to last night was alot of fun, ALOT of people were there, and I met some really cool people. However I was just watching how STUPID people get when they are WASTED. Seriously what is the point? I mean I've had my share of drinks, but it's cause I'm not experienced and am learning my body's limits, but there was this girl there that kept complaining how GROSS the tequila shots were, but the dumbass kept drinkin it! THEN she started drinkin some other hard liquor and could barely open her eyes. She looked like sucha moron. Ummm... STUPID!!! I wanted to take it away from her but then they'd kick me out and say ""we didn't invite our mom's for a reason!"" LOL... 

We got in at about 4:30, and i had to be at work at 10 this morning. Starbucks coffee didn't work for me this morning! I'm sooo draggin my butt around wanting to pass out here on my desk at work. Only 15 more minutes til I can go home... 15 more minutes..."

Last night I came home SOOO tired, but I promised Kathy (my stepmom) that I'd do a bible study with her when I got home. Wanting to ask to wait another day, I heard my inner voice saying ""No No No! Don't give up on a study! You let him win!"" (Him being Satan) And i was NOT about to let that happen. So I took a deep breath and prayed to Jehovah to give me the strength, and energy to stay awake and ABSORB all the information. We started the Knowledge book and BOY is that INTERESTING! I'm even MORE excited! I didn't want to stop after the 1st chapter, but it was already 12:30 at night and I had to be up at 6 this morning for work. I'm hoping I can get another study in either tonight or tomorrow. 
I've been feeling alot better emotionally lately. Like my strength is slowly coming back. I haven't cried in a while, and I think because I haven't talked to Oscar its made it's made it a lot easier. He wants his ring back, but I'm not at the point where I completely want to let go of it all. I have my moments where I think about him, when I miss him tremendously, but I try to repeat to myself that this breakup is for the better. I KNOW i'm going to be ok. 
Well... until next time! Love and Peace <3"

"event","Why is it that people are SOOO ignorant?! Instead of asking questions, they assume, they listen to rumors, they are rude, and selfish... and it's just so aggravating. I have noticed that since I've decided to study, and as I tell people about it, or they ask about why I'm reading a WatchTower or an Awake, they seem to turn their backs to me, afraid to ask what it's about, or any questions at all. I'm all of a sudden not so sweet or fun in their eyes, I'm all of a sudden this FREAK. It's like what the HELL?! There are some people in my life that are acting just crazy all of a sudden, and it is really starting to bother me. It hurts, and it also causes my blood to boil as a result. 

I've realized lately who my TRUE friends are, those who don't judge, just accept it as a part of me and who I am. Those who may not necessarily agree with me but don't treat me like I'm all of a sudden not worthy of their friendship and love. I'm not trying to impose my beliefs on anyone, I'm not trying to preach, I'm just learning...

Satan just has an AMAZING way of trying to deter people's paths to Jehovah, and I am fighting strong to not allow it to happen... I know I'm not in this alone."

"event","My weekend was GREAT! It's been awhile since I've been able to say that, but I'm moving on... Friday night I was out til 5:30 am! AHH! Never done THAT before. It was fun though. I went with my best friend Melanie to this house party or whatever. I wasn't too keen on the fact that they were smokin weed, not to mention it stinks HORRIBLY and i was paranoid of it stickin to my hair and clothes, and my dad never lettin my go out again! He'll put my butt on lockdown with a QUICKNESS! (even though I'm 20) lol... I drank a little bit, but limited myself so that my last episode of pukin my brains out wouldn't reoccur. My body doesn't consume alcohol too well, plus it's bad to overdo it, so I have to figure out how much my body can take without getting plastered drunk. (I'm a new drinker, can't you tell! lol) 

On Saturday I went SHOPPING!!!! I dragged Mel and my other best friend Jayme along. They were my personal assistents, running back and forth in Lane Bryant getting me different colors, and sizes, puttin back stuff that didn't fit or I didn't like how it looked. We were ALL exhausted! I LOVE them! I bought some clothes for the kingdom hall FINALLY! Then we went to Kelly's house (my cousin) for a little family gathering. My friends LOVE my family (it's so hard NOT to), and we just all sat around the kitchen table (all 10-11 of us scrunched together) just telling stories and dyin of laughter all night long. It was a blast, and that sure does beat stayin home thinking of Oscar all night being depressed! Not many people can say that they hang out with their parents on the weekends, and it's such a blessing that I can. I thank Jehovah for that everyday. 

On Sunday I rolled out of bed, (Lord knows i was so tired) but I HAD to make it to the meeting, I was determined! I haven't been in like 2 years, and seeing all the brothers and sisters again was really nice. They were so inviting and happy that I'm still interested in the truth. I'm glad I went, and didn't want it to be over. lol... I wanted to be like, ""umm excuse me brother can you continue your talk for about another hour... that was interesting!"" It was about forgivness and how we should never hold grudges or ever be resentful. I had NO idea that it was THAT bad to hold a grudge, that Jehovah detests it SO much. I'm not one that really holds grudges, but I had done it for about 6 years or so against my mother, and recently talked it over with her and let it go. It was like lifting 500 pounds of bricks off of my back, and now i know WHY! It's like everyday you hold a grudge, or you aren't forgiving of something, Jehovah is up there adding the weight, in hopes you will have it in your heart to let it go. I'm amazed at the things that are in the Bible... it's seriously a guide to how we should live our lives, and it's a shame so many people ignore it. 

I've started my diet today! I'm not too excited about it, but I need to stay focused cause my mom is getting married in April and i have TONS of family coming down. All I need is for them to tell me how much weight I've gained! Lol Puerto Ricans have no shame and don't know how to keep their comments to themselves! So yea... I must start workin out too! Booo to that! But it HAS to be done!

Back to work today...class was cancelled, wish i'd have known so i could have taken a NAP! I just realized how long this was! woo sorry... Until next time...Love and Peace..."

I have felt so guilty ALL day, like Jehovah was up there shakin' his head at me in such disgust and disappointment. My stepmother told me not to worry about it, that it's a slow progress to let go of the holidays and stuff. It just makes it more difficult because my mom is like a holiday FREAK. She's so into it. I already told her for Christmas I'm not making a big deal about it, so not to plan on gifts and what not. She says she respects my decisions, but I know it still bothers her. 

Oscar called me earlier. I haven't talked to him for a while. My heart was in my stomach. I've been doing so good, not crying, and trying not to allow him to consume my mind all day. But he just messed up my flow! Lol... I talked to him for like 10 min. He told me he quit smoking like a week and a half ago. I was like WHAT!?!?! I begged him the ENTIRE time we were together to quit, and he always had the same response, ""The day you marry me, is the day I will quit."" *sigh* I miss him. SO much.

I know I know, that's why I'm gonna be a teacher! But Melanie (my best friend, my sister, my LOVE) made me promise not to be one of those teachers that wear Apple-printed skirts, with pencil and crayon-printed Vests, my hair in a bun, and Walmart flat shoes that are GOLD. LOL! I died! I SWORE on my Life i'd never do that. lol... I'll be umm... fashionable and fun. :)

I'm still stumped as to what to do my paper on for english comp. I was talkin to my professor and asked how open minded he was, since he said we can write a persuasive paper on ANYTHING. I was thinking of doing the Origin of Christmas, with a persuasive undertone that it is a pagen holiday and should not be celebrated. He was really interested in that. BUT I'm just worried about my time and the fact that it'll take a good amount of research, and I don't have that much time to do it. SOOO any other suggestions? Or should I stick to that? Hmmm... decisions, decisions..."

Due to the popularity of the Survivor shows, Texas is planning to do one  entitled, ""Survivor-Texas Style.""

The contestants will all start in Dallas, then drive to Waco, Austin, San Antonio, over to Houston and down to Brownsville. They will then proceed up to Del Rio, El Paso, Midland, Odessa, Lubbock and Amarillo.  From there hey will go on to Abilene, Fort Worth and finally back to Dallas.

Each will be driving a pink Volvo with bumper stickers that read:

""I'm gay, I love the Dixie Chicks, Boycott Beef, I voted for Al Gore, George Strait Sucks, Kerry in '04, Hillary in 2008, and I'm here to confiscate your guns.""

The first one who makes it back to Dallas alive, wins.

"event","Man it's been a LONG, LONG time since I've updated this journal! MONTHS! I get emotional looking back on all of that stuff, only because Oscar and I are no longer together. So much has happened, and it all just seemed like a giant snowball that was rolling downhill, getting bigger and bigger everyday, until  it finally fell off a cliff and exploded. I broke up with him on Friday Oct. 29th, a day I'll always remember to have changed my life as I know it. Since he came back from his month long job in California things just started from there. He quit because the company was not paying him, and when the finally did, none of the checks had money in the bank to cover them. I would have quit if it were me too! However, this caused Oscar to become depressed. He slipped into a huge depression and didn't want to look for work, or think about his future what-so-ever. In September things started getting worse between us, we started to argue over the STUPIDEST things, and i HATE confrontation, but at the same time I wasn't about to have him take advantage and step all over me. I finally got him to agree to go to school, but he wanted ME to look into the different programs and just hand everything to him on a silver plate. I was tired of mothering him. 
        Then he got diagnosed with having Bipolar disorder, which causes you to have manic highs, and deep depressions. He was in and out of these moods that would change in a split second. One minute he's fine, laughing and having a good time, and then I'd say or do something and he'd just explode in this rage that I could never understand. He never once laid his hands on me, but it was becoming emotionally abusive. I was emotionally DRAINED, as if the LIFE was sucked out of me. And for ME... that's ALOT cause I'm so happy-go-lucky, always laughing, making jokes, and having a good time in whatever I did, but the last two months of our relationship I had changed. I was always crying and we were arguing alot. My father and stepmom told me that if I didn't end things with him, then they'd do it for me!! I knew it had to be bad if other people were taking notice to my unhappiness, i could no longer hide it. Then I also found out from my stepmom's cousin, Kelly, that my dad was depressed over seeing me that way. My dad is my world, and to know he was putting so much mind to it, killed me. I couldn't go on knowing it was hurting my daddy to do so. So I tried to end things, and he'd cry, and I'd cry, and it'd be a big mess. He'd BEG not to do this to him, that I was all he had... and I felt so guilty, so sad for him. I just couldn't continue at that point and time, and so finally I grew strong and ended it. I cried my eyes out, it was so painful.
       I saw him several times after, at karate where I take my brother and two cousins (they were in the class where he was attended). It was so hard to be around him, not being able to grab and hug and kiss him, and I could see how hurt he was. I have never felt so torn and confused in my life.
     I am so depressed, and it's all new to me. I cannot stop my tears, they seem neverending. I cry myself to sleep everynight, and sometimes throughout the day. Everything is a reminder, everything triggers a memory, everything makes me think of him. My father has told me that I am not to speak to him anymore, and that has ripped me apart more then anything. I don't know if i want to let him go yet, its SO HARD. He has so many great qualities despite our nasty ending, and I don't know if it's for the better to end things forever, or better to take a break and let him get his life together as I regain my strength and get mine together. It's like i'm at a fork in the road of my life and I'm undecided which route to take. I'm so confused, and in such pain.  I walk around everyday with sucha heavy heart, and just wanting to lay in my bed and never leave.
      I pray that things will get better soon, I know I will climb over this HILL in the road, it's the process that's so damn tough. But I'm trying, and I'm surviving...."

He is so much a BIG part of my life and I seriously think I'd go crazy without him in it. He is getting frustrated being over there. I can just tell by the tone of his voice. He is so moody today too, of all days when I just want to talk, he isn't in the mood. BLAH......"

"event","Wow. It's been FOREVER since I've updated. I have been so busy with work and school over the past 3 and a half weeks or so. I am going to school in the mornings and then working at night, so it's been tough and long days. I LOVE my government class though. We go on field trips all the time and my professors are amazing. They are both SO involved in politics on all levels, so it's a great learning experience. One of them has worked in the white house for 6 years under Bush  #1 and Clinton as their advisor something... lol i don't know the technical name it was important though! and he was also city councilman here in san antonio for a couple years, the other one has worked in the state capitol, ran for state rep, worked for the governor... so they know EVERYONE! Everywhere we go important people talk to highly of them and refer to them by first name, like their buddies. We've been to the courthouses, federal, district, saw some criminal cases, a divorce case. Met the judges, saw a man get sentenced to 9 year in prison...We've also been to city council meeting, which wasn't too fun, but we met the mayor, and some council people! We went to the state capital, Austin, which even though is an hour away from me I'd never been. We had a mock debate on the House floor (house of rep's), which is HARD to do if you don't have CONNECTIONS. It's just so neat. I've learned SO much! And I swear, everyone in my class now wants to be a lawyer! It's the perfect class for me especially with my ADD and all! lol. Anyway.

Oscar has been gone for 3 WEEKS! and won't be gettin back for probably another week and a half. Which MEANS...... he won't be there for our ONE YEAR anniversary! *cries* It sucks. He is in california with his job working on some crap out there. I hate it and I can't wait for him to come home. I cry every single day! I try not to, and I know it makes it harder on him, so i try to hold it in, but man I just bust out crying cause I miss him so much. I just want to hug and kiss him so bad. 
:( The days are coming closer so I am excited. And I can't believe our anniversary is coming up already. We've been through a great year, had some rough patches, but hey, who doesn't. I think this trip with him being gone is gonna make us stronger. Plus maybe it is a blessing from Jehovah that I needed to concentrate on school...*sigh* I just pray he gets home safe and soon.

Nothing much has happened...just the same ol' stuff, only a different day. Take care I'm outsssssss..."

It's government, yea i know boring subject, but I have the 2 coolest professors! It's a 5 hour class, cause they combined Federal Government with State Government, but it's neat cause we go on all kinds of field trips, so the time flies by. We are going to go see a murder trial next week! Wooo hope it's something interesting, not just some stupid lady who ran over her husband, and you KNOW she's guilty. One of my professors worked for the white house for 4 years, as a consultant to President Bush (daddy Bush), and the other one was on City Council, and worked with George W. Bush when he was governor. I liked that they were so involved, then just memorizing stuff out of a book and reciting it all, making us fall asleep. After school I've been going to work, and i HATE working at night, but I only have 5 more weeks, thank god. 

Oscar left for California this morning! *cries* He SAYS it's for 10 days, but knowing his jerk ass boss, he'll be gone for 14-21 days. All i KNOW is he BETTER be back for our 1 year anniversary on July 4th!!! YAY! it's been a LONG year. LOL... VERY LONG! :-p I went to see him last night, cause he insisted. I told him that I would be tired, and he didn't care. So what'd I do? Fall asleep on him, snoring up a storm I'm sure, so much for spending time! lol. 

We went to Canyon Lake on Monday, and had a BLAST. There were about 50 people that went with us... the more the marrier. I got sunburned! along with everyone else, so i don't feel so bad. It was 104 degrees outside, and sunblock just didn't work when you have that kind of heat. Everyone we went with were all witnesses, just encouraging me to keep studying. I'm TRYING! It's so hard to balance with school and work. I leave at 7:30 in the morning, and get home at 9:30, sometimes 10:30 at night. I have no time, and I hate that. I need to figure out a time when I can just focus on studying, but it's also hard trying to fit into my stepmom's busy schedule. :( I hope Jehovah forgive's me. I feel horrible. 

Angelica got fired from her job. I felt SOOOOOO bad for her. I mean just terrible. Almost like it was ME who got fired. She LOVED her job more then anyone I KNOW. She violated some safety rule on the roller coaster, and even though it was a mistake, they have a zero tolerance policy, though she never did anything bad in the 2 years she had been at the amusement park. She cried her eyes out. OH my baby! She's gonna find something else fast, any employer would be STUPID not to hire her. She's the hardest worker I know, I admire that so much about her. She said Best Buy already called her back for an interview, and some restaurant is wanting her, they are just waiting for the space. I double cross my fingers for her. I hate seeing her bum around the house. 

Well I gotta take a shower, and go spend my check! WOOO! Money in my pocket! Too bad most of it is for bills. :( Oh well! I can spare some cash on some clothes or some shoes. :) I'm outties...Love always."

Oscar is on his way, I can't wait to just hug and kiss him, I miss him so much. It's been a week since we last saw each other. Tomorrow we are spending the WHOLE day together, since he's going to california for 2 weeks, we are trying to spend as much time together as possible. I'm gonna' miss him, just KNOWING he's not close. He's such a hard worker, i admire that about him. Anyway...

"event","Yay Fantasia WON! Wooo... I knew she would. Diana is still going to be great career wise, and just as famous. The show just opens doors for so many people. But OMG, on the radio this morning, they were talking about how people are trippen over the fact that Fantasia is 19 yo with a baby. Ummm SO?! it IS a reality show, and the reality is thousands of teenage girls have babies. Though I don't agree with it, at least she's using her talent to try and better herself for her and her baby's future. She's not sittin at home in the ghetto having kid after kid, collecting government checks... or struggling through college with 3 jobs. I seriously wish her the best. 

I'm finally OFF for 4 days!!!!!!!! *booty dances around the living room* YAY! I'm so happy. I have been working alot. My sis' graduates on Saturday, (blah graduations are boring! to sit through 800 names...omg I'm bored thinking about it). Then on Sunday we are going to the lake with like 60 people! My stepmom's  brothers know every Witness in TEXAS it seems like, lol. and every memorial day they come down to San Antonio and we have a weekend of fun. I love it.

"event","WOW it's been a while since I've updated this thing. I just haven't been on... 

Well I finally presented my proposal to all the managers at work. I was SO super nervous, but then I talked to my mommy and of couse she made me calm down. She told me, ""tina you have nothing to worry about, you've practiced, you know what you are talking about, and you are prepared, you'll knock them off their feet!"" SO then I was so excited to just get in there and take their breath away! Which I did! After I was done, they just were like ""wow, that was great! do you have previous public speaking experience?"" ""umm no sir, I just came prepared."" HAHA (i LIED, i took public speaking for 2 years in high school and would have competed if i hadn't switched high schools, SUCKAS!!) So yea, They LOVED my idea, and are seriously gonna take it to corporate offices-The BIG dogs! YAY!!! *booty dances* SCORE! Go christina! Go Christina! Wit-cha' bad self! WOOO... OH oh! sorry got excited there. 

Work today was stressful as always. It's comin up to the end of the month, so I have to drive my sales and freakin go CRAZY sellin to people, just gettin straight crazy on them.. ""What do you MEAN you don't want to get your fridge and washer covered mr. lkdsjafldsjk?!"" GRRR (lol some last names are SO like that) ""What if it were to break down tomorrow and you had no coverage?!""  Sometimes I want to scream at the stupidity of people's responses. I think yall would DIE of laughter at some of the things people across america say. It's INSANE. *sigh* I think I'm ready for another job. 

Oscar pissed me off again on Sunday, I think he's seriously just mastering that SKILL! cause lemme tell ya it's not easy to piss me off, but he can do it so well sometimes. Things are ok now, considering that i hardly talk to him. His job is number one and that just irritates the living CRAP out of me cause he works like 65 hours a WEEK! but if IIIIIIIII (bold, underlined AND italicized!! lol) wanted to do that when he wasn't working, he'd be throwing shit fits at the fact that we never spent time together. I just keep my mouth shut though cause I just thank the LORD he's working and not bummin around that dang house twiddlin' his thumbs and watching People's Court and All my Children. He's going to California for 2 weeks, and is just so excited. ME?! pssh I'm only mad cause they take advantage of him SO bad, and he just doesn't care and thinks I'm over-reacting! Umm no, they treat him like he's some immigrant (no offense to anyone please) who is working his tail off to only afford to pay something like the electricity bill. They need to pay him more, especially if they are gonna be sending him all across the country. I hate seeing my baby be taking advantage of like that. It's just become an ongoing arguement and I'm givin up. If he likes that job so much to stay and get paid pennies then.. *sigh* whatever. I'm tired of thinking about it. 

I start school NEXT WEEEEEEEK! YAY! I haven't been in school since last spring semester. I miss it! And I know one week into the summer semester, I'm gonna be like crying ""I don't WANNA go to schooL! I don't WANNA do homework! GRRR"" But for right now it's just excitement. What sucks the most though is that I have to work at nights for 6 weeks! omg, I hate that! But hey for every advantage their's a disadvantage. 

I rehighlighted my hair this past friday. AWWW I like it. I was trying to leave it grow back to my natural dark brown, but it was taking too long and i was getting bored with it. It cost me $100!!!!! i about had a heart attack, but hey if i would have done it myself they would NOT have been highlights but patches! lol. Anyway... I haven't had a day off since LAST sunday, and I think I'm going a bit crazy, I'm SOOOOOOOOO looking forward to my four day weekend starting this friday. Jehovah is great lemme tell ya! lol.. Well my fingers are getting clumsy from all the typin, so I'm outties. -Christina"

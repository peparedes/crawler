"event","I am wrestling with such a case of burn out. I'm cranky at work, cranky with students, cranky about dancing and would really prefer not to have to talk to anyone. It has a lot to do with my schedule being so packed. I work 8-5, M-F. Teach a class W-Th 30 miles away, have a private student on Tuesdays and dance F-Sat. nights. Right now the only time I have to myself is Sunday and Monday night and I still have people who want those. Needless to say my house looks like it's being used by homeless people. I need a house-boy. I've also been around WAY too many women lately. It's getting to me. They've been squeally, gushing, cry and get excited at the drop of a hat messes. If you could only know what that feels like to me. It's like being surrounded by bees that are all buzzing at their loudest and all trying to be heard. I need to around men more. Or run away to an island somewhere."

"event","since I entered anything. Let's see....what's been happening......did I write about New Year's Eve? Hmm.....anyway, it went well. I like dancing at big Arabic parties. It makes me feel like I'm at the Pyramids again. I've decided I need to pop in there and chat with Amr for a bit. It wouldn't hurt me to skip a night once a month at the Hookah and dance somewhere else. I need to get myself in front of Arabic people more. 

This past Saturday I performed at the NBC5 Health Expo. 22 minutes of fast dancing to show off the cardio side of BD.I was pretty pooped at eh end of it but I think it went over well. I had a big audience and at the end I was mobbed for business cards. If enough people show interest I may start a BD fitness class.

I am going to participate in a fundraiser for tsunami relief next month. It's an all day event on Feb. 27 that is going to feature free dance workshops and a show that evening. I've volunteered to teach a workshop and dance. It should be a lot of fun. If anyone is interested in going you can contact Jessica Dawn at jessica.dawn@gmail.com for more info. 

My new sword came in yesterday. Oh, Sh-t is it gorgeous. It's a real turkish scimitar that happens to be center balanced. It's huge and heavy and impressive. I can't wait to use it this weekend. I'll murder someone if I catch them trying to steal it. No more stealing my stuff. Everything is locked up from now on and you'll have to get out with the whole heavy ass suitcase to take anything.

Tisch is supposed to dance in the Kismet hafla this Sat. We'll see if she makes it. She's given herself wiggle room to get out but I think she'll do it because Leslie is flying in from NM to be here. She's going to get the eyebrow raise if she backs out. I'm going to her house before hand so we can caravan there. 

Oh, these people I work with. They are nice but man, are they into their grandchildren. You can't walk down the hall without someone showing you their newest picture. Then they stand there and have dueling picture wars trying to prove that their grandchild is the cutest and smartest. Makes my head hurt.

MySpace.com kicks-ass. I've run into a lot of people I know and some pretty cool bands so I can keep up with what is going on in Dallas since I don't get out much. Check it out."

"event","I guess I could start with last weekend and make my way forward. 

<b>Saturday:</b> Danced at the Deep Ellum Velvet Hookah. Around 1:30 or so I as stopped by this guy who liked my make-up and said it looked very Egyptian. I said thanks and he asked me what I did and I told him I was the belly dancer. He asked if I had ever belly danced before...in another life...I said I didn't think so (wha?) and he then proceeded to tell me that he was asking because in  one of his former lives, not the last one but one two lives ago, he had been a Pharaoh. I said ""Wow, how do you know that"" and immediately turned my ears off and listened around me for anything going on that I could excuse myself to.  Now, I do believe in past lives, I just don't believe that everyone was a king, queen, conquerer, Napoleon's right hand man etc. Those are just people who are looking for a way to make themselves seem special and exciting. Fortunately, Gayle had started dancing and I had to go. The people I meet...

<b>Sunday:</b> Decided I wanted to put up Christmas lights on the house. Nothing big, just some little colored lights. Went to the store and got some and put them around the front of the house. Nothing dramatic there. I was going to plug them in through the garage but had forgotten that the previous owners had hardly updated anything and the garage did not have a three pronged outlet. Normally I would just go get an extension cord but that didn't really help because that are two things already using the outlet and one of them is some kind of little transformer box that has a wire going up to the attic. It's been there since I moved in and I have no idea what it is for and am not about to unplug it because something might blow up. So I decide to change outlet to a three prong. I had a bout four in a drawer. I turned off the electricity and pulled out the old outlet. The wires connected to it were not the little thin wires that are on everything else. They were these thick copper wires that couldn't be bent by hand. I thought ""Hmmm...maybe I won't change it"" Went to put it back and one of the little things holding the wire in broke. Now I <i>have</i> to change it. The garage door uses the outlet. Out come the needle nose pliers and I have to bend the wires to go around the little screws. It took a lot of manhandling because the wires were so thick that when I tightened the screws down they would slip out. I finally get that done and then the wires didn't want to bend to go back in the receptacle box. More manhandling. So what was a simple little job turned into a 2 1/2 hour thing. I got it done but I know why people don't like putting up lights. 

<b>Monday:</b> I've had this little knot above my upper lip for a while. It had started out as a regular pimple but didn't go away and was this little hard knot that didn't hurt. It was just annoying. I was going to have it removed when the insurance started at my new company. Well, Monday it was sore and started to swell. By  8 pm that night my lip was twice it's normal size and I decided I was  going to the doctor. By 2 am the left side of my face was swollen and by 4 am I was at the ER. I looked like something from a freak show and the swelling was getting worse. The little knot had ruptured and IU had a pretty good infection going. The hooked me up to an IV to give me antibiotics and that was fun in itself. My veins, which are very nice and stand out, somehow managed to disappear when the needle went in. It took them four tries to get blood and an IV in me. The first girl gave up and called in someone else. He was able to get a small needle in my left forearm but couldn't get any blood, so he put the IV there and got blood from the bend in my elbow. Both my forearms have nice bruises along them. So not only did I look like a freak show I looked like a freak show on heroine. After all of that they sent me home with some antibiotics. That was yesterday. Today the swelling is about half gone. I'm going to give it until tomorrow before I go back to work. The upshot is, the knot is gone. :-)

This has been a really bad three days for Tisch's family. She went to the ER Sunday because of intense abdominal pain and found out she had a fibroid tumor in the wall of her uterus. She wants to have kids so there is no getting it out. The only way to get it out is a hysterectomy, so she is going to have to live with the pain when ever it flares up until she has kids. As if that weren't bad enough, her grandmother died Monday afternoon in her sleep. T is handling it pretty well. She said her nana was ready to not be here anymore. She had stopped eating about a week ago and T's mom would not let them put a tube in her. She wanted her to be able to pass with dignity. D comes home from Germany this Saturday and they are going to hold the funeral on Sunday so he can be there. I hate that he has to come home like this, even though it will be great to see him. He hasn't been home in a year."

Something about being in front of a computer all day and then going home and doing it again is not appealing. I wish I could work on my website from here. That would be perfect. 

Even though there isn't much going on at work I do like it. I went for a nice long walk around the ballpark yesterday at lunch. I'm going to do that every day that I can. I didn't have those wonderful afternoon nap attacks afterwards. 

I discovered a few things in Dreamweaver last night and will try to use them on my site. Sometimes the instructions don't produce the desired result. I did find someone who has video of me dancing and want to get those on the site too. That will be, oh, at least three months of hair pulling and screaming. 

I'll be in Deep Ellum this weekend. Hope it's a good one. It can be kind of boring because I don't know anyone down there although on of the girls said she was going to come by and bring a friend who's never been. That will be nice."

I like my new job. I always think it is amusing that some of the people who work at a place will always try to make the company or position seem horrible. You always get the "" Just wait..."" speech. I've yet to run into a job that I thought was horrible. It's the people with negative attitudes that make it that way. Well, OK. Except for the one time when I was laid off and I took a part time job at a petting zoo. I really wanted to work with the animals and loved that part. I got paired with the Llamas because they liked me and didn't try to bite me. It was the hordes of screaming 3rd and 4th graders I couldn't take. I didn't last long.  

Threw some copy and pics on the home page of my web site. I'll try to finish it this weekend. I'm checking with the organizers of the Kismet haflas to see if they have any digital video footage of me. That will be another two months of teeth gnashing to get those formatted and on the site. :-I"

I think I'm going to like this new company. One of my sales reps has moved to the new place too and I'll get to work with her so it won't really be like starting from scratch. 

I got my web site up. www.tahiyahassan.net It's really basic right now, but as I learn more I'll add interactive features. Hmm...went to the lake house for Thanksgiving with Laura and Matt. Ate too much and didn't get enough sleep. Watched a lot of Invader Zim. Love that show. The weather was really nice though. I like sitting on the dock by the lake. It's so peaceful. 

The hookah now has us rotating every two weeks. I dance in Addison for two weeks and then Deep Ellum. I like the DE spot I just don't like paying to park. And having to get to the club at 7 so I can get close parking. I hate having to hike to my car at the end of the night with all of my stuff.

"event","Woo...busy weekend. I took last thursday and Friday off work thinking I would get some rest and a few things done around the house. Silly me, I know I ought not think. I did get a lot of sleep Wednesday night but it went downhill from there. Friday night was the Velvet Hookah's first birthday party so I was up there at 5 pm to help get Aaron ready. He looked so good. I covered his upper body and face in a fine gold powder and did Egyptian eyeliner on him. We had a very busy night, almost too busy. There was a silk dancer that was really good and Leah came in to do fire and played with me. She let me use these little hand lamps to dance. They are small little oil lamps encased in metal. You can turn them upside down and they do not go out and oil doesn't leak. I liked them. I'm going to have to get a set. 

Saturday was Tisch (live journal id: bellymocha) and Clint's engagement party. It was at a gorgeous location on a lake in Garland. You could see the whole lake from the pavilion. The wether was perfect and worked out so that there was a breeze the whole time and we weren't sweaty. Of course I overdressed. I knew it was to be casual but I thought if I wore jeans I would be the only one. Silly me again. I was the only one not casual. Luckily Laura had a pair of flip flops in her car so I didn't have to be in heels. I did really well and didn't cry very much at all. I only had a couple of leaks and that was because Laura started up and that got me going. Leslie came in from New Mexico and it was good to see her. I'm glad Tisch chose her to be a matron of honor. 

After the party I went to the Hookah to work and had a large party of Goreans come in. I didn't mind at all. I got to experience some wonderful hair pulling. I just love that. Woooo.......... I was very relaxed and could have gone to sleep right there. And today I am doing some yard work because I don't get to be outside much and it's really good for my mood to get outside. I slow down more and don't rush about so much. In fact I think I'll take Sedona for a walk........"

This Friday is the Velvet Hookah in Addison's first birthday. We're having some kind of big hoo-ha party. Everyone is going to be Egyptian-y. The guys are supposed to be shirtless and the girls are in harem/bd outfits. I'm supposed to have the three of the girls for the night to be minions. :-D I do minions well. I have to go in on Wed. night this week to hammer out the details. This should get interesting. The party starts at 7 so drop by if you can.

Tisch and Clint's engagement ceremony is this Saturday. I'm going to be a mess. Snotting everywhere, and then I have to go to work. I don't think they make enough makeup to cover red noses and blood shot eyes. Oh, well.  At least it's dark in the hookah."

Things have been zipping along lately with dancing. I'm teaching two classes a week, one semi-private, which I like a lot, have a party this weekend as well as my regular gig and I think I'm going to do a bit more restaurant dancing.

<P>Nibbling on peanuts for a another reason.

So I did some research and found that I need to eat more at night than I do. :-p Not really hip on that. I never feel like it. Also found out that I probably do this a lot during the week while sleeping. That's why I can go to bed and sleep 8 hours and feel exhausted when I wake up. Now for the funny part. We have a very good tarot reader at the hookah on Friday, Robin. She read for me about three weeks ago and at that time she told me that she saw me getting sick either from lack of nutrition or sleep. I would have voted for sleep but nutrition won. </P>

I have a poi lesson tomorrow and haven't practiced very much so I expect to have some new bruises to show. Ever been smacked in the eye with a chain? Ain't nice, but I'm liking learning. It's a new skill that I think will be a lot of fun. As you know if you have read bellymocha's journal she and her man are getting engaged. They say they are going to have a handsal and get married a year and a day after that, but they won't make it. They will probably end up combining the Handsal ceremony into their wedding and just do it at once. I'm very happy for them. Both of them are perfectly themselves with each other and that is how is should be.

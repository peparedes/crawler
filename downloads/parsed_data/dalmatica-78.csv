"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: small;"">I'm glad to have made it past the darkness...there was a point, where, I did not know if I could for another day. One day, I just stopped berating myself,second guessing. Now, I focus on rebuilding, it won't be the same. Never is. It will be <em>better.</em> Things happened for a reason, connections severed, hearts broken, it had to be ground zero in my life in order for me to rebuild. I got sick of repairing a collapsing building. Now, is the time for healing. Bye, bye regret. See you later, scared and timid person I once was. <br /><br />Still a lot of work needed on the outside, the pain and trials show there, that's being improved. but inside, is coming along fabulously. It is a struggle, but no one ever said life was easy. I find things fall into place as I work on other areas. I'm more of a logical person now, more quiet, patient, keeping my anger in check.&nbsp; Some of you know that  I have spent the better part of the last three months alone, by choice.( minus my trip to Quebec) I spoke few words, and have not seen anyone I am friends with since March 3rd, again by choice. Because my mind was in a bad place. I needed this time to clear my mind, to discover me, to hurt, and to heal. Being alone, can be a great tool. So much I took for granted...<br /><br /><br /> A few days ago, I talked with someone I hadn't spoken with since last May. They said I literally acted like a completely different person. I didn't have to ask. I knew what they meant, and it didn't bother me. It wasn't a pretty picture. A spoiled rotten, selfish person who for some reason, could not see past their own misfortunes. The whole world weeps. Everyone hurts. We <em>all </em>lose. It's inevitable,and a gamble. <br /><br />This period in my life, feels like the calm. The breaking point, the eye of the storm if you will. Surrounded by chaos, dark threatening clouds, with the sun momentarily shining upon me. Putting aside my pride, admitting the need for help, reaching for my lost family. Funny how it took 31 years to figure out these things. I am thankful for having those trials one after the other that brought me to my knees. Humbled. Don't get me wrong, I get pissed still about things, but the difference is now I <em>think. </em>Don't ask me to choice sides, or hate needlessly. Because I won't, no matter how the case is represented. Because It isn't my place. I've made my choice, and made my peace with above. <br /><br /> I'm standing true to my words, my actions. I strive to be a better individual, I am joyous when my friends are blessed. That blessing will come to me someday, my epic soulmate will appear on the horizon...<br /><br />Change will always come, inevitable as the tide. Sometimes bad things happen, people fade, connections come unglued, because it's<em> time</em>. Not because of anything sinister, when one forces something to stay the same it goes all sorts of wrong. Relationships,Friendships,Fortune....if you love something or someone,<em> let it go.</em> If it was meant to be, they will come back. When we lose, it hurts. Denial furthers that hurt. Acceptance, floats the sinking ship. I'm happy to say, I am a work in progress. And my quilt is beautiful, as is yours. Live, people. <em>Fearlessly. </em><br /></span>"

"event","I've also decided that if I'm not better on my own significantly then now. I haven't slept. My body is refusing it. It has to be dangerous at this point. I woke up on Wed 10pm. It is now Friday 3:14am...I'm being punished for stupid decisions. I snapped under high stress and let this monster control my every movement, almost my every thought. I'm seeing my doctor on Tueday, completely clean. I've been clean since Monday. And I will tell you, it's been hell. I'm never doing this again. Letting this spin out of control. But the pain inside is what I'm most worried about. Gary took advantage of me when I was intoxicated, twisted me to do his dirty work, so he appeared innocent,the parania set in and he'd look straight faced and say calmly I don't know what your talking about. Even now, he is poking at me, saying little things to piss me off, saying I need help I'm an addict, etc. Yea, NO&nbsp;SHIT"

a. I don't even feel it.
b. I stuck another contact in so it would stick to it as a suggestion, it went in and nothing.
c. I have no idea what to fucking do. The optometrist is telling me to go to the er, but mind you this is wal fart. I don't want syringes and forceps on my F*ing eyeball!! >:(
d. Of course this had to happen to me, and of course no one can even see the stupid thing on my lid, it's like NOWHERE!!
e. Yeah, I'm losing sleep over this, I slept all of 5am to 9amish.

Also, the optometrist who fitted my contacts hauled ass and moved and to Freakin' Arizona right after!! GRRR. So I have this guy Corey telling me he thinks it fell out one of the times I was messing with it...it's not there so where ever it is, no one can see it."

Subject: Orange County Fire Victims...
Body: 	I'm posting this, hoping it will be passed on.

Hey everyone! Want to do something nice for someone who has lost everything? If so read on.

People usually assume that when a charity asks for a donation it means money. Well obviously not everyone has money to just donate. But there are other ways to make a difference in someone's life who is in great need. Rather than throwing away out of style clothes, clothing that does not fit,shoes too small, do *this*. Put a smile on someone's face.

You can send clothing, shoes, accessories and more too. They are accepting plus size and regular size. They are SO grateful that we are doing this, as they told me they have a much higher need for plus size clothing. If shipping charge is an issue try to get your work, or church to do participate!!

Here is their address:

Working Wardrobes
Attn: Donations
11614 Martens River Circle
Fountain Valley, CA 92708

Just put a little note in the package saying that you are donating for the fire victims.

Another way you can help is by believe it or not using windows live messenger. Yes this is true, so get more info at
http://im.live.com/Messenger/IM/Home/
or at http://american.redcross.org/site/PageServer?pagename=imready_learn

these are such simple free ways to help, so please do. Even re posting this will help some!!

You are an outgoing person who's a bit of a showoff. It's likely that you dress up for Halloween every year.

You definitely think of yourself as someone who has a dark side. And part of having that dark side means not showing it.

Your inner child is creative, patient, and whimsical.

You truly fear the dark side of humanity. You are a true misanthrope.

You're prone to be quite emotional and over dramatic. Deep down, you enjoy being scared out of your mind... even if you don't admit it.

You are a total overachiever and workaholic. You're the type of person who plans their elaborate Halloween costume weeks in advance.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatsyourhalloweenpersonalityquiz/"">What's Your Halloween Personality?</a></div>"

Brain Type Test	Brain Type Test

Brain Type Test - Free Results

Are You Left-Brained or Right-Brained?

Although one side of the brain is generally dominant over the other, we should strive to utilize both halves. A balanced brain makes a balanced person - combining sequential thinking with a holistic approach, or linear thinking with intuition, enables us to fully comprehend issues and solve problems. Left-brainers can dramatically improve their problem solving abilities by learning to ""follow their gut,"" while right-brainers can improve the execution of their creative efforts.

Realizing your dominant half is the first step in becoming balance-brained.
Your percentage score for the left brain is 52%.
Your percentage score for the right brain is 48%.

You are more left-brained than right-brained. Your left brain controls the right side of your body. In addition to being known as left-brained, you are also known as a critical thinker who uses logic and sense to collect information. You are able to retain this information through the use of numbers, words, and symbols. You usually only see parts of the ""whole"" picture, but this is what guides you step-by-step in a logical manner to your conclusion. Concise words, numerical and written formulas and technological systems are often forms of expression for you. Some occupations usually held by a left-brained person include a lab scientist, banker, judge, lawyer, mathematician, librarian, and skating judge.

Your left brain/right brain percentage was calculated by combining the individual scores of each half's sub-categories. They are as follows:

Left Brain

    * Linear
    * Sequential
    * Symbolic
    * Logical
    * Verbal
    * Reality-based 

Right Brain

    * Holistic
    * Random
    * Concrete
    * Intuitive
    * Nonverbal
    * Fantasy-oriented"

I'm getting better at the whole keeping record of banking type stuff. I'm going to be re arranging my living room soon, R's idea is a good one, I agree with him, and then I can bring the fish tank back in here where it belongs. Fishtanks don't go by tables.&nbsp; Next month for my b day, I am considering buying this beautiful black table, with one pedestal in the middle as opposed to stupid table legs. Table legs are just damn annoying. &gt;.&lt; And so aren't men on Eharmony. Freakin' creepins.&nbsp; I seriously love how a 40 yr old man will tell me I am too young to have a relationship with them, without even attempting to see where I may be on a personal level...the things I have gone through, most people do not go through this until they are in their 40's. Losing my son,my parent,grandparent, and practically getting divorced. but they wouldn't think twice bout bangin' someone twice their junior.&nbsp; Funny that. They do not even take the time to get to know where my mentality is. Yeah, I'm 28...but ask anyone who *knows* me. Surely they will say I act old for my age. But not in a bad way. This is good that I tried this, because I learned that this is not the way to meet the man of my dreams..I could see meeting him at an opera..or a Boston pops concert, yes...a thought. I will remain positive in this matter, for it will be a long time coming till I will be able to focus on such things..it's just lonely, and I want him here..now. <br /><br />Last night, I cut my Dahlias...had to. Frost. When I brought them in and put them in a vase, I found a.......surprise! Two cute little chubby fluffy bumblebees has wedged their way into the purple petals and sleeping looking oh so cold :(&nbsp; It didn't take long before they stirred and awoke. Buzzing around in my kitchen :P Ok, I was not about to kill them. If you know your science, you know that 70% has died from a mysterious bee virus. We NEED bees.Anyhow, I was so psyched, as a photographer, this was the perfect picture. I took a bunch of shots, and watched while they feed from the nectar in the flowers..amazing. Their little faces got all dusty with pollen..it was kinda cute.&nbsp; :D Pics will follow of course, as I love sharing my photos! <br /><br />There's some goals I absolutely *need* to stay on track with, those being as follows:<br /><br />1. Make an effort to get out and work out every day or night, doesn't matter which. It just needs to be. I'm getting more fond of running. I don't know what it is...but running is drawing me like a magnet. Last night, I did 22 laps around the tennis courts, and it felt GREAT.&nbsp; I've got the cross country skies, just need the boots to go with them. <br /><br />2. Get together my art business, really do it. Even if it's only a little bit here and there, something is better than nothing. Something will be something to work with one day..so even if it's buying frames and developing pictures every few weeks..I've got months to start for this. I've made friends with the people that run the market, and need TWO avenues for my stand next spring. And by spring, I should be also looking quite cute ^_^)<br /><br />3. Travel. I need to get my birth certificate from my country. (Canada) and also get a passport via Canada. I don't think I'd feel very safe traveling as an American. (no offence)&nbsp; So Canada, and Russia are on my list of places to go ...though I would really love a travel buddy.*hint, hint, nudge,nudge*<br /><br />Gods, Vladimir Putin is so damn sexy. First he goes shirtless revealing is impeccable hotness while fishing in Siberia...theeenn he goes to the meeting in Iran despite a death threat. Seriously...he's sexy. Strong, capable..oozing of masculinity. *faints*&nbsp; Not to mention he is Russian and well that right there does it for me ;)&nbsp; Course thanks to good ol' drunkinator bushmiester..our relations are FAR from great with RU.

I think I'm going to cancel my membership, I don't like having that much rejection, especially in one day. :(

These people are so damn close minded...it's beyond me how anyone can have luck on there, maybe they just think I'm ugly. That's what I'm thinking. God. I'm so damn ugly. Ok, maybe too plain looking, I don't know. If I were hot or something( you know a perfect 10) they would WANT to talk to me. I'm curious just how the hell is one supposed to find their ""match"" on a stupid site when they are so damn close minded?!?!?! Are ALL people like this in the world?! Grr. I'm pissed. And bummed out...Well, honestly I don't think that I'm going to find Him on a dumb site like that anyways..*sigh* I'll probably have to relocate to Eastern Europe. Not that that would be a bad thing mind you...maybe there I would not be considered ""fugly"" Whereas here, well..HA a joke. What physical attractiveness is. Seriously. In both men and women. Making themselves all nasty and scrawny, ick! Healthy and fit should be the image, I think. But hey, that's just me,and I'm an odd ball because I could give a shit less what a screwed up society thinks of me. :)

I haven't posted in a while..this week has been *really* tough emotionally. I'm still sticking with things though. SO many times I wanted to turn to food for comfort this week..and even though I gave in once, there was about 20 successes to match. I had two pieces of fried chicken, blah. After eating it, my mind was like what a minute...this doesn't feel as good as it used to. Like any other person making a lifestyle change, I remember the exact day I decided to really get serious about my health. A year ago, I was simply flirting with the idea of losing weight. Soo...it has been 7 1/2 weeks that I have remained faithful to my program..a few slip ups but I got back on track and didn't give up. And now my results are clearly paying off..check this out. I got my blood tests back from my doctor who nearly jumped she was so happy. 

10/10/07

LDL-144
HDL-48
Total Cholesterol-226 (I think this must be a typo because, those two add up to 191.4)
Triglycerides-174
Fasting Glucose-95

This is so amazing...health wise mainly. I am no longer pre diabetic, my hypertension as I said before is more manageable, my risk for heart disease has gone down from 5.4 to 4.8..for women it's supposed to be 4.4. I'm soclose! She thinks that just exercising and losing weight will get my numbers down to norm, since they have fallen so much since May this year. I think I may need my glasses re adjusted, they keep falling off my face now, and rubbing my poor nose raw. :-/ 

 On another note I'm almost there in completing my goal of 436.5 miles!! 50 miles left to go! (yeah, I got a little off track, I know, but I'm back :D deadline is October 20th. I've also incorporated running into my schedule every other day."

This is why her symbol is Venus, goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped. In fury and grief, she kept the Earth barren till her child was returned to her.</font></p>

"event","Before I went to the fair yesterday,&nbsp; I sat down and had three pieces of haddock..YUM! Yes it was breaded damn it, but it was reduced fat, and I nuked them. ....we got in for free again...........!!.........woo hoo!&nbsp; I went with my best friend's family (pretty much my adopted family) I was dressed cutise, my hair adorned with those pretty roses. I thought at first they were too big, but I received *a lot* of compliments on them! And check this out....I was flirted with by TWO handsome older men, heh heh. This is so cool, I hadn't expected to be flirted with so soon into my weight loss journey, but I'm happy :)&nbsp; I love going out with my family, it really relaxes me..it's a place were I can be me, and be hugged, laugh, and just be silly. It's a good thing to have different kinds of Sanctuary. After walking around in the rain, flirting it up with a handsome cop in his prime sporting wonderfully tight hunting pants, (you know me)&nbsp; we went to the old town store. It's a store that's been there since 1790 or something, original cash registers still there!!! I was a good girl, for I did not buy candy. I bought a huge pickle. (shush, you ;) yankee candle tarts,homemade soap( I'm starting to get really into that, less chemicals. I'm looking to buy organic shampoo and Conditioner too) Yes, I'm going all out :P&nbsp; The only thing that sucked about last night was I got lost for a bit, and my knee started REALLY fucking hurting about 8 or so..I was pissed wanted to brave it without drugs,wanted to have a good time not being all droned out.<br /> <br /> Anywho, my favourite part of the fair is the animals. Because a. It doesn't cost money. b. I like interacting with animals, and learning about livestock.&nbsp; Grr. Tomorrow is a holiday, so by the time I send my Netflix movies out on Tues, I probably won't get the other ones till freakin' Thursday. Grr. And the movies you can watch online are all pretty damn lame.&nbsp; Joanie and I have made plans to go horseback riding on my b day!<br /> <br />I know it's early yet, but I was thinking of making Yule baskets for Christmas. Natural soaps with preferred scents,maybe a candle or two, game meat, and cheese. It's old fashioned yes, but there's something wonderfully snug about putting actual effort into making something for someone. It means so much more than driving to the nearest wal*fart and picking up a cheap gift basket. :-/&nbsp; I can't do paintings. It just takes too much effort. My oils are pricey, and I still don't have an income for my work. I don't understand why...it's like everyone wants me to paint for free. That's kinda insulting as painting just doesn't come easy, I need to be inspired. I haven't painted a piece since June.&nbsp; =(&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone is interested in seeing my work it's on my myspace thingy.&nbsp; <br /> <br /><br />PS Welcome back, <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://kyle64.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://kyle64.livejournal.com/""><b>kyle64</b></a></div><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Hunting,Furs,Other Stuffs..."">I put this behind lj-cut out of respect for some LJ friends who are vegan/pro animal. I just want to be respectful of that, and give fair warning, anywho read on if your ok with hunting,furs. ext...<br /><br /> My adopted ""dad"" offered to take me hunting....!!...I'm ecstatic about that. I asked him how I can obtain a license, and he said they have courses at the fire dept. and other places. This will be SO awesome. I'm a firm believer in culling/hunting. It helps decrease disease in the wild,winter famine,and over population. It's always been done since the ancestors figured out how to. These are good skills to have, especially (God forbid) during circumstances where we would have to fend for ourselves. It's no good to be a stupid sitting duck. <br /> <br /> I'm also going to be taught how to skin a rabbit, (yeah, gross) but again, it's a valuable skill, with such soft fur. And if one is going to hunt game, they should be respectful of the animal by using everything possible.&nbsp; It's sort of an Indian thing, thanking the animal for it's sacrifice, by feeding and warming you or something. More on that another time.&nbsp; I'm hoping to get a deer, that would be good. It will take time though, lots of it. But hey that's like 350lbs of game meat, that I would love to share with friends who appreciate it.&nbsp; So <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://fetish666.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://fetish666.livejournal.com/""><b>fetish666</b></a></div>&nbsp;here's a pic&nbsp; I have of my first rabbit fur :P<br /> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Forever Locked"" actual moose taxidermied or however you spell<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were found like that in the woods and died that way locked. <br /> &nbsp; My Bunny Fur!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Quite a few of my family members helped pay for this!<br /> <img width=""372"" height=""288"" alt="""" src=""http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/dalmatica_78/012-3.jpg"" /><img width=""369"" height=""289"" alt="""" src=""http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/dalmatica_78/010.jpg"" /><br /> <br /> My best friend's dog Samantha, (we think she's due for pups,<br /> but it's hard telling....she does seem more tame though and is showing signs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Timber, the one that looks like Brandy.<br /> <img width=""376"" height=""381"" alt="""" src=""http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/dalmatica_78/003.jpg"" /><img width=""350"" height=""381"" alt="""" src=""http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/dalmatica_78/002.jpg"" /></div>"

You learn as it seems important to a specific situation, and might even develop a resentment of others who attempt to direct your learning down a specific channel. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica, sans-serif"">Your right-hemispheric dominance provides a structure that is only loosely organized and one which processes entire swatches of reality, overlooking details. You are emotional in your reactions and perceptual more than logical in your approach, although you can impose structure and a language base when necessary. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica, sans-serif"">Your auditory preference, on the other hand, implies that you process information sequentially and unidimensionally. This combination of right-brain and auditory modes creates conflict, as you want to process data more rapidly than your natural processes allow. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica, sans-serif"">Your tendency to be creative and free-flowing is accompanied by sufficient ability to organize and be logical, allowing you a reasonable degree of success in a number of different endeavors. You take in information methodically and systematically which can then be synthesized rapidly. In this manner, you manage to function consistently well, although certainly less efficiently than you desire. </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica, sans-serif"">You prefer the abstract and are a theoretician at heart while retaining the ability to be practical. You find the symbolism in a great deal of what you encounter and are something of a ""mystic."" </font></p><p> <font size=""2"" face=""Helvetica, sans-serif"">With regards to your lifestyle, you have the mentality which would be good as a philosopher, writer, journalist, or instructor, or possibly as a systems designer or social worker. Perhaps most important is your ability to ""listen to your inner voice"" as a mode of skipping over unnecessary steps to achieve your goals. </font></p></div>"

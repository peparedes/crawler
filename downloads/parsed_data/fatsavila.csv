"event","&nbsp;valentine, the malaysian dude who owns manila contemporary, decided that he'll take me on part time. apparently, he liked me the most out of everyone that he interviewed for the manager position. ok, i really have a knack for interviews. hehe. anyway so i'm gonna work as deputy manager for the art gallery fridays-sundays. goodbye weekends.<br /><br />and i've just realized...<br /><br />GOODBYE UAAP! OH MY GOD FINAL 4 PA NAMAN. :(<br /><br />oh well. sacrifices must be made for career advancement. this part time art gallery stint will be a sort of testing the waters thing - at the end of the year, i'll decide whether to stay with the senate, or get this full time.&nbsp;<br /><br />grabe. i never had and probably never will experience a bum's life. even before grad, i got an offer from the senate. now, that my contract with the senate is still a couple of months shy of terminating and renewing, i get this offer.&nbsp;<br /><br />i guess all these things happen for a reason. at least now i have something new to add to my resume which i'll send to the UK universities.<br /><br />or maybe i'm just a workaholic..like motherdear.<br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","UK. Finally applied to the Univ of Edinburgh. That's first on the list.&nbsp; I knew FedEx was pricey but I didnt know how expensive it actually was. P2k to send 2 sheets of paper!!! Jesus. Will have to adjust my essay for the other schools.&nbsp; Will apply in the next few weeks.&nbsp; 

Why do we go through things despite the certainty of failure? Edinburgh ranks 23rd in the world, requires a GPA of 3.3 and above, has an excellent program, and is located in a SUPERB location. Too good to be true...Asa pa diba. But i'm hoping...praying...begging God, destiny, and the universe that maybe they'll look past my grades. PLEASE. Is 2.85 a long way from 3.3? Yessir. Haaay. 

If Edinburgh rejects me, and so do the other schools, kebs. I'll apply to Ateneo next year. They have a new joint program with a business school in Paris and in Budapest. That's my back up. I really want to study and really want to do so in a reputable school abroad even if it's just a joint thing with a school here. 

Work. Work's been kinda toxic with our international conference just concluded and now budget season. Got an job offer to be a manager of an art gallery. They need one ASAP. Met the owner and told him I'm not available full time coz my contract at the senate ends december, but am available part time fri-sun (the gallery is open everyday except Mondays). Well lets see if he'll consider that arrangement. I'm hoping he'll ride on the idea coz I'd really welcome something new to do and an additional source of income.

Gym. I'm losing weight, albeit at a VERY slow pace. Lost only 4 pounds in a month and a week. Haha. But I've been able to put on a pair of pants that hitherto does not fit my anymore so yay haha. The reason I'm not losing more weight is coz I didn't and have no plans to alter my diet or lifestyle. So its still meat, meat, rice, beer, whisky, vodka. hehe."

"event","Chip left for Minnesota this morning.&nbsp; 

Twinks arrived at Emerald at around 1am to sleep over.&nbsp; We woke up at 3am, picked up Sison, and headed toward the Chipeco residence at Valle Verde 6.&nbsp; The sadness was apparent during the drive there.&nbsp; Can't believe that may have been the last time I would drive to his house.&nbsp; When we arrived, Efren was already there.&nbsp; Typically Efren, his welcoming remark to us was a simple statement that weighed heavy with insight, &quot;Its fucking March 1, whats up with that??&quot;&nbsp; Just a short while ago, March 1 seemed ages away, and now suddenly it actually is.&nbsp; It's been almost a year since graduation, almost a year since we started the yuppie life, and it marks the month that Chip leaves.&nbsp; MARCH SUCKS ASS.

Inside the Chipeco house, while Chip was getting last minute reminders from Tita Edith, Ef continued his spiel, &quot;Goodbye chair, goodbye wall, goodbye TV, goodbye ref, goodbye cat...&quot;&nbsp; I, on the other hand, was thinking, &quot;Goodbye inumans, goodbye tambayan, goodbye youth&quot;&nbsp; While the boys helped put all the luggages into the car, I heard Tito Jun ask Chip,

&quot;Are you sure you have everything packed...do you have a pen ready for immigration?&quot;
&quot;Yes, pa.&quot;
&quot;Good, then you're ready.&quot;
&quot;No, pa, I'm not.&quot;

Who is ever really READY to go anyway?&nbsp; 

Then, finally, the convoy to the airport.&nbsp; Considering it was 4:30 in the morning, it was a quick drive.&nbsp; Too quick.&nbsp; Before we knew it, we were parked at the Departure area getting our last hugs from Chip.&nbsp; I didn't cry when he hugged me.&nbsp; Hello.&nbsp; I'm not emotional like that. But fuck.&nbsp; When he turned his back, and was slowly walking towards the entrance to the airport, fuck.&nbsp; There were tears.&nbsp; 

Then I started singing &quot;you're leeeaaving on a jetplane, don't know when you'll be back again&quot; then everyone joined in the singing.&nbsp; Jologs na kung jologs. Haha.&nbsp; Efren even put his hands in the air and started waving.&nbsp; We all followed suit.&nbsp; Afterwards, the last glance from Chip.&nbsp; Then, he disappeared."

I hate horror movies, no-brainer movies (not all chick flicks are no-brainers ha!), action movies that are all-action-no-plot, and stressful movies with a lot of deceit.&nbsp; The saying is &quot;Relax, see a movie,&quot; not &quot;scare yourself/lose your brain/tire yourself, see a movie.&quot;

2. I can never go on a serious diet.&nbsp; Good food for me, sadly, are those which doctors call bad. But what the hell, life is short, so why must I deprive myself of what I consider simple joys?

3. I smoke and the only thing that will make me stop is my becoming pregnant...which I don't intend to make happen anytime soon.

4. With regard to friendship, I believe in &quot;a chosen few&quot; over &quot;oh I'm friends with everyone.&quot;&nbsp; If I'm gonna do a despedida, I'll probably have 15 friends over, max.&nbsp; Haha, loser na kung loser.

5. I'm a stickler for time.&nbsp; If I say I'll meet you at 1015, I'll be there at 1015, and if you're late by more than 30 minutes, I'm sure to be pissed off like hell.&nbsp; Of course, this being always on time thing isn't TRUE all the time...but if I have good reason to be late, rest assured I'll let you know before hand.

6.&nbsp; I have a hard time saying No to people.&nbsp; &quot;Sure&quot; is my usual automatic response to friends who wanna go out, family members who send me on errands..etc.&nbsp; And then when something more important comes up, and I back out last minute, people probably can't help thinking I'm just making excuses, but I'm really not.&nbsp; I know its a bad thing...so now, I'm trying my &quot;first-written-on-my-planner, first-serve&quot; rule hehe.&nbsp; But of course, my boyfriend and family are the exceptions to the rule.

7. I'm not the kind of girl who enters a mall and can't help looking at all the stores she passes by.&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp; I can't stand being in a mall for a long period of time just walking around aimlessly.&nbsp; I rarely shop, but when I do, it's a one-time-big-time thing.

8. I'm an impulse buyer for books.&nbsp; I have many books on my shelf that I haven't even opened yet, but still I keep buying more.

9. I love reading fiction from Jude Deveraux, to Rowling, Borges, Murakami, Palahniuk, Salinger, and Shakespeare.&nbsp; Non-fiction lit like biographies, and history bore me.

10. I don't have good hand-eye coordination, or hand-torso-legs coordination for that matter.&nbsp; I'm bad at sports, and I can't dance to save my life.&nbsp; Blame it on being born premature I guess hehe!

11.&nbsp; I love driving sans traffic.&nbsp; 

12. I also love being on busses, trains, and airplanes for the sole reason that I absolutely love the feeling of going somewhere.&nbsp; I have wanderlust.&nbsp; I like to travel and see the world.

13.&nbsp; I'm a beach person.&nbsp; The ocean instills in me a sense of calmness...of serenity.&nbsp; And having a really cold drink while lying down on the sand on a really hot day by the sea is heaven to me.&nbsp; 

14.&nbsp; I am annoyed by people who have bad grammar and/or bad manners (both table etiquette and social graces)

15.&nbsp; This you may find weird: I love being in the spotlight when I do something commendable (awards in school, doing something great at work, etc) but I hate celebrations for my birthday.&nbsp; Hate hate hate.&nbsp; I guess I like the ephemeral attention and approval of people when I achieve something coz it makes me feel that my efforts are appreciated, and but I don't like to get attention just because I got older haha.&nbsp; 

16.&nbsp; The only thing I put on my face is moisturizer.&nbsp; I do not wear make up.&nbsp; Nah-ah.&nbsp; Not even blush or lipstick.&nbsp; 

17.&nbsp; My taste in music is a weird combination: alternative and broadway.&nbsp; Yes, broadway.&nbsp; I memorize almost all the songs in Rent, Jesus Christ Superstar, Phantom of the Opera, and Sound of Music.&nbsp; 

18.&nbsp; I have no problems waking up early, but trust me, the morning-me is just &quot;auto pilot.&quot;&nbsp; No intellectually stimulating activities in the morning please.&nbsp; I'm more productive after lunch, and most productive at night.

19.&nbsp; When I'm sad, I'd rather be alone.&nbsp; I know my friends care for me, and will be there for me as in literally beside me when I'm down, but at my low points, I prefer a solitary moment.&nbsp; 

20. My dream job would be to be a highly paid travel journalist.&nbsp; Asaaa pa.&nbsp; My more realistic job goal would be to start my own events organizing company.&nbsp; That's probably one of my strongest assets now.&nbsp; I am fully confident that I can organize a conference, a party, a wedding, whatever event.&nbsp; 

21.&nbsp; I care about what people think about me.&nbsp; I am open to constructive criticisms about my apperance, my work, my attitude towards things, etc.&nbsp; I will listen to these criticisms, but don't expect drastic shifts from my status quo.&nbsp; 

22. I wanna learn some kind of martial art.&nbsp; I'm incapable of dieting, am not good in sports, find the gym boring...so I'm thinking learning a martial art would be the acceptable exercise for me.&nbsp; God, I need something to balance out all the food, and alcohol I gulp down my throat.

23.&nbsp; I am a generally optimistic person.&nbsp;

24. I see the best in people, and my trust is easily acquired.&nbsp; But once it is broken, it's gonna be very difficult for that person to earn it back again.&nbsp; 

25. I believe in Karma, good and bad."

"event","I've always loved traveling, and I am super thankful that my mom always gets sent on business trips and that she has the money to allow me to tag along.&nbsp; But for quite a while now, I've been feeling this urge inside me to travel on my own, for a longer period of time.&nbsp; And I don't just wanna go on vacation.&nbsp; If I'm gonna go to another country, I'd like to actually go to school, or to go on an internship, AND then go touring on the side.

If I'm gonna get post-grad studies, I'd like to do it in Europe...in the United Kingdom more specifically.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well for a lot of reasons that include the ff:

1. Master's degree programs in the UK only last for ONE YEAR.&nbsp; 

Yessir you read that right.&nbsp; Just one year if you're gonna take them full-time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like Sam, and most people brought up here in the Philippines, I have very close family ties and I am very comfortable in what people call my &quot;comfort zone.&quot;&nbsp; But if getting an MS just takes 1 year, pucha, game ako dun!&nbsp; UK pa! Which is, btw, known for business studies.

2. I absolutely LOVE Europe.&nbsp; 

I'm sorry grandma...I'm thankful that you're American, and that made me an American citizen, which is the precise reason I don't need a VISA to most everywhere in the world, but the US really doesn't appeal to me.&nbsp; Hehe!&nbsp; I love Europe and the vast cultural experiences I get whenever I'm there...I love the architecture of the structures, and the history behind them...I love the sense of adventure that continent always instills in me...and I love how it's so different from our country.&nbsp; The Philippines is practically like the US in a downgraded way eh.&nbsp; Food-wise, culture-wise, everything-wise.&nbsp; 

3.&nbsp; It's not so expensive if you think about it in the long-run.&nbsp; 

The Pound sign always scares the hell out of people, and yeah, cost of living is indeed higher in the UK. Pero one year lang naman eh!&nbsp; I've compared this to going to the US, and pucha...as per my cost-benefit analysis, panalo parin UK.&nbsp; For most schools in the states, I'm required to take time-consuming, expensive exams required for admission like the GMAT, the GRE, etc.&nbsp; And, post-grad studies in the States last for at least 2 years.&nbsp; And for my field (business management), some of them even require me to get pre-requisite subjects at their university.&nbsp; Hellloooo hassle.&nbsp; So example, Economics is a pre-req for let's say Quantitative Analysis (subject in masters program)..I have to take Eco (undergrad subject) in that university pa.


Haaaay sana matuloy!&nbsp; I want to get into a scholarship but hello that's a SUPER LONG SHOT coz - I'm not smart enough...and I'm not poor enough either. Haha! Fucker.&nbsp; So malabo ako on both academic merit based, and financial capability based.&nbsp; But nahihiya nako to ask my parents to pay for me eh.&nbsp; haay.&nbsp; Ah basta, September next year, I'm hopefully gonna be outta here."

3. To go on a Caribbean cruise.
4. To get an MBA or an equivalent master's degree from somewhere in Europe.&nbsp; Preferably the UK so its all English.
5. To get my #4 wish on a scholarship/grant or any external funding so my parents won't have to pay for my expenses.
6. To win in a prestigious writing contest (i.e. the Palanca Awards)
7. To be able to read (and finish reading) my Complete Works of Shakespeare book
8. To be able to get a job in a multinational company that would pay me a 6-digit salary per month before I'm 30 years old (gasp).

10. To experience being a columnist of some newspaper.

Nothing really beats the company of one's closest friends, and this weekend I spent time with all of them.&nbsp; Jan 9 was bikini bottom day at canyon woods and Jan 10 was fuck it day at ville sommet.

Had super late lunch at Sonya's with Sam, Sison, and Sammie.&nbsp; It was bonding galore the whole time and food trip!!!&nbsp; Ate so much salad and bread, that by the time the pasta arrived, we were already kinda full, but kain pa rin!&nbsp; When we got to Canyon Woods, Sison was at an all time high bitchy mode coz Mildred, the concierge girl, fucked up our reservations, gave our favorite room to another party, and dumped us at a ground level, kinda uglier room.&nbsp; Babuyan mode came from the need for retribution.&nbsp; We kept the veranda doors open, played ultra loud music, stained the bed sheets and rugs with vodka and softdrinks, and littered the floor with chips.&nbsp; Hahaha kadiri na kung kadiri but we wanted revenge!!!&nbsp; I was drunk enough not to care about the mess.

Jan 10, Ate Maan got married!!!&nbsp; I can't believe she and Rocky are actually married already!&nbsp; It seems like just yesterday that they were in their early 20s, and we were in our teens, always drinking at Chip's house!&nbsp; Ate Maan was an ate to us all.&nbsp; She gave us advise on love, sex, school, work....life.&nbsp; And now, WE'RE in our early 20s, and she just tied the knot.&nbsp; In about 5 years or so, kami naman ikakasal sheeeet how time flies.&nbsp; 

The throwing of the bouquet part of the reception was funny.&nbsp; When they called all the single girls to gather, no one stood up from their seat hahahahha.&nbsp; I guess coz those in their late 20s to 30s were ashamed that they were still single, and the younger ones (including Twinks and me) didn't exactly want to catch the bouquet and be deemed the next to get married.&nbsp; So Ate Maan freaking called out the names of the single women..so siempre I went.&nbsp; Fuckingshit the fucking bouquet actually hit my shoulders but I let it fall and the girl next to me got it hahaha.

The main dish of the reception was lamb.&nbsp; I didn't really enjoy it, coz I don't like its after taste.&nbsp; Pinapak ko nalang yung salmon, pork roast, and everything on the sushi bar.

I like going to weddings.&nbsp; It gets me all dreamy and shit.&nbsp; Lalo na if the wedding is really cute and not boring.&nbsp; Ate Maan's wedding was really cute and not boring.&nbsp; Their entrance was to the tune of Forever by Chris Brown hahaha laugh trip amputa.&nbsp; I think Tita Edith (Chip's mom was scandalized).&nbsp; The bride's dance with the FOB was the usual &quot;What a wonderful word&quot; by Frank Sinatra, then when the dad symbolically gave away ate maan to rocky for their dance, biglang nag hiphop nanaman.&nbsp; Also, everything was soooo beautiful.&nbsp; Garden reception and ang DAMI DAMING flowers everywhere.

This is getting long.&nbsp; But all in all, I had a GREAT weekend! I love you sam sison (gay) sammie chip twinks and sison (straight.)

P.S.&nbsp; Thank you to Francis Sison for my hair and make up. Ay make up lang pala.&nbsp; Turuan mo na nga ako mag make up para di na kita i-hassle pag may special occassion. :D"

5. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button

When someone tells you an idea about a man being born old and growing younger, and that this idea will be made into a movie, you'd think the movie to be either fantasy (child's fairytale), sci-fi, or horror (think Chuck, the scary doll, na tao pala who grew younger and evil).&nbsp; But this new film is neither of the above mentioned, and proved to be a success.&nbsp; It's a success coz it's engaging without any stressful suspense, and heartwarming without being sappy.&nbsp; Galing.&nbsp;

- Shakespeare

2008 is the year of suicides.&nbsp; A poet friend of a friend, who appeared to be so full of life, and who wrote the most beautiful poems, suddenly killed herself.&nbsp; Her friends say she tried to make her life into a poem, and when she couldn&rsquo;t reconcile the reality of what is to what it ought to be, she couldn&rsquo;t take it.&nbsp; 

A 24-year old philosophy grad student/teaching assistant locked himself up in a room inside the Ateneo Philosophy Department, sealed all the openings with plastic, and suffocated himself with carbon monoxide by burning charcoal.&nbsp; Evidence suggested it was because of depression, and people who knew him closely say his death was philosophically-natured.&nbsp; 

A college student who starred in the critically acclaimed Tanghalang Ateneo production of Othello killed himself when he found out his girlfriend cheated on him.&nbsp; 

Another college student, who was Ateneo&rsquo;s World Youth Day delegate and a member of the student council, hanged himself when the friend he asked for help in courting a girl, ended up being the girl&rsquo;s boyfriend.&nbsp; His most recent blog entry was also philosophically influenced as it spoke of betrayal and resignation, &ldquo;&hellip;blink, inner peace. in-in-in-inner peace yes this is the answer now, to lull oneself into utopic self-assurances. i have gone from nowhere, to now, here&hellip;the answer now is to dissolve into the great beyond, to get drunk on ideals and the monoliths of virtue&hellip;nakaranas na ako ng WALA, sorry padre&hellip;must finish tonight&hellip;&rdquo;

These are four suicides in the last four months, and it is very disturbing.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s makes it more disturbing aside from the rate is the fact that they are all directly connected to Ateneo, and that the cause of their deaths is indirectly connected to Philosophy.&nbsp; 
May all their souls rest in peace, but I find those four people VERY stupid.&nbsp; 

Philosophy as a required subject, is mainly for mental gymnastics.&nbsp; It aims to exercise your mind, and in doing so, puts you in a state of metaphysical unease, where you find yourself questioning your being, your beliefs, your purpose, etc etc etc.&nbsp; It can serve as an impetus to find yourself, as you grow both in age and wisdom &ndash; that&rsquo;s why it is given in the 3rd and 4th year of college, because at the age range of 19-21, people are supposed to be mature enough for it.&nbsp; It is not a means to an end, and it should not be inappropriately applied to one&rsquo;s problems and confusions.&nbsp; 

 A poet, a grad-student, an actor, a would-be politician.&nbsp; These were four very talented people, who had so much to give to the world, but didn&rsquo;t get the opportunity because of their own doing.&nbsp; What a waste."

friends are the only refuge.
- Aristotle


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took a break-up to seal the friendship.&nbsp; It was 2am on one of the worst nights of my life that my then boyfriend and I broke up.&nbsp; I called Chip to let out the rage, and he told me, &ldquo;Shut up, get some sleep like I was before you called, and I&rsquo;ll meet you at Twinkle&rsquo;s place in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, I slept not one wink, and I was already at the lobby of Twinks&rsquo; condo across Ateneo at 7am.&nbsp; The 7-Eleven people refused to sell me beer because of the Quezon City ordinance that forbids them to before 8am.&nbsp; At exactly 8am, I bought three grande bottles of San Miguel for me and made my way to Twinks&rsquo; unit.&nbsp; They were already there.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so Chip opened Pandora&rsquo;s box and I started ranting and ranting, not crying, then he hugged me and of course I started crying, because hugging makes people cry.&nbsp; He opened the bottles even if it was absurd to drink beer in the morning, and he drank a little with me even if we had a midterm in Psychology class at 11am.&nbsp; Twinkle acted as the righteous one, and read aloud important stuff from her book, stuff we all had to know before 11am.&nbsp; In retrospect, the scene is pretty funny: one girl crying while drinking beer, one boy consoling while drinking beer, and another girl walking back and forth in between them while reading aloud from a Psychology book, &ldquo;Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a disorder that&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; and shouting, &ldquo;Alam niyo, kailangan talaga natin mag aral ngayon...&rdquo;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day our friendship was sealed.&nbsp; Chip was officially my college best friend, and I was his, and Twinkle will always be Twinkle pushing her boyfriend and her boyfriend&rsquo;s best friend to do the right thing.&nbsp; Our triumvirate would grow stronger as we went through our college years.&nbsp; We remained intact even when Chip got kicked out of Legal Management, and shifted into Philosophy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Twinkle and I became friends with his new friends, and in fact, my current boyfriend was Chip&rsquo;s blockmate in Philosophy.&nbsp; The three of us would argue for argument&rsquo;s sake because we all thought ourselves to be the best among us three.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d write papers together, and criticize each other&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d practice for oral exams together, taking turns at who&rsquo;d play the student and the 2 professors.&nbsp; At the end of the day, we&rsquo;d all have pretty good grades, and we&rsquo;d hang out at Twinkle&rsquo;s condo, watching TV and/or having a drink knowing everything was worth it.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and about that Psychology midterm: I failed it.&nbsp; We got to the classroom on time, and by the time our professor finished giving all the questionnaires to the class, I&rsquo;d have fallen asleep.&nbsp; Chip was seated beside me, and shook me awake.&nbsp; This was useless because I couldn&rsquo;t focus enough to read and comprehend the questions.&nbsp; Good thing, it was a wholly multiple-choice, normal shade-A-B-C-or-D kind of exam, and I just shot gun shaded away.&nbsp; When the results came back, I found out that I got 15/60.&nbsp; I proved the statistical theory that if one is given four choices, he&rsquo;d have a 25% chance of getting the right one, by getting exactly a fourth of the total score even if I was drunk.&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp;"

- Cain


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two younger brothers. The one next to me, Yori, and I are very close.&nbsp; He is the typical middle child who is very vulnerable, plays it safe, and resigns to follow the footsteps of the older sibling (me).&nbsp; He shares with me pretty much everything that happens in his life, and he consults with me regarding pretty much every decision he makes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to be the in the receiving end of such admiration and trust, and I try very hard to be a dutiful older sister and not to screw up. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I am very happy about our relationship, and at the same time, I am scared and pressured to do things right because I know he is always watching me closely, waiting for the opportunity to imitate my actions.&nbsp; Needless to say, I have a very strong influence on him, and even a small comment I give him sticks to his mind like a commandment he will always remember and live by.
Conversely, I also learn from him specially when I&rsquo;m angry about something and my judgment is clouded, and I lean to him for help.

My youngest brother, Gino, and I, on the other hand, are not that close.&nbsp; He is also the typical youngest sibling that tries so hard to be different and deviates from the norm most of the time.&nbsp; Because of our differences in attitudes and perspective on things, we often clash and argue with me always winning of course.

But despite our differences and how I feel like killing him most of the time, I am nonetheless there for him in his times of need, and he is also there when I need him, too.&nbsp; When I need a different opinion, I don&rsquo;t go to Yori because I know he&rsquo;ll just agree with me, I instead go to Gino.&nbsp; So I guess our relationship is healthy as well in the sense that even though our opinions clash most of the time, the communication remains alive.&nbsp; I have no doubts that in the future, when he gets older, more mature, and less irritable, we would also be the best of friends."

"event","Sooner or later, we all quote our mothers.
- Bern Williams
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
One father is more than a thousand schoolmasters.
- George Herbert


My father is the luckiest man alive.&nbsp; This is because in his 63 years (and counting) here on earth, he never had a real job.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do good, and the world will take care of you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t exactly true because the person doing most of the caring for him is my mother.&nbsp; When I look at them as a couple, however, I think that it is for the betterment of their relationship that my dad is how my dad is.&nbsp; This is because my mom has a very strong personality, and subconsciously wants to control everything she can.&nbsp; Family trips are planned to the letter, with an itinerary made on an excel worksheet complete with date, time, place, and agenda in the place we are to go to.&nbsp; So if in the unlikely case that my dad steps up to fulfill the metaphorical role of being breadwinner/boss, they would clash, and our united and peaceful family as I know it would go asunder.&nbsp; 

My father and I&nbsp; do not have a close relationship.&nbsp; We rarely talk with each other, and during the few times that we do, it would just be him asking me to do an errand, or me asking him a trivia question.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to make this sound bad, but his role as a dad to me has been reduced to being a data bank.&nbsp; Because he was rigorously trained in the seminary, he is omniscient to certain degree; since I was very young, and until now that I am not a student anymore, he never failed to answer correctly every question I asked him for a school assignment (except math and science) or a task I&rsquo;d be doing for work.&nbsp; I guess the reason for this kind of relationship is that he&rsquo;s rarely around the house, and when he is, he doesn&rsquo;t exert effort to really converse.&nbsp; As an effect, I don&rsquo;t notice his presence when he&rsquo;s home, or his absence when he&rsquo;s not. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing about my dad is that I know he has made many, many mistakes in his life, but I don&rsquo;t judge him for that.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t the breadwinner of our family when he&rsquo;s supposed to (my mom is), because of him I have a number of half-siblings, and he isn&rsquo;t exactly the role model a father should be for many reasons.&nbsp; But weirdly, I don&rsquo;t harbor any angry feelings towards him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why.&nbsp; Maybe its because that no matter how grave the mistakes he has done and will do, no matter how much he could screw up, he is still a good person who really, really likes to help people, and also, he will always be my father.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother and I, on the other hand, are very close.&nbsp; She is a great role model, ever supportive of what ever I do, and ever so lenient.&nbsp; Also, she always tries to correct my flaws, and when she does so, I see it like a television commercial: you&rsquo;ve heard it a million times, you know what is coming, but you listen anyway.&nbsp; For one thing, she always criticizes my driving; she says I don&rsquo;t drive fast enough and that I press on the brakes too suddenly.&nbsp; For other thing, she always sends me on money errands to improve my financial literacy; I go to the city halls to pay taxes, which I really, really dread (government offices suck), and I go to the banks to invest money in equities, UITFs, time deposits, etc., and even my allowance when I was still a student was given on a monthly basis like a salary which was also deposited into an ATM account.&nbsp; Also, she always tells me not to trust anyone so easily and that I should stop giving money to street children because I&rsquo;m not really helping that way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She criticizes everything about me from my laziness, to my addiction to TV series which I buy on pirated DVDs and which I could watch all day long, to my cluttered room, to my dusty laptop, to my gas and Starbucks expenses, to my coming home very late, to my ugly handwriting, to my inefficient time management (cramming)&hellip;I swear the list is endless.&nbsp; But despite everything, we are extremely close maybe because I never receive her criticisms quietly; I answer back, and criticize her too!&nbsp; Communication between us is open, honest, and free flowing, and I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking with my mom is just like talking to a friend in the sense that there is no censorship in the exchange of words, and the conversation is filled with candor. With my mom, emotions are reported when experienced, and it is never to imply judgment.&nbsp; Candor does not connote disrespect.&nbsp; Rather, it implies the depth in the relationship where one person is so comfortable with the other, that he/she is confident that the other won&rsquo;t take any offense.&nbsp; I think this manifests honesty, authenticity, and maturity between persons and therefore, I am confident in saying that my relationship with my mom is nothing short of healthy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I am already working, my mom has backed off a bit on the nagging and the criticisms.&nbsp; I welcome this change because it signifies trust from her on a different level; she&rsquo;s now letting me fly on my own wings without much guidance.&nbsp; But sometimes, like when I&rsquo;m driving and I put on a sudden stop, I hear my mom&rsquo;s voice in my mind, and I know exactly what she would have been saying, and this makes me smile."

"event","I travel not to go anywhere, but to go.
I travel for travel&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; The great affair is to move.
- Robert Louis Stevenson

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;For the record, I am not a materialistic person.&nbsp; Regularly shopping for clothes, shoes, and bags do not appeal to me.&nbsp; Aside from a cellular phone, I do not care for gadgets, except for a very primitive model of an ipod to turn off the world when I commute to work everyday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a picky eater, and I abhor spending excessively on food (all eat-all-you-cans are rip-offs.)&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t watch television much, and I&rsquo;d rather buy or borrow DVDs.&nbsp; 

I rarely wear a watch, though I&rsquo;d like to train myself to, so I don&rsquo;t have to get my cell phone when I have to check for the time.&nbsp; I used to love playing tennis, and swimming, but I don&rsquo;t anymore because my chest hurts when I do with my lungs threatening to burst.&nbsp; I smoke, and I can&rsquo;t seem to quit.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like sweets, but I love coffee, and I don&rsquo;t get why people like the combination. I don&rsquo;t like being late or canceling appointments if I can help it, because I&rsquo;m sort of a stickler for schedules.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like artists that much because I find them weird, but I appreciate works of art.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like extremely loud music, and extremely loud persons, for as Desiderata put it, they are vexatious to the spirit.&nbsp; I love reading, but I don&rsquo;t appreciate poetry that much.&nbsp;

 I don&rsquo;t want a big house when I settle down because I like everything to be a few steps away (I&rsquo;m a lazy condominium type); I don&rsquo;t want a big house also because I misplace things easily and I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t have the willpower to look around a big area; I don&rsquo;t want a big house because I plan to be out of it most of the time&hellip;I may not like many things for many reasons, but if there is one thing I really love and I wish with all my heart that I would have the economic capacity to do, it would be to travel.&nbsp; 

I love cars, busses, trains, and airplanes.&nbsp; I love the feeling of going somewhere &ndash; whether to a local destination, or abroad &ndash; for the sake of going.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there is a language barrier, or if the place is slightly dangerous, so long as it is new to me.&nbsp; I like the feeling of being mobile, of being in translation.&nbsp; I like going on adventures and experiencing things first hand, for pictures can never satiate this lust.&nbsp; I like the feeling of immersion, of being part of something completely alien to me, even if it&rsquo;s just temporary.&nbsp; I like seeing and learning how different cultures do the most normal things.&nbsp; 

I find it funny how Americans generally have a great penchant for small talk, and how the British always seem polite even when they&rsquo;re angry.&nbsp; I find it slightly irritating that the French enshrine their language so much that they actually refuse to speak English to foreigners even if they know how.&nbsp; I find it weird seeing Mercedes Benzes as taxis in Germany, Peugeots as taxis in France, and Volkswagens as taxis in Mexico, when here in our country, these cars are luxury.&nbsp; Why is marijuana legal in Amsterdam, and why do Japanese love biking so much?&nbsp;

 People ask me why I went to the top of the Empire State, or why I was so excited to go to Anne Frank&rsquo;s house, or why I found it so cool touring the United Nations, or why I bothered to go to the Louvre just to see the Mona Lisa, or why I went to Versailles just to see King Louie&rsquo;s room of mirrors, or why I wasted money to watch Les Miserables in London, or the Phantom in New York, and to all these questions, I answered: Because.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t pinpoint a word to describe the feeling of actually going to those places, so for the lack of better term, I&rsquo;d describe it as &ldquo;surreal.&rdquo;&nbsp; 

Indeed, visiting these places gives me great joy, but while I like being detached from home for a while, I still love the feeling of going back to it more.&nbsp; Yes, no matter how beautiful other countries may be, I would always still long for the Philippines.&nbsp; With all its flaws as a country (the dirt, the traffic, government&rsquo;s inefficiency), its still the only home for me because it is where the people I love are, and it made me who I am."

"event","Ahh&hellip;the Ateneo&hellip;
I&rsquo;ve spent my happiest days there.
- Jose Rizal


Knowledge is elitist.&nbsp; The chances of getting accepted into a top university is directly proportional to how good one&rsquo;s high school is&hellip;and whether luck plays on his side or not.&nbsp; I am not from the likes of Philippine Science (whose graduates usually go through the predicament of choosing which college scholarship offer to accept), or St. Jude (which produces god-like, math-proficient people) or other high schools of outstanding academic reputation.&nbsp; I am from one of the &ldquo;others,&rdquo; and while I will be always proud to be a product of Colegio San Agustin, I cannot pretend that I wasn&rsquo;t one of those who gambled largely on innate intelligence and luck when I took the college entrance exams.&nbsp; Thankfully, I got accepted into the top 4 universities of our country, and I chose to go to the Ateneo.&nbsp; I could not believe I was one of the 2000 students (out of the aspiring 15,000) who actually passed, and I wanted nothing more than to prove that I am a worthy member of this elite group.&nbsp; Proving my worth turned out to be the greatest wrestling match of my life, where my opponent was no one else but myself. 

Adjusting was more than difficult.&nbsp; As a freshman, I had to withstand my professors and their &ldquo;I assume&hellip;&rdquo; lines.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assume you have learned (insert topic) in high school, so we may now begin with (insert topic of next level) now.&rdquo; &ldquo;I assume you people know how to read and to comprehend and to do so speedily&hellip;I want chapters 1-4 mastered by tomorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I assume you have near perfect grammar skills&hellip; criteria for the first paper will be 50% grammar, and 50% content&hellip;if I so much as see a run-on sentence, or a dangling preposition, it will be your doom.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 I&rsquo;m not sure if the others felt the same way, but I was extremely intimidated by these statements.&nbsp; I had to learn to work smart, instead of to work hard.&nbsp; Mere diligence only got me running out of time.&nbsp; I had to re-learn how to read, to get the gist and to drill it into my mind.&nbsp; I had to re-learn speaking in front of an audience, using the appropriate words, driving a point effectively, and appearing to be confident even if my heart was beating 1 million times faster than it should.&nbsp; But the toughest thing I had to deal with was facing the fact that my high school friends who have gone to &ldquo;easier&rdquo; schools, always got the accolades, were always on the dean&rsquo;s list, even if their effort was but a miniscule fraction of mine.&nbsp; Academic pride was very important to me in high school, and I had to swallow the whole cup of it because I knew in my heart that I was getting more out of college. 

By my second year, I had developed a work ethic that was effective for me.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t work during the day, and in parts, so I did everything continuously at night, taking short breaks when needed.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t work without coffee and cigarettes; my brain simply won&rsquo;t function without these substances.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t work way ahead of schedule because the quality of my work suffered from unavoidable laxity; pressure had become the fuel to my creativity and wit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep suddenly was overrated, junk food more appreciated, and alcohol a necessity.&nbsp; A 4-hour shut-eye became the norm, and I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend how other people could sleep the whole 8; what a waste of time!&nbsp; McDonalds, Tapa King, and Yellow Cab comprised my diet.&nbsp; I drank with friends to mourn a pathetic grade, and I drank with friends to celebrate an A; I drank with friends when we had nothing to do, when we had problems, when we just wanted each others&rsquo; company, and the most mundane of days ceased to be insignificant.&nbsp; 

I became aware of my strengths, as well as my weaknesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found out that Legal Management was not for me, but I refused to shift out because I loved the dignity coming from Ateneo&rsquo;s School of Management brings, and it was unacceptable for me not to graduate on time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very thankful for my friends because we supported each other.&nbsp; Working in groups and peer reviews proved to be helpful and I welcomed constructive criticism.&nbsp; I helped friends with their essays as I was helped with Accounting and Finance. 

Junior year, as it always is, was the most difficult obstacle as academic requirements became more inhumane.&nbsp; At the end of our sophomore year, almost 10 of my friends have either been forced to shift out to other courses or kicked out of school completely, and the filtering did not stop in our third year.&nbsp; The pressure was tougher.&nbsp; I had to juggle my law subjects with management ones and the mind shifts from numerical excel worksheets to flowery sentences in legal texts were almost unbearable.&nbsp; Indeed, mathematical computations translated into hands-on business incubator projects, and the memorization of legal provisions translated into sound arguments did not mix.&nbsp; 

In addition to that, this was also the year level when Philosophy and Theology became heavy burdens.&nbsp; No matter what one&rsquo;s course was, he was required to take 12 units of Philosophy and 12 units of Theology along with other core subjects, in addition to their major subjects.&nbsp; And to say that Jesuit education in these areas was intense was an extreme understatement.&nbsp; Imagine racking your brains out trying to come up with an eloquent explanation of Being or of Nothingness or trying to articulate &ldquo;that which makes a thing what it is,&rdquo; parallel to a human person&rsquo;s existence (what comprises the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of your person?).&nbsp; Then when you finally get it, the euphoria is short-lived because you realize this is only 1 of the 10 thesis statements you have to master for oral exam day.&nbsp; And you can&rsquo;t make bola your professor because what is measured is the tightness of the thinking process you&rsquo;ve exuded and not how cool your answer sounds.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s mind-boggling, and you just want to sleep for 100 hours after the exam, but then you can&rsquo;t because you have a Marketing midterm the next day.&nbsp; By the end of the year, around 30 LM students have been kicked out, and though I was one of those hanging by a thread, I thank God I wasn&rsquo;t one of them. 

When senior year came, I told myself I had to make a dent in the system that has molded me for the past three years.&nbsp; I had to make the dean&rsquo;s list come hell or high water.&nbsp; After all, I was not the same person I was in my freshman year; I had adjusted and I was made of sterner stuff this time.&nbsp; The battle was three-fourths done, and I had come to thrive with the pressure, romancing the struggle in a relationship of love and hate.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t feign confidence anymore; I had it at my beck and call.&nbsp; Not coming from a very reputable high school was immaterial because every one of us left was now a true Atenean.&nbsp; I no longer shuddered at a 50-page paper, I said, &ldquo;Bring it on!&rdquo;&nbsp; I no longer cringed at another business audit project; I looked forward to it.&nbsp; Give me 100 pages to read tonight, and I said, sure, I&rsquo;ll give you a substantial 3-page summary and oral report tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Give me five long tests in one day, and I still assured you a good grade.&nbsp; My mantra was: Fire on me your biggest guns, Ateneo, and I guarantee I&rsquo;ll retaliate in the way you expect me to, and more, because you have taught me well.&nbsp; 

In the end, I was indeed on the dean&rsquo;s list&hellip;for both the first and second semester.&nbsp; I remember, I wasn&rsquo;t even able to attend the Honors&rsquo; Assembly because I watched a Lea Salonga concert that night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sayang naman,&rdquo; my boyfriend told me, &ldquo;Ngayon ka lang aakyat ng stage.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Lea matters more&hellip;and besides, what&rsquo;s a certificate?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it nothing but ink on paper?&rdquo;"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 24th of December, at 6am, we boarded the roro that would take us and our van from Sorsogon to Samar.&nbsp; The hour-long trip on the boat was a worthy experience in itself as it was my first time to see so many cars and buses cramped together at the bottom of a boat, while the passengers withstood the tremendously bumpy ride, struggling to find a comfortable spot upstairs.&nbsp; We arrived in Allen, Northern Samar, at around 7am, and after breakfast, began the 9-hour drive to our town, Tanauan, Leyte.&nbsp; The roads of Samar, are by far, the worst of the worst that I&rsquo;ve seen across the globe.&nbsp; They are bereft of cement or asphalt, and there are more potholes than flat surfaces; it did not help that the heavy rains that day covered the potholes with water, rendering it impossible for my dad to ascertain if the holes were deep or shallow.&nbsp; After about 40 minutes of driving, we found ourselves passing through a pothole so deep that our heads hit the ceiling of our van because of the impact.&nbsp; Seconds later, the alarm for &ldquo;low on oil&rdquo; sounded, at first slowly, then suddenly rapidly, and soon enough, our van stalled &ndash; engine oil was on &ldquo;empty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The impact from the pothole cracked open the crank case of our van (where engine oil is stored), and since it is made of aluminum, mechanics could not give it a quick fix; it was irreparable they said, we had to replace the part.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; We ended up spending 9 hours of the day before Christmas, stranded in the middle of nowhere, and since the entire family subscribed to the same cell phone service provider that had no signal in that area, we were isolated.&nbsp; Later, residents told us that we were in Bgy. Palanit, San Isidro, Northern Samar &ndash; an area where numerous hold-ups and murders take place.&nbsp; With the help of the residents, the policemen and army soldiers sent to help and guard us, and the mayor&rsquo;s brother, we were able to find a hauler and a forwarder truck that would transport our van to Tacloban City, Leyte despite the fact that it was Christmas Eve, and a van we could rent to bring us to our town.&nbsp; We were able to leave Samar at 7pm, and because of the terrible, terrible roads, we traveled at an average of 40-50 kph.&nbsp; Consequently, when the clock struck 12, we were still struggling in Samar, nowhere near Leyte.&nbsp; It was my first time to celebrate Christmas on the road.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder what the governors and congressmen of the Samar provinces are doing about their roads.&nbsp; The Pan-Philippine highway was constructed to connect Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao through a continuous road, but alas, it is discontinued in Samar.&nbsp; The car-shop in Tacloban City tells us that more than 50 cars were brought to their shop, just this Christmas season, all because of damages similar to ours.&nbsp; Good roads are a characteristic of first-world countries, but how will our beloved Philippines achieve the efficiency and productivity it aspires for if there exists roads such as those in Samar?&nbsp; Trade necessitates good roads; Samar and Leyte, for example, are agriculturally rich lands but how will the produce be transported to Manila and other places if the roads connecting the venues for retail remain in a decrepit state?&nbsp; Tourism necessitates good roads; since we pushed through with touring the entirety of Leyte for the remaining duration of our vacation, I know for a fact that just like the Bicol region, the Visayas boasts of sights at par with those that I&rsquo;ve seen abroad.&nbsp; But how will these places be appreciated if they are made unreachable due to cruel and unfriendly thoroughfares?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Because of the bittersweet experiences and emotions I&rsquo;ve been through, I will certainly never forget this year&rsquo;s Christmas.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen the grandeur of the places our country offers, alongside the inconvenience one has to endure to get there; I&rsquo;ve been exposed to the intolerable fixers at ship ports, and robbery/murder-prone areas, alongside hospitable residents, and kind army men who never hesitated to help us in our time of need; I&rsquo;ve experienced isolation and being so far away from my comfort zone in Manila, alongside meeting hitherto unknown relatives.&nbsp; Indeed, this year&rsquo;s Christmas will be one I&rsquo;ll always remember."

"event","I woke up this morning to the sound of my two younger brothers beating each other up in the next room.&nbsp; The object of the conflict was simple: using the computer; the aggravating factors were even simpler: the older one&rsquo;s assertion of superiority and the younger one&rsquo;s cry for equality.&nbsp; Because they are adolescents, it isn&rsquo;t surprising to witness the use of force instead of rationality, and a fistfight instead of a discussion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But overly stupid fights like these are not only seen in the family setting.&nbsp; In fact, the family is but a microcosm of society, of the world.&nbsp; Numerous wars in mankind&rsquo;s history have been caused by the assertion of superiority by the strong &ndash; military supremacy, economic competition, ideological prevalence &ndash; and the cry for equality by the weak.&nbsp; And this is the result of envy, spite, revenge and other evil forms scattering far and wide in our world. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existence of these evil things is an embodiment of the myth of Prometheus and Pandora.&nbsp; In the story we see the curiosity of Pandora unleash a &lsquo;multitude of plagues for man&rsquo;s body and mind&rsquo; and thus resulted in the degradation of the world from a Golden age of truth and innocence to the Iron Age of &lsquo;fraud and the wicked love of gain.&rsquo;&nbsp; But as stated in the myth, all the evil contents inside the jar, which Pandora opened, escaped except hope.&nbsp; That is why, as it was then and as it is now, no matter how seemingly grave and discouraging our situation becomes, hope never really leaves us.&nbsp; No hardship is too harsh for as long as we have hope.

"event","Why do we study the Greek and Roman Classics?&nbsp; What makes these ancient literary works relevant today, more than 2000 years after they were first written? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a nutshell, it is because they have defined humanity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without any external influence, or attempt to study the past, humanity is only as old as a person is.&nbsp; So for a young person like myself who is 21 years old, humanity has only existed for a quarter of a century as well.&nbsp; But 21 years is even less than a dot on the whole painting we call humanity, and we can never understand the whole picture without attempting to understand those who have come and gone before us.&nbsp; And that is why we study history, and literature for that matter &ndash; so we can try to grasp the attitudes, values, and ideals that have formed the human race through the years, and in the process, molded the culture our generation has been born into.&nbsp; By studying and reflecting on who came before us, we come to know who we are, and who would be better to study and reflect on than those who have defined humanity itself?&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greeks (who influenced the Romans) have defined humanity because they are credited for being the pioneers in asserting ideas on what is good, right, and beautiful, and although there are many flaws in their culture (discrimination of women, slavery, homosexuality), the ideas they have begun have become the ideals we all aspire for today precisely because Greek culture is the basis of Western culture and identity as we know it at present.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is Greek culture anyway?&nbsp; How similar or different is it from ours?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earliest known product of Greek literature is the Iliad by Homer.&nbsp; The story begins in medias res, in the 10th year of the Trojan War.&nbsp; The Greeks live by a certain guest-host-friendship agreement, where the beneficiary of gifts gain honor, while the benefactor gains alliance for future needs. And we know that the war came about because Paris, prince of Troy, broke this agreement with the Achaeans when he eloped with Helen, Queen of Sparta.&nbsp; In an appropriate angry response to this, Menelaus, Helen&rsquo;s husband, sought the help of his brother, Agamemnon, in waging war with the Trojans, for 2 reasons: a.) to get Helen back, and more importantly, b.) to save face.&nbsp;

 It must be noted that the Greeks are characterized by a Shame culture, where the greatest risk is dishonor, or what they call the loss of time (respect from peers in one&rsquo;s lifetime).&nbsp; The only way to redeem oneself, in a Greek point of view, is through revenge, and the achievement of kleos (glory; immortalized in art after one&rsquo;s death) in a moment of aristeia (moment of glory; moment one achieves kleos).&nbsp; Achilles, the Achaeans&rsquo; best warrior in the war, is the perfect embodiment of this process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the guest-host-friendship agreement is still very much manifested in our life, especially in foreign relations.&nbsp; One example would be when our president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, because the US has always given us economic aid, expressed her all-out support for the USA&rsquo;s &ldquo;war on terror,&rdquo; even if she knew (well I&rsquo;d like to think that she did) that that whole Iraq thing is so utterly stupid.&nbsp; In 2005, she came to her senses when a Filipino was held hostage in Iraq and GMA backed out from the Coalition of the Willing.&nbsp; 

It&rsquo;s funny that she was the first one to join the coalition and she was also the first to leave.&nbsp; In contrast to the Greeks, however, our culture is not a Shame culture, but a Guilt culture.&nbsp; Being &ldquo;the best&rdquo; in our respective fields (ar&ecirc;te) never outweighs the outlook of conscience and morality we have in everything we do.&nbsp; I think this is because we are Christians, who believe that that the good would be generously rewarded by God in the after-life, unlike the Greeks, who believe that man becomes a mere &ldquo;shade of himself&rdquo; &ndash; insignificant, and unworthy &ndash; after death.&nbsp; As the shade of Achilles states in Book 11 of Homer&rsquo;s next epic, the Odyssey, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather live working as a wage laborer with no land&hellip;than lord over the wasted dead.&rdquo;

In comparison to Homer&rsquo;s ar&ecirc;te, Roman writer Virgil speaks about pietas, which means dutifulness in the highest degree, or the steadfast commitment to one&rsquo;s destiny/calling.&nbsp; While the Iliad is about individual time, revenge, and kleos, and the Odyssey is about nostos or homecoming, the Aeneid is about so much more, about something much deeper.&nbsp; More than individual glory or a safe homecoming, the Aeneid is about fulfilling Aeneas&rsquo; destiny of founding Rome.&nbsp; By inserting a sense of divine mission in his literary work, Virgil has deepened the Homeric values in a way that is unique to him; according to him, &ldquo;It is the lack of pietas that causes misfortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; Aeneas, the protagonist of the story, is an exemplary embodiment of pietas because of his steadfast commitment to his destiny despite feeling hopeless, helpless, and finding love along the way.&nbsp; His love interest in the story is Dido, who because of being overcome by passion and emotion, forgot her husband too quickly, forgot her role as queen, and in the end, died, when Aeneas left her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, it is a very rare and wonderful thing to know what one&rsquo;s calling is; and it is even more wonderful if you actually get to pursue it.&nbsp; With the myriad options available, the influence of the media, and the fast-paced lifestyle everyone lives by, it has become a difficult task to find time for solitary reflection and to discover one&rsquo;s true identity.&nbsp; And it doesn&rsquo;t help that unlike Homer and Virgil&rsquo;s stories, we now don&rsquo;t have gods who actively help us when we need it, and who tell us what our calling or destiny is.&nbsp; In contrast to the characters in those stories who know what they are born to do, the paradigm instilled to us now by our elders is that, &ldquo;You make your own destiny.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, in a sense, our life is arguably more difficult because it is up to us to discover our own calling AND up to us to be fully committed to its pursuit.&nbsp; But regardless of the modern impediments to find our mission in life, the important thing is that once we discover what it is, we must pursue it wholeheartedly with pietas, and not let anything stop us from becoming the person we were born to be. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another famous Greek literary work is Agamemnon by Aeschylus.&nbsp; This is the tragic story of the House of Atreus.&nbsp; The theme of the tragedy is philos-aphilos, or hate-in-love.&nbsp; Agamemnon is succession of complex collisions, with each character acting with an immense force of passion.&nbsp; Agamemnon is a man full of pride, and the passion for power.&nbsp; Because of these attributes, he conquered most of Greece, sacrificed his daughter Iphigeneia, sacked Troy, and brought back home a beautiful mistress named Cassandra.&nbsp; Clytaemnestra, his wife, responded to these actions with a passionate force as well.&nbsp; Her love for her daughter Iphigeneia resulted in hatred for Agamemnon leading her to take his cousin Aegisthus as a lover, and killing Agamemnon upon his homecoming.&nbsp; Ironically, she still had love for Agamemnon in spite of everything for she also killed Cassandra in a jealous rage.&nbsp; Indeed, Agamemnon is a tale of passion and revenge, with each tragic event having a consequence in another tragic event, until finally, Orestes (Agamemnon&rsquo;s son) comes home and kills both Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus, thereby bringing justice to all the heinous crimes committed by the couple, and putting everything back into balance.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel to this are two other notable tragedies, which are: Oedipus Rex and Antigone by Sophocles.&nbsp; Oedipus, like Agamemnon, is also a person with great pride or hubris &ndash; which was of course his tragic flaw or hamartia &ndash; and when pride for wealth and power become too great for even wisdom to restrain, one&rsquo;s downfall is assured.&nbsp; This is exactly what happened to Oedipus; he brought his fate upon himself because of who he was.&nbsp; Because he was self-sufficient, he ran away from Corinth, thinking he could escape the prophecy of him killing his father and marrying his mother by leaving who he thought were his natural parents; this of course brought him to Thebes, where he unknowingly met his real father, and thereafter fulfilled both prophecies.&nbsp; Because he was daring, he killed Laius, who was he real father.&nbsp; Because he was intelligent, he solved the riddle, which gave him the right (by popular demand) to marry the queen of Thebes, Jocasta, who was in reality his real mother.&nbsp; And finally, because he had a sense of public spirit, he ironically, investigated the murder of Laius, leading him to find out it was he who was the murderer after all.&nbsp; After that, he blinded himself literally when he was no longer blind figuratively.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After both Oedipus and Jocasta died, their sons Eteocles and Polyneices fought over the kingship of Thebes, but in the end both died at each other&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Creon, their maternal uncle, got the crown.&nbsp; Creon refused to have Polyneices&rsquo; body buried, but Antigone, his sister, buried him anyway.&nbsp; Antigone was simply obeying the divine law, which speaks of the solemn duty of women to perform the funeral rites of their dead.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the victims in the tragedies bring their pre-destined fate upon themselves precisely because of their character, because of who they are.&nbsp; Pride is a tragic flaw that assures its possessor his downfall.&nbsp; But today, pride isn&rsquo;t a flaw that&rsquo;s common among people; rather, it is greed.&nbsp; People of the present, especially the youth, always want more than what they need.&nbsp; We are a materialistic generation, with three words constantly ringing in our minds: consume, consume, consume.&nbsp; We want more clothes, more bags, more cars, more jewelry.&nbsp; We gamble, and if we win, we gamble more to win more.&nbsp; And this is our downfall for the more we want more, the more we lose in the end, because we can&rsquo;t win all the time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of a Greek comedy is Lysistrata by Aristophanes.&nbsp; This is a tale of women, led by Lysistrata, who withhold sex from their husbands until they sign a treaty of peace to end the Peloponnesian War.&nbsp; This play depicts the attempt of women to contribute their thoughts about society and policy-making in a patriarchal society.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The play&rsquo;s anti-war theme is very much relevant today given the Iraq situation.&nbsp; In the Peloponnesian War, the conflict was between Athen and Sparta &ndash; two nations that shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting, but helping each other because they are of the same heritage.&nbsp; Now, the conflict is primarily between the Americans and the people of Iraq.&nbsp; These people shouldn&rsquo;t be fighting each other as well because although they don&rsquo;t have the same heritage, both these races &ndash; along with all humans &ndash; belong to one race, which is the human race.&nbsp; We should help each other out in times of need and exist amicably side-by-side instead of killing each other.&nbsp; Indeed, war is a very ugly thing and nothing good could possibly come out of it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undeniably, our culture is so much different from that of the Greeks.&nbsp; But even if this is so, theirs is a culture that is worth reflecting upon deeply.&nbsp; The ideals of arete, and pietas, are values we must strive for today in everything we do; we must always aim to be the best in our respective fields, settling with nothing less than excellence, and we must always have a steadfast commitment to our calling, or to anything we begin to endeavor.&nbsp; Furthermore, we must always be wary of hubris, remembering that pride is a tragic flaw that assures our downfall, as well as all the other human flaws we are so prone to like greed, sloth, or lust.&nbsp; Finally, we must reflect deeply on the fact that war was despised even 2000 years ago, as it should be now.&nbsp; War is a useless, stupid, thing brought about by hate and greed, and the world would be a much, much better place if this did not exist at all."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just recently gotten back together with the only guy I&rsquo;ve been in a serious relationship with in the last 5 years.&nbsp; There were big changes in our lives and our selves, which led to big fights, which in turn led to break-ups. There were flings after we&rsquo;ve broken up before, but nothing more.&nbsp; Now, we&rsquo;re back together, and we&rsquo;re taking it slow.&nbsp; Now, more than ever, and after reading Scott Peck&rsquo;s weird essay, I am convinced that I indeed love him &ndash; past the infatuation and honeymoon stage, past the dependency and possessiveness, past falling in love &ndash; just love, right in the thick of it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, there were lots of set-backs in our relationship.&nbsp; One factor is that when we first got together, we were very young (high school).&nbsp; He was a permanent part of my daily routine and as time passed on, the predictability has tolled upon its pros and cons.&nbsp; Predictability offered the security that he would always be there.&nbsp; But at the same time, it fostered monotony, and being young, I wanted to try new things, and wanted space from him, keeping in mind, that he would always be there&hellip;but he wasn&rsquo;t and I don&rsquo;t blame him.&nbsp; I broke with him for stupid reasons.&nbsp; I screwed it up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got back together towards the end of freshman year in college, we tried so hard to get things back to the way we were when we were happy in high school.&nbsp; We tried to get the old &ldquo;us&rdquo; back &ndash; which was hard and downright impossible since we were already in college, were in different schools, were older, and simply not the same persons we were before.&nbsp; This lack of predictability fostered the lack of security and we weren&rsquo;t used to it.&nbsp; The lack led to dependency, possessiveness, and frustration because we couldn&rsquo;t achieve the ideals we had.&nbsp; He was the one who gave up and broke it off this time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few months of silence, we started going out and spending a lot of time together again &ndash; but this time as &ldquo;friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; During this &ldquo;friends&rdquo; era, a lot of things have happened.&nbsp; There were traumatic experiences (hospitalizations, running over a person!), unforgettable experiences, forgettable experiences, fights, making up, and lots more, and these things turned our relationship into something deeper than it ever was before.&nbsp; He is the one person that knows me inside out, and I am that to him as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, we&rsquo;re officially a couple again, taking take 3 in a serious boyfriend-girlfriend relationship that looks like it&rsquo;ll grow and last.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve both made mistakes, and a lot more mistakes after those mistakes, and contrary to the belief of some of my friends who say that we should give up, I think that all it means is that we both still have a lot of room to grow.&nbsp; I believe that mistakes and learning from them is a sign that love advances.&nbsp; And when love advances, people should take second chances (and third chances too!) in order to promote that growth.&nbsp; Love isn&rsquo;t easy.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s easy, then it&rsquo;s effortless.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s effortless, then it&rsquo;s not love to begin with.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my opinion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a relationship, sometimes it feels like its heaven-sent one day, and then the next, you&rsquo;re back in hell.&nbsp; Sometimes it feels that it just gets more and more confusing everyday, like it&rsquo;s going nowhere, and that you want to just walk away.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always a mixture, a push and a pull, extremities fighting for the victory of the last stand.&nbsp; But the thing is, I believe that what holds a relationship together is the will of both parties to hold it in, and make balance.&nbsp; Love, ultimately, boils down to choice &ndash; both will and action &ndash; and the parties must exert utmost effort in keeping their end of the bargain.&nbsp; Of course, sometimes, one would have to pull the string harder to reach balance because the other is having some difficulty.&nbsp; Sometimes, one is compelled to exert more effort than the other.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hang up, he calls.&nbsp; He gets mad, I apologize.&nbsp; I screw up, he understands.&nbsp; He becomes narrow-minded and stubborn, I become patient.&nbsp; I walk out, he follows me.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this time, we&rsquo;re doing better with the balancing act. Maybe it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re older.&nbsp; Maybe we&rsquo;re more mature. I know there will be more fights, but then again, there&rsquo;ll be more making up.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be more misunderstandings, and then more apologies.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be more mistakes, and more learning.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be more growth&hellip;and this time we&rsquo;ll do it one step at a time.&nbsp; This time, we&rsquo;ll take it slow.&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;m being overly optimistic about this whole thing&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; All I know is that I&rsquo;m certain this time will be a lot better than the past."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Welcome home,&rdquo; the immigration officer said to me smiling as I presented to him my blue passport when I went to New York City last year to spend my semestral break.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s one of the privileges of being a dual citizen, I am exempted from the tough screening the people in the &ldquo;Aliens&rdquo; line get upon entering the United States.&nbsp; As I waited for my friend who was of course taking much longer in that line, and who was unsurprisingly chosen for &ldquo;random&rdquo; inspection, I felt a surge of guilt towards my fellow Filipinos.&nbsp; If not for a grandmother with American roots, I would have also been in the &ldquo;Aliens&rdquo; line with my friend, enduring the indirect discrimination and hassle (Filipinos get interviewed longer and always get chosen for random inspection of luggage) that comes along with being a Filipino.&nbsp; But no, I escaped out of a mere technicality and though I&rsquo;m happy and grateful for it, I can&rsquo;t help feeling guilty too.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; Life is hard of a Filipino especially if one belongs to the lower class.&nbsp; Here in his own country, he would probably roam the streets the whole day, enduring intense heat or heavy rain, just to sell one stick of cigarette, one cob of corn, one piece of mango. With over 70% of the population below the poverty line, most people don&rsquo;t have any other option; they can only sell a little and can therefore only buy a little as well. The Philippines fosters a very small degree of retail and I know it&rsquo;s not because Filipinos don&rsquo;t have a big appetite. As Nick Joaquin puts it, the Filipino heritage is a heritage of smallness, operating on such a tiny scale and more often than not, the returns are never proportional to the effort; a Filipino labors so much and get so little in return.&nbsp; And so he goes abroad in search of greener pastures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not part of that statistic and the case is very different for me.&nbsp; Here in my country, life for me is very comfortable and this luxury, admittedly, is far from being proportional to the effort I exert in school or at home; I don&rsquo;t work for what I have now yet I am enjoying life so much, sometimes living outside my means when I splurge on my credit card.&nbsp; When I go abroad, it is not in search for greener pastures because my pastures here are as green as it could be, but for a vacation.&nbsp; I am lucky to be born in a well-off family and I have escaped life&rsquo;s harshness thanks to my parents.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the one month that I was in New York, my two great escapes dawned on me greatly and I felt I have to maximize my good fortune of being an American citizen and my being pretty well-off.&nbsp; Most Filipinos would do anything to fix their papers for an opportunity to go abroad and earn more, and here I am with no problem with that.&nbsp; Because of this, I was so tempted to study in New York especially when my cousins were convincing me that it was a good idea and Fordham University said they would credit my units in Ateneo.&nbsp; I saw it as a new opportunity to be independent and to do something out of the Filipino heritage of smallness; studying abroad would not be operating on a tiny scale, in fact it would be a very, very big leap and challenge to prove my worth as a Filipino amongst other cultures.&nbsp; And besides, the search for something new is not necessarily an attempt to escape something bad.&nbsp; Sometimes, it is merely wanting something different from the norm.&nbsp; In this case, the new thing should be something worthwhile for it to justify the effort of deviating from the status quo, which by itself isn&rsquo;t so bad at all.&nbsp; And at that time, living in New York seemed to be pretty worthwhile.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when I told my mom that kids in the States were normally out of their parents&rsquo; house at age 18, she was reluctant about the whole idea, saying that I was too young for that and that she didn&rsquo;t want to let go of me just yet.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s one positive thing about the Filipino heritage: we really do have close family ties.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s true that we think small and do small and that because of that, we are impoverished relative to other nationalities, but at least we&rsquo;re happy in the company of our family.&nbsp; One article in Time Magazine I remember describes Filipinos as being &ldquo;hungry but happy&rdquo; and I laughed but realized it&rsquo;s quite true.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so my New York game plan is postponed for now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll probably do it after college and get a masters degree there and that&rsquo;s one thing to look forward to.&nbsp; In fact, on the flight back to the Philippines, I was all smiles because of this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mabuhay! Maligayang pagbabalik,&rdquo; said the immigration officer to me smiling as I presented to him this time my green passport.&nbsp; Yes indeed, it&rsquo;s good to be back home&hellip;to my real home."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in high school, I liked the idea of learning and getting high grades and I got them.&nbsp; Being the top of the class was a tradition and this proved to be worth it because come college, I got accepted into the Ateneo de Manila University.&nbsp; This looked like an opportunity to uphold my tradition of academic excellence because after all, Ateneo has its own tradition of producing excellent students.&nbsp; However, as the merely average QPIs kept on arriving, this became a reality check and some changes in my viewpoint on life began.&nbsp; Thus, I would say that my being an Atenean is a constant struggle between the tradition of excellence I wish I still had and the innovation of my character because I don&rsquo;t have it.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; One reality check I&rsquo;ve gotten here in school happened very recently when a reflection paper was returned and for the first time ever, I got a low grade for an essay. In my opinion, people try to get things perfect in art because it&rsquo;s really hard to do so in real life; they impart some valuable message through a perfect movie or poem, and, trigger some hidden emotion through a perfect painting or song.&nbsp; For me, I&rsquo;ve always tried to perfect the art of writing an essay, putting in flare without compromising the content or my honesty, so when my paper came short of perfection, it proved to be quite a shattering experience and a big break in my daily life because I thought I more or less had mastery over that art.&nbsp; But I wasn&rsquo;t really depressed or anything because as the saying goes: charge it to experience.&nbsp; Besides, unlike before, I&rsquo;ve already realized that letter grades aren&rsquo;t the measure of who I am, though they do prove to be effective roots for reflection.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excellence for me now is not limited by getting an A, though As do create a big smile on my face, but by accepting constructive criticism and giving it another shot.&nbsp; That experience pushed me farther away from the tradition I once had and nearer to the innovation of me.&nbsp; But by attempting to innovate myself, I am once again pushed back in the direction of excellence and I again find myself in the middle, where the tension is felt the most.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another illustration of this tug-of-war is my complacency.&nbsp; Being accepted into one of the country&rsquo;s most prestigious universities had effected on me some &ldquo;side effects&rdquo; so to speak.&nbsp; I became complacent because I had the impression that once one becomes an Atenean, a good future is guaranteed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one personal &ldquo;truth&rdquo; which I&rsquo;m pretty sure attained universal status, because I think most Ateneans used to or worse, still think this way.&nbsp; However, studying in the Ateneo does not ensure one of a stable future.&nbsp; In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t give a person anything except the bragging right of being able to call oneself an &ldquo;Atenean.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then being labeled an Atenean does not automatically define a person, despite the stereotype (that Ateneans are eloquent, intelligent, etc.), because it is through one&rsquo;s individual character that he will be judged.&nbsp; Studying in the Ateneo is a privilege and each student must maximize this and hone his skills in order to truly embody the stereotype of what an Atenean ought to and is expected to be.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be very fulfilling for me, for example, if people would recognize that I am an Atenean not because I&rsquo;m wearing an Ateneo jacket or ID strap but because of the way I act or speak or write.&nbsp; If through my demeanor, I am recognized to be an Atenean, then the label of being one is not anymore constrained to the logo on the jacket, but rather, the label would be as if it were innately embedded on my forehead, visible wherever I go &ndash; and that would be a true mark of excellence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, it is noticeable that the concept of excellence has evolved from one of a purely academic nature into one that is deeper and more mature.&nbsp; This evolution, ironically, springs from the innovation of my character.&nbsp; I say it is ironic because in the first part, tradition and innovation were opposite poles creating a tension, but now, it has started to evolve into something else.&nbsp; As I am constantly being pushed and pulled in this tug-of-war, making me a seemingly passive object, I gradually transform into an active participant because I also attempt to pull these two poles together, and this essentially sums up what I am as an Atenean.&nbsp; Ultimately, my being an Atenean is my personal struggle to transform the tension between the tradition of excellence and the innovation of character into a wonderful juxtaposition that brings out the best of both sides...and hopefully, the best of who I am.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it would be very cool if I could do that."

"event","*published for Katipunan magazine&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Freshmen Orientation Seminar (ORSEM) can either be a very memorable or a very forgettable 3-day event.&nbsp; Held every year during the week before classes officially begin, freshmen either see it as an unnecessary requirement of going to school early, or a productive introduction for what&rsquo;s in store for them in the next four years. It has gone a long, long way since its inception when there was more grass than buildings in the college area, and the number of people in the covered courts was less than half of number now.&nbsp; And this year, aside from the whopping increase in the student population, the ORSEM itself has undergone drastic changes that brought shockwaves to the ORSEM committee, its volunteers, and even the alumni.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three major events highlight the 3 ORSEM days: the departmental talks, the campus tours, and the organization tours (orgtours).&nbsp; These have always been the core agenda for the freshmen up until four years ago when the School of Management (SOM) first held the SOM Night, which became an additional major event for the SOM students. Betsy Grozman, a present psychology professor and an Ateneo alumna, stated that in the early 90s (she didn&rsquo;t say what year exactly so as not to divulge her age), the freshmen batch comprised of approximately only 800 students, orgs could be easily counted and memorized and buildings such as SEC, CTC, and SOM were &ldquo;nothing but grass, grass, grass.&rdquo; Jose Ma. Edito Tirol, a present history professor and an Ateneo alumnus as well (freshmen batch 1990), stated the same except that he didn&rsquo;t remember anything about the orgtours because he thought of it as a &ldquo;waste of time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, with relatively fewer people, fewer orgs, and fewer buildings, finding out that they never ran during the campus and org tours was not surprising at all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as the years passed by, student population grew immensely from formerly having only the School of Arts and Sciences and one dean for everyone, to presently having four different schools, and four different deans.&nbsp; Also, a lot of student organizations were accredited in the last 15 years, and new buildings were also erected.&nbsp; Consequently, the ORSEM evolved into a much busier event with numerous stops for the campus and org tours, and with lots of upperclassmen volunteers making sure each block gets to each stop, spends equal time at it, and gets the necessary information.&nbsp; 

Hence, the running &ndash; which everyone seems to make a big fuss about.

Has the ideally fun, efficient, productive ORSEM indeed become a tiring, ineffective, waste of time?

Apparently, lots of parents and students think so.&nbsp; The administration has, in the last few years, received complaints of how tiring and ineffective the ORSEM was.&nbsp; And in parallel to that, the administration thinks that the ORSEM does not effectively give the freshmen an insight of the values held so dear primarily because the freshmen become so exhausted from running and they don&rsquo;t remember the details well because of the information overload they get.

In this context, the admin acts this year by effecting big, big changes.

In an interview with Mrs. Assunta Cuyegkeng, VP for the Loyola Schools, who speaks in behalf of the administration, she explained the major changes they proposed to the ORSEM committee, and the rationale behind them:

1. To decongest the ORSEM &ndash; The freshmen don&rsquo;t need to know everything about Ateneo in 3 days.&nbsp; For example, how effective is it to talk about Ignatian spirituality to 2100 freshmen for a few minutes? This is a very important topic that merits a more focused approach, one that creates a deeper impact.&nbsp; Another example is the effectivity of visiting 40-plus org booths in 2 hours, with some of the orgs promoting the stuff of their sponsors on the side. The admin puts value on the non-academic formation of our students through the orgs, but would it not be better to have more focus through cluster presentations in the various AVRs?

2. To shorten the hours &ndash; The admin thinks that the registration need not start at 6:30am because it will mean that some people have to leave their houses very early and stay till late in the afternoon. Admin suggested that some of the sessions be incorporated on other occasions such as InTACT, Org Recruitment week, etc.

3. To think about how their actions will reflect on the values of Ateneo - Perhaps, to teach them on their first days, that they are responsible for doing certain things by themselves and not depend on others: segregating their was waste, throwing garbage in the right places, etc. Or perhaps&mdash;because we seek the truth-- to tell true stories instead of urban legends.
Other minor changes were also proposed.&nbsp; The JGSOM freshmen were always asked to wear green on their first day for the past several years, and in the context of the Ateneo-La Salle rivalry, the dean of the SOM asked the ORSEM committee to choose another color.&nbsp; It must be noted, though, that SOSE students wore green.&nbsp; Another change proposed is that the bullhorn sirens be removed and instead be replaced with the synchronization of the chimes.&nbsp; The admin thinks that the sirens sound like alarm sirens so it would be difficult to distinguish when a real emergency occurs.&nbsp; However, this proposed change did not take effect and the sirens were still used like before.&nbsp; 

And so the ORSEM pushed through with Day 1 and Day 2 having the core agenda (dept talks and campus tours) those days were originally planned with.&nbsp; But come June 15, the biggest impact of the administration&rsquo;s suggestions for changes took place, and its impact was greatly felt.

Instead of the usual org tours held at the SEC building, the freshmen were instead put in the 8 different venues namely Escaler, Sec Lec B, Sec Lec C, CTC 105, the Ching Tan Room, Faura AVR, the Soc Sci AVR, and the Bell AVR.&nbsp; Instead of the freshmen going from room to room to view the different presentations of every organization, the organizations were grouped into clusters and were made to present in every venue.&nbsp; 

This was definitely a drastic change.&nbsp; 

But was the change a counter-culture approach to an event that was long since established and already considered tradition?&nbsp; Or was it a necessary enhancement of a culture that is great but could be greater?

A freshman from AB Interdisciplinary Studies commented that, &ldquo;it was a relief not to run around like they did the day before (campus tours).&rdquo;&nbsp; But then another freshman from BS Legal Management stated that &ldquo;it was better to run around than stay in the covered courts and then suddenly go to an aircon but &lsquo;boring&rsquo; venue&rsquo; because at least he wouldn&rsquo;t get sick and wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep.&rdquo;

And so it all boils down to a matter of perspective.

This year is the first time that the org tours were replaced with &ldquo;orgtalks&rdquo; and the effectivity of which cannot be easily judged.
Yes, the freshmen didn&rsquo;t have to run.&nbsp; Yes, they weren&rsquo;t tired.&nbsp; Yes, they weren&rsquo;t forced to digest an overload of information in such a short time.&nbsp; But the trade-offs of these cannot be easily disregarded too.&nbsp; For one, with 2100 freshmen this year being fit into the 8 AVRs made it inevitable that they become like sardines forced to fit in a can.&nbsp; There simply isn&rsquo;t enough room.&nbsp;
 Monoblock chairs were put on the aisles, front, and back parts of the AVRs to accommodate all the freshmen, the ORSEM volunteers sat on the floor, and the other clusters waiting for their turn to present had to wait outside.&nbsp; Also, the orgs are forced to unite with their fellow orgs in their respective cluster, thereby making creativity of presentation limited because of the limited time per cluster.&nbsp; And furthermore, a lot of freshmen on Day 3 this year seem to view the org presentations as a comfortable venue for them to rest and fall asleep.

And so, the counter-culture and culture enhancement view on the change depends on who reacts to it.&nbsp; And the judgment of the pros and cons of it lies on the compromise of the admin and the ORSEM committee.

Given the whopping increase in student population every year, would the ORSEM next year stick with the new orgtalks now or would they go back to the traditional orgtours?&nbsp; 

The evaluation of the change is yet to be done, and the effect of which is yet to be seen.&nbsp; We all just have to wait and see for next year&hellip;."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was already the wee hours of the morning of April 3, and I was still up, chatting with friends on the Internet.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why, but for some reason, a friend and I were talking about wakes and funerals.&nbsp; We were going on about where we would want our wake to be, what song would be playing in the background, who we think would actually visit, who we think would deliver a eulogy for us.&nbsp; It was a long conversation revolving around ourselves individually and how we wanted to be remembered, but in the end we came up with an agreed upon insight.&nbsp; We agreed that we would be eternally touched and grateful if someone we least expect to speak, goes up the podium, reaches for the microphone, and delivers some kind words about us.&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful to know that unknowingly, we have touched someone&rsquo;s life?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right after I pressed the enter key to end that statement, my cell phone rang, and I got news that a high school batch mate of mine shot himself in the head just a couple of minutes ago.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words cannot express what I was feeling.&nbsp; Shock, disbelief, bewilderment - all battling inside me.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t be true, it just can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It was my best friend who called me, and well, we&rsquo;ve had a history of pulling pranks on each other, so even after she said it, I still left room for the possibility that it was not so.&nbsp; But it was true.&nbsp; Eddie was dead, and we all had to accept it however difficult it may be.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was very difficult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late into the morning, my best friend started spreading the news of Eddie&rsquo;s death thru text.&nbsp; They were close family friends, and that was the task designated to her.&nbsp; It was a simple text informing the recipients of his passing, details of the wake, and a request for prayers for the family he left behind.&nbsp; His mother was already a widow, his brother blamed himself totally because the gun that Eddie used was his.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Times are always hard when a family member dies, but given the circumstances, Eddie&rsquo;s death made it infinitely harder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eddie wasn&rsquo;t the kind in high school who went up the stage during recognition to receive an academic award, wasn&rsquo;t a jock, and was pretty inactive in extra-curricular activities.&nbsp; He made a couple of imprudent decisions, took a vice or two, repeated junior year.&nbsp; From what I hear from my best friend, he wasn&rsquo;t really close to his family either.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t perfect&hellip;just like each and every one of us. <br /><br /><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even know Eddie that well.&nbsp; He was just an acquaintance, an ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s kabarkada in the old days, a family friend of my best friend, a familiar face I used to see everyday along the hallways of our high school.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t explain it, but for some reason, I am greatly affected and bothered by his death.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s the manner by which he died, maybe it&rsquo;s the mystery behind it (he didn&rsquo;t leave a note), or maybe just the waste of life.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shouldn&rsquo;t have died.&nbsp; He shouldn&rsquo;t have died.&nbsp; He shouldn&rsquo;t have died.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I think over and over again.&nbsp; No one that young should die.&nbsp; He has only lived a quarter of his life, not even reaching his prime.&nbsp; He should be in college, doing what me and our other batchmates are doing: living life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But life&rsquo;s not fair.&nbsp; We should deal with it with acceptance, not bitterness &ndash; a friend told me that, and she&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Eddie&rsquo;s dying wasn&rsquo;t fair to his family, to his friends, and even to him, but there are things that are beyond our control and we should accept that.&nbsp; As the priests say, &ldquo;we should see death for what it really is: the end of poverty and the beginning of riches, the end of fear and the beginning of tranquility, the end of pain and the beginning of strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; About remembering Eddie: we should remember him not because of the list of his imperfections, but because of all the beautiful years he shared with the people around him.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t the perfect student, but he was a thoughtful and caring friend.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t really close to his family, but he loved them and they loved him greatly in return; closeness is a relative term anyway, while love, absolute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One last thing. Why was I up at past 2am last April 3?&nbsp; Why was I chatting?&nbsp; Why was that particular weird friend who asks weird questions online, too?&nbsp; Why were we talking about funerals of all the other weird things to talk about?&nbsp; Why did my best friend call the second after I pressed the enter key?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s weird, really weird, but somehow, at the same time, equally enlightening.&nbsp; Now, exactly 2 weeks after his death, I suddenly have an epiphany&hellip;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we were talking about funerals, my friend and I came up with our insight.&nbsp; And because of that insight, I&rsquo;m writing this essay.&nbsp; I probably am the most unexpected person to speak about him, but somehow, I feel I owe this to Eddie.<br />"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I want to do some thinking, I always find myself driving. Driving for miles and miles with no clear set destination. Driving really fast, driving really slow, depending on my mood, depending on circumstance. And no matter where my aimless wandering begins, I always end up in the Fort. It&rsquo;s not a place of grandeur; its not even home. So why do I wind up there? This is why: there are places we all come back to &ndash; sentimental places &ndash; because they helped make who we are now. And even if we&rsquo;re all grown up, feigning maturity and wisdom, we will always come back, like a child in search of comfort. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a senior in high school when the Gonuts Donuts in the Fort, its pioneer branch, first opened. I just got my own car then, and being always eager to drive, I'd often take my friends to get some donuts before going back to school, 5 minutes away. The staff then, very grateful that we frequented their isolated place, always asked us to tell everyone about their haven of soft luscious donuts. It seems so long ago, especially now seeing different branches of Gonuts Donuts, and always full of people.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its also the place where I practiced driving. Those were the days when encountering an intersection seemed like the end of the world. I&rsquo;d shiver with fear and pray that it wouldnt be my last day. Seriously. But now? I&rsquo;m willing to drive all the way to tagaytay on any given day, driving really really REALLY fast, with time acting as pressure and intersections...what intersections? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its also the place I meet my closest friends at. Since all of my friends inconveniently (for me) live in the south, Makati's the middle ground, and our regular place to rendezvous.&nbsp; And since I hate Makati, as in Makati CBD per se with all its one-ways, and no-left-turns, and no u-turns, and what-not, we always meet up in the Fort. In Starbucks. In UCC. Wherever. So that we could catch up on things, catch up on what&rsquo;s happening in our lives, lives that at one point in time were so inseparable, and now have inevitably drifted apart.&nbsp; But come to think of it...Fort's not even Makati in truth is it? It&rsquo;s in Taguig. Not many people recognize that but yeah, the Forts part of Taguig not Makati. But so much about being politically accurate, right? It looks extremely Makati-ish anyway.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also the place an ex boyfriend and I always hung out in. It was the place where we had most of our dates in. The place where we had the fondest times. I can associate every nick and corner there with some memory of him.&nbsp; And ironically, it&rsquo;s also the place where we argued; whenever there&rsquo;s a fight coming up, we would park at a parking lot in the Fort and there we would argue, sometimes shout at each other, and when things get really bad, that was where we would part ways.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A venue for fostering friendship. A place that elevates status from &quot;just friends&quot; to &quot;more than friends&quot;. And also, sadly, the host to &quot;more than friends&quot; becoming &quot;just friends&quot; again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are places we go back to. At times we take it for granted, to our detriment. At times we simply forget about it, turning our backs on it at the risk of self-contempt. But people don&rsquo;t go on like that for long because there would really come a time when we would NEED to go back to this place. We would come back not to endure nostalgia, not to relive a moment passed, not to attempt to recover or repair old issues, good heavens no. We come back to sanctify memory. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And well, sometimes remembering does us a lot of good. Especially when our mind's a mess and we&rsquo;re driving around, trying to fix it."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people agree with Nick Joaquin, many people don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I know he&rsquo;s not entirely accurate with everything he says and writes, but we have to admit that he has a point &ndash; a big point.&nbsp; I am a frustrated writer so I&rsquo;m very appreciative of good books and essays, and I love Nick Joaquin&rsquo;s choice of words.&nbsp; In fact, as I was going around the Metropolitan museum, looking at the rows and rows of pottery and thinking to myself, &ldquo;So what the hell is so special about these pots?&nbsp; God, they&rsquo;re ugly,&rdquo; his words were ringing in my head &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip;we feel equal to materials that yield but evade the challenge of materials that resist&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; and right you are, Mr. Nick.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Culture is always a touchy subject for us Filipinos because we cannot, as a people, agree on what defines &ldquo;Filipino culture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some say the Spaniards stole it when they came, some say the Spaniards improved it, and some say we didn&rsquo;t have a culture prior to Spain&rsquo;s coming and that Spanish influence and how we adapted to it is our culture.&nbsp; But oh well, regardless of what is correct, more importantly, the essential thing is the now; What is our edge over other cultures now?&nbsp; What makes us truly Filipino now?&nbsp; That we&nbsp; had, still have, and will always have the ability to make pots?&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp; Figuratively and literally, are we not capable of making something bigger and nicer?&nbsp; Are we just being humble?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; And as Mr. Joaquin says, &ldquo;Are we not confusing timidity for humility and making a virtue of what may be the worst of our vices?&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the ugly clay pots our forefathers made sit in a museum located in our Central Bank.&nbsp; Does these things really merit national treasure security?&nbsp; Oh what low standards we have, then.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I may seem harsh, unpatriotic even, maybe the pots have a deeper story behind&nbsp; them, maybe they are indeed worth a lot, but for me (an average 19 year old college student), they&rsquo;re just ugly old pots.&nbsp; And that says a lot about our culture.&nbsp; In my opinion, beauty and size matter in the measure of a culture&rsquo;s greatness, and if an ordinary 19 year old student like me (and most of classmates I&rsquo;m sure) doesn&rsquo;t find a certain legacy of our own country pretty, then there must be a problem.&nbsp; All Italians find Michaelangelo&rsquo;s David impressive, all Russians say &ldquo;wow&rdquo; to Tolstoy&rsquo;s Anna Karenina.&nbsp; But Filipinos regarding pots?&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t say wow, most of us say &ldquo;Ngyek ano ba yan?&rdquo;&nbsp; I know we have other things to be proud of like paintings, and the gold collection, but I just can&rsquo;t seem to get over the pots.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, in the National Museum, I was slightly impressed with the balanghay (not sure of spelling, but it&rsquo;s the big boat on display).&nbsp; When I saw it, I thought to myself, &ldquo;Nice boat, I wonder what our ship looks like.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I realized that there was no ship because that already was the ship.&nbsp; In our pre-colonial times, while the Spaniards, Portugese, Dutch, and English were busy with their big ships roaming around the world in search of the unknown, we were busy with our balanghays going from island to island just within our small archipelago, sometimes to trade and sometimes to fight with the other kingdoms (although there are some accounts of a few Filipinos on balanghays going to China I think, but that&rsquo;s insignificant).&nbsp; And so Nick Joaquin strikes again, we could have been a great society if there had not been a &ldquo;fatal aversion to synthesis.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just how we were then and how we still are now: we love small because we don&rsquo;t think we can handle anything big.&nbsp; Anything big intimidates us like hell and unfortunately, we&rsquo;re too scared to even try.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the bottom line: we&rsquo;re scared.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t we progress after mastering the art of making pots?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t we move on to glass or stone?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t we build bigger ships?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t we venture beyond the sea?&nbsp; Because we were scared.&nbsp; We deceive ourselves by thinking it&rsquo;s impossible and so we stick within our comfortable zone, thereby making us stagnant.&nbsp; Then in the long run, as the population swells (there are other factors besides population of course) and our problems multiply, given that our effort remains small, we find ourselves incapable of doing even the smallest of things.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; It sucks to think that we were that way before.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s suckier is the thought that until now, we are still that way.&nbsp; We are mediocrity personified; for us mediocrity is bliss."

"event","I concede, as I type the first few words of my essay on melancholy &ndash; sheer melancholy.&nbsp; Every night it somehow manages to creep deep inside my consciousness, completely paralyzing all other thoughts except those that are of the same nature.&nbsp; It takes full control of my mind, and gives birth to thoughts and emotions that are its kin like paranoia, insecurity, hopelessness.&nbsp;

 Rhetorical questions flood in and I am caught in awe at all the ideas that arise because of this, and the fact that no matter how hard I try, I can never answer them.&nbsp; I can only formulate hunches, mere guesses, but ultimately, I will never know for sure.&nbsp; There is no escape from this torture and the only way out is admitting defeat; its victory is assured even before the challenge is posed.&nbsp; And every night, though its strategy of attack varies, I always concede.&nbsp; I am dumbstruck, incapable of moving, of fighting.&nbsp; It somehow comforts me to know I fought a good fight, but in the end I always offer my concession.&nbsp; And now once again, melancholy has visited me and has assailed me, hitting me where I am most weak &ndash; the heart.&nbsp; And now once again, I admit my defeat.&nbsp; Now once again, I concede.

It certainly is a mystery why we&rsquo;re together.&nbsp; We are oh so different from each other, always at opposite ends of the river, and for the longest time, no one has ever dared cross the bridge.&nbsp; I get exhausted from always standing on the edge, shouting so loud in the hope that the message will come across, and somehow reach him.&nbsp; And maybe this [exhaustion] is the cause of melancholy&rsquo;s nightly visits.&nbsp; I am sad because of the state we are in, being on opposite ends.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t we just be on the same side?&nbsp; Or maybe we could meet up in the bridge, the middle ground.&nbsp; Or maybe he can just cross over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hoping he&rsquo;ll accept the fact that I am on side A, and I intend to stay there, while he being on side B will cross over.&nbsp; Fat chance.&nbsp; We both know what we want; the problem is we don&rsquo;t want the same things.&nbsp; Bummer.&nbsp; Someone has to give in.

And now, I&rsquo;ve decided to give in; last night&rsquo;s melancholy was the worst.&nbsp; I am not the kind of person who thinks long term.&nbsp; I live for the present; I appreciate every moment.&nbsp; Planning ahead is a waste of time because it eats precious minutes or sometimes hours that should instead be spent happily for the present.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s just my bullshit.&nbsp; My real reason for not thinking long term is that it scares me.&nbsp; Yes, it scares the hell out of me.&nbsp; What if things won&rsquo;t turn out the way I expect them to?&nbsp; What if I thought wrong?&nbsp; What if the ending does not occur in line with the happy ending I imagined?&nbsp; What if I fuck up?&nbsp; And what if the only reason why things don&rsquo;t end up happily is because I fuck up?&nbsp; And the litany goes on.

I&rsquo;m perfectly fine with the idea that I only see him every Sunday.&nbsp; Is the feeling actually normal?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t smoke when I&rsquo;m with him.&nbsp; God, I know I sound so selfish and stupid defending a vice and escaping my boyfriend at the same time.&nbsp; But hear me out, it&rsquo;s not just that.&nbsp; I feel so choked, so limited, so incarcerated when I&rsquo;m with him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Wear your seatbelt.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drive too fast.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t smoke when you&rsquo;re with me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You curse too much.&rdquo;

And the litany goes on&hellip;but despite the fact that I&rsquo;m a person who does everything I want when possible, I concede and follow him.&nbsp; Partly it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want to put up a fight, partly because I&rsquo;m too lazy to refuse, and partly because he&rsquo;s actually right.&nbsp; Any person watching us from afar would readily say that he&rsquo;s got the upper hand.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s right, no doubt about that.
But then it&rsquo;s fun to be wrong.

It&rsquo;s fun to drive without a seatbelt; those things are so uncomfortable.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fun to drive fast; living life on the fast lane, baby.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fun to smoke; you can see the stress rising up to heaven in the form of smoke.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fun to curse; putang ina.

And yet, I still concede.&nbsp; Tonight, with melancholy as the singular catalyst, I&rsquo;ve reached the height of my concession.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m experiencing a quarter life crisis like Chip, but tonight, all of a sudden, I&rsquo;ve decided to give in.

Yes being wrong is fun while it lasts, but afterwards, the stupidity of it all sinks in and creates a splash of melancholy.&nbsp; Woooosh.&nbsp; And then I start to fashion ideas in my mind &ndash; ideas that completely paralyze all other thoughts except that of its kin.
We rarely agree.
We always fight.
Is this healthy?
Is this relationship actually going anywhere?
I wonder how long it will last...
Oh shit, I&rsquo;m thinking of the long run.&nbsp; Help, help, I&rsquo;m scared.

But then screw the fear.&nbsp; Yes almighty fear, you win and I lose.&nbsp; Now as I sigh my sigh of resignation, I concede.&nbsp; The only thing missing is a pat on my back.&nbsp; Yes, I lose but I&rsquo;m not one who wallows in defeat.&nbsp; Yes I lose, and I&rsquo;m doing it gloriously.&nbsp; If he goes with us to Batangas, I swear I won&rsquo;t smoke.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t even drink too much.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s actually okay.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll just be one long Sunday, one long day in incarceration, but not being less happy than that when I&rsquo;m free. Yes, being happy in jail is possible.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it ironic?&nbsp; I may be a hard headed, narrow-minded person, but I do know how to value things that matter most.&nbsp; And he matters most, no doubt about that."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I was 14 years old when I first heard the word holocaust.&nbsp; My mom and I were in Amsterdam and of course, we visited the house of Anne Frank.&nbsp; I even remember cursing every 5 minutes or so because all the staircases (there were a lot) were abnormally steep.&nbsp; We even had to walk through this little hidden door to get into the attic where she hid for more than 2 years.&nbsp; Hassle.&nbsp; And being a young and stupid girl, all I thought of was, &ldquo;Who the hell was the architect of this house?&nbsp; He should be burning in hell now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyway because of that, you could imagine how much of the tour guide&rsquo;s lecture got stuck in my brain: close to none.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I grew older however, I got to learn a little more info regarding the matter (Sir, you are welcome to correct any errors because this is all stock knowledge).&nbsp; I got to know the city most devastated in the Second World War: Warsaw, Poland.&nbsp; I know the country that suffered the greatest loss of life: the USSR.&nbsp; I know the number of deaths: A LOT (a little over 30 million?).&nbsp; I know, even if vaguely, the details of the war: the dates, the people involved, the start and end etc.&nbsp; I know the horrible facts and figures, and these trigger various emotions, opinions, and judgments from different people, but ultimately I guess it just baffles us.&nbsp; We try our best to comprehend the war, the atrocity, the cause, and we use statistics to help us understand the history.&nbsp; But then now, almost 60 years after it all happened, even the statistics seem illogical.&nbsp; Take 6 million for example &ndash; that single statistic of the murdered European Jews is certainly the most irrational, simply the hardest to grasp.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitler wanted to create a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; race.&nbsp; Consequently, everything and everyone he deemed flawed, he killed.&nbsp; Jews were the scum of the earth in his eyes, hence, his fervent desire to &ldquo;cleanse&rdquo; Europe of this impurity.&nbsp; And so being Fuhrer, he called on the annihilation of the Jews.&nbsp; No other people was chosen for total extermination.&nbsp; No other people was victim of such irrationality.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what makes the 6M so special.&nbsp; The other 24 million deaths, in contrast, were mere casualties.&nbsp; Casualty by definition is somebody whose death was an indirect result of grave circumstances, in this case, war.&nbsp; The deaths of the Jews were certainly not.&nbsp; On the contrary, their deaths couldn&rsquo;t have been more direct.&nbsp; For Hitler, it was only when all the Jews&rsquo; lives have ended that the war itself will end.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why he kept on killing Jews despite Germany&rsquo;s defeat being evident.&nbsp; We all know it was a double-edged war with one side portraying political intentions, ergo the need to prove military supremacy, while the other side being rooted in racial concerns, ergo the need to maintain the Aryans&rsquo; firm hold of the apex in the racial hierarchy --- those are the boring facts I have accumulated.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even know if what I know is indeed accurate but I don&rsquo;t really care because given that we know all the objective facts and figures of the war and the Anti-Semitic extermination, does this equate full comprehension of the tragedy?&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp; No, because we know the whole thing runs a lot deeper. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we see that statistics isn&rsquo;t enough to understand history.&nbsp; It is only when we give it a human face that we see things more clearly.&nbsp; And in this case, the face is purely Jewish.&nbsp; World War II was about many things, but it was mainly about one very stupid thing &ndash; Hitler&rsquo;s Operation Kill All Jews.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; One great thing the Jews did was to write things down.&nbsp; Now we have the privilege of reading things like the Diary of Anne Frank (stupid staircases), the diary of Wladyslaw Szpilman, which I am currently reading now (popularly known as the book and movie entitled The Pianist), and of course The Last Days documentary.&nbsp; In the continuum of time, the present is retained in a small measure called moments, which is akin to taking a photograph &ndash; one click and its gone &ndash; forever out of our grasp into the abyss called memory.&nbsp; The memoirs the Jews wrote down serve as a tangible documentation of the tragic moments they had to endure.&nbsp; Now their memories are not only exclusive to themselves and their families, but to the whole world.&nbsp; They did a very humanitarian act if you ask me.&nbsp; Now, long after their death, we have a glimpse of what really transpired in the holocaust 60 years ago.&nbsp; We now can learn and try to interpret the past.&nbsp; And though the whole objective truth can never be reached because of conscious or unconscious bias in the evidence or because of human shortcomings maybe in recording and observing, this is the closest we can get to it.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s good enough if you ask me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; In The Last Days, through the memoirs, we see a lot of things obtaining clarity.&nbsp; One is the evident tyranny of tradition on the Germans&rsquo; part.&nbsp; In the footages we see them being controlled by old fears and moreover, hatred to the Jews.&nbsp; We see the spiral effect of the hatred manifested as they gradually deprived the Jews of their rights, property, and livelihood.&nbsp; We also see the next step as the Jews were segregated and ostracized in society by making them live in ghettos, deprived even from the protection of the law.&nbsp; And then we also see in the documentary the situation as the Jews were finally put in those horrible concentration camps.&nbsp; Because of this hatred, unconscious habits and actions had arisen.&nbsp; The Germans, totally brainwashed by Hitler maybe, thought that they were doing the right thing, that the cruelty on the Jews was justified by the cleansing-the-world paradigm.&nbsp; God, were they self-centered pricks all caught up in a belief so wrong, an ideology so fatal.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the second point: the wrongness of an ideology.&nbsp; We see the stupidity of the idea of a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; race because we know that there is no such thing.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s beside the point.&nbsp; If Hitler thought the Aryans were the only pure race, then there is nothing wrong with that; he is entitled to his own opinion.&nbsp; The problem is that because of the belief, he sought the need to completely put the Jews into extinction.&nbsp; No one has the right to do that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see in the documentary the 5 lucky survivors retelling and reliving the traumatic memories they have.&nbsp; We see the effects of the stupid ideology and how their supposed impurity was concretized.&nbsp; We see them branded with the yellow star always on their chest, discriminated by their non-Jew neighbors who used to be their closest friends.&nbsp; In short, we see the Jews robbed of&hellip;Life.&nbsp; And they couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it at all.&nbsp; Hitler was god and he sentenced the Jews to a punishment graver than hell &ndash; all because he was so caught up in his hatred and was engrossed with his false ideology.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the tyranny of tradition and the wrongness of an ideology concretized in the memories the survivors shared make us realize just how human &ldquo;great&rdquo; people like Hitler are.&nbsp; We see the capacity of man for good &amp; evil.&nbsp; And so we see the symbiosis of history &amp; humanity.&nbsp; We recognize history not only as an academic discipline, but an aspect in life that all people have a role in.&nbsp; We see in the film how the world was 60 years ago, and all the good and bad things that came with it.&nbsp; We then study this specific part of the past, analyzing the details, interpreting them, in the hope that we could truly understand.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the point?&nbsp; Well, as you said, sir, &ldquo;To ignore the errors of the past is to condone it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then it isn&rsquo;t enough, is it?&nbsp; We know that it&rsquo;s not so much the details or statistics that matter, but the values that are imparted through the course of time, and the effect the great tragedy has on human kind.&nbsp; A lot of people died, do we find someone to blame or do we ponder what should be done now and how the past could be used to create a brighter future?&nbsp; That is the essence of the 5 survivors&rsquo; memories, and memory per se for that matter.&nbsp; It is the key to the past &ndash; good or bad &ndash; which gives the unlimited potential of the future.&nbsp; In other words, though memory ignites despair or anguish as in the case of the holocaust, more importantly, it ignites hope.&nbsp; And the symbiosis of memory and hope serves as a guiding light in our venture to the future unknown. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; To illustrate further: one of the 5 Hungarian Jews in The Last Days was Renee.&nbsp; She was the one who wore her bathing suit under her clothes on her first day at Auschwitz.&nbsp; The bathing suit brought back the good days before the German occupation.&nbsp; It brought back the laughter, the security, the love she once felt.&nbsp; Although the feeling stayed with her for only a short while, it served its purpose: it was her sole source of hope.&nbsp; Renee never lost hope that maybe someday the sun will shine again and life will be good again.&nbsp; And it did, the sun did shine again, maybe not as brightly as before &ndash; because it will never be &ndash; but at least there is light in her life again.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next in line, we have Irene.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the one who swallowed the diamonds her mom gave her.&nbsp; Now this is one tough girl.&nbsp; She vowed never to become ash like the thousands around her.&nbsp; Her mommy gave her diamonds to buy bread and that was what she intended to do.&nbsp; She did everything just so that no German will lay a hand on her precious stones.&nbsp; She strived to stay alive for the diamonds and she succeeded.&nbsp; Now, the stones are an heirloom passed down from generation to generation as a symbol of heredity, a memory of the reason for life.&nbsp; Now the grandkids can say, &ldquo;It is because of these diamonds that we are in this world today.&rdquo;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other tale that touched me the most was Rob&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He is the guy that when en route to America talked to an American soldier who said, &ldquo;Man, have all the damn bananas and oranges you can eat.&rdquo;&nbsp; That I found really funny and enlightening at the same time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a manifestation of life renewed, life suddenly surging through his veins after such a long time of its absence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it funny that when things are really bad, we humans can find a driving force to live in such a simple thing like a bathing suit?&nbsp; That life can continue because of a couple of diamonds?&nbsp; That oranges and bananas can be luxurious, even divine?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by giving history a human face do we best understand these things and life itself for that matter.&nbsp; Now, we comprehend that every human being is infinitely valuable with infinite potential.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Renee, Irene, and Rob have kids and grandkids who now are bursting with life, living up their dreams.&nbsp; Those lucky descendants are the products of memory and hope: memory being the foundation, hope the catalyst, and they are the outcome.&nbsp; The memory of death served as the key to life, with hope speeding up the process.&nbsp; But imagine if Renee, Irene, and Rob died.&nbsp; What a total waste of potential.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, 60 years after it all happened, the holocaust may still seem hard to grasp.&nbsp; But at least it isn&rsquo;t a complete mystery anymore.&nbsp; Our attempt to understand the past, sans futile ill emotions and blame, gives us the key to brighter future.&nbsp; Now we can be on guard against things like the tyranny of tradition and wrong ideologies because we are already aware of how stories with these components will most likely end.&nbsp; Personally, we can now realize how stupid the whole issue of race is because after all, we all belong to one race, and that is the human race. We realize further the need to accept and not just tolerate the people we deem different from us; when will we learn to see through the eyes of others?&nbsp; It has been said that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it; I say those who do not learn from history are simply doomed.&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you drive along C5 or Edsa or any main road for that matter, you would most probably notice two kinds of relatively new sedans that are, for lack of better term, abundant.&nbsp; They are the Honda City (the car with chinito lights), and the Chevrolet Optra.&nbsp; And when you do see an Optra and it happens to be white, chances are it&rsquo;s me you see, because there are only a few people in this world who, like me, are compelled by parental parameters to get the cheapest car, ergo base model, ergo only available in white and gold in Chevy&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; Naturally I chose white coz I&rsquo;d rather look like a taxi than a coffin on wheels.&nbsp; Anyway, if you look closer at the white Chevy you see and you notice that it doesn&rsquo;t have an emblem at the back, well congratulations, you&rsquo;ve just encountered my car&hellip;and in a sense, you&rsquo;ve encountered me as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First class is at 930.&nbsp; At 910, I&rsquo;m still at home, inside my car, revving up the engine, listening to it howl.&nbsp; For about 5 minutes I&rsquo;m just sitting there so engrossed in introspection; I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;Do I have my I.D. with me?&nbsp; My cell phone?&nbsp; Smokes?&nbsp; A pen?&nbsp; Oh screw the pen, I&rsquo;ll just borrow one from Anna.&nbsp; Do I have my law book?&nbsp; My Accounting homework?&nbsp; I know I did the damn thing last night, but is it in my bag now?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the litany goes on.&nbsp; You see, I&rsquo;m not exactly an organized person so as the car needs a few minutes to warm up, I too need a few minutes to think.&nbsp; For a while I thought I had OCD because I&rsquo;m always paranoid thinking I forgot something and consequently overly check.&nbsp; But then again I guess my being disorganized and having poor memory is enough justification, huh?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 915 I&rsquo;m finally on the road.&nbsp; Shift into first gear and then second and then third, before I know it I&rsquo;m on fifth going on a steady speed of about 90 kph until I get passed the tunnel and into Katipunan where I can actually go 120.&nbsp; Chipeco says I drive like a maniac, I tell him to shut up.&nbsp; Traffic lights and speed limits are mere suggestions if there are no policemen.&nbsp; The lack of road courtesy is pardoned when class starts in 15 minutes.&nbsp; Of course that&rsquo;s just me being backed up by my pretty fast 1.6 liter engine car.&nbsp; I know you would probably say that I should wake up earlier so I have more travel time and therefore afford to drive slowly.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve learned to do.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; something already learned.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s operant conditioning and the law of effect at its finest, where organisms learn the association between a behavior and a consequence.&nbsp; I know I can get to school in 15 minutes (reward), therefore I continue waking up late and taking it easy (behavior).&nbsp; And besides, I think my hippocampus, being the part of the brain that decides what to keep in the form of memory, deemed the way I drive now as the procedural memory of driving I will always retrieve.&nbsp; In short, this is the way I drive and I don&rsquo;t think I can ever change it unless extinction occurs maybe if I get into a big accident.&nbsp; Then I would have a post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp; But sans any near-death experience, I can&rsquo;t reboot my hippocampus. Haha. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time to talk about something serious.&nbsp; At some point in time a car will get bumped and consequently will suffer a dent.&nbsp; Dents are ugly to look at, a beautiful car deformed; it&rsquo;s just depressing.&nbsp; Well sometimes I get dented too in a sense.&nbsp; Catalysts for this include an emotional ordeal, something shallow like a low score on a big test, or something deep like thinking of the future.&nbsp; Sometimes at night I just become sad and can&rsquo;t exactly pin point why.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s weird, it&rsquo;s hard to explain.&nbsp; But sometimes melancholy somehow manages to creep deep inside my consciousness, completely paralyzing all other thoughts.&nbsp; It takes full control of my mind, and gives birth to thoughts and emotions that are its kin like paranoia, insecurity, hopelessness.&nbsp; Rhetorical questions flood in and I am caught in awe at all the ideas that arise, and the fact that no matter how hard I try, I can never answer them.&nbsp; I can only formulate hunches, mere guesses, but ultimately, I will never know for sure.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I hate thinking long term.&nbsp; It scares the hell out of me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I live for the present, having fun, finding my way as I go.&nbsp; But then fun is only fun while it lasts.&nbsp; Afterwards, the stupidity of it all sinks in and creates a splash of melancholia.&nbsp; Wooosh.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To illustrate further: the last 2 months of my recently concluded relationship was not good at all.&nbsp; And sometimes at night I found myself thinking, &ldquo;We rarely agree, we&rsquo;ve grown apart, is this healthy, is this relationship still going anywhere, I wonder how long it will last...&rdquo; And then I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Oh shit I&rsquo;m thinking long-term again, help, help, I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I stopped thinking.&nbsp; I convinced myself that maybe it will be better tomorrow.&nbsp; The shit is but a phase and it soon shall pass.&nbsp; And by doing that, I fixed the dent.&nbsp; The next day I was a brand new car again.&nbsp; Or so I thought.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t pass.&nbsp; Guess I should have faced the fear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what do I fear?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t fear thinking long-term per se.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m realizing that maybe, well psychologically speaking, I have the fear-of-fear thing, a mild one mind you.&nbsp; The only reason why I don&rsquo;t like thinking long-term is because I&rsquo;m scared of the scary things I might think of while thinking about it.&nbsp; Weird, huh?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like driving.&nbsp; Sometimes I don&rsquo;t even notice that I&rsquo;m over a hundred already.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not scared, I don&rsquo;t have a weak heart, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to suffer a stroke on the road.&nbsp; So you see, I don&rsquo;t fear speed per se.&nbsp; What I do fear are stupid pedestrians crossing C5 or maybe the big-ass trucks with poor brakes, and the accidents or deaths that will be caused by them and that will be aggravated by my driving speed.&nbsp; But I still drive fast anyway; I can&rsquo;t help it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you&rsquo;ll ask me to define life, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a lot like driving.&nbsp; And we all are cars or SUVs or trucks or whatever form of vehicle making our way through this big, big highway called life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an Optra &ndash; an ordinary white car with a not so dark tint, rain visors, and a missing emblem.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not an extravagant car, the color&rsquo;s plain too, but I never vied for luxury or fame anyway.&nbsp; Most of the time I&rsquo;m on the fast lane, shifting gears as circumstance necessitates.&nbsp; Sometimes I make the wrong decision and shift to the wrong gear, or sometimes I do something untimely making me shift too soon or too late.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them, right?&nbsp; There are times when some asshole bumps me and I get a dent so I have to go to the shoulder for a while to fix myself up.&nbsp; Sometimes I can do the fixing myself, but there are times that I need friends or a teacher or a parent to stop over and help me heal.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s great when those stop-overs happen because sometimes they don&rsquo;t just fix the dent, they give me an oil change or a car wash as well, and that makes me feel really better and I appreciate the people around me more.&nbsp; And then when I&rsquo;m like brand new again, I go back on the road, driving like I was before.&nbsp; Oftentimes, I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going, but that&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more fun to figure things out when you get there anyway.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s just me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll get a new car.&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;ll have an SUV for a change or a pick-up.&nbsp; Hmmm&hellip;"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like Batman.&nbsp; He is not cool, not superhero material.&nbsp; I mean, what&rsquo;s he got to brag about?&nbsp; Superman was from the planet Krypton, Spiderman got bit by a mysterious spider, the Hulk was a screwed-up chemical guinea pig (right?), the Fantastic Four got exposed to radiation.&nbsp; But Bruce Wayne?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s nothing but a rich kid with a quasi-good cause.&nbsp; He was out for revenge, helping others was just an added bonus.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just me though.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others actually find him appealing.&nbsp; Most people like the fact that he is perfectly human---no special traits whatsoever---but still capable of accomplishing extraordinary feats.&nbsp; Some like his costume, the mystery an all black outfit emanates maybe, bad fashion sense if you ask me.&nbsp; Capes are so unsafe for super heroes; they get caught in buildings, posts and what-not.&nbsp; Some people like the dark side he has, adds a dash of spice to his character, and that&rsquo;s what we are going to ponder upon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bruce Wayne did not have a happy concrete operational stage (approximately from 7-11 years old - Piaget).&nbsp; In other words, he had a sucky childhood.&nbsp; One time, he fell into a deep well that was full of&hellip;who would have guessed&hellip;bats.&nbsp; He was stuck there for quite a long time until his daddy came to rescue him.&nbsp; He was very close to his dad by the way.&nbsp; Then, not long after, his parents were robbed of and shot right in front of him.&nbsp; These two occurrences had a deep impact on his personality to say in the least.&nbsp; Obviously, these were traumatic experiences for him as proved in what will happen to him in the future.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll get to that later.&nbsp; Another effect on him was the biased classification of people he resorted to.&nbsp; In the concrete operation stage, classification skills are present, but abstract thinking is not yet developed.&nbsp; Ergo, thinking becomes operational, logical thinking without intuitive thought.&nbsp; In line with this, well using my amateur skills in psychoanalysis, I think young Bruce impulsively classified criminals unjustly; his schema became &ldquo;all criminals are bad&hellip;they killed my parents&hellip;they should die too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being an only child, he was really alone, with only Alfred as his companion.&nbsp; This led him to detach himself from reality in his formal operational stage (approx. 11 to 15 yrs old - Piaget).&nbsp; He then repressed his grief and concentrated more on &ldquo;solving&rdquo; his problem in a really idealistic manner, which is typical in this stage of life.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a nutshell, Bruce Wayne had everything anyone could wish for, and because of the untimely demise of his parents, all that came crashing down. But life went on and he faced the world, carrying the grief on his shoulders at the same time.&nbsp; Corollary to this, he developed an identity-versus-identity confusion. He was probably thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the same person I was before and will never be again, so what am I going to be now?&rdquo;&nbsp; Big dilemma that should have been.&nbsp; And since Bruce, whether in the comics or the movies, was never really known to have long-time girlfriends or best friends (save Alfred), I assume he developed an intimacy-versus-isolation disorder as well.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t want to be close to anybody anymore because he fears losing them; he fears getting hurt so much again.&nbsp; Lastly, in my opinion, he also acquired a renewed (since this already occurred at age 1-3) sense of autonomy.&nbsp; With the death of his parents, he was endowed with a new sense of independence and moreover, a new purpose in life.&nbsp; And since he was pretty rich and pretty intelligent, he quickly put this sense and purpose into action, concretizing it in a name that will be forever remembered: Batman...(tene nene nene nene)... Batman. . .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it was...just as he planned it would be.&nbsp; During the day, we see Bruce Wayne---Gotham&rsquo;s most eligible bachelor: rich, famous, smart, what more could you ask for, girls?---walking through the metropolis head-high accomplishing all that is expected of him and nothing more.&nbsp; But at night, he is Batman---secretive, heroic, but with a hidden agenda---roaming through Gotham&rsquo;s streets accomplishing all he expects of himself, and so much more.&nbsp; He beats up all kinds of villains from petty thieves to rapists to murderers.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to kill them if circumstance necessitates, and more often that not, it does.&nbsp; It would be tedious to psychoanalyze all the antagonists in Batman&rsquo;s life so now, we only focus on one.&nbsp; The villain of inquiry for us today, ladies and gentlemen, is someone named the Joker.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joker&rsquo;s real name prior to assuming that stupid alias is Jack Napier.&nbsp; He was a member of the mafia and did all kinds of bad stuff from stealing to murder.&nbsp; He became one of Batman&rsquo;s victims of no mercy when Batman let him fall into this pit of chemicals which permanently damaged him physically, emotionally, and mentally.&nbsp; The joker was psychotic...that was harsh, sorry.&nbsp; Well, from a psychodynamic springboard, we see the Freudian concepts of id, ego, and super ego coming into play.&nbsp; Joker was so caught up with his id, not giving a damn whether or not his pleasure-seeking instincts were in conflict with society&rsquo;s rules, or if they were even moral.&nbsp; Nah, all that mattered to him was that his &ldquo;needs&rdquo; were met.&nbsp; Batman, in contrast, did not let his id rule.&nbsp; He attained a balance with these structures.&nbsp; He took into account his id &ndash; instinctual call to punish all criminals, his ego &ndash; the demands of reality to return to his Bruce Wayne identity as a normal citizen, and his superego &ndash; his conscience...although that part wasn&rsquo;t so evident because of the countless people he killed.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another essential concept to describe Batman and the Joker is Alfred Adler&rsquo;s Individual Psychology.&nbsp; This is kinda ironic because Adler was against Freud&rsquo;s adherence to the power of the unconscious mind.&nbsp; But oh well, both of them are motivated by their goals and purposes in life.&nbsp; The indelible line is drawn by their different ways of living up these goals and purposes.&nbsp; Batman grew up with everything good around him.&nbsp; Everything just shattered when his parents died.&nbsp; So as a result, it is only apt that he chose the path of good as well.&nbsp; In contrast, Joker grew up with everything bad around him.&nbsp; All he saw was crime and violence even before he became the Joker.&nbsp; Here we see the impact of the influences a person has in his or her life.&nbsp; The things and people around a person, although seemingly insignificant at times, are indeed great factors for who and what that person will eventually become.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That in a nutshell is Joker and Batman in comparison.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a final note, let&rsquo;s tackle the climax between hero and villain, the battle of good vs evil.&nbsp; In one of the encounters of Batman and Joker, the latter uttered, &ldquo;Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?&rdquo;&nbsp; Joker said he liked saying this line to his victims before they died because it had a nice &ldquo;ring&rdquo; to it.&nbsp; Well it indeed affected Batman.&nbsp; Apparently, this line triggered Batman to retrieve the flashbulb memory of his parents dying in front of him with none other than Joker, then Jack Napier, as the murderer.&nbsp; Flashbulb memories are memories stored with a great deal of emotion in them.&nbsp; They are usually very personal and are almost always more accurately retrieved than other memories.&nbsp; And even at a time long after the actual occurrence, all that&rsquo;s needed is something, anything at all, that will turn on the bulb so to speak.&nbsp; Joker&rsquo;s supposedly goodbye statement triggered Bruce Wayne to remember that dreadful day and it affected his decision-making immensely.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the final stretch of the movie, we see Joker cajoling Batman, challenging him to a duel of popularity.&nbsp; Joker wanted to be the &ldquo;king&rdquo; of Gotham and it ate him alive that Batman was rivaling him in popularity.&nbsp; Anyway, Batman in his normal state of mind, wouldn&rsquo;t even mind the childish challenge.&nbsp; But because of the flashback memory and the fact that Vicky Vale (his current object of affection) was hostage, all feelings of hatred and the want for revenge resurfaced.&nbsp; Batman&rsquo;s id has managed to dominate his mind and his instinctive drift drove him to accept.&nbsp; In the end, Joker died.&nbsp; Good has once again prevailed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I guess Batman isn&rsquo;t such a bad superhero after all.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t altruistic, was what is ideal for all heroes, but I guess it&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp; The egoism is justified with Gotham being free of the Joker forever.&nbsp; So happy ending?&nbsp; Nah...I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; There are many more villains, others more threatening than the Joker.&nbsp; And Bruce Wayne will never have peace unless all those bastards are put to an end.&nbsp; The revenge was attained, but the hatred still remains... 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Batman...(tene nene nene nene)...Batman!"

Brown out tomorrow.&nbsp; Fucker meralco's gonna fix stuff in our building so Yori and I are off to sleep over at Twinkle's place.&nbsp; 

Have you guys ever watched Harry Met Sally?&nbsp; The movie starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal?&nbsp; Its a really really good movie.&nbsp; Along with A Walk in the Clouds, and Wicker Park.&nbsp; Yes, I've watched 3 movies in half a day.&nbsp; That's how bored I am.

The idea of cleaning my room thoroughly has crossed my mind, though.&nbsp; Haven't done my traditional general cleaning after a sem ends yet.&nbsp; Maybe I'll do that now...Bye."

Jokes aside, reading this list DID make me cringe; I've always had a kind of phobia of loud noises, and the thought of using sound as a method of torture always seemed scary to me.
While they had some obvious choices of music on the list (AC/DC, Metallica, Saliva, etc.,) some of the choices make me cringe in a different way. Choices like Barney's song, Star Spangled Banner, and the Meow Mix jingle take the idea from ""cruel and unusual"" to ""twisted and bizarre."" I mean what the fuck, being forced to listen to the Meow Mix jingle at high volumes sounds like something out a bad comedy/horror movie about a clown serial killer."

Wow. I am honestly speechless over this one. I don't think you need to be a /b/tard to find this at least a bit frightening. What do you say about a major service provider blocking a website, effectively censoring the internet that reaches their customers?
In a more populated market, this would not even be a problem, as a person would be able to switch service providers if they didn't like being censored. Unfortunately for some people that live in rural areas, there is often only one service provider to choose from; their choice would be no internet or censored internet.
I'm really hoping this isn't the start of a huge trend on internet censorship.

The battle for net neutrality may be about to kick into high gear, folks. Stay tuned.

UPDATE: Apparently, according to both AT&T as well as m00t, the reason for the blocking was not censorship, but rather the result of some ""errant traffic"" that was causing some AT&T switchers some problems. The block was apparently lifted last night.

So some dumb girl was texting while walking and fell into an open manhole cover. She's blaming the DEP for ""failing to secure the area"" and trying to get a lawsuit, all the while failing to realize how close she came to receiving a Darwin Award for removing herself from the gene pool. Damn that rule about having to kill or sterilize yourself in the process!

>Alexa Longueira, a high school sophomore, was walking along Victory Boulevard near Travis Avenue on Staten Island Wednesday evening when she felt the earth move and was plunged into smelly darkness.
>she felt the earth move and was plunged into smelly darkness.
Poetry! Sheer poetry! What a great way to start an article on this subject!

>She said the manhole she fell in to was left open and unattended with no warning signs or orange cones. She said two workers with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection failed to secure the area as they prepared to flush the sewer. 
>""Because of their careless mistake I got hurt.""
Okay, so YOU were texting. YOU weren't looking where you were going. Yet somehow this is their fault? I've been to New York. I've seen how many people are walking around. Nobody else made the same idiot mistake you did. Out of all the people there, you seem to be the only one that needs a seeing eye dog stapled to your face.

>""Regardless of whether I'm texting or not if there was a cone there I'm going to see a big orange cone... I walk that sidewalk every day, I don't expect a big hole there.""
You know, there's a reason that people look forwards while they walk: so they can see what's in front of them. You can sure as fuck bet that a caveman would have looked forward as he was walking. (inb4 Geico caveman references.) You know why? Because if a motherfucking sabertooth tiger were to jump out in front of Oog, he sure as hell better have been able to see him in time to lift his spear, or he'd have been having his dinner that night in Soviet Russia. (""Where tiger eats you!"") Just because you don't have to worry about sabretooth tigers does not mean you shouldn't be looking forward while you walked.
When I was much younger, I used to play my Gameboy while walking. You know what made me realize I should stop? The fact that I couldn't see what was in front of me. Telephone posts, people, chairs, it didn't matter. I would either bump into it or come damn close to. On top of that, it makes you look like an awkward fuck, tuned out from the rest of the world. I'm convinced that the reason that doing the same thing with cell-phones is considered socially acceptable is because most of the world (at least the parts of the world that have even seen a cell-phone) doesn't know better, like a toddler who puts his hands down his pants in public.
If I receive a text message while I'm walking that I absofuckinglutely have to answer right away, I stop walking for a bit. Sure I waste precious seconds typing out the message (what with the miracle of T9 predictions and all), but I end up not setting myself up for a huge embarrassment like this.

>""It could have been an elderly person, a mother pushing a stroller. It could have been anyone.""
Assuming they were looking forward, no.

Please nobody take this as me saying ""omg evry1 who txts whil walkin iz dum an shuld diee,"" because that's not the point at all. I'm just baffled at this entire thing. The way that someone could so shamelessly play victim on this situation at a national scale while keeping a straight face and not cry themselves to sleep for being such a public failure, and furthermore actually get a judge to rule in their favor. Not saying a judge will or not in this case. Sillier cases have won, though.
Do they just give away frivolous cases like this to the plaintiff every now and then so when a judge rules in favor of Evil Billionaire Guy #3286, it <i>doesn't</i> look like they always go in favor of the big guys."

Wow, this is some fucked up shit. It's not that they denied him for using marijuana, it's the fact that he was using medical marijuana, as in he was using it legally that makes me rage at this.

<i>Most transplant centers struggle with the how to deal with people who have used marijuana, said Dr. Robert Sade, director of the Institute of Human Values in Health Care at the Medical University of South Carolina.
<b>""Marijuana, unlike alcohol, has no direct effect on the liver. It is however a concern ... in that it's a potential indicator of an addictive personality,""</b> Sade said.</i>
Addictive personality, yeah. Because anyone who smokes weed MEDICINALLY is a total boozer too.

As long as we're denying transplants to people who use medical marijuana, let's at least keep everything consistent and deny them to people who take Xanax medicinally. I mean people take that recreationally too, don't they? Anyone who takes that medicinally must have an addictive personality too!

I just seems like what they're doing is trying to reaffirm that marijuana is addictive while at the same time denying the addictiveness of the medications they usually prescribe."

"event","Haha, I love anti-pot commercials on TV. There's so true, the way they depict smokers, because everyone who does, has, or will smoke pot really can fit into one broad, humorous, not to mention insulting stereotype. Just like you can use stereotypes of similar natures to describe anyone who likes alcohol, sex, Chinese food, or sunlight. HA!
OMG everyone who likes alcohol is a beligerent drunk deadbeat.
OMG everyone who likes sex is a dirty, filthy degenerate irresponsible godless hedonistic deadbeat.
OMG everyone who likes chinese food is a poor college-student deadbeat.
OMG, all people who like sunlight are batshit crazy fools who like to go outside for no other reason to walk around in the woods, marvelling at the ""beauty of nature"" or some other silly thing when they could be inside, where they can be kept track of and not hurt anyone because they're all dirty new-agey deadbeats who probably hate the guvver-mint.
But seriously, folks, my point is that you can't just throw anyone into one group. Yes, there are some people who fit the ""pothead"" stereotype, but let's not generalize to the point where we think everyone is like that.

I don't watch much TV, but it seems whenever I do, I find something that manages to infuriate me, whether it's some new sleazy, bullshit ""reality"" show, a commercial for some new thing that you <u>absolutely need</u>, not to mention pretty much EVERYTHING I've seen on the news lately.

But them <i>Above the Influence</i> ads... these guys don't mess around, do they? Oh no, they skip the weak-ass and occasionally humorous stereotyping and go directly for the throat by insulting the intelligence anyone who smokes. They subtlely (and not-so-subtlely) make it look like the only reason anyone smokes is because they don't have a personal identity, or are idiots, or are just really impressionable.
A pot smoker is <u>not</u> something you are. A musician is something you are. A philosopher is something you are. A teacher is something you are. Shit, a janitor is something you are. Smoking is merely something you do, and anyone with half a brain knows that. Smoking (under any reasonable circumstances) is not something you do to define yourself with, and if you do, well, you really must suck at life.

Though before I end this, let me just say that I fully respect a person's right to say no to anything. It's a person's own choice whether or not he/she decides to do anything, and I would never pressure anyone into doing something they don't want. But please, PLEASE, <b>PLEASE</b>, world. Don't judge me for what I do if I am not hurting you in the process.

EDIT: Janitor probably wasn't the best choice of words here, as it would probably go under something one does, rather than what one is... I was just thinking of <i>Half Baked</i> at the time..."

What the fuck! It's shit like this which really fucking kills me, and makes me think that if shit were to go down, everyone in this country would fucking die just because nobody would be willing to help anyone else because everyone hates everyone who isn't like them.
Granted, I'm fine either way; I think it should be up to whoever is saying it whether they want to say ""Merry Christmas"" or ""Happy Holidays."" But these conservatives don't even realize that by forcing everyone to say ""Merry Christmas"" instead of ""Happy Holidays,"" they're really no better than the liberals they condemm. Personally, I'd be more likely to say ""Happy Holidays,"" but if someone were to say ""Merry Christmas"" to me, I wouldn't hold it against them. Hell, I'd just say ""Merry Christmas"" to them too.

BUT WE HAD TEH MERRY KRISSMUS FURST! OMG!
Yuletide, you troglodytes. Look it up. It's not new information or anything

No, people who get into brawls over the last hot product are grinches. People who drive like assholes on the highways are grinches. People who give shit to people who have to work in stores around this time of year are grinches. And most of all, people who make up this imaginary ""War for Christmas"" are fucking grinches.

"event","Can someone PLEASE kill that fucking <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_frog"">Crazy Frog</a> thing? You know, it's that obnoxious-as-fuck sample of that guy/girl/gender-ambiguous thing making those motorcycle/racecar sounds.
""Riiingdingdingbabawwwwbadabaaaaaaaaa"" or however it is. Yeah, I laughed when I heard it in that ""Insanity Test"" Flash file that was going around on the intarweb, what is it, four years ago? Then again, I didn't even know what it was back then. I thought it was someone just sounding like an idiot. But now they have shit dance music put behind it? Uh... no! What is it with these idiot businessmen digging up the corpses of internet phenomena and trying to make assloads of money off of these things? And while I'm asking that, when did the general public become so braindead that they'd actually buy these products whose musical value is pretty much nonexistant and whose novelty would wear off after about a minute to anyone with an IQ over that of gorgonzola?
And don't try to argue that there is any musical value to this, because there isn't, even in the most abstract sense, anything musical about taking half-assed novelty dance songs, most of which have already lost any appeal they originally had, and putting some retarded sample over it that isn't even funny anymore to anyone who has been on the internets for the past three years or so.

If I ever saw that fucking frog in real life, I'd probably pick it up and lick it, and then light it on fire and squish it when I find out that it's not hallucinogenic.

"event","So I had this dream last night, right? In it, for some reason, I was watching all these really funny slasher films. At one point, I suddenly got up, ran around an yelled, ""SAN DIMAS HIGH-SCHOOL FOOTBALL RUUUUUUUUUUUUULES!""
I haven't even been watching Bill & Ted!"

"event","Yeah, I spent several hours today with my roomies, moving shit out of our old room and into our new one. The school made us freakin' move all our shit into a different building since I guess they want buildings 1, 2, and 4 to be all college students, with normal residents still living in 3 or something.
So my impressions on the new room? It's big... at least the living room/kitchen area is. The whole place has a much higher ceiling. My problem with it, though, is that the bathroom and bedrooms are significantly smaller. We can't even fit both two desks in the bedrooms after getting the beds and dressers in, so Mike and I have our desks out in the main room. But yeah, we don't even have cable (which we were supposed to have) and only just got our internet. At least they got the heat working in here, which is good since they say it's supposed to drop to freezing tonight. We didn't use the heat much before, since we were on the third floor, but I'm glad we have it here.
Yeah, that's what's going on here."

"event","Last night, I saw the premiere of The Boondocks with my roomie, Ryan. He'd never heard of it before. (Not even the comic strip.) If you missed it, you have no idea what you missed. It was just funny as hell, and I love how all the characters translated to animated form. Granddad's voice sounded exactly like I imagined him. I can't wait to see the next episode :-D
And the art style? I loved it. It had an East-meets-West look to it, and the opening credits reminded me very much of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo."

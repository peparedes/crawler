My co-worker bought 3 skeins of this beautiful alpaca and silk yarn at an alpaca farm in Cape May, New Jersey.  She isn't a knitter but is a huge alpaca fan and the colorway of autumn colors is perfect for her.  She asked me to knit it up for her but 3 skeins wasn't going to make a very long scarf.

I don't know why it took me so long to think of this but I had a flash of inspiration and went on Ravelry's yarn database and found someone willing to sell me her 3 skeins of the same yarn.

Here is the finished product.  The lighting isn't that great today--had to take photos inside because it's a rainy day here."

This was my third time at MDSW and the first time I knew what I was doing!

I'll be making pink ribbon socks for myself with the Panda Silk, Eagles Socks for my daughter with the green and black Regia, another Montego Bay scarf with the lime/violet Unique sheep yarn and either socks or a shawl with the sock yarn from Mama E.

This should get me through until Stitches East."

"event","I haven't written anything for a long time because I wasn't sure what kind of things I wanted to write. I read lots of knitting blogs and I enjoy the funny ones and look for the ones with free patterns.  I'm not that funny and I don't have any free patterns.

I read lots of other blogs and I'd love to use this as a place to vent but I'm afraid of saying something that will come back to bite me in my butt.  

So while I try to decide where I'm going:

Saturday is the party for my dad's 80th birthday.  I'm giving him the Irish Hiking Scarf and some candy.  Mom is getting the Clapotis even though they don't want Christmas gifts and I'm still not feeling comfortable with the way the colors turned out.  I wish I could cut out that one bright pink stripe.

I still have to finish the scarf that I'm going to give to my friend with Cerebral Palsy.  I'm just using Caron's Simply Soft in Orchid and white.  I was making the Besotted Scarf with the cable Xs and Os but that was in raspberry wool and I didn't want her to have to deal with wool.  I'll finish that one for myself.  

MDCAPSFAN wound my Peace Fleece hanks into these cool balls for me.

I'll just be admiring the colors for a while until I find patterns.  Everything I've read about this yarn says that it softens up with washing and it's not enough for a sweater so it looks like I have more scarves in my future."

The party Friday night was a big success.  Carol seemed very happy.  The granddaughters were a riot.  The first cousin rivalry was amusing to me and probably annoying to most of the room.  Note to self:  don't retire until grandchildren can be seen and not heard.  ""Just kidding""

Peyton is being very funny.  She learned to say UP but the p is drawn out and accompanied by lots of spit.  What she wants right now is to sit in my lap and use the computer.  I need a new keyboard or she needs one of her own."

This is the shawl that I made for my supervisor's retirement party.  The yarn is Lion Brand Homespun in the color they call Country.  The pattern is their Prayer Shawl pattern without the fringe.  I don't like knitting with large needles anymore and solid yarns are boring after a while.  This was a perfect project for watching TV.

This is my finished Clapotis, unblocked.  Now if only I knew how to block it!

I intended it to be for my mom for Christmas but now I'm not sure about the colors.  There is an irritating stripe of pink that just doesn't belong.

Yesterday as I was nearing the homestretch I had a few moments of panic that I wouldn't have enough yarn.  So I pushed myself to finish just to be sure and ended up with a paltry amount leftover.  Whew, that was just too close for comfort but ended happily.  At $8 a skein, I didn't need one left that wouldn't be enough to do anything with.  And this yarn was from Sea Needles in Bethany Beach and I haven't seen it anywhere else."

"event","<p>I am almost finished knitting my second Girlfriend's Swing Coat for Princess Leia. The purple one didn't meet with her approval because she is really into pink right now. I really wanted a second chance at the pattern anyway and I did use very inexpensive yarn so it's no big deal. For the purple one I followed the directions and made the applied I cord edging. For the pink one I wanted to try the seed stitch edging and it looks like I messed up and caused one side to be stretched out longer than the other. For the purple one I knit the sleeves flat and seamed them up but for the pink one I want to learn to use double pointed needles. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

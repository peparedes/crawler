An interesting comment was made by me today, and perhaps I would have already forgotten it, if it weren't for my Project Manager who repeated said comment a few times; with the incorporation of gay-isms [he's straight].

Me: I just don't recall the last time I was happy.
Eric: Seriously? But it sounded like you had a great weekend.
Me: No, not that kind of happy.
Eric: You mean Gay-Happy?
Me: Yes.
Eric: Seriously Matt, when were you last ""happy""
Me: 2002, before I came out.
Eric: Oh Matt, I can totally see you in this Gay-Womb where you feel so safe, and then *poof* you're OUT.

"event","Today I was at the store to buy Berries, toothpaste, ReddiWhip and bananas.

While shopping in the dairy section [where I wasn't supposed to be] i heard high-pitched voices coming from the left and when I turned away from the yogurt display I was met with a hoard of children from ages  9-12 being loud and very inconsiderate. It looked like they had just come from a highlighter party, but used permanent marker instead of highlighters. Really, it was quite depressing. 
As I wandering over to the chilled juice section [where I wasn't supposed to be] i heard a loud THUD and figured one of the children had fallen, and potentially injured themselves - this was not the case. No, they dropped a 24-pack of orange soda on the ground, and simply abandoned it... maybe someone should do the same with them.
While making my way up to the cashier through the frozen dessert section [where I wasn't supposed to be] I came about some ice cream cones the children had knocked over while running a muck. Hur-ray.
Finally, I am at the cashier unloading my basket, when one of the children [9ish] comes up behind me to wait in the express line. Well, he watched me unload the basket as I do ADD style and when I was done I stared right back at him while putting the basket on the ground and said, ""I think you left some of your items on the floor in the dairy aisle. Maybe you should go pick them up so you can pay for them"" The child just stared at me like WTF was I talking about, and I stared back at him. Of course I used my creepy mono-tone voice which is very parental/adult-like, which I only use in meetings and when I am pissed off. It was all quite fun, and the cashier [the cute cashier without the snaggle-tooth] looked at me and asked how my day was, and I said, ""It's going a lot better now."" We smiled, and I walked away.

When I got home, I had forgotten t buy ReddiWhip - damn!"

5. Still awake, and not going out - lame.
6. Hanging out with Katie for a bit Sunday - super.
7. Need to wake up early - blah!
8. Will attempt a shopping trip early in the morning - interesting.
9. Going to ""Dancing with the Stars"" on Tuesday with Sister, Dad, + other person - cool?
10. I don't watch ""Dancing with the Stars"" so this is kinda wasted on me, but fun?

Alright, I need to hop to bed, and dream about how this is going to be a cool month.

When I say ""long"" I mean like (very long^3) and with this sort of stagnation that has occurred there have been a lot of things I haven't gotten to say. Earlier today I had time to meditate on my what I can only describe as my ""Top phrases of affection I have yet to/have said in quite some time.""

10. NO, seriously, stop.
9. OK, you win.
8. I'm glad you're so warm.
7. Wanna go out for drinks?
6. I miss you.
5. Will you take out the trash?
4. Ouch, NO,*haha* stop, *haha*, I'm ticklish!
3. Can I wear your pants today?
2. When can we go 'fake' register at {insert retail store name here}
1. Stop being such a dork.

I've said once, and I'm gonna say it again. In the off chance I snag me a boy, ya'll gonna be dropped like a bad habit. No, seriously, I often think that I act as I do towards my friends, because YOU are my world. I do fear the day though when it won't be so ... can't we all just stay single so as to make my world function? Appease me dammit.

However, as a result of having said boy around, everything might be kicked up a few knotches in which case the real world as you know it might implode - cool.

At any-rate my mind is going a mile a minute right now. 

Though I didn't take a baZILLION pictures this weekend, I drank the most of the cousins and parents .... HURRAY YOUTHFUL LIVER! I drive back to Newport in the morning, I might stop by Disneyland since I took all of Monday off.

HURRAY GAY!

Who was I talking to the other day? I forget. The point is we decided that I am a ""homebody"" gay but I have ""clubbing"" traits ... talk about nutty. I think the best moment of this concept is when I am cleaning with the TV on, and then I start dancing to the music from commercials. Yep, gay. Gay, gay, gay.

Maybe my homebody_ness is what causes the problems for those times I go out dancing? Kinda like two personalities clashing and neither one can take control - to clean or drink.

In other news, I think I should try and remove myself from the state for New Years.

btw, how the HELL do you 'catch a cup a coffee?!' what  a dumbass.

last night was fun. i like spending time with the girls, and it was the first time in a  LONG time that so many were available. I really enjoyed getting to see my Pop Artist icons. Le sigh. It makes me sad that they are dead. But DAMN there were a lot of cute, metro-gay guys at the museum. damn.

IN CONCLUSION! I am going against the Gay Rules of drinking for awhile. One bottle of wine, or a 6-pack of beer a week for a spell. I have turned into a lush, and need to cut back. [please note that friends can still buy me drinks, and i will drink them. yes. yum yum yum.]

"event","ssoo i haven't been a complete faaf whilst up here... i have been organizing 30+ years of photos taken by my parents/family. Needless to say this is taking a chunk of time. my mom can't do it because she 'reflects' on each picture while i am more the 'ok this is halloween'. ANYWAYS the point of this post is...

going through all these pictures makes me sad for the following reasons:
1. i will never feel the enjoyment a parent feels over all off a youths accomplishments.
2. i never got to know my grandfather taylor, and when you see only 6 pictures [the same one mind you] within a sea of 30 years of pictures it makes you kinda sad.
3. i wish i could have one memory of my aunt *god i can't even remember her name ... and i KNOW it was a pretty one too....
LINDA! Aunt Linda!
4. people die. and when you don't have a good picture; let alone a memory; of them it kinda pisses ya off.

eventually, some of these images will make it here AND on myspace.com. until then just picture me in a CREEPY bugs bunny halloween costume that looks errie-ly like bob from donnie darko.

by far, the person i would most like to meet that i never set eyes on would be Aunt Linda. I never heard much about her, only that she was awesome. I bet the two of us could've been drinking buddies.

let us not forget... from the original taylor group only 50% are still around.

OH in other news, called HAWT Sean from the bar friday night [ you know the whole 24hr call waiting rule] and we played phone tag today, but we MIGHT get together monday night ....

So I go over to Josh's apt and then we proceed to migrate to Santana Row which is horribly crowded and we can't get on a wait list for dinner that is less than 40 minutes; yuck! We cross the street to Valley Fair and decide that Sushi Boat is the golden ticket for the night. We get the food and then we get the beer [ya, two queens with japanese beer = hawt]. Shortly After we walk over to Nordstroms for a big sale or something [current time 9:15pm] and are throw into a RAGING group of people going MAD about the sale. Josh decided we needed cute shoes so that is where we went. Got NO service and then this bitchy gal said she'd be 'right with us' and then DITCHED US! ... let me tell you, you KNOW two fags are going to buy shit at  a sale, so she just cut off her commission leg [bitch].  The two of us almost got the same shoes, but then I went with more of a bowling style which is SO cute! I just HAD to wear them out of the store.

...as we left the mad we planned to head to the gay dive bar 5 blocks down near blossom ave...  OH and a damn kiosyk lady cute of my finger.

Now at bar...

Sooooooo Josh and I go just for fun and drinks when I look up and see a face from myspace OMG. 

Well, after 20 minutes of my detective/CSI  work I found out what 'Sean' was drinking and walk over to him and said ""hey, i heard you might like this' gave him the drink and invited him to sit with Josh and muah? Please keep in mind that the average age of the bar iss 45 WITH me, josh and sean being there.

WE all talked till closing [like 2 hours??! and did the number thing.

Wow, that was fun!

Why can't Orange County be fun like that?

Oh, Sean is hot btw. I wanted to SERIOUSLY do naughty stuff. Instead it was just being played out in my mind ... slow motion like.

I guess a bit of the OLD Matt died last night.

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I said to myself: this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin.

so MANY decisions. 

what about slo?! hmm maybe. hmmmmm

SO what do YOU think i should do?

AZ
SJ/SF
LA
SLO
or the last option being a random trip out of the western united states.

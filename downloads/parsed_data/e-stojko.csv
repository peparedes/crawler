--I'm sure I'll pay for it anyway.
--Despite what Rudy says he still looks HOT with blue hair.
--My boxers are too big for Rudy so either 1.) I need to lose some weight because retirement is doing me no good or 2.) I need to fee my husband more.
--Note to self, next time use Neon green hair dye so maybe not to upset people more.
--Vic looked great with Pink hair.

Firstly I have to say that I'm not 100% responsible for the giant head being fed exed to Canada. However I was involved and must have laughed the entire time the Fed Ex guy picked it up and almost an hour after he left. I think he had it coming and it was a damn good prank. 

Apparently Rudy's going over to the girls side. This should prove to be interesting. Ahead of time, I think we'll both have to stay out of pranks on each other and we can't be expected to conspire against each other. Although Rudy probably already has his own ideas on what he'd like to do to me as far as pranks go. Don't you all think dirty things.

I'm not saying who, but someone's going to end up with blue hair at the next show. You won't know who you are until it happens but don't worry it's not permanent. I have an awful feeling though that the girls are trying to cook up something big for us guys. I just might really have to run a hide this time. I'm having a harder time trying to get the guys to gang up on the girls. We'll see how things end up.

Sunday I went out with Vic to celebrate. You can read what he wrote but we had a good time. I did come home a little drunk which got me a talking to from Rudy. Of course he waited the next day when I had the hangover and he talked what seemed to be very loudly. ::laughs:: It was ok though he's wasn't really mad. 

We're back in Canada now. We have some things to do here. And I need to unpack still. Of course I probably won't for another week or until Rudy unpacks it. I'm horrible at unpacking things. What can you do, eh?

I have no planes to kill my husband. However I may have to have a good talking to him. Which I'm sure he sometimes considers as painful sometimes. Yes my lectures are not always the most exciting, but I give them because I care. In his case because I love him so much and he shouldn't be out in the cold without being warm. Right now I'm just helping him get better. It has a niceness to it, being domestic. I could definately get use to this. Well to some degree. I like to look after him but he worries me when he's not well. 

I think Rudy said when he's feeling better he's going to try to teach me to cook. The other day I was trying to be helpful and made waffles. However they didn't come out well at all. It called for egg whites and so I put the white of the egg. Later when I couldn't figure out what went wrong, I asked Rudy and he told me the white of the egg is the stuff around the yolk not the shells. I tried to explain they should have said to put in the clear part of the egg. It's not really white. The shell was white. So now Rudy said he's going to try to teach me basic cooking. This is almost scary.

Alright I'm going to check on Rudy. See you guys around.

Which is exactly what I had hoped.  Lena and Anton, Jamie and David and Tara are here to name just a few.  Not to mention the goregous Rudy.  Then again, I'm a little bias with him.

So we're hardly on the road at all, and we've had our first mishap. Dave is in the hospital, I think Jamie summed it up best so I won't go into detail with that.  Though I'm still hoping she'll give in at let us take her back to the hotel to shower and change and at the least take a short nap in the car there and back.  Rudy and I did go get her breakfast, and Rudy over did it a little I think.  He said he didn't know what she wanted so he got her some choices.  He's very thoughtful at the least.  So I think we got scrambled eggs, some sort of omlette, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, toast, bagel, orange juice, cranberry juice and coffee.  Sounds more like what him and I ate when we were relaxing.  

We have a show tomorrow night.  They know if he's not well it's ok.  I just want him better, even if the show is better for him being in it.  I know all about how one needs to take care of one self.  

For now, I'm going to see if I can't pursuade Jamie to go back to the hotel again.

What else?  The tour is coming along great.  Well I mean everything behind the tour.  The tour starts in November, so we need to relax just a little beforehand.  Well that's my excuse anyway.  Granted it's not a huge tour but it's still a big project.

Thanksgiving was great.  Rudy got to have dinner with my family.  It was great.  Nothing better than good food and family around you.   Rudy wanted to help in the kitchen with mom and I think he really enjoyed that.  I tried to help, but ended up with more flour on me than in the cake, so I was quickly banned from the kitchen.  Rudy however, cooks amazing.  The food was so fantastic.  I tell you between my mom and Rudy, they made the best feast ever.

"event","I know it's been a while since I really updated about anything of any kind of importance.  We'll see how interesting this one gets.

First off, I am happy to report, that I have convienced Rudy to do some of the Elvis tour.  He was coming to visit and watch so, we figured things out to get him on the tour.  This is going to be even better than I had hoped.  It was great, because I had told my people the people I would like to see on tour and Rudy of course was one of them.  I had forgotten that they were still in the works.  Turns out, it worked out for us.  Yeah, so it really wasn't me, but still.  He's coming with me and really that's all that matters to me.

We're in Reno, and I'm quiet content here with Rudy.  We've been visiting alot with his family.  They are really great, and it makes me a little homesick to see my parents.  Of course, a few days with them will cure me of that.   I love them to death, but there's only so much of them I could handle.  Too much of them telling me how I should do things.  Eat more.  You need more clothes.  You need to redecorate.  You know how parents get.  I do love them though.  I miss them too.  Though, I think Rudy's mom has been trying to compensate for that.  She's done everything to help me feel part of the family already.  She's a great lady. And I must say she's raised a wonderful son.  I certainly like him anyway.  

I've been skating at the local rink lately.  Reno has a great ice rink.  I can see why Rudy uses it.  But you know what else Reno is great for?  Gambling and night life.  Rudy took me out the other night, apparently it was the slow week.  I still think there were lots of people.  We had fun going down the strip and going into the casinos.  I did spend a little money.  That's the whole point right?  I just wanted to play a few slots and a few table games so that I can say I did it all in a night.  Then we went to a dinner and show at El Dorado.  I'm still trying to convience him that we should rent a hotel room for a night or two and just make up a story, and be tourists.  He thought it was a silly idea.  I thought it sounded fun. 

Think of it.  Just going some place, and create a story.  Like we're married and on our honeymoon.  Whatever, and just be silly.  I don't know.  Maybe it sounds better in my head.  Oh well, a lot of things do.  I think maybe it would be fun too if there was a bunch of us.  Go from table to table and lose money, and be stupid.  

Ok, so yet another entry that had very little to it.  I did try though.  Give me a little credit for that.

Rudy and I are back in Reno, NV.  We've been having a really great time spending time with each other.  I've been going to the rink and practicing, since the Elvis tour is coming up.  I'm going to have to go to Canada, sooner than I would like to.  Of course, I don't want to leave Rudy, so anytime is too soon.  He said if he can work it out, he's going to come to a few shows or even come watch me practice which will be nice.

Oh, I want to thank everyone who posted pictures of me yesterday.  I'm still getting use to the whole idea of days.  What really is it for?

The wedding was gorgeous.  Tim and Alexei looked great and so happy.  Rudy and I had such a great time as ushers.  I think he had a too much fun on the initial wedding recap.  Just my humble opinion.  Yes, I did try to get Vic and Shae with cake.  And yes, I did get them really good.  They love me though.  It just woudn't be right if I didn't try that.  They were too clean.  As Shae said, I was pulled off before I could smash cake into Vics face.  Probably good for me.  

As for what we're doing now, I think we're leaving back to Reno tomorrow or Friday.  I'll have to check the ticket.  I want to say tomorrow though.  I'm going to be staying with Rudy a little longer before going back to practice for the tour.

You know, I'm just going to have to try to update more later.  I'm going to crawl into bed.   But considering I've already done more than Rudy, I'd say I'm doing alright.

We didn't get to do too much, because we had to catch a plane to New Zealand.

And now we are in New Zealand.  Rudy keeps going on and on about how cute Alexei and Tim are.  I think it's sweet.  He's really happy for the two of them.  So am I.  It's been a long time since there's been so much happiness going around.  Not just with them, but it seems we're hitting a high with a lot of couples around here.  I still have some work on helping some of the girls out though.  I haven't forgotten, I'm still looking!

New Zealand is beautiful.  I've never really visited here before so I think Rudy and I might do a little sight seeing this weekend.  It'll be a nice way to unwind from all the skating and just be together.  I'm looking forward to the time we spend together and for the wedding.  People are already starting to arrive and I heard that more are coming this weekend.  It's going to end up being a party weekend, I can feel it. 

Ok, I know this is still rather a lame update, but I've decided I'm rather lame.  So it works for me.  But seriously, I'm still alive and kicking and I'll see most of you guys soon I'm sure.

Not happening.  I seemed to neglect Ms. Marshall, and couldn't write a coherant thought to Keri.  So, I'm going to try to do this off of AIM.  My deepest apologies to you ladies.  I just didn't get any writing done. 

Lena and Anton's wedding was marvelous.  It was great to see everyone and it was excellent seeing Lena and Anton so happy.  Actually there was quite a bit of happiness going around.  It's great to see it spreading.  

We're back and doing more shows.  I can't believe tomorrow is the last day.  It's been too great, and somehow I just can't find the words to say to everyone how fantastic of a time I've had.  So I'll just say, I had a great time with all of you.  Here's to another tour with each and every one of you.  

Rudy has been MIA this afternoon.  I'm sure he's probably with the girls.  I found myself sucked into watching a bizzare movie.  It really was interesting but then again, I think I may have to actually watch it and not try to do anything else.  It's strange to actually have a room to myself.  Vic is off with Shae and Rudy again isn't here.  

Alright, so it really wasn't much of an update, but hey, I tried, right.   Someone should come and find me and keep me company.

"event","Ok, so if you've read Rudy's update, you pretty much know what's been going on with me too.  I was allowing him to break the news when and if he even wanted it out.  On my end, I'm doing well.  I'm a little sluggish from the medication they have me on, please don't worry, it's precautionary only.  I am still crazy for Rudy.  I think he's taking things very personal.  I think he's blaming himself too much.  Of course, I'm sure I would if the tables were turned, but I don't blame him at all.  Anyhow, I think that is enough said for now.  Feel free to ask me questions, I just don't feel like beating a dead horse right now.

I'm thinking more and more that staying with Rudy for awhile after COI is a good idea.  He's been distant lately, even with me as he mentioned and I think some time alone could be what we need.  I mean it'll give us time to work through a few emotional issues I hope.  I would also just really enjoy spending time with him.  So, I think I'll be doing that before going back to Canada. At that point, I hope Rudy will come back with me, but that's up to him and we'll give him some time before we have him commit.

Ok, I've rambled a bit.  I'm getting a little tired again.

We have three days off and I plan to spend them for the most part with Rudy.  We've made a habit lately of taking a walk around every city and ""losing"" ourselves.  So we might just have to lose ourselves for 3 days.  We'll see since I'm sure he'll want to go shopping with the girls sometime.  

Aparently, I've been keeping Rudy very busy, but he says he'll update within the next few days.  So Nicole, you can look forward to that.

I was of course for the ride, but I let him know, he never really did anything to me.  We all had our bad days.  Still, dinner was fabulous.  I got this great idea that we should mess with the waitresses head for fun, so we would rotate pretending to be Shae's date.  We would move our plates and places to be next to Shae and take turns holding her hand or having our arm around her.  At first the watress didn't seem to notice, but by the time, we started shuffling plates, she started to give us strange looks.  A couple of times it looked like she was going to ask us, but she decided not to.  Still it was funny and we all had a laugh.

It was also great being out with Vic and Shae with Rudy.  Rudy and I really haven't been out with anyone for dinner or shopping as a couple.  Though Vic and Shae are probably use to it by now.  We're always really couplish in front of them.  They're probably about ready to smack us. 

Today, I'm going to watch Rudy practice and then practice myself.  Nothing too exciting.  Things have been a bit tense here for all the controversies going on.  I hate seeing everyone stressed out.  And of course, I've heard about Oksana.  I wish it wasn't so stressful for everyone.  If there's anything I can do, please let me know.

Before we got there, the poor girl was beginning to get nervous.  I have forgotten how nerve wracking a first date with someone you hardly know is, let alone someone you don't know.  I helped her calm down and by the time we were at the restaurant she was calm.  

I think I got sight of her secret admirer first.  I must have smiled because she wanted to know what I saw.  But then she looked where I was looking at and she saw him.  Who was sitting at a table with a red rose? (that was the sign of who she was to meet btw)  None other than our, or should I say her very own   <lj user=""_peter_t"">.   Needless to say, I was not needed to stay any longer, so after I said hello and explained why I was there, I left the two to enjoy their dinner.  After that, you'll have to ask Naomi.

"event","There seems to be something in the air around here.  It's very tense and almost cold.  I think that all these pranks are getting out of hand.  Someone has warped something fun and innocent into an all out bloodbath.  I realize it probably has to do with the tour coming to a close.  No one wants it to, especially me.  So, I'm not sure if this is exactly why the pranks are getting to an all time craziness or not.  I just don't want to see anyone leave here, with maybe the exception of one, with any bad feelings.  You know everyone loves everyone and it was started in good fun, but who really is letting them get out of hand?

Ok, onto a little different subject.  Well different than the above anyway.  I've decided that after COI, I'm going to go to Reno with Rudy to visit with him a while.  I know I have to get ready for the Elvis tour, but that's nothing I can't really practice for at any rink.  Besides, it's just a visit.  He said he may actually come on tour for a few days.  I think that would be great.  

I'm really enjoying my time with Rudy.  He's been my friend for more years than I care to count and it's funny how something so great is right under your nose.  I was talking to Tara about her feelings for Kurt. She said she was afraid to tell him how she felt.  I had to use me as an example.  I mean, things would be a lot different right now if Rudy didn't take a chance and kiss me.  They wouldn't be bad, I mean, I would still be happy and clueless and probably running around pranking people, so no, it wouldn't be bad.  But, it wouldn't have included some of the greatest days I've had of my life.  It wouldn't include the intense feelings I have for him.  So there were two paths, and I'm happy we have choosen the one we did.  

Forgive me, it seems I'm sorta into a deep feeling sort of mood.  I told someone once that I like to feel more than think.  I think that's only partially true.  There are situations that I think thinking is perfect for, however there are times that you have to let your feelings run wild and take over.  It is of course our feelings for each other, that really set us apart from most other things.  I think it also does us good to let our feelings run wild for a day or so, no matter what may happen.  It opens us up to a variety of people, that we may never would become close to normally, it gives us the opportunity to remember that not everyone is bad, and most of all I think it reminds us that in order to feel so happy and so good, there has to be a down side.  It's the down side or bad times that make the good ones so great.  So let yourself go.  Tell someone something about yourself, you wouldn't normally tell.  Tell that crush you have exactly how you feel.  In the long run, it could be the best thing you ever did, even if it doesn't turn out the way you had hoped.

You know, I'm not sure I'm so good at this deep thinking bit.  Maybe I should just keep to my light spirited self.  What do you think?  Did I bore you guys to tears??  Ahh.. well I'll go then.  At least I said what was on my mind.

Oh, and one more thing.  Rudy, I don't care who knows.  I do love you.

I have been spending all my free moments with Rudy.  It's been the best few days I've had since I could remember.  I got to stay at his house, meet his mother and was given a tour of downtown Reno, from my boy friend.  It has been a good week indeed.  

So Rudy and I got to thinking about the recent bout of practical jokes.  All of them are ones that have crossed major lines.  We never really went over the lines of putting rubber anything in something we KNEW was a phoebia of someones, ie Oksana.  Everyone knows of her fears of spiders and that's just cruel.  The lastest of trading naomi's shampoo to pink hair dye is just as bad.  I mean, someone would have to go in the shower when she was in there and change it, right?  None of us would do that.  I've gone around asking everyone if they did it.  They are all telling me no.  I know I've been too busy with Rudy to even think about stuff like that.  So who does that leave us??  Well that leaves the girls themselves and Plushenko.  The one person I didn't ask.  We're not exactly on speaking terms since I apparently ""stole"" his boyfriend.  I'm not even going into that one right now.  Though I was warned I'd regret it, so it makes me wonder if he's not trying to frame me or one of the guys for the prank.  

I'm all for a good prank, I've fessed up to doing some, but I don't think any of use would go that far.  Do you?  Look at the pranks we pull.  Harmless ones.  Oh and I'm not sure about the water prank on Irina either.  I beleive the guys are innocent in the major ones is all I'm saying, well except maybe a certain blonde guy.

I had to leave him after a while though.  I ran into Oksana and apparently someone put a rubber spider in her bathroom.  For once, I'm completely innocent.  I was too busy hanging out with Rudy.  Anyhow, I invited her to my room to visit a while, since the poor girl is completely scared out of her mind.  Guys, just a side note, spiders, out.  Let's stick to snakes.  Anyhow, she should be here any moment.

I am on AIM.  Still figuring a lot of it out, but my screen name is EatingElvis.  Don't ask where it came from, and you can read whatever you want into that.  I have meet some new people, and some old friends, and even some of you nutty people on COI, around here.  I still have lots to learn though.  Anyone care to help me out in that department?

Rudy kissed me last night.  Completley took me off guard.  Not that I really minded, just really wasn't expecting that.  He had a lot on his mind and I guess I just thought he needed to get it out of his system.  Well this morning, he said he thought about it, and to make a long story short, I'm taking him to dinner after the show tonight.  I'm really looking forward to it.

It seems there's a really cool guy out there Craven who says he knows everything there is to know about me.  Tell me, should I be scared or should I be flattered?  Right now, I'm leaning towards flattered, since he was the first person to molest me in a nonthreatening sort of way.  Did I get that right Craven?  Ok, like anyone really reads this, but still.

Our shows have been going well, and yesterday we were in Rudy's hometown so he was really excited about it.  I think he skated better than usual, but that could have just been in my head.

"event","What do I do with this thing?  Some how I got tosseled into creating one of these things.  I'm not even sure what to do.  Anyhow, I'll wing it and see what happens.  Tonight we were in Sacramento.  It was actually a good show.  Tomorrow is San Jose and we're doing two shows.  Not to mention we have a little something planned for the ladies.  But we won't even go there, will we?

Hmm... Ok, so really I don't know what to write in this thing.  If you find me quickly it means I've added you already and you should know who I am anyway.  So I'll end it here.  That's right, right here. Not there, but here.

Colleen came down tonight. Only for like a damn hour or so. Loser. She was tired! BUM!!!!
Anyway .. she picked me up from work, and we headed to Wawa .. yum yum. Called Victor up cause we needed the keys to the house to pick up our movies. Sooo on our way to the house, there's this fuckin black guy ridin our ass. Well colleen don't take well to people doin that. So she kept slammin on her breaks and shit. Well, the light turns red, and she stops. This mother fucker pulls up next to us .. and rolls his window down .... SCREAMING his lungs out. He was being so unessacary. So i guess because we werent being ignornat and yelling back .. he got more angry and asked why we were ignoring him. So this *igger gets out of his car and starts bangin on the window [my side] and im like what the fuck man, i wanna get out and punch this dude in the face. Well the light turned green, he ran back into his car and flew off. We took his lisence plate number down and called the fuckin cops. Fuck that man. I hate people like that. Sooo yadda yadda yadda. 

Went back to tony's to drop the key off to Victor, and him and tommy were headed to another friends house I guess. Colleen got awfully tired..so she headed home. And now, is where i shall stay for the rest of the night. Bored outa my mind.

Why do I always fuck up? Why do I always always always without a doubt .. push people away. Esp the ones I love. Why do I do it? Am I freakin retarted? What is wrong with me? Someone please let me know. I feel like he hates me. Like he has to lie and go do something else, just so I don't know. I fuckin hate this shit. I hate myself. But I'm not gonna cry about it. I'm gonna sit here and write about it. I'm gonna sit up and think about it. I'm NOT gonna cry. I refuse to. I can't. I'm TOO FUCKING EMOTIONAL. Get over yourself Ilia. Fuckin stand up and look at life. Take it by the motha fuckin horns and grip it to the point where you can't hold no more. Stand up straight and take things as they come. 

GROW THE FUCK UP.

"event","Finally .. an update.

Me and Victor have been doing so amazingly well lately. Everything's fitting together .. like pieces of a puzzle .. no extras .. no empty spaces. I love him so much .. not a kiddie love .. not puppy love .. It's serious. He knows it. He feels it as well. It's so perfect.

Colleen. Hm. Yeah .. one of my best friends. At times .. I wondered if I saw her more, if I'd get sick of her? This proves that was a crazy thought of mine. 

Here's the story:

I introduced Colleen to Vic's cousin Tommy a while back. Tom and me went shopping one day at the King of Prussia mall, I had called up Coll to see what she was doing. She stopped by the mall with her friend Kelly and we all hung out for a little. Ended up leavin .. cus I felt like they didn't even wanna talk to eachother. Well, about a month later Colleen's name came up yet once again, and Tommy's like .. did I meet her? I said yeah, but it was brief. Well he went and got a hair cut [yaaay] and Colleen came down that night. We all ended up hanging at Vic's house, annnd they ended up really clickin, bigtime. Hooked up and all. It was good .. Colleen has this [geeky lil smile] on her face .. a face I haven't really seen before. It made me smile .. It made me think. I caught myself looking at her and tom .. watching their expressions. I then looked at Victor, smiled .. and held him so tight. [whispering i love you] in his ear. It feels so good to say that .. to mean it .. to watch him say it back .. with a soft kiss. It's amazing. Colleen left that night, and called tommy later that night. They talk a lot on the phone lol. She came down again the next day, and the next day, and yet again the next :-D I'm so happy to see her eachday. I love her, very much. And I'm loving to see her happy. It makes me happy, that she is. Her and Tom hit it off so unbelievably well. My dad had made a comment about it .. saying wouldn't it be funny if: Colleen married Tom, and Victor married me. Heh. Funny .. yet unexplainable. Well, I'm seeing them together in the near future. It just seems SO RIGHT.

Yesterday Colleen came and got me from work, and we headed straight to Tom's new house. [well tom and nikki's old house .. but now nikki's gone! yaay!] So tom, and victor are living together. Awesome'ness, there both super close now! YaaaY! They asked me last night if I wanted to move in. I was like, are you serious? They gave me that look .. and said yeah. Tom explained me and Vic can have the 2nd to biggest room .. and I'd pay half of what Vic pays. So instead of 300 .. it would be like 150 or so. Which I can definitly afford. No prob at all. SoOo I'm really thinking about it. Plus I'm still close to home. Its right in Sharon Hill .. Soooo maybe maybe maybe hm??? It's an idea alright. An idea that I'm excited about. I'm really happy lately .. It's great. 

Anywayyyyy I need to go get ready for work .. im workin for daveee tonight. Colleens likeee arghhhh I'm beating up dave and burning down modells! hehehehe. So yeah .. must go now. 

Have a good day everyone ..

"event","Hm. Friday yet again. Alone. Bored. Kinda sad. [sigh]

I'll be apologetic about not writing lately. I do kinda owe one. So sorry to the people who actually faithfully read this shit. [ha..]

Anyway..I just got off work, I'm pretty tired, so I guess I'm not going anywhere. I've got work tomorrow at 1:30 anyway. So a nice relaxing time at home..sounds good. Not. It's been horrible the last 2 days. Heres the down-low.

[x]Thursday[x]I had work and I was so sick. Something was wrong with my right side. I could hardly walk, was crying uncontrollably..and just minutes later, I had thrown up. Oddly...I threw up onions from the day before. Weird. So I had Shante' call Victor to see if he was available to come get me [i couldnt even talk on the phone] He was there in no time flat. I felt bad, he had to come from school. We ended up going back to my house, and he told me to put on sweat pants and we'd go back to his house. Well it was like 2:30-3 almost, and we ended up falling asleep....waking up at 9:00 at night. Hours later...We couldn't believe we slept that long. I got into my sweats and we headed to his house. Fell asleep fast...etc etc.

He had work the next morning, so I came home around 7'ish. My dad decided to do some Christmas shopping and asked me if I wanted to join him. I said yeah, why not, It should be fun. Well we went to head to the bank first, turned out my dad couldnt cash my grandfathers check....sheesh. Fuckin banks=stupid. We then headed to get some produce. We ended up forgetting the broccli. Soo we went home, and had to go back. We then headed to block jewelers to pick up my dads gf's gift. That was simple and stress-free. I wanted to check out chains for vic, butttt the bastards didnt have ""guy chains."" We were hungry by this point, but went to Kohl's to see if we could pick up a few things there. We checked out pillow cases for my grandpa, and went thru hell with that. Couldn't find shit. My dad got annoyed and aggervated so we left. We were pretty damn hungry by this point, so we headed to Wawa to pick up a hoagie and a bagel. The nearest one i knew of was off of providence road... Well once again, sumthin goes wrong. We pull up....and yeah...what the fuck happened to Wawa? We walk in and theres like hindu's everywhere...uhhh ok??? We get our shitty food...which yeah, was shit. And we headed home. Then I had work today [1-10] and that was hell as well. I worked with Dave...thank god. [hes the only guy friend ive got, that means so much..hes so great..thanx for everything]

Well now I'm home. And I'm bored out of my mind. Sad as well. Crying..Depressed, and don't know what to do with myself. I'm thinking just go to bed. Victor's over Tony's house...drinkin the night away. I hope he's having a good time....I can't sit here anymore. Goodnite. I hope you all have a nice weekend.



















I'm so sick n' tired of being the ""depressed one"" Its not fair."

So Friday [November 5th] was Louis's funeral. Ugh..I could'nt get myself to go. I just wasn't up for it, I couldn't sit there and look at him like that. I don't wanna say it was wrong..I'm just so upset and confused. It takes SO much courage to go and do something like that. There's been times where I've wanted to say goodbye to everything and just do it, but I could'nt. It's so upseting. I remeber going to the pool hall and hangin out with everyone..u'd hear Louis coming cause his damn system was soo freakin loud! This one time, colleen and I were at Lansdowne Wawa, and we ran into him...he tried to run me over with his blazer haha..then he gave me a piggie back ride all around wawa parking lot. Heh...Those memories will never go away. I'll never forget you, Louis...and neither will anyone else. You will be greatly missed. Your birthday is in 5 days....I want to give you your life back...and show you what you had.

Anywho...So Friday night a couple people from work were like, yeah were finally going to go to the Olive Garden for your birthday. So ya know, thats cool....plus I was wicked hungry. It was Jordan, Zo, Jackie and me. Everyone else who was supposed to go, didn't. Luckilly were all cool, and there were no weird feelings. So we went to the Olive Garden, and pigged out like crazy. I was wicked tired for some reason after that, so they dropped me off @ home. I walked in, said hi to Joe...and walked right upstairs to my room...tossed everrrrrything on the floor and slammed down....dood by morning, oh man, my neck hurt like fuckin shit.

So then Saturday hit, annnnnnnd I talked to colllleeen!! I asked her to gimme a call later on that day to maybe hang out, and she did :-D Sooo Colleen, tim, rob, and clay came down..we went to bennagins to eat...yum yum :-D then headed up King of Prusssssia to haaave fun. And whoa maaaan..indeed we did. We had a freaking blast. Too bad, I don't remember everything, but I'll try my best. So we decide to drink...and get frickin drunk. So we get Clay to go buy it for us, and let me remind you..its only like 5 something in the evening. So we get our shit..and head to tim's house to get some movies..then head to colleens. Begin to drink around 6. Lol..still light out haha. We were drunk by like 9.. we thought it was like 1 in the morning, and it was only like 10. It was so fuckin fun. I supposablly all night was tryng to ""hook up"" with colleen. Ha Ha. Whoa...I do remember a little...but I don't remember like begging or anything. Colleen ended up losing her cell phone [notttt good] she was flippin out..but laughing cause she was drunk. We searched everywhere for it. And being she dropped it a little b4 losing it...it turned off. So we couldnt even call it!!!! We went back to colleen's and almost passed out. Then colleen pulls out her popples dollie with a zip up back, and fuckin pulls out sum weeeeed lol. I was like wtff? hahaha. So they all decide to smoke..so we go across the street'ish and watch them do it. They cracked me the fuck up. I was too damn cold to do anything...plus I ddidn't really wanna smoke. Then headed back in coll's house and almost fell asleep again...tim and colleen popped a pill or something, but they were pills prescribed from a doc to help colleen with her sleep. Sooo they were FUUUUUUCKED up man. After a while...now its like 3-4 in the morning, me, tim, and rob head to tim's house and all fall asleep there. We left colleen...hm? Dood..i dont know.

Aren't you excited? You should be. Big 2-0. Sheeesh, where does the time go? I can't believe im 20 years old. I'm half-way to 40 people!!! That's not exciting. It's actually pretty scary if you think about it. Where's my life going? Do I have plans? I need to get my ass into gear. I spent the night at Victors house last night [what else is new] Anna [his neice] gave me these cute little ""happy bunny"" key chains. I love them...shes so great. Shes like ""I know it isn't much...but it's the thought right?"" I wanted to cry. Heh. We made love....unexplainable love. He gave me one gift before bed..which was a bigggg comforter blankie :-D I needed one..but I didn't think he'd go and buy one. Well he did! Heh...and it's ungodly comfy.....

He woke up for class...then came back home around 10:45'ish and gave me the rest of my gifts. I didn't expect all this...He got me a new duffle bag [needed one bigtime] and its blue and pretty. He got me the perfume I wanted, along with ear-rings..lots of new ones! Hoorah! Gifts...aren't that big of a deal to me. As long as I have my loved ones...thats all. All I need.

My daddie is having a cake for me tonight :-D I love just sitting with the family...I miss my dad. We haven't been spending as much time together as I want to be. So I'm going to make time for him. As well as others in my family.

So Colleen stopped by uh..yesterday. Man o Man..I can't say how good it was to see her. She didn't look too ""overall"" happy. But in good news, this chic got a new car. And I must say, It's decent. I'm lovin' it. Heh. Its a uh.. Mazda Prodeje hatchback [wow, i can't spell lol] Anyway, it's very nice, roomy, and a pretttty color :-D So I'm very happy for her. Victor was also over, and she claimed she felt weird with him there. I don't know why. He said he felt weird as well. Ugh, ya bunch of weirdos! Just shut up and conversate LOL. So yeah, I'm excited about like...I guess ""getting our friendship back into gear."" I can't lose her....shes a big part of my life. So yeah.

I got off work today early..like 4:30. YaaaaaaaaaaaaaY. So now I'm just pretty bored.

So, I guess your excited about hearing whats new. Well damn, where should I start? I don't even know if it's right to be writing about it on the computer. It's pretty personal, but eh, I need to write. And it's not like I can keep a written journal anymore...typing's easier :-D 

oOk. So here goes: 
Danielle is pregnant with her 2nd. [gasp..] She's so afraid. As well am I. I don't know what to do or say. I don't wanna sit there and critisize her, then again, I wanna be there for her..and tell her everything is going to be ok. Although..I have no idea whats in her future. I'm so scared for her. I love her to death, and would do ANYTHING for her. It just frustrates me that she does shit like this. She needs to just, look @ her priorities...UgH, I'm just going to be here for her...and just listen. And stay with her. Try to dig her out of this hole......

Lets see....what else.

Me and Vic are doing fabolous. Everythings.....amazing. Honestly...I've fallen. And I don't want to get back up. I want to stay Fallen. For Him. And only Him. I asked him....hypothetically..if he could spend the rest of his life with me..He looked @ me and said ""Yes."" I was like..hm, you answered that quick. He replied with...yes I know Ilia. Because I mean it. So yeppers. I really feel like he's the one. Yeah I said it :-O Whoa. Hm.

So thats ya know...whats going on as of this moment. I'm going to lay in the tub...I need to relax.

Unfortunatly, I'm emotional..and I really have to look on the optimistic side.....So well, Wednesday..yeah..we will prolly call my brother out of school, and dad will take a day off. I don't kno what is going on yet. All I know is, I'll be off from work. So yeah..enough of that..I'm getting all sad. AGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway..I was already pissed cause i saw Fisch's car..cause of what happened yesterday. 
[[[FLASHBACK of Yesterday]]] I had went into work to pick up my check..and I had steve, freddie, and and Mike waiting in the car..so to not keep them waiting, I thought, well, I don't need to cash it. So, I asked Tara to get it for me..and shes like ""its not in here..I think Fisch took it"" So I laughed, and said, ok well where did the bum go?? I told them to call him to the front..he didn't come up after 2 pages.. so I began to get pissed. Only because I had people waiting..So Bob [manager] passes by..and asked what was wrong. I said nothing, just trying to find Dan Fischetti. He asks why of course. I responded with, ""well he has my check [jokingly] and I kind of need it back"" Well I watched Bob go into the office, and I didn't think anything of it. Like two seconds later, I hear over the intercom ""Dan to the front, dan to the front please"" I was like, omg are you serious? Well he comes to the front, and like throws me my check, and calls me a baby and shit. I was like dude, I didn't ask Bob to call you to the front. And he had a fuckin attitude, so I just walked away. 
So I walked in work today, and saw Dan by himself..so I decided to go over and ask him if he was seriously mad at me. I got a pretty harsh response from the asshole. He looked at me and said ""ilia, just shut up..I don't wanna talk about it, It was so immature"" I'm like...are you fucking serious dude??? That was really messed up of him to do that. He didn't even want to take like a minute and hear my side....so fuck it. I let it go....and didn't worry about it. Thats a perfect example of why I got to get outa there. People like that. And to think... Me and Dan were cool...friends even. And..he goes and pulls a stunt like that....friends don't get all pissed and crazy like that. Friends listen to the other side of the story. Oh well...He'll either get over it..or keep a grudge. Do as you please. 

SoOoOoOoOoOoOo!!!!!!!!!!! Jordan and Little Dave were working... fortunatly.. people I like and get along with. Dave wasn't feeling too hot. I felt all bad for him. I don't like seein him sick..cause then he's all ""not cheery"" He He He. 

Anywho...work was dead today...so a super boring day it was. I closed with Big Dave and Steve...[god i wanna like..just take his voice box out] Ha. You have no idea....

Kelly called me near the end of the night..asking me if I wanted to hang out. I was totally up for it.....But!!!!!!!!!!! Getting around..yeah..No car [either of us] Yeah..losers lol. So we both tryed to find some guys to hang with, unfortunatly no ones around. Yeah, fuck you all. HA. Boyfriend and all his boys=down the shore..other friends..who knows. We ended up calling it a night, and forgetting about it. Saving it for another day. So yeah...

So now im home...bored outa my mind..on a saturday night. 

My brother had back pains..so I made him lay on the floor..and I walked on his back. Now he feels all super AND SHIT. So yeah...I AM A GOD. Thank you, Thank you. I should be a Massuse :-D

Maybe....I'll ring someone..and see if they will come over...just to hang. Ha..right. Im a puss.

Today was supposed to be a day of cleaning danielle & steve's house. So, that when her mom and Chal came home tomorrow from Cancun, they could come home to a nice, clean house. Well, today was so stressful. Instead of it being fun, and jammin to music and such..it ended up being a day of arguments AND SHIT. Everyone should of just shut up..and just did their own thing. Anyway, we got the house clean..and man O man does it look amazing! Looks so different [and thats a good thing]

So I left there around 8 or so, and here I am. Sitting here on this uncomfortable chair. Staring at the pooter, waiting for something interesting to happen. But, nothing will. Like always. 

I've got spongebob socks on..bought them from my work [wahoo] 

Johnny Cash....I've been everywhere...Great song..[need to learn the words.. then I'd be the shit] InDeEd..

Vic's still down the shore...Ugh. I don't know why I miss him so damn much. I'm sitting here, trying to find something to do, just to get him off my damn mind LOL. Pathetic. God!!!!!! Our relationship...I really feel it getting closer. It's going so well. I'm actually...REALLY happy with this one!

So yeah..Everything else is going O.K I guess. Can't really complain. Although, I feel as if I freaked Dave out. It really sucks. I should of never frigin mentioned that shit to him. It pisses me off..I'm so stupid. I don't stop & think. Anyway...Ugh

Still sitting here....God I feel like I can write for hours. This sucks. Im unbelieveably bored. Am I a loser or what?? GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!

Well...I guess I'm going to sit upstairs in the bedroom. Doing nothing. Ring Me.

Last night when I got home from work, I called Vic and he said he was going to come pick me up during Half Time [eagles game] So while I was waiting, I keyed up Dave cause I needed to talk to him about something. Well we didn't get far with the conversation cause my nextel works like shit in my house. So it was a long 20 minutes of..Hello? What? What did u say? Im sorry..huh? Grrrr.

Anyway..Vic came and got me..we headed back to his house to watch the last like...hour of the game. Tommy and Scott were downstairs. Once again..reeeeking of weed. Gross.

So yeah, it's what..? 8:30 in the AM. Ugh..Anywho Its Monday and I've got work at 1:30. So fortunatly I have a few hours to relax. I had a pretty decent weekend. Starting with Friday and my drunkeness with the boys. 

Then Saturday night..I closed [for zo ehem!!!] and Brenda ended up giving me a ride home. Well Vic called me and he's like yeah..invite your Kelly friend out. So Brenda drove us to Kelly's house to tell her parents she was staying at my house for the night, and for them to pick her up in the morning for work. I thought this was going to be a piece of cake. A Ha. No. Not at all. Her parents are like..My God. Get a freakin clue. Have some fun. Man O Man. They were the worst parents ever. I would prolly of ran away if I were her. She moved her from Allentown..and well her parents are all strict and shit. I mean c'mon..its not that bad of a neighborhood. Do I look all beat up and shit? Relax people!!!! Relax!!! So her dads a real asshole..asking me for all this information and shit. I dont mind a phone number..but damn man..get off my case. I feel so bad for her...shes got it pretty rough. 

The ended up telling her that she couldnt go..She started flipping out [u go girl] You know..the bullshit speech. Well finally they gave in..let her out..although she had to be in by 12. Sheeeeesh!!! We headed back to my house, got all ready..and Vic came to get us. Yaaaay Mah Bebe :-D Off to Tony's house we went. Get a little drink drink on. Kelly is a really nice girl too. I told her my first impression of her..and well, i indeed do take it back. Shes a great person. Smart too :-D So as the conversations are flowing..we remembered tony has to show her his bannnnngin ass truck! A Dodge Durango..i dont know how to spell it...Ughhh. Its a real nice tho.

So yeah..the truck..was indeed a hit. Ha. Go Tony!! So were all sittin in what I like to call the ""the truth comes out"" room. Well because..the truth most of the time..comes out in there. [pauses..wow] Ha. So its Tony, Vic, Ed, Kelly, and me. Snappin pics.. drinkin.. talkin..same old. So Kelly ends up leaving..and they call her a little while later..Asking her to get with me. Oh My :-O Odd part..she didnt say No :-\ ????????? Oh Man. Things are getting weird.

Then get this!!!!!!!!!!!!! Argh. Im at that point right, where I know whats going on..but im like all tipsy or what not. And Vic is like..I'm gonna call some people. Sure whatever..go ahead. Well he calls Colleen..Ok thats cool..sure. I dont know what the hell time it is...and well he puts her on speakerphone, and hes all telling her about how I lost my virginity to him. Jebus Vic!! I was gonna tell her myself u big PooP. So I read her Xanga from the weekend and its all: ahh ilias boyfriend called me all drunk and shit. Dood..my bad. God! Anyway.

Sunday morning comes around...we got to sleep in!!! OMG! Amazing.. pure amazing. Loved every moment of looking at that clock reading past 11!!!!!!! We then headed to ""Mings Resturant."" Excellent little cute movie place. Good Good food. Even tho all I got was a grilled ham and cheese sandwhich :-D yum..I got the evil eye from Vic hehehehe. After we finished we headed to my house to change for the Mall. Thought wed do some shopping. ENNNNNNNNT WRONG ANSWER! My little friend decided to ruin my day. Yes the bitch did. Fuckin (->.<-) Yes a period. Get it? We had to leave G-Run Mall cus the pain was so unbearing :-( It was awful. I hated myself. Grr. Heading back to the house we went. Poo.

"event","[ohhhhhhhhhh] Good morning people. This is my first entry of LJ. I had xanga..but realized that it sucked..AND SHIT. I'm really tired. I didn't get much sleep last night..Or maybe I did..Just didn't feel like it. I had a lot on my mind as well. Yesterday was a pretty decent day though. I had off from work [yaaaay] So I decided to make it a ""cleaning"" day. [Feels forhead..] Was I sick? Ha Ha. Anywho..So I cleaned away..vacumning and such. Then decided hey..I'll cook dinner tonight. So I called my dad and told him the plan..and made sure we were going to eat as a family for once lol. It hasn't happened in a while. So it was really nice. I made filet mignon/marinated onions, mashed topatoes :-D green beans, baked beans. It was Yummy. Very very yummy.

So after dinner...Joe helped me make this LJ thing...and I kept getting frigin annoyed cause I didn't understand it at points. I get aggervated easily. After being all tired out from staring at the pooter screen..I was debating whether to go to bed. [KNOCK KNOCK] oO? It's like 9 something at night..Who would be knocking??? Joe answered the door..ended up being Victor. I was really happy to see him..yet so drained. He was a mess!!! Which is why he didn't come inside. Respectable. Heh. He couldn't find his phone..so It was cute of him to just stop by :-D So I got showered up and such..and headed out to the car. I felt bad, I took forever. He feel asleep in the car :-( Poor Baby. So we headed back to his house, and I sat there in the living room with his sister Yvonne. The movie ""Underworld"" was on. I had never seen it..So I decided to watch it with her. I was really lost, cause its one of those movies, you have to see from the beginning. It was a good movie from what I saw though. After that ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" came on. She said it was a funny movie...so me and vic watched it..cause she had her company over.

I really enjoyed the movie. It really made me think though. It was based on the main character ""Josh Hartnett"" giving up something he loves or craves. Lent, is what its called. He ended up giving up sex, masturbation, and sexual activity for 40 days and 40 nights. Difficult..for him. One part of the movie, Vic looked at me, and said ""see ilia..this is what you put me through"" And i was like??? What the fuck? What do you mean? Well meaning sex of course. I was like..oh man, here we go. It is indeed all about sex isn't it? So after the movie..we went downstairs and talked for a while. About everything... feelings, sex, our relationship and such. I just feel it becoming so strong..everything..so amazing. My dad asked me if I could see myself spending the rest of my life with him...Thats kind of an early question I think. I don't think I am ready for answer something like that. Although...I dont know...I'm not saying anything yet!!!!! Well..I'm hungry...and I've got work at 1:30. So maybe I'll go eat brunch..and get ready for the hell hole. Waahoo!!

LJ better be more exciting then XANGA..or I'm opening a can of Whoop-Ass on someone. So watch your back homies :-O

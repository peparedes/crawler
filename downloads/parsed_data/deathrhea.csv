"event","Today was good. Physics was a blast! Nat and I measured two routes to Coach Casey's room (actually Coach Casey's desk). We literally walked in in the middle of class. The juniors all thought it was funny. On guy said, ""thats the most random thing I've ever seen in my life."" haha. I have a quiz in stat tomorrow, but before I can do my homework I have to get a graphing calculator. I lifted weights again in personal fitness- I'm pumping 70 lbs- over half my body weight! I'm just glad we didn't have to run like yesturday. Spanish was boring as usual. Lunch was fun. Chorus was.. interesting. I don't like loud tone-deaf people singing in my ear!  Deep River is amazing, though. 
AP Lit was awesome. We shared our imitated sentences. I still have 3 journal entries to catch up on- not including tonights. I haven't spent HOURS thinking about it.. haha. One of my topics will be about my standards for guys I date- that will be interesting. Your's was great, Richard! Stick to your standards no matter what! They are wonderful! Anyway.. I just remembered I have to turn in my senior picture for the yearbook. There is only one really good one out of all of them-so this is muy importante.

THIS IS THE OFFICIAL REMINDER: FCA is in the morning at 7:30 in the auditorium! I'll see you there Kevin, Kara and Sammy! 

Thats it for tonight. I hope everyone else had a good day. Remember: Tomorrow is FRIDAY!!

"event","I just found this really great article in my Brio Magazine that I know several of you will enjoy. Just a warning to the guys: this is very girly. Unless you can't stand the suspense, don't read it. 
This article is very long (and I typed all of it), but it is so cute and well worthy of reading! Its a refreshing change from the beyond-boring summer reading books! Please leave comments to tell me if you liked it or not! :-)

The Princess Wish- by Grace M. Dove

Guys calls movies such as The Princess Brides, Ever After, and The Princess Diaries ""click flicks"" because teen girls love to repeatedly watch them. Even certain stories such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White captivate little girls' hearts.
In all these stories the heroine is a princess (or eventually becomes one), and girls want to identify with her. They dream of how exquisite it must be to live as a princess, with sparkling tiaras, gorgeous gowns and grand balls, especially when a handsome prince is involved.
More than just wishing to look like a princess, girls wish they could be one because there's something special about the demeanor of a princess. Every princess story shows that it takes more than dazzling attire to gain the admiration of a prince.
There's good news. Every teen girl who belongs to the Lord Jesus is a princess! But the sad new is that not every princess realizes she is one. Those who don't know aren't as likely to think or act like royalty.
So, how does a princess act? What qualities should a young maiden have to catch the eye of a prince? Lets take a look at waht a princess should be.

Noble~

A princess is a noble young lady who carries herself with poise and dignity. She listens attentively. and when she speaks, she carefully chooses her words. She exercises control over her emotions and makes choices based on what's right rather than on what she feels.
As she's faces with temptation, she makes choices that reveal her strength and character. Though she isn't perfect, she possesses a strong sense of duty that comes with knowing she's a princess. ""A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies"" (Provervs 31:10).

Selfless~

A princess thinkgs of others. In the mmovie Ever After, Danielle displays this when the rpince tosses gold coins to her in exchange for the use of her horse. Instead of taking the money for herself, she uses the coins to redeem an old man who was sold into slavery. Though this young lady isn't yet a princess, she exibits the qualities of one. Her selfless act leads her to the path of the prince. 

Humble~

Another princess virtue is humility. She doesn't demand or expect special treatment from others and chooses to refrian from bragging or boasting. Instead, she focuses on others and their needs. She doesn't have to be in the spotlight because she already knows she's a princess.
Her humility is shown as she seeks and accepts advice. A wonderful example of this is in the book of Esther in the Bible. Esther's willingness to seek advice placed her in the coveted position of the queen.
Even as queen, she humbled herself by listening to the counsel of her cousin. This attitude eventually saved her life and the lives of her people. Its a fabulous story of drama, excitement and romance. And its true!

Kind~

A princess is extraordinarily beneficent. Gentle, generous, good natured, and forgiving are all words to describe a princess. Remember Snow White's gentleness as she sings among the birds and animals? Or her soothing sense of humor when dealing with the shenanigans caused by the seven dwarfs?
When Cinderella is mistreated, she doesn't become mean-spirited or vindictive. She doesn't try to get even, but patiently endures. Though she sheds tears, we know Cinderella's virtue is rewarded with attending the ball

Trusting and Faithful~

A princess believes and trusts. In The Princess Bride, when Buttercup thinks her hero, Westley, is dead but then sees him arrive on the scene again, the maiden promises to believe he'll always return. Her faith is severely tested by ill-intentioned people who lie about her hero. If she chose to believe them, she'd have lost everything. But she trusts, and her rpince eventually returns to rescue her.
As for Cinderella, she's tested further by Prince Charming in order to be faithful to a promise. However, a princess is a princess regardless of her attire or her circumstances, and in the end, Cinderella regains her lost glass slipper and the arms of her prince.

Respectable and Admirable~

A princess doesn't compete with a prince. Just the opposite, she builds him up. It's her admiration and respect that inspire the prince and compel him to greatness. When he sees that he's a hero in her eyes, its no wonder he's willing to suffer for her. A hero will go through anything to keep an admiring princess by his side.
These qualities of a princess from long ago are still the virtues that attract a prince today. And they're already yours. If you're a daughter of the King, these graces are your royal heritage. Like Mia in the Princess Diaries, all you need to do is practice them through the power of the Holy Spirit. Its not just a wish or a fairy tale, it's the wonderful TRUTH!

*This is a sidenote the author wrote*
Last summer two teen girls stayed with our family while they attended a youth conference. Because I'm a mother of all boys, I had a great time doing things with our guests. When we went to the mall, we had fun ""ooh-ing and ahh-ing"" over tiaras we spotted in a store window. We laughed as each of us admitted that we wished we had one.
I secretly returned to that store and selected two tiaras  as a suprise gift for the girls to open during their flight home. I wrapped them in delicate pink paper, along with the following letter:

Dear Princess,
I bought this tiara for you from the shop where we gazed longingly through the window. Its my gift to remind you that you are a princess.
So....
No matter how you're feeling, let this tiarabe a reminder to pray to your Father, the King of heaven and earth. He loves to her His daughter's voice! Talk to Him about everything.
When you feel like rebelling or indulging  in other questionable behavior, remember your crown and ask yourself, ""is this the conduct of a princess?""
And when guys come around, your tiara is a reminder to ask yourself, ""is he a prince?"". Remember that the King wants a prince to give his daughter, so don't waste your time (or kisses) on ""frogs""!


I thought that would be an enjoyable article for ya'll. We've all wanted to be a princess at some point. :-)
From one princess to another- I bid you goodnight. (since its really only 7 pm in Hawaii!)

Adeiu!"

"event","Well.. I am back from Hawaii!! It was awesome! It was a little different from what I expected- and surprisingly I only got a few days on the beach. All in all it was awesome! This is what I did:
- went on a submarine 120 ft in the ocean
- went to a luau and native dance show
- went to Wakiki Beach
- hiked 2 miles over volcanic ash in the dark
- explored a pitch-black lava tube
- saw a volcano erupting into the ocean
- stayed at a Chalet
- read Wuthering Heights
- went down an awesome water slide
- watched many beautiful sunsets
- saw beautiful waterfalls
- hiked through a rainforest
- hiked through volcanic wasteland
- saw ""The Grand Canyon of the Pacific""
- saw hundreds of chickens wandering around Kau'i!
- ran into friends from Virginia at Wal-Mart
- visited Pearl Harbor
- went snorkeling
- babysat my cousins
- stayed at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel (everything is pink)
- went shopping in downtown Honolulu

That sums up the major things I did. Right now I am very jet-lagged since Hawaii is 6 hours behind us, so I'm getting Chick-Fil-A and then relaxing for the rest of the day. Tomorrow I have to start on the cram to get my summer work done!!
I am looking forward to seeing you all- hopefully before school starts- but if not- see ya August 9th! Thats all for now!"

Well aloha and aloha- I am headed off to Hawaii until the end of the month! I promise to send everyone postcards!!

"event","Today has been nice and lazy. The only real activity I have done are senior pictures! Thye were soooo fun! I loved playing model. From what I saw, there are some really good pictures. I found the drape-things and the ""tuxes"" very amusing. The thing the girls have to wear is this velveteen piece of material with a hole at the top- its funny. the tuxes are even better. The shirts have no sleeves, and the bowties are velcroed to the shirt collar. All in all- it was an awesome experience! I have trouble not-smiling, though! haha- as I was leaving I saw Susan and while my mom was waiting she got to know the mom of this guy, Michael who goes to Northview. I don't know him- he hasn't taken any APs I don't think. Now I am anxious to get the pictures back! :-)
Anyway- since I haven't gotten anything accomplished today, I've got to work extra hard tomorrow getting my room in shape to leave. It won't take too long- (I just like taking extended ""breaks""). I will be done by 6:00 promptly so I can get food and go see ""The Notebook"". It'll be fun! Anyway, I'd better conclude- my family is going to either McAlisters or Roasters as soon as my dad gets home! see ya!

"event","haha- I cut almost half my finger off. Never use scissors when trying to remove staples form a bulletin board! Theres not been much going on around here the past couple of days. We ended up going to Birmingham for DB's 70th birthday (my parents both had him for acapella choir at Samford and he was a good friend of my grandaddy). It was fun- but I don't think anything is worth it when you have to drive for 3 hours to and from and only spend 2 hours at the actual party. I met a lot of my parent's old college friends- they are so cool. Its fun to think of my parents as they were in college. I met a couple with twin 17-year-old boys who are on a mission trip to Africa! I would love to go to Africa on a mission trip. Their mom was saying that both of them feel a strong calling to the ministry and they're probably going to Samford! How cool! Its so cool to know of guys like that- just to be brothers in Christ. Anyway, Mary and Dad ate some bad meat at Wendy's and both got sick on the return journey. Lovely! I'm glad I got chicken! hehe
Well- I have to go clean my room.
I have senior pictures at 1:30 tomorrow! yikes!

I almost forgot- my pastor preached a sermon about being the salt and light of the world and about how dangerous relativism and post-modernism are- believing there is no absolute truth. I don't think I've ever been so captivated by a sermon before ever! He was also talking about how  ""being different"" is the politically correct term used, and how when you say ""you're wrong"" to someone it is politically incorrect. Did you know that a the mayor of London, Canada (I think thats the town) got fined $10,000 because he read the verse in the Bible condemning homosexuality! Canada is right next door, people!
Wednesday, an Amendment to the Constitution is being proposed in the Senate. An amendment that generally states this: ""Marriage in the United States of America is to be between one MAN and one WOMAN"". The scary reality is that as ""well.. duh"" a statement as that sounds, and even though the majority of the people of the United States are in support of this statement- this amendment proposal will fail because of lack of support in the screwball, liberal, doesn't-use-their-brain, corrupt nothern states. Fortunately our Senators are voting ""yes""- but it should disturb each of us that the men and women sitting in the sacred Senate chamber are saying ""no"" when the people (whom I thought the government was for) are screaming a resounding ""YES!""- never mind the issue.
The problem is that we don't want to offend anyone. I am definitely guilty of this. Right now, I don't care if what I'm writing offends you, because we are the next generation of leaders and someone has got to say it! From the looks of things so far- things are looking pretty bleak, I'm sad to say. We are a generation of relativism. Relativism denies the existence of absolute truth. For example: ""Its ok that I stole food because I was hungry"" and ""Its ok that I had an abortion because I got raped."" People can justify anything like that. 
In 50 years, looking back on this marriage issue, our grandchildren will say one of 2 things.
1- Wow- 2004 was one of the closest crisis' we've ever been in. I'm so glad you stood up for what is right. or
2- Social Security is gone. The institution of the family is gone. All other ""special"" groups are clammoring for rights- like polygamy. You were there at the start of all this. Why didn't you do something?

"event","King Arthur was great! The ending was a little disappointing, because you wait the whole time through all the battle sequences, and they don't even elaborate on the story after Arthur and Gwenivere get married. the love story is played down a lot. I suppose its because this is the ""real story"" and they want to get away from the legend as much as possible. The whole thing was good, though. King Arthur's character was awesome- Lancelot wasn't really that great, which is odd b/c people tend to cheer for Lancelot instead of Arthur. I cried (of course).I suggest going to see a matinee show, b/c I had dreams of all the battles all night- thus I did not sleep well. Anyway- enough of my movie reviews.

I have actually gotten quite a bit accomplished today. I got up at 8:45. We left for Mary's dermatology appointment at 10:50 and couldn't find it, so we were late (as always). After that we picked up lunch at Chick-Fil-A and ate it on the porch w/ him. It was fun. After that we went to Cargo Kids and got Mary an organizer/shelf thingy, picked up my curtain thingys at Karen's fabric, and then picked up my sheers at Linens N Things.

The sun is shining brightly (something I didn't see at all while camping). I got up at a semi-decent hour this morning and ate a bag of potato chips for breakfast. hehe. 
Around 10:30 a lady came to paint daisies on Mary's wall. Ohh- a daisy is not a flower- its a weed. Weeds are corrupted and kill flowers! Aghh!! I haven't seen them yet, but Mom and Mary absolutely love them. I have been talking on AIM and printing off Asian recipes. I've always wanted to cook Asian dishes for a change from the stuff we eat all the time. We'll see if these recipes are successful. Later I am going to the pool with some friends. Sometime today I hope to read some of my required reading list. It seems that every other book is appealing simply because I am not being FORCED to read it. I have read 3 Chronicles of Narnia books, ""Redeeming Love"", ""The Hawk and the Jewel"", and ""An Echo in the Darkness"". As Kara pointed out, there are only 4 weeks of summer left! Aghh!!

I didn't like the driving, however. It took forever!! The campsite was beautiful and we got to do some good hiking in the mountains. We almost got caught in a thunderstorm. haha- I almost wanted to. Its wierd- I've known Ginny since I was three weeks old. It was so fun to catch up! Our dads are very alike- it is scary. They both make sound effects and go into deep conversations about science and theology. I wouldn't trade my dad for the world, though. This morning they blared ""Cool Water"" (with Daffy Duck singing it) for all the campsite to hear in an attempt to get Ginny and me up. We laughed at them. hahaha. Overall, I had a blast and am really glad I went.
This week should be fun. Tomorrow I am doing absolutely NOTHING (if I can help it). Wednesday- someone *hehe* is coming over to put out our pinestraw and edge our flowerbeds. Dad doesn't have time and this person is strong and has worked at Pikes. I hope I don't act stupid. That reminds me- I need to call Catherine. They are going to DC for their family vacation Saturday. :( We missed each other by a week. Thursday I get my hair trimmed and have tenative plans. The big debate this weekend is whether or not to go to DB's birthday in Birmingham. I'd like to go, but we'll see. Next Wednesday we are heading out to HAWAII!!

Having bad days helps me appreciate the good ones a lot more. It probably doesn't help that I am physically, emotionally, and spiritually exhausted. Enough whining.
Happier things. Shrek 2 last night was loads and loads of fun. It was Kevin, Mo, Kara, Jess, Michelle, Sherry, John, Angela, and me. It was so good to see John and Angela back from China. I know they had a blast!! Shrek 2 was also awesome the third time around (hehe). I love it, though. Each time I notice more things. It was fun pigging out on popcorn (I promise that thing was NOT a medium) and coke. A movie I am going to see (with some of my GIRL friends- hehe) is Princess Diaries 2. Chick Flicks are awesome! I still am going to see The Notebook and Spiderman 2. A movie I am NOT going to go see is The Spongebob Squarepants movie. haha- my IQ literally drops every time I even see the previews.

Ok.. my goal is to study really hard so I can get my PERMIT on Saturday morning. Its my dad's father's day gift. haha!! I really just want to be able to drive in Paducah. hehe
Anyway, thats all for now!"

Kennesaw has an incredibly low price, Furman looks good but is e mae as Samford except more expensive, Palm Beach Atlantic is too far and I'm not sure I want to go to school in Florida. Everything seems to be pointing at Samford. Life is very interesting in that way. If I'm supposed to be there, God will work everything out. I just have to keep telling myself that. :)
My work at Vacation Bible School continued today. I really like the teachers I am working under. I am fascinated with some of the things I am learning about Japan. Not that I want to be Japanese or anything, I just am developing a heart for the people and the land. Maybe I'll get to go there someday. I learned how to write ""Jesus"", ""love"", and ""forgive"" in Japanese. I am hoping to get faster. Writing in Japanese is like drawing a picture. I am even more excited to see some of the Japanese influence in Hawaii. I have decided that when I have a house of my own I want a garden with a bridge and a pond in it. 
I have the theme song stuck in my head.
Far Out, Far East
Rickshaw Rally, racing to the Son
Far Out, Far East

It will be so fun,
racing to the Son.

hehe. Ironically our Choir Tour theme was ""Sailing to the Son""-hmmmm.. someone was really creative when they came up with that. haha

Young Woman: ""I am the rose of Sharon, the lily of the valley.""

Young Man: ""yes, compared to other women, my beloved is like a lily among thorns.
Rise up, my beloved, my fair one, and come away. For the winter is past, and the rain is over and gone. The flowers are springing up, and the time of singing birds has come, even the cooing of turtledoves. Yes, spring is here! Arise, my beloved, my fair one and come away.""

Young Woman: ""Place me like a seal over your heart, or like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, and its jealousy is as enduring as the grave. Love flashes like fire, the brightest kind of flame. Many waters cannot quench love; neither can rivers drown it.""

It is not bad to be a hopeless romantic. But it is bad when thoughts of love that you do not posses yet consume you. Everything will happen in GOD'S perfect timing. Only through the Master of Love can we find true love- which He guarantees will be everything we hoped for. In the meantime, we must trust that he knows us better than we know ourselves. God chooses best for those who let him choose.
Just felt inclined to say that. Its been on my mind lately."

I am looking forward to the wonderful friendship and fellowship Tour brings. Thursday night is the full choir rehearsal. We leave on Saturday morning at 6:00 am. I still have a few things I must get.
We really do live in a despicable world. Rome = America today. It is really scary. We need to take a lesson from exactly why it fell. Sex with anyone and everyone before marriage, homosexuality, acceptance of everything, drugs, ""do whatever makes you happy"". The Bible may seem like a rule book, but there is a reason for those rules. Avoiding that stuff escapes so many consequences. ""An Echo in the Darkness"" is a perfect example of that.
Stuff to do today: go to the bookcase shop, Target, Read It Again.
Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable- it anything is excellent or praiseworthy- think about such things."

I got it Sunday and I've read all 500 pages over the tpast day and a half! It is soo sweet. I rarely cry in books, but I did in this one.
God is so awesome!! Its strange, but by reading Christian fiction, its like a way of spending time with Him. Its very cool. Kara and I had a theological discussion last night at 1:00 am. It was very interesting. I hate it when people in one denomination tell someone in another tell them they are wrong. Its stupid. You use the Bible and explain and reason things out. I guess its easy for me. Baptist is the closest denomination to the Bible, which is good b/c the Bible is absolute truth. 
I am frustrated because the other book I checked out is in Dad's car and Dad's car is at the airport. haha.. Mom says I have other things to do than read. I made a list of everything I need for Choir Tour, and I think we're going to go shopping today. yay!!

I'm really glad I got to go.
I am definitely going there again sometime- maybe for a family night out or something. 
I am finally beginning to get motivated about summer reading. I am making notes on Wuthering Heights, and all the fun stuff that goes with it. Tomorrow I am going to Barnes and Noble with Dad to get the other books while he gets the ""official tourist guide to Hawaii"". hehe

2) David is taken to Andersonville Prison. The war ends and Sarah finds him almost dead. She nurses him back to health.

I really need to get on a normal schedule. I didn't go to bed until 2 (this morning.. I guess) simply because I wasn't tired. I slept in until 11 this morning and I am still tired! I feel so useless and that I am wasting precious days. I have had way too much time to think. That is one of the problems with summer. I'm not sure about anything except my faith anymore. That sounds worse than it really is- it really only pertains to one thing. God is in control. 
In the meantime, college is looming over me. I have no idea why. I guess I'm just in that time of uncertainty, but I honestly feel that I am supposed to go to Samford. I will probably apply several other places as well, but I am not sure what those other places will be yet. My future is ahead of me- so bright and shining.

"event","I finished it!! Reedeming love is the greatest love story I have ever heard of! It is just like Moulin Rouge with one VERY VERY important difference. It never shows Satine struggle with all the horrible filth and unworthiness felf that follows a life of prostitution. Moulin Rouge preaches ""all you need is love"". That is true, but what is love? Is it wrapped up in emotion? yes. But, emotions fluctuate on a daily basis. Therefore, it is also a commitment. What is the source of all love?
   ""California's gold country, 1850. A time when men sold their souls for a bag of gold and women sold their bodies for a place to sleep. Angel expects nothing from men but betrayal. Sold into prostitution as a child, she survives by keeping her hatred alive. And what she hates the most are the men who use her, leaving her empty and dead inside. 
Then she meets Michael Hosea.
As man who seeks his Father's heart in everything, Michael Hosea obeys God's call to marry Angel and to love her unconditionally. Slowly, day by day, he defies Angel's every bitter expectation until, despite her resistance, her frozen heart begins to thaw. But with her unexpected softening come overwhelming feelings of unworthiness and fear. And so Angel runs. BAck to the darkness, away from her husband's pursuing love, terrified of the truth she can no longer deny: Her final healing must come from the One who loves her even more than Michael Hosea does... the One who will never let her go.""

Its based on the Biblical story of Hosea. For anyone who loves romance or Moulin Rouge- a definite must-read.
Wow.. I can't believe I'm advertising books in my livejournal. haha.

Anyway, Mary has decided she is going to re-decorate her room. It is going to be realy cute. The main colors are going to be a soft yellow and green and white. I'm going to finally paint my room pink and get my canopies hung over my beds. I love summer! All for now!"

Right now, however, I am just focusing on making it through finals! ahhhh!!
Today Richard and I performed ""Somewhere""! I thought it sounded really good- and everyone else liked it, so I guess thats all that really matters. We had an audience this morning when we practiced w/ Ms. Moras for the first time. Elle played and sang ""Barcelona"", and BLT was waiting to accompany this girl in Advanced Women. I think it helped to practice in front of them- i was much more nervous (because ""nervouser"" is not a word) this morning than I was at the actual performance. 
Anyway, the rest of the day was really boring- especially Spanish.

"event","Today has been very full! The AP US Test is over! It was not nearly as bad as I had anticipated, I just hope Bio goes the same way. We didn't start until 8:20, though, so we got out at 12:20. I don't think any 4 hours in my life have passed as quickly as they did today. I was pleased with the test, though. I know I at least got a 3.
After the exam, Mo, Mom and I went to McAlisters- yum! I must have been really hungry because I ate a bowl of French Onion Soup and an entire giant cheese spud.
Mom left for Paducah as soon as Mary got home, so its just me, Dad and Mary this weekend. I am sooo glad there is nothing wrong with Grandmommy's heart!
Dad came home early and we went to see the 4:15 showing of ""Ella Enchanted"". My new favorite movie! I absolutley love it!!!
The Chattachoochee Recreation area was fun, too. I am so glad I wore pants so I didn't get poison ivy. Note to self: NEVER go on a riverbank trail in heels! :)
Tomorrow: studying for Bio, going hiking, and going tubing in North Georgia mountains! It'll be fun!

Adios-
Elizabeth"

Maria: Theres a time for us, 
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare,
Time to learn, 
time to care..

Tony....

Maria: We'll find a way of forgiving
somewhere

Both: There's a place for us,
a time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
someday
somewhere

Yay! My dad finally remembered to pick up the music! The next few steps will be 1) learning the words, 2) practicing!! 3) praticing with the accompaniment

I am sooooooooooooo loaded down with schoolwork!!
I have 2 tests tomorrow and the AP US exam Friday! I am also frustrated because the site containing my cram packet is ""temporarily unavailable"". I haven't felt like myself latly."

"event","I am taking a break from writing my research paper on Thomas Edison.I've been working on it ever since I got home. If I had more time, I might have actually enjoyed doing it. However, it is due tomorrow, and I still have to devote some time studying for the AP US exam on Friday. It really has sneaked up on me! This entire year has seemed to drag on and on, and now that its almost over, it doesn't seem natural. Hark the Herald Angels shout- 13 more days till we get out!!
Did you know that Thomas Edison was almost entirely deaf? Maybe thats how he could concentrate for such long periods of time. 

My paper is going to start out with this quote I find to be very cool-
""Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up""
(Guess who said that)

Anyway, I can fell my brain slowly turning to mush inside my head, so I'd better write my research paper before its too late."

"event","Today has been gray and drizzly, thus I have been tired all day. Dad directed the music this morning at church, which is always exciting. This weekend was DiscipleNow for my church, so all the youth (except me, cuz I didn't go- dumb APs) went to Sunday school first, when I was in the service, and when we normally had Sunday school, everyone went to the service. Thus, I got to sit through 2 services!! The same service- I might add. It really wasn't that bad, though. The second service was a lot more animated, and everyone seemed so excited for some reason. Its always interesting to hear how the sermons are different and alike. :) Oh, in the first service, Craig Davenport and Melissa Forrister's little sister, came forward to tell the church they accepted Jesus. It was soo cool! I don't think any of Craig's family knew he was going to come forward this morning, he just went, and his parents followed him. Mrs. Davenport was so happy, she was almost crying. The Davenports are soo cool. Mr. Davenport joked about my books- and, true to my word, I restrained from getting the sequel to the book I just finished. Once school is out, I will. 
We went to Bugaboo Creek steakhouse for lunch- I am addicted to steak! I really need to stop eating it so much- I don't want to die of a heart attack! (thats a lovely thought). I went to ensemble this afternoon, where I got to sing my, ""Georgia on My Mind"" solo- fun stuff. Now I am here, trying to be patient- I need to work on that. In ten minutes I'm going downstairs and watching Big Fish.
Hope everyone had a good weekend!

Adios
Elizabeth"

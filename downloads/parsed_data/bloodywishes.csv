i love this feeling. when know one can touch me . a care free feeling that i wish could last forever. im so untouchable right now. Nothing can bother me. i finally started living in the present , not in the past. its a brand new thing im doing and it feels great. its still hard to block out somethings and its hard to get over things and realized new things..... but in the end im living in now and what i want my future to be. fuck them bitches is phrase most should live by. if you dont like me SHUT THE FUCK UP i dont want to hear why, i dont care. if you dont like me pretend i dont exisit, dont waste your precious time on trying to make me feel bad or harrass me I REALLY DONT CARE. chances are i hate you to so, go away. school is a waste of time yes, i go their to learn and get shit done , not to be sucked into pointless drama. school is a place to make accomplishments and maybe make a few friends on the way, i never wanted to go to high school or anyschoool for that fact, because i saw from older siblings and friends what it does..... its such a waste of time i wish i could just sit on a computer get my work done then go see peoepl i want to see and do things i want to do.............

anyways

new years was awesome. G*N*G i love all of you so much, it feels like iv gotten closer to all of you. i love you"

ive been doing a lot of thinking since i'v been up here, and iv made a a decision to stay and finish my jr year here then possibly go back my sr. year but no promises. i feel the need to be drama free for a permanant time. so ill be keeping in touch with all of you. this isnt a sure thing yet since i would terribly miss 2 people back home to death (julie and casey<3) but i really dont know, maybe itll turn out just to be a thought or maybe realtity.



i love you all,
peace<3

Song For Kelly Huckaby 

Photographs of the best time you had, 
windows smugded by the speed. 
Leaving home with our bags from Iron Street, 
as morning turned into California, 
And smoke trailed from the butt of my cigarette. 
Our glass house it threw rocks at all those it past. 

Waking up to the sound of 5 A.M. to take my turn at the wheel. 
Climbed up Shasta, oh how the engine ached 
as the sun tortured California, 
and old alleys turned deep at the heart of me. 
Murals of heros defacing the blank concrete.

Vision tunneled, Mission Street, hunger beat 
lodged out as the engine wheezed. 
Still moving regardless of stable ground 
and this stable ground.

Photographs of the best time you had, 
windows smugded by the speed. 
Leaving home with our bags from Iron street 
as morning turned into California.

How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here 

Taking every breath with you
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all Ican do is watch you leave?
'cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And evenn shared the tears
You're the only one who really new me at all

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now
there's just an empty space
you coming back to me is against the odds
and that's what i've gotta face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a look at me now
I'm just standing here
And you coming back to me
Is against the odds
And that's a chance I've got to face

So take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now<lj-cut text=""against all odds"">"

I was waiting for a cross-town in the
london underground when it struck me
that i've been waiting since birth to find a
love that would look and sound like a movie
so i changed my plans i rented a camera and
a van and then i called you
""i need you to pretend that we are in love
again."" and you agreed to

i want so badly to believe that ""there is truth,
that love is real""
and i want life in every word to the extent
that it's absurd

i greased the lens and framed the shot using
a friend as my stand-in
the script it called for rain but it was clear


that day so we faked it
the marker snapped and i yelled ""quiet on
the set"" and then called ""action!""
and i kissed you in a style clark gable would
have admired (i thought it classic)

i want so badly to believe that ""there is truth,
that love is real""
and i want life in every word to the extent
that it's absurd
i know you're wise beyond your years, but
do you ever get the fear
that your perfect verse is just a lie you tell
yourself to help you get by?"

ALL DAY grrrr, i left him here and went with julie shopping for new fish :-) good times. then we ended up leavign my house cuz fredo was freaking out! and we were both craving mcdonalds so we got a # 1 and went to his house then i called nicholle to say i couldnt go to movies cuz i had no money at all and i was at fredos till late. but TOMMORW WE SHALL GO so hopefully my brother isnt being gay and wants to leave for camping early. oh yeah me and fredo are going camping! i asked julie to but she has to work on saturday :-( oh well. good times.<3

ALL THE BAND WERE SO FUCKING GOOD i liekd then all aphasi was like a reject thursday lol it was funny i liked them though. motograter was awesome NON OF THE GOOD PICS CAME OUT!!! i hate my camera so much they'll end uo showing up liek a month later when i downlaod other pics lol. oh wel. grade8's keyboardist was random as all hell.... i dont even think he played i think he just hit a button to make a soud effect liek the guy in motograter lol. hm he was hot and i got pics with him and the lead singer BUT THEY DIDNT SHOW UP . maybe ill find them later, damn digital technology.

"event","A/N: I apologize for the lack of updating in this ""journal"", but it is due to my current position. This journal was not meant to be a role-playing journal. It was purposely meant to be an outlet for my muse. But due to circumstances beyond my control, it was totally taken the wrong way and it's believed purpose/idea has spread throughout the Lj community to an un-healthy level. This I regret sadly, but since I cannot change it, this journal will remain under the illusion that it is a ""role-playing"" journal and will be updated whenever I have the spirt, if and when it ever comes to me, that is. Thank you.

P.s. I had to say that, you know I did. And ""you"" know who you are. ""Alas for the folly of these days!"" -Denethor"

Am I the only one who finds it odd that anyone would want me as their <a href=""http://www.lordoftherings.net/media/desktops/pippin_800.jpg"">wallpaper</a>? Because that is just plain strange to me. @~@ (No offense dear ::snerks::)

I agree; <a href=""http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/bakshi/bakshi.htm"">funniest page EVER.</a> That movie amusedly sucked man. And I sounded like a backup for Alvin and the Chipmunks. Sad sad sad...

Oh, BTW- We're going to Florida at the end of the month. I don't think we'll like it as much as we did for Cali, but still, should be fun, long as the weather is great. Ah, Cali. Such a... er, ""interesting"" place, as you drove down the streets, packed with Jack in the Boxes, Taco Bells, and occasional ""adult"" stores (what was with that?), oh, and a Gay Mart. Oh we had a laugh then. And that beach was so windy, my God. You couldn't even walk! Ah, that was fun indeed. :)"

"event","Ah, hello there! Sorry I haven't updated in a bit. Happy New Year to you all. I hope it was fun :)

I've seen the movie 4 times now. Hehehe, fun fun. It's still weird seeing myself up there. I hope we win one of those Oscar thingys. That would be fun.

For lunch today... Fajhitas! Did I spell that right? I don't know... Yes! They were very messy and very good, almost as good as tacos. They come in 2nd to them :D

Right now, I'm kind of tired. I hate being tired. Why? Because it's no fun. And there's nothing good on the tv to watch. And it's cold outside. Bugger. TNT keeps showing The Mummy over and OVER, I swear about 50 times, but it's on only at night. Gah. The 2nd one was a joke, we were laughing more than being scared. Heh heh.

Well, that's all for now. Er, ""stay tuned"". Or something..."

"event","Shopping makes you very tired... Oy. :P And especially when it's at the mall. I think it has something to do with walking on tiles... Nevermind, I don't know.

The people got all hot and bothered with me, which was both annoyning and amusing, I can't decide which emotion prevailed over the other. My good friend tried explaining it to the saleswoman, but then she got cross with her as well. I wanted to say to the saleswoman ""Bitch, leave my girl alone."" ""GASP! A hobbit swearing?!"" Heh. Honestly, someone should post a billboard or something about it. A nice big white one with huge, red print, all in capitols: ""HOBBITS DO NOT WEAR SHOES."" It's not that hard of a concept to grasp, my God...

Now we've got the house to ourselves, as her parents went out. I think I'm off to take a nap, my eyelids feel heavy. Or should I stay awake? Hmmm... oh well. That's all for now :)"

Er, anyways- Hullo! Pippin here, and this is my journal, obviously. I really don't know why I bothered to get one, but y'know, here I am, so, um... yeah.

Today, I woke up very very late, 12 o'clock to be precise. And I don't really get it because I slept pretty well last night! I mean, well, ok, so I went to bed at 10:30 (wasn't my fault! :D), but still, I konked out pretty quick! But more sleep is always fine with me, I'm not complaining. ::big grin:: Breakfast is being ""configured"" (heh) at the moment. I hope it's big- d'you know what's she's trying to do? No second-breakfasts! She's trying to get me off on some hobbit-wonder diet! Kirryn, knock some bloody sense into the woman! I mean really, no second breakfast? Oh dear, I just said that outloud. Now she's teasing me. I've got her all riled up, ahaha. Mmm, breakfast time! Sorry, this is very important, must go, talk to you all later!"

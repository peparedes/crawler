"event","Gosh. 

So today did not start out the best. I'm dumpy. hmmh.

Last night would have been fantastic. I had a great time seeing friends who I hardly see at all anymore because of my effing 19hrs and all that they entail. I danced like mad. It was great music as usual. I miss the Thursday nighters at the Cellar. I'm so glad I was able to go out. 

Just as the night was winding and the lights came up, there was drama. Good gosh, drama. Justin said to my comment of ""I hate this shit. Drama!"": ""It's amazing that it always seems to find you as much as you hate it."" Seriously, I say. 

Paul, the FUCKING ASS, ended up there. No surprise. Actually expected it. When he tried to dart me a what's up nod, I turned away. I'm still rightfully angry with him for his comment to my big brother, on his wedding night of all nights, that was not in anyway necessary or acceptable. AND for his ridiculous behavior towards my lovely cousin. She deserves so much fucking better. 

Lauren, as mixed up as she is, has such a rough time with it. I tried to keep her away from him, but in the end she ended up talking to him anyway. She was pretty stubborn last night which didn't make it any easier on Shekina and me. 

When Laur was chatting with him I tried pulling her away but she snapped at me which pissed me off more because he's no good for her and she knows it. So I decided fine, and I walked away from it like I always want to. Shekina stayed and chatted some advice into his ear about how he should be treating Lauren. All I want is for him not to be treating her at all, but not in her life. Luckily Lauren went to dance with a friend of her's that she saw across the floor so she wasn't near him any longer at this point. 

I guess maybe Shekina's talking to him sparked some kind of humility in Paul because he came up to me, which I didn't like. I told him I didn't want to talk, to which he told me he ""probably shouldn't even say anything right now,"" to which I asked him, ""Then why are you?"" 
 
I kept trying to push him away and turn away. Poor Shae and Bunny were standing behind me not having an effin clue. But Paul insisted on trying to tell me that he didn't know the situation the night of the wedding and that he didn't mean to say anything. I'm baffled at how many things he says and ""doesn't really mean."" I told him (all the while being interrupted with more 'I didn't mean it""s) ""I really don't care. It's not okay. You don't mess with my brother. You upset him on his wedding night and that's not cool at all. You need to just leave cause I don't want to talk to you."" So he loudly called me a dike and told me to go fuck myself as he back away. 
 
I was angered at the whole thought again of everything he's done and how much of an effing idiot he is, but trying to cool off. So then, here comes more baffling, a minute later he comes BACK up to me and tells me, ""I didn't mean to say that. I meant something else that I didn't say,"" a comment which in itself is baffling. But what the hell? You know? Geeeez. I just shook my head and he spouted off another ""fuck you"" and I hugged my boys and left. 
 
I knew Lauren was in her car sitting her drunk out, but I didn't know where Shekina went so I called Lauren to check on her and then Shekina to tell her about what I'd had to deal with. She came outside and told me that he talked to her after he talked to me and apparently ""Fuck [our] whole family. [We're] all bitches."" 
 
I'm so done with him. I'm glad I handled myself the way I did. Walking away is always better. I hate drama. Uhh. 
 
Lauren and I talked today. She apologized for everything again, but I'm tired of her apologies....the ones for Paul. She knows he's bad for her, she knows she needs to get away from and over him, and I believe she wants to. She's just really mixed up and it's hard, when you care about someone so much to focus on their faults and really think about the bad stuff all the time when you really only remember the good. I've been there and it sucks, but I had to figure out on my own that I was better off. No one else could make me feel that no matter how much I was told. I know Lauren needs to do that too. Only she can. So I'm just going to do what I can, when I can, to keep her away from him and support her. I love her to death and hate to see her go through all of this shit and be treated so badly. I know she'll figure things out and that she's even better off than she was before this and she's getting closer everyday, but it does take time. It took me months to even realize how terrible things were in my situation and how much better off I was without that guy. It changed me for the better and I know it will her too. I know more about myself and after going through all of it, it even helped realize some things later about Eric and me along our journey and I think that's proved to be one of the driving forces that has enabled us to stay friends. It's funny how past relationships can better future or present ones.
 
I'm sometimes amazed at how much I've been through and how learned I feel at times when I'm giving advice to others who are experiencing what I have in the past. I'm grateful for every mistake I've made."

"event","I think if Trick and Liz didn't get married, it wouldn't really feel so new. But they did. :)

The wedding was amazing. The whole process, though stressful even for me at times, was fun, and I've always been the kind of girl to feel like I can't wait till that's me. Even if I'm single right now and will be for awhile, I've always been waiting for my wedding. :) 

The rehearsal dinner was good fun. I'm glad that their friends are all really cool and funny and that Lizzie's family is awesome. The food at the Hilton was A-MAZ-ING. Seriously. I gave my toast. I shook for about 5min after, but everybody told my it was really good. 

Thursday was spent shopping for bras to wear with the dress, picking up programs, tying ribbon on to each one(while watching: Truman Show and Titanic), re-hemming my dress, Gold Star for dinner, showering, and coloring the amazing sign with Michael D. (Trick's friend) for the Ushers to bust through at the reception entrance. I was up too late, but I looked okay the next day thanks to Preparation H (unused on the ass) on the eyes and make-up. :)

Friday was fun all day. Even though we were up early, the hair and make-up process was a good time. The ceremony was so great and I had such a good time being in the wedding party. First bridesmaid experience (hey and limo ride) thank you. I didn't cry nearly as much as I anticipated which is good. I only used one tissue. hah. It still feels different having Patrick married though. It's kind of surreal. 

The limo was the best. It was huge - we called it the ""semi."" haha. After the ceremony we all had our champagne and little Col Ball had his coke. He was so cute in his little tux. He did a great job as ring bearer. We bumped some music though and laughed a lot. 

The PAR-TAY was great too. Food - amazing, drinks - great, music - so awesome. I shook it all night long. heh heh. :) Some of us gathered at the Pub after and that was fun. I was tired after that though so I didn't go to any after-after parties. 

It was THE best wedding I have EVER been to. Patrick and Elizabeth are so effing perfect for each other. I'm so, so jealous of the kind of love they have. I used to think about how I would have a hard time finding the kind of love my parents have, and maybe it's just cause I'm closer to it, but I think it'll be harder to get what Trick and Liz have. They're going to be so happy together. I'm so glad Lizzie is our sister-in-law because she's amazing. She's kind, intelligent, and beautiful and she just fits into our family so perfectly. 

For New Year's Eve I went to Ron's with the Hunt girls :), Shekina, and Clarey. It was a really good time. I had a lot of fun.

New Year's Day, the family did our annual movie and dinner. Then we stopped by the Grandparent's Hartman to visit with relatives in town. 

E and I got coffee at Perkin's after that. It was so good to see him. We rented a couple movies and hung out all night. I've missed his company so much with our busy schedules. 

I guess the new year is here though. I'm tired of school and I don't want to go back. oh I'm so sick of the 19hrs. I'm stressed because of it and poor because of it. I'm so over education at this moment. I know I need it and want it, but I'm really NOT into it right now. Not at all. I want my life. I don't feel like I have it yet. I'm just breathing right now though, so God, get me through this. Go back tomorrow, yuck. I hope this month goes by fast. I already need that break at the end of the month.

I should get ready for bed soon so I'm out."

"event","Things are beginning to get slightly crazy. It feels like time is flying. I feel like there's so much for me to do, but I can't think of anything. I just keep telling Patrick, ""Let me know what I can do, or what needs to be done."" 

Clare and I bought a Christmas tree from Sears today with white lights, pre-lit, for the reception. it's a very cute idea to have them. Christmas as a presence with make the whole thing that much better. 

The seating arrangements are being taken care of tonight. I have a feeling that's going to have a late ending. Pray for my brother he has a sore throat three days before his big day. 

Tomorrow is the rehearsal dinner. I'm sucking it up and giving a toast. I feel like it's a really nice thing to do. I don't want to look back and think I wish I had said something. He's my big brother. 

Christmas was good. The Eve was cool. I went to church with the family this year because I didn't go to Eric's side obviously. It felt good. The time at home on Christmas Day was good, but I think it felt rushed at the relatives. It was nice, but I couldn't help feeling like something was lacking. I didn't feel as ""togethered"" this year. I thought about Eric's activities. We even talked for awhile when I was at the Stricker side festivities. I was glad to be able to. 

I haven't seen him in a week now and that's so strange. I don't really like it much at all. I guess that's one thing making me sad right now. That and the bittersweet of Patrick getting married. Things about Eric though aren't nearly as bad as they were.  

It's still not the best feelings I've had of course and I know I'm going to be single for a long while, but I'm doing better with the whole thing - there haven't been tears. I think that Christmas and the wedding have helped to distract me a lot and that's been good for me. But I do still miss him a lot at times. I guess I know it's better this way though. I just can't help sometimes to think about how hard we tried though. Cause we did. And sometimes that makes me thankful that we love each other that much and others it makes me bitter that it still didn't work out. ""I am drawing the story of how hard we tried...""

Every morning here I wake up and I'm reminded of how much I don't want to go back to school. I'm not a school person and what my regret for having to go causes me to feel and think only makes me think I'm better off not getting a BA but just being happy with my AA. I think sometimes that thinking this is stupid, but there are times when I still feel like what the hell am I doing? 

Friday is going to be tremendous and emotional and wonderful. Note to self: bring extra tissues. I can't believe it's so close now. It's so weird - Patrick's getting married. Geeeez."

"event","*forgive me for being morose*


There are shadows falling on my violet walls. Shadows that cast this darkness that I not only see behind these objects, but that I feel inside. Scattered around me is the disaster that was born from my depression. Baskets of unfolded, and now wrinkled clothes sit on a floor much in need of vacuuming. My dresser and desk are unkempt, just the way I hate it. Cluttered in front of me are things that refresh just as much clutter in my mind of things I haven't done or need to remember. Empty frames I want to fill, favors or projects that remain untouched, and stacks of used cups from my nightly water. It all makes my emotion that much worse. 

I am not myself.

I have new pillows in my favorite cases and there seems nothing new about them except that they're one more thing that I have to get used to. We have our Christmas tree up and partially decorated and I was only excited and happy for about an hour. So very unlike me. 

Sometimes I feel like I've never felt more alone. I know that I have, but it's one of those moments when you're down and you just feel as if you can't ever get up or you'll never be yourself again. I'm looking for who I am right now and she's not here. I have moments where I feel like she's returned, but those moments are fleeting. My behavior is erratic and I hate it.

Some thing's gone and it's becoming physically taxing for me to hide it when I need to. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm going through something I don't want to be, that I don't understand and that literally makes me angry. I'm not coping with these changes. Sooner or later the shell is going to crack and I'm so afraid that I'll no longer be who I was...who I want to be...who I was finally happy with 

Life, especially Christmas, just IS NOT the same without me. It needs a band-aid, but I've run out of them. So frightened of bleeding to death."

i'm registered for all my classes and them some. i still have to hear back from my advisor to be sure which ones i need to keep because i have more than enough to fill my distributives but need to be told by my advisor which courses can go towards my electives. why they can just print those out accordingly for majors on the evaluations like every other category is beyond me. 

and i'm about to look into georgetown, st. mary of the woods, and louisville for my bachelor's. i told e yesterday that it feels like high school looking at colleges, except this time i want to do it. waiting was good for me.

the terrible is fading. i can feel it. i'm still not about going out much - it comes and goes, but i'm not so depressed feeling. i don't know what's changed, but i'm not going to complain about not feeling like complaining. :) i just hope it lasts. i'm not really pessimistic about it but not optimistic either so we'll see. 

e and i had our first official date, but no, we're not back together. things are really good there and we're on our road to recovery. we went to dinner at york st. cafe since i haven't been there in ages and he never had. it's our new ""nice place to eat"" restaurant. the date was the most fun i've had on a first date since he and i had our first first date. hmmh. i'm extremely happy with the way things are and how they're going for us. 

i got to see angel today and that was good, though, as always because of life, it was too short a time we had to spend together. i've missed her. i hate not being able to see her any time i want. but she may be coming home next weekend too and i'm probably going down there the weekend of my bday for a halloween party which will be fun. i didn't get to dress up last year so i'm happy that i'll be able to probably twice this year. she and i got to catch up a little on things in our lives. we talked about how identical we are when it comes to our reactions and feelings. i'm so grateful to have a friend who's like a sister, literally. 

FYI to the friends if you want to come out for my birthday let me know. it's FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28. it's gonna be at BARLEYCORN'S in COLD SPRING but i'll let you know what time when i find out who wants to go etc."

my mood is still fluctuating, up and down. it has nothing to do with time of day or activity. i still have no idea where it comes from. 

i love the weather. i am ""home"" because of it. people can sometimes have a type of depression that responds to the lack of sunlight that the change of season brings with fall and winter. i was always brought more happiness because of those changes of season. i guess i found more solitude in the kinds of things that fall and winter bring more than anything when i was ever sad during those seasons. i've always been a winter woman. and i love fall, but my heart can't wait for frost and snowflakes. you should hear it beat at the thought of them."

""fuck,"" ""fucking,"" ""shitty,"" and ""shit"" are all still used quite frequently, but i don't cuss like it's my job as much recently. it's more like a volunteer position that happens not as often. hah. ""effing"" is also used entirely too much and i'm sure that the friends around may get annoyed with me at times, but EFF that. hah hah.

the whole brian thing is done. it's good though. he and i are two different people - easy to see now. religion and politics, ah geez. but i actually saw him the other night cause i hung out with wes, (that day was effing great btw). i hadn't talked to him really since he said he needed time which i think i've come to see as an easy out = boys are fucking dumb most of the time.  even when they're great guys, which brian is, they do stupid, thoughtless shit. but seeing him was good because i know there's nothing there. and i knew it before that, that he and i were done, but people said he'd call up an say i miss you or whatever. i knew that call wouldn't come, but the absence and distance of it all made me miss him because of the things i liked about him. as far as friends go though, i don't think he even wants to muster that, but i don't know what he's thinking really, he just appeared to want to be removed from me when i saw him last. it's good though. despite how much i really liked him, when i found something that i won't compromise myself on and i know he probably wouldn't either, it changed what we had because there's no future for two people who believe different things. i'm satisfied with it. 

other things are good. 

eric and i are getting closer, if that's possible and it's pretty friggin cool. he's always been a best friend of mine, but i'm learning more and more so i'm happy with that.

wes, e, neil, john, and me are getting our shit together. have our first practice/meeting on saturday. i'm stoked about that.

on the downside, despite these good things and some fun i've had, i'm in a rut. but most of the time the things i'm happy about do not supersede the feeling of shittiness i'm overcome with recently. i can hide it at class, or work, but it's getting harder to. i keep telling e that i just want a break, to get away. but i can't and that makes things worse, to think about my responsibilities and commitments. fuck. 

i've been spiraling further down as the days have been passing. i thought that i had no motivation for school, but i'm coming to find out that it's for life. and that's shitty, super shitty. i can't figure out what's wrong with me. i'm depressed with nothing to be depressed about. e, was trying to help me examine my life to find the culprit, but not finding anything just made me more frustrated and upset. i've no idea what to do. i'm back to feeling how i haven't felt in years. the way high school felt when i was so low. it effing sucks. so along with that feeling, though, comes the guilt i feel for being depressed for no reason when so many people are worse off than me and that doesn't make me feel any better. i'm at a loss about what to do here."

i fucking have no motivation for school. maybe i shouldn't have gone to beer cellar last night, but i needed the stress release badly and i ended up having so much fun. it fucking rocked cause i saw so many people. people i saw and only talked to, laughed with and/or danced with for a bit: matt s. / jake / dave and steve k / matt j / bauman / joel / brett. and then i spent a good chunk of time with the following separate groups: mark, abs, bunny, mercedes, mike, friends of theirs i don't know well / erin, gina, kim, seth, hank (from high school) / wes, joe, jeff, jeff's gf / laur, shauna. i had a great time. but i didn't go to classes today. it's shitty and i will not let myself do that again. fuck.

wes, eric, my myspace friend john, and i are gonna start a band. cover band. w00t. but as soon as wes gets his kit back to his house from jake's we're gonna have a practice without the bass player that we need. which will still be good and helpful. this should be fun.

working tonight. hoping that midpoint music fest will leave me with a good chunk of cash from tips, without making me feel like i'm fucking up. good luck, al.

nothing else is new. 

p.s. ang hope you feel better. sinuses suck most of the time for me too. boo!"

i'm going to bed sometime soon hopefully. the net will not seduce me tonight. i dare say.

i'm itching to start writing again. e gave me an idea for writing and i think it starts tonight. most especially because i'm feeling extremely relaxed at the moment. lovely beer will do that. i really wanted some tonight so i've had some. i had a what i'd call a clumsy day. the drink and music have both helped. mmm...

i'm off so i'm not up too late. -my clock is wrong-

night.

"event","my body seems to be failing me. i think my immune system is just way down. i'm going to the doctor because it's gotten to hate me so. i would like to not have an ear ache and swollen glands and a ditch in my gum and fucking sinuses that pop my eye out. 

i'm not in a very happy mood as we all can tell. circumstances, shmircumstances.

eric just left and i wished for all the world that we'd had all the time in the world because he cheered me up so very much today. i'm glad he's back in town because i missed him. i'm so glad for his friendship. he knew exactly what to say to me about brian, even when it was stuff i didn't want to hear. thank you, e. i love you.

i think that i'm doing better with not hating on myself for the way things are with brian because i know it's not my fault and that's a good thing. but i'm in that whole slump of missing him. SHITTY. cause i'm being all scared that we're probably never going to have what we wanted before all this. and it's strange to me to ask wes how he's doing. i don't like that i need to do that. i want to ask brian how brian's doing. damn. i feel like such the girl about everything. some would say, ""that's probably because you are, al."" yes, yes. oh i know, but i'm feeling like i fell too fast. and that's shitty to me somehow. is it though for real? geez. 

i watched a total of two and a half movies today. ""love me if you dare"": was amazing. just great. (beware if you decide to check it out, it's a french film, so be sure you like subtitles before you rent it :)) and then eric and i rented ""the united states of leland"" which, honestly i haven't seen such a great movie like that is an extremely long time. it now comes very highly recommended by me. siskel and hartman give it two thumbs up. hmmh. and then we started ""hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" but i have a test in bio so we had to stop it.

anyway e and i had dinner at the good old olive garden and that was fantastic. i love it cause they've got my wine there. i swear it's flippin orgasmic for me. lambrusco. :) so buy me a bottle - i swear it's cheap. yum. hah hah.

i'm actually slightly hungry now but i must away to bed. i have class effing early and then it's straight to work. i already know before the dawn, that tomorrow is going to suck. at least maybe the rain will keep customers inside. but fuck i bet it will keep them away and i'll be poor. wait oh that's right, i already am. eff it. 

i'm out."

"event","<P>brian needs time. we finally talked and it was on aim no less which sucks but i guess is better at that same time. he's pretty conservative and it bothers him that i even have a relationship like that in my past, regardless of whether or not i'm a different person now. i don't know what needing time means, but like angel said, at least it's that. </P>
<P>i'm mad at myself for being mad at myself. hmmh. i'm mad at myself to begin with because of how it came up and the fact that it did. i'm here doing the whole ""kicking myself in the ass about this"" thing. lauren keeps telling me at least it's now though so it won't be even harder later and i know that's right, but then i'm an effing idiot sometimes and i think <EM>fuck...maybe if it were later he'd care to much about me to let it be this big of an issue.</EM> i don't know if that's true. it's just hard cause i really friggin like him and i feel like i screwed myself. i'm fearing him coming to me when he's ready and saying, ""i can't do this.""</P>
<P>it sucks cause i just want to see him and talk to him and kiss him and laugh because he's tickling me or saying something hilarious or making fun of me. i want to smile at his expressions. i want to hear him tell me i'm gorgeous/so fucking hot/beautiful and i want to stare into his eyes with his nose pressed against mine.&nbsp;i'm rationalizing the fact that i feel like this even though it was so early for us by the fact that we had these things despite it being so early for us. </P>
<P>eric's calling me when he gets back in town and we're gonna hang out. that will help. he called me when dave was playing it i was glad because i could actually hear it pretty well. it's funny cause he also left me a message of dave before that that wasn't as clear and dave was talking and i couldn't understand what he was saying, but i knew it was him. :) hah i know him well ha ha. </P>
<P>also looking forward to a call from angel. i was thinking last night about how lucky we are to be so far apart and still be best friends. she's still an incredible pillar in my life and i don't know what i'd do without her. i love you, angel! i know you'll help me be okay again with parts of me that i don't like right now. </P>
<P>so far the day has been uneventful.</P>"

"event","the wedding ended up being friggin great fun. jenna benna and i tore it up old school style on the dance floor. spinning around each other and spinning each other around. :) it was lots of fun. brian ended up not being able to go, but i had a great time anyway. none of the girls had dates so it turned out to be nice like that. 

shauna, laur, shekina, and i went to main strauss after. and that effing rocked too. we all had our heels on and our pretty dresses, but despite the painful ankles and toes, it was one of the most fun nights i've had in a long time. i ran into wes down there and we danced it up. he's an awesome guy.

eric called me while i was at the reception and left a message telling me he got to chicago okay. that was thoughtful of him. he called again today to tell me how farm aid is. it sounds extremely fun. he called again when john mayer came on but it was hard to hear him play and he was just riffing anyway. but he's calling me again when willie goes on and others. that will be cool to hear. 

slept in till noon today because i didn't crawl in bed until 3:05am last night. i got a shower right when i woke up and then finished up ""layer cake"" which ended greatly. then did homework which wasn't bad because it was short story and i enjoyed ""columbus school for girls"" a lot. 

i'm supposed to go over to brian's tonight and talk about things. he's weirded out by the fact that i once had a relationship with a girl. i don't know. so we have to talk about things. eric said that's how he was too when he found that out because of not being able to compete with a girl since it's something he could never give me. but brian said me having fooled around with a girl he wouldn't really mind, but that i had a relationship with one was weird. bah. i know some people think it's weird, i do sometimes even, but i'm not that person anymore. hopefully he'll pull through for me, but if not then i guess he's not for me because he can't like me for who i am, even if that means it's because of my past - my past is part of me. that might suck though because he's a great guy and i always laugh so hard and have such a good time when i'm with him.

"event","i'm addicted already. shit. i should be going to bed now because i have to be at school at 830 tomorrow and then i work. i'm thinking a nap might be in order. hopefully i don't know. but i love my new computer. she's friggin great. yes, i named her. yes, i'm a dork. yes, i know it. 

eric and i are hanging out tomorrow. we had dinner tonight. it was good and then bad and then okay and then shitty and then hopeless and then better and now things are good. so at least it ended well. i guess i didn't realize that it'd be so hard for him because he was always the one to be stone. things are slightly backwards now. but i'm glad he's giving it a chance. he knows about brian now and that's kind of relieving. i'm not about to relay things to him daily about how things are going or i'm feeling, etc. but it's nice knowing i'm not hiding it from him, even if it would be to spare him.

brian's studying hardcore for this test he has on saturday. i think it must have to suck. i hate studying. i'm saying prayers he'll do well. he deserves to. 

tomorrow night starts my long weekend staying at hagerty's (the neighbors) to house sit and make sure quin, has everything he needs and just isn't alone over there. 

i would love a vacation right now. it's only the end of the second week of classes and i'm so done with them. i just have no motivation. it sucks. i know the 8am classes play a role which is like: why am i up right now, right? i guess i need to go, but i had to feel her keys some more. :) mahaha geez. j/k.

"event","the dell is here. thank god. it tried to come yesterday but no one was home, poor thing. hah. i can't wait to have her up and running. i'm elated. 

school is shitty. i hate it right now - these early classes are kicking my ass. 

work was slow today -fuckin sucks, whahoo i made $20 shitty. damn it. i'm thinking maybe if it doesn't get better i might have to find something else. ugh. 

i'm being paranoid about brian not calling me back, or at all, last night. know why? shitty period. i hate this week of pills. no estrogen = no fun most of the time. i just think so differently and it's difficult sometimes. cause five bucks he calls tonight and he left his phone on silent or some shit. blah. i'm retarded when i'm like this. 

the massage party was a lot of fun. full body massage was great. i needed it. i slept so well last night. i also got a toy from tiff's friend who had the party, shelly. it's amazing and i haven't even used it fully yet. ha ha. periods will do that. 

talked to eric again last night and it was a good conversation. we're hanging out on thursday which will be good for us. friendship is good for us. 

i have a lot of homework for tomorrow which sucks. ohwell. at least some of it's reading for short story and i like that. 

bah i should do some of that stuff now. later.

"event","i'm anxious for my computer. daddy told me it shipped on the 8th so i'm so expecting it now. :) ah i can't friggin wait. 

bengals pulled it out yesterday. w00t. it was a good game.

don and lydia's was good times yesterday. however it wasn't the same without, the other older cousins there too. don picked on me and stole my shoe and threw gravel at me. classic don. :) i saved ava's life - i was the only one who saw her climbing the last stair to the pool so i sprinted across the driveway and then lawn and got to her as just as she leaned toward it. i was scared, but she just kept saying ""pooool, pooool?"" she's friggin adorable though. i love my little cousins. 

i talked to eric last night. he's doing better and i'm glad. i'm grateful we can be friends. there's still stuff there though that i need to get past or let go or understand. i will. we're gonna have lunch or dinner or something this week. that will be good cause when we've talked we didn't really have all the time in the world and i want to have that. 

went over to brian a.'s later last night and hung out there. yeah...i've been doing that a lot. i like it though, i like him and his room mates and buddy the dog. :) it's a good time there. and i run into people i haven't seen in awhile when i go over there. like chad from upstarcrow and candace sutmiller. anyway i told brian about anna last night because we were talking about porn and strip clubs and i just thought it'd be good timing. he thought it was a little weird, but when i've thought about it, yeah it is a little weird. but i'm just glad i know i'm much happier with men - i don't think i've posted that i discovered this recently. 

plan on doing some homework and hangin out today. food would be good right now too. later i'm going to a massage party with tiff so that will rock. i'm tight as hell."

"event","i'm sore today from walking all day yesterday and being busted around on the bumpy beast. it's funny because that was the last roller coaster we road and i was pretty okay until i got slammed into the middle of the seat and now i have bruises. i have this one rather weird one that's just this round prefect circle about the size of an eraser on a pencil. don't know about that one. **it was weird to go without eric.

i'm kind of sinus problemed out today. i was having small issues with them yesterday, but i think that maybe riding tomb raider made it all clog up because of the incessant hanging upsidedown.

we got back late last night so we didn't feel like doing much, but laur and i both wanted to get out for a little bit. i was supposed to go out with brian a. and friends, but we were both tired and he and his brother(twin), kevin, were watching the OU/TX game and getting up early so they were just going to bed after the game. so i went to a friend of laur's for a bit. funny shit because i ran into matt, one of brian's room mates, and he was like ""what are you doing here?"" it was funny.

i stayed for like an hour and then laur and i left wo i came home a crashed right away. in bed by 1205am. i was proud. 

today is the annual bash at don and lydia's. good food. and bengal's first game. gonna watch it while i get put my face on. it's gonna start in a couple minutes though so i should go for now.

went to brian's again tonight. he makes me laugh so hard. and wes, frickin wes, he's flippin hilarious. :) those guys are just all fun. buddy, the dog, who is part great dane/part greyhound is frickin awesome too and beautiful. brian told me he added clare as a friend on facebook. i thought that was cute. she told me also that he did and that she didn't think he remembered her. yep it was awfully long ago. *giggle* about the way she and i used to run after him, kevin, and patrick wanting to play the games they did. ha ha.

and just got home though cause i always stay there too late.

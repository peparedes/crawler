"event","<p>You know, the more I examine my life, the more I realise how much I may have wasted some of it. Now, before you go &quot;oh no, here goes Leo on one of his self-obsessive, depressive rants again - just slash your wrist and get it over with you emo prick&quot;, hear me out.</p><p>Life should NOT be lived with regrets. However, as luck would have it, we&#39;re all human. Therefore we make mistakes, do stupid things and fuck-up occassionally. We miss great opportunities, refuse to act out of fear and hold ourselves back because we are afraid of rejection. I have done, and do, all of the above. However, I have taken occasional risks, put my heart on the line, done things out of the ordinary for me and have seen it gloriously pay-off or wwitnessed&nbsp;the ridiculously shameful failure of it.<br /><br />These things should be celebrated.<br /><br />I am slowly learning to do that. At 36 and a half, I know I still have plenty of life left in me, though recent health scares, coupled with my own distinct brand of laziness, have set off a few alarm bells. However, i&#39;ve found the mute button for those, so they can fuck off. I spend my days waking up, eating crappy food, going to a job that i&#39;m afraid to leave because of the uncertainty of the world outside, not exercising even though I should and basically sitting around, wallowing in my own self pity. A change is coming though. I can feel it, I am starting to feel more inspired, more alive. I am taking a slightly more reckless, cavalier attitude to my existence and its about damn time too.&nbsp; Its kind of liberating to realise what you can do and what risks you are prepared to take; as long as you know the framwork you have to work in, then bloody well go for it. I am trying to do just that. Its not easy - i&#39;ve built some very high, thick walls around myself these past few years since my marriage break-up. I still love Shannon very much, but she has moved on already and we now&nbsp;hardly talk. She will always be family to me and will always remain special, though I am mad and bitter at her occasionally when I see the debt I lumber under thanks to our short time together (though, to be fair, most of it is mine anyway, so I really can&#39;t bitch and moan).<br /><br />I am about a year and a half from being completely debt free and will have my car paid off in another 9 months or so. Once that is done, I really intend to spend a bit more money on me and start saving for a decent overseas holiday, or a house, or a new car, or any other of the material bullshit things we find ourselves being wrapped up in daily. There really is no sense to it; half the things we buy really have no useful long-term use and we could realistically go without them if we used our brains a bit.<br /><br />(At this point, please disregard the&nbsp;grammatical mistakes - I am typing this on my stepmothers laptop here at my parents place in Gingin, with the overhead fan blasting cool air onto my neck but sounding like a jet engine at crusing speed at the same time.)<br /><br />I guess one of things I am dealing with is the conflict I feel about my personal&nbsp;life and how I am coping with not being in a relationship. Right now, part of me is incredibly lonely and yearns for a special lady to spend time with, to be wrapped up in bed with and to generally have as a companion. However, selfish me, thaat insidious bastard, just wants the occasional contact, a good fuck buddy and some titties to play with.&nbsp; Not good. Part of me is thinking that its high time I got my divorce sorted so I can finally move on with my life and leave my first marriage behind - set myself and Shannon free from each other. She has her own demons to deal with, she doesn&#39;t need me sitting in the corner wailing like a banshee-harpy hybrid. It&#39;d be good to have that break, though it will sadden me greatly.<br /><br />Career-wise, I just want to be happy, stimulated and made to feel important. More money would really help too, but its not going to happen at my current employer (which is incredibly sad to say). Part of&nbsp;it&nbsp;is getting my head around my actual career-prospects and seeing what I am really worth. Would a complete career change be a good idea? Would trying something different or going in a new direction be an option? Maybe I should try my hand at comedy like I always meant to? Or get back into playing drums and singing and maybe get that going again. I dunno. At this point I am rambling, so if you&#39;ve stuck with me so far, then good on you. You either must be very interested in me or have the patience of a saint. Even though they don&#39;t exist....</p><p><br />One of things I am struggling against is a complete lack of motivation. I know what I need to do; doing it is proving to be difficult. I have an incredible talent for putting obstacles in my own way, to block my own progress, even if&nbsp;the supposed outcome is going to be positive. Its a bit rich, like overly sweet chocolate ice cream topping and just as thick and gluggy too.... but, i&#39;ll finish this another time.</p><br />"

After this week I hate the word TEST or EXAM or QUIZ!  They have run my life....T-Minus 19 hours until school ends and FALL BREAK begins!!

I sprained my wrist today some how....who does that!??  honestly?  NO ONE...and I wasn'r even doing anything...I think I did it in my sleep, how pathetic!  haha Oh well...its getting better, and I was able to write my 3 essays during my test tonight so as long as I could do that, I don't really mind the pain!  haha I can type fine but that whole writing thing kinda hurts...haha

alright well I was just taking a quick break after my test before I had to sell my soul to political science and etemology...but now I am off...hope everyone had a good day and I hope everyone has an AMAZING weekend!

all my love,

"event","Man it is gorgeous outside!  It is PERFECT weather...I love it!  too bad I have to be inside studying my life away!  No joke....if I make it through this week I can survive the rest of the semester!  and I am talking if this week is a success, not just slugging through.  

I have been in college for what will be 2 & 1/2 years at the end of this semester and never once, other than finals week, have I had a test in EVERY class in one week!!!  That equals SIX EXAMS for Joanna this week!  SIX!  This is ridiculous!  And on top of that I have a quiz to take too!  What is that all about!??  And one of the classes I JUST had a test in 2 weeks ago, and we only have 2 tests other than the final!  This is stupid....but I am bound and determined to get wonderful grades on all of my tests.  I am back into high motivation stage and ""getting my ass in gear"" stage.  I am tired of being apathetic about everything.  

Operation: 'Get your ass into gear' is ready for launch! --> WOW I am a huge dork!  Oh well!

I GOT THE CHEESEBURGER IN PARADISE JOB!  I am so happy!  I don't know if I had written anything about it but I really wanted it!  I found out this summer that they were building a CIP and I have wanted to work there since then!  And I finally figured out where it was and I made it in before they stopped accepting applications and I had a GREAT interview!  I actually had fun during my interview...weird huh??  But that is a good sign that you will have fun at your job!  And its a job where I get to talk, meet new people every day and work with the hottest bartending manager named Derek!  Who, by the way, has a nick name for me already we haven't even had orientation to training yet!  Yeah we hit it off well during the interview process...too bad he is a manager, otherwise I could be getting a boyfriend soon!  yeah right, he probably has a long term girlfriend or fiance or something.  At least I will get to work with him and have fun!  I am excited to meet everyone i am working with.  We are all new, so it level the playing field...but I have somewhat of an advantage though...because i worked at Outback so i kinda know the system pretty well and I am happy because we are using possitouch...which are the computers i used at Outback so i will be familiar with those!  I am glad I am part of the opening staff of the restaurant!  Because then later on down the line I can be like ""yeah I was here when we opened...""blah blah blah...I will be the experienced one who can train the new people and such! Haha...what a dork I am!   Although I wish I could do other things like host and TOGO just because you appreciate those jobs and the people that do them more if you have been in their shoes....and I have, but not at CIP.  Oh well!  I hope I will make a lot of money!  Since the restaurant is new to Muncie and it seems to have a GREAT atmosphere a lot of people will be coming there and hopefully TIPPING WELL!!!  *hint*hint*  My friend Maggie told me she was going to come in on my first day and ask to sit in my section...that makes me happy!  OH I AM JUST SO FREAKIN EXCITED!!  Is it weird to be so pumped about a job?  Well i am really happy to be making money and its not weird to be pumped about that....its just that you know when people say ""I could never work in the restaurant business...."" blah blah blah....I thrive in it!  I love the people and the service and everything!  I love the friendships that you form with your co-workers...you become like a family!  At least that is how it was at Buca and Outback in lexvegas...now the one in Indy, I couldn't be happier not working there...it seemed very separated and like high school with cool people and what not...BOO for that!  And I think in the beginning things will be really good because we will all kinda lean on each other for support since we are all new...but luckily no one is new at serving...it was a requirement to have on the floor experience!      


Alright well I am writing too much and blabbing on and I need to utilize this hour break I have for some studying...hope everyone has an AMAZING WEEK!  

All my love

WiseGY636 (12:30:05 AM): I love you more than LIFE pookie... You are my soulmate and for that I owe you everything. Thanks for being a part of my life. I sometimes have to force myself to make and keep friends because I often think all I need is you
WiseGY636 (12:30:52 AM): You complete me in every way.... I love and adore you....

wouldn't that just make you cry??  well I did!  because I am so greatful!  Now if I could get a straight guy to say that to me...WE ARE SET!  hahaha kidding I would rather it come from him ANY DAY because then I know it is truly meant!

"event","I am so confused...but in a good way i guess.  Ever since I came to Ball State so many people from my past have been popping up back into my life!  It has been great, but weird.  I never expected to talk to half of these people again! Hahahaha a guy 'I went out with' in middle school I talk to all the time now.  And I have a crush on him...again I guess...ITS SO WEIRD!!!!  hahaha  I am just laughing abou this whole thing!  Then another guy that I had the BIGGEST crush on in high school randomly asked me to be his friend on facebook then IMed me out of no where!   Then he was talking to me and he told me he had a crush on me in high school!  I about peed my pants!  haha!  I told him I had had a crush on him and he was like ""no way, why didn't you say something"" and I said I didn't know THEN he tells me ""was thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend to ask you out, but I didn't cause i didn't think you liked me""  I think at that point I DIED!  hahaha

AAAAHHHH This is so funny!  Oh well, it makes me happy that I get to talk to everyone again!  Hope everyone is having a good school year and if you are not in school I hope you are having the time of your life!!!

I like my classes and everything and I want to do really well this semester!  I think I am going to, but I just need my motivation back to kick some hard ass!!!  I also slacked on my whole losing weight thing...even though I still eat the same and I am working out, its just not as much as I used to....boo for that, I need to get my butt back in gear...i lost 8lbs within the first 2 weeks I was here...now I think since then I have only lost 2 more...another boo for that!  But it is Monday, so its time to start a new week and a new work out schedule and school schedule!  

*SIDE NOTE*
People talk so dag gone LOUD in this library!  There is a guy sitting over in a corner talking FULL VOICE on his phone...I can hear his entire conversation....WTF?!?  I definitely don't want to!  This is the library...at KY there were security officers that walked around and would quietly and sternly tell people to get off of the phone...why? you might ask....BECAUSE IT IS A DISRUPTION!!!  

Anyways, on a lighter note...I think my bro is coming up this weekend and I am quite excited about that!  I heart him....we are good friends and I love that we can have a good friendship!!

Alright well I have to go walk over to class....I am doing well on updating...get hype!

I know that sounds sooo lazy, but it was one of those days that you didn't want to talk to anyone, you wanted to be ugly, in your pajamas and not doing anything!  That and I had a huge headache!!  Haha  TODAY was AMAZING!  I just need to say that I LOVE MY FAMILY!!  I went to Richmond for the day for my grandpa's birthday.  It was so great to see everyone, aunts, uncles, and especially cousins!  My cousin Ryan and I are like brother and sister and I got to see him so i was happy about that, and I got to see my cousin Renee, who i haven't seen since like Christmas!!  I have talked to her but I haven't gotten to see her.  And she has a son, who I consider my nephew, because she is like a sister to me anyway.  But her son is ADORABLE and I want to steal him for a weekend.  I told her I would babysit him FREE OF CHARGE for a weekend because that is how much I adore this child!  I LOVE MY FAMILY!  I am just so happy because my day was so wonderful because I was surrounded by laughter, fun, jokes...and people I love!

So my horoscope says that I am supposed to have a relationship this month...that it is actually going to happen....not sure if i agree, but I have a person in mind that I would like it to happen with hahaha.  SO we will see!

I sang a song in choir and it is stuck in my head and I really like the lyrics, even though it is SO repetative....

""As I went down in the river to pray, studyin' about that good ol' way and who shall wear the starry crown good Lord show me the way. Oh sinners lets go down, lets go down, come on down. Oh sinners lets go down, down in the river to pray.""

We had a really good arrangement! I am going to miss choristers next year when I am at BSU...I love that choir! At least I get one more semester!

I am still here...I know its been a long while, I have been really busy, but I am still reading and updating myself with everyone else's life.

A few things:

*Thanksgiving break was: wonderful, hard, weird, interesting, RANDOM, FUN, happy, much needed, productive, all in all I have no quams!
*going back to visit CS was a little different this year, my sister is the choreographer and sometimes when she yelled ooof it was all too familiar haha but I love her and I am proud of her
*I love the fact that I have been out of highschool for two years now and I still hang out with the ""IC""!  haha and we still have PRODUCTIONS!  I love you guys!
*I have made some mistakes in paths I have taken and I am ready to correct them and move on
*Its nice to know that I have friends that I don't have to talk to everyday in order for our friendship to last, we get to just pick up where we left off and everything seems as if we never left each other's side
*I need courage to continue waiting...for something that i don't know if it will ever come, but I, like the hopeful yet stupid girl I am, will continue waiting.
*I miss everyone
*I am a lot closer to my family and that makes me happy!!!!
*I worry for my bro
*My dog snapped at my face today when I was playing with him and his tooth caught the inside of my nose and cut it open...COOL!
*I still have a 2 page paper to write and it is already 1:15...I am MASTER PROCRASTINATOR!  Holla!

On that note I am going to go do the paper...its good to be back!  Hope everyone had a wonderful break!

If you believe in people...OOOOOOOO
Because if we work together...OOOOOOO
If you believe in diversity
Run along with me

Clur and Joanna's solo:
TO DOLLYWOOD!

Just an AMAZING song!  I wish everyone could hear it!  If you support the Asain American Aliance you just may! HAHAHA!  Oh how I miss the ""we are the world"" recording session!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That needed its own area of specialness (is that a word? if not it is now!)

So I woke up today in a great mood!  I am ready to start studying!  I have a plan for the day..which is getting a little delayed because i am talk to people online but who cares!  haha

I talked to Jason (the guy I dated last year) last night and he was being funny and nice again and that is still weird but I enjoy it.  I think I am going to start hanging out with him more.  Haha that could be interesting...when we are together with other people everyone else gets annoyed of us...not annoyed but they don't understand how we interact so it becomes annoying to them because they aren't on the same level...its weird...but we will see how it goes

Philip...oh Philip...everything is good, now that I have actually let myself just go and not analyze everything it is nice.  I can IM him and not care that I am IMing him first!  WHO CARES!?  I can be so stupid sometimes.  We have a fun conversation last night and it was nice.  So with that...everything is just goin with the flow I guess you could say....haha!  I am in a pretty care free mood right now! So this could change tomorrow!

Ya know lately I have been reminded of so many great things like memories and stuff throughout the day and I LOVE THAT!  I think it is so cool that just a smell or a color or a song can take you to a places that range from wonderful to the worst day of your life!  Luckily I have a TON of fond memories and those are the ones I am reminded of, but I think it is great!

But I need to go to the library and have lunch!  Its time to study bitches!  hahaha!  Hope everyone is having a GREAT DAY!

ALL MY LOVE!

I talked to a guy that I dated and spent a majority of my time wastingon last year.  But it was nice to talk to him...it made me remember a little bit of the reason that I liked him at all.  Haha lets just say the whole thing was messed up!  Haha he has a lot of issues...but he made me laugh A LOT last night and he was being nice, which is VERY RARE with him.  It was weird though because when I was talking to him I was just in my own little world...which is how I used to be when we were together and when I realized that I quickly slapped myself out of it...not literally but you know.  Haha

Philip...not much to say...we don't talk a lot anymore...and that makes me sad, but I know that when I look past the little things everything is ok! So no need to worry...(can you tell I am working on my ""no drama, over analyzing""??)

I LOVE THE FALL!  Sweatshirts and jeans weather is my favorite!  And the colors of fall are BEAUTIFUL!  YAY!  And of course it is FOOTBALL SEASON!  Gotta love that business!

Well I must get back to work!  I have a bunch of stuff to do since I missed a week! 

Always,

(Gibby gave me another picture to put up here but when I uploaded it there were white dots all over it and they all just happened to be around my head...it looked kinda funny...so I figured out how to resize and all and I got one on here.  But much love to Gibby for thinking of me!)

Cara is one of my best friends here at school, and she really is one of the coolest people I know!  I love her to death and we are so alike!  We got dubbed ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" last year because we could finish each other's sentences...sad I know!  But what is even worse...I WAS THE BOY!  COME ON NOW!  What is that about?  Hahaha!  

Things I miss about Freshman Year:

"event","Ya know what is SO ANNOYING!?  People trying to chat online!  Who wants to meet a person online that is like 4 hours away from them and make a relationship out of it!  I am sorry if any of you have online relationships....this being different from the only way to keep in contact with the person is through the internet...but you actually hang out with them in person and you did NOT meet them online!  This only happens when I am on aol....but people keep IMing me with ""a/s/l"" GO AWAY!  If you can't go out and meet people, and you have to do it online...THATS SAD!!!  This guy IMed me like he knew so I thought maybe its one of my friends and I just don't know their screen name so I am talking to him and turns out he had read my aol profile that is 1000 years old...and was using information from that to talk to me about...now he is asking me the MOST STUPID questions and I want to say...why are you trying to meet girls online?  Its pathetic!  I am REALLY sorry if I offend anyone with this...its just makes me so mad...I don't know why.  Come on...really...would you try to get a girlfriend or boyfriend online?  That is just so scary!  

Haha now I am totally calling this guy out for what he is doing and he is like ""online chatting is weird""  and I said ""then why did you IM me and try to 'get to know me' ONLINE!?"" he said ""it was my first time I didn't know it would be weird""  RIGHT!  SO I advised him not to do it anymore...because its a sad sad thing!  Haha I didn't say that but...close!

A few points to be made:
*A Chorus Line was GREAT!  Jeremy you were WONDERFUL!  And Craig the cut dancer...AMAZING!  I just loved your reaction when you were cut!  Haha!  No but I really enjoyed the show!
*Cheesecake Factory with your best guy freinds is a GREAT time!
*Camping with your cousins...sounds not fun...but TOTALLY IS! Hahaha
*A lot of family that is unexpectedly much needed and highly enjoyed...A TRUE BLESSING
*To Matty my BFF sorry this weekend hasn't worked out for us to get together...but I will be up in Muncie A LOT because I am DEFINITELY transfering!  YAY!

"event","So this past week has been full of so many different emotions.  Last friday(not yesterday but then one before that) my Grandma passed away.  It was her time and before she passed she was in a lot of pain.  She knew it was coming and she got to see all 4 of her kids 7 of her grandchildren (one was missing because he was in NC) and her 3 great grandchildren.  My grandpa says she waited until she could see everyone before she let herself go.  I was there from 2 until she passed which was about 9-9:30 and I got to spend a lot of time with her.  I was there in the room when she passed and it was nice because she went in her sleep.  She fell asleep then decided it was her time.  It was peaceful for her and that made me happy.  
My Grandpa, we all call him Pop, he was upset but he also knew that it was going to happen. But he is the part that makes me so sad.  He is an amazingly strong man and his job was to take care of her...he did everything from putting her to bed to painting her nails!  He loves her more than anything and he doesn't have her anymore and I think his heart is just broken in two. I mean that was his life partner...they have known each other since high school!  He saw my grandma in her front yard playing ball with her brothers and he said ""I need to meet that girl!"" and he would take his walks by her house and then one day she invited him to play and they were friends all through high school then they married after that.  And they were married over 50 years!! Isn't that AMAZING!  I think it is so awesome that they really were life partners.  yeah they had their hard times but they truly deeply loved each other the entire time!  And that to me is so amazing.  
She was a great woman and she will be missed so much, but she is with her family now and she is the best health ever so she is in a great place.

This week has been such a week for family, under the circumstances we were not brought together for a good reason, but we celebrated her life.  We allowed ourselves to have fun and laugh and be happy when we were together and my Grandma would have wanted that.  This week has brought that side of the family closer together than we already are.  There was a lot of love in every aspect of the week and I think it will be like that for a very long time.  
All in all it was a sad week but a happy one too.  Good things came from something so terrible, but that something so terrible was a release for my Grandma.  We all know she is in a better place and that she wil be looking down on us everyday!  

I love you Grandma.

"event","Thank you for the comments...it helps to look at an outside perspective...

Jeremy...I love you so much, you make me smile a lot and I miss you! 

I have another question...the past like year or so it seems like he was so interested in me in ""that way""...is that just the ""idea""?...because the feeling has only been mutual since April...and over the summer he called me all the time talking about how we needed to see each other.  And I talked to him last night and he acknowledged the fact that we hadn't talked in so long and he was like ""I have been so busy and I am so sorry that we haven't talked.  I miss you"" blah blah blah.  and I had a random missed call this weekend and I had no idea who it was and I couldn't hear the message, but apparently it was him because he asked if I got his message...so now there is some sort of effort being made...oh damn I don't know...I understand the whole ""idea"" thing...and I know the adult feelings are there on both parts because we talked about that when I went to see him, and even then he said it first and I  was hesitant to say it because I wasn't sure if I wanted that whole business to become a reality...but I did say it and I don't regret it or anything, and then when I asked him if his feelings had changed he was like ""NO""  OH and there was this time that we were talking online and we had never talked about what ""we"" were before this point...but I was talking to him and another person and this other girl asked if I had a boyfriend and instead of explaining the entire story I just said I was dating this guy who I met at church camp 7 years ago and we are really good friends and decided to date...oh but my dumb ass accidentally sent that to Philip instead of this girl and I FREAKED OUT!!!!  cause we hadn't talked about labels and stuff and I lied to him and told him that this girl always gets on me when I like a guy and I don't do anything about it so I told her we were dating....and then later on I asked him if what I said made him uncomfortable and he was like ""haha no not at all""  and i said ""okay good because a lot of guys freak out with labels and get really weird"" and he said ""you have nothing to worry about, I will be here for a long time.""  Ok what does that mean?  haha this was before I went down to visit him...hah I don't know...

These past two weeks I think I was just freaking out because my stupid girl mind (no offense ladies) over analyzes everything, but I didn't know if I was over analyzing this whole situation so I posted it.  But no matter what I am still kinda pissed about the birthday thing...I put a lot of time and effort into it, but he thanked me a lot last night for it...DAMN STRAIGHT!  Right now I am just going to try and be very relaxed about this whole thing, because I will be moving to Muncie in a year and that is when I will be able to see what truly is supposed to come of this.  I really can't be doing this shit to myslef for the entire year...i have other things I need to focus on, like my sorority, losing 30 lbs, and getting kick ass grades...and having a wonderful social life all at once.   And I don't need to be worrying about the smallest things ever that are going on with a guy that lives 4 hours away.  I realize this is a total 360 from my last entry, but I get so frustrated with myself when I allow someone that kind of effect on me...ya know the ""I think about him all the time and wonder if he is thinking about me...and when he isn't I get sad""  BOO for that!  I haven't been tied down like this mentally for 5 years and it has been GREAT!  I need to get back to the carefree hottie I used to be!  HAHA! (I am a loser for that one) But until I get the opportunity to make something bigger out of this...its JOANNA TIME with a little bit of Philip on the side!  HAHAHA!  Now if I just read this little self motivating pep talk EVERY DAY i think I can do it!

On a different note:  I am going to try to be at the show on FRIDAY!!  I am leaving here right after classes so I can make it back!  I should be there with no problem!  But I can't wait to see everyone!  I have missed you all so much and I have heard so much from my sister about all the people in the cast and it makes me sad that I am not there...not gonna lie, i am VERY jealous that she got to spend that time with everyone!  HAHA!  But I will be home friday so I hope to see everyone at the show and I know it is gonna kick ass in that everyone stand in a line and kick the same height kinda way!  Haha!

"event","OK BOYS...this one is for you...I have some questions!

Why does it never seem good when something starts like that?  Haha Anyway...here it is: (put yourself in this situation then please tell me what you would do) And girls if you have any input I would love it to!

You meet a girl when you are 12, at a summer camp, you guys are from cities that are about 45 minutes away.  You become friends...the next year at your summer camp (that lasts a week btw) you and this girl, from the year before, become very close.  This is church camp, so many strong bonds are created because deep information is shared.  SO you two become really good friends and you write letters back and forth and call each other whenever you can.  For the next four years you write letters still, then email comes into play and you guys email and each other and occassionally call.  You guys lose casual touch but you still drop emails every once in awhile...during senior year she comes to visit you, she never has done that, you have a girlfriend at the time, but when she comes, you totally forget about your girlfriend...after she visits you guys keep in closer contact, then there is college...
she goes to school out of state you go to school an hour and a half away from home, she is 4 hours from you now.  But into the school year you guys start to talk on the internet...you guys have daily contact with each other.  You and your girlfriend of about a year break-up, and this girl that you have been friends with for about 7 years now is starting to look like something different to you...maybe more than a friend...you go to her formal with her, in november, you guys are close all night even though the dance sucked, then you spend the night with her, nothing happens...and the next day befoer you go, she kisses you.  This sparks soemthing in you and you decide you like her, but you don't tell her.  Then you guys start to talk everyday, and she goes through a really rough time in the beginning of her second semester, but your support means the world to her and you know it.  Towards the end of the year not a day goes by that you two wouldn't talk.  
Its finally decided at the end of the year that you two both have feelings that are more than friends, towards each other...you guys decide that you think you want to do something about that over the summer...because when you both go home you are only 45 minutes away from each otehr...so you guys move home, you call her every weekend but you are both so busy the entire summer that you weren't ever able to see her until two days before she moved back to school.  You have a GREAT night with her when she comes to see you, and you miss her a TON when she goes to school.  You move to school the next weekend but she is so busy she hasn't been ablt to talk to you unless you call her late at night, so you talk to her a few times.  Then after two weeks she is finally settled into her place and gets her internet back up, and you guys start talking non-stop again.  Just like it used to be.
She comes to visit you Labor Day weekend and she spends two nights with you...you act a little stand offish for the time she is there (she has no idea why you are doing this...but you are) stand-offish as in: not very physically flirty like you have been before, when you guys talk online you tell how you miss her and sweet talk her constantly, but when you guys are face to face none of that goes on...but all in all you guys had a good weekend.  But neither she or you knows what you are, so you guys talk about it and decide that you both have the feelings to be exclusive with each other but since you are four hours away, you see no point in it.  So you decide no labels, well since she left, you haven't talked to her barely at all.  You guys don't talk every day like you used to, and she sent you the BEST birthday present EVER, and called you on your birthday but you missed it, and all you did was thank her on AIM to her away message and you never called her back...and then you didn't talk to her until she finally gave in on her ""hard to get"" game and sent you an IM before you went home for the weekend to wish you a good birthday weekend with your family.  You still haven't had an actual conversation with her for about 2 weeks...when you used to talk to her everyday...WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ABOUT!??

You made it seem like you absolutely ADORE her and when she returns your feelings you get weird...what??  Usually people are happy...and she asked you if you had a change in heart for her, but NO you said you will always love her.  OH and that is another thing, you guys have always said ""i love you"" to each other on a friend level and you still say it, but you both feel that feeling for real...but you say ""love you"" still on the friend level...you both think...

This is such a weird situation...but would anyone be able to help me out by maybe explaining what his perspective is?  Because obviously I am not understanding!

Sorry that was so long...its been held up inside for awhile now

"event","Wow...so its been awhile!  How is everyone here at LJ!?  I have missed you all but I have been reading what you guys are writing...and it is good to know how everyone is doing.

I am doing well!  School is great as always!  I moved down early for two weeks of sorority rush and contrary to my expectations, I had  a BLAST!  We got a great group of girls for our new pledge class and my ""little sis"" in my sorority is AWESOME!  Her name is Shannon and she is from eastern kentucky!  

Things with the boy are good...as good can be I guess...I went to see him over labor day weekend and it was fun, but since then it has been different.  I don't know, we don't want to be anything official because we are four hours away and so we decided not even to put a label on us, so that kinda sucks knowing that he can go and date any girl up at school and I have no control or say in it, what so ever....that also scares me.  Because I REALLY REALLY like this one.  Like A LOT!  But we talk still and I sent him the best birthday present ever last wednesday!  He said all his friends were jealous and it was a huge hit at his party.  It was a ""how to have a good drunken time"" kit.  It had all these drinking games and their directions in it, then I provided all the stuff needed to play them, besides the beer of course.  Then I gave him a list of delivery places and their numbers for when they got their drunken hungry feeling...it was a fun present and I loved it...and so did he.  He finally got a cell phone this weekend for his birthday!  That made me happy!  haha...but yeah other than all that its good.

But I am gonna go, its like 2:30 here and I have wonderful class in the morning! Hope everyone is doing well!  I miss you and love you all!

"event","The past two days have been THE BEST!  I packed for school wednesday and finished that up on thursday then Thursday night I went to good ol' Batesville, Indiana and had the time of my life! I know that seems highly unlikely considering it is Batesville...but it happened.

So I think I am in love...I don't know...I am not totally sure if I want to label it yet, but I can say that I adore the most wonderful guy in the world and he adores me back...or so I found out Thursday night...this adorable guy I have known for about 7 years, we met at church camp one crazy summer (because church camp always makes a summer crazy!) and that was back before good old email was introduced to the Stafford house-hold so he and I kept in touch with the good old SNAIL MAIL until we would see each other the next year at church camp...we wrote letters back and forth for 2 summers and then email came into play and we kept in close contact all the way up to second semester of college when I would talk to him everyday.  Of all the people I got close to and all the people I met at church camp he is the only one that I still talk to...I don't even talk to the girl that went to my church!  But for some reason I kept in touch with only him...and I am starting to figure out that reason I think.  So I went to see Philip last night and I haven't seen him since March...so I drive the good 45 minutes to see him and when I got there I was nervous!  I don't get nervous!!!  So we went out to dinner and when I was following him to his house to drop off my car, I had to call Anthony because I couldn't function, Philip looked SO HOT when he rolled up in his red Explorer (love the SUVs!) and he is so toned, and tan...man!  Whhoooo! Anyway so I had to call anthony because I knew he would laugh at me while I laughed at myself...so we get to Philip's house and we decided to go to dinner and I was nervous that we wouldn't have anything to talk about at dinner...once again I don't get nervous about stuff like that...because hello I always have something to say...but it turned out GREAT...I laughed so much and I don't think I stopped smiling the entire time.  
Oh on a side note...we went to a golf course restaurant and on the back of the place-mat it said in big letters at the top ""Who is God and How did we get here?  We can tell you:""  then the entire back of the place mat explained that in full detail...I thought that was interesting, wondering if that was ever offensive to anyone, because they may not be the same beliefs as everyone in that town.

Ok back to the story, so after dinner we went to his Grandparent's house because I had to pee and he wanted me to meet his grandparents...they were SO NICE! His grandma was the best ever...she told me I wasn't aloud to call her anything but 'grandma'...I LOVE IT!  and his grandpa came down a little after I had been talking to his grandmother and she introduced me and he said ""Oh are you the girl from church camp?  I have heard a lot about you and seen many pictures, its nice to finally meet you.""  I think I died when he said that he had heard a lot about me.  After his grandparent's we just went driving around...surprisingly I had so much fun, I just love to spend time with him, we were going to go walking in the park but there were a lot of people there and he didn't feel like walking once we had gotten there, so we drove!  Then after we drove around we went back to his house, which smelled of peppers and tomatoes because his parents were making homemade salsa, it was cute.  So we went upstairs and hung out, he called his friends and figured out what was going on for the night and he decided that we were going to go to ""his land"" he calls it.  Which is land owned by his other grandpa that he goes out on every Thursday and has a campfire with friends and just hangs out and drinks a bit, so we go and get stuff to go out to ""his land"" (hehe that makes me laugh) and we were the first ones out there so we unloaded wood from the car and he started to build a fire...and might I add for some reason he looked SO HOT doing it!  And then we star gazed a bit and then he sat by the fire and his friend Brandon came...he is a cool guy, then his friend Chris came...this kid was futchin hilarious!  He entertained me all night!  Ok so after Chris got there he was talking to me asking me questions and stuff and he asked me how Phil and I met...then Brandon proceeds to say ""Are you serious!?  You know how they met!""  then Chris says ""Oh, is this the church camp story"" Brandon: ""Of course it is.  He talks about her all the time""  That made me so happy!  Well after awhile and a fews drinks, I had to pee and we were nowhere near a bathroom and so when Brandon offered to go get something to eat, I offered to ride along so i could go pee...so we go to get food and Phil and Chris stay at the campfire.  Brandon turned out to be a cool kid, we got to talk in the car, and he is really nice, if cara didn't already have a BF I know she would like him...so when Brandon and I came back Philip and Chris were playing with the fire...of course, and they said that they saw a shooting star while we were gone!  I was so jealous!  I LOVE shooting stars and you are supposed to make wishes on them and they are really special wishes and I asked Philip if he made a wish and he said he did and he told me that it better come true!  So of course I wanted to know what it was and of course he didn't tell me. Well when 11:11 rolled around I made a wish too...and it was for a goodnight kiss...OF COURSE!  But I didn't tell him, I just told him it better come true! So the night goes on and it is just the 4 of us and I had no problems with that, I love to hang out with guys, especially Philip, and there was a campfire, and stars, and I had a blanket...I was in heaven!!  Midnight rolled around and I was supposed to be home by 1, well then 12:45 came up and I finally decided to go home.  Philip took me back to his house to get my car, and it was too cold outside for his baby self so we said goodbye in the car...we had a long special hug across the center consul haha and then stupid small talk all the while I was hoping my little wish would come true, and as I was leaving I asked Philip what his wish was, and he bashfully smiled and pointed to his lips a little embarrassed and I laughed and told him that that is what I wished for too...I thought it was cute...but needless to say, both our wishes came true!  HOLLER!  But I really didn't want to leave him and the night, it was so awesome!  But I did and I got home by 2, Philip led me out to the interstate because you can only figure out the Batesville back rodes if you live there...me...NO!  haha so Philip went totally out of his way to lead me to the interstate...that made me happy once again.

So all in all it was a very nice day.  Sorry that I just went through all of that, none you probably really care, but I haven't been this giddy and happy over a boy since ooooohhh EIGHTH GRADE!  I feel like I am in middle school again!  It is such a funny feeling!  I couldn't stop thinking about him all day today...I had a smile on my face all day and everything I saw made me think of him!  

GOOD TIMES!

"event","Okay...so I woke up this morning kinda weirded out!  I  had a dream within a dream....and it was about Suessical!  We all got to the theater and we were getting ready to go on, and someone had come in and changed all of our costumes, and the bird girls couldn't find their costumes...and it ended up Tori in gold, Lacie in yellow and I was supposed to be in purple but my dress was MIA! And we had these weird head pieces...they were like a hat and feathers and rocks.  Tori is fully dress in her bird girl costume...Lacie is in her yellow dress with a blue feather boa and Mayzie was in a green purple and pink and gold dress, then I was in street clothes and the costumer refused to find my dress...so I put my hat on and missed my first entrance and I was frantically trying to find my boa so I could have something purple and the costumer gave me a string of purple pipe cleaners and told me to use those as a boa, then gave me this mask with purple feathers that went over my face and squeezed it when I put it on and I started freaking out and I passed out because I couldn't breathe!  Then I woke up from passing out and I was laying back stage in my bird girl outfit and I think it was Seth...he was yelling at me because we were about to go on and I was asleep.  But then when I went on it was an entirely different show...it had to be Newsies or something because it was all boys dressed in Newsies outfits.  Then I woke up for real!  Isn't that the most random thing?  Whew!

OKay I am a jerk...Gibby told me a long time ago that he would take me to see Merry Wives up at BSU and introduce me to some people there and I was very excited to go and I didn't know when we were going, he mentioned during the week and we never really made definite plans...wel I just read his email, after getting his comment and he wanted to go up Saturday night and see it and one of his friends was have a slumber party and PS I LOVE SLUMBER PARTIES...and it is a chance to meet some of his friends who have to be fun people...and I really want to go, but as you can see in my LJ entry from yesterday I made plans with David thinking that I had that night open and I now feel really bad!  Because I haven't gotten to see, and hang out with David in about a year and a half, but I told Gibby that I would go to see this show with him...I really want to do both I just feel terrible!  AAHHH!  Maybe I can hang out with david earlier in the day and then go to BSU with Gibby that night...damnit!  I am so sorry GIbby...you were first and promise I will check my email daily now!  

But I have to go, the girls and I are going to lunch and then out of the day...its my last day!  and I can't wait until tonight!  Its going to be so fun!

Have a good one y'all! (I am already talking like I am back in KY...YIKES!)

"event","One more day of work and I am done...then I will get actual summer time for the next 2 weeks, then it is back to school YAY!  Back to school where I will be crashing in my old roomie's apartment because UK f-ed up my housing!  But I am excited because I miss her and living with her!  We actually kept in pretty good contact this summer!  I am going to Chicago a week from today and I am so very excited about it!

Ooo hold on I just remembered I have to schedule a hair appointment!  Hold on...
Alright...my hair appointment has been made, I wanted to get it cut before I went to Chi-tizzle to see Cara, but oh well, I am getting it cut the day before I move back to school so I can have a hot new fresh look for all the girls in my sorority...ooo, yay...hhmm.  That is another reminder...I need to go shopping for all my sorority crap!  We have to wear specific out fits everyday!  Oh well...its an excuse to go shopping and get new things!  

So its been nice having free nights since Suessical got out...I have gotten to hang out with my fam the past few nights, and I actually liked it!  Not that I have a problem with my family but usually I would go out with friends if I had a night free, but the past few I have just wanted to be with my fam, and it was nice.  Tonight I am the date for a friend who is singing at a restaurant in Keystone.  I am excited to see him sing but I don't know what to do when he is singing, because he is not my boyfriend and this isn't an actual date...he has a girlfriend, he is my ex, and I have no new interests in him.  But we are still friends so we hang out.  Tomorrow night I am going downtown with a bunch of friends and actin' a fool!!!  I am excited!  We are going to get a hotel room and go and get ready meaning dress crazy like morons and then go out for a night on the town!  I am soooo excited!  It is my group of friends from high school senior year!  Holler at your IC!  hahaha

And the best news of all...my ex that was going to come to my show...missed it because he had a double header on both Saturday and Sunday...the story of our lives...but its okay because we are going out Saturday night!  AAHHHH!  I am so SO SO excited!  Its about damn time kids!  

Well the girls and I are going out to lunch and dropping stuff off at Goodwill so I gotta run!  Hope everyone is having a joyous day!!  

Lots O' Love

Good song!  So Suessical is over and man did I have a blast!  I never really got to tell everyone how much fun I had with them this summer!  SO here goes...

Matthew Renskers: You make me laugh so much!  It was so great how we were BFF from auditions on...haha and I can't wait to come see you this year and then get a house with you!  Man I love you!  I love how you got me the most random but best presents!  The gum and the bubbles because I am uber-delighted by both!  I am so glad that I got to know you this summer and I can't wait for our summers and years to come!

Claire: Amazing! That is the word that I will forever use to describe you in all aspects!  I have learned so much from you!  You are such an amazing person, your personality just makes me want to be near you (that and the GIGANTIC crush I have on you!)  You really do inspire me daily!  You have such an impact on people and I am honored to say that I have been one of them!  I look forward to working with you in the future and to hanging out with you, I will miss you a TON (but not so much because of my shrine with candles) and I will mis the Clover Hunt!  I love you to death!  You truly rock my face off!  haha  

Gibby: I have known you practically all my life, but I got to know you even better this summer and I am so thankful for that!  You really are a big brother to me, and I will always love you for it!  Thank you for all the rides, I couldn't pick another person to ride all around Indianapolis with, you made me so comfortable in a place where I was a bit intimidated!  You made me feel like everything was going to be okay!  I will miss you dearly, but I know I will see you!  I love you big bro!

Lacie:  Another summer...I had a blast with you, and I hope it was the same for you.  You know I love you and always will...even when I am far away, I miss you more than anything when I am not around and I wish I could be here with you more to share experiences like this.  I will be at BSU a ton next year and I will be looking you up every time and more when I am there! You are the moon to my stars. With all that I am and all that I dream to become...    Bottom Left my darling!

Jeremy: Wow..what can I say, my killer rack and I admire you so much!  You really are what I want to be.  I want to be a teacher and to see you take over our down time at rehearsals and make something of it and be so respectful to everyone and be so good at what you do really really makes me admire you!  I love you to death and I had a BLAST with you in this show!  I am dying for the next show I get to be in with you because I know it will be amazing!  You were my favorite last year in Ragtime and you are definitely on my favorite people in the world list!  haha  I love you and hope you have an awesome year!  I am coming to see Chorus Line since I can't be in it!

Denise:  You crack me up!  I am still looking for your damn B Day present, I think I am going to have to resort to something else...I have another thing in mind, and one day when you come home from work, you will see something on your proch...chained and locked to the rail of course so it is not stolen...and there will be your birthday present FINALLY from me!

Haha!  I love too to death and I will miss you, but I will be up to see you...no worries!

I am going to miss you, but like you and practically the rest of the cast, I will definitely call up when I go to BSU!

"event","You may be thinking about the show by looking at the title of this entry...but really it has to do with that awesome game that everyone played!  The game that predicts your future! Hard Core props to Denose for thinking to play it! Everyone at Steak N Shake played, meaning...Craig, Ryan, Shmegan, Matthew, Joe, Denose, and myself...the rules were that we had to pick our future husbands or wives from the people at Steak N Shake.  I married 3 people there...haha all the guys except for Craig, I think...did we get married Joe?  If we did you must fill in our future in the comments, I think I don't remember because I was still picture my naked ass driving an ice cream truck!  HILARIOUS!  My future with Matt was hilarious...we lived in an apartment in Cairo and he drove El Conqo and his job was a professional stunt midget and we had 7 kids...nice huh!?  My future with Ryan was pretty damn good...we had 437 kids and we lived in a PHAT pimp house haha (aka a big one) and I was a professional nudist (whatever that is) that drove an ice cream truck!  We all decided that since I was a nudist...Ryan probably wasn't the father of all 437 children that I had! But it did probably explain why infact I had 437 kids haha!  Then after MASH we were getting ready to pay and I got out my credit card and tried to hold it to my lips by sucking in, like the game suck and blow...and I really couldn't get it and at one point I breathed in and ""Oops my mouth farted!"" haha so after many failed attempts to play suck and blow with Matty and my credit card, he thought his (which was the exact same card different numbers and shit)would be better, but once again, we failed, so then Ryan had this great idea of using the receipt and IT WORKED!   I felt complete after that!  haha

I just have to say this one thing...JEREMY YOU MAKE MY DAY!  EVERYDAY!  The past few times I have seen him he has made me feel so happy.  He told me I looked beautiful yesterday and that really means a lot...and then the other day he told me that I make him very happy...I LOVE hearing that from people...and I LOVE Jeremy haha!

So Suessical went pretty well last night!  I got the tap!  YES!  And a few friends came, I hadn't seen them in a long time so it was nice!  My close group of friends is coming tonight!  I am muy excited!  And I get paid today...this is a pretty happy day...AND I am talking to the love of my life right now could this be better...what?  NO!

Oh yay!  He knows my favorite city in the world is New York and he thought of me and almost got something for me when he was there!  AAAHHH!  and he might be coming to the show!  Ok this is Joanna on a ""GIDDY school girl with a crush"" high!  On that note I think I am gonna go!  haha"

"event","Ok so last night I was at rehearsal carrying on a conversation with Lacie and Seth and the next thing I know my pants, or shorts rather, were around my ankles...a split second later I realized I didn't have underwear on, I screamed and quickly pulled them up.  Then I proceeded to almost pee my pants with laughter after telling Clur (the pantsing culprit) that I didn't have underwear on.  Now, when I wear these shorts I usually wear a thong, because I get MAJOR wedgies if I wear regular underwear (I know you are all interested in hearing this) but I couldn't find one so I went with out....now I kinda regret it, BUT I was in a dark corner, and I don't think anyone saw anything...but still to this moment I can't stop laughing when I think about it!  And to Clur...hahaha, all I can say is next time you want pull my pants off (which is every day, I know) you might want to check with me earlier in the night HAHA!  But it is all good because every one can laugh about it.  


I wanted to go to G Fizzle's last night but I am glad I didn't.  Let me explain... when I got home, my little bro had a bit of a problem that he needed my help with.  He got in his first wreck...but it was with our tree!  Haha and me being the QUEEN of wrecks (I have had 4, with damage, but 6 technically, and no I am not proud of any of them)  but he just got his car on Tuesday and by Wednesday he ran it into one of the trees at the bottom of our driveway and busted out the rear lights on the right side of the car and left a few  dents and scratches.  And by him looking back on what happened to me when I got in my wrecks...he FREAKED OUT...so I was there to tell him the run down of what would happen to him...haha, its funny but also sad.  I was glad I could be there for him though, that made me happy!

I am excited to do the show again tonight, I know a few people that are coming, so that means I kinda have to look cute afterwards...damnit!  My Baby Anthony is coming tonight...by himself!  I just can't explain how much I adore him...he is like a boy version of me except he is gay too, so he is the boy and partly the girl version of me haha!  

I am only the nanny for one today instead of three girls.  But the one I have is the 8 year old which when she doesn't have a playmate and she wants to swim in the freezing cold water (that is kinda dirty because her dad hasn't cleaned it) and I don't...she gets whiny!  So I told her she could invite a friend over and none of her friends are home.  I feel bad for her.  She is my favorite, yet at the same time I have the most trouble with her, because she does not listen to a word I say!  Seriously...when I tell her to do things, I have to make her repeat back to me what I just said so I know she heard me.  Isn't that terrible.  I think she is used to not listening because she never listens to her parents and they don't do much about it.  Oh but you better believe that I do.  Haha you know it is sad when you are disciplined more by your temporary nanny than you are your parents.  OH WELL!  I hope these girls have learned something from me this summer.  I worked on a certain thing with each one...Grace to listen better, Madallyn to not automatically raise her voice and make everything into a fight, and Virginia to clean up after herself.  They have gotten better but I only have a week and one more day with them, so I don't think it will stick...damn!  haha 

Well I better get back to entertaining the little one...I think its time for lunch and a movie!

COME SEE SUESSICAL!

"event","My job is very interesting...I think I am getting paid to just make sure the girls do their chores and to run errands for the family...otherwise I get to hang out all day!  My girls are so independent and really don't need someone to be watching them 10 hours a day, they just need a person with a car to be their biatch and take them places hahaha!  Don't get me wrong I like working here its just that some of the days I feel like I could be doing better things with my time, like cleaning up my room at my house and starting to get things re-packed to go back to school!  AAAHHHH my summer is ending so fast...I go back to school in 3 weeks....WHA???  That is nuts...stupid sorority stuff!  Not really stupid but sometimes I think it is stupid to do rush BEFORE school starts.  We'll see.

So Seth had game night last night at his house and I was all prepared to go, I even went out to dinner with a few cast members before and on my way to drive to Seth's I got the dreaded call from my mama...""I left something at home that I need for my party, will you bring it?  Oh and will you pick your brother up from rehearsal?""  So I had to drive out to New Pal to give my mom some present she forgot for one of her girls, and then come back home and wait for my brother to call and be picked up...he got his car yesterday, I guess I just wasn't understanding why he couldn't drive to rehearsal himself...and I must say I do love the car.  My family has now become the number one fans of Ford Explorers...we have 3!  Haha each child has one, and they just keep getting better and better!  But Snow White (MY car) is the best!  She is hard core!  haha.  But anyways...back to the story...so after I pick up my bro, I try to call Gibby to get directions to Seth's, I kinda remembered but I needed to make sure before I ventured out.  Haha, well he didn't answer and then I called Lacie and Seth and didn't get any answers, so I decided to stay home, not really feeling like getting lost in random neighborhoods up on 96th st.  But I got a surprise visit from my Best Friend in the whole wide world Anthony Hare!!!  Haha That boy lights up my life.  And I was really in need to talk to him, I have been tossing around the need to confront a problem for about a week now and he gave me the reassurance that I could do it.  Now when I actually do it, I have no idea...haha so SOME progress was made, just not much!  What a loser!  haha kidding.  

Alright well I better get going, the girls want to go to Waffle House (random I know) for lunch, and its food OF COURSE I am game!!"

"event","So last night was Denise's Bday!  Oh how fun it was!  First we went to Buca, and after driving in circles trying to find parking I finally did, in the garage RIGHT NEXT DOOR!  I felt like such a moron!  So anyway, I went in and first person I saw was the old kitchen manager of the Buca in Castleton!  BLAIR!  Damn he is still so hot!  I loved him...he was a great guy.  During dinner I shared macaroni rosa with my baby daddy (he is having the baby) Craigory, and Ryan Mullins (I LOVE YOU)!  Then after dinner we went and took a picture and I posed with Chris Arthur...we are now going to prom together, because we definitely took the ultimate prom picture hahaha!  Then after that Me, Ryan, and Craigory took Denise to my car  and she had no idea...because we blind-folded her, because we were off to the second leg of the night.  She got in my car thinking it was Craig's car and then I was driving around down town...trying to get to Washington St while ryan throws an open box of tampons all over my car!  I wasn't aloud to make noise because of Denise to I had to laugh and yell at Ryan silently haha it was so funny, until I realized I was on ""Check Gage"" (for gas) and I still hadn't found Craig's car and I still ahd to go home and get gas!  haha!  But then I found it and everything was okay!  Then we began the second leg back and Claire and Denise's!  That was fun...we played the 90's Trivial Pursuit game and the young team would have won if everyone didn't randomly stop playing!  Haha...but we were kickin ass I must say!  And yay for Matt Renskers (my BFF) for World Wide Pants!  haha  But we all sat around and hung out and just had so much fun!  I would like to say I love drunk (and sober, of course) Jeremy!  And me and Jeremy are Miller Lite buddies now!  And I got to braid Clur's hurr...haha it was special...aka it sucked, but it was really funny...she liked it I know it!  But yeah I was one of the last people to leave, and I shouldn't have been because when I had to got up this morning, oooo I was movin slow and feeling everything from the 5 hours before!  haha  

I LOVE THIS CAST!

"event","So I finally jumped on the Live Journal bandwagon...I know, I know I shouldn't do it because everyone else is, but everyone else was having so much fun with it!  I'll try anything that seems fun...well, not ANYTHING, but a lot of things.  

So I have been doing Suessical for what seems like my entire summer.  As are a lot of other people that have live journals (hence the ""everyone else"" that has one)  And at first, I didn't realize it until recently, but I was very shy about the whole thing...believe it or not I can be shy!  But, I was shy and intimidated because of the age of the cast and the relationship of a lot of the people going in to the show.    I mean what young, less experienced person, wouldn't be intimidated with this AMAZINGLY TALENTED cast!  These people are so awesome!  It makes me wish that I had spent more time with them after rehearsals!  Every time I went out I had a blast.  I was just so tired all the time I never did.  I didn't put forth as much effort to get to know people through out the rehearsal period as I usually do.  And I don't know why...I guess coming back from my first year of college and missing everything I had left, I was wanting to experience something new, but still have the life I had before I left, with the people that I left here.  I shouldn't have thought that way, and now I realize that and I am trying my best to hang out with everyone as much as possible!  I am going to be a little late to Denise's birthday party tonight because of work!  BOO! And I hate that, because I don't want people thinking, ""oh she doesn't care enough to come on time, she is too good for the cast""  or something like that...but I know they don't think that because they all work, they know what it is like...right?  ha! 

I have realized that I love doing shows like this for the experience and the people.  You get so much just from the people!  And I would just like to say I have learned a lot from this cast! We have a group of so many different personalities that compliment each other so well.  I couldn't even begin to try to put it into words!  Just know that you guys are AWESOME and I have learned so much from each and every one of you!

This is why I have made that oh so big decision about transferring to BSU.  This is my passion and whether I am in the back row behind a guy that is 6'5"" or in the front with a solo, I want to do this all my life.  I get such a rush and a feeling that I cannot get somewhere else. Performing a show with great people, knowing that we all worked our butts off to be where we are that certain performance on that certain day, its just a amazing!!  I am transferring in the fall of 2005, because good ol' UK (I will love you dearly haha) doesn't offer a Musical Theater degree!  Boo on them for that, but yay for them for everything else!  It is a wonderful school!  

Well that is all for my first entry...I have to go be a nanny now I can hear a fight brewing between two of them! haha!"

"event","My roommate Anthony taught me how to make this. It takes a bit of preparation, but it's so good and it makes enough to last awhile.


ingredients:
one whole butternut squash
one bag of red lentils
one can of coconut milk
some fresh ginger
one yellow onion
several cloves of garlic
tumeric
yellow curry
one lemon
salt



Skin the squash and remove the seeds. Cut the squash into about 1 inch square cubes. Slice the onion. Boil the squash and the onion for 20 minutes. Drain the water and set the squash and onion aside.

Follow the directions on the packet of lentils, it usually takes about 30 minutes to cook. Add the following ingredients to the lentils while they are cooking: coconut milk, garlic, curry, tumeric and ginger. I put about 2 tablespoons of the yellow curry and one tablespoon of tumeric, but you can do this to taste.

When both the squash and lentil mixtures are done, take out your blender or food processor and put equal parts of both mixtures into the blender or food processor and blend them together. You may have to add a bit of water to aid in mixing and you will have to do this is several batches because it will not all fit in the blender at once. Put the blended mixture into a big pot and when all of the indredients have gone through the blender, add the juice from one whole lemon and the grate the lemon rind into the mixture. Stir the mixture over low heat for a few minutes until all the ingredients are blended. Now you just need to add a lot of salt, I have never measured out how much I use, but I just add it until it starts to taste good."

I've been pouring over articles and information on both sides of the Israel/Palestine issue, trying to find something to link to that summarizes the situation in a balanced way because I want to share this with those of you who are interested in some background information. It's hard to find writing that isn't biased towards one side or another. The tone of many articles tends to be shrill, and bordering on hysterical for both sides. There's little point in my trying to summarize because there's simply too much information to process. I've found a couple of good articles that make some interesting points. Jews who come to the defense of a free Palestine tends to be labeled as self-hating, but as this article titled <a href=""http://www.mediamonitors.net/timwise1.html"">Reflections on Zionism From a Dissident Jew</a> by Tim Wise points out, the roots of Zionism itself are self-hating. Take these quotes:

<b>
anti-Semitism ""is an understandable reaction to Jewish defects.."" - Theodore Herzl, founder of modern Zionism

""each country can only absorb a limited number of Jews, if she doesn't want disorders in her stomach. Germany has already too many Jews."" - Chaim Weizmann, former President of Israel
</b>

Since I'm neither a politician nor a historian I only have a very basic understanding of the issues, but I do think it would be interesting to consider what would happen if role of religion was taken out of the claims of either side, if a solution was based purely on politics and economics. Mubarak Awad has a good quote about this in his interview titled <a href=""http://www.peacemagazine.org/archive/v04n6p05.htm"">Nonviolence in the Middle East</a>:

<b>
""Neither Israelis or Palestinians can feel superior. No one can say that he is a dirty Jew or he is a dirty Arab. That has to disappear. We can do that. We have to eliminate most of the traditional feelings - that God gave me this land, or that God is telling me to do this, or that this is all mine.""</b>

<img src=""http://www.palsolidarity.org/main/wp-content/100_0240.JPG"">

Non-violent resistance has the effect of moving the occupied people to a higher moral ground than the occupier. A comment on non-violence by <a href=""http://www.fas.org/irp/news/2002/03/aq032002.html"">Sari Nusaybah:</a>

<b>
""...nonviolence requires a great degree of courage, discipline, determination, and clear vision and strategy, not  acquiescence, surrender, and cowardly avoidance of confrontation. On the contrary, it requires confrontation because it is a popular battle using nonviolent means. In addition, this battle cannot bet on the other side's abstention from using violence against the first one. Nonviolence is based on the assumption that the opponent will use violence and all forms of bestial practices, and on violence rebounding on the interest of the opponent. This is why nonviolence requires a great deal of organization and courage, a high degree of commitment that even entails sacrificing the self, and highly advanced tactics.""</b>

Some amazing societal changes have happened as a result of non-violent resistance, the civil rights movement in the US, the liberation of India from British rule, the WTO protests in Seattle. It has been my dream for a long time to continue this tradition on an issue that I feel very strongly about.

If the American public only has one side of the story, we cannot expect anything to change, we cannot expect our leaders to do anything but continue to support the violent occupation of Palestine. But if we work on educating our citizens of the realities faced by people everyday, people just like you an me, then I believe change can occur. It's occurring, albeit at a snail's pace, in the US now in regards to the Iraq war. Once the truth starts coming out, people will not accept the violence that an occupying nation commits against the occupied people. I've been very inspired recently by meeting and talking to other <a href=""http://www.palsolidarity.org"">ISM</a> activists who have volunteered in Palestine and I am looking forward to my trip."

I still *really* need to raise more money for this, I am a little bit short of what I need, so if you were thinking of buying a print, now would be an awesome time to do so. You can view stuff for sale at <a href=""http://www.theopticnerve.com"">www.theopticnerve.com</a> and click on the ""Buy Prints"" link. Again, if there's something else not listed for sale that you would like, email me and I can get it made for you.

There's a podcasting company who wants to broadcast my misadventures and supposedly they're going to give me an iRiver to record stuff.

Thanks to everyone who has supported me so far. It means so much. I'm beyond excited about this.

I called the pharmacy at 520-323-2695 and was referred to the corporate office at 623-907-4932. I called that number an left a message asking the same question. I doubt I'll hear back. But maybe if they get enough calls and enough bad publicity, they'll fire this person for not doing her job.

If her eldest was 6, that would make her 16 when she had the first. She probably dropped out of high school. She's a single mother, trying to live on her own in San Francisco, one of the most expensive places to live in the country, with three kids, no education and apparently not much help from her family since she lived in a homeless shelter.

I can't imagine being 23, with no education or skills, and homeless with 3 kids. I can hardly think of anything worse than that.

I'm not claiming this woman is in any way innocent. I'm pointing out that if we leave our struggling family members on their own, if we, as a country can allow a 23 year old mentally ill mother of 3 to be homeless, then we should not be surprised that this is the consequence.

People who cannot take care of themselves and whose families will not take care of them should be taken care of by the state. Her kids should have been given to someone who could take care of them. It's uncivilized to expect a schizophrenic to take care of 3 kids."

"event","Tonight I saw the documentary <a href=""http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0507/S00344.htm"">Fallujah 2004</a>; I wish every American could see this film. It's worse than you could even imagine.

According to the residents of Fallujah interviewed in this documentary, the resistance in Iraq isn't foreign fighters, it isn't Al Qaeda, it isn't the remainder of Saddam's boys, it's regular citizens who are sick of their people being murdered and bullied and who are defending their homes and their cities. And they have every right to do so, according to United Nations Resolution 2908 which states:

<strong> ...<EM>Reaffirms</em> its recognition of the legitimacy of the struggles of the colonial peoples and peoples under alien domination to exercise their right to self-determination and independence by all the necessary means at their disposal...</strong>

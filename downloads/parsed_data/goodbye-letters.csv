"event","So wow, i'm actually updating this. it's been a couple of weeks. i won't get into some of the shit that happened because it's in the past and i'm over it. lately, things have been going really great. i was introduced to a girl last week, and we've been talking a lot and we're really hitting it off well. her name is Kristen. she's going to be a sophomore at the Art Institute at the University of Hartford. Good times. Things are going really smoothly and I think it'll head in a good direction.

Things with the band have been going the same. Which is great. We're still writing songs and soon (maybe even as soon as next week?) we're going to start to record our songs. We're going to go for 8 atleast, and those same 8 songs we'll play at the show in August. I don't have a solid date for that show yet. But it'll be good fun. We're going to hopefully have some merchandise to sell there, so that's gonna be cool.

Not too much to update on really. I'm still not working many hours. I really do need to find a new job.

Mini Golf tomorrow! and perhaps bowling, which should be interesting, because i've never gone. Oh well, it'll still be fun."

"event","so it's been a really long time since i've updated this. i graduated from high school on saturday. i really don't feel any different though, it's weird. i'm sure it will though when all my friends in grades below me start to get ready to go back at the end of summer. so like always, i read my horoscope when i signed on this morning...and this one really hits me...but in a very good way. not everyone will understand why though...

Is the religion you follow one that truly speaks to your heart, dear Taurus? It can be easy to simple follow suit with the traditions of your family or culture. Yet, the faith you choose needs to be one that you can identify with. Even if this means breaking the mold, it may be something you'll be glad for in the long run. Research what's out there. This is a good day to start.

very good. well...i'm getting ready to go out and spend some money i think, cause i have a lot."

For some reason, you have gotten boxed into a situation in which there seems to be absolutely no way to escape. Remember that there is a way out, but that it may not necessarily be even remotely related to the way that you came in. Instead of using your energy to get upset and frustrated by it, channel this energy towards solving your predicament."

Tension may be brewing in this area of your life and it might cause you a great deal of frustration if you are not more accepting and receptive of those who are trying to get through to you. Take a few risks and free yourself from the control of things that seem to be holding you back. This is an extremely expansive time; so don't blow it by sitting around and doing nothing.

""Perfect Situation"" by Weezer
What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain.
There's the pitch, slow and straight.
All I have to do is swing
and I'm the hero, but I'm the zero.

Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable.
'Cause I could not have it better,
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto.
I just pass through...

Get your hands off the girl,
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company.
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander...
Can you blame her?

Tell me there's a logic out there.
Leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come.
Tell me there's some hope for me.
I don't wanna be lonely
For the rest of my days on the earth.





i hate myself so much right now."

<B>23</B>
I felt for sure last night 
That once we said goodbye 
No one else will know these lonely dreams 
No one else will know that part of me 
Im still driving away 
And Im sorry every day 
I wont always love these selfish things 
I won't always live not stopping


It was my turn to decide 
I knew this was our time 
No one else will have me like you do 
No one else will have me, only you 

Youll sit alone forever 
If you wait for the right time 
What are you hoping for? 
I'm here I'm now I'm ready 
Holding on tight 
Dont give away the end 
The one thing that stays mine 

Amazing still it seems 
Ill be 23 
I wont always love what I'll never have 
I wont always live in my regrets 

You'll sit alone forever 
If you wait for the right time 
What are you hoping for? 
I'm here I'm now I'm ready 
Holding on tight

That's going to be a long boring task. But once I get started it'll be a lot easier. We all agreed that we're going to practice again next friday, but I kinda want to see if maybe we can practice two days...because I don't want to stop now.

I have to do my CI paper this weekend. That shouldn't be too hard though. It was a fairly easy assignment and I can say I definitely learned some helpful tips. And it'll be an easy paper to write, because it's not like I have to persuade anyone on a topic, I just need to write what I've learned. The hardest part will be inline citations....i HATE inline citations.

Feelings of warmth and affection may be strong for you today, dear Taurus. You seem to be feeling a renewed appreciation for the people in your life. It can be a good day to express your feelings to many of those on your mind. Everyone from coworkers to friends and family are likely to be delighted by a smile or a kind word of caring from you. Let others know that you appreciate their presence in your life.



so basically...if these horoscopes were so accurate, i should have waited until today?


i know i shouldn't listen to them, but they're all too accurate. so i'll continue reading them.

things that have happened lately:
got my haircut
got new sneakers
bought a prom ticket (...)
got the hell beaten out of me during kickball

the paf went well friday. it got over in 2 hours, which was really nice. then afterward my brother, alex and myself went to walmart to buy star wars stuff (yes, we did.) and then we went to wendy's for alex. then once me and my brother got home we played our new star wars monopoly. until i was too tired to play anymore.
saturday, woke up...got some AMAZING news. then i left for GREEN DAY!!!

we got there really early but went and ate. when we got back we waited in the rain for over 2 hours. but there were some entertaining people hanging around, so that was alright. My Chemical Romance took the stage at around 8....and as soon as i saw Gerard and Frankie wearing bullet proof vests, i knew it was gonna be bad. not to mention Frankie's X's he painted over his eyes. thankfully they only played 5 songs. they were honestly SO bad. after one of their songs, when it was real quiet i yelled out ""YOU SUCK!!!"" and since i was in the third/second row, they heard me and Frankie flipped me off. I just wasn't impressed with their performance...no one was. Green Day took the stage at around 9 and played a full 2 hour set. they were AMAZING!!! what sucked though is during their first 2 songs, atleast 12 people that were in the front had to leave because they were being crammed in there to much...including myself. but i was still on the floor and almost just as close as i was, so it was still great.

Billie Joe introduced himself as George W Bush. that was funny.

so yah...got home around 1:30...fell asleep around 2....then had to get up and go to work for 5 hours. and now i'm really tired. but i have to go do some homework, so that's all for now."

anyways...Muse was AMAZING. razorlight...not so good, but they tried...so i'll give them that. there was this one kid 2 rows ahead of us...that was...possessed...exorcist style. that doesn't even explain him. he was moving all around really oddly...and kept like, grabbing his head like he had voices in his head that we wanted to go away. Matt (Bellamy, from Muse) came out last, and the rest of the band had already started playing, and he came out, and was eating a banana and looked as though he was confused on where he was and how he got there. but they were really good.

sadly, i don't have any pictures. i tried to bring my camera in, but i got frisked and was told to bring it back to the car.
so yah...that's all."

The desire for an intimate encounter with a love partner should be stronger today than it has been for a long time, dear Taurus. You're not only feeling passionate and sensual, you're probably also feeling very romantic, like a fairy-tale princess. If you're currently involved, schedule an evening alone with your partner. If you're single, however, this could pose problems. You may have to settle for a romantic video and a long hot bubble bath!


i'm not actually going to comment on this...however...fairy-tale princess??? wtf."

"event","so today was quite the day. i had a photo/journalism field to uconn. it was ok. the point of the field trip is to take picturs...and write...i guess...but they also try to throw in issues with diversity. but their attempts at that fall short. put a group of all white kids from one school and a group of all black kids from another school together in the same room, and they're automatically going to stay in their respective groups. i mean yea, the idea's nice...but we're talking about a bunch of teenagers, so you can't expect much out of us.

anyway! on to the highlight of the day...
we got a lunch break, and luke and i went up to ms. blair and asked ""um...can we walk to the jorgensen to buy tickets for a muse concert?"" and...she was like...""i don't see why not, you can take care of yourselves. it's gonna be quite a walk though."" so i was thinking, okay, no big deal, i can handle a walk. so i go over and look at a map. turns out, the jorgensen was way the fuck on the other side of campus. well...we walked it anyway. got there...bought 4 tickets and went back. then, when we got back, we were told, ""you know, if you just cut behind that building there, you could've gotten there a lot faster.""

...


oh well though, i don't care, it was worth it. even though my leg muscles are killing me."

"event","my horoscope for April 11, 2005:

You might find yourself in a bit of a gridlock today, dear Taurus, unless you can somehow rise above the current situation. This is one of those days in which you may find yourself in a classic battle between the real and rational versus the ethereal and fanciful. Both sides have their weapons out, shields up, and share an equal unwillingness to budge in their position. Try to see the good points in both sides of the conflict.

i think my dad is going to get me a psp for my birthday. he left a magazine on my computer desk that has all these games that are coming out for it and tells you how to take care of it and whatnot. either that or he's just teasing me, which is stupid.

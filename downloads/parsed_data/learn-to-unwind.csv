"event","I&nbsp;had my first surgery yesterday.&nbsp;<br />It was an incredibly overwhelming experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ive been meditating on Psalm 139 lately, and just generally exploring the sovereignty of God.&nbsp;<br />And the idea that every day has been foreordained before one came to pass.&nbsp;<br />That God has complete knowledge of every event; past, presently unfolding, and those yet to come.&nbsp;<br />So as I sat in the waiting room, I wondered; why this day?<br />Why did God choose this day to be apart of my story... <br /><br />As the surgeon and assistant came in and numbed my side, preparing to remove a large portion of my skin.. I found myself overwhelmed by fear, anxiety, and anger. <br /><br />I was angry because my body was defected, and I&nbsp;was suddenly aware of how truly fragile my body is. It was at risk for death (however unlikely that may be, it is still a risk involved), or serious pain if the disease unfolded, and I had NO control over the situation whatsoever. Its like my body has a mind of its own, choosing to do whatever it wants.. <br />I was fearful of the potential pain. One, I didn't trust the anesthetics. She just shot me up and then she wanted to start cutting right away. AND to top it all off I&nbsp;was awake during the entire procedure......&nbsp;<br />And I was anxious for obvious reasons. <br /><br />I put in my iPod and landed on some Hillsong.. the shuffle landed on You Hold Me Now... <br /><br />and this is why this day was placed strategically in my story.<br /><br />As I listened to the lyrics of the song, my mind wandered to eternity. <br />The entire song is written about longing for heaven. <br /><br />The pain that I was feeling is not natural. My body is not created for pain, and with all of creation it groans to be redeemed, and transformed into a glorious form. <br />While laying on that surgical table I found myself engulfed in worship, longing deeply for my Savior to transform my body. <br />I found myself yearning for heaven <br />and in the midst of pain, fear, and discomfort I found myself COMFORTED in the hope of what is yet to come. <br /><br />The reality is our pain drives us to praise God, draws us into Him. He is our refuge, our help in times of trouble, discomfort, uncertainty, and pain. The entire situation yesterday was a reminder to set my sights on heavenly things, and to keep myself from investing all of who I am on this earth. <br /><br /><h6 data-ft=""{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;msg&quot;}"" class=""uiStreamMessage""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span class=""messageBody"">&quot;We  cannot look fixedly on Christ &amp; the world; the eye cannot look  upwards &amp; downwards at once in a direct line.&quot; -Issac Ambrose</span></span></h6><br /><br /><div id=""refHTML"">Thankful that God uses unexpected situations to remind us of the Truth.</div>"

"event","I love working. <br /><br />It is the only place in the world I have a chance, and the excuse, to interact with the world. I get paid to interact with an unpredictable variety of people. <br />some are regulars, who order the same items, sit in the same seats, wear the same clothes, and make the same small talk. <br /><br />Some situations are extraordinary, where small talk, leads to big talk, and were having a discussion about our mutual love for Christ. <br />For these reasons, and all the ones that fall in between.<br /><br />I love working. <br /><br /><br />Yesterday while I was working a mother and her young son, probably about 4 years old walk up to my register. I greet them with my usual overly enthusiastic welcome. <br /><br />The son is chattering away about sprinkles, &quot;I want one with sprinkles!! sprinkles&quot;<br />The mother turns to me, after scanning the bagel wall, &quot;do you have any bagels with sprinkles?&quot; <br />&quot;No, sorry..&quot;<br />&quot;I figured..&quot; she says as we both walk down towards the bagel wall, she picks her son up so he can get a better view of the choices. <br /><br />She asks me which bagels are sweet, and I tell her the options, but the son eyes the whole grain bagel, which is decorated with small white oats, which, to a four year old, resemble sprinkles.To everyone else, we know this is the exact opposite.<br /><br />&quot;I want that one!!!!!&quot; He points to the whole grain, excitedly. &quot;That one mommy! I know i want it&quot;<br /><br />she explains to him that he doesnt want that one, it isnt what he thinks it is. Its not sweet, those are not sprinkles.<br />the boy cries and continues to demand the bagel, he has made up his mind, and strongly believes this is the best choice.<br /> however the mother chooses to purchase a cinnamon crunch for her son. the boy throws a temper tantrum.. still insisting on the bagel with &quot;sprinkles&quot;<br /><br />I wonder how many times we do this to God.. demanding and pleading with Him <br />Begging Him to give us what we want <br />What we think is good, but in reality, HE&nbsp;KNOWS, is not what is best for us.<br /><br />We beg God for relationships we think are beneficial and will provide the most satisfaction and joy, but in turn hurt us the most, and lead us down a path of sin and bondage. <br />We plead for a career that will provide comfort and will sustain our lives, but will lead us only to be self-sufficient, and consumed with an insatiable love for money that invades every area of our life. Overriding the importance of everything else.<br />We lay our plans, our thoughts at His feet, and pray that He bless them, and work them out peaceably.. when from His perspective, none of these things are healthy, or good.<br /><br />But how many times are we like this young boy, whose perception and understanding of a bagel were limited by his <strong>experiences</strong>. <br />He was young <br />and inexperienced <br /><br />We are young <br />and certainly inexperienced <br /><br />His perspective was skewed by his age<br /><br />when his mother withheld, what in <em>his eyes</em> was a good thing, he got mad, and sad. <br />however, the mother knew that this is what was best, the boy wouldn't be satisfied in the end with that bagel, it wouldn't bring him joy or peace or contentment in anyway<br />the boys desires were valid, however his choice was wrong.<br />there was something better, and because she was more knowledgeable, she had to make that decision for her child regardless of his feelings<br /><br /><br />can you imagine the joy the boy experienced after biting into that bagel, realizing this is <strong>exactly</strong> what he wanted. <br />his anger and sadness cease<br />and he develops a deeper trust in his mothers judgment. <br /><br />his experience was fully satisfying, not a hint of dissppointment<br /><br />What are the things we want most? <br />How does this apply to those situations?<br />Do we trust God's plan and Sovereignty vs. our limited knowledge, experience, and vantage point?<br />When God withholds something, how do you respond? In trust or in anger?<br /><br />Do we understand and believe that He does not withhold one good thing from us, but makes all things work for the good of those who love him and are called according to his purposes. <br /><br />He is Holy, and His ways and thoughts are higher. <br /><br />If God has removed something from your life, or is withholding something that seems, 'good' from you. Consider this: what seems confusing or difficult, makes sense to Him; our why's? (&quot;why mom wont you let me have that bagel that I want and think is good for me...?&quot;) are accounted for, and make sense to Him-- as He is all- knowing, loving and good in everything!!! Can you trust this truth? and rest knowing you are taken care of, even if it doesnt make logical sense to you. even if all the pieces arent fitting perfectly together right away.<br /><br />that young boy was probably mad at his mother for five minutes after they sat down. Im sure he refused to take a bite, his mind still set on the other bagel. <br />how many times do we do this? <br />dwell in anger, or depression, instead of being open-handed and trusting God's guidance and the truth that HE&nbsp;MAKES&nbsp;BETTER&nbsp;DECISIONS&nbsp;THAN&nbsp;WE&nbsp;DO!!!!<br /><br />So as you evaluate your desires, aspirations and plans, be fully content in every situation, knowing that even if the details don't make sense, God is far more experienced, perfect in wisdom, and perfectly Sovereign.&nbsp; God too, has to act in certain situations the way the mother did towards the son, removing or withholding a bad thing/decision from us because they foresee/KNOW the end result. <br /><br />He is Good <br />He is Perfect <br />He is your Loving Father <br />Trust Him.<br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","<div class=""copy""><p>If you have known me for any amount of time really, you know that I have been wrestling with this issue for quite sometime.</p> <p>I fast from Facebook, and often delete it altogether.</p> <p>Ive felt this conviction for far too long. I have wrestled with it.  set it down altogether. but mostly I justified my way through the whys  and why-nots. making excuses, all the while consciously overlooking the  signs, and ignoring the inklings.</p> <p>but ultimately, here I sit. and these are the conclusions I&rsquo;ve reached:</p>  <p>I utterly despise the amount of time I WASTE on Facebook. I was  challenged by a line I read in the book, &ldquo;Running into Water&rdquo; by Angela  Blycker, it reads, &ldquo;Our moments are eternal deposits. They must not be  wasted.&rdquo;</p> <p>Im challenged by scripture too, that tells me I was bought with a  price, and because of this I must honor God with my body. (1 Corinthians  6:20)&nbsp; However, if I, in my entirety, was bought with a price, wouldnt  it make sense that I should honor God with not only my body, but with my  mind, and my soul, and my TIME too?</p>  <p>So I began to evaluate how much TIME I spent on Facebook. I started  justifying my time spent on the site by &lsquo;ministering&rsquo; to the world via  status updates filled with scripture and encouraging messages, or  through uplifting wall posts exclaiming how truly valued my friends are,  and that I was in fact, praying for them.</p>  <p>It seemed legitimate to me, I could never delete my Facebook, because that is how everyone <em>connects</em>.</p> <p>I pondered this thought. do I truly feel <em>connected</em> to those I communicate with on Facebook, and do they HONESTLY feel connected to me?</p> <p>We &ldquo;connect&rdquo; on Facebook by &lsquo;posting&rsquo; on &lsquo;walls&rsquo; or &lsquo;liking&rsquo; a status  update. We sometimes let people in by posting notes. Honestly, the  interaction on Facebook is instant, surface level, and cheap.</p>  <p>As I wrestled with these convictions about Facebook I felt motivated  to take a fast from the site, or sometimes delete it for an indefinite  amount of time. I was dissatisfied with the way I was spending my time,  and the OBLIGATION I felt to the site. I felt, that I would lose contact  with friends if I dared to back away from the social networking site. I  would &lsquo;miss out&rsquo; on events or even inside jokes. Most of our humor is  channeled through wall posts, where one can think long and hard about a  cunning response. You essentially can hide behind the identity you chose  to create, and find instant gratification from doing NO WORK in your  friendships.</p>  <p>As I took all of these risks and scenarios into consideration, I  realized that I was simply doing myself and my friends more harm, than  good, by continuing in these patterns of behavior. Not only, was a being  a poor steward of my mind, but of my time, and of my calling. Instead  of &lsquo;Facebooking&rsquo; in my dorm late at night, I could be spending time in  the dorm rooms of the many girls in my hall (who ironically, will  probably be &lsquo;Facebooking&rsquo; the entire time), instead of clicking through  hundreds of pictures of someones wedding that I dont even know, I could  be reading a book, or even DOING HOMEWORK?!?! Instead of &lsquo;Facebook  chatting&rsquo; during class, I could actually pay a wise Professor respect,  and allow my mind to be engaged during a lecture.</p> <p>The examples are endless.</p> <p>Our moments are eternal deposits. How are you choosing to invest them?!</p> <p>I realize, that my friends, the girls I am disciplining, or  mentoring, and my family, deserve much more than a post on a wall, or a  message in their inbox. In fact, I would even dare to say some  ministries hide behind these mechanisms; this instant and easily  accessible source of communication. Because lets face it calling someone  requires far too much work, and certainly puts you at an inconvenience.  For example:</p> <p>Lets take your average christian wall post: &ldquo;Hey girly! Hope all is  well!! I was just thinking about you and wanted you to know Im praying  for you!! love you!&rdquo;</p> <p>Now, take that wall post and transfer it to a real life conversation.  Instead of &lsquo;posting&rsquo; on a virtual &lsquo;wall&rsquo; you decide to CALL this  person. And in turn, they end up spilling to you all that is REALLY  going on in their life, and lets face it, that might cut into YOUR time.  Sadly, most people wouldn&rsquo;t dare to risk sacrificing time.</p>  <p>I am realizing, that my friends deserve my time. In some aspects my  friendships should not be entirely convenient, or easily accessible.  They derserve to be invested in, and cared for, nurtured and fostered.  In order to maintain and cultivate my friendships, I should be required  to make an effort outside of a &lsquo;wall post&rsquo;. And you deserve that too.  Our realtionships were CREATED to be meaningful!!! Not cheap and easy.&nbsp;</p> <p>With those convictions deep in the soil of my heart, I say goodbye to  this social networking site, and start down the journey of breaking an  addiction. An addiction to being instantly gratified by the attention I  receive from notifications. I say goodbye to an empty outlet to fill my  time, and numb my mind.</p> <p>I say hello to hard work, and deeper relationships, to discovering  new things, and being a good steward of the time entrusted to me on this  earth.</p>  <p>Our moments are eternal deposits. We are not guaranteed tomorrow, or even the next breath. How will you invest them?</p>      <p>.</p></div>"

What happens when we start praying for the impossible?&nbsp;

Steven Furtick has started an incredible ministry, or rather, God through him.. calling us to embraces the dreams God has placed inside of us, and pray audicious prayers and live out an audacious faith 
I stumbled upon the kick off last night where he preached for 24 hours!!! Today I started sifting through the prayers, the sun stand still, impossible prayers and this broke my heart:

My prayer is for my future wife. That God would continue to bless her,  guard her and prepare her, as he is doing with me. I long to grow into  and become the husband and father he created me to be. One that will  lead her and always pursue her passionately - ab

this is the cry of my heart, for my husband! and how encouraging is it to know that my future husband is praying the same prayers about me. 

I recently decided to stop hiding that part of my heart from God, but rather embracing that it truly is a desire of my heart to have a husband. So here is my sun stand still prayer:


I pray for my future&nbsp; husband. I ask that you are protecting him, shaping him, working in him, and leading him to me. I pray for our ministry together, that the cry of our hearts would only ever be to serve You and love You and make your name known on this earth! I pray that our hearts would break together for the things that break yours and He and I would be able to discern Your specific call on our lives. I pray that we would serve as missionaries together. Whether in another country or in our neighborhood, we would partner with you on mission. I pray for our children, that they would come to know that you are all that matters in this life, that they would develop an intimate relationship with you. Protect their purity. Shape me Lord into the woman you have called me to be. The desire of my heart is to be the wife, mother, and Christ follower you have called me to be, and&nbsp;I know I can only do this with your strength and your grace and your loving Holy Spirit. Thank you Lord in advance for the grace you will pour out on our relationship, Thank you for him God, I thank you for your faithfulness. I love you Jesus, and husband I love you, and I am so thankful for you. I will wait for you, I will wait on the Lord."

Tomorrow marks the beginning of a new season. 
What an incredible season it has been 

As I start this new one I want to focus on a these truths:

All of my life, in every season, You are still God, I have a reason to sing I have a reason to worship: No matter what happens in this next season, no matter what struggle, or pain, or confusion, or heartache, no matter what loss or accomplishment, loneliness or companionship. God is still God, He is still reigning in sovereignty over all the earth. No matter what. He deserves my praise. No matter what, I still have a reason to praise. Because He freed me from my debt, and brought me back to life. 

Anything and everything pursued outside of Christ is meaningless- I must pursue everything under the Lordship of Christ. If my marriage, or schoolwork, or job, or friendships are not being pursued with a godly fervor then they are meaningless and essentially worthless. I&nbsp;must do all that I do for the glory of God and furthering of His kingdom . He is all that matters in this life. 

Keep an eternal focus- NO matter what. Heaven is my home. Invest only in things of eternal purpose. 

Probably more to come.. but those are a few things 

God I am so thankful for EVERYTHING you did this summer!!!!!! Every good thing, every perfect thing, came from you. From Your hand!! I am so greatly blessed, beyond what i deserve or could ever imagine! You bring immeasurably more than I could ever conceive or create! !!! Thank you for protecting me, thank you for restoring me, thank you for walking with me through this summer. Thank you for delievering me, thank you for comforting me, thank you for challeneging and shaping me. Thank you for guiding me and providing for me&nbsp;

Oh God, You are my God, and I will ever praise You!!!!!! 

Thank you 
Thank you

If ill ever be free from these thoughts 
Free from these things that hold me down 
and&nbsp;I mean, truly, free

I let you get inside my head 
You 
You 
You 
I should have guarded my heart 
and only let You in 

But instead 
I started down a dark path 
From which I had to turn back 
or rather 
cut through the dark 
Thick brush of a lonely forest
The only way through is found by following Your light 

I made it through 
To find myself here 
Where I wander around 
haunted by the memories of the past
Scared from the falls I took during my journey through the woods 

I cannot tell for sure If ill ever be free from these memories 
You say there is no condemnation in Your light 
But You never said anything about memories 
I know that scars fade with time 
But they never truly disappear 

The pang in my heart 
The wince in my soul 
When I see a name 
and it triggers a memory 

Memory 
Leave me alone 
Memory 
Stop beckoning me 
To follow you into the dark 
Into the past 
Where coffins lie 
and the old me remains 

I am new 
I am transformed 
The old 
Gone 
Dead 
Forever 

One thing I do:
Try as hard as I can help it 
To forget the past 
and press on toward the goal to win the prize 
In which You have called me, 
heavenward

So here I go
Keep 
Moving 
Forward"

Staring into the depths of her eyes. Seeing only what was right in front of me. <br />Imagining all that her eyes had captured over the years<br />The memories, the pain <br />the sorrow <br />the guilt <br />the sin she allowed herself to become entangled in <br />the grief she bore from past relationships <br />abusive parents <br />dissapointing friends <br />and the hopelessness deeply embedded in her heart from years of buying into the counterfeit this world has to offer<br /><br />As I looked into her eyes, and watched her watch me, <br />I listened closely as she slowly peeled back the mask <br />and layer by layer began to reveal herself <br />it wasnt in explicit language <br />They were soft, subtle hints <br />of the beauty yet to be revealed <br />the deeper longings hidden behind carefully chosen words <br />and stories <br />all of which are motivated by a desire to know Christ, and be found in Him <br /><br />and as she laid her burdens down <br />mapped them out on the table that separated us <br />I realized I had a choice:<br /><br />i could be the priest:<br />and respond like this, &quot;Oh my goodness, I am so sorry that has happened to you. Girl, ill be praying for you.&quot;<br />Walk away, and never look back again<br />I could be the Levite:<br />and respond like this, &quot;Wow, thats hard, you know there is some scripture for that...But for real, ill definitely be praying for you&quot;<br />Thank God Im not her, and maybe remember her in my thoughts every once and a while.<br /><br />Or I could be the Samaritan:<br />and respond like this, &quot;I am terribly sorry, and I&nbsp;cant imagine the hurt you are bearing. In fact, I can literally see it. and I want you to know im here.&quot;<br />and then follow up the next day<br />and the next day<br />and POUR&nbsp;POUR&nbsp;POUR into that girl<br /><br />Heres the deal <br />We are responsible for EVERYTHING that is revealed to us. <br />You see, one day we are going to stand before God, and he is going to say something like this, in my case it will most likely sound like this:<br /><br />Ashley, remember Kara* (not a real name), remember when she revealed to you that she was struggling with an eating disorder, and insecurities, and she was abused and you heard her out, and then what happened????<br /><br />We will be held accountable for every situation we fail to LOVE&nbsp;others the way CHRIST&nbsp;loves us!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Which is a sacrificial, messy, LOVE <br />it requires diving in head first, throwing your whole LIFE into LOVING and reaching OUT to the poor and broken and HURTING not just praying for them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />In reply Jesus said: &quot;A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,  when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his  clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. <sup id=""en-NIV-25387"" class=""versenum"">31</sup>A priest happened to be going  down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other  side. <sup id=""en-NIV-25388"" class=""versenum"">32</sup>So too, a Levite,  when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. <sup id=""en-NIV-25389"" class=""versenum"">33</sup>But a Samaritan, as he  traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on  him. <sup id=""en-NIV-25390"" class=""versenum"">34</sup>He went to him and  bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his  own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. <sup id=""en-NIV-25391"" class=""versenum"">35</sup>The next day he took out two  silver coins<sup value=""[&lt;a

'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for  any extra expense you may have.' <br /><br />Luke 10:25-37<br /><br />Josh Riebok broke it down something like this:<br />the cool thing about Jesus' stories is that he leaves out the details.. he doesnt tell where those people are headed to or coming from, but you know that they are on their way... <br />Maybe one is on the way to the bus, coming home from work. <br />Maybe one is on the way to meet their family for dinner. <br />The first two, dont think this situation is important enough to STOP <br />they probably say something like, ahhh im too busy for this! Ill pray for you though! I have a lot on my mind, so i cant really deal with this right now. <br /><br />But the last guy, well you see, he was on his way too.. Maybe to a meeting, or on his way to work, or shopping. He saw a need and said THIS is more important. the other stuff can wait. <br />He saw<br />and recognized that HE&nbsp;WAS&nbsp;ACCOUNTABLE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;SITUATION&nbsp;BECAUSE&nbsp;HIS&nbsp;CALLING&nbsp;IN&nbsp;LIFE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;OTHERS <br /><br />and that doesnt mean praying from a distance<br />LOVE&nbsp;requires ACTION <br />it requires POURING&nbsp;YOURSELF&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;SOMEONE&nbsp;ELSE!!!!!!!<br />Maybe getting messy <br />When you love, the other persons problems become your own <br /><br />Bottom line friends:<br />Faith without deeds, is dead.<br /><br /><br />Brooke Fraser sums it up nicely<br />&quot;Now that I&nbsp;have seen, I am responsible. Faith without deeds is dead.&quot;<br /><br />This is a WARNING:<br /><br />One day, you will answer to God for everytime you turn away from a hurting brother or sister, and choose to sit on the sidelines, loving from a prayerfully safe distance. <br /><br />Jesus didnt simply pray for us. HE&nbsp;THREW&nbsp;HIS&nbsp;WHOLESELF&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;LOVING&nbsp;US! UNTIL&nbsp;DEATH&nbsp;ON&nbsp;A&nbsp;CROSS&nbsp;<br />WE&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;CALLED&nbsp;TO&nbsp;MODEL&nbsp;HIS&nbsp;LIFE and LOVE&nbsp;LIKE&nbsp;HIM!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

Ps. 147:11<br /><strong><br />Teach me your way, O LORD,  and I will walk in your truth;  give me an  undivided heart,  that I may <b>fear</b> your name. Ps; 86:11</strong><br /><br />I never understood what fearing the Lord meant. I would read verses like the ones listed above in Psalm and&nbsp;I would THINK I feared the Lord. I would even try to cultivate some fear. When I think about FEAR, it evokes some nasty connotations. In fact, my fear usually motivates me to do BAD&nbsp;things.&nbsp; In the past, my fear of failure kept me from trying. <br />My fear of being lonely kept me paralyzed in a intoxicating, godless, relationship, that poisoned my Spirit, my family, and God's work in my life for years . <br />My fear of feeling empty leads me to grab anything and everything that attracts my eye, and offers fulfillment, even if only temporary. <br /><br />My fear motivates me, and drives me, and yet, at the same time keeps me paralyzed. <br /><br />Throughout all of the trials, and circumstances the past nine months have brought my way, I have, as previously stated in about EVERY&nbsp;SINGLE&nbsp;POST, learned that TRUST&nbsp;IN&nbsp;GOD, is absolutely crucial, in a life/death sort of way. <br />Today I was explaining it to a friend like this:<br /><br />Ive gotten to a point, where I want NOTHING&nbsp;TO&nbsp;DO with anything that isn't of God. <br />If its not of God I hate it. I want nothing to do with it, in fact, I am afraid of it.<br /><strong>Because, I have experienced life out side of God's will </strong><br />I am now extremely TERRIFIED, to go back there. <br />I found myself in a recent situation that brought me to tears every night, begging God to remove the desires from my heart if they weren't of Him. <br /><br />After describing this desire to my friend, I realized, that I was beginning to experience, <strong>t</strong><strong>he fear of the Lord</strong>. <br />Only a Holy, supernatural fear, could repel me from evil, and spur me on in God's love and grace.<br />It is ultimately this recognition in my heart, that He is Holy and Sovereign. <br />Reigning high above my plans, or desires. <br />A respect of His ultimate authority, and submitting to HIS will, and HIS Spirit.<br />I believe, it may be the beginning of a great work of the Spirit, as my mind is being transformed and renewed, it is being shaped in the likeness of Christ.<br />The Spirit of the Fear of the Lord in my heart, has driven me to pursue only things over which Christ presides. <br />I do not fear this world, or wince at its pressures<br />I do not fear loneliness or its presumable heartache<br /><br />This NEW Spirit of Godly fear, has motivated me from the inside out, to die to sin and its slavery, and live in Christ and His freedom, submitting to His authority.<br />Letting go of my 'rights' and surrendering my ransomed life.<br /><br /><br />To fear the&nbsp;Lord is to HATE evil! Proverbs 8:13<br /><br />Im not sure how I got here, &quot;I cannot fix on the hour, or the look, or the words, which laid the  foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I  had begun.&quot;<br />My guess is that is started with love, <br />I think its safe to say thats where everything begins and ends and finds its purpose, wrapped up in the gift mix God has to offer<br />Grace, Love, Mercy, Kindness, Justice, Joy, Hope, and Purpose <br />All wrapped up<br />in the Cross <br />waiting for<br />you<br />to say, &quot;yes&quot;<br /><br />It has nothing to do with me being sweet <br />or a 'good person' <br />because in reality <br />Im a horrible <br />messy<br />confused <br />struggling person <br />Im not perfect<br />Im forgiven <br />Im am not any more deserving or worthy of love than anyone else. <br /><br />I said, &quot;yes&quot; and let Him take the lead. <br />This is simply the end product of gazing upon His beauty, <br />Watching my stains be wiped away <br />and my rags stripped off <br />my wounds kissed by grace <br />and my heart <br />finally started beating <br />REALLY beating for once in my life. <br />I stepped off the edge <br />and into LIFE. <br /><br />You have the option to do the same. <br />and you might be reading this, and in your mind there are fears racing <br />Doubts rising <br />'I cant get there, because Im here, and shes there.' <br />'I have my life, my circumstances, my issues, my parents, my finances, my relationships, my junk <br />there is NO&nbsp;WAY'<br /><br />Oh, friends, there is a way. <br />Grace has made a way<br />and its calling you<br />its calling your heart<br /><br />Lets talk about it... thoughts? <br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","..So now I can walk in your presence, O God,&nbsp;&nbsp;in your life-giving  light. Ps.56:13<br /><br />&quot;So give into Me, just say yes to Me,<br /> I just cant take it anymore, you gotta be mine, be mine.&quot; <br /><br />What an overwhelmingly awesome God we serve! Today I sit at Moody, studying away! Reading through 2 Corinthians, I busted out Encountering the&nbsp;New Testament to understand better the audience and their struggles, to get at the original meaning of the text. <br />The church in Corinth was mainly confused and inconsistent in their patterns of Christian belief and lifestyle. The largest city in First Century Greece, known for its trade, and pagan worship. Naturally, there were issues of conformity in this body. <br /><br />The underlying theme in 2 Corinthians is: The way of glory, is the way of the cross. <br />Theologians often speak of two different understandings of the gospel: theologia gloriae (theology of glory) or theologia crucis (theology of the cross). <br />Based on Pauls letters, its safe to assume, the Corinthians viewed Christ, and the Cross, as a way of self betterment, prosperity, and a way to power, success, and happiness. Their theology placed them at the center, rather than Christ. <br />However, the Gospel Paul was preaching, was centered around a symbol of suffering, and death:the cross, which was a MEANS to TRUE, LASTING, ETERNAL success, self-betterment ect. <br /><br />&quot;In service to Christ, the way to TRUE glory-- &quot;glory&quot; that elevates Christ, not man-- is often via dolorosa, the way of suffering&quot; (pg. 294)<br /><br />He talks about daily being given over to the death of Jesus, so that life may be revealed, (4:11) Godly sorrow brings us closer to the Lord (ch, 7) Paul boasts in his weaknesses and delights in his hardships, because he knows to be found weak, is to be found strong. <br /><br /><p>What a profound mystery!!&nbsp;I have found myself all too often falling to this same self-serving attitude. Thinking thoughts like: If I just do this for Christ, then ill get this..&quot; Thinking that God is some sort of vending machine, when I put in the right about of time, and effort, mixed with 'love' I get blessings in return. I am at the center of my theology and relationship with God, all too often. <br /><br />When we place Christ, in his rightful position. At the center, we find that not only do our 'worries' fade away, but we find ourselves peaceful and content. Gazing upon his love, and finding joy in sharing in his sufferings, because we know are made for something eternal, and this road marked with suffering, is leading us Home. <br />When we are at the center, life becomes about us, what a shallow life to live. Solomon understood that truly EVERYTHING is meaningless outside of Christ. <br /><br />Our lives, our happiness, our sorrows, our victories, and achievements, are meaningless if they are outside of Christ. <br />So when we place ourselves at the center, we naturally become discontent, anxious, worrisome, because there is something deep within us, that senses void, and knows our lives are meant for something greater. <br /><br />Sharing in the sufferings, so we may share in the glory. <br />Paul knew that the way to the glory of God, meant dying to ourselves, losing our lives so we may find it. <br /><br />How many of us serve Christ in order to get something out of it? <br />I fall fault to this. <br />I think thoughts like, &quot;I know im meant to do something great, and if I dont follow Christ, well chances are I wont get there.&quot;<br />&quot;I know God has my best plans in mind, so I am going to follow Him because I want those plans&quot;<br /><br />If our basis for serving Christ is ourselves, no wonder we fizzle out after a captivating message, or a moving worship service. <br /><br />While leading worship at the Jesus Culture conference, Kim Walker says this, &quot;without (the love of God) it these are just songs, words instruments, without the love of God is like were just up here just making noise, but the love of God changes us, were never the same after we encounter the love of God, were never the same... You would know if you encountered the love of God, because you would NEVER&nbsp;BE&nbsp;THE&nbsp;SAME! So you better just brace yourself.... because when you encounter the love of God you'll never be the same!!!&quot;<br /><br />Its the love of Christ, the love of the Father, that moves us to serve, to suffer to endure. and without the LOVE&nbsp;of God, this Bible, is just a book, its just words on a page. <br />Without the love of God, church is just a gathering place for the pharisees.<br />Without the love of God, I am a just a random heartbeat, living, only, to satisfy the desires of my flesh. <br /><br />With the love of God, I am a child, I am an eternal being, created to glorify the eternal King. <br /><br />So if our faith is centered on us, were not experiencing God. <br />and if our faith is centered on the cross, the we are overwhelmed by the display of love it represents, and naturally respond with full surrender! <br /><br />Oh He loves us! Oh how he loves us!<br /><br />I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power  through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts  through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in  love, may have power,  together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and  deep is the love of Christ, and  to know this love that surpasses knowledge&mdash;that you may be filled to  the measure of all the fullness of God.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoC1ec-lYps"" /></p><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","Home. 
Ann Arbor. 
What an adventure the past nine months of my life have been. 
I&nbsp;remember so clearly, driving up to Cornerstone, with my Dad and my sisters, my mom in the other car, lugging all my stuff up. My first few days, terra firma, the people I met, the feelings I felt. 

The things that were to come. 

Three words to descibe this year:
PAIN 
PERSEVERANCE 
SOVEREIGNTY

Pain-I spent the majority of the first semester fighting Gods will for my life, wrestling his mighty hand until i finally, finally surrendered. 
Perseverance- After the surrender came trail, struggle, the desert. An extended season of loneliness, where God chose to reveal&nbsp; Him self to me in HUGE ways everyday.. I learned lessons about fasting, prayer, trust, and most importantly, this entire season was devoted to processing everything I went through.&nbsp; I learned to persevere even in my loneliness and brokenness, in the midst of this wilderness. 
Sovereignty- God is sovereign. I dont really need to unpack that, but i will. This year, God has continually disciplined me, and showed me His ultimate control, and plan over my life. Down to the last few days, teaching me to trust always. Trust. because he has a plan. Way higher than mine.

Mmmm 

I am highly anticipating a season 
packed full of trials 
to be honest 
because i am so hungry for intimacy
and that comes through relying on God,
having a deeeeeeeeeep relationship with Him 

&quot;lets survive this together 
Weve survived SO much together 
already 
I want to live through this with you&quot;

The more I go through with Him, the more He becomes my husband. 
My partner 
My best friend. 

I want to LIVE&nbsp;through THIS with YOU! 
i want to go through everything with You God!
Holding YOUR&nbsp;hand, no one else's

You complete me.
You complete me. 


So beautiful Mercy, do what You have to do 
You know the best way
Beautiful Mercy, do what You have to do 
To bring forth Love in me!

I will sing, even in this wilderness 
Teach me how to sing for You 
Only You"

"event","So tonight, I realized this crazy thing, while in evensong. 
Its like the Holy Spirit shook me 
Literally, awakened my soul 
and revealed to me the schemes of my enemy
The lies I am believing 
the condemnation 
the accusation 
the fear 
the doubt 

The pride I am bearing 
The flesh I am fighting 

&quot;Its not my voice 
Its not my voice
Dont believe the LIES beloved
Im singing over you 
A song of freedom 
A breath of grace and mercy&quot;

How prideful was I to tell God what I think is best for my life??!&nbsp;
There I was, finding myself entangled in sinfulness yet again
Where did that freedom go?!?
It was suffocated by FEAR thats where! 
Fear consumed my heart, and I let go of the truth 
I grabbed the wheel, going a hundred and twenty miles an hour 
And lost control 
Because these are fragile roads, 
Dangerous conditions, 
and i need the direction of the Only One who can control my situation 

Into Your hands, I commit again 
All I am, to You 

What was i thinking?!?!&nbsp;
Ahhh.. 

Oh the folly of the past, though I know it is undone 
I still feel the guilty one still trying to make it right 
So i whisper soft Your name, let it roll around my tounge
Knowing You're the Only One who knows me 
You know me 

Thank You for Your grace that allows me to press on 
Forgetting what is behind 
and looking forward 
Taking each step with You 
in Spirit 
Thank You 
I am Yours"

Just take it day by day, walking, trusting, knowing I will get there.. and that I cant plan my steps or know exactly whats going to happen, however, I know that the ONE who knows, LOVES me, therefore He will take care of me.. <br /><br />Alleluia, All I have is Christ, Alleluia, Jesus is my life.. <br /><br />Thankfully I have nothing else but Jesus, there is no one else for me but him, and I am glad to have his love and only his love as my source of hope, strength, and validation.. <br /><br />But i began to realize, that my dreams, this dream filling my chest, is not a 5 year period of my life, where i &quot;live the dream&quot; and then settle down into an average life.. this dream is cultivated, nurtured and developed over the years of my life, its a life long dream of God. <br />For the furthering and advancement of His kingdom <br /><br />The dream, is now <br />It is here <br />Its my LIFE, not a place<br /> Presently, its my life today my living breathing, encouraging, loving, serving <br />it is now <br /><br />Mmmm.. good things, good things <br /><br />I am also realized my TRUE&nbsp;motives for seeking out relationships, for emotional validation.. i have these insecurities that I long to be fulfilled, and cast out by truth I long for a man to speak this encouragement into my heart... <br />Youre beautiful, Youre talented, so godly, inspiring.. ect.. <br /><br />However, I am recognizing, that Jesus Christ can fill these insecurites, I need to have TRUE, dependence and securitiy in GOD&nbsp;alone. Before I can ever consider having a relationship again... Because truthfully that man WILL&nbsp;NEVER&nbsp;fill me the way Jesus does (and can).. <br /><br />ultimately, knowing that He thinks im beautiful is more than enough.. THE&nbsp;CREATOR&nbsp;OF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;UNIVERSE&nbsp;THINKS&nbsp;IM&nbsp;BEAUTIFUL... <br /><br />In chapel today Matt rapped for us! some incredibly powerful and convicting:<br /><br /> Give praise to King Jesus, the blessed Son<br /> Victorious, glorious resurrected One<br /> To Him belongs the power, glory and honor<br /> Ascended where He sits at the right hand of the Father<br /> At the cross He made atonement- His people He saved<br /> After three days He was raised in defeat of the grave<br /> By faith the elect behold Him, His scepter is golden<br /> He must have been hot or slippery because death couldn&rsquo;t hold Him<br /> <strong>The spotlight is on today&rsquo;s icons<br /> In a thousand years, nobody will care- their light&rsquo;s gone<br /> But at that time, Christ will still shine bright<br /> He&rsquo;s not in the limelight- He IS the limelight</strong><br /> Criminal minded, you&rsquo;ve been blinded<br /> Looking for the body of Jesus? You won&rsquo;t find it<br /> We never lack spirit, letting you cats hear it<br /> Because His tomb is empty like most secular rap lyrics<br /><br />Jesus Christ... The creator, author, the most famous one! HE&nbsp;thinks im beautiful! HE loves me! HE is enough... <br />I dont care if another worldly man tells me im beautiful ever again! <br />Who cares?!&nbsp;!?!?!&nbsp;Because the MOST&nbsp;IMPORTANT&nbsp;PERSON&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WORLD! IN&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;LIFE, AND&nbsp;THE&nbsp;NEXT, LOVES&nbsp;ME! LOVES&nbsp;ME LOVES&nbsp;ME<br /><br /><strong>He is all that matters</strong>, dear friends, nothing else matters. But Jesus, its all for Jesus <br />He has won, <br />and this world, and the coming age, its all about Him forever! <br /><br />Praise the Father who is over all, and through all, and in all!<br /><br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","<br /><br />&quot;Hey ashley not too sure if you remeber me but we used to be pretty good  friends when you lived in vandalia.  I'm sorry for not tryin to keep in  touch but a lot of stuff happened along the way for me.  All that is  beside the point though.  The whole reason im sending you this is that i  had the most intense dream of my life like a month ago and its been on  my mind ever since.  I have to tell you because for some reason its  weighing heavy on my heart.  In the dream i was a little kid running  around some huge building like a hospital or hotel or something.  Then  for no reason at all i just start following a girl who seems to be a bit  older than me.  Somehow i end up on a elevator with a third kid in it.   After a while a girl prolly in her twenties gets on the elevator when  it breaks down.  All of the children are begging this lady to help us.  I  guess all these details really dont matter but the rest of this dream  involves you.  As soon as I was thinking all hope was lost, somehow you  walk in the elevator with some guy ive never seen before. You then grab  his hand and begin crying, completely oblivious to me and the others on  the elevator.  You then walk out of a door in the elevator that i could  not go through.  I woke up completely covered in sweat.  While wide  awake i hear a voice that say &quot;tell her&quot;.  We both know who said the  words but my relationship with God isnt what it used to be.  I dont  think the dream was intended for me and since you are the only person i  recognized in the whole dream i feel like there is a message in there  for you.  I know it all sounds crazy and out of no where but i had to  tell you.  i dont reall use facebook but if there is anything you want  to say ill be checking for the next few days.  I hope that this in some  way helps you and that im not just some crazy person.  keep in contact&quot;<br /><br />Message recieved via Facebook <span class=""GBThreadMessageRow_Date"">April 1 at 11:47pm </span><br /><br />Note: I have not talked to this person in 5 years, since I&nbsp;moved from Ohio to Michigan, this is the first contact I have had with this person since. Also note, that we are not even friends on Facebook, they simply sent the message without &quot;friending&quot; me. <br /><br />Hmmm... thoughts?"

"event","About 8 months ago to this day, (coming up on a year!) I had an encounter with God, that was so striking, so real, that I cannot forget or ever look away from it. <br /><br />Gods message to me was, &quot;Its time to dream again...&quot;<br /><br />Over the past few months, I&nbsp;have been probing at this saying, this phrase, uttered from the mouth of the one I&nbsp;love.. wondering what this meant... <br />I though this was a one dimensional phrase, meaning its time for my heart to dream dreams about Him again, to allow my dreams to run wild.. dreaming big dreams about big things.. But i have began to realize this phrase might carry a few meanings.. <br /><br />Its time to DREAM again.. <br /><br />While going through my break up with Frankie, I stumbled through two weeks of nightmares. Vivid, life-like nightmares, where the emotions were high and intense. <br /><br />But since my encounter at Panera Bread, with those incredible people and praying constantly, my dreams have been guarded by the Holy Spirit, but I am also finding that my dreams are being guided by the Holy Spirit. Since these encounters, I have had weeks of vivid dreams, some of which are literal, others metaphorical. And I am finding that my dreams are mirroring my spiritual life, and that in that moment at Panera where God spoke again, those same words, &quot;its time to dream again,&quot; 8 months after he spoke them the first time. That this phrase has more than one meaning. <br /><br />So my dream last night.. <br /><br />started out kind of crazy.. I was with Frankie in a hotel, this part was more or less recapturing the past, emotions were high and guilt and regret were heavy on my heart and spirit...<br />the dream shifted and I was at Northridge, i was leading worship with Josh Collesano and there were these other girls. i remember feeling out of place, and then i got sick and no one really helped me, i remember feeling out of place and like i was reaching out but no one was there. then i started coughing up blood. everything i was coughing up was bloody<br />Then i was in another hotel <br />This hotel was HUGE and i was going through different rooms looking for people, i think that i was working there but I'm unclear on that part <br />then i got in the elevator, and there was a little boy in the elevator, and he was peeing, and i thought to myself oh great hes gonna be a creepy kid i just know it.. then two other kids appeared, a boy and an older girl and they were sitting on a cough eating pizza in the elevator<br /><br />then the elevator started freaking out, an alarm started sounding (possibly a fire?) and we were stuck in the elevator, the floors started flashing, and going crazy the floor numbers were rolling in a way (the way it does in cartoons on the cash register), like moving very fast and it would move to 1 and then start back at one hundred and the kids kept wanting me to get them off the elevator, and i started calling everyone i knew, but i couldn't remember the name of the hotel so no one could help me, i even tried calling my mom and i was like mom I'm stuck on the elevator please get me off of here!!! and then the doors opened and i could see the other room and the kids wanted me to jump but i was sooooo scared i just couldn't do it, the whole dream was panic and trying to figure out how to get out of this elevator <br />this went on for a while<br /><br />then this couple, walked from the other side of the room (the room i was scared to jump into) through the elevator, and into a door, <br />a door that was never there before <br /><br />and i looked at them and said hey!!&nbsp;was that there all along?!? and they looked at me, didn't say anything <br />and then walked down the stairs and i woke up<br /><br />there are MANY parts of this dream I don't understand yet, but from the thought I've put into it, I feel like it means.. <br />That i am in an elevator right now, and I'm struggling to get out.. <br />This elevator might be cornerstone for me, or it might even just mean life as i see it right now <br />The floors are moving crazy fast - the days are flying by and I'm afraid of how fast things seem to be moving <br />I can see the other rooms, the rooms i even long to be in- this might be ministry opportunities that seem unattainable (Africa, leading worship) or it could be marriage (trying to figure out who I'm supposed to be with)-- but these other rooms seem to bring comfort and security<br />all of the struggle seems to be a metaphor for my efforts that i pour into trying to create these things for myself <br />i am working SO&nbsp;HARD&nbsp;to get myself out of this place i am in, and into the next phase <br /><br />and then the couple walking through <br />this could be myself watching myself <br />this could be God showing me <br />that there is going to be a person <br />i assume this because the people did not interact with me, the didn't speak or look at me <br /><br />and then the door appearing and the people opening the door nonchalantly, and i ask hey! was that here the whole time?!??! <br />I feel stupid yet relived because my way out, was there all along, and all of my trying and striving and freaking out didn't create the door, the door just appeared and opened and i walked through--it was there all along, i somewhat, overlooked it<br /><br />I feel that through this dream God is trying to tell me that HE&nbsp;will create the door and open/reveal it at the right time! despite my striving and fighting and trying the door WILL&nbsp;appear and i cannot speed up or slow down the process and i will walk through it, wondering how i missed it all along, wondering why i was so caught up in jumping into the next room, when there was a door, with stairs the whole time <br /><br />also in the dream i was very scared of getting hurt, physically <br />i was afraid of jumping and falling down the crack between the elevator and the room <br />i was also afraid to move around too much because if i did then the elevator might fall off the track and i would lose sight of the room <br />fear is a common theme in my life right now <br />fear is driving and motivating me in the wrong ways, to do the wrong things <br />fear of LIFE is entangling and holding my heart captive<br /><br />anyway, the other parts of the dream could be showing me that i view myself as spiritually sick, as i am still struggling through sin and muck and nastiness and processing still, what i did, but the dream ultimately had redemption, because despite my lack of trust, despite my weakness, the door still appeared, and i walked through with ease. <br /><br />Hmmmm..,<br />its time to dream again?<br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

Im scared, but I know that youre in control. Am i ever going to stop feeling this way about Frankie?&nbsp;Am I always going to be attached to him?&nbsp;Is he right for me? Does he love me? Or do you have someone else?<br /> God I am so stressed about my major, I have no clue what I&nbsp;am going to do when I get older, I dont know what classes I should take next semester. <br /> God I am confused about this other drama on the side. Why do I compare everyone to Frankie?&nbsp;Is this situation right?

Or is there so much more?</strong><br /><br />Oh, dear friends... <br />Its time to dream again...<br /><br />"

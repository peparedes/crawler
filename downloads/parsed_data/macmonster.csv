"event","After taking a few weeks off to spend time to get to know my couch again I went on a hour long power walk and blistered my left foot up, ""hole in sock"" and now I am recuperating.&nbsp; 

I think I will unpack some boxes in the next few days, they been sitting in the living room, bedroom, dinning room and kitchen for about a year now so it's time.

I will look for a new job...sometime..maybe a week before summer vacation ends although it would be nice to win the lotto and move to BC for the rest of my life and spend the rest of my days on myspace.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the best one of the lot."

"event","I hate that feeling when I find something on the web but can't find it again...so normally the pack rat in me collects alot of stuff off the net but the one thing I didn't collect is the one thing I use constantly in Firefox.&nbsp; It's called LinkVisitor and it works like this, if you go to a page that has lots of links like a forum and you want to mark all the links as visited, instead of clicking on each one, you can right click on the page, select history, and select all links are visited and blamo it's done.

Well this Firefox extension hasn't been updated to work with the latest Firefox I have and I found someone who had altered the file to make it work but for the life of me I can't find this dude or this file and I needed it after a profile crash in Firefox but today I was able to alter the file myself successfully...Yeah Me!

I put the file <a href=""http://24.20.92.156:444/phpbb2/files/linkvisitor_works_on_1.5.xpi"">here</a> for safe keeping too.&nbsp; I don't want to lose this bad boy ever again.

<a href=""http://24.20.92.156:444/bbs/index.php"">PHPBB2</a> needed an update today and after clearing my head with massive quantities of java I successfully patched it...Yeah Me!

I have only this weekend left on my Christmas break, 3 weeks went by way to fast but I bought lots of toys for me to play with the rest of the year.&nbsp; I especially like my <a href=""http://www.steves-digicams.com/2005_reviews/s9000.html"">camera</a>, thanks Santas!

"event","The Gaels were some of the most accomplished intellectuals of medieval Europe. What follows is a partial list of some of their achievements:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Gaelic was being written by 600 AD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A census of Gaelic Scotland was taken in the 7th century AD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Cenn Faelad created a grammar for Gaelic sometime before his death in 679 AD, making it the oldest grammar in Europe for any language other than Latin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Adamnan composed the first international human rights treaty, The Law of the Innocents, in 697
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Gaelic (""Brehon"") law was assuming written form by 800 AD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Cormac mac Cuilennain (who died in 908) created an etymological dictionary for Gaelic, the first for any vernacular in Europe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Classical Gaelic - Europe's first exercise in intentional language planning - was in use in both Scotland and Ireland from c. 1200 to 1730
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Gaelic was one of only four languages (besides Greek, Latin and Arabic) in which medical knowledge was formally and systematically studied and taught in Europe during the Middle Ages.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The Book of Common Order was translated to Classical Gaelic and became the first book printed in any Celtic language in 1567

"event","I have gotten off my couch now several times...not what I had
planned but even the best plans of mice and men often go awry.

Things I have did....

1) showered
2) lubed the truck
3) built extremely fast xp box, now I got to figure out where to put it.
4) preped sisters pc for xp home
5) threw all the dishes away that were in the sink.&nbsp; Havent seen the bottom of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my sink for 6 months....hey I got something down there that stops the water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from going down the drain.
6) got some yummy peanut brittle from See's, and a electric tooth brush with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful rotational brushes....getting peanut brittle out of my mouth finally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from last christmas.
7) got extremely fast wireless router that broke my voip phone, was about to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toss the phone, internet speed more important, but found away to shut off
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firewall in the router that fixed phone...Yeaaa Me!

Well thats it so far....hopefully now I can rest peacefully on the couch for a couple
weeks."

"event","Just got through listening to my favorite weekly podcast.&nbsp; It's an hour
long show featuring Laura ""The Swish"" Swisher and Louise ""Weezy"" Palanker.
It's the <a href=""http://www.weezyandtheswish.com/"">Weezy and the Swish show</a>! In episode <a href=""http://www.computertroubleshoot.com/podcasts/weezy-swish004.mp3"">004</a> Laura starts it out with
her rendition of Oh Canada.&nbsp; Her former hit was the <a href=""http://24.20.6.21:444/phpbb2/swish/LupusSong.mp3"">Lupus Song</a>..thats right!

I think that Laura's voice has come a long way since the Lupus Song but
may have a ways to go if she wants to take on <a href=""http://www.williamhung.net/"">William Hung</a> in a sing off.

Weezy, on the other hand, actually knows the 'Oh Canada' song having seen
a hockey game or two up north.&nbsp; She also does a good job with podcast, she
seems to run the show which works well with Laura since the Swishes talent
is to play off of her.&nbsp; 

Their show has recently been compared to The View but funnier.&nbsp; I can't go
on without mentioning <a href=""http://matthartley.lockergnome.net/"">Matt Hartley</a>.&nbsp; He is a call in co-host and full time promoter
of the show.&nbsp; The ladies seem to make fun of Matts geeky side and you can
almost feel his embarrassment at times on the end of his phone.

I've saved all four episodes so far on my computer.&nbsp; I have a feeling they
will be classics some day.&nbsp; This show may may not be bigger then the
<a href=""http://www.bigbutton.com/"">Big Button</a> yet but just give it time and who knows how big it will be."

"event","<span style=""font-family: monospace;""> When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a course.

We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves, by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled.

The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.
&nbsp;
He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise.

He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which she had no voice.

He has withheld from her rights which are given to the most ignorant and degraded men - both natives and foreigners.

Having deprived her of this first right of a citizen, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.

He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.

He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns.

He has made her, morally, an irresponsible being, as she can commit many crimes, with impunity, provided they be done in the presence of her husband.&nbsp; In the covenant of marriage, she is compelled to promise obedience to her husband, he becoming, to all intents and purposes, her master - the law giving him power to deprive her of her liberty, and to administer chastisement.

He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the proper causes of divorce; in case of separation, to whom the guardianship of the children shall be given, as to be wholly regardless of the happiness of women - the law, in all cases, going upon the false supposition of the supremacy of man, and giving all power into his hands.

After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a government which recognizes&nbsp; her only when her property can be made profitable to it.

He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and from those she is permitted to follow, she receives but a scanty remuneration.

He closes against her all the avenues to wealth and distinction, which he considers most honorable to himself. As a teacher of theology, medicine, or law, she is not known.

He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education - all colleges being closed against her. 

He allows her in Church as well as State, but a subordinate position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from the ministry, and with some exceptions, from any public participation in the affairs of the Church.

He has created a false public sentiment, by giving to the world a different code of morals for men and women, by which moral delinquencies which exclude women from society, are not only tolerated but deemed of little account in man.

He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and her God.

He has endeavored, in every way that he could to destroy her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.

Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of&nbsp; this country, their social and religious degradation, - in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved,&nbsp; oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of these United States. 

In entering upon the great work before us, we anticipate no small amount of misconception, misrepresentation, and ridicule; but we shall use every instrumentality within our power to effect our object. We shall employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the State and national Legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the pulpit and the press in our behalf. We hope this Convention will be followed by a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country.

Firmly relying upon the final triumph of the Right and the True, we do this day affix our signatures to this declaration.

God also symbolizes an untouchable, unreachable, and unattainable notion of perfection. Thus such a dream may highlight your struggles and attempts with trying to be perfect. Dreaming that you are worshipping God means repentance of your actions and errors. Dreaming that God speaks to you means feelings of guilt, eternal punishment, and damnation. Dreaming that you are a god, implies your own special talents which you have not yet recognized or have not fully developed. Alternatively, it suggests your feelings of superiority over others.</td></tr></tbody> </table>"

"event","All those years -- 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 -- Christmas at the Herndon home had its very own St. Nick. Only it was St. Joe, Joe Herndon, sitting right in the middle, passing around the gifts. He looked goofy and handsome and wide-eyed and tender and sweet all at once. He had become the man of the house at 8 when his daddy fell dead from a heart attack. So there was Joe, passing out the gifts through the years, wearing his daddy's grin, which had become his own. <p>Last Christmas, ""no one wanted to do it,"" Virginia Evans, Joe's mom, says.</p> <p>""I had already bought Christmas presents for him,"" says his widow, Melaine.</p> <p>Gifts he never opened.</p> <p>People here say you'd meet Joe at some lunch or dinner and he'd corner you and start chatting you up and you'd feel like he'd been a friend for years.</p> <p>""I wasn't Joe's best friend, but I would have been honored to have been so,"" says Loren Flaharty, a big man who played football with Joe at Derby High and crumpled like a flu-riddled child when he had to tell his own tough dad that Joe was gone.</p> <p>It's a Friday night and Flaharty and some of his friends from high school are sitting around a wooden table at Buster's Sports Bar, slaking their thirst, munching on chicken wings, remembering old football victories and losses.</p> <p>Back when Joe was a local football hero, there was no picture of him in Buster's. Now his jersey is framed in glass on the wall, No. 56, with some snapshots of Joe, the soldier, tucked along the bottom.</p> <p>Funny thing: Buster's used to be the Derby Pharmacy, which is where Joe's dad, Ken, worked, which is why when Joe's mom is at Buster's, she can see both her son and first husband inside the place. It's what a small town sometimes is: the living and the dead close together.</p> <p>The train roared by just moments ago out there by Highway 15.</p> <p>Joe's stepdad, Gerald Evans, and Everett Barber, his grandfather, still go fishing at a little lake near Ellinwood. They'll take the road out of town, drive a little more than an hour, and there they are. They'll sit by the bank and cast their lines out over the water. Two men fishing, the sun shining. And what used to give them such joy now can give them moments of flat-out grief. ""When that boy died it just about killed his granddaddy,"" says Evans, speaking of Barber. ""All we do is think of Joe.""</p> <p>A family friend once told his mom that Joe could talk with his eyes, he could bewitch you with <i>the</i>m. Still, he complained that he could find girls, but not the girl. His mom said to find a girl athlete. So he began dating Melaine Long, who was a sports star in her own right at Derby High, playing basketball, volleyball and running track. He plucked some red roses from his mom's garden and put them on her windowsill. He took her for walks down by the river.</p> <p>On their six-month anniversary of dating, Joe got some Hershey's Kisses and put them on Melaine's car seat, spelling out I LOVE YOU with the candy.</p> <p>Melaine's dad happened to be Ray Long, the little league football coach in Joe's youth. Tough man, still robust, a football player for Kansas State University some years back. Football is important here. So what if the town doesn't have some lovely town square? It has a football stadium where the Derby High Panthers play and that is town square enough. The spirit of Derby is there Friday nights down on the field, where players crash through the night air. Joe internalized that bit of mythology when he was a little boy -- that someday he'd be much bigger, he'd be a Derby High Panther, he'd play linebacker.</p> <p>After high school Joe enrolled at Highland Community College in Highland, Kan. He aimed to play football, but his body had been banged up from knee injuries and concussions in high school. He began to wonder if he had any athlete left in him.</p> <p>Midway through that first year at Highland, he came home to Derby, feeling sick and lonely. His mom was waiting. Melaine was waiting.</p> <p>When 9/11 struck, Joe started talking about joining the Army. He talked about it through the holidays and Christmas afternoon gift-opening and through the Kansas winter.</p> <p>He enlisted on April 24, 2002. His mom drove him to Topeka, just the two of them in the car. He brought up the subject of dying and said if something happened he'd like to be buried near his dad. And if something happened to his granddad first, lay him next to Granddad.</p> <p>That Thanksgiving he was home on leave. He and Melaine were driving down Rock Road. Joe had the ring box in his pocket. It was his mom's ring. They got married in Las Vegas on March 5, 2003. Melaine was happy to get married but disappointed that they didn't have a big wedding.</p> <p>Why don't you have a big ceremony for the family in June? Joe's commander suggested after the Vegas I-do's. And Joe ran and called Melaine and told her that his commander had suggested a June wedding, which, to Joe, was code that they'd be flying off to Iraq soon thereafter.</p> <p>And so they married again, on June 6, 2003, at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Derby. Joe's family and Melaine's family and some of Joe's football friends attended. The Kansas sunshine was clear as white wine.</p> <p>His first Purple Heart was for a bullet wound to the shoulder.</p> <p>His mom had a mantra, which she imparted to Joe: ""Once you start something, don't quit.""</p> <p>That's what Joe reminded her of the first time he was injured, came home, and got ready to go back to Iraq: The job wasn't finished, he couldn't quit.</p> <p>His second Purple Heart was for a bullet wound to the leg.</p> <p>""Mom,"" Joe had said to his mom, on leave with his two Purple Hearts, ""you're not going to like this. But I don't have to go back."" She blinked. ""But you know what I'm going to do,"" he said.</p> <p>""Mom, I'm going to go back and finish the job.""</p> <p>Back in Iraq, it was July 29, 2004. There had been a firefight in Hawijah that day. They'd gone house to house. Six hours of battling, of fighting, of dodging bullets. Finally it was over, guns gone silent, dust settled. Joe's unit took a break. He climbed up on the back of a flatbed truck, just relaxing, a tired kid from Derby, Kan.</p> <p>Pow.</p> <p>It came from over there, no, over there, no, over there. A sniper. A single shot and Joe was down. The bullet slammed into his right ear and exited his mouth. He was 22.</p> <p>Melaine had moved to Hawaii to be near Joe's base. She was at home, sleeping in Joe's clothes, she missed him so. She heard the knock. Maybe it was the mailman, maybe another soldier's wife. She opened the door. She closed the door: She had seen them, two people, a chaplain and an officer. She stood behind the closed door.</p> <p>When Joe died, Ray Long and his wife, Elaine, hopped a plane to Hawaii to be near their daughter. Long stood as tall as he's ever stood. That doesn't mean he didn't twist inside, didn't come home and stare out into the great yonder in silence.</p> <p>""I went deer hunting last fall,"" Long is saying. ""The last night out we stayed at a cabin overlooking a lake. The sun was setting. I was sitting on the front porch. I had got a deer. Had my feet up. Smoking a cigar. Had me a Diet Coke. I saw a big flock of geese coming in, landing. I began thinking about Joe. It would have been something if I could have shared that with him.""</p> <p>""My husband loves his three daughters up and beyond,"" says Elaine. ""He finally had a son in Joe. And lost him.""</p> <p>Long knew someone in the athletic department at Derby High, and he thought maybe a funeral could be held there. Before he could finish asking, he was interrupted. Of course, was the answer.</p> <p>The night before the funeral -- which was held Aug. 6, 2004 -- Loren Flaharty, Joe's old teammate, who went on to play for Southern Illinois and now works at the Derby rec center, sat down to write a tribute to Joe. He expected the words to gush out. But Flaharty's hands wouldn't move. Everything he wanted to say about Joe was in his eyes, in his chest, in his silence, in his memory. Then Flaharty thought of Adam White, a friend of his and Joe's -- ""Adam White got a 31 on the ACT!"" -- and he asked White to write the tribute.</p> <p>""Joe was your best friend,"" Flaharty began, reading Adam's words and giving his own heart to the memories inside that stadium, ""if you knew him for 20 minutes -- or 20 years.""</p> <p>It was Joe Herndon's last run inside Panther Stadium. More than 1,500 showed.</p> <p>Melaine Herndon moved into a new house in Derby last month. It sits back on a piece of just-cleared land with wheat fields in the distance. It's roomy and nice. The first week or so were hard, introducing herself to the neighbors, explaining Joe. Joe would have moved boxes, furniture, checked the pipes, fluffed the pillows. Run back to the store when they forgot something. She'll lay her head down and dream of Joe. ""I had a dream that Joe called and I said, 'Why haven't you called me?' And he said, 'I've been busy.' And I said, 'Oh, okay.' And we each said, 'I love you.' ""</p> <p>""I was never supposed to buy a house without him,"" she says, sitting near some unpacked boxes. ""We were supposed to buy the house together.""</p>"

"event","I was talking with the janitor at one of the schools I work for and
he was telling me that the mountain in our back yard, Mt. St. Helens
has changed the way scientist think about how old the rock we live
on is.&nbsp; He's a friendly guy and believes in the new earth type of thing
and said that this volcano had formed a canyon that, like the grand
canyon, looks to be really old but we all know it was made in a day, and
henceforth, scientist have got the age of earth wrong.

He and I are both alive today because of science since were both
diabetics but he apparently believes that some of them scientist aint
to smart.&nbsp; I don't know about that but I do know that he is using
information he gets off the net from some of the newly formed
Intelligent Design sites.&nbsp; These sites authors use information gained from
scientist to promote their theories but it doesn't look like too many
of them do any science studies themselves.&nbsp; In fact there seems
to be quite a few of them with ""Dr."" before there name.

My uncle use to say ""What do you call a doctor who finishes
last in his class?""&nbsp; ...the answer is a Doctor.&nbsp; Calling yourself a Doctor
seems to give you credibility which I don't have a problem with but
what I found out is that there are schools...online schools...online
spirtual type of schools that hand out these ""Dr."" certificates to
folks without too much effort on the students part.&nbsp; That has got
to be really cool for those students since a DR in front of your
name has to help you score with the ladies a little easier. :)

This is a good article on why some steroids are bad and others are quite good.&nbsp; The trick to 
making a good steroid is that its got to make your muscles smaller or keep you from having
baby's.

I also learned if I can find just the right ratio of dog and guinea pig testicle extract and inject
it in me, that I may become one of the true badasses of all badasses and I will then announce
it here on my blog for all of science to learn from. :)

""<b>MY 5 SIMPLE RULES FOR MORE BALANCED EATING</b>""

1. <b>Have a eating cut-off time.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finish meals and snacks two to three hours before bedtime.

<i>-dude...what is it...2 or 3 hours?&nbsp; I'm fricken hungry!</i>

2. <b>Eat a nourishing breakfast.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McDonald's has wonderful choices that can be part of any
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; balanced lifestyle, like a Fruit 'n Yogurt Parfait, an Egg
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McMuffin sandwich without cheese and plain Hotcakes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with syrup.

<i>-dude...if you add syrup,them aint too plain now are they?</i>

3. <b>Drink a minimum of six 8-ounce glasses of water everyday.

</b><i> -dude...last time I checked with a nutritionist, it was closer to 100 ounces of H20 daily
&nbsp;and thats double if your drinking it in cafennated drinks but I'm getting nick-picky now.

</i>4. <b>Eliminate alcohol.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relax with herbal tea and celebrate family events with all-ages sparkling cider.

<i> -dude...how's quitting boozing a simple rule...two words...Fuck You!

</i>5. <b>Make eating a conscious act.</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adopt a family rule of no sitting in front of the TV. Sit down to family meals.&nbsp; It's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a great way to reconnect.

<i> -ok..for those who hate ""dude"" this is my last one.&nbsp; dude...this aint the 50's no mo.
&nbsp;we bee's multitasking and shit.&nbsp; TV, computer, pager, ipods and BBQ chicken at the
&nbsp;same time and it aint no thang but a chicken wing...:)

<dd><font size=""+2""><b>Reichstag fire</b></font>, burning of the Reichstag  (parliament) building in Berlin, on the night of Feb. 27, 1933, a key event in  the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship and widely believed to have been  contrived by the newly formed Nazi government itself to turn public opinion  against its opponents and to assume emergency powers. Hitler had secured the  chancellorship after the elections of November 1932, but his Nazi Party had not  won an overall majority. He therefore obtained Cabinet consent to fix new  elections for March 5, 1933. Meanwhile, his propaganda minister, Joseph  Goebbels, is supposed to have devised the scheme whereby 10 agents led by Karl  Ernst were to gain access to the Reichstag through a tunnel leading from the  official residence of Hermann Goring, Reichstag president and Hitler's chief  minister, who was then to conduct an official investigation, which would fix  responsibility for the fire on the Communists. The supposed arsonist was a  Dutchman, Marinus van der Lubbe, whom some have claimed was brought to the scene  of the crime by Nazi agents. Others have contended that there was no proof of  Nazi complicity in the crime, but that Hitler merely capitalized on van der  Lubbe's independent act. The fire is the subject of continued debate and  research. <p></p> <p></p> </dd><dd>On Feb. 28, 1933, the day after the fire, Hitler's dictatorship began with  the enactment of a decree ""for the Protection of the People and the State,""  which dispensed with all constitutional protection of political, personal, and  property rights. Though the ensuing elections still did not give the Nazis an  outright majority, they were able to persuade the Reichstag to pass an Enabling  Act (March 23) whereby all its legislative powers were transferred to the Reich  Cabinet by a vote of 444 to 94, so sanctioning the dictatorship. A feature of  the ensuing arson trial, at which van der Lubbe was convicted, was the acquittal  of the Bulgarian Communist Georgi Dimitrov after a strong defense.</dd>

Top Athletes May Be Running Into a Tall Hurdle: Themselves
By DAVID LEONHARDT
 
Human prowess is not supposed to have a reverse gear. Computer chips shrink and become more powerful. Skyscrapers grow taller, and spaceships travel farther. Medicine keeps people alive longer.

But for almost a decade, the Summer Olympics have offered a mysterious exception. In some of the most basic ways imaginable - how fast people can run, how high they can jump, how far they can throw - the march of progress has stopped. The track and field athletes competing in Athens Olympic Stadium over the next week and a half may well struggle to match the performances of their predecessors.

Four years ago, no relay team was able to cover 400 meters as quickly as four United States runners had in 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. Carl Lewis jumped farther in Seoul than any man would 12 years later in Sydney, Australia, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee did the same among women.

In more than two-thirds of track and field events, in fact, the gold-medal performances in 1988 would have been good enough to win again in 2000. Just one result from 1976, by contrast, would have won in 1988, among the 32 events in which comparisons are possible, said Raymond Stefani, a professor of electrical engineering at California State University at Long Beach who studies the Olympics.

In more than a century of Olympic history, only world wars, by killing millions of people in their athletic prime, had previously caused this kind of stagnation. 

So its return has inevitably raised the question of whether human beings are finally approaching the limits of physical accomplishment, after decades of unfulfilled predictions about such limits. Many athletes and coaches, and some scientists too, say the answer is probably yes.

To others, however, a less natural explanation is more likely. At least some of the record performances from the 1970's and 80's owe themselves to the miracle of drugs. Only now, after a decade of more effective drug testing, do athletes seem to be catching up to the steroid-aided results of the past, many Olympics watchers say.

The Athens Games have the potential to clear up some of the mystery. More stagnation will suggest that athletics might well have entered an era of only minuscule improvements. 

""Athletes are reaching their potential,"" said Mark Elliott, an assistant track coach at Louisiana State University, which has highly ranked men's and women's teams. ""You won't see much faster times anymore. If there's any going beyond the records, it's just going to be very, very small.""

A return to progress, on the other hand, could mean that the limits remain somewhere off in the future.

""We're moving back to normality,"" Professor Stefani argued. ""There's nothing I see that says we're hitting a plateau.""

Nearly every day over these Summer Games will offer a new data point. Men and women will put the shot tomorrow at the Ancient Olympia Stadium, the site of the original games almost 3,000 years ago. In 2000, the men's shot-put winner launched it 21.29 meters, and 20.56 meters won for the women. Neither result would have been good enough to win in 1988. The argument that the limits to performance are within sight has obvious appeal. Somewhere, the limits exist - nobody seems to think that a one-minute mile is possible - and athletes will eventually approach them.

Beside the stagnation of Olympic results, the recent progress of women in sports and a dearth of breakthroughs with new equipment offer reasons to wonder if the time is now.

For decades, female athletes were closing the gap between their performances and those of males. Women had long been denied the athletic scholarships, endorsements and training resources that men had received, and as the playing field began to be leveled, women made rapid improvements.

In 1970, the women's world record in the 400-meter dash was 18 percent slower than the men's. It is 10 percent slower today.

But many researchers say the remaining gaps could exist forever in most sports. Men have a higher concentration of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, allowing them to breathe more efficiently than women can. Men also have less body fat on average, and thus more muscle per pound of weight, than women do.

""Most of the difference today is really due to biological differences,"" said Phillip B. Sparling, a professor of applied physiology at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He estimates that men's performances will remain roughly 8 to 11 percent better in most events.

The gaps between the men's and women's record have actually increased somewhat in recent years in the races at 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,500 meters. The difference in the marathon has shrunk, although it is still slightly more than eight percentage points.

Athletic gear seems to have followed a similar path to female athletes over the last decade. Fiberglass poles that make vaulting easier, synthetic tracks that mitigate the effects of bad weather, and deeper pools and lane lines that calm waves have all existed for years. Perhaps the most heralded recent invention, the full-body swimsuit, ended up having almost little if any effect on times, many say.

""We've reached a peak from a technological standpoint,"" said Rowdy Gaines, a gold medalist in 1984, who is now a commentator for NBC Sports. ""I do believe swimming is reaching a plateau. I don't think it's going to happen in the next four to six years. But I think it's going to happen in my lifetime.""

Unlike runners, swimmers and weightlifters have continued to improve in recent Olympics, but not at nearly the rate they once did. Swimming times fell less between the 1988 and 2000 Summer Games than they did during a typical four-year span in the 1960's and 70's.

But if athletes are now beating times from the 80's that were drug-aided, as many people suspect, any kind of gain starts to look impressive. The new swimming world records set in the first few days of the Olympics, including one by Michael Phelps in the 400-meter individual medley, seem to support the idea that athletes have not yet reached the limits of performance.

The idea that no future generation will devise ways to top this one is as misplaced now as it has always been, say those who believe the stagnation has more to do with drugs than anything else.

""When I was competing in the early 60's, we thought our times were pretty close to the human limit,"" said Phillip Whitten, the editor in chief of SwimInfo, a magazine that covers the sport. ""And now they're pretty good times for 13- and 14-year-old girls."" 

Track and field results may have slid backward because the doping was widespread for longer in the sport for longer than it was in swimming. Many top runners have recently been investigated for suspected drug use, including Tim Montgomery, who holds the world record in the 100-meter dash.

""We're not comparing clean to clean"" in track, Professor Stefani said. If drug testing is able to stay a step ahead of drug use - no sure thing - he predicted that progress could return to its old trajectory: roughly 80 years from now, the record time at 800 meters, for example, would simply be double today's record at 400 meters. 

The Olympics are also not the only venue for studying times, of course. In some events in which gold-medal times have increased since 1988, like the men's 200-meter dash, the world record has since been broken, at another event. 

But records are not falling as they once were, suggesting that the current period is not normal. To most experts, the odds have risen that human beings have entered an era of only small improvements.

""At some point, we have to reach that,"" said Dave Johnson, director of the Penn Relays. ""That's the way I see it. But the wonderful thing about sports is that you're always surprised.""

"event","I was surfing the net today looking for the superstar in Hotdog eating, Sonya ""The Black Widow"" Thomas and came across this site:  http://www.kidzworld.com/site/p371.htm  SO I will have two things to comment on today.

I recall hearing this said in the playgrounds in gradeschool a lot but never stopped and thought about how sexist it was till today while on this site.  I'm a guy so realizing things take time, I'm talking decades..:-)  The author reasoning is spot on and very clear and simply stated.  Kudo's to the author.

Back to my original search.  I was watching on ESPN this hotdog contest and it was pretty gross to view but I was amazed not by the world record holder ""Takeru Kobayashi"" but by the person to his right Sonya Thomas.  Sonya weighed in at 98 pounds or 44.5 kg's.  She started out slow and was behind 6 people for the first 8 minutes of the 12 minute contest and managed to push ahead of 3 people in the last 4 minutes to take third and set the womens world record with a total of 32 dogs consumed.  I think this picture belows says it all.

Sonya and Takeru are sandwich between two american dudes with a combined weight close to 1000 pounds.  She now has another fan in this world...ME.  Sonya has a website which is found here:

Well I just have to shake my head...again....and again.  My sport, Track and Field, has so many black eyes, well whats another one going to hurt.  Come on guys, give up already, the horse got out of the barn 40 or so years ago...your not going to get it back in alive, so your just going to shoot it out in the field.

The trials are starting today and looks like drug use will be the focal point...again.  I have a freind who's competing in the Hammer and I hope he does well.  He's been training now for about 17 years or so and he's got a shot at making into the finals...go Scott!! ;)

I probably won't get a chance to see him on TV since NBC usually covers one throw from the top hammer guy but I am hoping he will have some tape for me to watch when he gets back."

After school Chelsea Marcus and I went to MV to watch Timmy wrestle. And Chelsie introduced me to this deamy guy named kyle ohh talk about a teenage wet dream! hahaha. We saw Alyssa and Sarah and Angelina there and we hung out with them durring the varsity mattch. The guys looked so funny moving around on the matt in their little spandex.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah me and Chelsea were walking back from Jack n the box and we were behind these two guys and they were walking like gangsters... and me and Chelsea started to walk like them and it was so funny and then i told her we should stop, because if that guy would have turned around i think he would have shoot us.

"event","Today was good and bad all at once... it was good because i had fun at school. I feel like a nerd for saying that but when i'm at school im happy because im with friends and i don't have all the crap that i get at home. When i got home everything was fine then i had to go see my dad and he yelled at me for the GAYEST resason ever! He yelled at me because i was cold and he blamed it on me wearing sandles and said i wasnt dressed appropriatly when i was weraring pants and a sweatshirt! UHHGGG! But he bought me make up so that kind of made up for it. Then i got home and i asked my mom if i could use her digital camra and she got all weird about it like i was going to break it... and then my step dad yells at me so i can't do anything right! i fucking hate tonight. The only good this about today was lunch because i didn't care about anything i was happy and i didn't get bitched at. Well im going to go. I hope he knows how i feel...

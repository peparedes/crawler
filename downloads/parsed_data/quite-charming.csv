"event","Hey guys! I finally figured out how to use this thing, with a little help from Anna. I just got back from her house and it was very .....interesting   to say the least. Yet another hurricane came and went while I was there, only this time we weren't picking up a bunch of branches and shingles...maybe next time. We did, however, listen to music,play a somewhat hilarious game of cherades, and manage to transfer pizza threw the hurricane from my aunt's house to my grandma's house. Now that I am home I'm finishing my homework ( I have already cleaned my room though) and watching t.v. I'll write in here probably tomorrow so stay tuned!"

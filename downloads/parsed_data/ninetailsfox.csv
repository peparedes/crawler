"event","Yo katie, Ahlee. Do u guys know Courtney Otton...well...she's the bitch.
This is why i think so..
it all started 11-9-04 at 6th peroid in chemestry. the teacher asked us to grade someone's paper, but we can't llok at the name.  at the same time she asks me to pass out the worksheet for homework. as i was passing out the sheet, my friend mawish asked me to go around and softly ask who has her paper.  i do so.  when i comeup to courtney and ask her is she has mawish's paper, she says""EWW!, Don't talk to me, gross"" like a white girl. why she said it i dont know. so i said she dont gotta bitch about it.  well then i ask my self waht is there to bitch about in the first place. so i say u need an ass whopping biatch, and then finish my task. i also sit back in my seat and then annoy her. for fun.  at the end of class in the hallway, i yell out COURNEY IS A BITCH ASS MOTHER FUCKING SKINNY ASS HOE. i know she heard me, but she ignores me. so remember kiddies, the moral of the story is that courtney is a bitch!!

-ps
    i do drugs!"

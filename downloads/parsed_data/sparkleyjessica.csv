...ok, maybe the heat is getting to me! lol!
I'm ready for winter. :D

On a side note, I actually HAVE been getting some things done, am pretty much on top of schoolwork (although I've been lazy this week) and mopped the kitchen yesterday! The kitchen was entirely clean!! :D ANd the front room too!! Now I'm going to tackle the bathrooms today and try to finnish up laundry! It's almost all caught up also! Yipee!!
This staying home cuz your too broke to go places seems to really pay off in the housework department! lol!"

"event","So Christian loved his cooking class yesterday. It seems like it's Monday again, which is wierd. I can't believe that it's Tuesday. 
Last night there was a board meeting and then afterward I was standing around talking to everyone and then Whitney came over and we drank a little. 
Today has been LAZY! I need to do schoolwork and the house but I'm lazy. i read a Nicholas Sparks book called ""The Best of Me"", which was really good but obviously predictible. But it was a nice fluff book and made me tear up at the end. Damn you Nicholas Sparks for making me feel emotion!!! lol!
I've gotta do something today that amounts to something. Blah!! :D
Christian has game 1 in the tournament. i have to drive nearly an hour to get to the ball diamond where the tournament is held and i'm not really looking forward to that. 
ps--sorry for all the non capitolizations (sp?) my stupid shift button keeps sticking."

I have my computer fixed and am back online at home now!! :D The only problem is that my mouse is acting up now and I had to borrow my mom's! crazy huh? Luke says that he has one that he used to use with his laptop but doesn't use anymore that I can have. I swear, I have run into a million problems last week trying to get my computer up and running so that i can go to school. Somehow I made it last week and got everything turned in on time. Hopefully this week will be the same level of success. I just keep running into every problem imaginable. Grr!!

So this morning I'm taking Christian to Session 1 of a 2 week free cooking class in town. He's really excited! :) I guess while he's cooking, i'll take the boys to the park and we can just play. i could use the time to study or I could write letters...or just enjoy the day. I dunno...but i like the freedom of an hour of just sitting outside. :D

On a side note, i have noticed that we are blowing through our food budget! I really can't believe how much the boys eat now! Even Kayden, who used to barely eat anything! It's insane at how much i have to spend on food now! Even trying to eat cheap! I did go to Save a Lot and bought $250 worth of groceries, so the pantries are full. i just have to buy little things like meat or things that I want to make me fat like pop or ice cream. lol! I'm thinking that i need to get a sam's club card soon and start buying in bulk. it will prob. save me $$$!"

This is what happened to me today: Went with my friend/co-worker/boss's fiance Whitney to town and as we are driving up hospital hill, we see this guy walking on the sidewalk. When he sees us, he raises his fist in like a ""Power to the People"" sort of way. Without looking at each other or a word in-between us, we both raise our fists back at him like saying ""I support you brother"". This is small-town rural Midwest. We don't do much random crazy. It's just more like stupid people not understanding how things work crazy. After the fist raising incident, I look at Whitney (who was driving) and say ""I just did it back to him, did you?"". Which she did, because she's equally awesome.

"event","My dark cloud has lifted and I'm feeling better. I'm not so low anymore. I'm not sure why but whatever! I'm just glad that I feel better. For one, I feel like I am actually making headway in life again. 

Reasons why I think things are going better for me:

1. Evan hasn't been making anymore gigantic messes here lately,
2. I'm working less so even though that means that I won't be making barely any money I am home more.
3. The boys have started school and I am able to conquer the mess while they are away.
4. Even though my house is still not 100% spotless, I am at least making headway on a daily basis!
5. Luke has helped me with the house. 
6. My family is helping me with money and bills. 
7. My family and Luke's family helped me with some of the back to school clothes expenses. 
8. My ex is bothering me less. 

So needless to say, I'm feeling much much better!!!!!!!


The boys did start back to school the 17th and so far they are loving it! :) Their old elementary building got shut down and this year all 13 grades are in the same building. It's an adjustment, that's for sure! The old elementary was wonderful but it was a very old building and it has foundation problems as well as a mold problem and it cost too much to try and maintain the elementary building and the jr high/HS building, so the school combined the two buildings. Not to mention that the class size has dropped quite a bit, especially in the HS. :( The classrooms are smaller than the old elementary but if we want to keep our school, this is what we are going to have to deal with. 

Christian is in the 4th grade, Logan is in the 2nd grade and Kayden is in the 1st grade. Because it is such a small school some of the classes are combined and are in one room and have one teacher. 1st and 2nd are together, 3rd and 4th are together and 5th and 6th are together. Both Logan and Christian have the same teacher as they did last year, which they are happy about as both really like their teacher. :) The interesting thing is that this year (and every other year) Logan and Kayden are in the same class. I'm very curious as to how that will work out! Logan tends to be bossy to Kayden and he also sometimes teases Kayden to get him flustered. For example: Logan has been known to go out of his way to walk right by Kayden and then ""accidently"" bump into him. *eye roll* BUT in school Logan is on his best behaviour and all the teachers love him! So we'll see what happens! I hope that he treats Kayden better and they get to be better friends. 


I got my schedule from work for next week and I just work 2 days. One 6 hour day and one 8 1/2 hour day. Ha! They are really trying to get rid of me or there really aren't any hours. Regardless, I have to look at the positive and think that even though I'm not going to be making that much money it opens up a lot of days to subsititute as well as all the time I'm going to get to spend with Evan AND be home for the boys! :)

OH yeah, forgot to mention that I got my first subbing job of the school year!!! I'll be subbing Tues! Which is the 2nd day of school for that school district!! I am SO stoked!!!! :D"

Went swimming yesterday with a friend of mine and her kids---Logan and her son are bffs. It was so hot, so the water felt amazing!!! :) I'm pretty sure I got a little toasty from the sun but my legs are still white!! lol!

At the pool I taught Evan to swim underwater...or really he taught himself. He wanted to go underwater and I told him to hold his breath and then all of a sudden, he was swimming underwater in the baby pool!!! Crazy kid! He can do it too!!!

I felt a little bummed yesterday, I don't know. It seems that no matter what I do, it's just futile. Ugh! No matter how much I clean, the house still seems messy. No matter what, I never have enough time or energy to do everything that needs to get done. blah blah blah"

You can go outside without the fear of your shoes melting to the pavement. lol! But earlier, before I went to work, my air was on full-blast but it was still 90 degrees in here!

I have the next 4 days off and it's going to be GLORIOUS!!!!! :D I plan on doing some catchup housework and general lazy stuff. I have some books to read, some tv/movies to watch and quite a few letters to write.

I haven't gotten much done, mainly because while I'm in one room, Evan uterly another room. It's highly frustrating. I just kicked everyone outside so I can get some work done. You would think that I told each of them that they had to pick a finger to lose. *eye roll* I'm thinking about strolling down to the mailbox and see if I got anything exciting. 

I'm making progress on the trunk---I don't know if I mentioned it or not but I found this old trunk @ a thrift store for crazy cheap and I've cleaned it up and working on lining it (I'm just going to line it with pretty wrapping paper from Dollar General--lets see if it works!) and then I'm going to use it to store blankets and throws!! I really haven't had a place for them and they usually wind up just laying around in various places, taking up space and generally catching dust. 

Can you believe that I STILL haven't gone swimming yet this summer?! Poor me! It just hasn't worked out plus I've just been working too much. I'm going to go swimming if I have to take the pool hostage!!!! lol

First I found out that I didn't get the para job that I wanted and THEN at work, I got demoted!!! :( I made a mistake ONCE and got wrote up for it but b/c the district manager was there, I got ""fired"" for it. I still have a job, which I don't want but I don't have enough money in the bank to walk out. This super pisses me off. I really wanted to just leave...but I can't do that and survive the rest of the summer. :(  

There is another para position that I'm going to apply for and if I don't get that, I'm still going to quit Pamida once school begins....prob around September(ugh! If I can last that long)...and just sub full-time. I think that I'll be able to b/c subs are hard to find for most schools. 

Ok, here is what I got wrote up for:

April: I listened to the help desk and they were wrong, so I got wrote up for that. 
June: I rung up a customer wrong. She complained and so I got wrote up for that. I also got wrote up for being late too much. 
July: I accidently made the prices of milk too low. Granted, if we had been caught we would have lost the ability to sell milk...but those prices were only effective for ONE DAY! No one caught us...nothing happened. 
--I would like to also note that ALL of these ""offenses"" were my first time making this mistake. FIRST time! No warnings or anything!!!!!

And about potty training Evan...he now will sit on the potty but holds it until you let him get up...then 5 mins later he pees on the floor. ugh"

So I'll back up to Thurday, St. Patty's Day but it's also Luke's birthday. To celebrate, we went to the ""city"" to do some shopping. I planned on getting a new fridge and dishwasher w/my income tax $$ @ Sears. After an hour and 1/2, I had chosen the ones that I wanted that fit into my price range and went to pay....check declined, debit card declined...I called the bank and Oh yeah, there's a $500 daily limit on all accounts. Wtf?! Grr!!!! I wanted to do some shopping but Evan was with us and he was being a holy terror. Yea for us!

I don't even rememeber Friday so don't ask! I guess I blanked that day out! lol! Oh remember something about working @ Pamida and then my dad bbq-ing or something. Also I stayed up until 3am working on my stupid homework....I hate VennDiagrams. Grr!

Saturday was insane...BUT I didn't have to cook, so that was good! Sat morning (when I finally got up) I made an apple pie (from scratch---well, the crust was Jiffy mix but it's sooooo good!), then went to my Grandma's quilt show with her quilt group, THEN to a dinner party @ our friend's house (Logan has 2 BFF's--Cameron and Tayler and all of the parents get along fantastically! We are going to try to have a monthly dinner party at different people's houses. It should be fun!). Whitney (Tayler's mom) made Reuben sandwiches--delish! And everyone raved on my apple pie! :) I think next month is going to be my turn. The kids all had fun playing together and the adults had a good time talking. :D
After that, we headed to town to the bowling ally where Luke's birthday party was. It was fun! All his imm. family and their families came and we bowled (I sucked butt--only bowled a 64! Yeah, I'm pretty sure Evan bowled better than me). Then went to Pizza Hut and got a bunch of pizzas. It was fun but I was exhausted at the end of the day! 
After the kids went to bed, Luke and I started watching ""Barton Fink"" (he got it from Netflix) but only got 1/2 way through before we both felt like crashing--and he still had to drive home!

Sunday I went to church and it actually wasn't miserable like usual! I went over to my parents house for dinner and my mom made this amazing corned beef with cabbage and homemade choc/butterscotch chip cookies. Yummy! Then it was off to Cub Scouts, which was pretty cool b/c the Sheriff came and talked to them and then fingerprinted each of them, even Kayden! I just wondered to myself if he knew who the boys were b/c of their dad. He's pretty professional though. 
Then after Cub Scouts, it was back to the city to buy that fridge and dishwasher. I got a heck of a deal---30% off my Kenmore stuff, 10% off installation, no tax on the dishwasher, cheap delivery and haul-away. All in all, I saved at least $300! :D I can't wait! The new fridge is much bigger than my dinky-a** one and I've never had a dishwasher before so I don't even know what to do!! I may melt with excitement~!
After Sears, I took the boys to Long John Silvers. It's so bad for you but sooooo yummy!!!!

Then on the way home, Christian had an asthma attack and I didn't have his inhailer with me for some strange reason--I think that I gave it to his basketball coach, so she could take it to all of his games and practises. So we had to make a pitstop @ the nearest ER. We got home around 10-ish and then I stayed up until 1am doing homework. At 1:30am, Christian had another asthma attack and another one @ 6:30am, so I kept him home and called into work. It's just too scary to not be near him when he's having problems. 

Once I got a nap in, I'm doing great. Now can you see why I'm exhausted?"

"event","Yep. Title says it all. Last night comming home from town there was an awful snow storm, I'm saying it was a blizzard b/c you could hardly see where you were going. So I'm trying to come home (in the dark!) and it's slow going and I'm super stressed b/c I couldn't really see where I was going, let alone see where the road was. THEN when I was nearly home, my windshield wiper broke and not just the rubber part but the entire dang thing! Must have been all the ice or something. :) 

So I went from not being able to see that good, to not being able to see at all! I had all the kids with me and what was I going to do? I was too close to home to turn around, I couldn't do much of anything. So I just kept on going. Luckily there was shadows where to ditches were and I knew the road. I couldn't roll down my window b/c it was frozen shut so I opened my car door and leaned out as I creeped along. Sometimes I couldn't see b/c the snow was blowing so hard on my face but I just had to make do. :( It was terrifying esp when I kept seeing various vehicles in ditches. Somehow I made it home, somehow. It was scary! I felt like crying but I couldn't cry b/c I had to keep my wits so that I could get home! 

THIS is why I got caught in town during a snowstorm:

I got a call from the elementary telling me that Logan was having an awful headache and that I needed to come a get him. So I did and he looked awful! I was afraid that he had Influenza B or whatever b/c a lot of people are getting it. The nurse @ the doctor's office said to give him some Tylenol, watch him and then call her in the morning. He felt better with Tylenol BUT once the Tylenol wore off the headache would come back in full swing. Also around 3 pm, he began having a ear ache. We got an appt for the earliest time on Thurs---3:30pm. Yeah. In the meantime, the snow started and the other 2 boys got out early. I think that they got here around 2pm. Anyhoo, so I start for town around 2:30pm amid loads of snow. 

We were at the doctor's office for 1 1/2 hours and the doctor thought that he had Influenza. So we scoot off to the hospital where we wait another hour or so for a nose swab. Once they finally swabbed him, we waited another 30 minutes for the results, which were negative. He has something but they're not sure what. Then I had to go to WalMart b/c they were the only pharmacy open that late to get his prescriptions. Luckily it only took 20 minutes! I figured that we were going to not have school today (which we didn't) so I quickly stocked up on staples. That took maybe 10 minutes. Got gas and finally was able to leave at 7pm. Nearly 4 hours. Ridculous. 

**He is doing better now as long as I keep him shot up with meds. Poor little guy!

In addition:

Tuesday Kayden was sick b/c he had an ear ache in the middle of the night too. I gave him ear drops that the doctor gave us for his tubes and then his ears quit hurting but they were draining a massive amount! So bad that stuff is literally dripping out of his ear! He kept soaking through cotton balls!! The doctor said that he had an ear infection and gave us some meds. The wierd thing is that his ears are STILL draining a bunch. Hmmm.

I can't wait until everyone is well again!!!!"

"event","Snowed again and I'm not sure that I can get out tomorrow either. I'm pretty sure that I've gone crazy from the children! I have been kinda lazy but this is what I have done today:

*Made pancakes from scratch.
*Ate pancakes! Very tasty! :)
*Watched ""The Dark Crystal"" with the boys. It was a fave of mine as a kid and I'm glad that I could introduce it to them!
*Wrote a partial letter.
*Finnished ""Dead to the World"", book 4 in the Sookie Stackhouse series, which I love!
*Played Wii golf with the boys.
*Made grilled cheese sandwiches and veggie soup.
*Ate and it was yummy!
*Stared on a Danielle Steele book called ""A Perfect Stranger"".
*Cleaned the boys' bathroom except for the sink.
*Talked on the phone to my mom, my grandma and Luke.
*Did laundry, folded laundry.
*Watched Spongebob with the boys.
*Played boxing on the Wii.
*Tested my fitness on the Wii. I tested 59. Am ashamed! I will retake this test and I will do better!
*Worked on some of my swaps for Swap-Bot.
*Did more laundry. 
*Did some dishes. Am out of dish soap.
*Made Toll House from scratch c.chip cookies. Forced myself not to eat the entire batch!
*Watched some of Alice in Wonderland with the boys.
*Fixed supper--it was just sandwiches.
*Read 2 chapters of Alice in Wonderland to the boys. It was abridged and they are loving it! Except for Evan but you know! lol
*Fooled around on Facebook, Swap-Bot and LJ. And it's 9pm! 

It looks like I did a lot today but in reality I'm being very lazy! But hey, it's a snow day right? I should totally be doing massive cleaning and getting my house in tip-top shape...maybe tomorrow I'll be motivated. :P

It is COLD! I think that it's going to get down to -20F tonight altho last night it was supposed to be 12degrees colder!! BURRRRRR!!!! My feet are freezing!!"

I'm totally prepared for this blizzard but if the kids don't stop going crazy on the stockpile of food, we might have a Donner party situation on our hands! lol

I had a busy weekend! Friday we went to Sears to get Evan's pics taken which are SUPERCUTE! Here's the link
We went and ate Chinese and everyone was reading their fortunes out loud and he read his too! This is what he said that his said ""Dog (woof!woof!) Dog, dog butt!""--Can you tell he has 3 older brothers?

Then Sat I had to work and the older 2 had basketball games. Later on that evening Luke and I went to the theater and watched ""True Grit"" which was incredible!!!

Sun was church and Cub Scouts. 
I was exhausted at the end of the weekend! I went to work yesterday and today is a snow day!! :D"

The National Music Rack representitive guy was taking a bunch of music off the shelves to return and so I had to help him and fix the numbers in the system (it's part of my job). Anyways I was making small talk and it turned out that he was the Area Manager and was looking for someone to work in that area! It's really not that much work--I would be over 2 stores (one of which is where I work!) and once a month I'll get an email telling me what CD's to take off the shelf. I'll have a month to do this and I'll just take them off the shelf, check through them with the person from the store end and box them up to be shipped via UPS. The end!! I get $10/hour which is pretty good around here and it'll be some extra cash! :D

Guess I'll go back to college. Sigh. I'm not stoked BUT I want/need my degree sooo I have to go back. And actually try this time so I don't flunk out. blah.

(he put a little too much caramel sauce on it but I wasn't about to tell him that! It was still super yummy!) After the kids went to bed, we watched the rest of season 1 of Archer, which was very funny!! :D

Christian and Logan had cub scouts at 4:30. Logan got to wear his brand-spanking new cub scout uniform and he was so proud! :D It was cute! I need to take a picture of him in his uniform for the scrapbook.

This week has been CRAZY!! I will break it down:

WORK

I did training on Mon, Wed, Thurs for the Office and Recieving Specialist job @ Pamida, which I don't even know if I know what I'm doing!! I'm supposed to start tomorrow and I think that I have more questions than understanding. I just hope that I took in enough information to get by without looking like an idiot! Ugh!

Friday I subbed for Spec. Ed for Tyson and that was not bad. I really didn't have to do much teaching and played around on Facebook for awhile. It's never a bad thing to get paid to play on FB! lol

BIRTHDAY STUFF

Thursday was Logan's 7th birthday!! Happy Birthday Logan! On his actual bday I sent homemade strawberry cupcakes to school, then I took him and the rest of the family out to Pizza Hut. The boys used their pizza slips from the Book-It, so they all got a personal pan pizza! Saved some $$ for me!!

Friday was the friends birthday. I rented some lanes at the local bowling alley and apparently this was the party of the year! We had 20 kids show up and 10 parents stayed to hang out!!It was a mad house!! They had to open up 2 lanes and there were kids running all over the place!! I bought some frozen pizzas and the lady made them. I had also bought a cake at HyVee and we had that along with ice cream. The kids should have all been very stuffed and worn out! Unfortunally the bill came to $60, which was about $20 more than I thought that I was going to have to pay but oh well I guess. He had a blast as well as all of his friends! All the adults will be talking about the night too! They all hung around the juke box and played music and danced and laughed! I mingled all around and had a blast! My really good friends James and Marci, Whitney and her fiancee and Alicia were all there and I talked to them off and on. Also Clint and Kellie were there with the kid and I hung out with them some too. Everyone was getting a little crazy!! Ha! James flirted with me some, which was a little strange esp since his wife was right there but maybe she just knew that he was kidding around. Strange though! lol

Saturday was a party for my side of the family. It was at my mom and dad's house and all who came were them and of course Dylan and my grandma. He got some nice presents! I made a cake, strawberry flavor again and had the leftover ice cream from the night before. In all honesty I am birthday'ed out. ugh!

THANKSGIVING: PART 1

Sunday, today, was the first of many Thanksgivings. This was at Luke's mom's house and it was just Lynda, Bob and Mariah, Luke, the boys and I, Crissy, Willie and the kids, Nikki, Adam and the kids. It was a full house but I had a really good time! I really like Luke's family and I think that they really like the kids and I! :) They already pretty much think of Lynda as Grandma Lynda and the kids are like their cousins. I'm really, really glad about that! :)

"event","So Kayden is doing really well after his surgery on Wed. He had his tonsils removed, part of his aidnoids and had tubes put in his ears. He was basically skipping off to surgery b/c he was told that he could have a popsicle after it was all over AND that he could eat ice cream for breakfast. lol

The surgery went great and he is doing wonderful! He only has a little pain and has really taken the ""you can eat all the ice cream and popsicles that you want and you can just play playstation all day!"" to heart and expects just that. It's funny but also a little frustrating. I should have never said that. lol

The first day of school was on Wed as well, so Kayden will miss the first week of school. :( Poor guy! Christian is in 3rd, Logan is in 1st and they were both really excited about going! I told Christian that he needs to start taking a shower in the morning and to make sure that it's every morning and he's really loving that! He's always (at least so far) when I tell him and he hops right in the shower!! He has Zest shower gel and he says that he likes to smell like a man when he goes to school! how cute is that??

Tonight was the Open House and it was neat getting to see their rooms and talk to their teachers. Poor Kayden didn't have really anything to show me cuz he hasn't been there except on orientation or whatever it was. Logan's excited b/c he's with the bigger kids now and Christian is really excited b/c he gets to go upstairs!! The school is 2 story (it's an old building) and so the upper elementary are all upstairs. It was crazy b/c we went there w/my mom and then I left the kids with her so I could go get Luke b/c he wanted to see their rooms and lockers....But my mom and Luke couldn't be there together...My mom wasn't too enthused about watching the boys but I told her basically that it was happening.

I think that Christian won 2nd also in his division. AND get this, little Evan won 2nd in the watermelon eating contest!! The age group was 0-5!! I'm pretty sure he was the youngest there! But get that kid around fruit and he goes crazy!!! lol

I played the egg toss and my partner threw it too hard and I caught it over my head and it BROKE OVER MY HEAD!! Luckily none of it got on me! I would have been done for the day! lol! I also did the watermelon eating contest but didn't place. I think I got 4th or something. It was fun but SO hot!! WHEW!!

I worked Sat, Sun and will work today. Then I don't work for the rest of the week b/c I'll be taking care of Kayden. We go for his physical and pre surgery testing on Tues then BACK to the city (almost 2 hrs away) for the surgery (tonsils & some aidnoids removed and tubes put in his ears)."

There was a heat advisory out today...basically if you go outside you will shrivel up into a little poof of nothingness. lol. I had the air on FULL BLAST and it was still hot and sticky in here. Blah blah, but we lived over it. lol

Cheers to me btw b/c I've been doing a good job of keeping up on the housework, mainly the dishes!! I get tired and then feel lazy and I don't do it...then I have to spend the majority of the day doing backwork! It's stupid! So for the last 3-4 days, I've been keeping up on the living room and the kitchen, which are my biggest problem areas. I'm quickly catching up on the laundry, although after work tomorrow(actually today since I am up so early) I'm going to have to fold and put away some serious laundry. A ton is washed, now just needs put away. :D I'm proud of myself. Now if I can just keep doing this, then hopefully things will get better!! I've also started walking sporatically. Evan likes to be pushed in the stroller down the road and we've done that a few times--it's so much harder to push him and more of a workout than if I just walk by myself!! I can't do it all the time b/c of work and the weather but I think that once school starts and it's my day off, it will just be Evan and I....and my plan is to walk every morning, just the two of us. :D It's beneficial for the both of us!! And honestly, I feel like I have more energy for the rest of the day! I haven't even be needing caffine as much!! So there's some calories that I'm not getting from Mt. Dew or Starbucks mocha iced coffees!!

Yesterday we did the school shopping/tax free thing and although I got some GREAT deals, I wasn't able to finnish it b/c I maxed out my daily limit! GRR! I totally forgot about that and I paid my car insurance that morning before I headed out to the city to shop. I SHOULD have stopped at the bank and took out like $200 but I didn't. I'll learn next time. I still got everyone a cool backpack for under $10, everyone shoes that were BOGO!! :D Christian got a pair of Nikes and a pair of LA Gear all for $39!! I got Kayden and Logan's shoes @ Kmart, although Logan's were on discount and weren't BOGO. The younger ones wanted shoes w/characters on them but Christian decided that since he was able to play elementary basketball this year, he wanted NIKE's SOO badly, so since I had the money, that's what he got. I would like to add at this time that I'm really proud of myself about money too b/c I've been able to save up money for back to school shopping so I can actually get them some decent brands and not have everything come from WalMart. :D I'm doing so much better than last year. And I would like to add that although that a lot of stuff comes from walmart, I think that I do a good job of making smart choices. I don't think that you can tell where I buy clothes for the boys and that they always look very nice and up to date on fashion. 

Have I mentioned that I hate crowds?? It's was insane @ Shoe Carnival! I really had to surpress the urge to start throwing elbows at all the people! I just want to start boxing people out and ramming them until I have at least a bit of breathing room where I am able to move if I so choose. Blah. But I won't complain too much cuz I got some GREAT deals!"

Kayden was in the hospital all last weekend b/c he was poisoned w/something that had traces of asprin in it. We have no idea how he got poisoned or by what. 

Consequently I missed Christian's 8th birthday which was Sunday (July 25th). I made it home around 6pm. :(

"event","Ok, so you all know that I work at a local grocery store for some extra cash...or at least I am doing so at the moment. I really hate it. I mean I REALLY, REALLY hate it. It's stupid. Now they have me working in the deli, which is waaay more suckage that cashier-ing. Anyways, so if you all aren't aware, I'm a grammer/punctuation Nazi and I have this thing where I will correct public signs if they are wrong. Prob a little anal but in all reality I'm saving the author from his/herself...and the public as well. 

Anyway so this chick keeps posting these ATTENTION type notes but they have really BAD grammer...as in a run-on sentence that lasts for an entire paragraph!! So for fun (and b/c I feel compelled to) I took a Sharpie and corrected all the mistakes and actually made the signs readable. So one day there was a note that said: Please STOP correcting our signs!! Which of course I promptly replied, ""I will once you start using correct grammer/punctuation!"" And I added a smilie at the end, so she would know that I was being a smart ass. Then today there was a NEW note that said ""We r not in school. Grow UP!!"". I commented back on the actual note and this is what I wrote ""Don't be hatin'""!!! See, I'm freaking hilarious!!!! ahahahaa!!"

Wonderful. I'm going to try to get Workman's Comp. Let's see how it goes. Life sucks."

I can't stand Twilight and think it's retarded....and the fans are retarded for liking it. Sorry to all you that like it...I'm making an exception for you cuz I love you. :P

All I can say about Twilight is ""vomit, vomit, vomit"". I'll be happy when it's all over and the world can begin to heal itself from the atrocity that Stephanie Myer has created."

"event","Today I am not working....and I'm not going to do much at home either. Although I need to. I will do some stuff but you know what? I'm sick of working all the freaking time!! I had to work at the dumb grocery store on Sun night and then I had Monday off, which was amazing and then yesterday I subbed for Math AND I had a board meeting from 7-9:30pm. BTW, I'm the newest member of the school board! whoop whoop!

Next week, I'm going to tell the manager that I don't want to work at the grocery store at all b/c I've got my census training to go to. I'm going to be working from 8-4 Tues-Fri and that's a lot of work and that would mean that on my 3 days off, I'll be working at the grocery store OR once I get out of the Census training, I go to work at the grocery store?? Nope. I'm just not going to work that week. Oh well. 

AND I'm going to have to miss the boys' soccer games b/c I have to work Sat morning!!! RAGE!"

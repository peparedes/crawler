Well, see, my parents had to take my uncle somewhere cuz hes on crack. Terra came over. We watched The Horse Wisperer. Melissa came over in the middle of it. So we watched it. When that girl was kissin that guy. Terra was like ""SHE IS MARRIED!!"" all i heard after that was ""shes MARRIED!!"" haha, funny to me. so then we fed the horses. 

We came back & talked about school & my uncle & stuff like that. Then i felt like watchin a movie. So we watched Hide & Seek. WHICH IS A FLIPPIN HORROR MOVIE. Well, Terra didn't seem to be to scared @ first. Then we both got into it. hehe. We were tryin to figure out who Charlie was & stuff. We were figurin it out & stuff & well this guy was basically phyco. He was a phycoligist (people who sit down & listen to other peoples problems & try to help them ya know). Well, she was like ""he needs a phycoligist"" i was like ""he IS one"" & she was like ""well, he needs a diff. one cuz he aint workin""

I busted out laughin IN THE MIDDLE OF A HORROR MOVIE!! Then sam came & scared the sh!t outta us. So, we were freaked so we watched With Out A Paddle so we wouldnt be so scared. Then we played around with some cards & they left @ 1:30. FUN FUN.

Well, its late & i just thought i would update about my night.

Weel, not much of an update eh? Well today I went to ride Pongo. Didn't happen. The tack room was locked & Danni didn't have the key. So, I went & lunged him alittle. Then came back. Then I had to help Danni get Spencer(the crazy ass olympic horse) in from his turnout. Well im gonna go. Haley just doesn't know when to quit. Jon is coming back. Drew told me like yesterday. Ugh, I need to add <i>Haley sucks</i> to the above list.

Then dragging yourself & the weight of that bookbag filled w// everything, ALL that long way to the car. Then driving for 5 whole minutes to the bus. Gettin on the stupidest bus in the whole world that has shocks that shake so much, they could make chocalate milk. Driving 30 min. Waiting FOREVER. Then going to class, where, you'll talk, not learn anything, then its off to the next class, where, youll talk & not learn anything, & so on & so on. Until you get to lunch. Where, youll talk & eat. I guess its the best time to socialize, as you dont have to whisper or txt message to talk to people. Its also a fun time to SPIT DR PEPPER ON PEOPLE!! +cough cough+ MALLORY!! lol j/k ... ok back to school ... where after lunch, youll drag yourself to class, && talk some more, then theres PE. Where youll run around in a stupid circle & get accussed of flicking people off. Then, youll go inside & get BACK on the stupidest bus. Go home, work SOME MORE. Then, have fun, that is, if there is time!! 

People suck. School sucks. Dr Pepper sucks. Running sucks. I think just about EVERYTHING sucks. Oh well. Only 180 days of school. 

Well, its off to bed for me. Where ill sleep. Then wake up. Then, have some fun =), atleast ill try. Only 11 days till school starts.

No, child, no <BR><BR>The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd beat. <BR>And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground by Johhny's feet. <BR>And Johhny said, devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again. <BR>I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best that's ever been. <BR>He played.... <BR><BR>Fire on the mountain run, boys, run <BR>The devil's in the house of the risin' sun <BR>Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out dough <BR>Granny, will your dog bite?

"event","ok ... so maybe i did kinda get hurt when i feel off :/ ... my ankle hurts && its kinda swollen so i have some ice on it .... lol i dont care though, it was the best freakin fall i ever had!!!!! YAY!!! hmmm cuz im bored to death i guess ill try && remember all my falls

FALL #1 :::
This fall broke my confidence FOREVER, I quit riding @ the time becuase i got so scared. 
Sugar, Melissa's pony, took off w// me && i started to fall so i jumped off && didnt roll. That time I thought 'OMG if one pony does it, there all gonna do it' so im still kinda weirry about riding new horses.

FALL #2 :::
I think this fall was when I was bareback on Montana && he bucked me off && i landed on my tail bone ... on gravel ... not fun 

FALL #3 :::
Being bucked off yet again by Montana. He got fed up w// the dogs so he decided to buck.

FALL #4 :::
Ummmm I was riding down the drive way, Montana got spooked, galloped off I swung my leg around but my other foot didnt come out haha so I was hanging on the side of him .. kinda fun lol 

FALL #5 :::
Jumped off Heathers horse bud becuase he cantered off w// me w// out a bridle or saddle ... scarey ... landed under a SUGAR GUM TREE!!! OOOWWWEEE!!!!!! PAIN!!!!!

FALL #6 :::
I was riding w// Heather, I asked Montana to canter, he didnt lke it, he bucked, I jumped, landed on the ground pretty hard lol

FALL #7 :::
I WAS A STUPID IDIOT!!
I didnt tighten my girth && I galloped on the trail, @ the final turn, the saddle slipped && fell on top of me ... I think this fall made my hip worse, ugh, not fun now. Now, my hip pops even when i laugh ... its bad .. i hate it ...

FALL #8
TODAY!!!!!!!!!
HAHA yall know the details .. this fall hurt my knees ( i dont have very good knees so the impact made them worse), my back (ooowwweeee it hurts!!!), my wrist, my ankle, && my rib .... it was fun though TEEHEHEHE!!




So yes, riding has caused some aches && pains, && some problems (like making my hip worse, ouch) or making my knees ache everyday. But i still love it!!! 

So i gots me a new layout!!! Lettme know if ya like it!!"

"event","I had an awesome fall today! lol ... it was the best fall ive ever had lol ... 
See, when I ride, I have to basically school on trails, well, theres a turn off my dad made as a short cut to the barn. Me & cowboy were galloping down the main trail, when, @ the last SECOND he decides ""Mom, I dont really think i wanna go ALL the way around this trail, lets just go HERE"" WOW, WHAT A SHOCK! I wasnt expecting him to take that turn! Atleast not that sharp! Well, I tryed to grab mane, but it didn't help AT ALL. I literally FLEW off && slammed into some pine trees. I think i rolled, && it accually didnt hurt @ all. I did hit my head, but it doesnt hurt. I do wish i had a helmet here though, were going to get one from SLT as soon as we can. Im so glad i have a hard head lol. It was accualy fun ow that i think of it. He didnt run away, he just lingured(sp) off, && stopped when the reins got tangled on his leg, so, I got back on && rode home. Now, my rib hurts. I guess i just probably bruised it. But thats happend before when i got shot gunned really hard w// a softball that NEIL punted. WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE SUCH GOOD A PLAYER?!?!

Haley is being such a little bitch!! She like won't leave me alone, && sayin I just want to start a fight. SURE w/e. If anyone wants to start a fight, its her. She has an IQ of ike 35. 

OOO GUESS WHAT!! hehe i found me some cowboy boots that fit!! lol they were free too cuz i found them on the porch .... 

Im SOOOO bored!! Saturdays a race!!! YAY!! Heather cant come :( shes goin to Parkers ... shes gotta meet tha new band director dude guy or whatever lol. 

Well I guess this post is like long enough. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

"event","I finally got my info && my layout up. So ... im hoping this LJ will be mine for awhile. idk, last night I just had the urge to make another one lol.

So . . . . . 
Robert Probus came over today!*! I haven't seen him in FOREVER!*! When he first got here, all we did was sit around && then we went && I rode Montana for like 5 minutes, then we went && rode the fourwheelers. Then I think we got bored so then we went swimmin for like 2 minutes && I made a strawberry daquirri(sp?) && they left :( ... hes so much fun to hang out w// ... hes hilarious && crazzy lol. 

My cousin is suppose to come tommarow!*!*!*! YAY!*!*! Zach is like 9 y/o but he looks like 12 ... hes ok to hang out w// ... when he was little omg I loved to get in a fight w// him, like I remember saying ""im older than you"" just to start a fight w// him. lol, thank God he isn't like that anymore. THEN, I might go to a braves game w// him. But only if they invite me. Even though i REALLY want to go lol. So then there stayin all next week then goin to Jacksonville to see Zachs brother ... I haven't seen Zach in like 1 1/2 so im realllyyy excited. 

Well, I guess thats it fer now!&hearts;

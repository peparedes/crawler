"event","i have been hurt to many times, by to many people that i love. but this one is the worst cause i do know we are just on a break but everytime i see her or think of her or think about this stupid break i cry, like alot. this whole thing just makes me think i should get up and leave. i dont know if its the right decision or the wrong. but if i were i would not know if i would get hurt wherever i go. i probably would cause i guess im just that easy to hurt. i love her more and more every day, and i get more and more depressed when im not with her. i would do anything for her, she is my love, my honey bee, my kelly. no matter what happened between us i didnt care, as long as we stayed together. she did try breaking up with me once before and i wouldnt let her. i dont see any other girl attractive anymore, she is the one and only person i love, she makes me want to live. but now that all might be gone, cause she might be gone,found someone new. or just got plane old bored with me. she told me that i was always a wonderful boyfriend, an amazing friend, and a great person. but it makes me think if i am all those why does she not want to be with me."

"event","life is full of  dating, falling in love, friends, family, and pain. ofcourse there is alot of other stuff but this stuff is what i expecially want to talk about right now. the reason im talking about is because well i havent been in here for a very long time, and its what has been on my mind for a couple of days. so im just gonna go off starting in 3..........2............1.........


just in high school i have dated my fair share of people i have loved some of them and i treated most of them horribly. to all those people that i treated horribly i am sorry, if i could go back i would change it. then there were some that treated me like shit too. but its ok because of my dating history it has given me the knowledge of not being a horrible bf, but i do have to say this it has been really hard to find someone who loves me for who i am, not for who they want me to become. 

my friends mean the world to me, they are the reason im still here. i would be lost if i didnt have them, expecially john. john is my best friend, he is my brother, i would take a bullet for him.i expecially have to thank adriana for showing me the most wonderful person ever(mandi). but i have alot of great friends, they have helped me through thick and thin.

well my family is just really a bunch of fucked up people whho like to drink. i cant really think of much to say about them though.

everyone gets hurt in there life, from love to actually hruting them selves. everyone will eventually get over that pain, or make it seem that way. if you get hurt from love yes it will hurt for a while, and it will always hurt inside.but thats life and there really isnt much you can do about that.

this is to everyone in the world if you cnat accept me for who i am then there is no place for you in my life.

i want everyone to remeber this.....relationships make the world go around, love just makes it a safer place."

"event","Love is like 30 Knives,
Driving into your heart.
Sacrificing everything,
To be with her.
Seconds, minutes, hours,
Buying everything she wants.
Soon all you have is petty cash.
See her flirting with someone else.
Then you feel love sick, Heartbroken.
No reason to live,
Want to be murdered, be slaughtered,
maybe beheaded.
No point to love ever again.

"event","so i know that i havent posted in a long while, and really thats because i pretty much forgot all about this stuff. so what has happened since i last posted, welll me and jess broke up which still kills me yes, and just to through it out there i still kind a love her. but its ok cause i am dating  hanna who is amazing in her own little way. i have been through alot since the last year. i have lost alot of people in my life that i cared about. i almost lost my daughter, my friends, and myself. i was thinking about leaving for good also. kinda off subject but really there is no subject just whatever comes to mind. anyways last year while i was dating jess i had someone start a rumor that i killed myself. it was an experiment to find out if jess realy cared for me, and the conclusion was no. it was actually pretty funny cause zach was the only person to try to get ahold of me, and jerry was the only person that figured out that the person who i had start the rumor was lieing cause he had sympathy. i actually got woken up by two police officers that morning, not the most pleasent thing when your on probation, and when your naked. but a couple weeks later me and jess broke up. the day that happened i went home and smoked a carton and a half of ciggerettes. i aslo hung out with mark and david soon after, which made me realize that the only reason i still hang aroung in this shit hole of a town is because of my friends.


this school year, has been a crazy ass mother fucking year with all the shit with friends, ex girlfriends (jess), family and school. ive gotten stronger and alot more quit persay while im in the classroom.

A herd of buffalo can only move as<br /> fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest<br /> and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection<br /> is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of<br /> the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest<br /> members.<br /> In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the<br /> slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain<br /> cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.<br /> In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain<br /> cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That's why you<br /> always feel smarter after a few beers.""</font>"

that if made from the heart will outlast anything...

- Raul and Samantha Juarez -

ove is more than a feeling;
it's a state of mind.

Love is like a blazing flame,
golden and full of warmth.

- Ben Oliver -

What's love?

Love is...
What makes a weak man brave
And a king step off his throne
Good times, bad times
Easy times, tough times
It comes in an instant
And lasts three days after forever
That's what love is.

Love is like a piece of art work,
even the smallest bit can be so beautiful.

Love is sweet, delicate, dreamy
an eternity of gorgeous moments.

Romance is the fuel that keeps love burning hot.

is to realize that it might be lost.

Love,
The key that unlocks the bars of impossibility.

Love is when you look into someone's eyes
and see their heart.

Love is something you can't describe
like the look of a rose,
the smell of the rain,
or the feeling of forever.

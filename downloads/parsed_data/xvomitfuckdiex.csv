"event","I was watching will and grace yesterday, it was a very hard episode for me to watch, i know it's only televivion, but it made me cry. It's the episode where grace gets married and will feels left out, and like he is losing her...so sad, for anyone who has aever had a bff, and like feeels like thgye lost them. will and grace use to remind me of the relationship, me and my bff had, and lately it sort of started falling apart....he started sliping away from me and what not. it has been hard. it was my worst nightmare, maybe im overexagerating, but he means the world to me,and losing him, would be like losing myself, i love him so much. he's been my number one suporter, even tho he can be a bit of a prick and a jerk at times, he's still the best friend ive ever had, and i don't want any others....but it seems to me like he doesn't feel the same. by the way this is called free writing therefore my grammar and what not might not be at its best so don't complain. ne-who, will and grace started singing that song by human league-""don't you want me baby"", and i broke down crying because me and my bff sing that song all the time, and it just reminded me of the time we said we would always be there for eachother, and that we were going to grow old together, and like through think and thin, and all that, and now i just feel lonely. i don't like chnages like these, i feel so unwanted. :[ and i think im about to go vomit, i had dinner, uhg!, but atleast im back to writting."

"event","so, i have never made my eating disorder public, or haven't ever really had the chance to tell ne-one about it, or talk to anyone about it, and im hoping i can meet some ppl interested in talking about it and what not, so i am hoping that i will finally be able to vent, and help myself get to a weight i will be happy with, i want to lose as much as possible, i have such low self esteem, but most don't see it, and im just sick and tired of pretending, and trying to be happy whn i know im not, so hopefully this damn live journal shit will serve as a coping mechanism, and i will meet all those who have an eating dosorder and wish to talk about it, i don't give a rats ass about what other ppl think of me not eating, it gives me a joy nothing else does, and so i want to continue with it. It beats cutting, and hurts alot less, or does it O_o? well either way, i am determined to be as disciplined about my eating disorder as i once was...im excited, but i now this feeling will only last a while. :] and so the journey begins......wish me luck."

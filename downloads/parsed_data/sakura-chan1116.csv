Instead, I am horribly disfigured. Well, not really, but my shoulder hurts like a mother, and I don't exactly have full mobility of the right arm because of it. 

This, however, shall not deter me from riding waves in the future. As far as I'm concerned, there's no other reason to go to the beach. It just shouldn't be done on a beach where the waves are breaking way too close to shore. Fenwick Island State Park is not a great beach. 

In other news, my visa, passport, bill and plane tickets arrived, and I have learned through e-mail that I did in fact get the Konan Scholarship, though I haven't received the actual information regarding it yet. 

Also, the Emmy voters couln't vote their way out of a room made of open doors. Barry Manilow? BARRY MANILOW? Someone better get put on notice for that mistake. 

I'm also disappointed by AD's loss, but I guess with FOX's stranglehold, it was a little hard for them to perform to the best of their ability this past season. The Office was definitely the best choice after them, and they could use the win.

I'm trying to figure out where I'll be living, but so far I only have a general area on the map (Japanese addresses confuse me and they don't seem to work on the Google Earth thing). It's in Ashiyashi, which is outside of Kobe, I guess. 

I'm going to be staying with the Shimizu family, which includes Yukihiro (50), Satomi (43) and their 18-year-old son, Yuma. They also have two dogs who are very cute. I really don't know anything else about them except a couple of interests and the fact that the parents both smoke. I'm going to e-mail them soon, I think. I'm still really nervous about the homestay thing in general, but I guess I just need to get over it. 

Despite my nervous feelings, however, I'm dying for this summer to be over. It's going to be so nice not working for a whole school year (or, if I do work some, like tutoring or something, it's not going to be the majority of my non-class time).

Then, hopefully, I'll be painting some other picture for this woman's doctor. Of course, I kind of doubt she'll get the necessary pictures or whatever to me in time.

Kenny posed some questions, but I shall answer them later. 

There's really not a whole lot new going on. Just felt like updating.

I've figured out that if I study like 31 kanji a day from Remembering the Kanji Vol. 1, I will get through all of the writings/meanings of the 2043 or so kanji featured in the book, and will be able to start studying the readings. Those books are really effective, but it does put someone at a slight disadvantage when it comes to testing one's progress in kanji, since it approaches it differently. I don't want to be put in a lower level class because I'm completely retarded when it comes to the kanji readings. Unfortunately, my study plan is proving to be a bit ambitious. 

I have a new commission from the Edward Scissorhands lady, and it's actually another Johnny Depp character, but this time, it's good old Captain Jack Sparrow. She might have me do another painting as well before I leave.

I'm getting promoted to a front end supervisor at Michael's. This means more money and more hours. Also, this will be more responsibility than I've ever had in any previous jobs. I've never really been at a job long enough to get promoted, and I lucked out at Michael's because they needed another FES so badly that they were willing to train me as one even though I'm leaving in September. 

I went to the art museum today. They have an entire Japanese tea house in the Asian Art section. It was pretty awesome. Unfortunately we couldn't go in it, but we could pretty close. We only saw the Asian art section and earlier European art, including armor and weapons, but it was all really neat. I'd like to go back though to see more contemporary works. 

Speaking of art, it sounds like something could be arranged for me to study Japanese art or do something art-related while I'm in Japan. I'm not really sure what options would be available, but I'd love to learn how to do sumi-e. It's so pretty :D

Finally, I must make a TV show plug, for yet another good comedy has been discovered. Watch ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" on FX, everyone! The new episodes air each Thursday, initially, I believe, but you can pretty much find it on several nights a week, as well. (Check your local listings ;) )"

Like everyone, we've been having a lot of rain here. It took my dad three hours to get to work today due to flooding and the accidents and detours it causes. Luckily my house is fine.

But before it started raining here, it was raining quite a bit, from what I understand, in Toledo. In fact, I think they got 7 inches in like 2 minutes at some point (that's what I heard anyway). Needless to say, there was quite a bit of flooding. This really wouldn't mean anything for me, except for the fact that the flooding occurred the same week my parents decided to go to our old house to get the rest of our stuff. Because of this, my dad now has to go back to Toledo this weekend to pick up the car that stalled in deep water and now won't start that will hopefully be fixed when he gets there. I guess it was Toledo's final Fuck You.

Of course, that really isn't the only reason he's going back this weekend. My brother is now officially back in the United States after staying 10 long months in China. He flew into Chicago and my dad is meeting up with him in Toledo (It's cheaper to fly to Toledo than to Philadelphia, though for some reason it's kind of only costing me $10 to fly to Chicago from Philadelphia when I go to Japan). He's only back for a little over a month, but it'll be nice to see him. 

In other news, I bought a new easel (table-top sketchbox easel) and some artist acrylics (the ones I had before were craft acrylics and they're old) earlier and today/yesterday I painted a picture! It's of a glass of wine with a couple other things in it as well. I tried for realistic at first, but then abandoned it for a more post-impressionistic approach. Anyway, I really like it. Expect a picture of it soon.

Therefore, I think I may try other ways of getting money (in addition to working, of course). 

One in particular, is this idea:

I'm going to try to start one of those internet donation thingies, but rather than just begging for money, for every dollar that a person donates, I'm going to take personalized picture for them in Japan. That is, it will include at least their name, maybe more. Then, I will post all the pictures onto a website or blog or something. 

A little retarded, but maybe I'll be able to get something at least.

Well, I've finally gotten into summer mode, so I'm in a much better mood than I was at the beginning of the summer. I've been hired at Michael's (the arts and crafts store) but I don't start until Sunday. I'm not particularly excited about working there, but I guess I need a job. Hopefully they'll have enough hours available.

Because I haven't started working yet, I've been occupying my time mostly by making icons (which I'm getting better at :D) and playing Diablo II. There are a lot of things I want to do this summer, such as learn a lot more kanji, get through Japanese: The Spoken Language part 3 (and review everything from parts 1 and 2), get most of the story development done (if not more) for a manga, and also, possibly make a website (which would involve learning how to do that). I also definitely want to get better in the graphic arts department, hence the making of icons. 

So, enthralling entry as usual. :D

By the way, for those of you who did not see it, The Office season finale was the awesomeness (to use Theo's -ness form) and should be viewed by all (along with the rest of the season or series)."

That's not to say that I haven't been doing enjoyable stuff though (there's just that something in the back of my mind that keeps me from taking full advantage of the enjoyable-ness). Our new cable includes movie channels, which I find are very nice for watching movies that you might not ever rent, but kinda want to see. I finally saw Shaun of the Dead and LA Confidential, which are both very entertaining movies. 

My dad bought me a USB wireless adapter for my computer (I guess I lucked out, because he said it was ""the price of a bottle of scotch,"" that is, the cheap scotch he buys, so that's why he bought it, lol), so I've been able to get online with my computer, instead of hijacking my dad's. 

What I'd really like to do is play some good old fashioned video games.

Until then, I suppose I'll have to play some ps1 games. I guess there are some I still haven't beaten among those as well (FF5, Vagrant Story)

Also, while I want classes to end (even Japanese is driving me crazy right now), I'm sad that I won't be seeing some of my classmates anymore. I wasn't close to any of them, and I didn't talk to them outside of any class-related (or random meeting) context for the most part, so we won't be keeping in touch, but I still considered them my friends, and I'll miss having class with them. :("

I'm almost done with the second painting. It's a copy of the first Edward Scissorhands painting I did. While my other copy was pretty similar in quality to the original one, this one is ridiculously better than the first. When I did the original, I was going on my second night of not sleeping (it was at the end of finals week), but also I hadn't done an oil painting since high school. Even though I've only done a few paintings, I've definitely gotten better at handling the oil paints. 

I kinda feel bad though, because I'm thinking the woman might regret paying me for this original, even though it was her favorite of the two originals, lol. This new one is really a lot better.

By the way, Coral, do you know what's going on with that karaoke night? Joyner seems incapable of keeping members informed, or at least giving anyone any type of adequate notice. Was he considering not having it as some sort of punishment to members? Because most people didn't even sign up to do the performance, and he didn't really give people enough time in advance to participate in that Brazil thing.

Bridging is also done. I had to overnight that one because I realized the deadline meant they had to <i>have</i> it by that day, not that it had to be mailed by that day, lol.

The woman who had me paint her pictures of Edward Scissorhands for her doctor now wants copies of her own. This is very good because I need the money. I barely have enough in the bank for everything that I've already paid for. 

Just got my physical for study abroad. I think my left eye is getting worse. Then again, my eye is always blurry after I cover it, which doesn't help when I'm trying to read with it. And actually, it's not so much that it's blurry, it's more that the black that I'm seeing with my right eye interferes with what I'm seeing with my left eye. The doctor said I should see an eye doctor, but I sure as fuck don't need glasses, so I don't see the point. It's not like I walk around with my right eye covered.

I have today off of work, but I'm really tired, so I won't be taking much advantage of it (well, I guess sleeping would be the taking advantage part). I'm off tomorrow too, which is nice. 

Health insurance apparantly doesn't cover the $50 physical exam fee at Student Health because they don't accept outside insurance. I e-mailed them about how ridiculous I thought that was, and the guy told me that it's apparantly less stress to just have a student health fee, since we won't potentially have to fight with the insurance company. Well, what about when that damn fee doesn't cover something, asshole? Yeah, I think it's causing more stress. 

But anyway, I got my FAFSA done. I think my EFC as of right now is a bit higher than it really will be. I have to turn in some other supplemental financial aid-related forms to Pitt that I'm hoping will lower it.

That could actually be said today, but only about the weather. The rest of today kind of sucks. 

Though I was hoping to get at least a page written of my paper during the day today, I found myself in an unusually sleepy state and I couldn't think of anything to write. Though I'm more awake now (I've already had two lattes today), this probably does not bode well for the fact that I have to work from 4:30 until past midnight and then stay up all night writing a paper. Hopefully, the books I need to write the paper will not be checked out when I get off work.

Pittsburgh decided to take the employment tax (a whopping $52) out of this week's paycheck, which, of course, was timed perfectly with my having to pay the University of Illinois $500. Therefore, I had to increase my credit and get a cash advance. Lovely. 

Missed yet another opportunity to tell him, and it was a good one too. Unfortunately I was in a very nervous, worried state. Depending on how my paper goes tonight, I might be in class tomorrow, and maybe I'll tell him then, but we'll see. 

Now, off to work."

"event","i just found out a kid from school died last night, he was the year below me, but 2 years younger, he was 12 and he had lukemia, he'd been fighting it for a year, and i never talked to him at school, i dont think i ever really had a coversation with him even though i went to primary school with him too, but its made me think...

no-one should die that young, he hasn't been through anything hasnt had a chance to live, to learn, to experience life, i feel sorry for him, and his family, and it'll mean nothing to them because i never spoke to them, but this is just so that people know im not a heartless bitch and that i care, for his family and friends, and that i feel for them

"event","so, ive been on a cruise round the med for a week now, i feel like shit, tonight is my last nite the last few days have pretty much been a drunken blur.... but hey tonights the last day gota go out in style right? =) 

i feel like shit cos iim still with ben, or we're back together or in whatever state it was i posted last i dont remember, but we're together and i thought id be happy, but im not. He doesnt trust me and rightly so, i fuck him about and i lie to him and im too young and immature and too un aware of everyone elses feelings to be in a ""serious"" relationship, and when i was laid in bed the other night i tried looking at our relationship from someone elses point of veiw and its gona look dodgy as fuck, hes 6 years older than me 14 year olds and 20 years olds shouldnt be dating right?? 

God my heads all screwed up and i dont know wether its my hangover, my head or my heart talking. but im not happy anymore, and he keeps texting me or emailing me or calling me all the time telling me how im the only thing to keep him going and how much he loves me and im suffocationg, hes crushing me and most of all hes pushing me away from him by saying this. 

But i cant tell him because it'd crush him, i know i mean the world to him, and he did to me before, but i cant keep doing this, he lives in london i live in sheffield for a start. seriously 230 odd miles away. its fucking stupid. 

teenage angst. I know. i need someone to talk to."

"event","I'm so fucking sick of peopel screwing me over, i kno upto now i've written mainly bout lads an shit, an there's a lot more to me than that, i've been through way too much fucked up shit an i hate it, an i'm fed up of blokes screwing me over, firstly last summer there was aaron, he was 18 i was 13 an he lives like a million miles away (in newcastle bout 200 miles away) an i lost my virginity to him, an like a month after he was like ""oh yea theres this other lass i've been going with i dont want to be your boyfriend anymore"" i was completely heartbroken, i was like shit man, i'm never lettin anyone get to me like that again, i'm never going to fall in love again..
 
 then after that i went out with Adam in like october-end of november during which time i nearly got back together with my first bf from when i was 11 another adam, but that never happened and is still confusing to this day, anyway i slept with adam, an he was completely in love with me, but i knew that i was going to end up falling in love with him and so i pushed him away because i didnt want to be hurt again. so we split up an that was a messy break up so much so we still arnt on speaking terms :( 

 but durin the time i was goin out with adam i was talkin to this guy, Ben an we really hit it off, but a few people i knew had said he was really cocky an was a complete arse, but i was like hey what the fuck i really like this guy hes sweet an amazing an lovely an everythin, but then i went an dissed him big style on a message site so he didnt talk to me for ages, then one day out of the blue we start talkin an hes like ""i know why i said it before when i told you i loved you"" an that was it an we were goin out then i'd occasionally been freaking out cos im not very good at serious relationships after Aaron, an its like he put up with it an i could really talk to him an stuff, jus little things like hes one of the few people whos seen and heard me cry, but then its jus we keep getting into blazing arguments and i really dont want to fall in love because ill be hurt and thats exactly whats happened, hes finished me cos it isnt working anymore, and i dont want to argue with him, because if i just accept it it hurts less right? wrong. this is fucking killing me i hate him."

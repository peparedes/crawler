"event","so it's 9:45 am on saturday morning, and i am completely bored! nobody is online and everybody already has plans for something else. 

i want to go play golf, really badly. so if anybody knows of a cheap course that's not forever away from my house, please let me know and we should go hit it up sometime.

school is almost out, all i have left is the friggin spanish IB on tuesday, which i'm sure will go wonderfully :(. oh well, half days and then beach sounds pretty good to me. 

biggest accomplishments this year= my research paper being totally awesome (sorry Cara about yours) and crew went pretty well, too.

and now i'm dating Sarah, really long story behind that, but the point is that we are together now, so that's amazing... like her.

if anyone wants to actually read through my 3,530 word extended essay, Mr. Swan was actually suggesting it, so i'll put it on myspace in my one and only entry and i might put it on here as well. that would be a really long post though. haha.

i hope that everyone's summer goes extrememly way too well, and i hope to see you all!"

"event","today was alright, and it got better as it went... city championships: our men's JV8 won gold-sweetness- and so ends the legacy of the amazing 2006 Stanton MJV8+. i stroked the men's lightweight 4+ later, and sadly we got silver, but apparently 3 of Episcopal's 4 rowers were from their varsity 4 so (can you say stacking the boat). we'll get better though. we took the all points trophy again, and varsity 8 guys and girls both did amazing jobs and won the trophies for their events. ergo, GO STANTON!

later, after a nice nap, i went to see Ice Age 2 with Sarah, and then we went back to her house and watched Garden State, both amazing movies.

"event","i've decided that i pretty much suck at life, that i'll probably never be able to do things when it's the right time (if that even exists), and that i will undoubtedly let myself and others down... so what's new?

it's possibility that drives us insane, makes us regret, and causes us to stray from all we ever wanted

i hate trying to figure out what to do when, probably because i'm terrible at it, so if there's any chance i'm asking if you could just tell me what you want me to do

"event","when asked to speak at the memorial service, this is what my cousin Katie said of my grandmother who recently passed:

""A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. She sees that her tradong is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: 'Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.' Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.""

- Proverbs 31:10-31


Maybe you had to know her to really see the correlation, but know this: after this passage not a single eye in that church was left dry. My grandmother was an incredible woman, worthy of praise."

yesterday was a ton of fun. first was Jody's house in an attempt to have a sort of going away shin-dig for Sarah, but it didn't work out too well. sorry Sarah, hope you had fun anyways. after i took her home, i went to Abby's house to watch the english project again (hilarious by the way) and Brian and Jose were there too, and Catherine stopped by for a minute as well. then Abby invited me to come to a party at Lisa's house, which was when it really got interesting. 11 people + 1 Twister mat = fun times. we got there at like 7 and stayed for about 3 1/2 hours. thanks again Lisa for letting us all come over. 

wOOt! i finally got a job!!! pacsun at the avenues baby! i start training next week, then the week after that i'll start working. and i'm still trying for CIY this summer, because in the words of everyone else, it's awesome. i really hope i get to go.

if anybody is up for anything this weekend or like monday, i'm looking for a good time. haha."

""it's the possibility that keeps me going, not the guarantee, a sort of wager on my part. and though you may call me a dreamer or fool or any other thing, i believe that anything is possible. i realize the odds, and science, are against me. but science is not the total answer; this i know, this i have learned in my lifetime. and that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things.""

""The Last Song""
This may be the last thing that I write for long. Can you hear me smiling as I sing this song, FOR YOU AND ONLY YOU. As I leave will you be someone to say good-bye. As I leave will you be someone to wipe your eye. My foot is out the door, and you can't stop me now. YOU WANTED THE BEST, IT WASN'T ME, will you give it back. Now I'll take the lead, when there's no more room to make it grow. I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive, is this what you want. Is this what you need, how you end up let me know. As I go, remember all the simple things you know. My mind is just a crutch and I still hope that you will miss me when I'm gone. This is the last song. The HEARTS START BREAKING AS THE YEAR IS GONE. The dream's beginning and the time rolls on. It seems so surreal, now I sing it. Somehow I knew that I would be this way, somehow I KNEW THAT I WOULD SLOWLY FADE. Now I'm gone, just try and stop me now. And will you need me now, you'll find a way somehow. You want it, too. I WANT IT, TOO.

""Light with a Sharpened Edge""

Free from the torment of sin
All this I'm giving up
Much as the sun would decide to give in
Explode into orange
And hear all the voices sing praises with hymns
Mark the birth of a change
Free from the torment of sin
All this I'm giving up

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me so who am I now

Over and over again
Light with a sharpened edge 
Cut through the black empty space we call sky
Beginning the cycle that stays
And I know in my heart we all die
Like the day and the night
Like the sun in the sky
All this I'm giving up

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me so who am I now?

Is there another side?
Beyond the black and the white
Place I could meet you by
A place on the other side
I'll let you know when I go
When I'm gone

It's not me 
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me so who am I now?"

Left the only worries I had in my hands
Away from the light in my eyes
Holding tight and try not to hide how I feel

i stole this from jody ( i take a lot from jody):

Don't fill somebody 
Just because you think they're empty, 
But Flood them with love and friendship,
All of the time.

Don't catch somebody  
Just because you think they're falling,
But rather hold them above all hardship, 
And Keep them lifted high.

Never let Anyone get to the Point of Low.

"event","ok, so i stole this from someone else, but that's only because it's completely true... if only girls could see that...

Here are a few reasons 
why guys like girls: 

1. 
They will always smell good even if its just shampoo 

2. 
The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder 

3. 
How cute they look when they sleep 

4. 
The ease in which they fit into our arms 

5. 
The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world 

6. 
How cute they are when they eat 

7. 
The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end it makes it all worth while 

8. 
Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 outside 

9. 
The way they look good no matter what they wear 

10. 
The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you 
think she's the most beautiful thing on this earth 

11. 
How cute they are when they argue 

12. 
The way her hand always finds yours 

13. 
The way they smile 

14. 
The way you feel when you see their name on the call ID after you just had a big fight 

15. 
The way she says ""lets not fight anymore"" even though you know that an hour later.... 

16. 
The way they kiss when you do something nice for them 

17. 
The way they kiss you when you say ""I love you"" 

18. 
Actually ... just the way they kiss you... 

19. 
The way they fall into your arms when they cry 

20. 
Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly 

21. 
The way they hit you and expect it to hurt 

22. 
Then the way they apologize when it does hurt. (even though we don't admit it)! 

23. 
The way they say ""I miss you"" 

24. 
The way you miss them 

25. 
The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn't hurt her anymore..... Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish they would die or know that you would die without them ... it matters not.................... 
Because once in your life, whatever they were to the world they become everything to you. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their souls and you say a million things without trace of a sound, you know that your own life is inevitable consumed within the rhythmic beatings of her very heart. We love them for a million reasons, No paper would do it justice. 
It is a thing not of the mind but of the heart. A feeling. Only felt...
It is simply Indescribable."

"event","I think I'm allergic to the lemonade I'm drinking.

I've been getting a lot of compliments on my makeup.

Danny is a creep that won't leave me alone. It's not just me. Britt is getting it pretty bad too. Like it's really bad. We have been partying w/ Danny a lot because Mike likes to hang out w/ him. But he won't quit touching me. He won't quit telling me I'm cute. He is getting more & more carried away by the day. If we're all walking somewhere, he tries to hold me by his side. If we're sitting somewhere, he tries to sit behind me, put his legs around me, & massage my back. Then he tries to hold my hands. If I say I'm cold he tries to warm me up. If we're standing somewhere he pinches my butt. Hahaha I almost said nutt. Typo! If he's driving, he reaches back & caresses my legs. If I put myself down, he tells me he's going to cry. He shows up at my work w/o asking. He was there four times the other day. He told Ernie last night in Broulims when we were all there that Ernie doesn't need to worry. That it's ""not what it looks like."" Bullshit Danny! He might as well admit he's being obsessive. It makes me mad that he even does it to Britt, in front of Mike. He calls me & text messages me throughout the night. When I woke up this morning I had 2 voicemails from him & a text saying, ""I didn't get to feel you up!"" Well no fuck! Today I was in Subway eating lunch w/ Jess. I got a text from Danny saying, ""You look really good today."" I was like what the hell, I never even saw him. So I asked how he saw me & he said he saw me at Subway. I was inside though. I asked how & he said he has good eyes. Ahhhhh! He's practically admitting to stalking me, just not exactly. He told me he loves me last night.

Haha, last night, Ernie snuck me into his house. It was really funny & cute. When his family was up walking around I'd hide in his bed lol. And when they weren't we laid there & cuddled & talked. He told me I smelled really good. Like cigerettes, beer, & one of my perfumes. I thought he was being sarcastic at first, but he wasn't. He wouldn't let me go & I looked like shit. I had been partying out in the rain, & trying not to get busted by cops, & trying not to get fired all night. It was hectic. The power was out forever. But Danny's grandma saw us all. I was driving. And she decided to get on her cell phone & ""call someone."" So all of a sudden Nathan & Danny drive away from my car & Danny's grandma's car really fast. So I'm sitting there w/... five other people in my car not knowing what the hell is going on. Then Danny calls & tells me to get the hell out of there really fast. gal;'dkghald;kgh;ladkgh

I was supposed to be at work at 6 30 today. SIX THIRTY!!! So I went to my work last night & left my boss a note saying I'd be there at 8 because I didn't want to go there to learn how to set up breakfast since I already knew how. So I set my alarm like 3 times last night so I'd be there on time since I was already later than expected. And guess what? I sleep until after 8! Yeah... So I got there at like a quarter after 10. Oops. I called Ernie on my way to work. I was driving like 70 down Bates & this tan Chevy & I pass each other. I looked in my mirror & he was turning around. I was like, ""Ernie I think I'm going to have to go in a minute. I think I'm going to get pulled over."" So he asked me what kind of vehicle it was & told me he thought I was about to get pulled over too. But I never did.

Anyway, I'm going to go shower. I already showered this morning, but I want to shave my legs. And I have to pee, I haven't done that since I woke up. It's 5 30... bye.

OH! I was just typing in my music and I remembered something! One of the voicemails Danny left me last night haha... he was like, ""Chels... this song reminds me of you..."" And he played this song! Mike's told me it reminds me of him before too, but Mike's not trying to rape me!"

"event","I'm home. I got back at like 10 last night. Jeremy & Andrew were over here at my house w/ Tayson. I was home for like 10 minutes when Andrew got a phone call from some girl that was asking for directions to my house. When he got off the phone I was walking out the door again. And guess who was fucking driving up my driveway?? Katie. Fucking bitch. I had to go w/ Mandy (who brought my sister & I home) back to town because my very intellingent brother left my car there. But my keys here. Smart, eh? So I was just planning on going & getting my car & coming home. But it was so nice to drive around & be back in the valley that I didn't go immediatly home. I was driving down main street text messaging Ashley & Ernie called me. Once I told him I was in town I asked if I could get a hug & he told me to get over to his house. It was like 11. I picked him up & we left & went to the park. When he was about to get in my car I walked around to the passenger side to clean up so he could sit down & he walked up behind me & wrapped his arms around me. So I gave him a huge hug & told him how much I missed him. He kept telling me he knows & that he missed me too. After a while at the park we started argueing. It was really fucking stupid too. We didn't even have a reason to fight. And we cuddled up in the back seat & all of a sudden he got out of the car & walked away. I was so confused. So I followed him to the middle of the park after a minute of wondering what the hell was going on. He told me he wanted to walk home but didn't have shoes or a shirt w/ him. (Don't get any ideas, he didn't bring them in the first place.) So he was sitting there on one of those tree benches & told me he was mad at me because I kept bitching & there was nothing he could do about it. I sat down next to him & put my arms around him & he took my hand. Then after a while he turned & held me. He pulled me into his lap, stood up, & carried me towards my car. Stupid since I had shoes & he didn't. So I jumped down & walked in his arms to my car. Then I didn't want it to be all awkward so I jumped over on his lap & he held me & fell asleep in each other's arms. It was sweet. We apologized & I took him home. I sent him a text telling him I was sorry & he didn't reply. So when I woke up this afternoon I sent another one saying, "" 'I'm sorry too Chels.' I love how you always reply, thanks."" Hinting at him to apologize back because when he got out of my car things weren't exactly going smooth. But he just replied saying, ""u always r"". So I called to clear it up & I asked why he didn't just say he was sorry too & he said he could have but didn't. That pissed me off. Then he kept talking about other stuff & I just told him I didn't want to talk anymore. So I'm not very happy. This computer doesn't make me happy either. I shouldn't ever get online, IM people, read journals, or write in mine. There's no point.

All in all, here's what I got in Minnesota. I'm pretty excited about it.
1 tube top
1 pair of pants
4 pairs of jeans
6 camis
3 t shirts
2 sweatshirts
4 panties
1 bra
2 jackets
2 tanks
PJ pants
picture album that says MY BITCHES on it haha
Cargo blush
Bobbi Brown mascara
Smith sunglasses
MAC powder
Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue perfume
Headphones
Free CD
Urban Decay glitter eyeliner
Sephora makeup remover

I spent sooo much money. All the makeup I got was really expensive. One pair of jeans costed like 3 times more than jeans you buy in the mall here. My glasses were I think $140. I think the pants I got, not jeans, were like $60 alone. But I don't regret any of it. It's not often that I get to fly to the Mall of America & shop for 3 days straight.

So I'm going to go. I need to get ready & I might call Ernie again."

"event","I'm stressed out. I'm a complete homebody. I like to be able to go home & night & crash in my own bed. Get ready in my own house. Talk on my cell w/o paying a quarter a minute. Etc. I mean, I'm having fun. It's just... I miss things.

Last night we watched Guess Who. It was a good movie, really funny. But all the mushy gushy love parts, & all the sad relationship problem parts, made me tear up throughout the movie. I almost started just crying. And there was one part, it reminded me of Ernie more than any other part of the MILLION parts of the movie that reminded me of him. I wanted to go crazy & call him. But it was late. I got to talk to him tonight though! Like actually talk to him on the phone. Texting is better than nothing at all, but talking was like complete bliss! Aww, I love him so much! XoxoxoxooxoX! I sent him this text in while I was in the mall telling him I have a secret to tell him & that I miss him. So he texted me back saying ""Call me right now."" I couldn't though because my phone was dying. But I let him know & he told me to call when I could. So when we left I called him immediately off my mom's phone. He didn't answer, so I left him a message letting him know how reliable he is haha. But he was just on the other line & called me back almost immediately. Hadn't even listened to the voicemail. He said he didn't even wait long enough to see that he had a message, he just called the number right back to talk to me. He was w/ Danny. I couldn't talk long because of the roaming, but dk;lghaldghadglkad It made my night sooo much better. I could've cried just thinking about talking to him. I can't wait til Thursday when I get back & can jump into his arms. Like when he got back from Lake Mead last year after two weeks. Awww he came to meet me & walked right up to me & told me to get in his arms. I can't wait to replay that!! 

Aww, it'll be nice to get home. I saw aww a lot. Oh well. One more day of shopping coming up. I got a looot more today. It kicked butt! I feel spoiled, but I saved up for this!

I have to go to bed though. I need sleep so I hopefully won't get sick AGAIN. Night night. Mwah!"

"event","I'm in Minneapolis right now. Our hotel room is so lame! I'm pissed. It's small. And it's like high crime rate just because of the area of the city. We're really close to the Mall of America. But there are like safety warnings everywhere. We were thinking about asking for a different room because this one is so stupid. But I'm sure we'll live through it. Three more nights to go.

We were at the mall for like 12 or so hours today. And we're probably going to do the same thing for the next two days. I got sooo freaking sick around dinner time tonight though. We ate in one of the restaurants in the mall & when we were waiting to be seated I couldn't even stand. And 3 minutes before then I was absolutely fine. And then once we sat down at our table to eat, I was curled over trying not to cry, but I couldn't even help it. My stomach hurt so so bad. So I just tried not to make it obvious that I was sick & crying. Then I started to feel better in about 30 minutes. But it was horrible.

The shopping was good though. If I remember right, so far I got: 2 pairs of jeans, a pair of panties, a bra, a jacket, 2 sweatshirts, 2 t shirts, a tube top, a bracelet, some MAC powder & mascara, a really cute pair of stretch pants from Bebe Sport, a tank top... I think that's it. We went to this big sunglass store where they sell Chanel, Christian Dior, Armani, & all those really expensive brands. I tried on glasses that were up to $300! It was so fun. Haha, all the big ones that the celebrities where. But I think I'm going to get some Smith ones from there. They're really expensive, but I think it's worth it. I'm still deciding. And I think I'm going to get some Dolce & Gabanna perfume tomorrow that I really like. Not that I need more perfume... haha but oh well.

I could go on & on, but I'll stop here w/ all the mall crap.

I'm having fun, but I've already wanted to be home at some points in the past two days. I miss people. I miss Ernie. I talked to him through text messaging last night. But I really want to see him! I think I might call him here in a second. I'm going to go. I'll be home Thursday for those of you who are staying at my house!!!! Xooooxoooooxxxxxxo"

"event","So I worked from 8 30 til 5 30 today. Then I went to Subway to hang out w/ Celie & Ashley before I leave in the morning. I had dinner there & talked to Celie for a bit. I told her I wanted to call Ernie before I went home to pack to make sure we couldn't see each other again before I leave. She told me I could only call if I wouldn't get upset if he couldn't see me for some reason. So I bucked up & called. He was like all excited when he answered. He was like, ""I was JUST about to call you!"" He is camping tonight & was already gone. So we talked for a while & when he had to go he told me to call him while I'm in Minnesota. That's my FAVVVVORITE part about being away from each other. We can't help but call each other, even if it's not easy to communicate where our cell phones don't even work. But like when he went to Utah a couple months ago. He kept calling me & telling me how he missed me. So of course I'm going to do as he asked & call him. And he also told me to be careful. That reminds me of how Tayson acted when I left for Europe last summer. He called me while I was in SLC the night before. I was staying at Mac's sister's house w/ him & Tayson called me & told me to be careful. And he told me that he loves me, I cried. It scares me to leave sometimes, but I think that it's usually good for at least one reason.

I still need to finish packing. I packed all the outfits I'm bringing, & a few pairs of PJs, & my bikini, & extra jeans. That only took up like 1/4 of my suitcase, at the most. All my outfits are small so my suitcase is practically empty. It'll be so light. Not when I come home though. I haven't even started packing my carry on. It seems like it's a lot later than midnight. I'll probably be up until Ernie calls me like he always does in the night. I'm going to go now & look at all the stores in the Mall of America that I'll get to shop at! Damn, I'm going to miss the drama while I'm gone..."

"event","When you said you loved me, did you really love me, or did the words just spill out like drool on my pillow? 'Cause I was naked when you said those words, but I felt covered in your whispered worship. And as you passed out fast on my shoulder, I imagined a child waiting so sad and still for his mom to arrive. Did she leave you an orphan in that big, brown leather chair? Said, ""Don't you move a muscle, kid, I'll be back in twenty years."" You were scared, you were lonely, but you must've been aware; life is a series of calluses, this is just another layer. So, build 'em up, tough it out, yeah, that's your skin - don't let anyone under there.

When you said you needed me, did you really need me or was it just someone - oh, you'd take anything. Am I first on that list of yours, or am I second, or third? So, who's that ahead of me, some harlot from Pittsburgh? Or Detroit, Santa Fe, or San Diego? I know you're so alone, but how much affection does one guy really need?

Did you date a lot in high school? Were you always chasing girls? Couldn't you find some young valentine to steal your heart for good? Were you content, or contemptible? Are your memories pleasant, or is it a string of endless flings of bitter resentment? Seems that what you want and what you need doesn't mean a thing, we're just here for the taking.

When you said you'd hurt me, did you think you hurt me? Are you really that cocky? Oh, what a heartbreaker! Well, I've got my armor - yeah, I've been through some battles before - and I met your old girlfriend, she said, ""Baby, don't bother."" She told me you told her you'd hurt her... funny, how familiar. So, how much of this relationship was rehearsed?

**When I started typing this, Randy Travis' song, Deeper Than The Hollar, started playing. It still is. And I started thinking that it probably sounds like I'm accusing Ernie of a bunch of negative things by what I'm typing, but I'm not. I love him. I just wanted to write this. This song means a lot to me & my relationship w/ Ernie. A lot. I'll never forget when we first started dating & while cuddling in his truck one night, this song came on & he held me tighter as the chorus played.**

Did you act out as a child? Were you always crying wolf? Attention-starved, you tried too hard to get someone to look. Now you're the wolf in second-hand clothing; I'm the sheep in the pleated skirt. It's an awkward form of payback, but if it works for you - it works. It's that I recognize your off-white lies, still, I lie beside you - and that's what really hurts.

When you said you'd leave me... well, why haven't you left me? What are we still doing here, so desperate for company? There's a greyhound on Jackson Street, there's an airport in Council Bluffs... hell, there's a car in the driveway - fifty ways to get lost.

Bus as I hold you and listen to you sleeping, I'm starting to wonder if you really believe that you'd ever really leave. Would you leave me, an orphan, in that big, brown leather chair? The one you've lugged around from town to town for all these years. It's the trophy of your childhood, like a shark's tooth or gator skin boots - but this one holds you prisoner - it holds me prisoner too. What we need to set us free is to let go of each other - let go of everything.

When I said I loved you, it was because I love you. When I said I needed you, well, I really need you. Yeah, I guess you hurt me, for once you're a man of your words. Well, guess what - I'm leaving - I can't be your prisoner.

I won't.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm not leaving Ernie. None of that was really directed to us. Although, parts made sense. Celie found that & posted it in her journal a while back. I printed it & found it. It just made me think. But some of it I find really stupid."

"event","Last night I went to a party up Horse Shoe w/ Ray. I had talked to Ernie earlier, before the plans for the party were made. So Ernie didn't know I was up there when he was on his way. And that's fine, he didn't care. But before he got there something was said that upset me a little. So I went & called him away from the fire to talk to him about it. At first he didn't take me seriously & just told me that I get mad a lot. I told him thanks for trying to understand. And he said sorry & asked me what was going on. So I explained & then he really took me seriously. He told me he'd be there in a few minutes & to just not let it get to me. He told me I know better than to believe just anything because him & I are the ones that know the truth.

I met Danny Little at the party last night. I'd seen him before, but never really talked to him. He started hitting on me. Throwing ice cubes down my shirt & a bunch of other stuff. I know Ernie was watching, so I felt better about it. Just because he saw that I didn't act that way towards Danny also. Then I noticed I had a new voice mail but not a missed call. It wouldn't let me call myself though where we were so I asked to borrow someone's phone to check my message. Danny went clear over to his car to let me use his phone. Then once I gave it back he used my number in his phone to send me a text message saying, ""You're cute."" He was standing right next to me... I said thanks, & it made me feel good, but compliments always mean the most when they come from who I really love. Ray & I went to leave & Ernie & I just held each other for a bit. I whispered to him about the text message & he laughed. He didn't take it seriously at the time. Then I told Ray on the way home about the text message & he was like, ""Well yeah! That's because you are cute. Everybody thinks so."" I was like, ""Not everybody."" And he was like, ""If I think you're cute, most everybody does too.""

Later I was home sleeping & I got another text at about 1 in the morning. It didn't wake me up. But then at 1 30ish my phone rang. I didn't pick it up in time but it was Danny. So I figured if he left a voicemail & it was important I'd call him back today, but he didn't. Then I noticed the text & it said, ""Can I get to know you?"" I replied telling him I'd talk to him another time because I was sleeping & told him to drive careful. He said, ""Thanks but I'm staying up here. Too drunk to drive home. Hopefully talk to you again!"" Hahaha, so I asked if he was staying up there alone & he said yes, that he was waiting for me. Riiight... I just laughed & said goodnight. And when he said goodnight he added ""hugs & kisses"" at the end. What?! Mr., you don't know me! Yet, I was curious as to if he knew about Ernie & I. And yes... he does. Because at about 2 Ernie called me telling me he just got home & wanted to talk for a while. I told him about the texts. Then on my way to work this morning I called him because I was having problems at home & I needed to talk to him. He listened to me, helped me out, & then asked about Danny talking to me. I told him details about everything & he got really mad. He kept saying how he couldn't believe Danny would do that to him. I was like, ""Well, does he even know that you've had something w/ me for almost a year now?"" And Ernie told me that he's told Danny all about me. I knew he told Ben all about me, details, but not Danny. But I guess he does, & now he thinks not too highly of Danny's actions. And I told him I understand & that it's not like he needs to worry at all. And I told him how I'm mad about certain things like that also. He told me he knows & I'm just keeping in mind that he told me ""I know better."" And I'm going to trust that.

And last night, when Ernie & I were holding each other, he started talking to me about his dad. He told me that yesterday morning his dad was like, ""Ernie, I think the two of you stretched out the hammock a little last night."" Not literally, but yeah. And I guess that while Ernie & I were out laying on the hammock together at his house the night before, his dad went outside for a minute & saw us. He watched us for a minute & told Ernie that the entire time I was giggling. No big surprise, I am happy as can be when I'm w/ Ernie. But I guess Ernie's dad was telling him that he likes me & stuff. That really makes me happy. Sheila likes me, Gary likes me, Ben likes me, Derek likes me, Nick likes me, maybe I'll eventually win over every Beard's &hearts;. Haha, not all lovey ish just yeah... you know what I mean.

I went tanning after work today. I put tanning accelerator on my face, & I normally don't. So my face is already burning. I'm sure a lot of other parts of my body will too.

I'm going to go shower."

"event","I have to pee so bad! Kayla's probably surprised that I even use the word pee. But I do. But I don't want to go because I have to go see what hotel rooms aren't being used, & use that one to go to the bathroom in. Then I have to refold the toilet paper roll, get them another bar of soap, & a clean hand towel. Although, I'll probably just hope the wet hand towel dries. Since I'm not a guy, I won't have to reclean the toilet. I can aim. And I can squat. Impressive eh?

I'm only at work from 1 til about 5 30 today. And I was supposed to be here at 1 so the managers could leave & go to the doctor, but they're still here & it's 2 now. Dirty liars.

I hope I find something to do after work. I don't look half bad today, so I want to do something other than sit at Subway or go home. My mom sewed up one of my shirts that I haven't been able to wear forever because the ribboning was falling off, so I got to waer it today. Finally! And then my belt & panties match haha. And my skirt's cute, & my legs are shaved, & my hair is straightened & all soft. But my makeup looks shitty. Oh well.

Maybe I'll call Ray later or see if Ernie calls me or I dunno.

So for those of you who read my entry a few days ago that was about that guy Anthony. I have some more recent news to add. Again, he is extremely gorgeous!!! He's like 23, but still way hot. And anyway, I see him EVERYWHERE!! I've already seen him twice today. And hey, I don't mind. Not at all. It's just a bit awkward when you never really share a conversation, but you do acknowledge one another. But I literally see him almost every day at least once. Today I was driving down main street to my parent's office & he was pulling out of the old Broulim's parking lot. I saw him before he saw me & it's not like I wanted to be all awkward & turn & look at him as I passed. So I just pretended I didn't see lol. Then I was just coming into Tetonia & was about to turn into the hotel & he was driving the opposite direction. He waved. Lol, it's not like I was all like, ""Eeeek!!! Anthony just waved to meee!"" But I was actually kinda surprised because we really don't know each other at all. We just see each other so often that it would be rude not to wave or say hi. He is soooo fine though. Awww. He's tall, & tan, & has dark hair, ;jaflkdshfa I can't really make him sound as hot as he is. But wow. I'll never forget the first time we saw each other. It was like stupidly wonderful haha. He came into my parent's office while I was vacuuming & nobody was helping him. So I asked if I could help him & he just sat there staring at me w/ his mouth open & this huge smile on his face. He was like, ""Uhhh... umm.. yeah... I'm here to pick something up from, ummm... Sam."" It was literally like that or worse. And yes, I was staring at him too, but I could still talk. Then I had my fun bending over while he was standing there w/ Sam. Hahaha, I'm such a girl. Then my mom was all going crazy when she found out, telling me she wanted to hook us up because he works in another Real Estate office & blah blah blah. But now I really know what kind of guy he is, & I don't know about us hooking up. He's more into the drunken orgys & one night stands as far as I've heard. But a guy's gotta settle down sometime... hopefully. I wish Ernie would get to that point!!!!!!!!

Looky Kayla, I updated!!! Now I'm going to go pee & fold laundry & bring a roll-a-way bed to a room & something to the breakfast room. I wish some hot guy would come check in. I'd already have his number from the reservations!! Not that I'd call him or whatever, I'd feel too guilty. Anyway, I guess I'm going to go read or something."

"event","I AM SO DAMN BORED!!!!!! I cannot believe I stayed home all freaking day. My sister was just like, ""Have you been here allll day??""...""That's wierd."" Yeah, really wierd. Really stupid.

I just got out of the hottub & I'm sitting at our kitchen table in my bikini. It's kinda cold, but pretty comfy.

I guess Tayson is taking Sarah Hatch on a date to the movies right now. He came home in a huge hurry & changed to meet her in time. I could tell my mom wanted my opinion on it, but honestly, I don't even know what to think about that one.

I really want to leave right now!

I guess I'm going to go put on some lil skanky barely cover my ass boxers & be lazy like I have been all day. I have to find something to do after work tomorrow. And all this sitting around w/ nothing to do is causing me to eat a lot. Goodbye."

"event","It's windy out, so it's tempting to go get in the hottub. That'd be really relaxing. I invited Kayla to come hottub at my house w/ me, but she said she wouldn't if her life depended on it. Then she kept telling me she DOESN'T like me. What a bitch. Now she's saying nasty words!!!!

I slept until 3 30 today. I got phone calls before then, but just went back to sleep. My manager called me & asked me to work, but I told her no. It's my day off. Then she called Cassandra & asked her to work, but Cass told her no. Shantay & Marisol were supposed to be there! Besides, I have to work the next three days, probably totally by myself. Everyone is going to girls camp. Even Bob said he's going... that's just a stupid excuse Mr.

I get Friday off, work Saturday, then I'm going out of town really early on Sunday morning. I'll be in Minnesota on Sunday evening. Then I will be back to my house on Thursday night. My mom is staying another night in SLC. And my dad is driving down to meet her so they can get stuff for our new house. So there won't be any parents here that night. Maybe I'll invite all my guy friends over at different times throughout the night & have all sorts of fun. Hahaha, Club, Ritz, AND Saltine. I think only Bailey will get that...

If anyone saw me right now, they wouldn't believe their eyes! I'm just so damn gorgeous, I can't get over it. NOOOOTTTTT! The reason I said they wouldn't belive their eyes is because I didn't do my hair. And that doesn't mean I just woke up & haven't fixed it up yet or anything. That means I got out of the shower, let it air dry, & I look like Medusa. Worse. I practically have a fro. Whenever Tayson sees me like this, he hands me a bottle of lotion & tells me to put it in my hair. It's bad. It's like 3 times thicker looking, & at least 3 inches shorter from all the curls/waves/frizz. That & I only have eyeliner & mascara on. So hardly having my makeup on makes me look a lot worse than normal too.

I've told Kayla this, but not really anyone else. The other day, I went to go to work. I was going to go out the door on the bottom level next to the garage door. I remembered that my dad put a trap out to catch skunks though, & he puts that right by the door because that's where the dog feeder is. So rather than opening the door to see a skunk 2 feet in front of me like I have before, I looked out the window first. There was a huge racoon in the trap totally freaking out. So I went up to go out the front door. And I needed to be at work early, so I was trying to hurry. I walked across the porch to the top of the stairs & looked down before running out to my car. There were like at least 5 other racoons running around by the bottom of the stairs. They were all freaking out & I know racoons are really mean. So I WALKED BRISKLY back into the house & got my dad. But it was pretty scary. They were all looking up at me & froze in place, so I decided not to stick around before they decided to move again lol. I think the poor thing is still down in the trap. It doesn't hurt him or anything, but that would suck.

I was in the shower a little bit ago & my phone wouldn't stop ringing! One of the times it was Ernie, so I called him back when I got out of the shower. We didn't really get along that well. We did at first. But then I think he started to realize that he was being a jackass. And I let him know it after a while. So he told me I was making him mad. And I told him he was making me mad too. And I said, ""I'm going to go now, bye."" And hung up the phone before letting him reply. He didn't call back, but Kyle called me. So once Ernie finds that out, it'll be enough to make him feel guilty.

I'm going to go. I really need to get caught up on laundry before I have to pack & have no clean clothes."

Actually, in this moment, I think of love as something I REALLY need. Flirting around & playing is always fun, but I'd give that up forever for love. I wouldn't be FORCED to break up w/ someone that is insecure or in constant need of reassurance. It would be wierd, especially compared to what I have now, but I think I'd just work on getting him to change. I can't really seem myself w/ someone like that though. The one about being against cheating & treasuring marriage are both very true for me. And I definately want a relationship I can grow w/ that will last. The others are pretty true about me too."

"event","Awwww! Being at Ernie's house was so much fun last night! Except he kept gettin mad at me because I was laughing so loud. I wasn't actually laughing loud at all, but if I did anything louder than a whisper he freaked & it made me laugh harder. So we were on the couch, under a blankie, covering my face in his arms so it didn't seem like I was laughing as much as I really was. Then my cell kept ringing & in that quiet house & seemed really loud. So I kept jumping up to grab it before it woke his dad up. Then everytime I was talking on my phone he'd do really abnoxious things to make me not pay attention to the phone call. And he'd go crazy kissing me & being all psycho. And his freaking kisses were louder than me laughing, so he was being a dumb hypocrite telling me to be quiet. gj;sl'kghs;dflkghsdl;kg We're so damn cute together when we're getting along like that!!! As stuck up as that is, it's true! I remember when we first started dating, I took him & Jess to a party at Ray's house & on the way home he kept kissing me & hugging me while I was driving. Jess was just sitting in the back being all jealous. And when Ernie got out of the car she went off about how cute we were. I know I know, it's just because he's so cute & sexy himself! I wonder what he's doing RIGHT NOW...? But I'm not going to call him. Besides, I'm at work for another 3 hours, til 10.

WHAT THE HELL!?!? I just went to use this red sharpie, I took the lid off, & it's a freaking lidded screw driver!!!! Who has that? AAAAAHAHAHAHAHA! It has two sides, so I thought the other side would be the marker, & it's a mini screw driver! da;lgadhg;kdlsahg;lkadjghadljk

I have to go put in another load of laundry. If I don't keep up on it, I won't get done by 10, there is so much!

***Doing laundry***

Okay, I'm back. But the next load is almost done, so I'll just have to go fold more & more laundry. It gets really old. But I finally taught myself how to fold fitted sheets, kinda.

The girls that I work w/ drive me so insane, I don't even know how to react. Today I got here at 3 & Cassandra had been here since like 9. She did 11 rooms by herself by the time our bosses foster daughters did 4 rooms TOGETHER!! So there were 8 rooms left to do. I did 4 by myself & worked in the office for a little bit. Shantay (one of the girls) came in to give me the phone because her mom needed to talk to me. I was on the phone for 5 to 10 minutes & I went to help the girls finish because they had to hurry & get home. THEY HAD ONLY DONE 2 ROOMS TOGETHER by the time I did my rooms & everything else I did. What the hell can take them so fucking long?! So I went to help them so they could get out of here & they totally sucked up to me. I know they talk shit about me behind my back all the time, so it was stupid. Shantay was all like, ""We're doing sooo good now! Thanks to CHELSEA!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"" Yeah Shantay... no problem. The other girl is Marisol. I think she's a sophomore this coming year, Mexican, has a baby. Shantay's not from here, she refuses to go to Teton High School, so she goes to Pocatello. Hahahah Pocky. Sorry Bailz. But those two girls sure as hell know how to talk shit. When I got here Cassandra was like, ""Yeah, so Shantay hates you. She thinks you're gothic because you wear more makeup than she does. Blah blah blah."" Cassandra probably agrees w/ her & acts all fickle like any other little insecure girl would. But I certainly like Cass & lot more than how the others act. And yeah... I'm definately gothic. That's why they point out that I'm wearing white pants to work. White flippies. Pink & red tank. My hair is brown w/ blonde highlights. Oooh, so much black. I could talk shit back, but it's not even worth it. I'm older than all of them, & I act it.

I'm sure more laundry is ready to be folded, so once again, I have to go. Byebye <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3"

"event","Speaking of ironic stories...
Tonight I'm in Subway hanging out w/ Celie, Ashley, Jeff, & Miguel. It got pretty busy around like 7 30 to 8. Jeff & Miguel decided the wanted to eat so while they're up there deciding & being total pains in the ass, someone else pulls in. It's one of the newer Dodge diesel trucks. It looked almost exactly like my brother's (Travis), yet I didn't think anything of it, because I knew it wasn't his. Then the driver comes in & I realize it's this guy named Anthony. I'm 99% sure that nobody that reads this will know who he is. He's in his early 20s, & works for one of the other real estate offices here in the valley. He is really really good looking. And one time when I was at my parent's office cleaning he came in & was staring at me & couldn't stop smiling. THEN I thought he was a total good guy & just thought he was cute. But then later I learned differently. My sister in law, Mandy, decided to hook her little sister, Haley, up w/ Anthony on a date about a month ago. (Mandy always does that to the guys I think are cute, it's annoying, but I don't care too much because I'm not interested in other guys.) I find out a few days after their ""date"" that they practiced some pretty dirty habits on their FIRST date. He even stayed the night at her house in Jackson on the first night they met. My mom thinks it's fun to always ask me to bring things to the office he works at when they need things from our business. So I always run into him & we drool over each other for a minute. ANYWAYS, while Anthony is standing in line behind Jeff & Miguel in Subway tonight I glanced over at him & our eyes caught. We smiled at each other, looked away, blah blah blah. THEN, this guy I work w/ walks in. His name is Chad, he's probably in his early 30s, has memory problems, but he's fairly normal. Other than all the singing & skipping he does. But I guess Anthony & Chad are actually there to eat dinner together. Wierd. I didn't understand, still don't. I'll have to ask Chad some day. I'm sure nobody thinks it's as wierd as I do. Ohh! AND! Mandy went on some school trip sort of thing her senior year. This other girl named Emily also went. (At this time Emily & my brother were dating.) Mandy & Emily were talking one night in their hotel room when they start talking about Travis (my brother.) Emily was sitting there talking about how her boyfriend didn't care if she cheated on him. Bullshit. And she later brought some guy back to the room that she didn't know & had sex w/ him. Later Travis & Emily break up. Mandy starts dating Travis. Mandy suddenly realizes one night that Travis is the guy that Emily was dating when she was cheating on him & telling everyone that Travis didn't care. So Mandy told Travis about it. And they later, I don't know when, find out that Emily was also sleeping w/ Anthony while dating Travis. People are so shitty. So Anthony, who caused Emily to cheat on Travis, who ended up marrying Mandy, is the sister of Haley, who did naughty things w/... of all people, Anthony! And I also found out that Anthony & this other girl, no names, had this big orgy thing a while back. Niiice Anthony, real nice.

Today a lot of us were all talking outside of Kwik Way. Miguel was off talking to Jake Debban, John Eagan, & Tyler Lamphier for a bit. And he comes back to me & calls me CR. I asked him to explain & he was like, ""I guess that's your nickname according to those guys."" Okay... really freaking clever. And Miguel told me that all those guys were like saying all this crap like, ""Is it just us or is 'CR' really lookin hott this summer??"" Ahhh! Get over your hormones!

Hahaha! Tayson just got home & came in my room to see when I'd be done w/ the laptop. Then he was just standing there in my doorway & was randomly like, ""Why are your toes spread...?"" Lol I realized I had all my toes spread out. Hahaha, how wierd. It was pretty funny if you were here. Which you weren't...

Lol, it was so funny tonight. Chad would do really stupid, childish things in Subway & Anthony would just get this wierd ass confused look on his face & look at me like 'What the hell?' I just laughed. Which reminds me of something else that made me laugh sooo much tonight.

So Jeff, Miguel, & I are driving around, hanging out. They were drinking & we went out by Big Eddy. I was sitting in the middle, between them. All of a sudden Jeff just starts touching my arm, tickling it, etc. I think Miguel noticed, but we just kinda ignored it & let Jeff be wierd. Then Jeff went to open the window behind us & oh so smoothly used that as an excuse to put his arm around me. I looked over at Miguel & we burst out laughing. Jeff was really messed up & didn't catch on, thank goodness. We laughed for so long though. Jeff would be like, ""What's so funny? Should I be laughing?"" And I'd just tell him yes. So this went on for ever & ever. My cell phone rang & it was Ernie. He went to Broulims, saw my car parked there, & called me. More about that later. But I thought that Jeff might kind of start to think & realize what he's doing while I'm talking to practically my boyfriend. But no. He kept his arm right there. After time Jeff starts to gradually pull me closer to him. Miguel & I just laughed our asses off. I decided we should leave & go back to Driggs. Jeff was really bad, couldn't drive. So I drove his truck back to town & the entire way he proceeded to touch me! I said something about how I couldn't drive in my 3 inch platforms. So for an excuse to put his hand on me knee, he offered to reach down & take my shoe off for me, which was already off! His hand moved from my knee, to between my legs, as far up as I let him go w/o pushing him away. I was hoping it wouldn't get to that point because I knew he was just messed up, but ahhh! And the whole time he was being all quiet & wierd. So Miguel got out of the truck for a minute & Jeff hurried & told me that ""I knew what he was depressed about & thinking about."" I said I really didn't know, & he was like, ""You. I have feelings for you."" And then he wouldn't stop looking at me while I was driving so I finally asked him to stop staring at me & he said he couldn't because I am too beautiful. ;glhshdglkdhgd;lgsd'gkaugie

Anyway, when we were at the Big Eddy, Ernie called the first time. I asked what he was going to do & he said he didn't know. He was complaining that nobody likes him, he has no friends, he didn't know where to go. Yeah... Ernie having no friends or nothing to do, we'll never see the day. He asked when I'd be back to Driggs & I was teasing him saying, ""Why? Do you wanna hang out w/ me?? I know you do. Admit it. You miss me."" And the little cutie admitted it. He was laughing saying how much he wanted me to hang out w/ him. So he told me he was going to go home & shower & call me back. A little while later he calls again. After, by the way, Jeff was asking if I'd stay w/ them if Ernie didn't call. Ernie told me to call him when we got to Driggs. Then I went over to his house & hung out w/ him for about an hour before I had to come home. I don't know if it was all of Driggs, but his power was out. Plus it's a new moon, so it was totally pitch black everywhere. I walked in using my cell phone as a light & ran into him who was doing the same thing. Then he made me go pee in the dark before acusing me of being drunk. Jokingly. I told him I only had 1 1/2 & he was like, ""Yup, you're drunk."" But I wasn't. I sat down on his couch & he was lying there under a blanket. He opened up the blanket for me to join him & I was kinda like, ""What are you doing?"" Lol he was like, ""I thought you would be cold."" Pshh, lame way to beg me to cuddle up w/ you. But I did it anyway. I know that he really does love me, so I just love him back w/ all my heart. But it was just really cool that we couldn't even watch TV or anything because of the power. We just lied there in the dark together wrapped up in each other's arms. And aww it's just so nice how we talk so openly & comfortably together. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;And usually now that we're broken up he's hesitant to kiss me goodnight when he walks me to my car, but he didn't hesitate at all. And still, everytime we say goodbye, he says, ""I'll talk to you TOMORROW."" Not later, not sometime, but tomorrow. And he will. He'll call me.

Maybe Mike is right & things between Ernie & I really just can't end."

"event","I don't think that my ""deadjournal friends"" are very happy w/ me having a livejournal lol. It's not like they say anything, but I hardly ever update on there anymore, because I always update on here. I'm sure they don't really care, besides, they never update either. IF YOU READ THIS, THAT'S A HINT!

Well, parts of me are still sensitive from my sunburn lol. But it's getting better! Now I won't have to complain to Kayla about my burnt boobs as much.

I had the worst night last night! Like, I mean sleeping. Compared to what I wrote last night about wanting to be in bed in Ernie's arms, ahh it was so much different! I fell asleep on the couch watching TV like I said I was going to. Then I woke up sometime in the 3:00 hour. I was still REALLY drunk. I guess I went to my bed then. Then I woke up at 4 30ish & couldn't sleep. My nose was so stuffy, so I blew my nose & I immediatly got a bloody nose. ON BOTH SIDES! I don't know why, it was so stupid! Sorry about talking about blowing my nose lol. And I was really thirsty, hot, & uncomfortable. It sucked bad. I thought I was going to have a horrid hangover, but I'm really not too bad. Just definately not in the mood to get ready.

Tonight some of the guys are going to Boise until Sunday. I know Scott is going for sure, it's his idea. But I don't know who all is going w/ him. I'm pretty sure Brett is. So they won't be here for the weekend, & Kyle won't either because he's gone to work. So that leaves Ernie, Jason, Ray, Billy... Mike said he might go to Boise, but I doubt he will. So I don't know what is going to go on tonight. But I'm certainly not drinking like I did last night, if I do at all.

Like I said last night, Ernie called me yesterday. I was at Subway w/ Mike & Bridger & my phone rang. I was like, ""I'll bet you anything it's Ray."" So I went to talk to Ray & it said Ernie. I was really surprised. We had talked for like 20 seconds & he was like, ""Danny (Little) just wrecked his Suburban! I'll call you back!"" Haha, so he called back like 3 minutes later & told me the story. I guess Danny was bleeding but everything was okay. He asked where I was & I told him so he said he'd stop on his way home. He's so hot w/ his tan!! I wanted to jump over Bridger (I was sitting between him & Mike) & jump into his tanned, sexy arms.

I hope I get to hang out w/ him tonight. I know I need to be careful, but the things Mike said last night about Ernie & I made me want to be w/ him right then. Mike just kept telling me how he can't see Ernie & I ever being over. And how it will work out. It's just so hard to think that if it does, it might take more time than I'd like.

I really need to go eat & shower. I feel really nasty."

"event","I hung out w/ Mike tonight. After I got off work I went to Subway because Celie didn't have any friends working w/ her. I got a salad & while I was eating, Mike & Bridger showed up. So I left w/ them. But Bridger left to go to the movies w/ Tara, so Mike & I hung out. It's so insane how him & I can be such good friends & NOTHING more. I love it. We can just talk & talk & understand each other. We got in this REALLY serious conversation about are relationships w/ Ernie & Britt. Mike told me everything that he feels about Britt & it was so sweet. And he kept telling me that he really honest to God thinks that Ernie & I WILL end up together again. He said it might take a while. He said I might need to finish school first. We have a little growing up to do, but he said he sees Ernie & I together for good. He kept talking about how it will be when we're all older & Ernie & I are together & him & Britt are together. I started crying in the conversation. I was upset thinking it really won't work out. It might not... But I hope so much. gs;lhgdlghsLGHD:Sk I love Ernie to death. Mike told me to just give it all the time needed. And he said that he thinks that Britt & I are the only two girls in the valley that can actually date cowboys & know how to put up w/ it. Haha, it was cute.

Anyway, I could say soooo much more. Like how much I'm eating right now. Or how tired I am. Or how fast I'll pass out here on my couch watching TV. But I just want to sign off & relax. I'll update tomorrow. I love you, Ernie! Thanks for calling me tonight. I knew he'd come around. At least to an extent. He can't help himself lol. He loves me too, whether he tells me it enough or not. Every time I told Mike that Ernie doesn't love me tonight, Mike would cut me off to tell me that Ernie DOES love me. I wish I could be in Ernie's arms right now. In bed w/ him. Fast asleep dreaming about how much I love him & want to be w/ him forever. I want to wake up again to see him & feel so extremely lucky that I caught him. I love you, baby!"

"event","I'm so bored. I got here, to work, an noon. I only had two rooms to clean. Then my boss had me help her clean out the laundry/storage room. Now all I have left to do is one load of laundry, & empty a trash can. But I have 4 hours til I get to leave, at 8, so I have a feeling I'm going to be online for a long time.

Right now I'm talking to Kayla about this creepy carpet cleaner guy that just came in here. He came in w/ his shirt off & he like has a shaved head & mustache & really shiny shoes. And he was like, ""Hey hun, I need to leave you a bill."" So he was writing it out & he was like, ""Ooh I guess I have to write the damn date huh? I don't even fucking remember it & I've already written it a million times today."" So he wrote the date down & freaking wrote yesterday's date. Smart guy. Then I had to show him where one of the rooms was & he was walking behind me & I felt REALLY uncomfortable. But oh well. Tetonia is a huge city, it's not like someone wouldn't save me if he hauled me into the room to try to rape me before hanging me from the shower head. Or taking me w/ him in the back of his huge truck.

I am cleaning out my purse because I decided to pluck my eyebrows since I'm bored. But I couldn't find my tweezers so I dumped my purse out. I have so much junk in my purse! I JUST FOUND MY TWEEZERS! Wow, I'm surprised, the last time the girls went through my purse I had over twenty tubes of lip gloss. Now I only have seven. I also have:
Dream Angels~ Heavenly lotion
Hempz lotion
Sunscreen
Clinique facial moisturizer
Matrix Sleek Look hair serum
L'oreal True Match foundation
A MINIATURE L'oreal True Match foundation also!
Clinique loose bronzing powder
A pill container full of Tylenol, Ibuprofen, & Pamprin (but Pamprin makes me sick so I'll never take it)
Cover Girl pink eyeshadow
Estee Lauder blush
A mirror
A nail file
Two packs of birth control pills
Midol
Hair clips
Cover Girl eyeliner
A really dumb keychain from some tanning lotion I bought the other day
Hahahaha, two Smirnoff bottle caps~ Watermelon & Green Apple, Watermelon is really good! But I HATE Smirnoff Ice
A lighter
TWEEZERS
Nail clippers
Tanning stickers
A miniature Tommy Girl roll on perfume
Victoria's Secret lip liner
    ""         ""   lip gloss (two of them, hahaha they're $10 each & the girls freaked on me for buying them)
Three ChapSticks~ Cherry, Spearmint, & ... the black kind (original?)
Lancome Juicy Tube~ Spring Fling
   ""    Juicy Rouge~ Apricot Fizz
MAC Lipglass~ Peacy Creme
A makeup brush
A key to our old Real Estate office
AND a Subway receipt that Jessica wrote CHELSEA on in really cool letters & I added Dawn to the end & we doodled all over it & it's really really cute. There's little *stars* & &hearts;hearts&hearts; all over it. And a chicken. And a penguin. But it looks like an owl sorta. Yup!

Now wasn't that just as interesting as can be?! That's how bored I am at work!

Should I go clean out my car...?!?! Haha jk. My car's funny though. I even have a box of tampons in there.

Ahhh! That was bad. I just realized that I had left all the stuff from my purse out on the desk & my boss had been in here. So that means the Smirnoff caps, lighter (even though it is for my makeup), birth control pills. djsg;lkjdsagh hahaha. Well that sucks. I hope she didn't really look too closely. When she came in there was a guy in here & she was telling him that she likes to come in & scare us when we're on the internet like we're going to be in trouble. And I told her I wasn't scared because I don't have anything better to do. She was like, ""What about that laundry?"" Well... I only have 2 1/2 to 3 hours left to finish it. I better go hurry!!

I'm not very pleased w/ the way I look today. Obviously the carpet cleaner man was though. I guess I'm going to go do laundry. I might post again... &hearts;"

Ray called me tonight on his way home for no reason at all. We hung out last night too. I was in town & he called seeing if I wanted to do something later. We drove around. Drank a little. He said we were going to the drive in, but then he drove right past it. Then we saw a huge elk that was running along side the truck. We stopped by Subway & he made fun of Celie & her Snail Trail. HAHAHAHAHA! (She was taking out the trash & it was leaking really bad & she drug it clear across Subway & clear across the parking lot.) Snail trail. Lol I don't think anyone will find that as funny as I did.

I finally called Ernie back yesterday too. He didn't answer & I was ready to choke him. I couldn't believe that he didn't answer my call after he kept calling me, begging me to answer my phone all night. Aaaaahahaha, I never thought I'd meet anyone named Jack! But then I called Ernie again later & he answered when I was prepared to leave him a really clever message. He knew I was so pissed, but we started getting along which made me mad. So then I made myself be mad at him again lol. And he laughed, because it was funny, yet it wasn't. He'll see how funny it is here in a few days when the girl he wants to be ""friends"" w/ hasn't called him. Then he'll see how easy it is to just be friends when he realizes she isn't calling. I'm stopping there.

Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, & Friday I was supposed to have off. I did have Tuesday off. Then my boss called me today & told me that one of the managers is in the hospital. Then I found out that the guy in the hopsital & his wife are going to move. So then I found out that we aren't going to run the business the same. And so I didn't get today off, & I won't get tomorrow off. I have to be at work at noon. And I got my paycheck today. $291. Not bad.

I'm still overdosing on Ibu, Vit C, & Complex B. I don't HAVE to take the B, but my gyno told me to. But she said I do need to take the Ibu & C. But if I were taking all the vitamins my dad has me take along w/ all these I AM taking... I'd be taking 20 pills a day. My dad has me take 10, but I never do. And the doctors having me take 10. That seems bad lol.

Today, I found KY Jelly in a room. I laughed my ass off. Pushed it around while I vaccumed because I didn't want to pick it up. And I finally got it w/ a tissue.

I went tanning today. My butt, thighs, boobs, belly, & back are fried. But for some stupid reason I always get stripes down my back, big ones. I don't understand. Parts of my body have a base tan already, but parts don't, so I'm wierd looking momentarily.

Tayson is so dumb. So dumb! He ruined his new cell, so he borrowed our sister's, & he lost it! dang'kadhg'dakghda';kgh;a I didn't mean to type dang.

I'm not typing anything too great, so I'm going to go. I'm getting sooo tired too. Kayla, did you notice I randomly typed all those guys' names throughout this entry?

Hahaha, that'd be so funny."

"event","I woke up at like 12 40 today. There was a note outside my door from my sister saying:
Chels,
   Ray called you from Nevy(something). You're supposed to call him back. I went to lunch w/ Terri, Rachel, & mom at the new Mexican Restaurant.
                                           Kerstyn
Well, I don't have any clue what Nevy(something) is, so I don't know how I'm going to call this Ray guy back. And the only Ray's I know are Ray Hansen & this really old guy that I've known my whole life that wouldn't even remember my name, let alone find a reason to call me. Plus, Ray Hansen would call my cell phone. I doubt he even knows my house number. And I had 2 missed calls when I woke up, but they weren't from Ray. One was from the Super 8... wow guys, it's only been 3 weeks since you called me. I thought I didn't have a job anymore. And honestly, I'd prefer it that way. And the other missed call was from Kerstyn's cell phone, but Tayson has her phone & he said he didn't call me. And yes, my phone is a piece of shit, so maybe Ray did try calling my cell but it didn't work. I DID call Ray last night really upset. And he DID say he'd talk to me later. But I really don't think it was him that called. I guess I should just call him & see rather than go on & on about all this shit. But anyway, I can't get a hold of my mom or sister to see about the phone call. My family has this thing w/ neglecting their cell phones. I might as well just quit answering whenever they call me to show them how aggravating it is. I mean I did that to Ernie last night. But not to show him how it feels when he doesn't answer. Although, I guess that might kind of show him how I feel about that too. New subject.

This song is too happy for me to even put up w/ right now. (Chris Cagle- What A Beautiful Day.)

I wish that I could call Jason. And he would come pick me up like he always use to. Drive around w/ me. We always listened to the best music. We got along perfectly. He was one of my best friends. He was always there for me. Things changed. I don't even have to explain why. But I sure as hell miss being that happy & not having to worry.

My mom told me on the phone last night that for the past year I've been put through a rollercoaster. She told me she feels really bad for me & everything I've been going through. She told me that she went through it too, but she was in her late twenties. Just like what Sheila told me about herself. I don't know how to handle it at only 17. I can't. All I do it cry. That's my fucking way of handling this bullshit. And if I'm feeling shitty enough I don't eat. And I do it on purpose. I can't talk about any of this w/o crying my heart out.

I hate myself so much. I love somebody else more than myself. I love somebody else more than my own dad. And somebody knows that, but doesn't return it.

I need someone to hang out w/. I didn't want to come home last night. I told my mom that. But I had to. I didn't want to drive by Ernie's late last night. But I did. I didn't want to avoid his phone calls all night. But for ONCE, I did. I've never done that before. I was just talking about this a few paragraphs ago & I said new subject. Now look at what I'm typing about again.

I told my mom I want to move last night.

I just remembered my doctor told me I need to be taking 6-9 Ibu a day & 2 Vit C & my normal pill. I haven't taken any yet. So I guess I'll go do that, on an empty stomach, & go try to make myself presentable. I don't know why. But I can't stay here all day."

"event","I am so incredibly, unbelievably uphappy w/ my body right now! Today I wore a skirt, flippies, & a white tank top. When I would see my reflection I wanted to like call a plastic surgion & get myself remade. There is this certain girl who is a year younger than me. She dresses pretty showy, & I personally don't think she looks very good. The main thing I notice w/ her is her stomach. I don't think she's quite small enough to show it as much as she does. And I'm never, ever happy w/ my body, especially my stomach, but I feel a little better off than this girl. Well, I FELT a little better off. I don't now. I felt just like her today when I would look at myself. Exactly like her! And I hate my legs. My knees suck. It's almost like I prefer to wear shorter skirts because then my legs don't look so bony because my thighs are NOT skinny. But the skirt I wore today was almost knee length & I felt like a freaking chicken. And I have my hair in ringlets today, so usually that makes me feel soo much better about my appearance, but today it didn't help at all. Ahhh aghla;hgdahdga!!! And there are a lot of other things that were really bothering me about myself today that I am not going to point out. But it was almost to the point where I wasn't even going to order dinner. I was really upset at the time anyway, so it was even more tempting to not eat. But I was starving, even ask Kayla. And if I don't start getting tanner I'm going to freak out. My legs like don't tan.

Jess & I talked forever tonight. She just barely signed off & it's almost 2. I really need to go to bed, but I don't feel like it. I have to wake up around 7ish too. Oh well, maybe if I stay up long enough I'll get dark circles under my eyes to add to all my stupid flaws! But anyway, Jessica & I had a really good conversation. I started crying during it, so that's not good, but not a surprise either. I always freaking cry! But then I ignore my gyno when she tells me things that might help w/ my emotions & stuff. I need like an anti-complaint pill. I complain all the time when I usually don't really have a good enough reason to be bitching.

I just stopped typing for a minute & started thinking. I was about to start typing that I need my pay check. See?!?! I bitch constantly! Ernie hates it & I don't blame him. And Ernie... I want to talk to him & see him so bad! If I don't get to see him tomorrow after work I'm going to want to like lock myself up in my room for the rest of the week because I'm not good enough for who I want to be out w/. I'M COMPLAINING AGAIN!

I need to call my doctor tomorrow. I need to find out what to do about these problems I'm having. These girly problems. I mean I'm paying for pills to make it so I won't have problems like this, & I still have them. So right now I'm paying for the pills & for the other stuff I need. That's crap! I'm going to go to bed before I bitch another word. I love this song!"

"event","I'm so confused!!! I'm sitting at work & the phone started ringing. That's normal. But it wasn't the phone. It was, but it's this wierd phone in the corner that I've never heard ring, ever, before. And I don't have any idea what it is. So I just let it ring & ring. And now I hear a bunch of voices outside the office, but nobody is coming inside. Just like I just said in the comment to Ashley, the doorknob keeps moving, but they never come in. And it's not locked. But I'm scared & I'm just going to sit back here freaked out by my surroundings.

And today! When I was leaving to go to work. I was going outside through the bottom. (Through our basement where I normally park.) And I open the door that leads to outside, & right there next to the dog feeder is a little skunk! Trapped! In a skunk trap thing. It wasn't very big, so it made me feel bad. And skunks, they can't spray when they are babies, & it wasn't a baby, but it might not have been able to smell yet. And I just hurried & shut the door & ran back upstairs to go out the other door. I wish they weren't such pains in the bum, because they're actually really cute lol.

Whoever fucking decided to try to get my deadjournal password is a moron! If you try to get my password sent to you through email, realize that IT WILL SEND THE MESSAGE TO MYYYYY EMAIL! gsld;kgjhadlkghealkjehawio So when I went to check my email this morning & it was telling me my own password, I wasn't very amused by your stupidity. And I guess you could try to hack into my email to get it, but that'd be just as difficult. Ooooh, I hate people!

I'm drinking Pepsi this early in the morning. And that's bad. But I need caffiene because freaking KAYLA kept me up talking til the crack of dawn. I didn't get to sleep til THREE! I was lying in bed from like 2 20 til 3 trying to get to sleep. Tayson came in my room at like 2 30 to steal the laptop & told me to quit thinking so I could fall asleep, but I couldn't. Anyway, I have a bunch of rooms to get done. So I'm going to go work on those for a bit before I give up & save the rest for Cassandra. I almost just said goodnight right here. I need sleeeeep!!! And a gigantuous hug from Ernie. Yes, that'd be wonderful. Okay, bye. Bye."

"event","So right now I'm sitting up in my bedroom in my little boyshorts. Not the ones I wrote about a few entries back, different ones. Haha, they say ""Ride a cowboy"" on the bum, & I love em! Lol, I wore them to the Big & Rich concert. Even if nobody saw them, I was being a kick ass fan. Wouldn't you say? I totally wanted to throw them up on stange, lol, but I needed them. And I like them too much! Enough about my panties...

I got home just a little bit ago. I was w/ Tayson, Mike, Bridger, Jed, Jeremy, Chase (he's so damn hot!), Amanda, & Dillon. It's Jed's birthday, so we were all hanging out for a bit before they all left, other than Chase & Amanda, to go to the drive in & the go camping. I couldn't go, obviously. I have to be up at 6 30 in the morning to be at work at 8 30.

When I was on my way home, Jed called me & asked me out on a date sometime. I couldn't say no, it is his birthday after all. Plus he's a nice guy, for the most part. And a casual date never hurts anyone. It's just hard to know what to say when everything is going on w/ Ernie & I. Guys just need to realize that I'm not ready to move on, so dates w/ me might not be everything they want.

I'm listening to one of my mixed CDs that I burned that have all the songs that remind me of Ernie & I. Right now Cowboys Like Us is playing, I really like this song. I can't get Ernie off my mind. I mean, I never can, but we had a really good conversation about an hour ago & I feel pretty good about things.

I hung out w/ Kyle for a long time today. Ernie knows it too. For a little bit we were parked at Broulims. His truck, which we were in, was parked next to my Durango. Ernie drove by w/ Brett heading towards Victor & I knew he saw us. And that's fine, but I knew he wouldn't be very happy about it. But then we saw Danny Little drive by too so Kyle figured there was a party or something. So he called Ernie, but Ernie didn't answer. I wasn't surprised. I was pretty sure he wouldn't. But then Ernie called me later when I wasn't w/ Kyle anymore. I told him I knew he was calling because he was mad & he said I was right. But he wasn't rude about it at all, which was really good. I really do think he's learning, slowly, but he is. But we talked for a while & things were said that I really think needed to be said. He kept telling me that he confronts me about Kyle consistently because he doesn't want me to get hurt. And he doesn't want me to get hurt because he cares about me. And he usually leaves it at that. But tonight he added, ""And I care about you because I like you."" And yeah, it would have been soo much more romantic for him to say he loves me, but he doesn't have to. I mean, it's usually obvious when someone loves somebody else. But even if you love someone, it technically doesn't mean you LIKE them too. And what kind of a relationship is it between two people if you love them, but you don't like them? I mean, I love my dad. How could I not? But I don't usually like him. I hope I'm making sense. He also said he repeats himself all the time about Kyle because he wants to be able to trust me whenever I am around Kyle. 
And I told him: ""You've always been able to trust me, even if you didn't think so for some reason."" (Because he can, I'd never hurt him like he hurt me.)
Ernie: ""I know I can trust you, except for that time that you did do stuff w/ Kyle.""
Me: ""I only did what I did because I was trying to help myself & move on.""
Ernie: ""He's not the right person to move onto, Chels.""
Me: ""I just didn't know how to act when I thought that things really were ending between us before, so I did what I did. I don't know what you want.""
Ernie: ""I don't know to think. I'm just... lost.""
Me: ""I just wish that if you do want to be w/ me still at all that you will be again.""
And the conversation went on for a while. I told him I knew better than to call Kyle. I told him I know that if Kyle wants anything to do w/ me than I need to let him come to me. And even then, we will only be friends. Even if he doesn't admit it exactly, he has feelings for Sorel. And that's fine. I don't have any problem w/ that because I still, & forever will have feelings for Ernie. But I also told Ernie that part of the reason I hung out w/ Kyle in the first place today was because I was mad at Ernie. (He told me that he figured the reason I was w/ Kyle today was because I was at Broulims & Kyle saw me there so he stopped to talk to me. But I told Ernie the truth.) And we talked about why I was mad. He told me that he used to try to keep things from me that would hurt me. He tried really hard, but now he told me that he is just going to tell me the truth about anything. It's just easier that way. But hopefully, he won't have to admit anything to me anymore. I hope he changes more & more. I love him so much.

Alan Jackson- Remember When just started on this CD. One time there was a small party at my house & Jessica was running music on my computer. She played this song & Ernie took me into our laundry room alone, shut the door, & danced w/ me while he held me.

Now Brad Paisley- Little Moments is playing. Haha, I remember one time when Bailey told me that something that happened between Ernie & I belonged in this song. I don't remember what it was though. And when I saw Brad in concert, Ernie was in Nevada. I called him when this song played & let him listen over the phone. It was like another one of those little moments when I'm so madly crazy about him that it's almost pathetic. But I like it that way. It's what makes all the hard times seem almost worth it. And hopefully one day, it will pay off & be 100% worth it.

Awww. Every song on this CD makes me tear up! Chris Cagle- Goodmorning Beautiful is playing. I was just about to type about how I'll never forget waking up one day & Ernie was sitting on the side of my bed holding a framed picture of the two of us cuddling that Bailey took. He was sitting here looking at it while I was sleeping. Then I woke up & he told me how much he likes that picture before he put it back on my shelf next to the now dried roses that he gave me on Valentine's Day.

'She couldn't keep from crying, when she told me goodbye...' Haha. Sorry for all my sappy stories! But this song, awww!! The other night when I finally told Ernie that I pout when I leave him at nights is because I absolutely hate saying goodbyes to him. That is why this song is on the CD. He tells me every night now, when we say goodnight, that it's hard for him to drive away from me because I'm so good at making him feel so bad for leaving me even if he didn't do anything wrong. I just &hearts; him & can't help but not want to let him go home lol. Awwww dkgh;lsdkhgs;lgkdhagl, I can't believe how crazy you can be over someone.

This is the last of them! I promise. Just to show that I realize Ernie has a past I'm happy for the good times he had w/ other girls before me. The song playing now actually doesn't remind me of Ernie & I at all, it reminds me of him & Amanda Rammel.

Aww, lol, tonight Jessica was at Broulims w/ Cole & some other people. She came walking over towards me & told me we should run to each other & give each other a big hug. Haha, it was so cute! I love you Jessica!

Bailey, I can't wait to see you tomorrow! My work day is going to go by so freakin slow because I'll be so anxious to hang out w/ ya! <3<3<3"

"event","I feel like shit! Like, this is so wierd. I can cry right now, & not even ruin my makeup! Because, I'm not wearing any. And that's wierd. But I just barely got out of the shower. So I'm sitting in my kitchen, freaking out over nothing, hardly dressed, all by myself! And that is probably good, that I'm alone. I mean all I have on is a skirt & my bra, nothing else. Well, except my hair is clipped up. Ahh! I can't believe myself. What if someone came up my driveway right now? Like a worker or something.

Yeah, so I decided to take a shot or two of my dad's rum. I actually took four. That was before I got in the shower. I don't know why I always sneak shots here. I'm surprised I haven't gotten busted. I'm sure in all I've dranken like at least a full gallon of his rum throughout all the times that I've done this. But that's the reason why I'm acting so ridiculously stupid. I mean, it feels good, lol, but I look like fuckin hell! I need to go get dressed, but I have no idea what to wear. Ahh!lds;hkgdsg

And Kayla, reading your comment you left me to my last entry made me want to cry like a little girl. I just barely read it, & ughh, I'm like the most emotional person ever. Oh my hell, I have like no feeling on some parts of my body, it's really wierd. I only had four freakin shots! But that's okay, right? I mean I'm sure almost every girl that's reading this right now is probably a light weight just like me. Right...? Anyway! This is still for Kayla. I don't look fine. At all. What so ever. Thanks, but I hate myself. I need to go get dressed! But I won't feel satisfied w/ anything I put on unless my makeup & hair are done, & they aren't. I wish someone was drunk here w/ me! Yeah, you're right about dads. They really need to lay off. I feel so incredibly awkward about what you said about Ernie & I... It made me happy to read what you wrote about him & I. It made me REALLY happy. Yet, a bit confused. But, I don't know, like you understand. And I like that. And I really hope that things go well w/ you & Jeremy. It seems like you're really happy to have him like you do. That's awesome.

I guess Kyle's not mad at me like I thought he might be. I hung out w/ him yesterday. I was w/ Mike, Britt, & Tayson. But then Mike got mad at Tayson so he left, & took Britt w/ him. Then Tayson left. So I was cleaning out my car at my parent's office. I guess Kyle drove bye & saw me, so he called me. I went to talk to him at Kwik Way. Before I even got the chance, Ernie pulled up next to me at Kwik Way. So I was talking to Ernie, & then Kyle came & got in Ernie's truck. So that was really really awkward. But Ernie had to go to a meeting so I hung out w/ Kyle for a bit. We went to eat at Subway & drove around for a while. Then he had to go work for an hour. He said he'd call me to hang out when he was done. So I called Ernie because I knew Ernie wouldn't approve of that. He freaked on me saying he couldn't even believe I'd consider that. He told me to tell Kyle that I was going to be at Ernie's house. But I told Ernie I wouldn't say that, because I didn't want to lie. And he was like, ""You're not lying, I want you to come over."" So that was kinda lame. But I did go to his house. And we just like worked on his bike. I'M NOT HIS FUCKING BITCH EITHER. That was for whoever said I'm his bitch when I'm w/ him while he's working. I don't do anything he tells me to do if I don't want to. He rarely tells me to do anything. And when I do help, it's because I want to. I was there til from 8 30 til about 10 30 though. I don't understand him & I... He doesn't use me like people think he does. He tries to stay away from ANYTHING that would make it seem that way. Even more than I stay away from anything that might make it seem that way to people that don't really know. But we just sat in his driveway & held each other forever. It's just... different, since we're not officially together. Ahh, everything is so confusing.

Bailey-- Are you coming here tomorrow?? You should let me know what's going on ASAP.

Kayla-- UPDATE!

I'm going to go do my makeup & stuff now. I feel extremely unattractice & useless. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;"

"event","My dad is a freaking psycho! At 10 50 tonight I'm in Driggs w/ Jeremy & Mike. I told them I was going to go before I got in trouble. (My mom & sis are in California so I'm stuck under my dad's complete control.) They tell me to just stay longer. So we're out driving around & my dad calls. He's like, ""Where are you? What are you doing? When are you going to be home?"" I told him I'd be home soon & that apparently wasn't good enough for him. He made me tell him EXACTLY when I'd be coming home, I didn't know so he said to be home at 11 20. By this time it was 11 15. I was like, ""Kay, well since it's only 5 minutes til then I'll drive really fast."" (Thinking he'd realize his stupidity & back off.) Nope, he said, ""Good, I'll see you here in 5."" Ahhhhhhhhlakdgh;khgakgdh;ladkhga. Then like 3 minutes later he called again telling me he was waiting. So now I'm like hiding out in my room. He's in bed now, but I can't stand it when my mom's not around. I can't handle that man!

I brought Ernie dinner out to his shop tonight around 6. I was probably there w/ him til about 9 30. He keeps telling me that he really likes it when I come out there & hang out w/ him while he works. So although it's sometimes boring, I go out there for him pretty often. It's better than being home at least. We have been getting along really well lately. But there's just this thing about saying goodbye. Like when we are both going to head home for the night I hate to say bye. I hate it so much! Like if you've ever heard the beginning of that country song, Party Crowd. I don't remember who sings it right now... But that's how I feel. After I went past Hatch's Corner heading back to Driggs he called me asking why I was driving so fast. I always drive fast, but he said he noticed how far ahead I was & wanted to make sure I wasn't mad or whatever. So I just explained & didn't carry the conversation on, it wasn't necessary to do that.

I guess Kyle's back in town right now. I saw his car today, but not him. But Mike said that he actually saw Kyle. Anyway, my point is, he's not making it very obvious to me that he's back for some reason. I'm thinking he might be mad. ?? Like we were hanging out quite a bit like last week. Then the night before he left town for work he invited me over. I told him I wasn't sure if I could make it because I was w/ Celie at the time. But I told him I'd call later to let him know. He didn't answer so I left a message. He never called me back since then. It's not a huge deal or anything, I just don't understand. I mean Ernie & I talked about Kyle & I, but I don't think Ernie told Kyle about any of it. I'm sure he didn't. Oh well...

My stupid medications for my foot caused side effects!! I'm so mad! The doctor told me the one thing they might effect, & of course it had to happen. I don't think any guys read this, & I guess if they do that's their own fault & they can handle it. But it screwed up my period. That stresses me out! Like I'm on birth control pills to regulate my period. I have been since October because my doctor that did my tonsil surgery said it would be a good idea. So now I've started taking them as to where I'll only get my period 4 times a year. But the medicine for my foot screwed it up & I'm mad. Haha total overshare. Sorry, yet I'm not because I don't see why anyone would care too much. I'm really glad I'm a girl, but that makes it difficult at times!! I'm sure at least one of you agrees.

I need to start doing sit ups. Sometimes I'll look at my reflection in windows or something walking down the street & I'm so flippin disgusted! That & I really should be using my tread mill more often. Ughh I hate myself!

Oh, but I called my womanly doctor about my problems. She was looking through my files & said she noticed what brand of pills I'm on & told me these pills make girls really overly emotional. I told my mom that & she acted so relieved that we know what is so wrong w/ my emotions now. But I know myself that the pills aren't causing all my unhappiness. But my doctor prescribed some sort of pills that are supposed to help w/ stress. They aren't antidepressants though. So I don't know. That & all these other pills for my body. Ahh. I'm going to turn into a druggie. I'm done w/ my foot STEROIDS now though. Thank goodness lol. Those doctors are damn lucky nothing happened to my body. Like as in I didn't turn all manly. I'd sue them in a heartbeat, seriously. I wish my mom wasn't gone... I don't like my dad. I'm going to go now. Talk to Kayla for a bit & go to sleep. Night &hearts;"

"event","I'm still so psyched about my hair! I really like it. I always knew I didn't like having too dark of hair. But for a long time my hair was just so damaged that I figured it'd be best. Then I got used to it & seemed to be okay w/ it. I was even scared to highlight it & now I don't even know why.

I guess I'm just kinda happy w/ myself right now. Well, I'm not at all. I mean I have all the flaws that I'll NEVER point out. Hundreds of them! But some of those I'll never really be able to fix permanently unless I get really rich lol. But in the mean time I'm just somewhat satisfied. I don't mean to sound stuck up though. This morning on my way to work I was on the phone w/ my mom & I was crying because I was so unhappy w/ myself at the moment. But ya know how sometimes you just have a day when you feel like you actually can be seen in public? Yeah. I think today ended up okay because I got new clothes to go along w/ my new hair. Plus I'm getting a little color finally & people are actually pointing it out. It is pretty nice to hear that when you are a brunette w/ very fair skin & freckles.

So yeah, I went shopping yesterday. Minnesota will be way better than IF, but it was nice. I went w/ Ashley, Jess, & Celie. It was such a nice day! My mom gave me some cash because she insisted that I get a new white bra. And of course, I don't have a problem w/ that. But I bought almost everything w/ my own money. I just couldn't afford a bra by myself recently. (I'm picky about them.) I'll only wear them from Victoria's Secret. At least as far as I know. It's not like I haven't tried them from like The Bon or JC Penny or even Wal Mart. I have. I just don't feel comfortable enough. Haha, I've never seen anyone else talk about their bras in their journal. That's okay though. So I got a new one at VS. I can't believe my bra size. I knew I was grown out of my old ones, so I moved up. I'm a 36C now. Not a full C, which is the largest I hope I ever get. My mom is mad about it, haha, jealous. I also got a pair of panties there, boy shorts. They're so damn cute! Ernie always thought my boy shorts were cute. They're so comfy, you can just like hang out in them! But I only have a few pairs so I got another. They're black & have little bright pink bows on the sides. And then forever I've been wanting a Dream Angels Heavenly perfume set from VS. So I got some spray & the lotion.

Everytime the girls & I go to the mall we go to Vanity & stock up on panties lol. Not that my stock ever runs dry or anything lol, I just love them. I think all four of us got 3 pairs each yesterday. I really like the ones I picked out!

There are only like 3 pairs of pants that I own that I actually like to wear. The rest just sit on the floor. And one of the 3 is white, so I can't wear them as often as others. So I went to The Buckle to look for more. I'll only wear Silvers so that makes it way more difficult than it needs to be. But I found a really cute pair that I bought. They were pretty expensive, but I called my mom & she said it was worth it.

I went to Wal Mart for socks but came out w/ face wash, foundation, a disposable camera (digitals suck sometimes), & ponytail holders. No socks. I forgot them.

Then I went to Barnes & Nobles to get my new book that came out that I read. And two magazines. It was a needed shopping day. We had to be back to the valley by 5 for Celie to go to work. But then I had plans again at 7 anyway, so I had time to get cleaned up. Ray asked me out on a double date w/ him, Jason, & uhhh, Teresa from Blackfoot. I felt really bad because I am not really comfortably able to be that great of a date right now. I'm not used to other guys. But I had a good time last night anyway. And Ray said he did too. And Jason & I got along for the most part. We went to IF & went to dinner at Texas Roadhouse. Then we went to, I don't know the name exactly. NazCart? We went & raced until our movie, The Longest Yard, started at 10 30. Think about that. I have a midnight curfew. Yeah... I got home at 2 haha. But my parents knew, plus Jason talked to my dad on the phone because ""my dad loves him so much!"" Jason & Ray always say I could stay out all night w/ them & all this other crap. They're too sure of themselves.

My foot's starting to get better. My mom made me go to the doctor on Thursday. They put me on steroids. It scared the hell out of me to be prescribed freaking steroids! But I asked 3 different doctors if it was 100% okay for me to take them w/o side effects. They said it is because it's only short time or some shit. They better hope so. I'm sure it'll be fine. It's not antibiotic steroids, which actually would cause problems, so yeah. And while I was waiting for the doctor FOREVER, Tayson came in w/ a hurt finger. He thought he broke it at work, but they said they aren't going to x ray it yet. Eww, the sickest thing happened. When my foot was worse than it is now, if I stepped down too hard I could feel the infection move in my foot. Hahaha, it's so gross! It felt like jello, aghida;lgkdahgladk sick!

Thursday after I went to the doctor, I went to Kwik Way to get a drink. Ernie pulled up & we talked for a minute. Then I called him about something we were joking about & we got into this really deep conversation about Kyle & all this other stuff. I ended up crying & he was mad lecturing me. I asked if I could go out to his shop so we could talk in person & he freaked out saying he was leaving. Then after a while he told me I am spoiled rotten & I cut him off, called him an asshole, & hung up the phone. I never thought I'd do that to him. I was at Subway w/ the girls when this all happened & they were busy. So I was just sitting outside on the sidewalk talking to Mike on the phone & crying. Then I looked up & Ernie pulled into the parking lot next to me. He told me he came to apologize, then he did apologize. I didn't. I sat in his truck w/ him for about a half hour. We ended up joking around & being okay. He told me that when we hung out earlier in the week he had a lot of fun w/ me when we just didn't discuss any problems. He asked me not to talk to Kyle as much. So I agreed but told him I'm sick of not having anyone there for me or anyone to make me happy like I had been w/ him. He said he is sick of not being happy too. And he told me that whenever I need someone there for me, he wants it to be him that I go to. He said that when I need to call someone to talk, he wants me to call him, etc. And he finally admitted that during work he talks to Ben about me. Sometimes he has such a wonderful side to him that he shows. When he went to leave he asked me for a hug like he always does now. Doesn't seem like much, but it is. It's relieving to hold each other for a while. I love him. 

I get out of here in 50 minutes. I have a little inventory to do. And I have to put a few things in the reservation book. But I think that's all. And Cassandra gets here soon. My mom just called & told me I can order the bikini I want! I'm going to go eat lunch now... at 4 10 haha. I have to eat w/ my pills. Bye! <333"

"event","I'm hurt yall! Haha. I'm in a pretty freakin good mood too! I don't know why. I guess it's because I had a really desperately needed conversation w/ Sheila today. It upset me, of course, but she's such an awesome woman. Like, she started the whole conversation & right when I started to tear up she'd tell me how she understood & immediately grabbed a box of tissues. Like the conversation got really deep. She even told me she was surprised she was talking to me about everything she was. She told me she doesn't want to watch me go through what I am for the rest of my life. It wasn't all about Ernie & I, it was things she'd gone through also & how she can relate so exact. It felt so incredibly good to be that understood for once though. I mean some people understand really pretty well, but it's her son, she knew exactly. She'd practically read my mind & tell me how I have been feeling, & she was completely right. She told me that if she could do anything at all to make things better & make up for his mistakes or change him, she'd do it in a heart beat. But she doesn't know how. But we talked forever, then once Celie got there the subject kinda got changed. I was there for five flippin hours haha, it was sweet. Celie was bored out of her mind, but I was pretty relaxed.

Anyway, I didn't even tell how I'm hurt even though that's how I started the paragraph. But I love my hair! I made it lighter & I really like it a lot. Plus she spent over an hour just working on my split ends. Again she told me how my hair takes longer than anyone elses. At least she doesn't have to do it everyday!!! But I also got it trimmed & thinned a little bit. Now Kyle & Ray CAN'T say my hair is black anymore. It was once, but it's not now, that's just not me. But Bailey you really doo look good! Haha, look how I spelt do. I've gotten some really nice compliments though, which is cool. So thanks everyone!

But yeah, I hurt my left ankle pretty bad. It's retarded though, because I really don't even know how it happened or what's wrong. Like what happened in Europe last summer w/ both my ankles, it's like that again. Yesterday at work I was fine. Then after work I went to Subway to see all the girls & Ernie drove by, honked, waved, called me. I went out to his shop & I was putting burn gel on my feet & legs when I noticed how my left ankle was swelling. He could tell too. Then when we left Kyle wanted to hang out for a while. By the time I went to leave I showed him & he said it was really gross. Haha, it was rude, but true. Then I went to go home & couldn't even stand how bad it hurt. I called my mom pretty upset & she offered to have Tayson come drive me home, but I just bucked up. Then she came out & helped me in the house because it got so bad. I was cryin like a little girl haha. So I popped 3 ibuprofen, propped up w/ 3 pillows, & went to sleep.

When I woke up this morning it wasn't nearly as bad. Then my dad had me go help him hook up our hottub for a bit. He had me running up & down the stairs & stuff so it really started hurting. Then we got in a huge huge fight. He was so incredibly rude to me I couldn't even believe it. The things that came out of his mouth are not things that a father is supposed to say to his daughter. It was so bad. I called my mom & told him & she told me to just leave & get ready at my brother's, but I just got ready here before my hair appointment. By the time I got to Sheila's my ankle was horrible. It's just gotten worse. Before I came home my flippies got to the point where they were cutting off circulation a little & my foot was falling asleep. Some lady in Sheila's Salon said she couldn't believe I didn't go to the doctor. I just don't want to make that big of a deal about it. I mean that's one of my biggest things is that I don't want people to think I'm trying to get attention when I'm not. Luckily I don't have to work Thursday, Friday, & Tuesday like I was supposed to. Just Saturday, Sunday, & Monday. I probably won't be of much help.

I'm going on & on. I'm going to go listen to Black Eyed Peas & clean my room up a little. Nighty night!"

"event","I've been really upset lately. More upset than I've been in a long long time. At least since Ernie & I broke up. I've had my hard times ever since, of course, but lately has just been hell. It's not just over him or whatever, it's a few things. It must be things I'm not even aware of also because for the emotions I've been going through, it just doesn't make enough sense. Today was better than the past few days, which is definately good because I've been so bad that it's been like crying almost every hour of every day. I'm not trying to get sympathy or make people feel bad for me, I'm just expressing how I feel.

I'm happy w/ how today/tonight went for the most part. I mean there are definately things I would have changed, but things don't always go how you want. So you have to take life as it comes. I got to sleep in until about 12 30 today, I really needed that little bit of extra sleep. I went to Driggs around 4 & got a call from Kyle asking if I wanted to go swimming at Packsaddle Lake. He has his friend, Sam, up visiting from Bozeman. We didn't find enough people to go so a bunch of the guys just ended up going on a ride while I went & hung out w/ the girls. Kyle knew I was kinda upset that they asked me to hang out & then had a change of plans, but he promised he'd call right when they got off their ride. He pulled me aside before they left to talk to me. It wasn't really the fact that they found something else to do that upset me, it was something else. Problems w/ a friend that I used to be really close to. Anyway, I talked to Kyle again at about 9 45 & he told me to drive down to his house. I was there w/ him, his parents, Sam, & Jared for a while. Then Sam, Kyle, & I left & went to a party up Cold Springs. There were a few people I really didn't like up there. But most of the guys that were there I get along w/ really well.

But really, rather than just going on about details of the night, my point is that I'm thankful Kyle was there for me. And Sam is really cool too. He's 17, & he was just really nice & easy to talk to. We got talking about Ernie when Ernie showed up at the party. And Sam was just there, talking, listening, being what everyone needs in a friend. We didn't just talk about me, we talked a lot about a bunch of different things. He knew I didn't like most, if any, of the girls at the party, & him not knowing them made it easy for us to just blow everyone else off & talk. Plus the whole time Kyle & I were sharing Apple Smirnoff, just like at my birthday party. It's like tradition now. &hearts; He's such an awesome friend.

I talked to Ray, Scott, Billy, Brett, & everyone a bit. I love all the guys so much. I love how we can just joke together & have fun. Ernie didn't show up til about 10 minutes before I had to leave. I was talking to a Ray & Sam when Kyle said something like, ""Hey beautiful, do you want me to take you to your car?"" So when I went over to talk to him & get ready to leave Ernie gave me a hug. He's sick so I asked him how he's feeling. We didn't really have much time to talk, but sometimes it's better that way. I hope he gets feeling better. I love you, baby!

When Kyle took me down to where my car was parked he brought up how a lot of people think badly of me when they shouldn't. He told me that when he told his family I was coming over tonight that his mom mentioned how she heard that I'm a slut. He was really nice about it thought & told her I'm really not. He told her she should take the truth from him rather than lies from other people who don't really know me. And he does know me. He was just telling me about how it pisses him off about how people judge me wrongly. It made me so happy to hear how he cares though. Seriously, if you know me, you know that one of my hardest issues in life is how people see me wrongly & how much it bothers me. Kyle even asked me to call him when I got home to make sure I drove safely. So when I called I thanked him for everything even though I felt cheesy. 

But just w/ everything I've been going through, all the shit, Kyle made me really really happy tonight. Happy enough that just typing about it has me in tears. And crying right now is something I've kept myself from doing for the past few hours. I honestly don't know what is wrong w/ me, causing me to go through this. I feel like a baby, but I literally, honest to God can't help it. It's gotten to the point lately where I have even cried to my dad, & he's the last person I would ever be crushed enough to resort to. We just don't have that type of relationship.

Anyway, I don't want to sound sappy. Kyle & Sam both asked me what I'm doing tomorrow night. Kyle said he'd give me a call, so hopefully we can go out & have fun again.

I'm not going to say exactly why, but I lost a lot of respect for Jeff tonight. He was w/ someone that I really don't care for at all. For the first probably 20 minutes that I was at the party I didn't even know he was there. Then he climbs out of a car w/ his shirt off. He went over to talk to Scott, Brett, & someone else. It was a bitchy thing for me to do, but I walked over to them & told him straight up that I lost a ton of respect for him tonight. Scott burst out laughing & was bending over like he was going to roll around on the ground. All the guys thought it was pretty funny, yet I just thought it was really helarious how they reacted to what I said. I love parties haha. Normally I'd feel bad for what I said, but I don't. The girl's a bitch. Jeff deserved it, at least in my mind. And obviously at least a little in Scott's mind too. Then Jeff got this idea to go on a ""road rampage"" w/ the girl. They fucking drove 10 yards away & parked. So a couple of the guys later went to ""rock the car"" & bother them & I guess broke off either her license plate or part of her bumper or something. Lol, tonight was really amusing. And around this same time Danny Little decided to try to walk the fire. Jason was at the party so the fire was huge. Danny made it 2 steps & fell in it. This is right after they told me not to get near the fire because the log they put in in was seriously covered in huge ants.

Tonight Scott asked me why I never call him. Like he doesn't have my number. But maybe I will more often. He's pretty cool, & I need to keep myself occupied.

Since I've been partying a little, I'm at the point where I could clearly go on & on all night. But I'm going to stop myself & go because I have to work tomorrow morning at 8 30. Goodnight. Sorry I wrote so much, yet I'm also not sorry. I don't care."

I'm going to go clean the only TWO rooms that need cleaned today. I've been here, at work in Tetonia, since 8 30 & I've still got 5 hours left! And I just got invited out to Palasades to party w/ my brothers, Mandy, whoever I could bring, & whoever else is out there. Usually people like Ben Beard. But I have to be at work FOREVER! dg;lakghal;kegh;aeli I'll probably post again later because I'll be so bored. Bye! &hearts; x1,000,000,000,000,000"

"event","I love the way he talks to me. I hate the way he jokes, but I love the way he tells me he only says the things he says to see how much I care. I love that he can hear me complain about being sick & react in such a cute way as he did. I love his voice, his eyes, his arms, his walk, his smile, his scent, his style, his trucks, everything. I can't get over it, I &hearts; him to pieces.

We just had another really cute conversation. His sister called on the other line so I'm waiting for him to call me back. In the mean time I'm going to go take a bubble bath. Being sick all day, I never got a shower in. Just a lot of precious sleep. I can't believe how much I've written in here today. I've been so bored..."

"event","I woke up w/ the flu this morning. I feel like fucking SHIT! Well, I'm doing okay right now because I finally took a nap about an hour ago. But I was throwing up all morning. And Andrew stayed the night at my house last night. So since Tayson's room is right next to the bathroom & they were sleeping I felt bad. But I threw up three times. And I just weighed myself, because losing weight is the only good part about being sick. But I didn't lose a single pound! I hope I don't throw up anymore though because it's not worth losing weight. Plus I can lose weight in other ways. I mean I have my own treadmill here at home that I got for Christmas a few years ago. But anyway, I'm really hungry. My mom & sister are supposed to be bringing me some Powerade & crackers home soon. We have crackers here, but I want different ones lol. I'm being spoiled I know, but it's okay because I'm sick. Plus they offered to do it. Until then I'm home alone dying & they don't even care. Sniff sniff. I'm lucky it's my day off.
Oh, my boss in Tetonia just hired Cassandra McKinny to work w/ me. I don't really know her at all though. I don't even know what grade she's going into. But I think she's pretty cute & takes care of herself pretty well.
And last night I had a good night. Well, it was sorta boring, but I had a couple really good phone conversations. I was hanging out w/ all the girls & Cole at Subway. Cole is such a sweet guy, but he's Jessica's man. Plus I don't even want him. (It's Kyle M.'s cousin.) But he's really nice even though he calls me Bitter Butt. He says he wants to have his friends from Utah come up because he can tell I need someone to treat me like a princess. But I just want that treatment from Ernie most, & Cole knows that.
Ernie & I talked on the phone a couple times last night. And I'm happy because they were like really happy conversations. No bad parts at all. I love how we can laugh w/ eachother & just be completely different together. Rather than thinking the other person is wierd, it's just so loving & funny. And then there are those times when we talk that he can say something & it fits so perfectly into my &hearts; at that moment even if it's not that big of a deal. Like last night I told him, ""I'm really pissed Ernie! We haven't hung out for a while & I just feel really used! We haven't hung out since Sunday! I just feel like a used..."" He was like, ""Whore? Yeah, I know, I thought of that too. But you know you aren't a whore at all. And I can tell you that you aren't used at all either. You really aren't."" It made me feel really good inside!
But I'm going to go get myself a popsicle. And I think my mom is pulling up the driveway! AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING OUR HOTTUB SOON! LIKE ANY DAY!"

"event","Oh my gosh that scared the hell out of me! I was just sitting here at my kitchen table on our laptop. Well, I still am. But anyway, I got this text message but it didn't have a number or name of who it was from. The first one said, ""you have a nice face--"". I was like, oh how sweet, I can't reply but that was nice. Then I get another thinking they are telling me who they are. No. It said, ""oh yah ill pinch ur elbows all night long--"". Yeha, so that's definately out of the ordinary. I'm sitting here talking to Celie & this guy about it & they are laughing. Then I get a third that said, ""i see u, u have a nice laptop--"". ;dlgakdhgdla I honest to goodness teared up. It scared me so bad. I'm in the corner of the kitchen so I'm next to two windows. I thought someone was going to break through a window & kill me. So I told the two people I'm talking to that I really hope it's one of them & if it is to tell me immediately. Celie was like, ""Yeah, I thought you would be getting really scared after that one, it was me."" Then she text messaged me again saying she loves me. I never really update on here, but I'm bored.

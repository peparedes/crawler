Things in my life are going at a steady pace...
Busy, yes but steady

I did the View on Wednesday...then later that night taped Last Call with Carson
I think they told me it will air on the 13th...not sure

This is the run around part of a new album...
for me a new album, a new show & just getting completely back into this world
It's almost kinda strange

I dunno...
After the whole Irrestible fiasco
I needed the break & the time
To get in tune with Jessica..

Through all the ups & downs it took
I feel like <b>I <i>Know</i> who <u>I</u> am now</b>
Which is Comforting

I miss my friends
Whenever my busy-ness curbs & I get downtime
I spend it with Ashton, who's about as busy as me, so we take what we can get
Don't get me wrong....the boy is a Dream <3
But I Miss my friends...Alot

It just sucks in the sense that No Matter what I'm basically Missing <u>SOMEONE</u>


Ah well....
I'll survive...

I'm gonna go paint my toes...and hang out with my good friend Danielle Steel =)"

I really am a fucking Brat
It's kinda funny....

I on impulse cut my hair right before the VMA's...
I think I like it
It's different

Ashton is sleeping on my couch & he looks so Beautiful I just stood there looking at him for a good few minutes, he was exhausted *smiles*

I Miss Love.....it's been forever since Iv'e been able to spend time with her....We talked briefly at the VMA's...but nothing like we NEED....Being without your best friend for so long is terrible....

My Mama & Daddy are coming to stay with me in like 2 weeks....
So Ashton really really gets to meet them..
He met Mama briefly back when I did the eps of That 70's Show...but that barely counts, even though Mama did tell me he was cute ;)

*yawns*

Well...I guess there'd be no harm in snuggling up on the couch with him
I could use some rest myself"

"event","You know it's sad that even in a time of true & utter happiness you can still be haunted by the ""demons"" if you will of your past....

<small>The bumps & bruises, they go away
<i>appearance wise</i></small>

Maybe it will always haunt me....
but I'm the one that comes out on top
either way I win
<b>I'm the better person</b>

Anyways....enough nonsense

Iv'e been in Iowa with Ashton for the last 3 days...we're staying one more night, then it's off to NYC for the VMA's

Suprisingly I'm in <b>Love</b> with this place...
It's so cozy & <u>Ashton's Mama is a Queen</u>, I haven't slept this well in forever...nor have I ate this well *laughs* I don't have to put on any show.....or be perfect

I really think I'd live here if I could

I could live in some of the moments Iv'e had here forever I know that
Who would have thought...it was possible to Love again
or maybe I didn't REALLY Love before?

I think that this might be <b><small>REAL</b>
<strike>but I don't wanna jinx it </strike></small>


Iv'e also found out that Mr.Johnny Depp is a very brilliant man
You should <b>ALL</b> buy him Cheesecake


The ""Demons"" may always haunt me
but evil doesn't win...
as long as you don't let it

My album coming out has really done me good...

I was so exhausted & so run down....I cried alot
I missed my Friends & I missed Ashton
I was stuck alot of places with Nick
I cried alot
I was a nervous wreck

but Monday night...I sat down & I listened to it all the way through
and I cried again...but it was a good cry
I remembered how in Love I am with these songs
And how proud I am of myself

Even if no one were to buy it....
And it totally flopped

It's Diamond to me
And that's what matters

I'm proud of myself
I feel GOOD about myself


Dammit, & I'm going to enjoy this"

"event","My life right now....is finally becoming balanced, in some way

Ashton is wonderful, truly he is, Sometimes I forget that he's real 
After the things Iv'e went through I didn't think I could let a man in ever again & feel safe, or comfortable

But I feel those things with him, plus a million other things
He wants me, and everything that comes with me...which is baggage that would make any typical guy head for the hills....I tried to make him run away, but he wouldn't
He's also not typical, not like you'd imagine

I didn't think I was ready for a relationship.....but I'm ready for it, if it's with him

<small>In some small way though, I feel like I'm doing something wrong by being with him because I know it bothers someone I Love, no matter what she says, but I also know that she knows in her heart how much I Love her....and I know she wants me to be happy</small>

And I am, at this very moment I can say that I'm Happy....
Mostly thanks to him

Tommorrow, well technically today considering the time I'm posting this... my Chelle is coming by for lunch!! And I'm Pumped! It's been so long since we've got to spend any time together, we have so much to catch up on, & I just can't wait to see her!!! <3

Then Tuesday I'm flying to Toronto early to Catch Chrissy & Justin's show! I'm pumped about that too....I know it'll be great! And I can't wait to see my Xie, cuz it's been to long since I saw her Hot Ass too! I don't care if I have to take another red eye flight home THAT same night...I'm going *smiles*

I finally got a chance to talk to Love too which was nice, it was really comforting to hear her voice, and to get to tell her I Loved her..I really miss her
And I also have 2 tickets to Ireland she got me for my birthday that will be used soon to go see her...we need some quality sisterly time!!

I just really feel like I'm becoming Human again
Jessie again
I feel like I'm alive, instead of dying
and I like this much better"

I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off for the last 2 weeks
or I feel like I have at least...

I feel run down...all I wanna do is sleep

I had a quick radio interview yesterday & could barely keep my eyes open
I hope I did an ok job of trying to be the smiling, happy, alive Jessie I'm supposed to be

I wonder when I sleep though, if I'm actually getting sleep..
Cuz I don't feel like I am..
I feel like so much is going on in my head

I'm merely resting...."

Iv'e been pretty busy lately

Lotsa Radio interviews & parties & signings & stuff like that

*smiles*
I'm enjoying it though, it's keeping me busy & keeping my mind focused on just one thing

Nice to meet up with alot of people I haven't really seen in awhile & meeting up with fans is always good for me

I can't wait for Ashton to get back
I miss his company
And I need to talk

Not that Love & Britty & Mandy & Liv & Chelle & so on... aren't availiable if I need them

But there's a difference between male companionship & female companionship..ya know?

*shrugs* I dunno
I'm rambling..."

I'm not sure if this is the best time to come around. Things are hectic around here and I'm just trying to get things back into focus before the single drops. 

I will try to slip onto AIM tonight and chit chat, there are a few people I need to catch up with. I haven't spoken with Love or Brittany in ages, and I need them right now. I need everyone right now.

Wow, look at me rambling *smiles* I apologize. My AIM is JessaXXSimpson Hope to talk to y'all soon.

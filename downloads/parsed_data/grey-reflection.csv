The other day, I went to talk to Big Brother about the dream/vision/voices...that I heard in my head the other night. Well, because I couldn't remember much about what I saw, he used Cerebro to try and dig it out of my head. As I focused to try and remember everything that I saw, I suddenly found myself seeing the scene and feeling bad for these people. This woman was holding a small child that looked hungry and sick and I felt like there was something I should do to help. But...I'm not suppose to be thinking like that. It was wrong. So very wrong. Those people are traitors to the government and they should be punished. I should be feeling what I am. 

But, somehow, I can't help it. It used to be the people we arrested were rebels, outlaws, true dangers to Big Brother's ideas. But, more and more it seems that we arresting civilans who are just trying to survive and it seems to me, that perhaps we could be helping more than we are. 

But, I shouldn't be thinking that. These people are just as dangerous as the anyone else. They are a threat and they must be punished for their traitorous ways...

I'm so confused..."

Charles, 
I don't know if you heard it too, but last night I was awoken from my sleep by some interesting thoughts. I couldn't quite place where they were coming from, but, it was defintily a woman. <strike>She sounded a lot like me, actually.</strike> I'll focus a little harder and see if I can pick up more. I'll keep you posted.

Scott, 
I just wanted to appologies. I didn't mean to wake you up last night. I got a little starlted by something I heard, but no need to worry.  I'm going to try and disucss what I hear with Charles. You should probably come too. 

Come to my place after work tonight and I'll make dinner and...make things up to you. ;)

"event","So, the other night, Scott and I were having dinner together, and he asked me to move in with him. I told him I had to think about it. I'm just not sure that that's such a good idea. I mean, I love him. I do, with all my heart. But, I don't know that moveing in together is a smart thing to do. I mean, I realize that Big Brother sort of looks the other way when it comes to us, but somehow, I think this might be pushing it. I suppose we could always talk to him, but it seems silly to bother him with this since there are much bigger things to worry about it. 

I don't know. I'll just have to think about it some more. In the mean time, Scott will have to be content sleeping at my place or me at his. But, maybe...him asking me to move in with him is a step closer to him asking me to marry him? Hmmm...there's a lot. But for all the mind reading I can do, I will never understand the workings of the male mind. It's a vortex of things and functioning I just don't understand. And long have Scott and I be together? Sheesh!"

"event","Hiya, haven't posted lately, but married life is good, at least to the girl I got. Your experience may vary.
We haven't really been on a proper honeymoon yet but I'll keep people updated.

I know we did have plans to the over and see east coast people, but sickness was had right after the wedding, not cool.
We will be out there soon to see you peoples.

We had a pinata and rock band at the reception. Nothing like getting pictures of an elegant bride smashing things and doing deth metal scream holding a guitar.
&nbsp;
I got live attenuated swine flu virus sprayed up my nose today. No exactly yay, but better than a shot. And judging from the people at work that have already gotten h1n1, much better than the ass kicking that gives you.

They attenuated the nasal virus so it can't live at human body temp, only nose temp. I'll keep ya updated."

(be productive you damn tetris &amp; puzzle fighter people!)<br /><br />Most of you have heard of protein folding, a bunch of computers networking, working on bunching up long ass strands on protein to see how they work.<br /><br />Well, some people think blind computer math can learn something from puzzle gamers.<br /><br />You generally just move stuff around to someplace you think it will fit, and the computer does the fine tuning work. You are given a score that is actually the stability of the protein strand.<br /><br />They take it easy on all the technical stuff, and give most everything cutesy names. You just squish a strand together as tight as you can, without things getting red because they are too close, try to put most of the orange thingies on the inside, and make glowy ladders with the sheet things. <br /><br />So instead of what this protein is (tl;dr):<br /><font size=""1"" color=""#c0c0c0"">Fyn is a membrane-associated, non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase approximately 59kDa, which belongs to the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Fyn is very strongly similar to mouse Fyn, v-yes and c-src. Fyn is expressed predominately in tissues of neuronal and hematopoietic origin. Neuronal Fyn and hematopoietic Fyn differ at the junction of the SH2 and kinase domains due to tissue specific alternative splicing. Fyn has been shown to be involved in B cell and T cell activation as well as keratinocyte differentiation. In T cells, Fyn associates with the T-cell antigen receptor and Thy1.<br /><br />The unique N terminal domain of Fyn interacts with the CD3 and eta chains of the TcR. Fyn can bind to other proteins (p82 and p116) through its SH2 and SH3 domains, which may act as substrates or regulators of Fyn activity. Fyn is highly expressed in brain suggesting that it may have a role in the sensory nervous network and in myelination at early stages of CNS formation.</font><br /><br />You get:<br /><b><i>Oooh I fit da peices togeder and got da ultimate high score!.... wait...

Just bought a shall we say an oldie but goodie projector, time for movie madness! It's an older one, not exactly 720p, but it is much higher rez than a regular TV, and plays arcade emu games just fine. Also it dosen't use $300 modern bulbs, just $5 ones (the main reason for getting this model)

Price? $61 Ebay. Not bad for a 74"" TV! (at my current 9' away)
If anyone is interested, models are:
CTX 550, EZPRO 550, Proxima lb30, Dukane lb30 Lightware vp880. All the same thing.

I'm currently projector crazy, I'm planning on later working on ripping up a LCD monitor and slapping a few lenses around it and putting a 400 watt metal halide bulb at one end and making my own 720p projector, good use for my rusty electronics skills and a good excuse to have friends over.

(Heck my current City of Heroes character is named after a projector bulb, and is glowy and hot)

I'm also baking bread from scratch.... O_O; Huh? 
Just got this book, ""Artisan bread in five minutes a day"". The general idea is ya mix up dough, let it sit out some period of time, put it in the firdge. Then just rip off a hunk when you want, slap it on a table for a bit, then toss it in the oven, fresh bread. Has worked pretty good so far."

It's time to start going to smaller cons. When they get too big, they go sour.

Didn't get much done at the con, Pretty much everything was impossible to get into, and for the first time, I wasn't even allowed to even peek INTO the dance, due to so many people. If they have addmission to the con, they should just plain limit attendees if they can't fit enough people into damn near anything.

Had fun with everyone tho, just thinking the badge itself wasn't that worth it.

So anyway, I will limit my bitching and state that I will look forward to some smaller cons like youma, reactor and such (dunno how big they are, need to do research & find more possibilities.)

Got shopping to do? Good. 

Step 1: Go to target. 
Step 2: Find some stuff to buy, about $30-$50 dolla worth.
Step 3: Go to the music section, find the gift cards, they are red $50 cards, they cost $50, and they are FRIGGIN MP3 PLAYERS!
Step 4: Pay for the $50 gift card that is a friggin MP3 player!
Step 5: Get out of line, go back in the store, get your stuff you wanted, pay for it with the card.
Step 6: ???
Step 7: Profit!
Step 8: Thank me for your free 64 meg usb MP3 player.

Even if you have a MP3 player, this is great because you don't care if you lose it. Hell, give it to somebody, heh.

To answer an unasked question, yes I read your LJ if you are reading this. Now, I'll get on with the stoic geek part of the post.

Things I'm obsessed with right now:
Allegiance
Multiplayer online first person strategy space combat flight sim, with RTS elements. Microsoft put this out a few years ago, pay to play, but now it's free (they released the source code?? M$? wow) and fan run. Games usually last 20-60 mins and you just join a team/side each game. A commander builds bases & typical RTS stuff, and gives commands to a bunch of other ships that are all players. Teamwork is big, really nice to see in a game nowadays.

If you somewhat like space filght sims, but really like complex strat, and don't mind a big learning curve, this game might be for you.

Community is good, they have several nice training programs to help new people play better, and the most secure servers I have ever seen. Also nice beacuse it's not all about blowing things up. Placeing probes so the enemy can't sneak up on you is a huge deal.

Pretty videos of it:
Well made promo, nice music 
<lj-embed id=""2"" /> 

Techno & combat, nice scene of an Aleph Resonator bomb going off 0:34
(Nukes the whole area around both sides of an Aleph(stargate/blackhole thingy) So much for the other team camping waiting for you to come thru >:D Boom.
http://www.german-borg.de/files/AVP1_256k.wmv

Lots of Shootin' (Other games in this video also, start watching at 1:34)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVNM4fWPFPA

Lots of combat, shows tactical maps and action going on.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ__4qWLO7E&mode=related&search=

Scene of a kill & target trying to boost away from a missile.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qveSd0q8ne4&mode=related&search=

Allegiance, Discovery Channel style:
http://hosted.filefront.com/LawsonVideos
Guy is trying to make pro looking info vids, too bad he messes up in the vids ""The pilot here again makes a fatal error...."" (him, heh) nice narrator voice tho

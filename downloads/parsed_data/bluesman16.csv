"event","Well we won the battle its a nice feeling but is by no means a success I mean we won a battle of the bands in Salt Lake City against some punk bands and one other truelly genuine musical act.  But it was a good time.  We had a lot of friends there but I missed missy so bad! I wanted her there big time and she couldn't be it sucked but the gig was a blast! the crowd was into it and we grooved hard.  We had a ton of support from all our friends including my live journal buddy jesse

She is such an incredible writer I hear music as soon as I read her words thats really cool.

"event","okay so Friday i went to abacoa w/Lenora and Joey. Basically hung out w/lenora everyday. and then monday did the same thing except w/katelin and lenora. Went to singer Island. Swam there and stuff. Didnt check in so now im grounded. and i we were planning to go to the rapids today. and i cant go but they went anyway. and idk for some rason im mad. idk if im supposed to be mad or w/e but i am. i mean if one of them got grounded then i would wait to go. cuz i told them i would get off in a week. So if i knew that they would get off in a week i would wait till they go off. But no0o0o0o they cant wait for me. i am so fricken mad. i hate them s0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o much right now. and then lenora lies to me. 0o grand. and guys just to let u know katelin said ""okay lets say she can go"" she said thats what u guys said. but HELLO if i could g0o u didnt tell me the plans...and u had them all planned out s0o obvisouly that quote thing up there isnt the truth. bcuz u dindt tell me the plans u guys were making and i thought u were saying i could go. Hmm nice bull shit. and idc if u invite someone else...but then u fuckin lie to me about it lenora. Both of u i could give a fuck less about right now. Like go to hell. =Yes harsh and im probably making things worse....but thats how i feel. s0o yeah! =]"

We were tlaking about STUFF w/each other. I really relate to these girls. I &lt;3 them. It was so fun talking to them. intersting things. So after all that we ate fruit w/chocolate. Score! and then we changed into our pj's, and went into the huge ass tent we were gunna sleep in. We had cable in it and watched Men In Black 2. During it we talked some more and we danced and OTHER STUFF. Mwhahahahaha. Lol. Only we know what happened. OKay so then we were like rolling over each other. haha it was fun. and then everyone had to go pee so bad and it was hot. Except brittni bcuz she went to sleep in the wicked beginning. So then we all pee'd and laid in her bed. So g0od! So then we moved in there. dont worry i asked brittni if she wanted to come and she said no. then when-ever she came in and was on the excess stuff we didnt use. We went to bed a 6 maybe later. But when we were up we worte down sum things put it in a paper ball then we read it uesssed who it was then talked about it. It was fun.

The dance was yesterday night and it was awesome! okay well we didnt go in a limo...bcuz it could only fit 6 ppl! and the driver wasnt even supposed to come to Lenoras house. but thats okay we made lenoras moms van the limo it was P_i_M_p!(suckers) and so it was awesome!!! Jp and his friends were like staring @ Brittnis ass  while she was dancing haha funny stuff and then mark was too and u could tell he wanted to dance w/her and he did and he pulled her on him...eeewwww...and Aaron was there mwhaha i dont like him as much but i kinda do. idk its confusing. but the dance was grand. Sara learned how to dance from Candi Brittney and Me...It was funny bcuz Brittney was dancing w/Devin and then she somehow got Sara and Devin to dance..Fast Dance...also sara ASKED derek is he wanted to dance and he said no and then she was all sad n shit and then she SLAPPED him!!! Candi said he started to tear and then when they were leaving he said bye bitch..i wouldve slapped him again!!! it was all good. Dude it was s0o0o0o0o0o much fun!!!!! and then they played vitamin c(as we grow on we  remember...) EVERYONE cried. Blake, Angie , Lenora, Brittni, Brittney, Aly, Me...EVERYONE!!!!!! it was so sad! and me and blake were like y did u have to play that fucking song. but we were shouting it and then he was making fun of everyone...dick...and devin was telling angie not to cry and then he came up to me and wiped my eyes and said u need to stop crying too. He's really sweet.So that was that. Then when we were leaving these to vaginas were moving the revolving door the wrong way and brittni goes move the other way and when they got out he's like shut- up ugly and i was like excuse me and she said excuse me and then he said u heard me and i was like u better watch your mouth u dusche bag. I wouldve walked up to them and said more but he looked like the type of jerk to hit a girl!!! LOSER!!! And she really isnt ugly so he needs to shut-up bcuz he was uggly and that was probably the only thing he could think of 2 say! Then the PARTY 2 lenoras house was awesome!!! omg!! I cant even explain!!! Then i spent all 2day w/her. Pretty awesome. Well i'll tell about the after party andtoday l8r i dont feel like typing nemore...so im out bitches. l8r"

"event","Oh boy. Im home guys. I was offically transfered to 2 hospitals. I left a little early as i needed alot more care for myself and i could not get the medical attention at the place i was at. I am scared to be home but so happy to see everyone, especially my wonderful husband who i missed every second of the day.. I am doing a little better. I am now following a meal plan and am doing my best to eat the food on my plate  My health is a little better as i have some more energy. My weight is still the same but i will learn slowly to gain a bit at a time. The programme was really good as far as eating disorder programmes go, however my BDD/OCD was far to distracting for me to benefit soley from it. I am now seeking further care outside of it and am continuing to do all that i can to continue to fight. I cannot thank my friends who took the time to write and send me adorable gifts. Every single letter made me well up, every package brightened my day. I got countless letters that i wish i could reply to all, please pm if you sent one so i can put name to package! I cannot express my thankyou's in writing..I am so blessed to have you all in my life. Its people like you who help me keep my head held high..You are my angels.. I missed all my customers so much and i am excited to be back and working (not toooo hard though!) and bringing you cute designer bits and bobs! Missed you all terribly.. Thankyou again and again. My recovery is that much easier because of each and every one of you. I will not let this beat me. I will fight so hard over and over for every bit of life it stole from me i will live twice as full  Love you all millions.. All my love, zee xo"

"event","<font size=""2"">As of tommorow, saturday March 10th, i will be heading to a hospital in LA to continue my long road to recovery from my anorexia nervosa. I will be away for a minimum of 2 months. <br />This is the most scary, frightening, challenging and hardest things i have ever had to put myself through and i am doing it to learn the truth to my life..Learn how to wake up with a smile and let go of those demons that control me. 11 years now and i have forgotten to live life as it was meant. Each day has become just another day to fight, and now i just want to win.. I need to nurture my body, which has taken top much abuse with no rational. I have the most amazing team behind me, including my wonderful parents, friends and my husband, who i have sworn saved my life by finding me.. I could not do this without their love and support. I am really really scared. I am so afraid i feel sick to my stomach. My life has been about punishment and denial, fear and self hatred. I just want to love myself for the honesty and compassion i love others for. With the energy i continue to look for and will hopefully soon find, i want to say thankyou to my creator, and my life, and all the wonderful people and things i have been blessed with, by giving back and offering myself as best as i can be. Its my time, and i am putting on the boxing gloves, ready to fight those demons that make me starve and punish myself. Noone can control my life as best as i, and now its time to prove it. I love you all so much. I thank my customers for being so sweet and caring. I thank the honesty and compassion of my friends online. I will be back soon and selling you more beautiful clothes. Thankyou from the everything inside me.. xo</font>"

"event","I had a moment. I was going through my old photos and decided to copy the photos over that made me remember the times I have really enjoyed.  The people I have adored who have moved on, living back home or have left the world :( Everyone I have met in my life has had an impact on me and taught me so much about themselves and about myself. I have never regretted any friendships, experiences.. just accepted them as a part of what I needed to grow and become me. My friends have made me. My memories remind me how lucky I have been. How happy I can be. My memories are what makes me wake up in the morning ready to open my eyes and open new doors to people and opportunities. Experiences are memories. memories are experiences. Every single one so powerful in an array of emotions. Learning to feel. Growing up. Becoming..  Knowing I had the blessing of experiencing new, weird and the uncomfortable.  Meeting people, Experiencing your nature and now embracing the memories that no one can take away from me.<br>
<br>
I am finally becoming strong enough to let go of the past that tortured me, and smile at the past that became me.

"event","About 3 years ago i did a piece of artwork at college..the theme was disorders..  I decided after keeping a secret for many years about my ana/mia to put it on canvas..   It was my way of telling the world without actually telling them..  It was so weird doing it and pouring every ounce of my own truth/pain/reality into my art and having everyone look at it.  I was chosen to exhibit it and i declined.  I was told if i didnt exhibit it i'd lose a grade.. I didnt care.  I couldnt handle the idea of people critizing it or telling me what they didnt think i captured or how wrong i was or even how right i was about the reflection of the disorder upon my work..  Can you imagine how that would have felt?  Anyway.  This is what i came up with...    On the canvas there is a picture of food.  The words on that image is actually a real extract from my diary..      It couldnt get any more real than that...

Got to stay in the four seasons for free for 3 nights because she works at the one here in san diego. This hotel is a feckin' joke! We turned up with no makeup, hair in a messy bun, pajamas and no socks half asleep and incapable of conversation! The bellboys smiled politely. 
I was right in the centre where union square is, the mall, nordies rack, marshalls, ross, h&m!! urban outfitters, lohemans! many many more! BUT i didnt get too many pics because 80% of people we walked by where sketchy or begging and i didnt feel so safe.. So here ya go a few snapshots from my lil holiday! :)

"event","Me and Rhawnie Flew to hawaii a few weeks ago! Im terrible at taking photos because i forget my camera when im hungover.     I forgot it a lot this holiday..   :D  Hawaii is a dream come true.  One of the best places ive been so far! We got a GREAT hotel for only $69.99 a night and it was 1 min from the beach.  We were right in the middle of town with shops, bars, clubs and restaurants! It was gorgeously hot and the ocean was crystal blue!  Getting there we had to take a flight to salt lake first!  I was treated like absolute shite at the airport because they thought i had drugs in my bag.. Turns out rhawnies bag had smelt like weed cuz shes had weed in it before.  After about an hour of humiliation and degrading behaviour towards me they gave me the bag and said i was free to go.  I looked at the dude and said that that was not my bag, my bag was the white one and he flipped out on me saying how i lied about which bag was mine..       WTF?!  I said he didnt even ask me which bag was mine and that i was just thrown around from security guard to another, but he kept on saying never to lie again! I was soo hurt and mad!  Turns out rhawnie got away scot free and im the poor sod who gets felt up, questioned and humiliated!  On the way home from the trip they thought i had drugs in my flipflops because they are made with some sort of metallic fabric and it sparked off the detector! I had to sit down and be felt up all over again!  Anyhoo!  Trip was fantastic and i miss it sooo much!! :) xo

"event","John Cleese's Letter to the USA 

To the citizens of the United States of America, in light of your failure to elect a competent President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today. 

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II resumes monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories. Except Utah, which she does not fancy. 

Your new prime minister (The Right Honourable Tony Blair, MP for the 97.8% of you who have, until now, been unaware there's a world outside your borders) will appoint a Minister for America. Congress and the Senate are disbanded. A questionnaire circulated next year will determine whether any of you noticed. 

To aid your transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect: 

1. Look up ""revocation"" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Check ""aluminium"" in the pronunciation guide. You will be amazed at just how wrongly you pronounce it. The letter 'U' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour'. Likewise you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters. Generally, you should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up ""vocabulary."" 

Using the same twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as ""like"" and ""you know"" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication. Look up ""interspersed."" There will be no more 'bleeps' in the Jerry Springer show. If you're not old enough to cope with bad language then you should not have chat shows. 

2. There is no such thing as ""U.S. English."" We'll let Microsoft know on your behalf. The Microsoft spell-checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u'. 

3. You should learn to distinguish English and Australian accents. It really isn't that hard. English accents are not limited to cockney, upper-class twit or Mancunian (Daphne in Frasier). Scottish dramas such as 'Taggart' will no longer be broadcast with subtitles.You must learn that there is no such place as Devonshire in England. The name of the county is ""Devon."" If you persist in calling it Devonshire, all American States will become ""shires"" e.g. Texasshire Floridashire, Louisianashire. 

4. You should relearn your original national anthem, ""God Save The Queen"", but only after fully carrying out task 1. 

5. You should stop playing American ""football."" There's only one kind of football. What you call American ""football"" is not a very good game. The 2.1% of you aware there is a world outside your borders may have noticed no one else plays ""American"" football. You should instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. 

Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American ""football"", but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like nancies). 

You should stop playing baseball. It's not reasonable to host an event called the 'World Series' for a game which is not played outside of America. Instead of baseball, you will be allowed to play a girls' game called ""rounders,"" which is baseball without fancy team stripe, oversized gloves, collector cards or hotdogs. 

6. You will no longer be allowed to own or carry guns, or anything more dangerous in public than a vegetable peeler. Because you are not sensible enough to handle potentially dangerous items, you need a permit to carry a vegetable peeler. 

7. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 2nd will be a new national holiday. It will be called ""Indecisive Day."" 

8. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we mean. All road intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left. At the same time, you will go metric without the benefit of conversion tables. Roundabouts and metrication will help you understand the British sense of humour. 

9. Learn to make real chips. Those things you call French fries are not real chips. Fries aren't French, they're Belgian though 97.8% of you (including the guy who discovered fries while in Europe) are not aware of a country called Belgium. Potato chips are properly called ""crisps."" Real chips are thick cut and fried in animal fat. The traditional accompaniment to chips is beer which should be served warm and flat. 

10. The cold tasteless stuff you call beer is actually lager. Only proper British Bitter will be referred to as ""beer."" Substances once known as ""American Beer"" will henceforth be referred to as ""Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine,"" except for the product of the American Budweiser company which will be called ""Weak Near-Frozen Gnat's Urine."" This will allow true Budweiser (as manufactured for the last 1000 years in Pilsen, Czech Republic) to be sold without risk of confusion. 

11. The UK will harmonise petrol prices (or ""Gasoline,"" as you will be permitted to keep calling it) for those of the former USA, adopting UK petrol prices (roughly $6/US gallon, get used to it). 

12. Learn to resolve personal issues without guns, lawyers or therapists. That you need many lawyers and therapists shows you're not adult enough to be independent. If you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist, you're not grown up enough to handle a gun. 

13. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy. 

14. Tax collectors from Her Majesty's Government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all revenues due (backdated to 1776). 

Thank you for your co-operation. 

* John Cleese 
[Basil Fawlty, Fawlty Towers, Torquay, Devon, England]"

I wouldnt stop until i scratched the back of my throat.  I always knew if i got a swollen throat by the end of the week i was doing a good job of starving...  Every so often when i get moments like this one i want to throw up, but i never have food in my stomach at the time and im not one to eat food in order too... And here i am thinking i eat too much and feel fatter everyday.  I feel soo huge.  I feel like im overweight.  I feel like im drenched in disgusting fat.  I feel like im going back to my old weight.. Oh god i couldnt..i cant even imagine....  UH i just hate the way i feel and i feel it way to often.  Im so dangerous at these times.  I feel destructive.  Like i want nothing more then to put my body through hell.  Im laying in bed on this friday night at 9pm because i didnt want to go out and be 'seen'.  I still havent quite figured out why.. I guess i look at it through my eyes and i dont wanna see me, so why would anyone else?  Perhaps that is my problem..  Oh get me out of this horrible place inside my head.  Im so sick to death of it."

I feel like i cant control anything at the moment and being so afraid of losing control i am taking it out on myself in relapse.  Right now i have a very strong intention to lose 10 pounds as soon as i can just to place myself in [what feels like] control.  I know this would put me at a weight that would be 'technically' to low, but to me, at this moment, nothing is to low.
I dont lose weight fast anymore.  It used to drop off me..on and on until i reached a horrible plateu of 115 to 118 on a daily basis.  Today i was almost 120 and i couldnt stop crying.. To be governed by a number is irrational.  I am fully aware i am irrational. I wish people would stop trying to make me realise this.  I am so hungry.  I need to eat.  I am TERRIFIED to eat.  I want to avoid food for weeks.  I know i cant.  I know i cant go out without food and that cuts out my social life, which i also need.     Im stuck in a rut.  I need some guidance.  I need some help.  I need somebody to hold me up and tell me what to do and to eat and when and how much.  I need to learn how to lose weight the right way, before i learn that being small does not make me any less of a victim.  I make myself the victim, not the number on the scale.  I am very confused.  I want to scream.  I want to cry.  I want to eat."

He described how he stabbed his mom to death and when asked why, he started to cry lots and mumbled between cries, 'because she would never lve me-she just never loved me..'  it was so sad..  I cried a lot. I think, for me, the love i have from my parents has kept me alive  I am very other directed and i survive solely on the love of others.  [a problem that i need to work on] If i was cut off emotionally from those i love the most- i wouldnt wake in the monring. I feel torn because i know im empathetic but i also know the act itself is selfish, but for some reason, i can completely understand the desperation to fight a situation/explode emotionally.

Friends who dont care where we end up hanging out because its the company that drives us to hang out.      I have been here 2 years and cannot think of a single friend who has been consistant. I crave the stability of others.  The positiveness.  The loyal, trusting, open armed friendship that i dream of day in day out...  Friends who are as into me as i am, them.  I will never be able to change the way i view others.  I will always love you way more then i should to start with.  And i will always be dissapointed.

"event","Hyponatremia (related to ""water-loading"") - as stated above, electrolytes are essential to proper body functioning. Drinking too much water (more than eight, eight-ounce glasses in less than twelve hours), can cause Hyponatremia (not enough sodium in the blood), especially in someone already malnurished or dehydrated. Hyponatremia can cause fluid in the lungs, the brain to swell, nauseousness, vomiting, confusion and even death. 

And there i was thinking drinking 7 bottles of 'propel' a day was a great, encouraging idea to hydrate myself because i found it impossible to drink just plain water.

"event","ok, so as a follow up from the latest loss of our wonderful doggy, joey, i have seen what servere loss looks like and feels like. When i say servere, i say it because i have never seen such distress in the eyes of my family before and i never want to see it again.  I guess what i am trying to say is i have started to put more value on my life.  I've seen what loss can do to the people i love the most.  The people i actually continue with my recovery for, solely.   I think i've now put a higher value on my own life.  I dont want to make them worry anymore than they already do.  Death is so final and real.  I think holding him in my arms and staring death in its eyes has made me wake up. 
And right now, after doing my usual, nuts,coffee and diet coke excuse for a diet i am very shaky and my blood pressure is high [obviously] and im more scared then i've ever been about my health.  I hope this is a good sign.  I am taking a lot of vitamins and I just nervously drank straight from my bathroom tap to calm the dizzyness.  Joey, you opened my eyes and my baby i'll miss you, whereever you are.

Last night marlo dragged me to the bar and i spent most the night sleeping on her shoulder ;)  Today i have not moved from this couch and every 3 hours i wake up and check my ebay and snoop livejournal.  My dad thinks my electrolytes are out of sync - but i know he is paranoid.  I have not thrown up in a week now and so i know thats not to blame.  I have spent the last 3 weeks eating nuts and fish to give myself protein, but in exchange i have restricted other foods.  I think my mind is playing tricks on me.  I've been cheeky by mixing brekkie and lunch together so i infact, only eat one meal between the two and for dinner i usually claim to have 'eaten all day and im to anxious to eat dinner' but i know deep down that it is not true.  Its strange to be in control but then, be so out of control..  I've had half a cup of porridge with splenda, a salad with some pine nuts in it and a 20 kcal lolly and a handful of grapes and apparently thats completely justifying my reasoning behind not eating dinner tonite.  I know its crazy.  I know it, but why if i know it am i still convinced?  It is so strange to have two opposing opinions stored right next to eachother.  Oh, nevermind, im sleepy again.."

the best of you?

the summer of enlightenment is officially underway.  i have read so many books already and i see even more reading.  monday i finished this book called ""speak"".  it is about this young girl starting high school who is afraid to talk because she was raped at a party over the summer.  i enjoyed this book so much that i just couldn't put it down once i started reading it.  it made me feel like a freshmen again, which was kinda scary  to live over again.  i think my students would love to read this book because it seems so real...like a problem that some of them could identify with.  i am thinking about recommending it to be added to our reading list.

i finished reading ""the teacher's funeral"" on monday night.  i laughed so hard throughout most of the book.  it is set in 1904, in the great plains.  the main character of the book feels an array of emotions as his teacher dies and is replaced by his sister.  the ordeals that the boy and his family go through during the story are totally believable and typical of farming families of the period.  in fact, the story, characters, and language remind me of my hometown.  it was a great book, and i have even recommended it to my dad.

i just finished ""catcher in the rye"".  shooo...i really don't know what to say.  there were times when i wanted to throw the book against the wall and say to hell with it, but i kept reading.  i am glad i did.  when holden dropped the record that he bought for his little sister phoebe, i cried.  i mean, i made a list of stuff from this book that confused/bothered/intrigued me.  for starters, why does he use so much profanity?  i mean, it is gd this and gd that, every few words.  the rest i can deal with, but i just couldn't get adjusted to the swearing against God.  even phoebe yells at him for it.  another thing...he is obsessed with sex, and has several chances to ball several chicks and wusses out each time.  he is such a kid...and he is always looking for company.  he wants someone to drink with him every few pages...even though he is just 16.  the part in the book where he describes the guy who falls out of the window and dies while wearing his turtleneck just chilled me.  what killed me most was the whole, ""she kills me"" thing.  lol  everyone ""kills"" holden.  and the fact that i had to read practically the whole book just to figure out what the title means is just...i can't even describe it.  honestly, though, i am glad i read it.  there were times when i wanted to strangle holden, and times when i cried for him.  that is what makes a good book; something that can inspire a vast number of emotions in the reader.

on that note, i will leave this critical analysis behind and get some rest.  but first, some reading...""grapes of wrath"" is calling my name, beckoning me forward."

"event","i saw stars, falling all around your head
when we were young...
where have you gone?

mom's birthday was wednesday.  she is now 52.  she doesn't seem that old, not that 52 is old...it's just she is my mom, ya know?  she is never going to be ""old"" to me.  i can't tell a difference in her appearance in years.  to me, she is still the mom who stopped and straightened my hat at kindergarten graduation...the mom who listened as i mc'ed seventh grade graduation...the mom who watched me address my class at senior graduation...the mom who cried as i walked off the stage with my college diploma.  she just got a little more grey around the ears each time around, is all.

the past few birthdays have been different for mom and me.  she has been more distant.  since my oldest brother died 5 years ago, mom hasn't been her usual self.  she is more withdrawn, more alone than ever before...and i feel so powerless to help her.  this year though, i think i gave her a great gift, and it didn't cost me a thing.  this gift wasn't wrapped in shiny paper or a fancy gift bag.  

don't think me cheap or uncaring.  i did get her a great, expensive present.  i know she liked it...well, loved it.  when i was on vacation last month i bought her an aigner purse and tickets to see her favorite singer, george jones, this summer.  of course she liked those things.  

now here is the back story...

ever since my brother died, my mom has looked for things that give her a sign that he is ok and in heaven with my grandparents.  on the first Christmas eve since his passing, mom walked out on the porch and saw a line of three stars in the sky.  she believed that these three stars were my brother and grandparents in heaven, letting her know that they were together.  sure, this is romantic and childlike, but that is my mother's innocence...pure and unyielding.  

of course, i never had the heart to tell her that what she was seeing was part of the big dipper, which has been around a whole lot longer than all of us combined, but i always rolled my eyes when she talked about it.  i knew that she wasn't seeing anything that people all over the world hadn't seen a thousand times over, and i didn't want to help her participate in a deluded fantasy that held no truth.

back to wednesday...

after we had sang our birthday songs and filled our faces with cake and ice cream, it was time for me to go home.  i walked up to my truck in the dark and something caught my eye from above.  i stopped on the driveway and gazed into the sky for several minutes, just allowing the sight to fill me to the brim.  

i got into my truck and drove home quickly, hoping cloud cover would not shield what i had seen.  i called mom as soon as i got through my door, before removing my shoes.  when she picked up the phone, i said, ""go outside and look up in the sky, straight over the big pine tree at the end of the yard.""

i heard her open the screen door and step onto the flagstone porch.  it seemed to take her forever to speak to me again, but i could hear her breathing on the other end of the line, along with the occasional sniffle.

""there's my stars,"" she said, her voice cracking.

""yup.  they're out tonight, mom.  they knew it was your birthday and they came out just for you.""  

i couldn't see her, but i knew she was crying.  i heard her yell for my dad to come out onto the porch and look at the sky.  i could hear them talking, but i paid no attention to their words.  i just knew that this was the best birthday present my mom could hope for, and even if i knew the truth about the big dipper, it wasn't that whole constellation of stars that made mom happy.  it was her straight line of three that did the job.

no...mom doesn't seem 52 to me.  she is still filled with childlike wonder and amazement at something as commonplace as stars in the night sky.  

i pray that when i am 52, i will be more childlike.

i pray that when i am 52, i will be more like mom."

i had sooo much fun yesterday!

i bought a new cell phone from alltel, finally.  i had been wanting a new one, since mine was practically an antique.  i think john smith had one like mine when he came over to start jamestown back in 1607.  the new one is great.  i can't believe i paid as much for it as i did, but i think it will be worth it.  i have worn  the thing out in just the 24 hours that i have had it.  i can take pictures, video, browse the web, and a few other things that i haven't figured out yet.  love it!

i really wanted to go see constantine this weekend.  it was playing friday and saturday night as a special midnight showing.  i tried all week to reach tyler, who is my fav. movie going compadre, but i couldn't get through on his cell phone.  last night at 9:30 i decided to try once more and i finally got him.  he was on his way home from work, and i told him i wanted to go see a movie.  he came on over and we went to grundy.

when we got to the theater we got to see a couple making out in the stairwell.  i thought tyler would gag!  we bought our tickets and i practically walked into ashley r.  she had brought a friend to see the movie too, so we all sat together.  one of my kids from school who works at the theater was there to see it as well, so he joined us.  we all had a really fun time, just talking and catching up.  

the movie...

one word:  superb!

i was kinda worried at the beginning because i didn't think i would like it after the first 5 minutes.  here i had wanted to see this movie for so long and then i started having doubts after the first guy on screen gets plowed into by a car after finding the spear of destiny.  but...when he walks away from the pile of twisted metal unscathed, i put all my worries behind me.  however, they returned again when i saw this little girl get possessed by a demon.  when keanu appeared on screen i didn't care what ugly beast or bloody gore was shown.  he is so sexy!

great movie!  i actually cried near the end.  when constantine is denied the opportunity to go to heaven, i felt a tear or two roll down my cheeks.  i suppose the most moving part was when constantine called upon God to help him defeat lucifer.  and i loved how gabriel was punished for blasphemy by being turned into a human.  oh, bittersweet irony! of course, on the way home i had to explain that to tyler, but...i am used to that!  lol

we stopped for food at huddle house and finally got home near 4.   it was such a lovely time!  :P

on that note, i am gone to see if the easter bunny left anything good for me under my pillow.  wait...that's the tooth fairy!  dude, i need sleep!"

and i wanna show you...show you all the things that this life has in store for you
i'll always love you...

from the first time i heard this song i knew it was meant for my ears.  sometimes i play it over and over again, just replacing the name of the girl in the song with my niece's name.  

sweet katie jane

i love that kid.  if ever there was an angel, it would have to be her.  not only is she cute and sweet, and juicy, as my mom would say, but she is remarkably smart for her age.  she is only 2 and already she can count to 10 and sing the abc song and pretty much anything she hears and likes.  katie captivates people from the first time they lay eyes on her, which is amazing for such a small kid.  she reminds me of galatea from bicentennial man...she has personality.  

when i see her, i think about this song because there are so many things that i want to be there to see her experience.  i have been so lucky to watch her grow so much these past two years.  i wonder what she will look like when she gets older, how her personality will be, if she will like the same kindsa things that i like, if we will have anything in common when she gets old enough to understand that i am her aunt.  all sorts of things run through my head when i think of her as a 10 year old.  will she play sports or music?  will she be a bookworm?  will she be a beauty queen or a rebel child?  i can see so many things in her already that are waiting to burst free from her, and already i am afraid i will miss something really important.  

sometimes, when we dance in the living room, we listen to this song and i sing it to her.  she falls asleep on my shoulder as we glide across the carpet, and i wonder if life could ever get more perfect than this: being part of a special child's life from its beginning.

nothing could top that feeling at all.

is it possible to drown in the sound of someone's voice?  yes, no doubt.  i have suffocated myself on the sound of a voice so many times that i could feel the vibrating waves engulfing me on all sides...slowly devouring me.

found this band a few weeks back...one of my uber sweet students recommended matchbook romance to me, and since we have such similar musical tastes, i had to check them out.  thanks rachel!  great song.

i took my braids out last night.  the result was a head full of kinky, fuzzy, crimped hair.  i received rave reviews for it today...everyone really liked it.  amazing what a week of braided hair can do for a gal, huh?

i have a dentist's appt. tomorrow.  i am kinda dreading it, even though i really like this new dentist.  he went to u of l, which makes him a god among men in my book!  :P

i can't always just forget her
but she could try

at the end of the world
or the last thing i see
you are
never coming home
never coming home
could i? should i?
and all the things that you never ever told me
and all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me...

yup...new favorite song.  i really enjoy my chemical romance.  i was just searching through lyrics a few days ago and stumbled upon this song.  when i read the lyrics, i thought they were great.  but when i heard the song, with the music and words together, i thought this song was magnificent.  i heard pain and inner struggle, which to me are always ingredients to great music.

the first line really struck me.  ""i never said i'd lie and wait forever.""  i think that all the time, just not in those words.  i mean, how long is the appropriate time to allow someone to mull something over?  how long should a person wait for another person?  i think i have figured out the right answer:  until it compromises happiness.  it isn't fair for anyone to have to wait, but...when a person does it willingly, in order to salvage something important to them, like a relationship of any kind, happiness is the most important determiner.  it is ok to wait for a person, but when the person who is waiting's personal happiness is impaired, the waiting must end. 

i have been waiting too long.  happiness has evaded me.  and truthfully, it is my fault.

""all the things that you never ever told me...all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me...""  that is a powerful line for me as well.  i just feel like i have waited to hear certain things for a while, and in waiting, i have allowed myself to miss so many opportunities to smile and make others smile in return.  all things considered, i live to make other people smile...so that means i have been slacking on one of my favorite pastimes.  

there is only one way to make this go feeling of incompleteness disappear:  stop playing the waiting game.  

i am willingly allowing ""all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me""...never again."

"event","and every time i hold him in my arms
or look into his eyes
i wonder this time, does it show?

i had completely forgotten about this song until today.  i was finishing my ritualistic bubble bath and as i was drying my hair, this song came on the radio.  immediately i froze and listened.  tears formed almost instantaneously as i recalled the words from my memory.  how could i have forgotten a song so beautiful as this one?  i want to think that it was just on hiatus in the back of my mind because i just don't want to even fathom the idea of me not keeping this song in high regard close to my heart.

i can't help but wonder how many times this same scenario plays out, again and again.  a man and a woman fall in love and then one of them falls out of love, and the rejected one finds someone else to fill the void, knowing that this other person can never measure up to the first lover...sounds complicated, but i think it happens a lot...more than anyone wants to admit.  i mean, when most people break up, they try to find someone else as soon as possible to relieve the pain, right?  how many times do they stop and think about the other person's effect on their life?  

dan seals really captured the uncomfortable part of finding someone new that no one ever wants to talk about:  the way that the once loved can creep into a relationship and be an active participant without even physically being there at all.

on that note, i am going to watch sex and the city and reflect on why carrie bradshaw and i have no men at this point."

"event","another month has passed since my last update...and yet again, i have fallen in love with another song.  when i heard the first words of green day's  ""boulevard of broken dreams"", i realized that the song was written just for me.  

""i walk a lonely road...the only one that i have ever known.""

these words are so beautifully simple, and so heartbreakingly complex at the same time.  the simplicity is that yes, my road is a lonely one.  the intricate complexity of the line is that it has always been that way, and from what i now know, there isn't much hope of that fact being changed.

have you ever just held on to something by a single thread?  like you are trying to save your life by clinging to this scrap that once held something together?  that is how i felt until yesterday.  up until then i at least had that thread to hang on to.  now even it has been pulled loose from my hands and it feels like i am free-falling into oblivion.  actually, that is wrong:  it isn't oblivion at all.  it is exactly what i have always done.

i walk alone.

however, i am really proud of myself for the simple fact that i did the one thing that i normally can't do:  say what i want to say to someone face-to-face.  when i confronted the person of my thoughts, dreams, prayers, and lust, i was politely denied the thing that i wanted and have wanted for over a year now.  was it wrong of me to say what i needed to say?  i don't think so.  i didn't cry at that moment either.  i was able to hold off until i was half-way home.  needless to say, i nearly wrecked the truck when i hit a spot of ice on the road.  i was so deep into my crying fit that i didn't even realize i was taking a curve at that rate of speed.  thankfully, no one was in the other lane or this post wouldn't have made it today...or any other, i am certain.

of course, there are other things to be thankful for as well...like the fact that i found this perfect song.  and that i have finally arrived at the following conclusion:

i walk alone.

better late than never, huh?"

*sigh*

why can't i find someone who wants to steal my pain?  not that i have a lot of pain, but still...the thought of a total love...someone who wants to experience even the most unpleasant situations just to be closer to me...now that is a real man.  i already know the answer to this question:  there are no real men left.

after what has now been dubbed ""the worst date in history"", i have concluded that i don't care anymore about the status of my personal life.  i would rather remain single than be in that kind of misery.  on the up side though, 'momma's boy' hasn't called back anymore!  hehehe

my musical tastes have shifted again this week.  i am falling in love with seether.  big surprise...they are all over the place.  hehehe  i have read and listened to the words of 'broken' so many times that i know them by heart.  i can't get that image of pain outta my head for some reason.  i guess after this past weekend, it is all i can think about.  it was a painful period these last few days.  i guess i should explain.

i thought i was going to see someone who i care a great deal for over the weekend as i, in turn, did a favor for a friend.  so i drove 2 hours and was shocked to see that my friend didn't need my help after all.  while i was there, i thought i would still get to see the person i really wanted to see, but he acted as though it didn't really matter if he saw me or not.  and that shattered my heart into so many slithers and shards that i haven't been able to gather them all, let alone piece them back together again.  so, in a veil of fresh tears rolling down my cheeks, i drove 2 hours back home.  my eyes were so swollen that i went directly to bed and slept for 12 hours.  

i suppose the real question that i am dying to have answered for me is how can i care so much for someone who honestly doesn't give a shit about me?  is it some sort of mystery that i am not supposed to ever understand?  or is it simply a paradox that seems to have an answer, yet disappears in a fleeting moment as i am just about to grasp it?  who knows...

on that note...i am going to go watch 'he's a lady'.  those men are currently the only ones who do not irritate, disappoint, or perplex me."

that is how the song goes.  and boy is it true.

i went out last night with a normal guy...yeah, first one in a long time.  i guess i had forgotten why i don't go for normal guys.  well, trust me...i remembered really quickly.

don't get me wrong...this guy was uber nice.  i guess that is why i just didn't gel with him.  there was no banter, no chemistry at all.  he was totally silent for most of the drive and when he did talk, he was so quiet that i had to get him to repeat himself.  this made me feel bad, like i wasn't interested in what he said.  i know he is really shy, but still...i am shy when i first meet people, but i will speak.  

another thing about this date was that it just didn't feel right.  i felt stifled by his presence.  i mean, i wore the same clothes i would usually wear to work when we went out.  that is not how i really dress.  i like my plastic and rubber bracelets and beads and sugar daddy socks and puffy balls in my hair.  this guy was, nicely put, a nice guy.  really straight-laced with no imagination.  what is the fun in that?

i feel awful, but i am just not attracted to him at all.  i guess i am not over the last abnormal guy i dated.  his unpredictability was what made him fun and unique.  with last night's encounter, i felt like i knew every thought he had for the whole duration we were together.  

i know i should just tell this guy now that i have no interest in him, but i don't want to disappoint him.  oh, the pain and agony of being me!  *sigh*"

yes, i know it has been a while since i last journaled, but i have a good reason.  life has just gotten in the way here lately.  please forgive my lack of entries.

i love conway twitty, by the way.  i have been listening to a lot of classic country here lately.  i just get in these moods where i have to listen to certain types of music and if i don't it feels like i am defying all that is good.  the voices in my head have been crying out for 70s and 80s country over the past month or so, and who am i to go against my own muses?  i even downloaded some ronnie milsap today.  what planet was i on?

yep, i have got to stop saying that phrase.  i realize that i use it all the freakin' time and that annoys me.  i hate to just pick up something and use it all the time, but it seems that this has happened with the expression, ""what planet are you on?""  i have no idea where it came from or what makes me use it all the time, in nearly every conversation.  i can find a way to sneak it in, sure enough, if the conversation lasts long enough.  i am on a personal campaign to stop using the phrase, but i know i am going to need help.  perhaps electric shock could help.  you know, like those dog collars that help train dogs to obey their masters.  hmmm...it is a thought.  perhaps a last-resort type thing, if needed.

anywho...back in september, inuyasha was cancelled in japan.  i have been devastated since hearing the news.  as far as i know, the series doesn't even end on a good note.  i have read that it just ends, without any absolution or plot finalization.  that is horrible, because i think the story could have had a wonderful ending.  oh well...what can i do, other than complain?

which reminds me...i just found out that complaining is a sin.  i had no idea that complaining was a sin until a friend told me about a sermon she had heard in church that taught her about the dangers of complaining.  it is amazing what is a sin these days, ya know?  seems like every time you turn around, boom!  you have sinned.  perhaps it is the changing of the tide that i have heard so much about from preachers and ministers.  this so-called ""change"" will lead to the destruction of the earth.  now that is a heavy thought.  on a lighter note, i have been trying to keep my complaining to a minimum since receiving that news.

dude, i got a dell!  i had been wanting a new computer for years and i finally broke down and called the dell people.  it only took a week to get here, even though the guy on the phone said it wouldn't even ship until the 18th.  so much for his knowledge, huh?  it is all a ploy anyway...he only told me that so i would be happy and joyous when the computer was delivered way before the ship date.  of course he is hoping that i send in a customer comment card praising him...too bad i forget his name.

well, it is getting late and this is the latest i have stayed up on a day before work in quite some time.  it must be the new evil laptop that has caused me to stay up past my bedtime.  mental note to self:  set clock on computer up an hour so i will trick myself into going to bed earlier through the week.  hey, it could work...maybe.

and with that last confusing thought, i am off to throw some snuggle sheets into the dryer, turn down the covers, and dream of dancing kangaroos.  xxxooo"

i know my last entry was about a dream i had, but man, i keep having these dreams that are just incredible.  i don't know of any other way to describe them:  simply incredible.  when i went on vacation with my family last month, i had this dream about making out on a porch swing with this guy.  one word: amazing!  but the other night i had another delightful escapade in my sleep.  last week i bought new bedding for my room and i bought a net that goes over my bed.  it looks very regal and prissy, something i never thought i would like, but i really like it.  it just adds something to the room, to the bed.  anyway, in my dream i was in bed and dream man (yes, i will call him that :P) came into my room.  in the dream it was daytime and sunlight streamed through the window onto his face.  i remember being so shocked to see him that i my breath hitched and he crawled under my covers up toward my face.  i can still remember seeing his head pop up under the covers over me, hair all a mess and grinning like a cross between the devil and the cheshire cat.  such a lovely face to touch.  anyway...he pulled the white mesh net over my bed and we rolled up in the covers and...well, i am a lady after all.  :P

on that note (and what a note it was!)...i am going to go back to bed.  :P"

"event","i had to journalize the most wonderful dream i had last night.  i just can't NOT write this one down.  it felt so real...so perfect, in fact.  here goes...

in my dream, i was on stage, practicing for a performance.  it was as if i was back in choir at college or something, but this was a musical i was practicing, i think.  anywho...we were doing a full dress rehearsal with costumes and props.  i was wearing this white sundress that i have.  it is super cute, with orange and pink butterflies on the bodice and skirt.  i was singing and dancing across the stage, hearing the chorus behind me.  it felt so grand to be on a stage again, for any reason.

and then...i looked out into the audience and saw him.  by him, i mean a man who has held my heart, body, and soul in the very palm of his hand since i first met him.  there he was, sitting out there, watching. when i was done with the number, i looked out and he was gone.  he was now backstage, working on something for the show.  i ran to him and touched his arm.  it was as if a shock ran through my body with that simple yet eager touch.  i noticed his hair next, which was long and tied back low.  i reached behind him and undid the tie, watching the hair fall around his face.  it framed his features perfectly.      i ran my fingers through it, each time his face coming closer to my own.  i wanted to kiss him so badly, and his lips looked so deliciously sweet.  just as i reached up on my tip toes to close the gap between us, he moved away from me.  he said he couldn't do that again, that this was not a good idea.  he left and went back to his seat in front of the stage.  

when i saw him again during the show, he had cut all his hair off.  it was so different, because i cannot imagine him without long hair at all.  it felt like he had done it to spite me, because he knew how much i loved feeling those long, silky strands between my fingers.  halfway through my performance, i simply ran offstage and sat by him.  i reached up to touch the stubble that was now his hair.  it wasn't the same, but the sensations were just as powerful.  i looked into his eyes and asked if i could touch his hand, but got no reply.  i leaned over him and wrapped my fingers around those of his right hand.  he tried to  pull away, but i wouldn't let go.  i remember telling him that i would never let go again.  he chose that moment to smile at me and squeeze my hand in reassurance that i would never have to.

that smile was priceless and even though i am awake now, i can see it when i close my eyes.  his face moved toward mine then again and unlike before, he gave me what i wanted most: a kiss that seemed to scorch my skin.  i felt him gently tug on my bottom lip and i tried to do the same, but it was as if he dominated my mouth.  he explored my mouth with his tongue, leaving no crevice or tooth untouched.  it felt just like it once did.  he touched my face with his hands, smoothed my skin with his fingers.  it was just like the first kiss all over again.  when we were both gasping for air, he moved away from me and i saw his eyes on me.  i could have drowned in their warm, rich color.  

when i woke up this morning, i felt drained.  it was as if i hadn't slept at all.  i got ready for church and believe it or not, i wore the white sundress, the dress in my dream.  now as it hugs my skin i can still feel his fingers caressing the skin of my cheeks.  although i can't figure out the hair thing, or why he chose to kiss me after not wanting to beforehand, i am sure that this dream will be replayed over and over a thousand times today and everyday for quite some time.  

which leads me to ask one simple question...
why are you haunting me?"

"event","from the first moment i heard this song, i fell in love with the way it made me feel.  don't ask me why...i'm not really sure.  i used to play it during my free period at school.  one day my class came in and heard me singing/listening and one of the girls gave me a new perspective on this song.  she said that whenever she heard it, she thought that this must be how God felt.  i had always liked the song before, but now, it is just breathtaking.  God is not just a part of something; He is the whole of all the parts combined.  it never fails to amaze me just how insightful a 16-year-old can really be. 

of course this makes me wonder about my own insights at 16.  i want to think i grasped things like this at 16, but i can't remember, which means i probably didn't since it hasn't stayed with me.  oh well...the glories and failures of youth are but a fading moment in the sands of time.  glories and failures...neither are worth the time taken to process them in an afterthought.  

i have been doing a lot of thinking lately about my life.  i am coming to terms with myself at 23, since i had a birthday 1 month ago.  23 is really scaring me.  i'm not for sure that i accomplished all that much at 22, so what will 23 bring?  i can't predict what will happen to me in the coming year, but i am looking forward to trying something different...

which brings me to my next conquest:  i talked to jenn today and she just moved to knoxville.  there is an ice cream truck that runs by her house every evening, even on sundays.  i am sooo excited!  buying ice cream from a truck that plays calliope music is on my list of things i must do before i die.  i am making plans to visit her in the near future to fulfill this life-long fantasy.  a real ice cream truck!  how much better can life be than this?

on that note, i am going to bed to dream of butter pecan and superman swirls in a waffle cone.  mmmm...."

"event","yeah, i know it has been forever since i last updated, but i don't really care.  the only thing that matters is that i am here now and that school is over for nearly 3 glorious months!  can i get a hell yeah from all the other teachers out there, or at least an amen, sister?  hehehe

so much has happened these past few months, i couldn't possibly include it all in one single entry.  amazingly enough, i am sitting here watching 'pretty in pink' and i can't think of any of that great stuff.  totally weirf, huh?  (throw back to jenn there...i love you, wherever you are, babe!)

i have discovered some wonderful sounds lately though.  i am now obsessed with brand new.  i was reading this great fic and this authoress had used a song as the basis for her story.  well, i love the story so i wanted the song.  needless to say, i just fell in love with the sounds made by the band.  they are different from what i usually listen to, but change is good.  i am really into their lyrics.  for example, one of my favorite songs on their 2003 cd is such a beautiful metaphor about a relationship gone bad.  the hints are subtly placed in the song, but it compares a bad break-up to a shipwreck.  and why not?  most people feel like their lives have been wrecked by huge waves after losing someone they love, right?  anyway, the guy actually takes responsibility for screwing everything up by  not keeping his big mouth in check.  i think that is one of the reasons i love the song so much.  the singer admits that the tongue is such a sharp, dangerous weapon that can destroy anything in its path.  it is so profound how he compares it to the rudder of a ship.  i just love it.  i used this song in my english 9 class as an example of a metaphor in poetry.  the kids really seemed to like it.  i was shocked!  hehehe

i went back to the lloyd for their graduation in may.  it was good to see old friends and familiar faces for a change instead of young ones that i do not connect with at all.  don't get me wrong, i love my job.  it is really wonderful though when you can see people you can connect with on a more intellectual level.  besides, friends are special!  i saw so many people that i had lost contact with or just missed for so long.  being with them and going out like normal people was so refreshing for me.  and yes, i do feel sorry for any waiter or waitress who has to deal with all of us together at one time!  hehehe  may God bless you all for such patience and great service!  :P

it is raining.
yes.
it is cold.
yes.
it is april fool's day.
no.
i have not been pranked today.
take that!
ha!

today has been a decent day.  it started with me having a temper tantrum with the cat and throwing him by his hind legs across the couch.  he was irking me to an even higher degree than before.  i was trying to eat my breakfast, which consisted of milk and cheez doodles, and here he came, waltzing across my couch, onto the arm of my chair, expecting me to pet him.  gimme  a break!  i don't get petted that early in the morning, so why the hell should he?

oh yeah, i forgot to mention that i got a cat this weekend.  don't ask me why i have him...i am still trying to figure it out myself.  my friend had him for a year or so, and she got puppies for Christmas, so i told her i would take the cat off her hands.  she was afraid he was going to get hurt, so here i am with him now.  he has been an adjustment though.

i meant to write this in here sunday, since that was the day tyler and i went and retrieved him from kentucky.  conley met us in pikeville with butter...yes, his name is butter...and i nearly lost him in a parking lot before she had even gotten out of site.  sign #1...

tyler drove me down there in his car because we knew we couldn't carry us, the cat, and all the crap we wanted from p-ville in my truck...sorry troy the toy, but you just ain't big enough sometimes.

anywho...tyler was driving back and we were coming through the high nars past the breaks.  he must have been so absorbed in driving and listening to my him cd that he completely forgot about butter in the backseat, in the pet taxi.  he was talking to me and then as we rounded a steep curve, i heard a loud THUD from the back.  

then, on cue, tyler yells ""OH SHIT!""  

i was like, ""what is wrong?""  i unbuckled my safety belt and turned around and there, in the backseat, turned upside down, was my pet taxi.  inside the taxi, also upside down, was butter.  i guess the law of gravity took over and the one about cats always landing on their feet is null and void when inside a pet taxi, 'cause butter was on his head.

i was horrified...in my mind i knew this poor cat was scared for life...and then i hear tyler in the seat beside me, cackling hysterically.  he pulled the car over and just laughed for what felt like an hour.  and then he started telling me about seeing it in the rear view mirror, and before i knew what was happening, i was laughing too, beyond control.  it was soooo funny.  tyler laughed so hard he actually cried.  tears streaked down his face while i was trying to turn the cat right-side-up.  we made it home unscathed, thankfully.

anywho...that was my induction into the world of cats.  and on that note, i am gonna go do some serious back-piled laundry."

today was the most beautiful day.  the weather was perfect, not hot, not cold, but just perfect.  the breeze blew gently, and i could smell spring, faintly of course, but spring has a scent that is distinctly her own.  i can't wait...only a few more weeks and it will be swinging weather.  i could have gone tonight, but i wasn't in the mood to swing alone.  i am in a happy funk for a change, and i want to share my happiness with everyone i see.  i could have sworn people glared evil spears at  me today while i was at work, simply because i was so jubilantly happy.  nothing ruined my good mood though...well, almost nothing.

a friend made a cd for me last night to use in my class.  i hadn't even listened to it all the way through today when someone stole it!  man...i am pissy at the very thought of someone stealing from me, especially at school.  grr...

oh well...i came home and did some gardening to make myself feel better.  of course it worked and i feel joyful again.  all is right with the world once more...and my pansies will germinate in 10 days.  oh, the thrill of it all!"

i am happy to say---note the term ""happy""---that my depression is officially over.  why, you ask?  simple, i reply. last night was monday night, and nothing makes me feel better than watching wrestling on monday nights.  after seeing hot, sweaty men with chiseled bodies display feats of physical strength that rival the gods of olympus, there is no way any normal female could not feel euphoric.  highlights of the night:  the return of edge, who is one of the top 10 sexiest canucks to ever cross the border, and seeing hhh rip his shirt off not once, but twice.  now that is prime time television!  shoooo

i watched the rock and roll hall of fame induction last night.  i cried when i saw george harrison's son dahni accept his award.  george's music touches me the way nothing can.  whenever i hear ""something"", it is almost as if my soul is unleashed from the chain that attaches it to my body.  i can feel myself floating away, thinking about ""the way she moves"".  songs like that are gifts to those of us who need them, like rain to a lone palm tree in the humid desert.  whoa...that was beautiful.  that was for you george, all for you.

"event","i have heard this song a lot lately, and it has made me do some serious thinking.  22 for me is almost over.  in less than 2 months i will be 23.  22 has been like a shot in the pan.  i finally know what my momma means when she says that.  she also told me a long time ago that time goes faster once you reach 20.  and she is right...i can't believe how quickly my life is passing.  

i have done so much reflecting this past week.  it has been therapeutic and healing, but it has also hurt like hell.  It has been a heart-wrenching experience, but i have made a lot of realizations.  after feeling like pain and dementia's lovechild all week, i turned all my tears over to God on thursday morning.  when i woke up, i thanked Him for letting me be here and i asked Him to help me carry my burdens.  ever since thursday morning i have felt wonderful, and i haven't cried once.

realization #1:  i am a great, wonderful, and beautiful person who is truly blessed by God.

realization #2:  just like the song says, you can lead a heart to love, but you can't make it fall.

realization #3:  time does exist, no matter what anyone says.

realization #4:  baseball is still the best sport ever and nothing, and i mean NOTHING beats seeing a man in those baseball pants!  mmmm

realization #5:  in order for me to be happy, i have to keep my newfound realizations in mind at all times, and combine them if at all possible.

translation:  i need to fall in love with a man who thinks i am great and wonderful, who will love me equally, all the time (and soon), and is a baseball player with great lines!

well, i think i can do without one of those...he doesn't have to think i am great all the time, as long as he looks good in those pants!  :D

1.  what is wrong with me?

this is open to discussion at this point.  i have claw marks on my wrists, fingers, and arms.  i look like a leper.  damn rabbit.

2.  what is wrong with me?

i can't face facts or simple truths.  i have deceived myself for so long that the lines between reality and fantasy are so blurred that i can't tell the difference.  i feel like i am caught in a labrinth and can't escape.

3.  what is wrong with me?

i am a believer, a lover, a dreamer, and a realist.  is all that a huge contradiction?  

4.  what is wrong with me?

i am in love with someone who doesn't love me back.  and it is killing me softly, slowly, but surely.

with that said, i am going to figure out the rest of the questions that are giving me a raging headache."

"event","how can anyone say that fats domino was not a soulful singer with the most wonderful songs?  blue monday's score alone is enough to make anyone feel the dank depression of a soured monday...but with the lyrics, damn...

sorry for no update as of late.  these past few days have been the worst kind of hell.  i am sinking further into my depression.  it is almost a full-time job for me now, remaining in this distasteful disposition.  and you know me...if it feels like work, it blows hard.

friday was one of the worst days i have had in a long time.  i went to the dentist hoping she could alleviate my pain.  i suppose it was silly of me to hope that by paying someone a crap-load of money (actually, my insurance paid a crap-load...i only paid 13 bucks) that i could eat like a normal human being again.  today is monday and the tooth hurts more now than it did before i had it filled.

i was in a foul mood all day friday...things happened or didn't happen as i wanted them to, so what did i do to make myself feel better? i shopped...bought shoes of all things...like i needed more shoes...and a new closet to put them in.  that is what i do when i am depressed.  i buy useless junk and eat a lot more junk.  i knew i wouldn't have anything to do friday night, since i would be alone, so i bought a closet and assembled it myself.  try it...taking your frustrations out on something packaged in taiwan is a great way to forget your loneliness on a friday night.  my recommendation:  2 thumbs up, all the way.

my dad was no help in the cheerfulness department, and he accused me of ""sassing"" him.  i just went back to my house and then my mother visited me.  i didn't mean to gripe at her, but i was just so pissy at that moment i would have wailed on anyone (including the undertaker...swoon!) later that night, she mixed her meds together accidentally and nearly died.

seeing her like that made me feel like a complete ass.  i stayed with her the rest of the weekend, even though my brother cussed at me and dared me to touch her.  when she stopped breathing on me twice friday night, i nearly lost my mind.  everything i had learned in that cpr class just went out the window. this was my mother, the strongest woman on the planet, and she needed my help and i was useless.  i tried to wake her up, and finally i did, but i have never been that scared in my life.  she is feeling only slightly better today.

tomorrow are writing sols, and i am not nervous, just uneasy, dreading the ""quiet"" time needed for test taking.  i know the kids will do well, so that takes a lot off my mind.

i think i have said way more than i ever intended to say tonight, and with that thought floating around in my head, i will go on to bed before i remember something else i am unhappy about."

snow day!  woo-hoo!  i was so friggin' happy this morning that i nearly fell out of bed and dislocated my hip.  well, it wasn't exactly a snow day, but at least we were on a delay.  i needed the extra z's, no doubt.  i stayed up late watching inuyasha.  damn cartoon network for moving it on me to 12:30.  i have been having freaky dreams these past few nights.  i have been waking at unusual times, burning up, sweat covered, heartbeat racing like the speed of light.  strange things plague me in my sleep.

speaking of whack dreams: a few weeks ago, i had the most wonderfully erotic dream i have ever had.  don't get me wrong, i have had some zingers, but this one was...mmmm.  the only words that can describe it:  sensual ecstasy.  it wasn't a purely sex-oriented dream.  actually, there was no sex at all...that is right...virgin's dreams aren't always about sex, ya know.  it was innocent and simple, but so passionate and complete at the same time.  funny, but i had almost forgotten how sexy a single kiss can be, when done just the right way...hands on each side of the face, thumbs stroking the skin lightly, and the feel of a soft mouth pressed against mine.  uh oh...it is gettin' hot in here!

hard to believe, but i felt that exact sensation in my dream...so familiar.  i haven't told anyone though...i am already a freak.  why add perverted freak to my list of qualities?  :P  but...it was an intense, fantastic dream.

anywho...i think it is time that i go to bed.  i just graded 14 test papers.  more like test booklets, actually...10 pages each.  took me an hour to get them done.  i think i deserve an cat nap.  who knows....may have an even better dream this time!  hehehe  g'night!"

'nough said.

over the past few weeks things have been going really well.  my kids are doing well.  i think they all have a great shot to pass those f'in' SOLs, which would make me really happy.  i dunno...if they fail the stupid thing, then i would actually have a legitimate reason to yell and throw things in class.  wait...i didn't have one before?  not good...mental note to self: bribe kids with free food for not filing child abuse charges.

speaking of food, i have vowed never to enter a certain eating establishment ever again.  i bought food for the fam there last week...wasn't good.  in fact, it wasn't even cooked!  talk about a pissy red-head at that moment...my poor dad nearly choked on a piece of barely thawed chicken.  if the m.s. and the cancer don't kill him, raw chicken is the back-up plan, right?

well, i have been doing some soul-searching and i have decided that it is time to start singing again.  yeah, i pussy-foot around every now and then, but i don't really sing.  my voice has just not wanted to live for the past year or so...and i have my reasons for that.  i think it is about time to bring her outta retirement, don't you?  i've been practicing, especially harmonies, since those are hardest for me.  not quite so hard anymore, when i want to sing.  that is the thing...people keep bothering me about it...it is almost enough to make me wish it all away...almost, but not quite.

another huge feather in my cap is that i finally figured out how to program my vcr monday.  now for some this might not be such a  big deal, but those people who are technologically impaired, such as myself, this is quite an achievement.  now i can record inu yasha and witch hunter robin and not drag into school in the mornings looking like i am on a permanent hang over.  for a person who has never been drunk in my life, i sure know a lot about it, huh?  lol

well, i have a lot to do tonight before i can snuggle into my crisp, clean sheets.  i think that is a nice thought to end with...don't you?"

"event","so...here i am.  never in a million years did i plan to start writing here.  it's just that all i hear from everyone is that livejournaling is the thing to do...so i decided i better see what all the hype is about.

no school today.  all i can say is thank God.  i really wanted a day off, and i used it well...didn't get out of bed until 3 this evening.  i'm paying for it now though, since it is midnight and i am wide awake.  it is times like these, just before falling asleep, that i get the urge to write.  crazy, i know...

i have done nothing but read today, while i was actually awake.  i like this existence...nothing but a book, my bed, and me.  i had forgotten what it felt like to think of nothing but reading for pleasure until this snow day brought it all back to me.  actually, i did quite a lot of internet reading today.  i like reading other people's fics on-line.  it amazes me to think about all the great writers i get to read on here everyday who have never written professionally in their lives.  kinda makes me feel like i should be writing again.  just another reason for being here at midnight i guess.  

i read a few more chapters of ""a bus stop fairytale"" today, as well as ""hello again"".  both of those are really great stories.  ""broker pieces"" had a new chapter up too, and i have been waiting for a long time to read that one...nearly a month.  the ladies, or at least i think they are ladies, who write these are really great writers.  

anywho...got my costume for halloween in the mail today.  i know it is still a long way away, but i wanted to get it and not worry about it.  i decided i am going as inu yasha this year.  i love him...great character.  such a pain in the ass!  i love him.  i dunno...he fits my mindset these days.  

well, this has been an experience.  i don't know how often i can stomach writing in this thing, but i might as well try it, right?  lol"

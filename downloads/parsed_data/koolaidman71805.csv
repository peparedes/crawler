"event","Well its a new year nothin bad so far, jess and i made up and are friends agian. Thigns are getting better between us, so why do i still feel like there is something missing? I guess its cause me and her are still alittle rocky, we dont have that friendship we once had. But its to be expected relationships change the way people feel about each other. Its been 2 years and denise is still mad at me. But at least jess talks to me sometimes, that makes my day so much better. Who knows...maybe someday we will be back to the way things were someday. That would make my life perfect, but i guess i just have to take things one step at a time. On the other hand im thinking about getting my realty lisence to kinda have a back up just in case the game design and visual effects dont work out. And now im planing for an appartment so money is going to have to be saved. I cant wait to move out my house cause then i would have more privacy and see how i can make it on my own. It also gives me a chance to show my parents i can do things on my own, they never believed i could so now i can show them that there wrong. Well i guess thats it for now take care everyone later."

Well maybe she will know what i went through now, i wish she would realize that i still care for her and would never hurt her agian. But i guess im not so lucky to be with her, i miss her so much. I guess i still love her, but that love with never be returned. If only she would realize that there is someone here who cares for her and would never leave her side. But i guess nothing can bring her back to me, i will always love her but i will have to live without her."

Like my power cord for my laptop just died on me and my parents didnt want to order me a new one that i would pay for cause they wanted to teach me a lesson? Uh yea sure me failing a college class is teaching me a good lesson. Now i might get kicked out cause my GPA went below it was supposed to...i hope there happy. Sigh, things look like there never going to get any better for me. Its like im not ment to be happy or anything. I mean i have good times but im not really happy.

Sigh i hate it i mean they couldnt even order a freakin $23 power cord no...but they can go out and get my brother a new phone, pen drive, cds,games,movies....yes all in one day.

I just wish that we could talk and get all this fighting over with. I have had so much pain this month...not from how she is acting toward me, but that the fact i havent seen or talked to her in so long. She dosent understand anything about how i feel right now cause she wont give me us a chance to talk. I just want to leave all those bad memories behind. I cant forget the good ones...so many good ones. Its just hard to believe i thought she was happy with me. Thats what hurt me the most finding out she wasnt happy. Thats all i want for her is for her to be happy, i would do anything for her to be happy. Even if i have to leave from her life...if she will be happy that why then i will too. Its just how i feel i know its stupid but thats how i feel. I want to protect her...to be there for her whenever she needs me and then some. I care about her so much...sigh...its just really hard. I know now that i have to let God end this, i have tried so many things to try to fix things between us. But she has pushed me away. She made me so happy...before i met her i wasnt really happy. It was just fake, but after she came into my life things got so much better and all my problems just went away when i was with her. I just wish she would see that i care about her and want to be by her side when she needs me. I would never hurt her or do anything to hurt her. I care about her so much and thats how i will always feel...I love her with all my heart and soul. And thats all there is too it, no matter what the out come of this is i just want her to be happy and to see her smile agian."

Its hard to find someone like jessica...though i heard that she is actually calming down a bit which made me kinda sad. But i guess shes just growing up, i wish i could be there to see her grow up though. Even though she doesnt like me i still see her as my best friend. I felt like crap today...after what that girl did to me im really starting to doubt that there is someone out there for me. I actually though she liked me...She called and i told her i saw her at the mall. She said she did like me but she just wanted to make the other guy jelous. *sigh* I was used agian...i guess thats all im good for is being used to get other guys jelous. I should charge for that or something...*sigh* I wish i could just rip that part about wanting a gf out of my head. Im tired of getting hurt and getting blamed for everything.

I guess to put it simpler terms...im acting like more of an adult. But i still act like my old self once in a while though.

"event","Yup i have to say things are all cleared up now...well one more thing still needs to be cleared up but im not worrying about that now. I just got a letter from the bank that there was an error on my account and i have all my money back. College is going smoothly, friends area doing alright. Yea life is great right now. I couldnt go to pigskin for two reasons,  one i was busy all day. And two is something that i have to keep private for now. I hope to go to BOA in San Antonio joe said he would try to meet me there but no promises. Well even if hes not there i wonder if i can get some of my new friends to go with me. That would be cool to go to SA for a weekend. Well im going to try to go to the tournament at Gotham not to play just to watch. G2G later everyone."

"event","Yea things are going awesome for me now. College life is great. I hang out with my friends all the time, i have even got a random kiss the other day for driving a girl home (a friend). Yea they like me alot from what they say, that i bring them good times and laughs. Im happy now, i miss alot of my old friends alot though. Last night i went out with two of my new college friends eric and adasely...ok i cant spell her name. I like adasely shes cute and very nice. Her cheeks are really soft ^_^ but alas she only thinks of my as a friend but thats good anyway. Well tonight i might go to BWW with erice and adasely agian so take care everyone later."

"event","Well i dont know why but today seems like something is new about me. I feel different, kinda more my age i guess. I think its cause i havet been with my high school friends for a while. I have been hanging out with people more my age which is pretty awesome. My freind samantha is down in a way. She was supposed to get married like this month but her uh fiance called it off. I feel really bad for her cause she was looking forward to her wedding day. If i was that guy i wouldnt do that to her...shes really nice and a little cutie. Though i did find out alot about her this year (shes a kinky little girl lol). But she looks so inocent like i have never seen her wear jeans, shes always wearing a skirt thing. But shes not really that girly. To tell the truth i have always liked her ever since middle school, but now more than ever since i got to see the real her. I have also started to make a manga kinda thing that i wanna make a livejournal for since i have a scanner. Its called Chibi Life, its kinda my chibi character with alot of my friends all chibi style. I have just started to sketch myself so yea. Well i guess thats all for now take care everyone."

Played some melee, soul calibar, other games. I owened lol, then i got to sleep over cause it was like 2 am when i wanted to go home but they didnt want me to drive that late. Then i came home and got ready for church, but my sister was here so i had to stay home cause i hardly see her anymore. Sorry steven i will try to go sometime lol. Man this is like the 2nd week i havent gone to church. I really need to go to church, i finish the editing for my story, and start my new one. I will get to all that sometime.

"event","Well...i guess things are getting back to normal. But jessica said that i could fix things if i leave her alone for 2 months. I didnt even know that i was in her life so much, i never really talked to her in person or even went up to her. I dont even know how this 2 month thing will fix things, i mean we would have to talk about it sooner or later and then things will go back to they way things were. I guess i just wanted her to give me more info about it, not just ""leave me alone for 2 months and things will be fixed"". And the down side is that i cant even go to the bandhall to see my friends cause of this agreement. I guess she wants time to think about things, kinda see how things are without me. And i think she would enjoy life without me...i really do miss her alot. She was a cool friend to me, i dont know what i did to make her act this way. She say to me ""its not like i dont ever want to see you agian"" i think...im alittle hazy cause of the passing out thing. Maybe she needs time...if so she should have just said that and not made it so hard to understand. I dont want you in my life means to me that i hate you and i never want to see you agian. But i guess maybe thats what she ment...idk im still kinda hazy on everything. But i guess i will wait it out and see what happens i guess i will see everyone in december later."

I dont remember what really happend,its all just a haze to me. I get these kinda weird flashbacks of what happend but there short. I remember me and jessica talked about something, i just dont remember what. And i remember my head was really hurting and that everything was just to much for me to take right now. I dont know what to do right now...i have just been feeling so weak and tired. There's alot of things going on in my head and its kinda hard to sort them all out.

And now hes tellin me that i should go to jenny's party cause only people who hate me are going to go. So that just ruiend my day, and it was going pretty good at that.

And were actually serious about this, its going to be an experience. Im actually looking forward to that, see how i can do on my own well my friends will be there but still. I wonder what i feel is missing, its weird. Started working with photoshop and getting it down pretty well. My story is being redone quit nicely from what i heard, maybe steph was right things will get better with the new year thats comeing. But i guess it was just all in my head to begin with. The way i looked at my problems this whole time made it seem worse than it really was. i am currently working an another story this kind is going to be really hard for me but i have been thinking about it for like years. Well i guess thats all for now busy day tomorrow must try to rest."

I realized now that no matter what i do i cant forget. Everything leads back to her, and she wants nothing to do with me. What do you to in this kinda of situation, there's nothing i can do anymore. Its so hard to believe that were like this now...and that its all my fault. Before i made her so happy...now i only make her mad or sad, am i such a bad person. I want to stop writeing about her, and thinking about her but i dont want to forget the good memories we have. Where she would look at me and smile. If i had a second chance i would make her so happy, i would try my hardest to giver her anything she wanted. I know thats shes the only one for me...in my heart i know its true. GOD...why cant i forget, why cant i stop this. Look how she is treating me God...why do you keep sending me back to her! How much more do i have to suffer for it to end. My heart is in so much pain now...i dont want to love her anymore! She stopped loveing me a long time ago why cant i do the same! What about me does she hate so much...what did i do?  I cant stand not knowing these things! God...jessica...please forgive me, im not strong enough to forget. Im not strong enough to let go the ones i love, im sorry for everything and everything that im not. Im sorry grandpa...i let my emotions get the best of me, you were right all along. Im just not strong enough..."

Plus this girl is like 20, though she does have alot of the interestes i like. But i just dont want it to turn out like another thing with jessica. But i guess we all have to take a risk every now and again right. I really do like this girl though shes pretty cool. I might ask her out this thursday when i see her but im still kinda doubtfull on the whole thing. Oh well we will see what happens.

But then i have to get up and go to church later and maybe get my hair cut plus a melee tournament. I might stop going to those cause i dont have much money right now. There was another 39.12 charge on my account and we dont know what it is. It just says support.com which is weird, MMMMMMMMM i love appy juice. I have been writeing alot but not on LJ. I have a secret personal journal that i keep alot of stuff in. Im watching the movie dodge ball, i really want to play that game now. I have been working with photoshop and im getting use to it i must say, the wall paper in myspace.com thing i made from photoshop.

I never got a chance to explain myself to you...explain why i acted the way i did those last few months. Whats wrong with me that i lose the ones i love the most. I loved you with all my heart and soul, i would do anything for you. And now if this is what makes you happy, then i will be happy. I just wish i knew what i did to make you feel this way. Gosh your so beautiful as i remember your sweet innocent face....i cant help but write about you now, my heart is in so much pain. Im glad your not in this kind of pain...at least i dont think you are. I wish i could have been a better friend to you my sweet little angel. The perfect girl...and i let you down. I let you down in the worst way, i wish i knew what that way was so i can make up for it. Although i dont think there is anything that i can do. *sigh* well now begins the long process of trying to get over you. But i know that i will never get over the perfect girl, Theres no one like you in the world...and theres no one that can replace my love for you. I promise that i never ment to hurt you or annoy you in anyway. All i wanted was to be there for you and help you, things will get better for you i know it. I still have a long path before i find the light, but the memories of you that i carry with me weill see me through. I will miss you and i will never forget you my sweet angel...farewell be happy and never forget my love for you will never die."

"event","Havent updated in a while. Seems like everything is just going normal for once. Except for the fact that it think about her alot. And i have been writeing alot of short little story type things in one of the many notebooks i have. I found one from my freshmen year i took a story from it and put it in the last entry. I write about my dreams too...mostly about a certain someone. This girl i met at college and someone else. Well i went to south today so i could get my phone...im glad i got it back cause i have had some close calls and i need it. I changed the layout of my story i will go edit it so yea. I wonder who reads this...doesnt really matter cause i like to write makes me feel better. Well i guess thats all for now i will post more of my story once i decide where to cut it off later."

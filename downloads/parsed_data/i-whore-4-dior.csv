"event","Okay, so the holiday season has always put me in a charitable mood. I think it comes from when my parents would make me help out some charity every year as a kid, and the feeling of good-doing just sort of associated itself with this time of year.

Needless to say, the fact that my sister is moving to Ecuador for the Peace Corps in less than 2 months has only increased that feeling of wanting to help. 

I wish I could've come home sooner, so I could've helped some toy drive or something similar. 

In any case, I honestly get really depressed when I think about how bad it is in many other countries and I think that here I am, sitting in my cozy little room with all my clothes and things and only because I was born to Americans.

In closing, I'll leave you with another 80s relic that everyone who reads this and actually experienced 1984 is going to groan my face off for. Shhh, it's Christmas.

"event","okay so I'm mostly passed that rough patch now. No more angsty entries, I hope. :P

Jesus God allmighty am I ever looking forward to next week. no classes, yay!

I wrote a speech to present tomorrow in a class, but I think I want to change it. We were supposed to write about something we're passionate about, and my speech sucks and I hate it. I'm thinking of writing one about deathrock, but I'm afraid I'd feel like a total tool up in front of my class talking about it.

What do you guys think?"

Don't ask... I have NO idea why we bought it. :P
Then I went to go see CHRIS race with Michelle and Jakey the other day.
Alllso very fun. =)
Last night Michelle and I went to Desert Ridge.
It was pretty fun.
Lots of people were there...
John, James, Lauren, Jenn, Chris, Matt, Bond, Zach and like lots of other people.

And took Me and Michelle home for a sleepover. =)

It's Easter morning...
Just finished some cereal. Talkin' to Michelle online & listenin' to some tunes.
Drove all day yesterday and then hung with a bunch o' cool kids.
Whew! Had a pretty crazy night. =)
Had Bondley, Brandon, Corey, Michelle, Becca and Jake over.
Only had like thee funnest time EVER. :P
Okay get this...

Bond, Brandon, Michelle, Becca annnd myself are hangin' in my computer room.
Don't really know where Jake and Corey are... nor do we care, lol.
Jake calls, says Corey called a bunch of older guys bitches...
And they got a bunch of their friends and a car! LOL.
He said they were gonna beat 'em up.
So, of course Bond & Brandon get all pumped up and we walk down there.
Bond's all ready to take 'em... Even picked up a lemon on the way for a... weapon?
So finally we get down there and see Corey and Jake... all by themselves.
Friggin' retards, just wanted to see how long it'd take us to get there.
Haha, it took us like 987498 minutes too cuz Bond was messin' with his lemon.
Soo then we walked back to my house and grabbed some scooters.
Oh and Bond ran and got his Mommy's purple, low-rider bike with flames on it.
He was like obsessed with his ""cool"" bike... It had flat tires too. LOL.
Lemme give you a little visual.
Bond, Jake and Corey are all on their scooters and bikes,
Riding around my neighborhood making bird noises like little kids.
They made up a club called... I think it was the ""Night Falcons.""
And insisted on running around cooing and making a pretend bird with their hands.
I know what you're thinking...
How old are these kids again? LOLLL.
They're like five.
But I gotta admit... It was pretty cute. And flipping hilarious.

Then me and my mom took Brandon and Corey home...
We were trying to think of nicknames for Brandon.
LOL, my mom came up with Brando? Haha.

Anyways, that was my weekend. Hope everybody had a fun Spring Break. Wish I could've been herrre.

I love you all. See you at school tomorrow... =("

Michelle had to go home, so I got stuck with those three. Sounds fun, huh? lol. It was alright tho... At least it would've been if Charlie didn't drop my hot dog. God, retard. LOL, jk. Then we took everybody home and I had to do my math homework. Haha.

Pshh 'cept for me getting flipping GUM ON MY BUTT. God. Blue gum not to mention. Lol, I was cool with it tho... no big deal. I sure wished people would stop staring at my butt tho. Haha :P.

Oh and Michelle beat Brandon up. It was pretty bad. Made him get kicked off the tennis team too. Poor thing. He's supposed to start giving me and Bryttney private tennis lessons though. We can't wait... Apparently he's the best. He better flippin' be cuz me and Bryttney have to pay $40 a lesson. God. (LOL, it's Monopoly money, but he doesn't know thattt.)

"event","Omg I had THEE FUNNEST time last night. It was Fridaaay and I went to Desert Ridge with Michelle, Corey, Bondleyyy and BRANDON =). It was flipping hilarious... Not even joking. Afterwards my Mom picked us up and took us to the movies so we could see Hostage. Ew, the movie was gross. All like blood 'n gutsy. Made me and Michelle wanna hurl. But the guys seemed to like it. haha. Oh and Zach and Andrew were with us too. LOL Brandon kept like sending me texts in the movie like ""Tell Michelle she is retarded."" It was SOO funny. But back to Desert Ridge... LOL, Brandon would like me to share about him pushing Corey in the cart at Target. Alsooo HILARIOUS. We're walkin' down to Target and Brandon and Corey find a cart so Corey like jumps in and Brandon starts pushing him. Me and Michelle are just like walking behind laughing hysterically. K, try to picture this ---> Corey's in the cart screaming ""AHHHH! HELP MEEE!!"" at like the top of his lungs and Brandon's like running FULL SPEED down the parking lot in front of Target with Corey in the cart. One of the funniest things I've seen in... like a long time. Then Corey and Brandon got obsessed with trying to find a laser that they could buy and then use in the movie. Soo Brandon tells us all he KNOWS where this laser thing is in Target like 597435947690347 times. We're like ""Brandon... YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. GIVE IT UPPP."" But he just kept going "" No, it's over herrre, I swear... No, over herrre."" Lol, annnyways, we never found the laser because SOME LOSERS (a.k.a. Corey and Michelle) decided to run out of Target and back to the District part of Desert Ridge, leaving me and Brandon all alone and desertedddd =(. Then we met back up with them and Michelle begged me to forgive her. haha. So that was pretty much my Friday nighttt... Pretty flippin' awesome if I do say so myself. Don't know what's goin' on the rest of the weekend, but I'll update if something cool happens =). Talk to ya later... Haha, can't wait 2 read the comments.

"" Talking in her sleep! Like the WHOLE night. We kept waking up and hearing her talking. She is such a weirdo. LOL. Bryttney left early for Church, but Michelle stayed over and went to the Mall with me and my Mommy. She left around 5 for dinner, but we had the best time. Eww, school tomorrow. But I get to wear my new clothes and only two more weeks until SPRING BREAK! Wo0Ot Wooooot! Talk to ya'all later, lots o' LOVE.

So all of a sudden I hear Corey say "" Help him! Help him! ""... Like actually thinking I would be able to help Matt lift it up. Ha... Not. So I go over there and Corey's trying to lift it up with his one arm, I'm trying to lift it too annnd Matt's trying 2 push it up... all of us laughing hysterically. Meanwhile it's like rolling down Matt's stomach, making a big red burn and Michelle comes running out after hearing me laughing. Oh my gosh, it was TOO funny. We finally lifted it up though.

Afterwards Michelle, Jenae, Matt, Bond, Charlie, Corey, Lauren annnd myself all went to see Hitch. Haha, we thought it had ended like eight times and got up to leave and then another scene would come on, it was pretty long. Funnn though. Then we went outside and waited for my mom to come pick us up while Corey & Charlie slid all over Desert Ridge racing each other in the rain, LOL... hilarious. Then last week at school we had two half days, heck yesss. On Thursday Corey, Charlie and Michelle came over till like 3, that was pretty fun. Thennn came yesterday - flippin' awesome. My Mom came and picked Matt, Bond, Corey, Michelle and me up from school and we hung at my house for a little while. Oh my gosh, Me, Matt and Bond made two flipping HILARIOUS videos with my webcam. I'm not even joking, they've gotta be thee funniest ones on my computer. Ya gotta see 'em. Thennn Matt, Corey, Michelle and me all went to this Black Mountain BMX place to watch Charlie race, it was flippin' AWESOME. Charlie wasn't supposed to know we were there, but the plan kinda went downhill when Matt saw Charlie, Michelle pulled my hood over my face to try and hide me and then Matt and Corey walked over to Charlie just before me and Michelle ran away, hoping he hadn't seen us. Haha, we're so dumb. It was cool though, watching him race and everything. Whatta HOTTIE! Then my Mom came and picked us up and we went back to my house. Michelle flipping ditched me at like four though and left me alone to babysit Matt, Bond and Corey. LOL, I swear, all they talk about is preverted stuff. It was hilarious though. Matt is TOO funny. Omg, and when Matt & Bondley are togther... flippin' crazy. They're like little 5-year old boys that worship each other. I'm not even kidding, they both think the other one is like the coolest kid on the face of the planet, it's hilarious. Then we went to Desert Ridge... also awesome. Ahh and MATT ASKED MICHELLE OUT! Lol, too cute. She said she didn't know though... We'll see what happens. Then this mornin' I woke up to my phone that said missed call at like flipping 6:45 in the morning. Ha, it was Charlie, about to go practice his PIMPTIZZLE bike-racin' skilllls. So0o that's about it, I think I might be goin' over to Michelle's later today, but I don't know. Ohh and my previous entry, LOL, about my life sucking and hating everyone, was not entered by me. Ha! Corey did that for me, whatta sweetie :). But life's awesome, and I don't hate youuu.

Omgosh, it was hilarious - I was gettin' off the bus and Lauren sticks her head out the window and she's like "" Hannah! Mrs.Cox sucks!! "" haha. Then I came home and now I'm havin' some bruschetta on toast. MmMmMm, it's REALLY good if ya don't know what it is :). Anyways, that was just a quick entry cuz I gotta go do some homework.

"event","Hey! First entry ever!! I feel sorta stupid doin' this... Lol, whateva, here it goes--
 
Friday- School was alright.. Hard Math test, hard Science test and solo auditions in chorus... Puke. Lol, it was okay though... Mrs.Cox wouldn't tell us who got the solos though, and I really wanna know!! After that was track. It was fun... All we did was play kickball. ( A.K.A. me and Kayla talking on the field and Mrs. Saragosa telling us to help our team out, haha! ) Then I went to DESERT RIDGE around 7 w/ Michelle and we hung out w/ Breanna, Paige, Ryan, Dylan, Zach, Adam and some Dax kid that was w/ them. Lol, it was a lotta fun tho.

Saturday ( Today. )- RAIN! Me, Michelle, Gabbie, Breanna and Paige all went 2 P.V. Mall and hung out. We got dinner there. Lol, Michelle's and Breanna's consisting of french fries, a milk shake and Wetzel's Pretzels, Niiice dinner. Then I got my make up done by this lady in Victoria Secret. Eh, it's a lil weird, but it's alright... Then we went over to Breanna's and Paige H. called! I never got 2 talk 2 her, but it's all good, I can call her later. She called me last night, but I couldn't talk cuz we were leaving for Desert Ridge. Then I went home around 10 and I tried 2 figure out how 2 make my LIVEJOURNAL! I finally got it, and now I'm typing this. :) I gotta go though... I'll update l8er!"

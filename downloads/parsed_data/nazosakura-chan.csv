~I went to Harry Potter two times this weekend. =) The first time was a midnight showing that I went to with Sam and Dean...I ended up winning a fifteen dollar gift certificate to Barnes and Noble for being a total Harry Potter WHORE. QUICK--Where did Harry and his parents live before Voldemort killed Lily and James?!?! hehehe Dark Tower Six, here I come. 
~Speaking of the movie, here's a spoiler happy <lj-cut text=""opinion-type...thingy""> 
Sooo...there were many things that I was happy with, and many things that totally sucked ass. I'll start with the good things, just so people don't think I completely hated the movie, because I didn't. But I'm a nit-picking purist, so keep that in mind when you read it. Or, as Terri-chama described it: ""You're Hermione, honey. Of COURSE you'd have issues with it."" =) 

~ I did like the emotional backdrop to this movie. We had a lot less concern with how pretty and perfect the scenery and plot were, and a lot more emphasis on how the characters felt about and interacted with each other. I enjoyed that. 
~ Michael Gambon--the new Dumbledore--was chou beri good. At first I was concerned that he didn't bring any levity to the role, but after seeing it again, I liked his performance. He was energetic and much more of the Dumbledore I had envisioned. I missed Richard Harris' regal air, though. 
~ Yaaaaay for Lupin! There's big huge rumors going around now that Lupin was in love with Lily Potter. Oh, the wonders of taking liberties with scripts. It's great. Anyway, I was dead set on not liking Lupin OR Sirius, but I found I really, really liked Lupin and
~I got used to Sirius. He went too quickly, in my opinion, from raving lunatic to not so much a raving lunatic. But overall, I liked him. 
~It was funny!! Everything felt much more natural in terms of humor and expression. A majority of this humor came from Ron, who is becoming a very talented comedic actor. 
~ Snape was all protector-like and shit. It was strange, but kind of cool to see him placing himself before the students. I liked the scene where he tells the kids to turn to page ""Three hundred and ninety ffffffffffour."" heheh. 
~Malfoy is so very much in character. I love when he sizes Harry up before faking him out with a Dementor scare. So Draco. So awesome. 
~LOTS of Hermione and Ron sekshull tension scenes. This is ii. It was one thing I didn't mind them hyping up way more than the book did. lol. The more the better, in my opinion. 

THINGS THAT SUCKED: 
~ Okay. I had a major problem with how they characterized Ron and Hermione. They wrote the both of them very one dimensionally. Ron was used for little else than comic relief and he was entirely too cowardly for his character. Go back and read the books, guys...Ron is like, the first person to put his own safety before Harry's and Hermione's (he changed a bit in book five, though, i'll admit). And Hermione is not this badassed overachiever...overachiever, yes, and a key figure in the crucial bits of plot, yes. But Hermione lacks her insecurities and the loads of stress that she's under for a majority of the book. Instead she's this powerhouse girl who has everything under control at every point and time. Which is okay, but it's not the Hermione that JK Rowling created. There's a difference between a bitch slap and a punch, guys. And I didn't like how Hermione seemed to dominate every shot she was in. =/ I dunno, it irked me. 
~ I also didn't like how they left out ALL of the Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs backstory. 
~ The ending was ghey. Totally ghey. 
There, I'm done bitching and reminding everyone how much of a psycho i am. </lj-cut>
~I LOVED LOVED LOVED seeing Maiko-chan, Terri-chama, and Chris-kun on Saturday. =) It was soooo awesome. I've missed them all very terribly. 
~Ditto for Keito-chama and Steve-kun, both of whom I've talked to recently. Steve's the luckiest bastard in the world for getting to see Tokyo. ;) And I miss my Keito-chama like. whoa. We had a good chat on the phone the other day, though. =) 
~I may have a job! Forty hours a week at walmart. ...It's money, I suppose. lol. 
~ MB sucks some serious dick. I haven't the time or energy to rant about it now, though. 

okay, no more typing for me. owari."

~It's cold in New Hampshire. Very cold.
~Want coffee. 
~Saw Shrek 2 as well. It was cute. Not what I expected, but okay. 
~Helped out backstage at my sisters' recital on Sunday. Hell on Earth. Barely survived. Never want kids. 
~Currently reading: Lightning by Dean Koontz. I heart Dean Koontz. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it. 
~Harry Potter dinner/movie in four days! 
~Contemplated becoming a hooker for approximately three seconds in sheer desperation only common to poor people. Wave of hysteria thankfully passed before any venereal diseases could be caught. 
~Siblings driving me crazy. 
~Still want coffee. 
~Worried about intermediate Spanish in the fall. Should probably begin review-like things.

I'm finally going to get to watch Lost in Translation! I'm practically the only person I know who hasn't watched that damn movie yet. I think that will be tonight's plans. 

And I kind of really wish that the weather would turn...but apparently it's supposed to be crappy five out of seven days this week. -_- Booooo. I'm actually quite cold right now.

I cleaned the house like a mofo today. It was crazy. The house looks pretty damn good. I also had a good chat with Jen, which was very ii. It was nice catching up with her, and I'm glad we haven't lost touch. 

Last night I went to Barnes and Noble with Sam and we just got coffee, sat, talked, and putted around the store--high on my list of favorite summer activities. 

All right, seeing as how it's only two weeks away from today, I'm putting out the call now: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban viewing-gathering-type-thing. Who wants to accompany me on opening day or the following day? Dinner before/after?"

Vacation is going fairly well, for the most part. My Mom has been avid about going places, shopping, etc, so I've been occupied. I got my hair cut! There aren't any layers anymore, and I don't know how I feel about that. I'm so anal about my frickin' hair. 

Bailey is so effing hilarious. We were at the mall, and my Mom went to go look in Noah's--a store that sells collectibles. Five year olds and stores with breakable stuff don't really mesh, so I took her to Express instead. We went around looking at clothes, and she was like my very own personal shopper:

Me: Bailey, what do you think of this shirt?
Bailey: Nah, that wouldn't look good on you. 
Me: Okay, how about this? This is cute!
Bailey: Oh, PERFECT! But you need more pink. Get more pink. 
Me: Oo, what about this?
Bailey: Uhh, I'd try that on first if I were you. 

And then we were discussing where to find Mom. 

Me: Noah's is this way, Bailey.
Bailey: No, Momma went THIS way. 
Me: No, I'm pretty sure she went this way. 
Bailey: Dude, have you even BEEN in this mall? 

Sometimes I can't believe that kid is only five. 

I'm anxious to get back to fencing. I *really* want to practice...I'm pretty psyched about nationals, actually. 

The Etch-A-Sketch (also known as: The Family Computer) has been giving me problems lately with viruses and adware/spyware and all sorts of fun stuff. I couldn't use internet explorer for a few days because of some stupid trojan. Oh, and I might not have internet access when I get back up to school because of the Nachi virus that I may have picked up--awesome. Jesus Christ, it's like a fucking compy epidemic. 20 cc's laticane on the rapid infuser! Too...much...ER...

I'm not working until Thursday now. YEAH not getting paid. Ah well. Thursday will shape up to be a good day, though."

Some examples of the Goddess Form are Gaia (Greek),<br>Jehova (Christian), and  Brahma (Indian).
The Goddess is associated with the concept of<br>creation, the number 1, and the element of<br>earth.
Her sign is the dawn sun.

As a member of Form 1, you are a charismatic<br>individual and people are drawn to you.<br>Although sometimes you may seem emotionally<br>distant, you are deeply in tune with other<br>people's feelings and have tremendous empathy.<br>Sometimes you have a tendency to neglect your<br>own self.  Goddesses are the best friends to<br>have because they're always willing to help.

"event","My weekend since I got dropped off at my house on Saturday afternoon hasn't exactly been the best of times. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but it's obviously something rather substantial (okay, I'm lying. I know perfectly well what is wrong, but it's not for broadcast on a livejournal. gomen ne.). I think I teetered on the edge of a mini nervous breakdown, seeing as how I would almost cry (or in some cases, go right ahead and do it) in public places like church and my job. 

I've worked through it, in a fashion. I still don't feel terribly great, but at least I've collected myself and have stopped acting like a psychopathic lunatic. I need to get my shit together, though. =/

And insomnia kicked my ass again last night. I was really really tired too, so it's strange that I couldn't fall asleep. 

On a good and unrelated note, I finished Wolves of the Calla. I won't give away anything, but there was a part that actually made me laugh quite hysterically(one of the few things that did make me laugh, yesterday). A shiny quarter and a Pop Tart to anyone who can guess what could POSSIBLY be in a Stephen King book to make me laugh that hard. (Anyone who has read Wolves of the Calla forfeits Sorry. That'd be like...cheating!) 

No work again for me today. No money again for me today. Su-prise."

I'm almost finished Wolves of the Calla, too, and I have a feeling I'm going to be extraordinarily unsatisfied with how it ends. DAMN these damn series!! Why is everything I get interested in a damn seven book/three movie saga? I can't take the waiting!!! 

Hopefully I can hang out with Sammy tonight because I won't be around tomorrow night, and Saturday I'm working until nine thirty. =P Poo."

I'm going to do so much nothing, it isn't even FUNNY. Oh, and for the record...I am officially dirt. poor. Well...sort of. I'm hell bent on not depositing any checks until I go back to school so I won't be tempted to compulsively spend the money, as I am so very prone to doing. Lol, of course, that means I have probably about...oh...two dollars in my account now. heh. 

I had a very funny conversation with Steve and Mike last night. I hope I didn't scare any outside parties. lol."

I just wanted that in my journal. yeah. =D 


Nothing too meaningful or exciting to say, seeing as how I've spent all weekend at my job. Next week should liven up a bit, though. At least, you know, that's what I'm hoping."

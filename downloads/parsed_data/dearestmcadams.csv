When you're hot you're hot
And when enough is enough
Do the fakers drop out?
Promise me
You will always be
Too awake to be famous
Too wired to be safe
But all you really wanted 
Was everything
Plus everything
And the truth 
I only poured you
Half a line 

Carry on
It's a marathon
Take me off the list
I don't want to be missed
Carrion
Its what we all become
From small minds and tall trees
Away from the action
But all you ever wanted
Was everything
And everything
Plus the truth 
I only poured you
Half alive
Half alive


I only poured you half a lie

-also a side effect to the plastic research writing performance is an insatiable desire to rock and be rocked. 

-my head is okay for now. who knows what tomorrow brings. i like to think i'm healing, or being healed.

my itunes library is currently providing my inspiration. I came across a playlist the danny (rodriguez) made for my first night back in SD after Boston. I remember mack, jenny, efrem, fay, danny and i were all drunk off wine and i was excited about all the new music i had accumulated on this ""porn machine"" that was new at the time. I was pretty jazzed about such things as Wolf Parade, Cat Power, Regina Spektor, The Silver Jews and most of all fucking Pavement. And really that's all I can say about Pavement these days. That it needs a mighty and smiling profanity to do it justice. And even then it doesn't communicate the extraordinary magnificence...fuck, no not even magnificence, this isn't grandiose, this isn't classically appealing, this is fucking ART. Beautiful with a zillion facets, a giant prism reigning pristine over the soundscape. I recall Trevor, my fateful carpool confidant, putting in what he said was a cassette tape from ninth grade, and hearing ""conduit for sale!"" and having spiral (2nd disk of slanted, so stephen's not doing the tryin, if i remember correctly) in my head for hours. I liked it alot, and i probably asked him what it was and vowed to remember, but, naturally, i forgot and stephen, spiral, bob, steve and mark were awash in my slushy brain. And so they sat, untouched, and while i crammed my head with electronic counterpoint and obtuse and friendly rhythms, the enticing musical constructs of dearest Pavement were forgotten. Forgotten until a fateful day when, chuffeuring still my game, i stopped by San Diego's finest, m-theory records, for Danny to shop for his brother's birthday. He picked up Pavement's Terror Twilight album. I took notice, and a few days later, reinvigorated with Pavement cravings, I went searching. Terror Twilight was all I could find, so I bought it. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but there was something missing. It was the band apart from Stephen Malkmus, even though he is a gem, he forgot that there were others involved in the musical musings. Terror Twilight is Stephen's record, and it's good, but his solo career is supposed to come later. So I meet Max Cohen, Pavement enthusiast, and endearing jew. He reunites me with Slanted and Enchanted, and the rest is history."

""I won't write my poem until I'm in my right mind""

And if yr always in the right mind to write poetry, there is certainly something dire and consequential happening. So write. So absorb. So go on and on and on and on. Lost in mixed-up confusion and sex and inebriation and plans and expectations and severe disappointment."

------------------------------------------------------
Back then I had a Buckingham rabbit. 
I'd been lonely since she found Christ. 
Now is the time to depend on the law: 
the nights of my professional life.

I was living in a very young city. 
Grand piano, great lakes, good-bye. 
If you ask me my name, it's high-low-jack in the game. 
I can track a single bee to the hive. 

Every single game was a blowout. 
And the Nascar blurred into porn. 
Scenic this, scenic that, 
don't fall for the traps of the man who was never born. 

And so the rent became whiskey, 
and then my life became risky: 
shattered dogs on the rocks. 

At the back of the bar there's a couch 
where the lonely people go and lie. 
They talk to the honky tonk psychiatrist 
into the wee hours of the night. 

The factories on muscle relaxers. 
The pine perfume of hilltown floors. 
The lover, the thinker, the talker, the singer 
won't be lucid for her anymore. 

(chorus) 

When you know how I feel I feel better 
When you're 15 you want to look poor. 
Do unto others, and run like a mother 
I don't want to look poor anymore 

Jesus in a runaway shelter, 
said ""The deaf have pictures of you."" 
From the digital fountains to the analog mountains, 
let the mirrow express the room.

Emerson is a haven for inebriated leftist nazis who have no shred of human decency. Yes, the war needs to end immediately, but don't shit on my face, cause I'm doing all that I can. I also do not have a pocket Moleskin notebook in which to check off indie bands I've seen live. Call me crazy but usually I just get that tatooed right onto the ol' ass. Teach me some Art, or Aart or Faart, oh please! Oh please! Ladies and sods of the professional persuasion! Which is what I assume you are when I so coyly and astutely address you as ""Professor"". A couple are spared, but these, lesbians and gentlemen, are evasive and limited in number. And so in an attempt to distract from the desolate, I'll consume things that likely shouldn't be consumed, at least not so regularly. An addiction is a drag. Kind of like when yr swimming and you taste the chlorine. You know it'll turn yr hair green."

"event","I know a boy named Jimmy. I like him. He quotes nietzsche, because he's really disarming. His charm is known throughout all the lands of the world. He has the prettiest face one could ever imagine, like a princess. He is the best penguin that ever lived. So I do him. Es de Mexico.

I know a boy named Roberto. He has a voice like an angel, or the first snowflake of the season. We have some good times, and we have some bad times. But through it all, we have times. He's a misogynist, and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

I know a boy named Max. He's lovely. He is the best guitar player in the entire world. Ever. Sometimes he drinks, sometimes he drinks. Sometimes we travel to the moon.

I know some girls named Bridget and Lucy, they are like roses in a bed of rainbows. Lucy is the indie-cool queen. Bridget has a heart that is gold plated emotion and sugar and tits of steel. They are the most beautiful women in the world."

Nothing wrong with that....I am not too big of a fan of technology though, it's a loveless and cold regime. Alright anyway there are some pictures of me and my friends from Emerson on there and some of New York City. I like them and would like to share them. Indulge me."

"event","Hello, my name is Danielle McAdams and I enjoy sleeping through class. I also enjoy foul liquor, and vomiting in trash cans. Occasionally I enjoy walking into the wrong classroom during a lecture, garnering incredulous stares, and referencing uninteresting trivia. At times I enjoy not completing assignments, having weird hair, falling on my face and being indifferent. I am not smart, interesting, attractive or unique. I like to witness the remorse of my professors when I enter a classroom, and the glee which they display at my departure. Their puzzled expressions at my allusions and ""insight"" also do the trick. Additionally, I am particularly fond of perpetual fatigue.

I might be living in a dormitory specifically designed for writers and other literary kids. I am planning visits for the (few) important people in my life. And best of all: I no longer am the victim of my parent's complaints, dogma, restrictions, power trips, and other aspects of suburban totalitarianism. Fucking. Hell. Yes.

America two dollars and twenty-seven cents January 17, 1956. 
I can't stand my own mind. 
America when will we end the human war? 
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb 
I don't feel good don't bother me. 
I won't write my poem till I'm in my right mind. 
America when will you be angelic? 
When will you take off your clothes? 
When will you look at yourself through the grave? 
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites? 
America why are your libraries full of tears? 
America when will you send your eggs to India? 
I'm sick of your insane demands. 
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks? 
America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world. 
Your machinery is too much for me. 
You made me want to be a saint. 
There must be some other way to settle this argument. 
Burroughs is in Tangiers I don't think he'll come back it's sinister. 
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke? 
I'm trying to come to the point. 
I refuse to give up my obsession. 
America stop pushing I know what I'm doing. 
America the plum blossoms are falling. 
I haven't read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for 
murder. 
America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies. 
America I used to be a communist when I was a kid and I'm not sorry. 
I smoke marijuana every chance I get. 
I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet. 
When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid. 
My mind is made up there's going to be trouble. 
You should have seen me reading Marx. 
My psychoanalyst thinks I'm perfectly right. 
I won't say the Lord's Prayer. 
I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations. 
America I still haven't told you what you did to Uncle Max after he came over 
from Russia.

I'm addressing you. 
Are you going to let our emotional life be run by Time Magazine? 
I'm obsessed by Time Magazine. 
I read it every week. 
Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore. 
I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library. 
It's always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious. Movie 
producers are serious. Everybody's serious but me. 
It occurs to me that I am America. 
I am talking to myself again.

Asia is rising against me. 
I haven't got a chinaman's chance. 
I'd better consider my national resources. 
My national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals 
an unpublishable private literature that goes 1400 miles and hour and 
twentyfivethousand mental institutions. 
I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underpriviliged who live in 
my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns. 
I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go. 
My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I'm a Catholic.

America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood? 
I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as individual as his 
automobiles more so they're all different sexes 
America I will sell you strophes $2500 apiece $500 down on your old strophe 
America free Tom Mooney 
America save the Spanish Loyalists 
America Sacco Vanzetti must not die 
America I am the Scottsboro boys. 
America when I was seven momma took me to Communist Cell meetings they 
sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a nickel and the 
speeches were free everybody was angelic and sentimental about the 
workers it was all so sincere you have no idea what a good thing the party 
was in 1935 Scott Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother 
Bloor made me cry I once saw Israel Amter plain. Everybody must have
been a spy. 
America you don're really want to go to war. 
America it's them bad Russians. 
Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians. 
The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia's power mad. She wants to take 
our cars from out our garages. 
Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Reader's Digest. her wants our 
auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations. 
That no good. Ugh. Him makes Indians learn read. Him need big black niggers. 
Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help. 
America this is quite serious. 
America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set. 
America is this correct? 
I'd better get right down to the job. 
It's true I don't want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts 
factories, I'm nearsighted and psychopathic anyway. 
America I'm putting my queer shoulder to the wheel."

I went to LA for three days for a seminar on ""writing for stage, page and screen."" If anyone's ever seen Adaptation, I went to the class that Donald Kaufman goes to and then convinces Charlie to go along. This McKee cat's a fucking gem. What passion! What insight! What ennui wrapped in the arms of sarcastic bitching and profanity! And somehow he managed to put a lot of the aspects of life in humbling perspective for many of his students. A delightful man to say the least.

On another note, I read Candide by Voltaire and found it a magnificent satire. Anything dripping with that much coincidence, absurdity and anti-structure to comment on this ethos-deprived beast we call humanity is my kind of read.

And to close: If libraries were not the gracious and docile institutions of complacent old ladies, their army would have me stretched and quartered due to extraordinary fines. Good thing the blue-hairs are their ruling class. Cheers."

I mean not just melancholy, but honestly shaking and in such a state of despair that they cannot really walk or breathe or talk or do virtually anything at all?

I had the most peculiar onrush of maternal instincts in my TOK class on Friday. It was so strange. It kind of just reverberated inside my body for a while as Mayfield spewed his spit on ""What Can We Really Know About History?"" (on a side note, the lesson went something like this: (after a Genghis Khan reference) Efrem: ""You say there's no true historical fact, but yet you're using historical facts to justify your points..."" Mayfield:""Yeah, there is evil in the world right? Yeah!"" Efrem:(looks at Danielle, whispers) ""What...I?!"")

So I think this feeling has something to do with a dream I had in which I was pregnant and at an Old West theme park. I was worried everyone would be weird/mad/sad about it, but SURPRISE they were all really happy for me. Trevor Danny and Chris said: ""Oh look it's Danielle ooooooooh how far along is she? oooh 6 months yeah, that's great."" How feminine of them.Precious.

Efrem Carlin is a wonderful kid. We spent Friday hunting down poetry, but turns out the venue was under construction due to its being dilapidated. So we tried to play chess at Claire de Lune, but unfortunately it went a little something like this: me: (makes move) Efrem: ""Rooks don't jump Danielle"" me: ""oh. damn."" We also went downtown and talked about robots, violence and shakespeare. We concluded our party with the first line and/or verses of just about every Dylan song of the sixties. Too bad the second verses are so damn fleeting. I have to read a lot of books to catch up to that one. I need to live some more and catch up to that one.

In other news, I am in creative writing now, and I ""shared"" on Friday and realized that reading my own poetry aloud is just about the most nerve wracking experience ever. I think my face went red and my voice was shaking. Funny how I can run around talking about being held at ""pencil point"" and screaming Carly Simon songs onstage but reading something in class is just too much. Very logical, universe, thanks baby.
A girl in the class said what I read that day was her favorite thing she had heard in the class so far, and a couple of other kids were asking me questions about its symbolism and meaning. Isn't that nice? It made my day.

I wrote this thinking I would be covering more days than simply Friday. Seems I thought wrong judging on the presence of the ""on Friday""s that lurk around every corner. Whatever. 

Whatever is the most ambiguous and appropriate word in the world, dammit. People need to stop abusing it."

So sorry to those I punched, kicked, beat up, insulted, befuddled, irritated, perturbed or did something lewd in front of.

However, because of Pokez' laughable service Fay and I weren't able to make it to the museum in time. So we decide to get our portraits drawn by a precious old man who's advertisement was ""Portraits, donations only"" which he quickly clarifies to mean a minimum of ten dollars. Fay sits. The man draws. He's a complete loon. He keeps asking me to find the green. There is no green, I tell him. He proceeds to rant about Fay Wray, who apparently was oriental. Good. Glad that's cleared up. He tells us he's british, and indeed has an accent. We believe him. My turn. It's getting dark. He tells me I look like princess ""Diane"". He asks us to move under a lantern in the park. We consent. I sit back down, he takes up his charcoal again, while fay moves all his things. He yells at her about the easel. Apparently she wasn't screwing in the leg, ""Darling the leg THE LEG"". He tells me I have ""scandinavian beauty"", then goes off about how he could draw ""mickey mouse"" portraits and make a lot of money, but he does these because they are ""quality"", and because he ""falls in love with whatever he's drawing"". I am not scandinavian. The picture's done. It doesn't look like us."

<P class=MsoNormal style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">There was a poetry drill today; organized in part by the Coronado High (silly kids thought it was a fire drill) and in part by Allen Ginsberg, Efrem and myself. It consisted of me wailing through various poems from a book entitled ""Poets of the Beat Generation"" which I am going to steal. There's a really nice sampling of all the fifties kings in that book (delicious) and some really good photographs. There were only three women mentioned, which made me wonder if the photo that I saw with the sign ""welcome girls of the Beat Generation"" (at some sort of reading/party/drinking excuse) was in vain. I think it just meant the willing lays, not the poets or brains that happened to be women. I would have been content to be associated with either group, BUT as one Izzo says ""The only time is the 2005.""

and I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy, 
where is your famous golden touch?"" 
I thought you knew where 
all of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 
Just take a look at your body now, 
there's nothing much to save 
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave."" 
Now if you can manage to get 
your trembling fingers to behave, 
why don't you try unwrapping 
a stainless steel razor blade? 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 
There's no hot water 
and the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
the kind of places you've been living in? 
Don't drink from that cup, 
it's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
that is your vision growing dim. 
Cover up your face with soap, there, 
now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
who will give you his applause. 
I thought you were a racing man, 
ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
and it's stopping at your face. 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
ah wasn't it a strange way down? 

Once there was a path 
and a girl with chestnut hair, 
and you passed the summers 
picking all of the berries that grew there; 
there were times she was a woman, 
oh, there were times she was just a child, 
and you held her in the shadows 
where the raspberries grow wild. 
And you climbed the twilight mountains 
and you sang about the view, 
and everywhere that you wandered 
love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
yes it makes you clench your fist. 
And then the veins stand out like highways, 
all along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 

You can still find a job, 
go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
there are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
they can give you back your hope, 
you can find your love with diagrams 
on a plain brown envelope. 
But you've used up all your coupons 
except the one that seems 
to be written on your wrist 
along with several thousand dreams. 
Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
that's a razor in his mit; 
and he puts on his dark glasses 
and he shows you where to hit; 
and then the cameras pan, 
the stand in stunt man, 
dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just the dress rehearsal rag, 
you know this dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just a dress rehearsal rag."

It's a universal undercurrent in all youth especially, and I like to appease it and indulge in a bit of violence and vice every now and again. I think it's healthy; when it comes and goes. But when it spends night after night with you, coming more often and staying longer, that's when you begin to think: is it really just some darkness, some erebus of the psyche that beckons your exploration periodically, some charming tryst with crude sin? or is it a delight that happily shares a bed with you forever?"

"event","Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain, there was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived, their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world, obscured as it was by great clouds. Here they played out their peaceful lives,innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below. To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough. Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town. They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them: they only saw shadows. You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind.

Falling out of airplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody's dancing the dance of the dead,
the dance of the dead,
the dance of the dead

In time, Strangefolk found their way into the high reaches of the mountain, and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty. By chance, they stumbled upon the Place Where All Good Souls Come to Rest. The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things, and soon they began to mine the mountain, its rich steam fueling the chaos of their own world. Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly, their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls. Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain. Why was it bringing darkness into their lives? And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear, bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of them up. For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the Monkey would soon stir from its deep sleep.
And then came a sound. Distant first, it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space. There were no screams. There was no time. The mountain called Monkey had spoken. There was only fire. And then, nothing.

O little town in U.S.A, your time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want 
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me now?"

I'll give you a clue, God, Mom, Gram, Dad. The other four, well, its almost positive that they are not you. I'm so aggrivated. I'm so vulnerable. Little things annoy me anymore. Its not one big picture. Its a bunch of scattered frames. For instance, how DC's new song is on the radio and everyone is obsessed with it. Fuck off bitches, I'm the true fan. How when I talk to people their words turn to bullets and everyone is starving for attention. Our lips are dry and our eyes are small. Its time we grow up and move on. You know, stop relying on each other. If that classifies me as being a mean cold hearted bitch, yeah. I'll deal. I""m fine with that. How I'm failing all my classes. How I can stand anyone. Even what use to be my closest friends. I need my freedom. I need time by myself. I like me. I don't like me. I like me better than you."

For everyone around me is just as alone.
I spend most of my time in front of this death trap of entertainment, wasting my life away. Its really quite depressing. As time goes by, I often say how I don't want to get married and relationships are not for me. Well part of me still believes that but the other part of me [my human nature I suppose] wants someone to spend my time with.

I'm pathetic. Still. Typing my life away on livejournal.
Giving me another excuse to escape from reality."

They could not be anymore incorrect. I've decided to distance myself. Do not call me. Do not message me. If I message you then you know that I want you in my life. If not, it means you've hurt me. I have to protect myself if I want to survive this. Most of all, do not pretend things are fine. I'm sick of the lying. Its ridiculous. 

I have no need to describe the situation. I have no need to spread it anymore. I want to keep the people who love me and move on from the ones who use me. That is all.

On a happy note, my parents gave me an early birthday gift :] The clarinet that I've wanted [and needed]. For clarinet players, its an R13 Buffet Professional pure wood clarinet. Its wonderful. I could not have expected anything better. Back to practicing like crazy I suppose. Haha.

Thats all I really have to say.
I can honestly quit all of this knowing that I tried my best.
So indeed I will."

If you have that much of a fucking problem with me stop throwing your damn pity parties and leave me. Thats the best damn advice I can give you. So go ahead, make your little get away. My pride will keep me company. And you just gave yours all away.

I thought I was being a good person. I was there for the downs. I was there for the laughs. I paused my life to help. I guess its not good enough. Nothing will ever be good enough. Not when it comes from me. Its my fault. Its always my fault.

God bless the people who still love me. I'll give them all the love in the world. They try to help, they understand.

My sentences are choppy. I feel like crying. I feel like punching and screaming. I can feel myself dying though. I miss.

"event","OK. So I've been in lock down in my room for the past two and a half days. Why? I'm fucking sick. The kind of sick that is strong enough just to make getting back on the life track hard. Although, I do enjoy getting to sleep in. Playing melee all day. Getting caught up in the ""outside of school"" life. So it is enjoyable in a way. Excluding the throwing up and body aches. Oh well. Take the good and the bad. 

Lately I've been so unproductive. I really don't do anything. I can't even blame it on my illness because this has been going on way before that. I don't seem to practice my clarinet, do my homework, go to meetings, pay attention in class. It doesn't feel like I do anything anymore besides daydream of sleep. I'm open to suggestions to get rid of my laziness."

School today. I mean it was alright. I had to make up a shit load of work. Oh well. Lately I have no desire to do anything besides sleep. Not even read. So I was in geometry today and I started to scribble in my notebook. I knew I needed to pay attention. I needed to. But I found scribbling and creating a tiny piece of art so much more important. That made me feel pretty pathetic. Anyways. 

Something thats been bothering me is the constant happening of lost identities. Its quite annoying thinking I know someone entirely, blink, then have them completly change their morals and personality in a split second. Fuck them. Fuck them for going with a fad. I think I'm pretty strong with who I am. But damn. It seems like they have no clue who they are. As if they have wasted the first 15-16 years of their life not learning who they were. Anyways.

Lately I've been writing a book in my mind. Kind of like an autobiography. But I hear the words as if I'm reading a book. Its weird. Oh well, it keeps me occupied. Anyways.

I haven't been practicing my clarinet lately. Its actually upsetting me that I don't have the motivation to practice anymore. The time actually. Teachers obviously don't realize that I dont' care about exponents but rather music so they constantly pile on a fuckload of homework leaving me no decent time for my passion. Bitches. The End."

Lets just say we hate laurel mall now <.< So in a defeated attempt we headed back to her house. Ate some junkfood and played video games. It doesn't get better ^_^ A couple hours later a few more friends came over. It made me feel great. Having the old group together. In harmony :] We did the usual, talked, played some soul calibur, play truth or dare jenga, and moods. Ugh, it was just wonderful :] It makes me miss last year though. That was an every weekend thing for the group. Oh well, I have a feeling we'll get back into making that a routine. Time flew, it was time to go home before I even knew it. Lets just say parents know how to ruin an awesome day though <.< So I got home, did the usual talk on AIM deal. Went to sleep. Rah, I can't explain how happy I am right now.

"event","Things are not working out in my life. This week has topped all ""bad weeks"" I've had. As we all know though, things never go as planned. Obviously things didn't go well at the beginning of the week. Actually, it crushed me. I know I exaggerate too much and you can never tell when things really do hurt me. But, honestly this <i>crushed</i> me. It tore me apart inside and out and still has not left my mind. It's getting easier but I still feel as though it took part of my heart with it. So with that being the first layer of my problems, it still builds. I also feel like 90% of my friends secretly despise me. Worse yet, I feel as though some of them have replaced me. I long to talk to them about it but I feel as though it is not my place. Because yet again, they are happy and I am this miserable person. It's not fair to them. Thats the second layer. The third layer that just hit me today. Someone who's opinion I regard highly told me I may not be able to succeed my dream. That was the thing that broke me. Having someone <i>practically</i> tell me that I won't be able to be apart of a symphony someday is possibly the worst thing ever. Because even though my friends may not be there, even if I never get married, even if nothing else works out, I thought I always had music. I still love music. I love it with all my heart. Now I just don't know what to do with it. I had my life planned out. I knew where I wanted to go to college, I knew I wanted to be apart of a symphony, I knew what I wanted and I knew I could make it. But having a musician tell me ""it may not be for some people"" [hinting] was so breaking. During band we were playing the second movement of this amazing Granger piece named Lincolnshire Posy. Don't qoute me on the spelling. Anyways, it is such an emotional piece. Something you have to pour your soul into to make it sound amazing. And it hit me around the tenth measure; What if I never get to do this? Besides highschool band what if I never get to play with a symphony? What if they were right? That all hit me in a matter of seconds. I started to cry. I had to snap out of it though knowing that my teacher usually looks in my direction to cue me during that song. It hurt so bad. It hurt in my heart knowing that the one thing I thought I had forever might not always be there. One more thing, I'm so depressing. I can't stand myself. I try so hard during the day to make myself happy. I try so so hard. Nothing works anymore.

To wrap this up, this week was terrible. I've mentioned most of this stuff before and I feel like I am continually repeating myself in my journal entries. Its pathetic of me to wallow in these moments when I know deep down there is so much to live for. I'm trying to get over this but I gave my heart to everyone and everything. Everyone seemed to hand it back in shredded pieces. While we are on that analogy, a wind blew those pieces away. I'm ready to start picking the pieces back up but they are scattered everywhere. Hidden. Its going to take a lot of hard, mental work. A lot of finding myself and what I am going to do with the remainder of my life. I know some will help me pick up. Some I'll push away. It will hurt but for the sake of me I will have to.

Please stay away from me. I hurt everyone I'm around. I think its best for me to just focus on my music and try to talk to as little people as possible. I get hurt. You get hurt. We get hurt.

It's not worth it.

imaginary friends that always knew one day I'd leave for good.
I'll give away this girl who tried to make you fall in love,
I'll give her to you so keep her close to you.
So you won't forget about how she loved you so long ago once upon a time.
Now she has grown up, and you can't take it back

A lullaby won't change my mind, and I won't ever go back to that.
I will stay true to this belief that we've changed for the best through this.

Separate the ones who know you
from the ones who couldn't bother to see you for all that you are.

it was just an easy answer, It was make believe,
but I still believe that this heart will learn to love.

Do you see those lyrics? Those mean so much to me right now. Today sucked. I'm not going to lie. It was really hard for me just to keep my head up and look into the eyes of someone else. It wasn't all terrible though. Like I said, this is going to be a difficult process for me. Considering I don't remember much of today, that's all I can write for the earlier part. It's hard to explain how one can forget that, anyways, I was recently just lying in my bed listening to my normal John Mayer. As I have for the past seven days or so. I felt that heavy feeling again. As I've described before. That heavy feeling on my chest and in my mind. I had to move. I'm so tired but I can't sleep. So I got up and got my ipod. You know maybe to listen to something else. I clicked it on shuffle and that song came on. I found it to be very coincidental. The thing that amazes me though just hearing that piano and that calming voice made me feel so much better. I'm not saying thats going to cover my damage like one huge band-aid but for right now we will call music the vitamins that help along the way. I'm reaching out for something. Something along the lines of hope that I can get out of this. That I can move on and be completly happy again. It seems like music is the only hand reaching back to help. And as easily as my wanting to write down my thoughts came, its now gone. I'm starting to feel sleep come. I might be back. It depends how soon my mind gets exhausted. It seems like it never sleeps anymore.

Anyways. I believe I wrote my other entry far too early. For shortly after posting it I discovered information that tears at my heart. I feel this incredible ache in my chest. I'm positive it's not a heart attack [althought it might be a good possibility with all this excess fat on my body] but rather heartbreak. I know I'm not the only person in the world to feel it. I know for sure I'm not the last. God, it feels terrible. It's probably the worst pain I've ever felt. Constantly on my mind. Constantly in my dreams. Constantly keeping me from sleep and disabling my happy life. Listen to how pathetic I sound! I hate the way I sound. I truely and honestly hate myself right now. I'm such a downer. I'm so fucking depressed though, I don't know where else to go. I can't explain any of this to my three bests. For I will bring them down as well. I can't do that. I can't. They are all so happy. It is not right or is it fair of me to burden them. I don't know where else to go. I really don't. Right here is the only place I have left. I want to know whats going on in the lives around me but I'm in paralyzing fear that I'll hurt myself again. So I've been sitting in my room for the past five days. Moving from my bed to the computer chair. Staring at this moniter like it is my only companion. It watches me cry, it watches me waste my life away right here. I've become so much of a different person in five days. I'm not looking forward to morning. I'm not looking forward to daytime. I'm not even looking forward to sleep! Sleep has become a false hope for escaping my thoughts. As far as I'm concerned I just want to stay here. I never want to see another human as long as I live. Everytime I get close, I get hurt. I'm idiotic enough to think it will never happen again. I use to feel bad for people who looked so lonely. So hollow on the inside. Not just the normal unhappy person, but the people that when you look into their eyes you see a soul. But you see no life. I'm understanding now how they got to that point. Whenever something bad happens, or rather, something unplanned happens, a little token of your emotion gets taken away. You feel a little more numb. A little more unwelcoming. I'm starting to understand. 

And as much as I just wrote. And as much as I poured my soul out. I'm going to have to suck it up. I'm going to have to take one huge step and learn to move on. Because if I want to see the people around me happy, I have to be happy too. It will take me a good few months but I'll be alright. I hope."

Let alone be around them in person. But weirdest of all, I turn to photography. It makes me so happy to go outside and snap a shot of a tree. To find the perfect angle that the sun shines through its branches. Giving it light. Giving it warmth. Giving it that staple it needs for life. Just to see how blue the sky is, to see the green, fresh generation of grass that is arising from the dying snow, it makes me feel like things will be alright for the time that I'm out there. To see that nature is going through its shedding of winter. It makes me feel like I can also get rid of my ""old skin"". I'm not the most outdoor-sy person either. Trust me. Most of the time I'd rather watch Laguna Beach [sarcasm if you can't pick it up] than go outside. But it's beautiful. It makes me feel whole. Although, nature is cruel. For I can't take that happiness inside with me. It has to stay out there. It's alright though. In time things will be alright. The ground is living proof. It will get rid of the cold that consumes its entire soul. It will feel warm and new again. In time.

<i>I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it wont all go the way
It should
But I know the heart of life is good

You know it's nothin new
Bad news never had good timing
Then the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who is
Misunderstood
But the heart of life is good
I know its good, i know its good
Oh i know its good

Oh I do I do I do

Oh I know its good </i>"

"event","This week sucked. I have no other way to put it. Anything bad that could happen did. I was pretty sad all week and just bad stuff. You know? Anyways I was thinking today, what happens when musical is done? My life right now pretty much revolves around it and I love it. I love every second of it. I get to hang out with friends, I get to play my clarinet for 5 hours straight. Really, it doesn't get better for me. Most of all though, i'm busy. AKA not bored. Apart from generalized stuff, something has been bothering me. Honestly, tearing me apart. To the point of breaking a promise to myself and crying [read last blog]. I just don't have the heart to say anything because the person seems so happy. Truely, I don't want to take that away. It's leaving me numb though.

Also, i'm becoming more anti-social as the days go on. I really don't want to go anywhere. Talk to any. Meet anyone new. I just want to stay home.
I don't know. I'm fairly confused on what to do.

<i>
So we try and try all of our life working
with such pride making cash just to survive
as we race and grade and judge always other folks mistakes
makes us good to feel that way. And don't you know, it never
stops. Try to please the world and beat the ticking clocks, but I,
I'm not letting it happen this time..

No, no. Because they're rooting I'll fail, and rooting she'll bail
they feel so secure when I'm in this jail. But I'm not 
letting it happen this time..

So i'll move to the other side of the block
so we wont ever have to stop making the rounds, having the laughs, singing
the sounds of relaxing, and on the other side
of the clock the power switch will be turned off and all will be well and
time will stand still, and I will be locked out from my jail.<i>"

I'm not bored. I'm not depressed or upset. I'm just content with my life. Really. The great thing is that today was terrible. In every sense that terrible could be taken in. And it will be alright. Because none of that stuff damaged me. The tears that ran down my face today felt warm. Not the cold tears I usually cry. I realized I wasn't crying because I was sad. I was crying because it's become a habit. When something so minor goes wrong I immediately run towards crying. I think I should start viewing life as something beautiful. I'm tired of waking up and not feeling happy. It's a state of mind for me. I need to start thinking that life is wonderful. And it truely is. I just need to learn that things won't always go my way. I guess this is the next movement up.

Today started out amazing. I got my new KRZR and it is the most adorable thing I have ever held in my hands ^_^. Other than that exciting event my day was pretty normal. Boring. And I had my lesson with Miss Sirgey. Fun stuff ^_^

Now, the problem part. Did you ever feel like your friends don't like you? Yeah, well I'm really getting that vibe from some of them. Really. As if they talk about me behind my back. One person especially. I don't know. That's kind of been tearing me up all day. Knowing that the relationship I've had with some people might have been nothing but a short term thing. As days go on in highschool the friend count goes down for me.

"event","I have a real situation to type for tonight. Not just my normal complaining or moping about. Anyways, it's terrible that people don't take action for what they believe in. Example time. I'm sure most of us nowaday have a myspace or something along the lines of one. And I'm sure we've all seen at least one bulletin where the person is asking for your help for a worthy cause. For instance, the one I saw today was to stop animal testing. Which is a great cause and it should be stopped. By all means. But, those who posted it don't seem to understand it. They picked very basic pictures as examples and used meaningless statements. ""This is wrong! Stop animal testing!"". Thats great, but what are those words going to do? Where are the hardcore facts? Also, I'm sure the people who posted that bulletin will really do nothing to stop animal testing. More than likely they hit the ""Post Bulletin"" link, will ponder and be in outrage for the next hour or two, then let it slip their minds. It just confuses me as to how people can let things that bother them slide by. Why not alter your life to help the animals if it means that much to you? I did. It was by far hard. I guess I'm generalizing as to what they are doing after they posted it. If we all took a little more action in our lives this world could be very different.

Besides that current cause, my day went well. Really. Today was just a good day. No problems. Perhaps its because I really didn't do anything or have the need to feel anything today. I either sat at the computer and watched amv/youtube/checked yahoo or I played zelda. Neither takes much thought or emotion. Maybe that and school was cancelled. Along with tomorrow. Oh yeah and tomorrow means I get my new KRZR ^_^ so I'm reaaaally happy. Ok well, I'm losing interest in typing. Bye!

Oh yeah one more update. Remember my 8/08/06 entry? Well, yeah I'm still a strict vegetarian and 90% of my items are not tested on animals. I just thought you should all know that. So I'm not a ""hyprocrit"". ^_^"

Every aspect of it but I'm continually being told how I'm not going to succeed in it. I'm starting to believe it. Also a close friend has fogotten me. Or at least it seems like it. She moved on. She found someone obviously more meaningful to her. I understand though. It's just really starting to hurt. It is no longer I that she messages/texts/calls to talk to. I am merly a means of letting out her frustration nowadays. I will not ask for her to change this though. For she seems so happy. For once in a very long time. That matters more to me than my own happiness. But I suppose thats life. You can only rely on yourself. I feel alone. I feel unloved. I feel worthless. I don't know how else to put it besides the blunt way. I really just want someone to share my time with. It seems like everyone is finding their other half. I just want to share life with a wonderful guy. It seems like that time will never come though. I know how pathetic and how idiotic I sound. I seem like I rely on others but we all have this natural desire to be loved. I guess mine is just really starting to kick in. If only you knew how much time I spend alone though.

Actually I'm not being fully honest. I know exactly why I was in a terrible mood. But I'm not going to tell you. It's my secret. So anyways, after being emo for a while I went over to Rachels. We attempted to get our Tekkoshacon costumes but the st00pid costume store was closed. Eh. We did go back to her house though and watch adorable anime ^_^. Our day was short though. She had crew :[ So I went back to being emo. Really it's old feelings. It really is. I'm not ready to share those feelings yet. I know it sounds lame but I'm just not.

I mean who could ask for more than a cancellation from school. Getting to sleep a few more hours in a nice, warm, [semi] comfy bed? Mmm, it was great. So as soon as I woke up I ate half of a subway sub that was left from the night before. Ok things are still going great! Then I played Zelda Twilight Princess for around 6 hours. I goofed off in Arbiters Grounds. I could have easily finished it today but I decided to enjoy the experience considering I may not play it again. So after a few hours on Zelda I moved to this amazing trauma center game. Anime + Wii + Surgery = one of the best games ever. Seriously. Ok, so Wii wore me out. I decided to take a nap. which lasted until 6 pm. Mmm, a nice nap. I woke up to look that the school has been cancelled yet again. This seemed to be the best day ever. But easy come easy go. After enjoying another subway meal [teeeehe] a friend called. This friend practically ruined my night. Really. She insisted on telling me how spoiled I was and how I appreciate nothing. And it really upset me. I don't think any of you understand. Yes, I am spoiled. I am. But I do not flaunt my luck. I try to act as humble as possible and I think I do a good job. I always, <b>always</b> say thank you when I am given something and I always thank God in my prayers for giving me such a wonderful life. Besides that, it's not like I have always been lucky. Until I was about 10-12 years old my family had nothing. As to the point where we couldn't buy food and my gram had to help us along. We had <i>nothing</i>. We are just very fortunate that my dad found a very good, stable job. But it really upset me. Is that how I am viewed? A heartless being who thrives on materialistic joy? It really ruined my night. On top of that I've been reading around a few of my friends blogs. It seems as though they've forgotten our so called <i>great friendship</i>. As if I was a chapter in a book. They read through the chapter so fast. Oh, it was a great chapter indeed. But like all parts of a book, it comes to an end. And they've moved on to the next. You'll always remember the book but its unlikely you'll read it again. Yet you'll keep the book forever. Tonight has been rough. It really has. I highly doubt any of you care either.

It's just, I'm really upset that summer is over. It has went by way too fast. Sadly the only thing I'm going to miss is sleep. And I think this year is going to be a hell on earth type of experience. I think that my bestfriendship with some people has become nothing more than <b>just</b> a friendship. *Sigh* But I guess it was expected. We've all changed. And as some of us grow up and have dreams, the rest will be left in the shadows of their past. I think highschool is a time for change. This is my stance of who I am. With people trying to be so ""individual"" they have lost tact with themselves. They need to realize that being individual is being yourself. If your inner self likes AE, then buy AE. If your inner self likes The Academy Is,... listen to The Academy Is,...Don't do it just to make a label for yourself. But it's useless trying to explain it to people. They will be what they want. Not what they are. Another thing. You can't change who you are. Even if you want to, and people absolutely hate you for it. You cannot change. You can adapt to be around those people, but please do not state that you have changed. Because I will look at you as a liar. I guess this is my end of summer proclamation. I've become closer to friends, and unfortuneatly barely talk to some of them anymore. I enjoy things the way they are though. I've noticed scenary this summer. How beautiful flowers are. How incredible clouds look against a vibrant sky. I've always loved the stars, but now I can share my love of them with my best friends. I've goofed off, cried, and loved. I've moved on and learned. This summer has been very meaningful to me and I believe it has shaped me into me. I've learned that I can do whatever I want. I've learned that I can discipline myself. I've shared secrets that I thought I would take to the grave with me. And I've over come something that was controlling my life. And now I'm ready to take a step towards my next fault, and fixing it. I could go on and on about how much my summer has changed me. Maybe I'll make a part two later. But for now, I must sleep or eles I will be miserable in the morning."

Gramz and I are tight. So after all that fun stuff we went to Target. I found a shirt, thought to myself how I wanted it. But I knew I couldn't get it. I was there for one thing. The new Hellogoodbye CD. So I darted to electronics. Picked it up. Checked out. My gram then asks if I want starbucks. I did not refuse. Walking out, happy with my new CD my grandma presents me with the shirt I saw earlier. So, now I'm extremley happy. I decide to not listen to my iPod and talk to my Gramz. I was trying to explain to her the genre of HGB. Hah, pretty funny. Anyways We got home and I immediately put it in. Listened to ""touchdown turnaround"". My Gram starts dancing. Hah, and as most of you know, my gram has some pretty cool moves. So she left like five minutes later. Saying thank you and goodbye I walk her out the door. When she left. I became really sad. Not for the fact I was disappointed in the CD, or my shirt didn't work out. I was sad that my gram was gone. What happens when she leaves forever? My grandma is the only one who will listen to me. The only one I can talk to without argueing. We bond so well together. Even though she embarrasses me to death sometimes, I love every moment of it. Because later that day, I get a chance to laugh at what happened. No one else gives me the time of day like my gram. Today's items really hit me. When she is gone, will I cherrish these items more? Because I was able to understand this bond today? And as much as I may talk about how lame some trips are with my gram. I know I will be happy I went. Because time with her is limited. It seems like she will be here forever. But one day, she won't be there. I know a piece of me will die that day as well."

"event","For a long time. I've been a supporter of animal rights. I'm for the fact that they have emotion, they can feel, they can love, and they can suffer. Just like humans. I'm against the way they are raised on farms and are slaughtered. But yet, I am a hypocrit because I continue to eat meat. So I can no longer let myself. I must try to become a vegetarian. Call me a tree hugger. Call me names. But it's something that I believe is right. Someway that I can make a difference for my beliefs. If I fail, then I guess I'll just have to try again. And if it's nearly impossible, I'll have to cut out as much as possible. I guess I'm getting to the age where I am feeling the need to make my own choices. I've been considering this lifestlye since the sixth grade. I believe it is finally time to take a step into it. No, I am not going to become a vegan. I respect the people who can do that, but I am surely not ready for it. The title I am going to accept though, is a lacto-ovo vegetarian. No meat, but dairy products and eggs. If anyone out there who is also trying/is a vegetarian contact me on AIM or something. I'm positive I will need help. AIM; bonjour ashley. Oh, one more thing. I am not going to force my beliefs on you. Just because <b>I</b> want to give up meat, does not mean that I am going to hate you/discriminate against you, just because you do eat meat. Nor am I going to say things while you eat a hamburger or steak. It is simple enough. I will deny the food that I don't want. But please don't feel the need to not eat meat around me. I really won't care. This is my lifestyle. Not yours."

"event","Is it not amazing how as soon as the truth breaks, things become different? Thank God for people in this world who can take it, and give it in return. I wonder why people don't like the truth. Is it because it's what they try to hide deep within themselves? If they cover themselves in lies and false hope, they will become them? I know for myself, it's hard accepting the truth. But I can. It may take me a while. But I can. Hm. It's interesting. Another thing. Music. It's amazing how music can make a person understand. Understand the way the musician wanted it to be expressed. For instance, lately The Rocket Summer has been my band of choice; and I have been crying my eyes out. Just because I understand. And I can feel it. Christmas Present, for one. The guitar at the beginning is so beautiful. And I can listen to that song, ten times in a row, and love it and respect as much as I did the first time I heard it. Most of you probably will never understand that feeling like I do. But we can all love it. We can all feel it. And most of all, we can all relate to it.

""And it's true that, we all wanna be the baddest, we all have a little baggage, even though we hide it and we always will deny it. We are driving this float down main, in this pride parade."""

"event","I'm posting one more entry tonight. I promise this will be the last one for the day.

I think I have an anxiety disorder. I over think everything. Lets use today as an example. I met up with Christian and Andrea at the fair today. The first thing we decided to do was go eat at the Golden Corral (spelling?). Alright. So we go to get into a Van. Not a big deal, for someone normal. But with me, I was nervous about entering the van. I was thinking to myself ""What if there isn't enough room?"" or ""What if my knee's start to hurt?"" (I have a disease in my knee's for those who don't know me well). I successfully make it into the van, buckle in, and we are on our way. Three minutes into the ride, I start to wonder how we are going to exit. Who will leave the seats first? Will I? So once again I get nervous. We exit from the van fine. Go eat. Come back out. Get into the van and drive back. (Same worries, I'm just not retyping them)The first ride we ride; the ferris wheel. I get nervous because, what happens if they don't let all three of us on at one time (which I know now is completely false) and I'm the one who rides alone (that happens to me a lot)? Eh. We all ride together and it was fun. The next ride is a three person ride. Alright. Nothing to worry about. The next. Tilt a Whirl. Once again. Three people can fit. Haunted house after this. Uh oh. only two can ride at a time. I quickly grab Andrea as a partner making me look like one of those annoying friends who needs a partner. Even though in reality I am. Ok it's alright during the ride, you know, I have my partner. I'm fine. The next thing. The Spider. Oh my. I was so nervous about this ride, I lied to my best friends :[. I said I was too afraid to ride that ride. But in reality I love it. But through my mind, some thoughts were; Well Andrea and Christian are partners. I can't ride alone. Maybe they really don't want me to ride. What if I can't get up into the cart? Do I just leave? Can I leave? What if you can't go back and I'm stuck there making a fool of myself?. So I didn't ride it :[. The next rides were all single rides or group rides and I'm not going to continue yammering on. Don't get me wrong, today was incredibly fun. Loads and loads of fun! But I really think there is something wrong with me. I shouldn't worry about that stuff, right? (The fact that I have terrible social skills and awful hearing doesn't help) Maybe it's a self esteem issue. I mean, I probably have the lowest self esteem ever. Or maybe it's an attention thing. But those who know me, know I don't strive for attention. I would really like some help. It's not just the fair. I get nervous over everything. It's annoying. I think this void stops me from being a really fun person. I mean, I'm the one that always thinks things through. So in other words, I'm kind of skipping my worry free teenage years. Please, no one take offense to my thoughts. I know they aren't true. But it's like I'm not myself at moments.

Sorry for my ramble. :["

"event","We're all prey to society. We are all loosing touch with ourselves. I've seen people change over night. And, it makes me upset. I get this feeling of fake from certain people. Like they are too caught up trying to be something that they are not, but they think they are. I'm not sure what makes these sudden personality changes. I feel like everyone is changing around me. But in a way I'm happy where I stand. I like my taste of music. And I like my sense of clothing. And I like who I am (in a way). And with all of that, I can respect what other people enjoy/believe. Sure I gossip. Who doesn't? I just wish that I could accept these changes. But instead it's making me aggravated. It's frustrating. Very frustrating. I don't like the changes I see. I miss how everything was. But, you can't live in the past. I wish people were real again. I wish they could find themselves and not get caught up in everything. *sigh* Sorry this blog didn't have anything interesting. Or let alone one ranting situation. I just needed to get some stuff off of my mind."

"event","Does your mom ever pull the ""you hate me"" and ""you never spend time with me"" or how about ""it's always about your friends! We're just a money source to you!"" Well my mom pulls that all the time. Stupid me, I tried to set up a shopping day with my mom and only her. Considering it's hard to run across those days with Dad always wanting to go, or Grandma, I thought it would be nice. So last night, I walk out into our living room, ""We should go shopping tomorrow. We haven't been out in a while"". So she agree's and we plan to go shopping tomorrow at around noon-ish. So I wake myself up today, around 11, and I walk around the house hoping to find my mom to find an exact depart time. She's not there. Eh, I figured maybe she ran to the grocery store (a popular day off pass time) or maybe ran up to my Pap's house. So I continue to get ready. 12:30 rolls by. Then 1. Then 2. Then 3. So on and so forth. Finally at 3:30 she comes home. Me, in a fit of disappoint, starts to scream. ""Where were you?!"". Her response ""Oh,.. well. You were still sleeping at 10:30 so I decided to go shopping with April (her friend) instead."" I don't know why but that response made me cry on the spot. Like I set this entire thing up just for her to go with April instead. I was ready, starving, and actually excited to just have a day out. Seeing how upset I was, she decides to tell me about her plans with April for TONIGHT as well. Ok Mom, really, I don't want to hear this. But she continues to tell how she was going to have all of her friends up to watch movies. What I planned on asking, if we could do that when we decided to come home. So that, just made me more upset. As of right now, 4:46 p.m she has decided to just take me to Target after explaining how she hates to shop or spend time with me. The ""great part"" is though, April is still coming along. I don't know if she believes this is a taste of my own medicine. Or if this is some sort of small downfalled plan of Ashley. But she knows I am an emotional wreck to do this to me. I know I have never bailed out on plans with my mom. Probably because we never make any. Sorry my friends love me Mom. So all in all, this has been one of the worst days of my summer.

P.S the worst part is, she just explained to me how she can't stand to take me shopping. For the second time. Really. This is just great.

"event","Grr. The media is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to America. It makes perfectly beautiful people want to mold and shape their bodies into everyone elses. Grr. It makes me so angry. It makes people want to not eat. Not to enjoy this wonderful food our country has to offer because they don't want to gain an ounce that day. But on the other side I'm such a hypocrit. I have so many bad experiences. But I continue to relive them. Because I want to loose weight. I'm pathetic in a way. But it's my life choice right? Should one feel like they should not eat for 3 days, because they had a descent dinner? All because we want to have that perfect body. Honestly I think it's to please the ones we care for most. Like we'll loose them. I think the problem with me is, whenever I feel good [like I'm happy with who I am] something bad will happen. Or reality will kick in. I'm not a tiny girl. What so ever. And I have waaaaaay to much extra weight. Actually no. I'm just plain out fat. So, I don't know. It's my fault though? Isn't it? I just don't know how to fix myself."

"event","As much as I hate to say it, Connellsville isn't as bad as it seems. Sure we have tons of hicks who worship country music and their idol is Billy Rae Sirus. And sure they wear shirts that say things like ""I love mullets"" in red, white, and blue writing. It could be worse though, right? I mean, people rank New York to be this God sent city. I think it would be nice to visit, but in New York, you have to worry about gangs, and do you honestly think you can escape the hicks? They're everywhere. I can't climb inside your mind and take how you feel, but I think Connellsville is alright. We have a nice school. (An awesome marching band :D) We have a community that doesn't really have to worry about extreme violence. Sure we are ranked among the worst for tobacco use. And we sure do have a lot of drunks in the area. And yes, drugs are a problem too. But take a look at reality, isn't that everywhere? Do you honestly think you can walk down a street in New York without seeing a drug deal, or seeing a bottle of Budweiser on the ground? Highly doubt it. And take a look around our city. It has a lot of beautiful scenary. You just have to find it. I feel very cozy in our hometown. Like I was meant to grow up here. I think I am very fortunate to spend my childhood and adolescence around this area. It gives me a sense of the real world, but it also gives me a chance to head to the county fair, or walk down the street to get some chinese with friends. I think we're all lucky. We all have some pretty great memories in this hometown that we can never forget. So in a couple years when we go off to college and some of us go to New York and some go to California, while some stay right here in the Pittsburgh area. We'll always have our memories of these quiet, humble, joyful summers in our minds. We'll never foget each other. No matter what. :]"

"event","Ever have a feeling of trust? Yeah, it's great isn't it? Ever feel like you've been ignored. Left aside for something else? Ever felt them at the same time? I'm really at a loss for words. I feel like a fake. Like I'm tired of wearing this mask to hide who I truely am. When I take it off though, people see right through me. And usually they don't like what they see. So I'm forced to wear this mask to make others happy. What I seem to do best. But in the end result I hurt myself. Others hurt me easily too. I feel ignored most of the time. Because I'm not an attention whore, it is my punishment that I am to be ignored. To be titled the quiet one. I am titled to be stupid or my favorite, to have ""not much to say"". I love how people can ""decifer who I am"". I'm tired of it. The past month has been truely an eye opener. I choose to be who I am. But don't try to change me. The only thing I can tell you is, love me or hate me. Don't leave me dangling on a string as if you want me there for later. For your own use. I feel a great sense of betrayal. I feel restricted to rant too. Fuck.

What a wonderful way to start off my journaling.
Yay."

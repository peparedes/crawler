"event","The Bed

So the other day, or more like sometime last week, it became obvious that the crib which had acted as the bed of my youngest, was broken.  After temporary sleeping arrangements lasting a few days whereby the kids slept on the couches (since they don't like to sleep alone and would have to do just that if one of them stayed in their shared bedroom), it was time to get a new bed.  So off to IKEA the eldest and I went.

I knew the her mother had a preference for a bed similar to that which she had already, but ASCERTAINED prior to going that it would be OK to get another model should we find one more suitable.  So we bought the wrong bed.  And there was hell to pay returning home!  In no uncertain terms I am fully aware that I will have nothing to do with the future ""design"" of the home, whatever that means.  Anyway, the kids are happy :)


Skating

I took the eldest skating again today.  I have yet to notice anyone skating who appears o be having a bad time.  People of all ages and abilities swarming over the ice, barely avoiding catastrophe now and again, but always wearing a smile.  The youngest stayed with her mom, however, on the understanding that she would be going to the store instead.  Which she didn't.  She's a reluctant skater anyway, breaking my back while trying, and then giving up and crawling on her hands and knees beside the rink, grinning and watching everyone else.

I had so much to write today and can't think of a thing."

"event","The Under-Appreciated Sky

So there I was a few nights ago flying the red-eye back to Toronto from Las Vegas.  For the most part the ride was smooth as a baby's ass, a few wispy clouds obscuring the brightly lit cities of the American mid-west below.  But I can never get enough of the stars overhead.

Naturally, if I stare out of the window long enough I'll see a meteor or two, but that majestic spread of light fills me with awe.  It always has, but what's interesting now is that instead of feeling insignificant and vulnerable, I feel as though the stars are familiar, like we're old family, waving at each other.  And I am always aware of the insane luck some protons from various distant - and I mean distant - stars have: generated, say, 4.5 million years ago, they stream of into space, being pulled here and there by various gravitational fields, penetrating gaseous fields, dodging stars and various heavenly bodies, and suddenly after all that time, slam into my retina just after I open my eyelid.  This sets off a chain of nervous impulses in my brain which create the image of a distant star in my mind, tell a story of the distant past of the home of these protons.  What are the chances that proton would meet me so far along down the line after being cast violently from its home?

And life is full of such randomness.  But it doesn't feel random when time is played backwards.  And why not play it backwards since it is a creation of humans anyway?

Las Vegas

And how was Vegas, you ask?  I didn't visit the Strip this time, but got good sleep and finished my Christmas shopping at an outlet mall.  And had some good food at a tapas restaurant.  Maybe next time I'll hit the strip, but I have no idea why - maybe just to feed off the energy for an hour or two.  People watch."

"event","My lips are burning. And my throat.  I should be in Cancun right now, but since I am not, these garlic-szechuan induced pains are symptoms of the sublime silver lining of not being in Cancun - the real reason I am not in Cancun: seared green beans drenched with some garlic sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds and accompanied by the burning szechuan sauce in a little bowl.  Had I made it to Cancun, I would never had these green beans, I am sure.

It was all very much appreciated until the (single) beer affected my already limited chop stick skills, ending up with my looking cross-eyed at a flailing mass of sticks and rigid green beans in front of, and very close to, my nose.  No more was going in my mouth, evidently, so I thrust the plate aside and made way for the nachos.  Then I wondered why I was given chop sticks to eat rigid green beans in the first place...

Though I am these days intent on not paying heed to my ego, I nonetheless afterwards glanced around furtively to see if anyone had been watching me with the beans and sticks - I was, after all, in a Moxies.  In Calgary.  Where it is currently -24 C and dropping, instead of Cancun.

The nachos were great, by the way, though even the half serving was way too much.  Half serving for a rhino maybe.  The pretty server asked if I'd like dessert, which I considered briefly before I realized I'd probably just puke it up later, all just to please that naughty-librarian-looking young lady.  Nope, just the coffee and the laboured stagger up the stairs to my room."

Smedley until recently led a rather unremarkable life (RUL), punctuated occasionally by moments of unfathomable ecstasy (meeting his current wife, practising making children, having those children, flying for a living).  However, storm clouds gathered in recent years as he tried in vain to build a business relating to the manufacture of baby/toddler accessories, something for which he had virtually zero instinct.  Or natural interest.  But I digress.

Little did Smedley know that a remarkably innocuous decision would lead to his ultimate demise - a stunningly gross fly in the ointment of his peaceful RUL. In an attempt to improve cash flow in the short term, he shrugged his shoulders as his exuberant business partner practically careened off the walls in an attempt to explain how retailing a certain commodity would certainly provide operating cash while strategic objectives were met.  This commodity, he was told, had a cult-like following and was at least as addictive as crystal meth. ""Ju-Ju-Be? Sounds kinda baby-ish, but if people will buy them, sure, let's sell them.""  So they bought THOUSANDS of dollars of, ahem, diaper bags and related paraphernalia.

Initial indications were positive - the margin was great and they were very profitable.  Then the economy happened and sales stopped dead in their tracks.  The business suffered and was shuttered, which was, in retrospect, simply the best thing to happen to Smedley and his young family ever.  After months of adjusting to a new stress-free reality where anything to do with the business was practically ignored, Smedley finally could not avert the solemn gaze of the boxes and boxes of Ju-Ju-Be product eyeing him as he walked by day after day. 

But Smedley's RUL changed forever the day he decided to liquidate those boxes of brand new Ju-Ju-Be items. Put simply, he did not know what the hell he was getting himself into.

Having sold a few trinkets on eBay over the years, Smedley thought he'd just load 'em up, sell them for a few bucks more than it cost to ship them and he could clear out those boxes and associated memories of the business.  Why, he had sold a rusty bayonet and engraved pocket watch before, how hard could it be to sell a few bags?

Holy HELL.  Smedley forgot the crystal meth analogy and rather underestimated the passion with which the eager, nay, ""ravenous"" buyers wanted these bags.  It was as if they were on a hunger strike until they received their bags so maybe they could go to the local tattoo parlour with it in hand to get yet another JJB image needled into their buttocks.

So, again in retrospect, Smedley's minimalist eBay listings, completely devoid of shipping options appropriate for people wanted their stuff YESTERDAY, proved inadequate.  Whereas the buyer of a rusty bayonet would not pace back and forth 24/7 waiting for its arrival, the typical JJB buyer's fingers bled on her keyboard as she peppered Smedley with questions relating to anticipated delivery time, whether he had more, whether he had local pick up (they couldn't wait for the red truck evidently), and if he'd combine shipping.  ""Combine shipping?"" Smedley asked himself, ""people will buy more than one of these things?""

Chaos ensued. Somewhere along the line answering 300 emails a day, usually at 3 a.m., took its toll.  Imagine Smedley's disappointment, not to mention heart palpitations, when after packing dozens of items when there a couple ""left over"", and he couldn't locate a couple of others.  ""Crap,"" he deduced, ""I sent a couple of bags to the wrong people.""  And not just ordinary people but JJB addicts (JJBAs). So, after immediately hiring a body guard, he began writing a few painful messages and...well, now is now and he's waiting for at least a couple of these hyper-eager JJBAs to open their (LONG-AWAITED, BTW) package and shriek in horror...

Usually ever the optimist, Smedley now thinks that this can only end badly, his reputation in tatters, death threats published as full-page adverts in national newspapers.  In colour to boot.  What legacy will he leave?  What life for his innocent children?  

Diaper bags - bah!

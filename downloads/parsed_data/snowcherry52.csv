"event","I think I need professional help because I cannot deal with life anymore.

My problem is, I have no insurance and I know I wont be able to get advice on WHERE I can get it in my state ....but in general, are there places that can do it for free/with some affordable cash?

I cant deal with work because I work in a lil' area with tons of caddy bitches that always make me feel stupid. I am not exactly new anymore but I am still learning and well, im a very slow learner. When people talk to me, I feel like I am Charlie Brown and everyone is the teacher. Its all ""waaa waaa blah blah blah"" to me.  Its not that I dont wanna hear it..but I cant process words in my head...and in turn, people get aggravated with me. Also, I have no common sense.  I hate being stupid!

I have no car and I have to use my bfs car in which im grateful for..but I dont wanna abuse that privilage and ask to go to far places like I used to (like travel to other states to see friends, etc). So, I am kinda stuck at home alot and I get cabin fever.......  in turn, i think too much and get depressed.  


My bf (like i wrote in a previose entry) cares way too much about his computer game.  Today, I started crying because my car wouldnt start and he tried to console me....but had to turn around to him computer to make sure his character wasnt dying.  I felt like he really wasnt there for me.  In all other aspects, hes a great bf but I feel like he cares way too much about that fucking (sorry) game....  im sick of having to remind him to do things/get off the computer.


If youw ere to read my journal, you would see I have off and on again eating issues.  I feel as though life would be a lil more better if i lost weight. I am not FAT...but im not happy either with myself.  In turn, I dont really wanna go out to places cuz i dont like my appearance....but i also hate staying in. 


Anyways, I have alot to talk about to someone who would actually listen and give advice.. its just the money that is an issue.


help?"

"event","ever since i found my bf looking at slutty girls on the internet...its helping me more towards my weight loss goal.  i dont feel comfortable at all with myself and its making a bad impact on our relationship. I feel as though i hafta look like these girls even though he said i am fine.  however, i dont feel fine and i need to lose tons of weight.  im finaly under my 150 hurdle. now i just hafta keep on going. I need to stop throwing up though and doing dumb things like that because i know its not healthy for me.  i find myself throwing up though without having to try...when i get nervous and stuff :/  anyways, i need to stop smoking..but first, im gonna try to eat healthier and go to the gym..  one step at a time.  


today i had a dexatrim drink and coco pebbles with soy milk.  the coco pepples arnt exactly healthy but at least i tried with the soy milk and i had the dex before hand.
for lunch, i had chicken with cheese and hot sauce. not healhty either (chicken was breaded) but i had water instead of soda.
dinner....KFC =[  it wasnt too bad though. it was obviosly fried chicken but i got a 3 piece nugget thing and fries.  

iv been editing this as i eat something.  i guess its good to write what you eat cuz now i see where i have problems.  i dont have money to buy healthy things right now..  i am eating what my bf got for grocieries.  i randomly went through peoples LJs and found someone on a baby food diet. at first i was like wtf? but it doesnt seem do bad.......  it doesnt have many bad things in it...mostly all natural....HMM!!!
i need to work out today...i got the turbo jam workout...looks like fun."

I then looked at his history on his computer and saw that he was looking at porn. maybe i could forgive that but not something else. The fact that he was 'searching' for girls on myspace and looking at thier slutty pictures really got to me.  I wanted to break up with him but I dunno what to do.  It felt like he was indirectly cheating on me.  Its like...he cant tell me WHY he was doing it. He told me he was a guy and being a scumbag. A scumbag is right. I wish I knew WHY he was doing it though.  Am I no longer attractive to him?  Well I guess I have to really lose weight now so that if we do break up...I can look great for someone else.  He told me I look good to him now but obviosly not if hes looking at thin sluts =*(  

I lost my appitite when I saw that and therefore I didnt eat dinner.  As of now, I lost 8 pounds =D  I still need to go to the gym though. My goal is to weigh 120. I am at 147 now.  I wanted to be thin for when we went to miami next year but if im not with him..at least ill still be thinner =]

Id rather be drinking water with some kinda stuff in it... in hopes that it suppresses my appetite rather than throwing stuff up.

well, one thing about him living far....i didnt have to worry about my body 'that much'. i still cared but we saw each other here and there and when i knew he was coming down.......i would try to lose a few pounds before he came. heh.  well, this time........now that im single.....im gonna try my HARDEST to lose 40 pounds. who knows, maybe i can get him back later down the road and i can be awesome and more comfortable being around him.......or i'll be with somebody else and have it be the same (more comfortable). i find that when im feeling chubby...i shut down.  like, i cant be myself cuz im worried about being fat.

"event","im not sure if i even have a bf right now. hes thinking if he wants to be with me cuz of how i acted.  last night really sucked and now i have to do a double at work and deal with peoples bullshit.  the good thing is: i lost the couple pounds i gained from when i ate a lil too much the night before.......

the bad thing is, i bought cigarettes cuz i figured it would help me calm down (although i know it raises blood bressure)......it also helps me keep my mind off food. iv smoked before and never became 'an addict'.  i smoke here and there and if im done with the pack........i dont smoke for another few months.  
i know it doesnt help alot.....but i try to take my anti oxidents in hopes the bad stuff will not stick to me haha. =X

anyways, i need to start working out but im so stressed over me and the bf that i dont feel like going out......when i know i should really do it cuz it will help me calm down.


yesterday i ate:
a yogurt
a few bites of some chicken soup
a steak and spinach burrito
hot chocolate
iced coffee

i stoped eating at 6 pm."

"event","i watched True Life on mtv about people who wanted to lose weight and one was of a girl who was in a pagaent and when it came time for it, she would go on a 2 week cottage cheese diet.  it sounded weird but she did it.....and looked awesome in the end.  of course her docs and others were telling her that it was bad and that she should do it healthier........but she didnt do it that way.

that was obviosly supposed to tell the viewers NoT to diet that way......but in my head......i was like 'ok, im buying cottage cheese and im gonna eat only that until im down to 148'.  im getting ridiculous.  iv been this weight FOREVER.  i NEED to lose weight.  so, stupid me is gonna do this in hopes i get over the hump.  im gonna do the cottage cheese thing till im down to 148.  when i get down to that, i may go on a different 'diet' and try to get down to 138.......etc.

after that whole deal, i saw this mag.

*the mag above was supposed to be of linsey lohan very skinny.......i guess it changes as the cover changes. oops*

and although i think they look kinda gross.......im still striving to get tiny. whatever! im so fucking sick of my weight on my mind every second."

"event","everyday im like ""should i just eat healthy and let it come off slowly.."" or eat hardley anything and let it come off somewhat fast and possibly gain it back fast when i do go to eat alot again""?  id like to do the last one........and maybe i should think positive in that i WONT binge.

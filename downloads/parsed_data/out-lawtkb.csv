"event","Blizzard has always been an inspiration for me when it comes to my art.  Mezten and Samwise have both influenced my art more than any one else in character design.  I was first blessed by their art when my friend and I played Warcraft.  Hell before that.  Their art was all over the installation and instruction manual.  Mezten's dirty pencil drawings always make the game seem eviler than the cartoon like characters and humorous dialog appear on screen, while Samwise makes the heroes and creatures bulked up and giving them extreme exaggerations making it almost <i>comic-like.</i>  

Of course these are the only guys that have affected the way I draw.  I'll eventually cover most of them though so people can understand where the hell my shit originates from.  Anyways, this is rather rough at the moment; hoping to continue work on it until its done.

"event","Now I know I said I wasn't going to rant in this thing but something has been irritating me lately.  My mother seems to be possessed by <i>God</i>.  My brother has been wanting to move in with my father and I for awhile now and although we wouldn't have it any other way my mother will be fighting us the whole way.  Tonight my mother told me that my brother committed a sin (i.e. the title.)  Yes, I am paraphrasing.  Last time I checked that wasn't a sin.  My brother seriously wants to move in with us.  Why would my mother force him to stay with her beyond his will?  I mean, they are living with her parents now.  He has no real life because of this.  He told me that he sits on the couch and watches whatever everyone else is watching.  He of course has been coming over to hang out with me a lot these last past weeks.  More so than I have time for now but I'm loving it.  I know what hes going through more than anyone else.  I'd like to make this less physical and emotionally eroding than what I experienced.  Which brings me back to my point.

Now, don't get me wrong, I love my mother.  I do happen to know that she can manipulate the <i>fuck</i> out of you though.  To say that my brother is going against ""God's"" will pisses me off so much.  I mean it has actually gotten to the point where I'm typing this shit out like a little emo kid now.  Fuck, I don't even believe in a god.  How the hell can she tell me that hes wrong for wanting to leave.  From what I understand my mothers been sucking off of people financially for a good 7 years now.  She's totally ruined my fathers credit now and has let the house, wonderful when we left it, turn to total shit.  Its so bad that she can't stand living in it.  Even the neighbors tell us they wish <i>we</i> kept the house.    If you've noticed that this entry doesn't exactly flow nicely, you must excuse me; I'm a little tense.  So to wrap up this completely spontaneous post: Fuck religion, fuck the ""commandments,"" and fuck ""God.""  <i>Whens the last time you talked to an atheist?</i>

"event","Thats it, I have given in and followed the mind boggling fab of the information wave:  the livejournal.

What the <i>fuck</i> do I need a livejournal for.  Nothing really exciting happens in my life although you'd never know by my humble appearance.  No this livejournal is not for the overflowing emotions that our generation can't handle, but is more or less for my expressions.  I'm talking art my friends.  The one thing that has lasted throughout our species time line that not only manifests our ideals and thoughts but also has no rational place in this world.  To think one would go to a degree giving institution to <i>learn</i> how to stroke a pencil around on a blank medium hoping to make a buck or two....

Wow...already started ranting. Well I guess I'll leave you with the first pic on the fresh LJ.

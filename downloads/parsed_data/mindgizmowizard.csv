"event","I got this from <lj user=""arf""> . If you leave me a comment, I'll ask you 5 things about either your interests or what I know about you (sometime within 24 hours of you commenting). You can either answer the questions here or turn around and answer them in your lj with these instructions.<br /><br />These questions were from <lj user=""arf""> :<br /><br /><strong>1. Which of the Phoenix Wright games is your favorite?</strong><br />I'd have to hesitate between the third Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice. While Apollo Justice has much better gameplay and mechanics, the third Phoenix Wright has way better characters and cases. And it has Godot.<br /><br /><strong>2. What have you been up to the last couple of years?</strong><br />Studying Math, then finding out Math was boring, and then going into studying Accounting. Otherwise, I don't really know where to start.<br /><br /><strong>3. Do you play any musical instruments?</strong><br />Yes, I know how toplay the piano and the saxophone, although I'm extremely out of practice for both. I have a small guitar and tried learning it, but I suck and don't have enough spare time and/or perseverance for that precise endeavour.<br /><br /><strong>4. How'd you come up with the name &quot;mindgizmowizard&quot;?</strong><br />My previous screenname had been &quot;MindStealer&quot;, taken from the old Magic: the Gathering videogame. I wanted to keep some of it, so I kept &quot;Mind&quot;. Now the &quot;Gizmo Wizard&quot; part came from a Roleplaying forum I used to be a part of; my characters, however different from one another, were all part of a long bloodline of gifted mechanics and scientists. They were all &quot;Gizmo Wizards&quot; of some sort... (at least, that's what my poor grasp of English translated it as), so... voil&agrave;!<br /><br /><strong>5. Cake or pie?<br /></strong>Pie, definitely. Although delicious cake is Portal-friendly, I have to say apple pie or strawberry-rhubarb pie are some my utmost favorite pastries.<strong><br type=""_moz"" /></strong><br />"

And it is THOSE elements which are important when considering whether or not you truly like someone.

In short, it is unfair to ask someone to change because you do not like what they are; either live with it, or live without them."

"event","It's quite a discovery, but I've noticed the bitchier what you're saying is, the closer it is to what you think is true. A corollary is that people feel more insulted if they think what you're saying is true. Therefore, bitching is a form of search for truth, and is therefore philosophy.

It's a very strong statement."

"event","In 1976 the British astronomer Patrick Moore announced on BBC Radio 2 that at 9:47 AM a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event was going to occur that listeners could experience in their very own homes. The planet Pluto would pass behind Jupiter, temporarily causing a gravitational alignment that would counteract and lessen the Earth's own gravity. Moore told his listeners that if they jumped in the air at the exact moment that this planetary alignment occurred, they would experience a strange floating sensation. When 9:47 AM arrived, BBC2 began to receive hundreds of phone calls from listeners claiming to have felt the sensation. One woman even reported that she and her eleven friends had risen from their chairs and floated around the room.

Amazing what a little placebo will do.
Or just people looking for attention in general.
Funny and pathetic, really."

1953 - Aperture Science begins operations as a manufacturer of shower curtains. Early product line provides a very low-tech portal between the inside and outside of your shower. Very little science is actually involved. The name is chosen to make the curtains appear more hygienic.

1956 - Eisenhower administration awards Aperture a contract to provide shower curtains to all branches of the military except the Navy.

1957-1975 - Mostly shower curtains.

1978 - Aperture Founder and CEO, Cave Johnson, is exposed to mercury while secretly developing a dangerous mercury-injected rubber sheeting from which he plans to manufacture seven deadly shower curtains to be given as gifts to each member of the House Naval Appropriations committee.

1979 - Both of Cave Johnson's kidneys fail. Brain damaged, dying, and incapable of being convinced that time is not now flowing backwards, Johnson lays out a three tiered R&D program. The results, he says, will ""guarantee the continued success of Aperture Science far into the fast-approaching distant past.""

Tier 1: The Heimlich Counter-Maneuver - A reliable technique for interrupting the life-saving Heimlich Maneuver.

Tier 2: The Take-A-Wish Foundation - A charitable organization that will purchase wishes from the parents of terminally ill children and redistribute them to wish-deprived but otherwise healthy adults.

Tier 3: ""Some kind of rip in the fabric of space... That would... Well, it'd be like, I don't know, something that would help with the shower curtains I guess. I haven't worked this idea out as much as the wish-taking one.""

I'd love:
-A new Video card. Like... this one. (love)
http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=FR&sku_id=0665000FS10088627&catid=#
-A new Monitor also... Actually, it's even more important than the new video card, but it's also more utilitary.
-The new Trauma Center on the Wii (New Blood, was it called?)
-Super Smash Bros.: Brawl on the Wii
-Fire Emblem on the Wii
-Even Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles would be great!
-Anima: Beyond Fantasy (the Role-Playing Game) (Actually a large WANT, but probably not out till the summer)
-Well, let's also wish for SPORE then! (PC Game)
-BoardGames, from ""OH YEAH"" to ""I'd like it"":
Civilization
Diplomacy
Descent
Doom
-Exalted stuff... All I have is the Exalted Corebook and the Comic series... I *desire* ALL OF THEM except for the Storyteller's Companion (because it is unedited crap)...
-Maybe some training stuff? (Like weights? Or elastic stretcher stuff?)
-Sherlock Holmes books.
-Or Agatha Christie.

There... I guess that's it. But anything's fine-- including nothing! =3"

"event","All right. Enough already. I'm hearing all over the news that sensationnalism about the American government actually faking the 9/11 terrorist attacks in order to basically legal-rape the Constitution. It's all great and all that a lot of random conspiracy hypothesists are making hours-long videos with a lot of conjecture and very little evidence in them, but let's not get over ourselves, shall we? Let's just look at both sides of the coin before we call it a cheat.
 
<a href=""http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm"">NIST's Investigation</a>
This is an investigation by the American National Institute of Standards and Technology. Conspiracy nuts will claim that they are a governmental institution, so they should be in cahoots, shouldn't they? Well, whether they are in cahoots or not, it doesn't matter; if the facts and arguments are straight (and every fact is rigorously referenced), it shouldn't matter. Unless you let your zealotry blind your rationality.

<a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1227842.html"">Popular Mechanics</a>
Well, this actually isn't from the government! Would you look at that! It's actually from Popular Mechanics. Its neutral stance should even the odds, if you read through the whole thing. I know it's not as flashy as a sensationnalist video devoid of any susbstance and repeating the same damn strawman argument over and over but... it's a start. And I'm talking about both sides of the 9/11 argument, here.

<a href=""http://www.loosechangeguide.com/LooseChangeGuide.html"">Loose Change 2nd Edition Viewer's Guide</a>
Basically, a debunk for the Loose Change video. You're better off watching Loose Change 2nd Edition before even reading this.

I'm not saying I full-heartedly agree to everything in these links. I'm not even saying I disagree with what the conspiracy nuts are saying. I'm just saying that too many people watch the alarmist side and give no credit to the conservative side.

PS: Lucas, this is not a veiled way of saying you're wrong, just in case that's what you were thinking. I think it would do you good to read these; but your post simply reminded me I wanted to post this a while ago but never did."

As of now I've got a total of 2 potential players. Anyone interested? I'm planning on either a game of Slayers, Fushigi Yuugi or Escaflowne. I'm afraid I lost a player due to lack of confidence in my organizational skill.

I got fined some 250$ for going at 90 km/h in a 50 km/h zone... Thing is, the zones were so badly displayed, You had Max 90 somewhere, 50 meters later you get a Max 70 and then 50 others later, a max 50... either way, I'm pretty certain I wasn't going 90 since there were streetlights just afterwards, so I'll be contesting away.

"event","I woke up yesterday morning after a deceivingly short Exalted game (damn 1h AM limit) and I was coldly greeted, then I proceeded to help Josi finish her Philo thing. Quite a nice day, as as soon as I could bring her to her oral exam, we went ahead and then I waited, then we went back here all with Josi being not-so-slightly pouty. Then, we all went home to finish sewing and making cosplays... All in all a stressful and disagreeable day. At least the cosplays are done...

Then I wake up this morning, at like 6h30, supposed to give a lift, and my father in all his generosity (and since it coincides with his work schedule) offers to do it in my place, so that I can sleep a bit (we went to bed at like 3...) but then Josi complains that she wants to see me (for the 20 minutes drive, while I'll have at least 40 minutes of getting back since the other way is blocked at that time)... only later was there an attitude change...

Then again, I still haven't solved that problem from last friday... But that's wholly another story.

In 2 hours, we leave for Toronto. Wish me good luck (and good staying awake)!"

"event","I currently feel immensely frustrated and have no idea why. I'm at the edge of yelling at the first person who talks to me with only slight disrespect (which would be immensely irrational and stupid) and so I reflect on why I feel like so.

Started out immediately after eating an unholy amount of chocolate fondue and fruits. I felt unwell and unreceptive to anything, and so I thought it was merely the fact I hadn't had supper before eating all that sugar and chocolate. So I went like ""Well, sucks to be me, I ate a lot of sugar, got on a sugar high, now I'm on a sugar low, no biggie, it'll get better in a few minutes, or an hour or so...""

And so I resolved that it was useless to show my bad mood and instead joyfully talk and joke around despite everyone else being tired and slightly sick. I quickly got put back to place (an extremely disagreeable experience) and so resolved that it was useless to put on such a front, especially in such circumstances. What happens when I'm not in a good mood is that I don't like being hogged (do not read the verb ""to hug"" but rather, ""to hog"") nor being disturbed much. Which both happened. I figured, well, it's an extended sugar low, I'll forget about it tomorrow. So we get home with me not talking and walking quickly, they talk sewing and stuff while I leap onto the comp before immediately going to bed.

Waking up, I find myself still frustrated. Figuring it was my usual morning numbness, I proceed to eat, shower, dress, go to school... I get called and I'm gonna work and Sei'll come in a bit later (which does not make much sense in my book but it's really none of my business), so I don't know why exactly I have to go but I do. And it's the Exalted game tonight. And I bet we won't exactly finish at 5 PM, either. I'm willing to help as a temporary measure but it should be considered that I'm unavailable on Thursdays... I don't even know how I'll feel about the Exalted game tonight. I looked forward to it a lot but I now ask myself what I have to look forward to...

I really shouldn't have posted while I had dark thoughts, huh?
Anyway, that's that."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT color=#33cc00 size=4>Its was something that hit me when you looked at me with those brown eyes that lite up with the radiant color of your soft skin... Never had i seen eyes like those...once we spoke it engraved a smile on my face that i won't soon forget... the laughter that came out of you and the tenderness of your voice is somthing most don't have... it wasn't the till the first time that we touched did i realize how magical this really was... From your soft hands that can mesmorize me to the gentalness of our few kisses that made me weak in the knees and waiting on petals for the next one to come... But now its all gone and it feels like a dream that was to good to be true, not knowing if this had happened at all... i lay there and wonder...believe in magic or hope in this feeling that was so real.. Know when we look at eachother its no longer there, the giggle of love, the addrline of a crush and the warmth of care, its almost like it was never there are the only thing that makes me hold on to those magical moments of time are those eyes that caught me to begin with</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000066>.... i dedicate this to the one that made my eyes one to a more beautiful place with out even knowing it.... He is an ""AWESOME GUY!"" xoxo melissa</FONT></P>"

My sister came back and right now they are out side talking to the cops she said that she is moving out... i dont undersatnd it...her and her boyfriend or whatever he is have only been going out for a month... i mean is this all worth it... getting kick out of the FAMILY cause my step da told her if she leaves he'll dissown her... she has to fend for her self....i don't understand what is running through her head... i mean and mike is rich or anything... he has no car, no job, doesn't go to skool i mean what the hell is he gonna do for her?....... i donno...... whatever and the sad part is that i&nbsp; don't feel sorry for her beacuse she was asking for it all along.... i can't feel sorry for her..... NEWAYS... last night was.... CONFUSING.....I went to Jacksons with get this.... AL, Alex, Me, Dan and YALE.... ask me where he fit in that picture but we were gonna play football and stuff she we invited him.... lol... football...anyways by the time we were done at jacksons it was getting pretty dark and so we played football for about 5 min... lol... so then Dan gets this engenius plan to go in to the beach in the dark by himself.... so he goes to go in and went to through al and and she said no... so i donno how i got into it but he said if i through sand at him i'd pay... so he dared me and hey I don't back down off MUST dares.... so i did... and he chased me through half of the beach... finally in my NEW shirt he through he in... and at first it was just good clean fun wrestleing and all off a sudden it got some what.... i don't want to say it....lets just say werid... and i felt like i was fighting for my life.... lets just say that i lost my pants for about 5 minutes and the ocean gobbled my undergarmits.... lol.... it was horrible and for ANYONE who knows me well i hate nudity and i was freaking out.... THANK GOD it was dark....nothing happend.... but i felt like feeling were flying all over and i had mixed feelings... but i got upset cause in the end i knew that to him it was just fun and games and to me it was just alittle more... to make this already long story short we didn't say to words to eachother after that and i know it was nothing to him... so like i told you last night i want to much to just be ""friends"" but then that ""feeling:"" gets in the way and anything he does makes it not just friends anymore and i know EVERY girl know how that goes...... so at this point i am just letting it be.... i think......</P>

RIGHT AL?.... ok....bye"

I NEED TO DO&nbsp; ME for a little while... i sick of trying to find what everyone else has... or at least has had before... the 4 letter word that i don't believe in so much in anymore... i figured think i will just say that that i'm gonna die alone so that if something does happen or someone does some along i will be totally surpised... he is with her... i saw them at the mall together yesterday... i was little upset but i just took a deep breath and WENT SHOPING!.... Prom alone HERE I COME! i will see him probably see him at church... and the thing is that he wants to be friends like we were before so he has been really nice to me or at least tried to be but its hard for me and i am trying to be real nice about it but if i do see him today i tink that i will just walk away.... he doesn't have our luch anymore which is kinda good so i don't see him at all day excpect afterschool and even after school its easy for me not to see him... i think right now i am just trying to be nice and i am pretending to be his friend cuz deep in side... I HATE HIM... ok hate is&nbsp;a big words... more like don't trust, don't like, dissapointed.... on another subject... i finally got my shoes for prom so everything is complete... i talk to my dad and he is doing ok... i miss him alot... i've been waiting to go to church ALL WEEK i am feening for it so maybe i will leave on a happier note and maybe just maybe HAVE a GREAT week.... i really really hope and pray!&nbsp; i guess that all.... SAVE THE DRAMA FOR UR MAMA!</FONT></EM></P>"

"event","Ok here is what i have to say.. i think i am going to forget about the whole dan thing and just forget about dan in general its causeing much more drama then i thouht and to my dear friend allison i think that i am putting her in an uncomfortable position so there for i am choosing to just let it ride and let it pan out the way that its supposed to... if we were ment to go to prom together then we will then if not... well so be it i will go by myself and you know what i think that i am ok with that... i reall think that i want him to go to prom with me but at this point things are really werid and i think that allison is going to tell me today that he really does like alexa... hey its all good... let i go mel, just let it go...you have 6 weeks left in this shit whole so just say WTF and move on... i wrote him a note and i wondered if he read it he said he did and that he was going to try to write me back so we'll see... i don't think that i am going to be in a good mood in a few if he gives me the note but hey i asked for it so i can't chicken out... i must say that i think i will be dieing alone... which is kinda sad to say but as i was tell my friend... its better to think that you will alwasys be alone than to pretend that your prince charming will one day come when in fact you know he might never come around... and if he does well at least i will surprised cause i was looking or waiting for it... i think that is the best idea that i have come up with in a really long time... c/s~> man my hands are really cold it kinda hurts to type.. this thing has seriously become my new bwstfriend...everyone is excited that the weekend is almost here but i am not because i donno what that hell i am going to do... i think that if i am home long enough i will become alittle depressed... so i hope that maybe allison will want to do something... the last thing that i want to do is talk to brittany and her talk me into going to beezy and ryan's house... cause i am sooooooooooo over with that... I love brittany and i she is a really good friend but i really don't like hanging out with the boys anymore...c/s~> so i saw ashleys's mom today... she was really upset when i talked to her... i mean i just don't understand why she would drop out when she was soooo close... why would you go to school for 13 years and then drop out on your last year...that was a waste of time! i feel bad for her... I LOVE YOU SANDY!... well i guess thats all for now... if anything eles happens i will come to you for an update... love

Yay... for me right al?... i did a good thing not only was i doing good but i said i am sorry for being such a bitch yesterday and i wrote him a note telling him exactly  how i was feeling... hopefully that will clear things up... it will either make or break things.... aaawww its my song... i am not even going to go there...AL... did you like my shirt today?... i knew you would... i was so excited to wear it.... I wonder if MY AWSOME friend would think that it was funny too... welll i guess there is something eles i want i want to do but i just don't think that i can... Al there is one thing that would really kill me if i saw it... was if i saw him wearing my flash shirt!!! i think my heart would break into a million pieces! well i don't want to keep looking at the negative side of everythig... so here is something that i wish i could say... to you i write this and to you's i like to say, you've taken my heart and thrown it away... i trusted you and thought that you were true but in the end your just like them... although you hurt me and i may have cried i wish there was something to prove that we tried... the night that was supposed to for you and me has turn dark and i wish that i could make you see... i want you to know that you are special to me and i have to pray and hope that soon you will be... it might be to late because you found someone knew... but till prom night i will be waiting for you...

"event","Ok i really wasn't done... i am really upset right now.... i mean i would cry just to let this feeling out of my tummy but i don't think he is wroth it right now and he really isn't that serious... but its the fact that it happens to me EVERYTIME... i mean does it say PLAY with me somewhere on my head....cuz thats all that guys seem to be doing to with me the last couple of times.... i mean maybe it was stupid of me to think anything so fast but after the last couple of times we hung out i seriously thought that he got the hint that YES I DO LIKE YOU.... but i guess it hasn't hit him... and the whole thing about the beach and tonight i mean i wouldn't have been so offened or upset if he would of told me about her to begin with or tell me stright up what he was doing instead of twisting the stories and lieing to me.... i mean i thought we had talked about honesty and the fact that everything gets more complecated when lies get in the way... I AM SOOOOOO CONFUSED, i really don't even know that if at this point i should even say anything... i mean is it even wroth saying anything.... I DON'T KNOW"

"event","i'd like to tell you all a story.  it starts the way most good stories start...

there once was a girl.  

the girl fell in love.  the girl didn't just fall in love.  she FELL. IN. LOVE.  with a friend.  sadly, this friend was already in love.  this friend wasn't just in love.  she was IN. LOVE.  with someone who would never love her back.  the friend tried.  but no matter how amazing the girl was or what she did, the friend could not love the girl.  not just love her.  LOVE. HER.  but the girl clung to her love, valiently.  it was her sword and her shield.  but swords are heavy.  shields are heavier.  and love is heaviest of all.  it took all of her energy, all of her being to weild her love.  which she weilded at the cost of all else.  the girl became consumed by her love. it was all that existed.  the friend was all she saw.  her love for the friend was all she felt.  nothing else mattered.  and in time, just as it always must, the weight began to take its toll.  the girl was no longer herself.  she no longer weilded her weapons.  they weilded her.  she became merely an extension of the function of her sword, the purpose of her shield.  she became a slave to her own love of her friend.  the friend, exhausted from dodging the sword, evading the shield, began to fight back.  it was not a clean fight.  it was not fair.  blood was drawn.  scars were etched into flesh.  there were civilian casualties.  but despite the losses, despite the trauma, despite the chaos and the bloodshed, the girl refused to surrender.  in another story, this might be valient.  a commendible refusal to desert one's dream, one's purpose.  but this is not that story.  so the battle continued.  endless and bloody.  until the girl and her friend destroyed each other completely.  their bodies lay in pieces.  their hearts beat no more.  the sun did not rise.  the wind  did not blow.  the earth was silent.  even the love was gone. 

this is your humble narrator, saying good-night and keep your hearts to yourselves."

Instructions: List 5 albums you are into right now. No matter what the genre, whether they have words, or even if they're not any good, but they must be albums you're really enjoying now. Post these instructions in LJ along with your album picks.

1. regina spektor -- soviet kitsch/songs:  okay, so technically this is two albums but they're both burned onto the same cd, so i'm counting them as one.  she's what i would imagine would happen if you took tori, fiona apple and bjork, smooshed them together and served them between two pieces of bunny bread with some milk and apple slices. these two are responsible for 'prisoners' 'consequence of sound' 'us' and 'ghost of corporate future' -- all of which, once they get tangled in my brain, practically have to be pried out with a spork.

2. neko case -- blacklisted:  this is one of her ""darker"" albums.  sometimes i like to imagine that she's tom waits' daughter.  mostly because when she drops the timbre of her voice, she makes me shiver like only tom waits makes me shiver.

3. tom waits -- blood money:  ""i'd sell your heart to the junkman baby for a buck, FOR A BUCK""  *full-body shiver*  i heard this album referred to as ""sexy insomniac circus music"", and really that's the only way to describe it.  it must be my carnie blood.

4. nkaspiration -- recoul at the masquerade:  i've been feeling kind of bad lately (and when i say bad, i don't mean depressed).  these three songs are that mood rolled in a tiny ball and tucked in the corner of my black corset like a weapon.

5. ani difranco -- not a pretty girl:  this is one of the five or six early-mid 90s ""femme rock"" albums i periodically come back to.  i used to listen to this one in 9th grade when i spent a weekend gluing things to my ceiling and painting my old rollerskates, so it always puts me in a creative mood. i've been listening to this one while i knit/sew/collage/cartoon.

"event","being drunk is lame.  i seriously just ate like half a jar of strawberry preserves without even thinking about it.

""going out"" is so strange.  it's like this big, warped freak show where all the girls are walking around in their jeans with heels trying to be sexy to attract the guys who are bouncing around like idiots trying to be funny to impress the girls and everyone is constantly rushing to the bathroom to check their makeup or throw up and trying to talk to each other above the roar of the music except no one is really listening to anyone else cause they're all to busy looking around to see what everyone else is doing.

and then there's the group of us at a table in the back by the dj drinking and people-watching and bouncing around like idiots, dancing to david bowie and laughing our asses off.  i feel like a total asshat just for saying this, but in a way it's kind of freeing to go out KNOWING that you're not going to attract anybody anyway, so you don't have to bother worrying about how stupid you look when you're dancing and singing ""burning down the house"" at the top of your lungs.  the last time i lived in baton rouge (oh so many years ago) i HATED going out cause i spent the entire time being self-conscious about how i looked and by the end of the night i left totally depressed because absolutely every girl there looked better than me and i was totally invisible to guys and blah blah blah fishcakes.  sometimes doing things is so much more enjoyable when you just don't give a shit. 

also, we got to see mr. fabulous (80's night's resident be-costumed, perpetually glittered, flamboyantly flaming queen) wearing a half black/half white mohawk made out of what seemed to be paper-mache' (with stars painted on).  that guy makes me so happy, i can't even tell you.

the bad part about drinking is that by the end of the night my tongue always itches. and there's never anyone around to lick.

truer words were never spoken.  just when i think i have a handle on things, just when i think i've begun to grasp the complexities, see their design, i learn more and i realize that everything i thought i knew was a noonday shadow of the truth.  

save for a handful of moments, i feel like i'm always a step away from actually living.  whine whine whine whine whine whine whine.  i am the biggest fucking whiner i've ever met.  i recognize this.  but i don't know how to stop it.  i don't want to stop THINKING but it's almost as if i can't live if i'm THINKING about it.  how the hell do i fix that?

the gang was all back together tonight and it was like old times.  i think i laughed myself another 10 years of life.  i journeyed to the brink of a strange 5-year-old-with-her-toys insanity, brought back by aimee's impromptu kitten bath.  tonight is going in the purple bag.

i need to stop fucking eating.  i've felt like a bottomless pit for the past few days...stuffed pretzels and cheesecake at work and all the munchies i bought the other night and fucking pizza and goddamn that popeyes tonight was so fucking good i just wanted to rub that biscuit all over my face.  it's not even like i'm about to start my period.  now i feel all BLEGH.  and i look like fucking boudin in my jeans.  

on the upside...i FIIIINALLY got my 'V' tattoo and it is A-to-the-wesome.  the guy that inked me was really nice and touched up my other wrist for free.  and he gave me a piece of his sour apple bubble gum.  i might have to have a few of his babies.

"event","i'm having an incredibly strong urge to start gluing things to the wall next to my bed.  random things.  old check stubs, pictures, pieces of glass.  i dont have any glue.  i dont have a car.  i hate that people wont go away when i want them to and stay away when i want them here.  i've never been on the same mood cycle as everyone else.  i want to go out when everyone else wants to stay in and i want to stay in when i'm being bugged from all directions to go out.  time seems very unwilling to accomodate me lately.  

last night i bought a <a href=""http://www.kandhcorp.com/images/IMG_green_1a.jpg"">violin</a>.  when it comes in i'm going to lock myself in my room for days.  this music is making it worse.  in a good way.

lately i've been thinking a lot about opening a shop.  it started as just idle musings about opening our own coffee shop coupled with my wanting to start selling scarves and crafts at the arts market.  but then, the more we mused the more excited i really got about it.  there was talk of new orleans and rebuilding and the resurgence of and art culture.  then, on one of our random trips over there, we saw some buildings for rent in perfect locations (frenchman st, magazine) and i immediately started painting and decorating and filling them with merchandise in my head and i was so excited i couldnt get my ideas down fast enough.  i dont even know how to describe what kind of a shop i'm envisioning except to call it a bohemian paradise.  we would serve coffee and teas and there would be big sprawling cushy victorian chairs and couches and once a week there would be random live entertainment (djs, poetry readings, burlesque shows, live bands, tea ceremony), but there would also be a small music/movie section that would cater to rare and hard to find movies and bands.  we would also sell knitwear, clothes, corsets, pipes, ceramics and art--all handmade by either ourselves or people we know or artists that deserve to have their things sold and cant get them sold anywhere else.  hampering my excitement is the downside.  this is such a fucking ambitious enterprise.  it would require no less then my own blood and a serious commitment of at least the next few years of my life.  and i still really want to get the hell out of here and go make films.  though, it was pointed out to me that we could continue to make films and have film screenings at the shop.  i don't know.  i just feel like i might have to choose between two things i really want to do and i told myself i wasnt going to have to choose unless i absolutely want to and i'm not sure if i absolutely do.

i just realized that the sun has gone down and i havent left my bed.  *bad, tiffany*  time to get ready for the hookah cafe tonight.  *sigh* i hope he comes.  even if he does bring her.  he probably wont.  i dont want to care.  so i'm not going to.  just like that.  ha.  fucking estrogen."

"event","Going to USF this weekend to stay with joey!!! I'm so excited! I'll be back on Sunday for my game though. Homecoming is coming up soon to! I got my dress...it's really pretty! I'm so excited about that! But other than that...nothing else really interesting going on in my life. Work still sucks. I get stuck with the closing shift everyday I work. And I get stuck on door all night! We hired two new girls to and one of them was taught how to run the board the other night.....and I haven't been taught that yet and I've been there longer than she has! I was pissed! I kept getting yelled at by Ted....he's an a-hole! And everybody kept giving me wrong table numbers and the tables were still freakin dirty because of bussers are sooooo slow! i looked liked an idiot sitting people! Oh!! The other night at work....one of the mexican bussers asked me if i was dyke! I wanted to kick him in the balls! How rude is that!?! Well anyways I got to go and get ready to leave for tampa..peace out cub scouts!"

"event","Life just sucks for me. I hung out with joey today. We went to see a movie. We cuddled and everything. It was great. He said that it was a date and everything. But it just hurts so much knowing that we are not together. He said we'll go back out...just not right now. I kissed him to and it was amazing. I just don't understand why we can't be together and work out our problems. Life is just so unfair."

"event","Well its been about 3 days since joey and i broke up....and honestly i'm doing good! I think that this was a good idea. Even though it hurts like hell...it was probably the best thing to do. Who knows if we'll go back out or not...but whatever. I'm single now!!! I can date anybody!! What about that hurricane?!? Another one already! I really hope that it moves away from us! We don't need another hurricane right now. But oh well...school was good today..i had a anatomy test, which i think i did pretty good on! Then i went out to lunch with shelby. We went to applebees and i had the oriental chicken salad...for anyone who likes salad..next time your at applebees....get that salad!! It's soo good! But i got to go beautify myself for work! peace out.

I'm the youngest one working there. We're busy all the time...but i get some pretty hot guys in there to eat. But anyways, steph and I went out to lunch today then to pick up my tip shares from work...made $127 in three nights! I was excited..then i got home and my mom wanted $100 of it to pay off the clothes i got for work from Express. I never knew being a hostess could be so tiring. Oh well though. We didn't have school for a week because of the hurricane. Kinda sucks because it cuts into our christmas break. But at least lunch is free for 3 weeks and we dont have a dress code! I had a soccer game over the weekend and we won 3-1. This fat girl kicked me from behind and left a cleat mark on the back of leg...it hurts like hell. my girlfriend and i went to see Princess Diaries 2 last night....wasn't as good as the first one...just to let anybody know whose thinking about seeing it. And it's long to!
Well my boyfriend left for college last week. Yeah i was sad and everything. I cried. But i'm acutally taking it alot better than i thought i would. But anyways i'm going to go...nothing really exciting to write..ttyl!"

Well i got into a little tiffy with my boyfriend..it seems lately that he just can't do anything nice or say anything nice to me anymore. Its really depressing. I don't really understand either. I've done everything that he's wanted and yet i get no thanks in return or anything. But i'm pretty much used to that..well i took my friend Isaiah home today after school then i went out to lunch with stephanie then i had to take my little sisters to the dentist. After that stephanie and I went to the tanning bed...and I fell asleep inside! whoops! At least now i'm not so pale! lol. Then we went back to my house and she got ready for work. So then i dropped her off and came home, ran a mile, did some crunches, and then studied! Great day huh? Tomorrow should be alot better! Can't wait! Well I think that's enough for now! I'll try to be more consisted in updating my journal! Bye!"

We went to outback for dinner....really good!! We saw this guy there that said i was really pretty (awwwww).

Then after dinner we went back to my house to get socks and pee! Then we went bowling!! Yeaaa!! Well there were a bunch of girls next to us that steph and I went to middle school with...they were are really annoying. They thought it was cool to get the ball stuck in the gutter and have the people come and get it out like 28764358762435 times. They were lame. Then this one heffer kept throwing the ball down the lane! They were stupid. And all ugly...some were a little large and wearing some clothing that they shouldn't have been. Anyways after that we were going to go down to the beach but it was packed!! So we made a u turn and drove around and harrassed some people on the phone! It was great!!! So now i'm in bed...i'm really tired and i have to walk up early to go work at the soccer fields for the tournament that's going on there this weekend!!! ttyl everybody!"

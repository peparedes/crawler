"event","<font color=""#00ffff"">So as most of you know I tend to like a lot of guys at one time.&nbsp; I used to think I was just an abnormal person when it came to my (non existant) dating life.&nbsp; However, I have come to a conclusion that seems to serve my 'issues' with guys very nicely.&nbsp; Yes I still like a lot of guys at any given time, but I believe I do this because the likelyhood of the one or two particular guys that I REALLY like reciprocating my feelings are slim to none, at least that has been the case before.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad thing is, when one or more of these many crushes ends up feeling as I do towards that one or another person, I don't know what to do!&nbsp; I don't want to ruin my chances with the guy I really like, even though I've liked him for over a year and nothing has come out of it, by making out with one or another guy.... it didn't happen but it COULD happen..... maybe, but I'm really not sure!&nbsp; It would depend on whether or not I felt like there was something more than just ooooo let's make out.... ya know what i mean.&nbsp;&nbsp; oh what to do.... but overall i feel better about this multitude of crushes.... at least now I have a reason as to why I can like so many guys at once.....&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess my question for people that may read this is do i tell these guys that I REALLY like how I feel about them?&nbsp; Is that always the best case?&nbsp; Will it ruin the relationship I already have with them???&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish I could tell them, and know at least how they feel about me because if they didn't like me at all then yes i would be hurt but on my behalf not theirs, I would eventually move on, and find another guy to like? <br /><br />i'll see</font>"

"event","<font color=""#ff00ff"">hello to all....&nbsp; it's been quite a while since i've written anything down in this for anyone to see.&nbsp; So I have decided to write now since I finally have a day off, well sort of, and just want to write really.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what's new with me:&nbsp; I just started my third year of college at Central, and I couldn't be more excited.&nbsp; Maybe I should back up.... let's recap last year.....my horrifying sophomore year... lol, just kidding, it wasn't horrifying.&nbsp; The year started off with my split with mike which was probably the best thing that happened that year.&nbsp; Not that mike was/is a bad person, it just wasn't working out the way I had hoped.&nbsp; There was a long list of guys that entered and the left my immediate attention... unfortunately.&nbsp; Some of them were great and it would have been interesting had things worked out at all.. but none of them did, even the almost reattempting relationship with mike didn't go far.&nbsp; That was somewhat discouraging but I clearly survived and it definitely helped me realize that i get attached TOO easily and very quickly, so I've been working on that.&nbsp; By the end of the year I was so sick of the male race I didn't want to be with anyone.... unfortunately my usual self got the better part of me come summer, but i'll get back to that later.&nbsp; The one really bad event from last year was the worst disagreement between one of my roommates and i, which has left her and i with no relationship what so ever.&nbsp; That was the most stressful and tension filled time, which unfortunately has yet to be resolved.&nbsp; There were a lot of ups and downs in my life to say the least.&nbsp; Finally though, the year came to an end and i was off on another adventure (after a sad loss of a family memeber).<br />BEAVER ISLAND!!!!!&nbsp; Oh my goodness how did i love that place!&nbsp; It all started on the boat ride over to the island.... what's funny is that i can't even call it a fling or a summer romance or anything of the sort because it simply didn't make it that far.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; It was funny though.&nbsp; Anyways, on the island I took zoology and that in itself was amazing!&nbsp; The first day of lab we were out searching for SNAKES.... WOWZER was that crazy!&nbsp; But boy i tell you what... i had an absolute blast!!!&nbsp; It was the best three weeks EVER!!!!!&nbsp; I met some incredible people, truly incredible people.&nbsp; I wish I could sit here and dive into the details but there is simply too much to write about and not a whole lot of time.&nbsp; yeah... maybe some other time i'll indulge in my memories and share my beaver island experience.&nbsp; Anyways, after the beave was complete I went home for the summer in hopes of making far more money than i did and getting a new car.... haha, one of those things happened... and i'll have to get some pictures up shortly but I was able to make enough money to sustain my small expendature needs throughout the summer but wasn't enough to keep me afloat these past three weeks, which is why I'm sitting here now rather than driving my happy butt home for the weekend.&nbsp; I had a rough summer start though.&nbsp; Someone came back into my life and I as always fell harder than i've fallen in quite a long time, mainly because he was someone i've loved and cared for and wanted back in my life for six years.&nbsp; I know it's pathetic but yet its true.&nbsp; So he was there and then gone again as quick as he had re-entered.&nbsp; VERY heartbreaking for me.&nbsp; but then again, I'm still here so it clearly wasn't quite as devestating as it felt at the time. Plus I came to the conclusion that he was only after one thing and he got it from someone else and so I didn't want him after her anyways.... :o&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that's kind of rude but it's honest.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't too difficult for me to get over it because I had one of my closest friends with me the whole time.... and she's just amazing in herself and makes my days brighter with her smile..... (I love you Jackson!!!!)&nbsp; That may sound weird but I know that we both helped one another through some crap this summer and soooo it's all good in AshleyHOOD!! hahahaha... anywho!&nbsp; He was only a second in the scheme of things... plus I had my kids to watch, my girl to hang out with, my curch, my MA, and so much more to keep me occupied.&nbsp; My summer was meant to be a time where I could truly focus on God.&nbsp; That is another reason why I went home.&nbsp; I wanted to get away from Central and all the temptations I had fallen victim to over the course of the year and get on FIRE for GOD!!!&nbsp; and I did... I made my way up to the 2nd Thursday His House gathering which allowed me to go on a three day trip to marquette to REALLY dive into the word and get my life on track.&nbsp; I'm not saying my life is completely in sync with God but I'm so much better that last year.&nbsp; So summer was an absolute success.&nbsp; However, I was totally pumped to move back to MP and get the year started.&nbsp; So now I've caught you up to three weeks ago and WOW have they gone by fast.&nbsp; The first two weeks I just worked.&nbsp; Every day nine to ten hours a day.... it was FABULOUS.&nbsp; I really enjoy working so it wasn't bad in any way.. well the first couple of days i was a little tired and my feet killed but that passed shortly following.&nbsp; Then classes started on monday and i can't even explain or express how awesome my classes are.&nbsp; I only have four this semester but i also hold a position in the sorority, i am working and part of three other rso's and working on a fourth.... maybe a fifth and sixth by the end of the semester.&nbsp; Who knows what this year will hold.&nbsp; I'm excited for everything and i mean EVERYTHING!!!!&nbsp; Classes, sorority.... I'M TAKING A LITTLE :D, HIS HOUSE AND lifegroup, GOD AND ALL HIS WONDERS.... program board, american chemical society, pre-vet club, hopefully getting another job, getting into tri-beta, rho lambda or order of omega... not sure which one is open to me..... let me think... LIFE!!!&nbsp; I'm FIRED UP FOR LIVING and I know it will be the most successful year EVER!!&nbsp; well at least thus far in my life.&nbsp; sooooo over the past year i left my boyfriend to find myself and came across a lot of lessons I hadn't quite&nbsp;gotten a grasp of through the course of my first year at college and so now I think I'm doing well as far as knowledge goes...&nbsp; I'll try to update more than just once every six months or so and maybe i'll even splurge a little about the island and all it's majesties.... :D&nbsp; Until then, toodles!</font>"

 I want you all to know how amazing you are and how much you deserve from a man, or a friend or whatever!  You all deserve the best of the best.  And that is in all aspects of life!  When it comes to having a relationship with a guy... YOU DESERVE THE BEST!!!!!!  I don't know how else to put this or how many times I'm going to have to tell you but I will continue until you all believe me and believe it yourself!  NOT ALL GUYS ARE PIGS!! There are a lot that are but you just have to wait for the right guy... and if he's your right guy then he'll be worth every second you waited for!  If a guy cheats, he's not worth it.  If a guy doesn't tell you he loves you, or how beautiful you are, how special you are to him, how you've made his life better..... He's NOT Worth your time, your love, your committment!!  If a guy isn't 200% happy with you he's not for you!  This goes for guys too!!  If a guy needs to go elsewhere to have his ""needs"" taken care of, HE'S NOT FOR YOU!!!!  AAAAAHHHHHH!!! I want you all to know this and feel this way too!!!  You deserve to be treated the very best and if you're not then get out.... I'm sorry to say it but I'd rather be alone than not get the respect and love that I want, need, and deserve!!!!  

I guess I'm done for now.... I love you all!!! Have a wonderful and safe weekend, especially if you're driving or cooking!! LOL!  Happy Easter everyone!!!!

Good night!"

I don't know what I was going to say....

I was sooooo tired that I didn't have the energy to eat tonight.

My brother came over today, which was interesting.  I haven't seen him since last summer and I haven't talked to him since Thanksgiving.  We got into it back in October and I didn't tlak to him until Thanksgiving.  It was good though today, talking and just hanging out watchin' some movies.  Mom had surgery yesterday... but everything went ok.  So that's a good thing.  I was worried but I think I knew it would be ok.  and it is, so far.  

I'm soooo tired. 

I really want to have a date for formal but I doubt that happening.  It's probably not even possible now anyways.  I surrender then!  :( 

Well I'm off... to somewhere

good night all!"

"event","I'm just sitting here watching Friday Night Lights.... wow, I didn't even realize it but this is the first movie mike and i saw together way back when.  It was the second day, not even, that we knew each other.  I think it was October 15,2004.  :(  This is going to be ok. I am slowly getting over him.  MA told me today when I was over that someone will come along when I least expect it, and I know she's right. That's generally how it happens with me.  One minute I'm sitting around all worried about nothing and then the next minute I have three 'suiters' all at once.... I don't understand that but oh well.  Anyways, that's not what I got on to talk about... 

Went to Ohio for a few days and that was awesome as always. I witnessed the birth of a calf, the death of another calf and so that was way cool.  Well the death wasn't cool, that really sucked actually.  It was doing well and probably would have made it but we think the mom cow stepped on it or something:(  guinea hens are really really annoying...  

my cousin thought it'd be funny to ask this guy that I like to go to formal with me... grrr.  He said he doesn't do dances... so I probably won't be doing much about that.  I was going to call my cousin and get his number and call him myself but my mom said not to even worry about it so I'm just gonna let it go.  my cousin went dress shopping with my mom and i.... that was funny!  i kept pulling dresses for him and told him that was a good color for him... hahahaha.  I love him!  He's great!  I just wish he didn't have such an attitude problem, I put up with him though.  I give him a hard time every second we're together, but he's pretty good at dishing it out as well.  I sure do miss them, already and I've only been gone a couple days.  I love the farm and can't wait to go back and visit again.  I love going 4-wheelin' with the guys.  Maybe next time I'll ride with Nate since my cousin will probably have his g/f out there.... grrr... I like her but at the same time I don't think he's happy with her.. that makes me sad b/c he deserves and needs a girl to keep him upbeat and positive about things, and she doesn't as far as I can tell. hmmmmm...  

well enough about that.  

I have been looking into Kentucky a lot these past few weeks.  I think that's where I'm gonna live.  Probably near Lexington, aka the Horse Capitol of the World, I am way excited.  And if I can arrange things in time I would LOVE to go down there and work on a farm this summer or work with a vet at the Kentucky Derby. If not then I'll probably stay in MP and try to get in with a vet there. Or I could always come home and work with our 'family' vet even though he's specifically small animal, but there are quite a few vets around here (creek) that do large animal... I'm so excited for this summer!!!  SERIOUSLY!!! 

Ok, I'll be back later.  Mom wants to go... tchao!"

"event","I think it's been a while since I've updated.  I've been on attempting to update but I never did.

So here's what's new... if anything at all!

Boys:
 Well they all pretty much suck.  As most of you know, I can get all wrapped up in a guy at the blink of an eye.  Well yeah, that happened again and as usual it was thrown in my face, sort of, but I guess I can't expect much from guys.  I could say a lot about this but I think it comes down to if you like someone you should just come out and say it, otherwise the other person won't know and you won't know how they feel about the subject either.  The bottom line with this subject is that I'm still in love with Mike and I can't get over him no matter how much I try to like other guys, I always come back to him!  :| It makes me kind of sad.  Therefore, I can't allow myself to truly give into another guy, because I'm still crazy for mike.   So until I either truly get over mike, which i don't know when will really happen, or someone makes a huge impression on me I am single and will remain that way for a long time...and will be caught in this transition phase..... grrr...   Oh but btw, i think it's crazy how my ex from high school calls me and is more interested in my life than anyone else.. wtf?  It's nice to have someone to talk to though! 

Girls:
 I really don't like a lot of girls, well maybe not dislike girls as much as don't get along with girls.  They tend to be overdramatic and for the most part drive me crazy.  Not all girls are like this but the majority of the girls i know drive me a little crazy every so often... I love my sisters (most of them :) lol)  Sometimes I wonder though who took care of the everyday basics that some people just simply do not know how to do.  I'm probably not talking about you if you think I'm talking about you.. it's not anyone that i'm friends with, not really anyways.  if you know me you know who i'm talking about.  However it really isn't limited to this one person, there are more but this one is the worst ever!  OMG! can you say Dirrrrty!!!  lol, hahaha.  It's mean but I seriously don't understand how a person doesn't know how to clean up after themselves. Honestly, did your parents do everything for you from feeding you to washing you??? come on!  Grow UP! Be mature and stop being so flippin' lazy!!!! aaaaahhhhhhhh!!!  I hate cleaning up after people that have no respect for the things they are ruining, and have not gratification that someone else is doing them a favor.  grrrrrr.... ok i'm done!

School:
 I love my classes, and even though I'm crazy busy this semester I couldn't ask for a better and more enjoyable schedule.  I get along with people in my classes, especially my labs!!! Hahaha, unfortuante events but very fortunate at the same time.... haha, stupid boys!  haha, ok, anyways.  I am doing really well in them as well.  That's why I think I enjoy them so much b/c I'm doing well!!  I'm slightly behind in one class but I can overcome that in a short amount of time.  yeah, so that's pretty much all i have to say about that.

Mom:
 well she's ok, but she has to have surgery on friday. It's called a heart cathadarization, which is where they stick a camera up through her veins to check her heart arteries.... yeah it sucks.  Hopefully they won't find anything but if they do they will have to operate... boo! Let's not go into that thought..

rest of family:
 uh.. i don't know really, haven't talked to my sister since we got into a huge arguement and she said a lot of hurtful things to mom and so yeah, don't really talk to her. and brother, well HA, he rarely calls mom and i don't even have his number.  I did call him once over christmas break to find out where the imax was but haven't talked to him since.  neither have gotten their christmas presents b/c amy's came back and ron hasn't had time to meet with mom to pick them up.  grrr... to them both!  THEY SUCK!  so yeah, enough of the bad part of my family!!  I love my mom! :)

what else??

I don't know

I love pb and J... but i miss snowmobiling... :(  Oh and mike totally passed MP TWICE and didn't stop by to say hi.... ;( *suppose to be a crying sad face*

i miss him too... a lot actually!

ok i need to go to the rr... haha... good night everyone!

sweet dreams. I love ya!

"event","Ok so Friday wasn't toooo bad.  I had class, didn't do horribly on my quiz, drove home, went out to dinner with my mom and then went to bed.  THEN, saturday rolled around and I already knew it was gonna pretty much suck... but whatever. Got up early so I could get new tires on my car which was AWESOME!!!  My car drives great now!  Then I got my nails done which is always nice..... then I got a phone call while I was still getting that done from him.... he had this attitude too... and I don't even know why!  He asked me when I was coming over and I said well I don't know I'm almost finished and then I'll be on my way.  I asked him if he was going to be there or if he had somewhere to be and he said Yeah I have plans, so that of course made me mad and I said , fine don't be there I don't care!  Well then I was upset and almost to the point where I would have been crying had I not been watching this crazy tv show called Love Connection from the 80s.  So then she finishes and I pay her and I'm on my way to his house and every flippin song that comes on the radio is a love song, but especailly about missing you and loving you and ugh!!!  Kenny Rogers, I can't unlove you, Faith and Tim, Mariah Carey, Don't forget about us, Keith Urban.... one after another, on different stations too!!! That was slightly frustrating..... Anyways, I'm making my way through the town and I pull in the driveway as I had so many times before.  Get the box of stuff out of my backseat and go up to the door, no one answers... So I go inside the garage and knock on that door.  His mom answers and I'm just standing there thinking, what do I do? Am I even welcome to come it?  She invites me in and then tells him I'm there....  So then he comes up and goes to get my stuff....of course he didn't have it all together in a pile like he told me, well he told me it was all together.  I probably wasn't there but ten minutes, if that.  I gave him back the one ring he gave me that was his grandpas and then i tried to give him back the ring he bought me.... But he wouldn't take it. So I sat it on the stove... then i put it on the counter and he put it back in my pocket.. so I put it back on the counter and told him I can't keep it and by this time I'm shaking and almost crying so I walk out the door with my stuff and get my shoes. I should have walked outside without putting my shoes on but I didn't and then he followed me into the garage and dropped it in my purse!!!  Oh and while I was standing in the kitchen his g/f decided to take a trip to the bathroom.... she's cute but she looks young.  Guys tend to go for the younger ones!  but whatever!!!!  So he went back inside and I was kind of crushed because I don't think I'll ever see him again, and He OBVIOUSLY doesn't understand that.  So I went to my car and drove away as quickly as I could.... ;( I'm really sad!  And of course since I still have the ring, I'm wearing it!  That's stupid I know... I guess I have to give up one thing at a time.... first I gave him up as my b/f... then as my friend.... then stuff he gave me.... lastly I'll have to give up this ring.. but it's more than just a ring to me.  It represents our life we had planned on having together.... wedding, kids, family, life...our life, that for now is just a memory. And this ring, well, I guess when I can part with it, I can part with that hope of having him be the man I want him to be and know he can be... then man of my dreams. ;(;(  This really sucks!  

Then of course my mom tells me I just have to let go of him and HA!  that's much easier said than done!  Just like I told him, I don't know how to get my heart back from him.  And until I do, he has it and I can't give it to anyone else!  I can't love someone else when I'm still in love with him.... it just doesn't work that way!  Not for me!

Ok I need to stop this and study!!! Good night!"

"event","I'm a little frustrated because well I don't know if I'm frustrated with myself because I let people get to me or if I'm frustrated with other people because they get so upset over things that aren't that big of a deal.  I realize I'm a very unique person when it comes to my thoughts and actions.  I do get angry with people and at certain situations but then I get over it!  Sometimes I do hold a grudge but if I do it's a serious matter, not some petty arguement over the internet!  I don't HATE people, I can't!  It's not in me to hate!  I feel bad for people who don't know what it's like to not hate someone, anyone but I can't help it.  I just CAN'T hate someone!  I generally enjoy people, but sometimes yes people make me soooo angry that I say stupid things like...AAAAAHHHH I hate people...  it's not true though... I don't hate people, I do dislike some but never hate... However those select few that I don't like are from high school and another that only a few know about!  So I know this one small characteristic of my personality sets me apart.  That's fine, no big deal....   AAAAAHHHHH i don't know what i want to say or where i'm going with this!!!

I am ok though, I'm not mad about last night, I was upset last night but geezz.... I've slept since then!  I'm over it!  it's fine, but other ppl don't know how to let things go.

LIFE IS FAR TOO SHORT!!!  

JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET OVER IT!  

THERE'S NO USE IN BEING ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING, (QUICK SIDE NOTE.... BONNIE RAITT HAS MAD GUITAR SKILLS!!!!!!!)  ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SOMETHING IS ALREADY OVER AND IN THE PAST!!!  WE CAN'T CHANGE IT SO THERE'S NO REASON TO HOLD ONTO IT!!!

"event","So I really need to get a life and stop crying over people, but I think I will be able to overcome this.  I know that lately I haven't really been putting myself out there to get involved with someone else.  I know I am upset b/c he has and is successful, which I can understand why... I mean they are the same reasons I love him and dated him and stuck with him for so long.  But I can't be angry that he's trying to get over me... I just wish I could do that, so maybe part of me is jealous, not because he has another g/f but because he's been able to reach out to another girl.. something that I haven't really tried to do since we have been apart.  Perhaps if I tried to really date people I may find someone I have an interest in and could maybe some day  start a realationship with. I don't know if this is making any sense to anyone but it sort of makes sense to me.  I am absolutely head over heels for him still, and perhaps I always will be.  He was my first everything and that kind of sticks with a person.  However, though things may not have worked out now, they may in the future.  I can't hold my breath but it's definitely something I may be able to look forward to.  Yet I can't hold back from living and trying to fall in love or have strong feelings for another guy.  I know this is not formatted in a reasonable way whatso ever but that's ok... bottom line is I have to stop crying over him.  I can't do that to myself anymore.  I have been sad and down about him for months now and no matter who I'm around I am reminded of him and long for him to be here with me.  But I can't do that anymore.  He's trying to move on with his life and I should too.  I know this is going to be very difficult because I don't know how a person can expect to give their heart to someone when it's completely devoted to another person. I can try though, I suppose anyways.  I wish I could unlove him but I don't know how fast of a process that is going to be.  So maybe if I take the next step and try to date or at least meet other people that will help the process go faster.  Part of why I think I miss him is because I feel so alone all the time and that feeling sucks really bad.... and you would think it's a hard thing to feel when you live with eight other people but it's really not that friendly sometimes.  And even though I have my sisters, it's not the same kind of loneliness.  And it really makes me feel single when my friends are all getting engaged and are happily in a relationship.... ugh!!  I'm soo happy for them, they are all truly blessed and they most definitely deserve it... I need to stop dwelling on the dreams we had together and try to move on... I guess that's it for now!  I have to go do laundry!!"

"event","So Sunday I was GREAT!!!  I went to church, saw a gorgeous man that any girl would love to be with!!  Then I find out he is no longer single!   Of course at first I blow this news off b/c he didn't mention it to me and he gave me a hug and made a very nice comment and I was on cloud 9!!  Then the course of the day went on and that night was the Christmas program at church!  I watched their practice, thinking it was the actual thing because i was misinformed but I didn't mind being at church that extra hour!  I wish I could be there now!  At least when I'm there I'm happy!  most of the time!  Anyways, as the program went on, the real program not the practice, I watched this little boy on front of me!  He wasn't very old at all, maybe 8 or so.  Well there was this little girl that was sitting there too, well she wasnt at first but after her part was done in the play she went to sit with her dad, i'm assuming.  Anyways, so this little girl goes up to the little boy and gives him a hug and then he pulls her up into his lap to finsih watching the play and he wraps his arms around her and all i can do is cry!!!   Then when MA was up on the stage I could hear her voice and I could see her expression and she was on the verge of tears so that just added to my crying!  The thing about MA is that she is my life support!  She is the woman that is teaching me to be a better Christian and a better woman!  A Christain woman! A woman of God... whichever way you put it!  She is like my second mom, which is crazy since I've been an absolute mess over her son since i was a junior in high school!!!  I know it's crazy... anyways back to the little girl and boy!!  I started crying over this display of love and caring because I know that a long time ago my brother and I had that kind of relation ship!!  We even had that kind of relationship when I went to visit him in texas when I was a junior.  One day we hung out at the pool all day and i had six mike's hard lemonade and after being out in the sun all day I had the worst headache in the world.  Well my brother had plans that night and we were all going to go to his friends house for a BBQ but because I didn't feel well he decided to stay home instead of leave me at his apartment!  I remember crying then too because I hadn't seen my brother for at least two years before that at my grandmothers funeral and I was crying because I was soooo happy to have him back in my life!  Now he lives forty-five minutes away from me and I rarely see him, speak to him, anything!  We got into a huge arguement over stupid crap back in sept-oct and then on thanksgiving day my mom called him or he called her and he talked to me for over half an hour out of the blue!  I hadn't heard from him in over a month... The thing is that it makes me sad because I love him with all of my heart and I saw him more when he lived in Texas, now that he has a good job he acts like he's too good for me and my mom!  I have cried over this for so long and the pain doesn't go away!  I told him how i felt and how all i ever wanted from him was his time!  Not anything more!  I don't care about materialistic things... all I've ever wanted was my family!  And still 13 years after he left, I still don't have it!  My family is a disaster and I can't change it!   After my grandpa died, my family fell apart!  He was our backbone, our strength and ever since he's been gone we've all grown further and further apart! 
So then after the program was done I was still as emotional as ever and this wonderful guy came up to me while i was already on the verge of tears to invite me to his place to celebrate his birthday with some friends and his g/f.... then i walked downstairs and trying to hold the tears back ran in to Special(you know who you are)....whom gave me a huge hug without me saying a single word.  It's not that hard to see when I'm sad but still, it meant a lot to me!  Then I went upstairs and helped set up for Make-it-Monday!  Went out side and cried for fifteen minutes while my car warmed up!  I don't even know Exactly what I was crying about but I couldn't stop!  Finally I sucked it up and started driving home.. well I didn't keep it sucked up.. the tears just kept falling.... I was driving away and since we just moved that saturday I went past the road I am now living on and headed towards the old place.  Then MA called me and we talked for a few minutes while I was making a circle back to the road I was suppose to turn on five minutes ago!  Then I came to that road and I decided I needed to talk to MA and headed back towards her house!  When I got there I went all through the house and then found her in the basement and just cried... I told her I just can't stop... so for the next five minutes she just let me cry and occasionally had to tell me to breath...lol.  I was there for a good two hours or so crying and talking and crying and eating some.... steve was suprisingly friendly...he's been weird lately but maybe it was because when he saw me I was crying my eyes out!  It was nice to get a glimpse of the steve I know!  MA and I talked the whole time I was there about everything and I told her that what I think caused this emotional breakdown is because after 'losing' another potential guy I was reminded that all the men in my life leave me!  Not in the way you may think but I never met my dad, my brother moved out of the house and went into the Air Force when I was seven, my grandpa died, my sisters b/f then husband was removed from my life when i moved to michigan with my mom and then her ex was gone too (not that I particularly wanted him to be in my life but still he was there for over ten years of my life, which is over half and now he's not)  Then I fall for these guys and lose them!  I never have them but it makes me feel like I've lost them when they don't reciprocate the same feelings I have!  So she told me just to wait!  Wait for him!  She told me that the reason I get like this over some guys, not all but a few, is because the one thing I desire more than anything in this whole world is to have a husband.  I know I'm only twenty but it's true!  I've always been afraid that I would never get married and have a family of my own!  That is the deepest desire of my heart!  I want to have that kind of love in my life.  I don't know who doesn't want that but for me that is the only thing I need.  I don't care about the 'riches' of the world.. I simply want a man to love me.  A good Christian man!  I don't want him to leave me!  And falling for these guys that could possibly be that man and then them not feel like that for me tears me apart!  Then don't mean to and I don't hold any grudges against them but it still hurts!  I know in my head that there is someone for me and that someday he will walk into my life or I will walk into his but no matter how much I tell my heart that it just doesn't understand and aches uncontrollably!  I don't know how long I'll be able to wait for this dream man of mine!!!  Not if I fall apart everytime I think, hear, see, anything that has to do with love!  UGH!! sometimes being a girl is the harshest thing God did to me! LOL!  I'm glad I have emotions like this but I'm not at the same time!  I would rather be emotional than numb to everything around me!  This is a sad time of the year for me I guess because it's all about love and family... two things that I want but don't necessarily have!  I havea family but we haven't spent a Christmas together since i was about six years old!  I have the love of many but I don't have the love of my life!!!  I'm grateful for what I do have and know that I will once have the love of my life and the family I've always dreamed of... I just have to wait for them!!!  But like I said I don't know how long I will be able to wait!!  I'm just this massive amount of emotion will settle once I'm back at school and I'm not faced with these everyday, as in I won't have time to think about them or worry about them.  Until them.... well I'll try to cheer up and look on the bright side of things, be as optomistic as I can be but underneath it all well i'm still a little sad!  



I know that's a lot and so if you actually read through it Thanks, I hope it wasn't to confusing.  If you didn't read through it and you're just reading this.. it's ok, I know I like to write a lot! I guess my Christmas wish for 2005 is to just let go of all of this emotion and saddness... I don't want people to look at me and just know that I'm aching inside!!!  

Well I am going to bed I think!  Maybe!  lol.. good night everyone!

Merry Christmas!!!"

"event","I don't know why I can't get over this??? I need to be over this!!  I can't go on about this forever, I just need to let it go!  But I don't know how!!! I really don't!  I'm going to be sad about this for all of eternity and that's bad!  I just need something to take my mind off of it and capture me!!  But there is no replacing it!  NOTHING IS THAT AMAZING!!  NOTHING!  I should be used to not getting the things my heart most desires... I suppose I'll always be stuck in this mode!  I wish I could change it!  I wish I could but I don't because then other people wouldn't be happy and I know that their happiness is more important!  I will just have to accept it and try to move on!  This is more difficult than I thought it would be b/c i THOUGHT i was OVER IT!!!  But I don't know anymore... it still hurts... it's like a slap in the face.. you're not good enough!  I know that's not it, I know I am.... but I'm not right i guess!  This is depressing!   I SERIOUSLY need to get over it!  NOW!! THIS INSTANT!  yeah right... if i can't get over it within two years i don't think it's gonna happen!  UGH!   I do everything to myself, your right andy!  I do!  I'm the idiot who thinks and wants the impossible!   It never fails!  I just want to be rid of this mind, these thoughts, these wants, these worries!  I don't know why i worry, i know it will NEVER happen!  Not to me!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  I hate this feeling by the way!
I'm exhausted!!!  I need to go to the farm, that will take my anxieties away!!! I miss the farm!  I can't wait to go down for the family reunion... It's MY Family, the name I've wanted as my own since i can remember!  I am finally going to a family reunion that Is MY family!!  I've only had to wait 20 years!!  I think I may cry!  So much emotion.... I almost started crying yesterday morning when i was reminded of a friend's dad and how he used to get charlie horses out of my calves... those suckers hurt like no other... well i had one in my foot the other night and that's what reminded me of him b/c my foot still hurt!  I think it's crazy how people are gone not only from my life but my two closest friends...  I always envied them because they had their families... mom dad brothers or sisters, or both!  and all i had was my mom, but that's enough!  she's all i need really!  That's why i just want to get over this!  It should be over but i just can't let it go for some reason and i don't know why!  I really dont!  UGH!!  
I am sooo tired so i think i'm going to try and sleep!  I'll see how far that goes!  Good night everyone!"

"event","I don't know what to do with my sister!  She sits and aks like my mom beat her with a shovel and threw her in the basement.  All she has is hatred and all these other kinds of feelings, unhappy feelings, when it comes to our mom and I don't know what to do.  She says she has God in her life, but how can she?  How can she sit her and tell me that our mom never loved her or supported her or cared for her or befriend her!  I don't know what the heck she is talking about.  What do I say to her?  How do I respond to the accusations?  No my mom couldn't support her financially when she moved out but it was her choice to move out!  It's not my mom's fault she was an idiot and moved out of her house when she was barely 17!!!  She couldn't stand being there so she had to leave and make a life with her b/f and then ended up getting divorced and somehow that was our moms fault too??  Who does that?  Then she says she can't respect the fact she is a stronger person because of what she went through, she doesn't owe any gratitude to our mom!  I'm not asking her to gravell (sp) at her feet.. I'm asking her to write mom on the envelope instead of her first name!  Is that tooo much to ask?  All I've ever wanted since I was seven was to have a family again.  Then I lost more of it when I turned eleven and that is still a dream of mine!  I've always wanted to have my family here for the holidays.  I was blessed to spend Christmas with my sister once after she moved out and I've been blessed to share Christmas with my brother for a couple years now!!  Why can't we all be in the same room?  I just don't understand!!  I can't see how my sister views this whole situation!  I don't know what she's talking about, the woman she describes is not the woman that we call mom!  She's not the woman I call mom!  Yeah she was hard on me, for a lot of things, but I'm smart enough to see that she only wanted me to be happy!  She loved me and cared for me more than anything in the entire world and wanted only the best of the best for me!  How am going to have a relationship with my sister when we constantly battle over the one person that has been with me my entire life?  I just don't know what I am suppose to do!  This makes me severely sad!  What do I do?"

You know that ideal love that each of us dreams of from childhood? That's you!
Not because you posess all of the ideal characteristics, but because you are a savvy shape shifter.
You have the uncanny ability to detect someone's particular fantasy... and make it you.

You inspire each person to be an idealist and passionate, and you make each moment memorable
Even a simple coffee date with you can be the most romantic moment of someone's life
By giving your date exactly what he or she desires, you quickly become the ideal lover.

Your abilities to make dreams come true is so strong, that you are often the love of many people's lives.
Your ex's (and even people you have simply met or been friends with) long to be yours.
No doubt you are the one others have dreamed of... your biggest challenge is finding *your* dream lover.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>


Haha, this is hilarious!!  But it's soo true!  At least that's how I see things!  This is why I get into so many crappy situations!  Guys generally fall for me, hard!  and I don't know, it's sooo weird to me.  In high school I ALWAYS said that a guy would like me if he got to know me!  I just knew I had a captivating personality, that may make me seem a bit arogent(SP) but it's not.  I'm not like that, but I did have confidence in my personality!  I get along with just about everyone that I've met.  Yes there are some that I just don't get along with but it's not because I'm a bad person.  Those few people have done horrible things to me and even though I've gotten over them, there is just an uneasiness between us, and they may still be holding grudges but I think that's the most idiotic thing a person can do!  Anyways, now that I have the 'looks' along with my personality I seem to attract very creepy people, and get into unfortunate situations.  After last night, I think I'm DONE!!  Done with guys, and something else, which interferes with so much!  I know, well I hope, that I will find the one and only that was put on this earth for me.  It's possible that I've already found him but I keep failing the tests that God faces me with.  Which makes me believe that He is keeping his identity from me until I can control myself and my life.  I have crazy realizations when I miss out on a whole day because of unfortunate feelings!  I know it probably doesn't make any sense to some people but I know what I mean, which is all that matters!  The moral of my realization is that I am going to try my hardest to stop thinking about liking guys and worrying about who they are interested in.  If a guy doesn't like me it's his loss, if he does then he is going to have to tell me, because I'm not going to be looking for any signals, not that they would be clear anywasy, but that's not the point!  I'm just done with guys in general!  I think that's a good thing for me... boys just cause problems and complications!  We are better off, well at least I am, for a while!  LOL!  This makes me feel so much better!  I need to study now!  Tchao!"

"event","Ok so I am in such an odd mood.  I'm not sad but I'm not necessarily happy!  I think I'm just boared with the routine I'm in!  I need to be working on so many things but I just don't feel like it!  This is bad for me!  I can't be like this if I'm going to do well in my classes!  Next semester is probably going to kill me... calculus, chemistry, botany, sociology, and religion.... plus I'm probably going to be taking a little sister in my sorority which is exciting but stressful at the same time!  I'm excited for spring break though!  A bunch of us are going to Florida b/c one of the girl's family has a timeshare! That will be a good break in the semester.  Let's see what else is going to be going on... oh yes.. Sib's Weekend and we will most likely be having a major concert and comedien next semester for Program Board.  I'm finally going to go to the pre-vet club meetings and get involved more with my career!  That will be good for me to do.  UGH!  I don't know what to talk about!  I have nothing!  All I can think about is what I need to be doing!  SO I guess I'm going to stop putting it off and actually work on my homework/ studying for finals!  YIPPEE!!!"

"event","Ok so my last entry I said I was disappointed for my mood, but I think I need to take that back, b/c I'm most definitely not crying... plus I shouldn't be disappointed, I asked for something and God gave it to me!!!  I should be rejoicing!!! It amazes me how quickly God can answer some prayers!!!  I had a little convo with Him last night and already two prayers have been answered... It hasn't even been 24 hours!  This is great!  I need to celebrate!! Haha, after I do my homework!!!  I have sooo much of that it's not even funny!!  The end of the semester is crazy for me!! Only b/c I mess everything up and now I have to fix it but still they are crazy anyways!  So this is what I have to do!  I have FIVE finals in two weeks, two other exams that I have to take but that's b/c I have to make them up!  I have two presentations to make, one in my speech class and one in my french class!!  Is that not insane??  I think so! I guess it's not too bad once I write it all out.... oh except I have seven exams.... ugh!  Wait.. I have six exams b/c I just took my final for my speech class... it wasn't pretty.. talk about a twenty percent difference from the first exam... :( I thought I'd do so well... I should have known it wasn't goign to work and I would mix stuff up, but it seemed like I was doing soo well!  DANG IT!!!  Oh well, I can't do anything about it.  I'll still get an A in the class, I just wish I would have done better on the final!  I have two hours b/4 my lab.. I need to read over that and answer the questions so I will do that now!!  I enjoy writing in this, Helps me figure things out sometimes!!!  Anyways!!!  Adios muchachos!!!  haha, i don't really know what that says!!
HA i love it when i can make myself laugh at myself!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... <-- that's what I'm called at home.. lol.  sometimes and mainly by MA... HA and MA and HE... haha... that's too funny!! I love you AMANDA!!!  Call Me sometime!! I'll make you laugh.. see how goofy I am..
See this is how I really am!! If you think you only see the sad side of me, just imagine my happy side... It has no stress in it, b/c i'm not worrying about boys!!  Thanks God, I need this break!!!!! 
Ok I'm really going now!!"

"event","I just wish people, especially guys, would be straight forward with you about what they are thinking and how they feel!!!  Thanksgiving was great!!!  Got to go home and see a bunch of people.  My brother actually talked to me, civilly (sp). I had an interesting evening with my ex... I can't believe how it ended... I'm really stupid sometimes!  Stupid Stupid Stupid!!!!  What was I thinking?  Honestly!  I finally get out of the relationship and now I'm... I'm just stupid!!!  I don't think I should be allowed to be around guys!  I don't know what to do with any of you!  Andy has my mind going in circles, I've got my mind going in circles over Mike.... UGH!  I was finally getting to a point where I was ok with being single and I didn't need to be around guys that liked me and then we threw Andy in the mix and now I'm all frazzled again!  I hope that by doing this bible study with Amanda and then hopefully leading another with the young girls in my church will help me overcome these boy issues.  Maybe Andy is right, maybe I am doing this to myself but I just don't understand what the deal is?  Do you like me, do you not like me?  Which is it?  Just tell me.  Don't invite me over and to other places, to dinner and then tell me your not doing anything!!!! AAAAAHHHH, I could kick you.... I did kick you!  But I'll more than gladly do it again!
Anyways,  As for you little miss Amanda!!!! I love you hunny and as you can see the boy issues don't go away and usually only get worse as you get older... yet they are still not worth a single tear!!!  I know you're hurtin' my dear but it will get better.  It took me almost two years to get over ""BRAD"" <--- haha, that's funny!!!  And I never dated him, so it may take you more or less time.  I think it took me so long because I didn't have any Godly support here at school, but at home I think I would have been fine because I would have had you and MA and other church people!  So I think once we start this bible study we will be able to work together and get over our Andys!!! haha that's funny too!  ( I realize your going to read this Andy but I don't know any other way to say it to you!!! You knew how I felt before, why are you playing with my head and my emotions???)  I wish I could tell this to your face but I didn't know what to say or how to say it! I don't know how you feel or what you are thinking...I don't get you!!!))  Anyways, back to Amanda!!!  We will overcome this together!!!  We both know this 'new you' isn't really you and I know we can get rid of this negativity you're carrying around with you!  We will help each other, you will get out of this blah mode and I will get out of this confused mode and we will both GROW as Christians together, something we both need, obviously!  :) 

As for life at school... well honestly, I wish I weren't at Central most of the time!  I wish I was home with my friends and family and not surrounded by the drama of sorority life!!!  But I have to admit I've learned a lot of valuable lessons being here at school rather than at home!!  Unfortunately they are hard and sad lessons to find out.  There are a lot of fake people in the world and I see it more and more in people and I don't know why!  I realize it's difficult to tell people the truth because you're afraid it will hurt them or make them angry or you don't want to know their reactions.... but in all honesty telling the truth creates a lot less drama than not telling the truth! People are just fake.  That's one thing I love about this one particular person... she's not fake at all.  She says exactly what's on her mind and she doesn't really care what people think about her.  She's very brave I think!  I'm scared shitless to tell people what I think about them...I guess that makes me fake too?  But I don't go around talking crap about the people... I have before but lately I've been trying really hard to be honest with people... Sometimes I just don't know what to say to people!  Like Nikki!!!  I love you to death and I hate that we haven't talked in ages it seems but I don't know what to say to you!  I feel like you hate me!  I don't say this to you because I don't want to upset you!  I am sorry for everything that happened with Brenden!  I""M SOOOOOOO SORRY!  If I ever thought for a moment this would be the result of some guy it would have never happened... I don't even know why it happened to begin with... I barely even speak to him now!  You are sooo much more important to me than some guy!  SOOOOOO MUCH MORE!!!  I am sorry!  I made a huge mistake, I'm a horrible judge of character I know!  Please forgive me!  I know you say it doesn't matter and that you're over it but that's not the feeling I get when I'm around you!  
Let's see, what else is there??  I don't know... I got side tracked and now I can't think about what I was thinking... haha, I was in a specific mode and I've lost it....


Well I'm a little scared about this whole leading a bible study!!  I know that was somewhere in my thoughts!  I don't know if I'm a good leader for these young girls.  I haven't even completed my own bible study, how am I going to lead one?  Is this too much of a jump for me?  I mean I've been a leader at VBS for three years but is that good enough?  Should I wait and try to do a bible study first?  I'm so excited about this, I really think it will do me good.  It will force me to snap out of this crappy mode I'm in and get me focused on God and the kind of example I need to be for these young girls.  I need to dive deep into prayer about this one because I can't turn back once I get started and I can't let these girls down.  I know I can be a good and positive influence on them and give them a good female role model b/c I know a few of them don't have a mother around so they don't have a lot of feminine connections!  I want to be that for them, and yes it is a big role but I think I can do it!  I have faith in myself, I don't for a lot of things but for this I do!  Plus if I struggle with any of it I have so many people to turn to, not to mention God!  He can help with anything I'm unsure about!  which is precisely why i need to be praying about this!  I have a few weeks... i'll just have to see what happens... I'm nervous though, but I think it will be good!  I know that it will be good if I can do it and be focused on it!  

I know there was more on my mind but I cannot think of what those things were!!  I guess I could stop writing, it's only 3:20 in the morning!!!  That's a good update I think!!!  If I think of something else I had planned on writing about I'll come back!!! haha!  Sweet dreams all!"

"event","Ok, so last night was AWESOME!!!  I was super way excited about a particular person to attend a particular party.  He told me he was going to be there and people kept telling me go call and see when he's going to be here, blah blah blah.  I said no I still have a while before the time frame he gave me is over.  So I was all giddy about it.  Ask anyone, I was flipping out that he actually was going to come...........I couldn't believe it.  Yeah, he came alright.  I was glad he came but at the same time I didn't understand why he even wasted his time to say the five sentences he did to me.  Apparently I'm not a great conversation.  A couple people said that he's keeping his distance because he really likes me and doesn't want a relationship so he backs off..I don't know if I believe that though.  I just don't understand why he doesn't talk to me when we are face to face.  I'll admit at the game I barely choked out ""Hi!""  but last night,  I invited him to come and so unless he went and talked to matt about the party I was the only reason he initially came.  I guess I'm just not that interesting.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS!!!  I wish I could take every feeling I have for him, lock in a steel safe and burry it under a sky scraper in China... then I could just be like him and blow it off."

I regret not going through Jump last year and it's way exciting that I now know that the girls were P.O.ed last year when they found out I dropped... I'm glad I was wanted.  This popcorn is super yummy.  Oh my gosh... so tonight, my beloved Hillary decided it would be funny to ask her best guys friends if they remembered me from high school... it was cool to find out that they do remember me, but it's not cool because she may disclose some information that I provided to her about me and these guy friends that wouldn't be good coming out....but I don't think they would recognize me if they saw me...  But I love that Hill and I can reflect on high school together.   It's great fun to talk about people we know and love and miss and all of the good times we had together... I miss SC like WHOA!!!   But I'm at a very happy point in my life.  I sort of got my job back as a dispatch for drunk taxi,  I'm just going to be on call for now but that's gooooood money so I am not going to complain.  YEAH!!  I loved working there, it was just inconvenient over the summer.  But hopefully there aren't any hard feelings and I can get back into the swing of things.....i'm on such a sugar high.... omg.  tooo much cheesecake tonight, plus the super delicious punch....and now i'm devouring an entire bag of popcorn.... definitely a deepher....

"event","I sometimes hate being single.  I love being with someone more than anything but when I'm single I get to flirt and hang out with whoever I want.  But I've been single for not even a month yet and there are so many guys that are either interested in me or that I'm interested in.  It's so overwhelming. I don't know what to do.  I don't want to step on anybody's toes by hanging out with the ""wrong"" people.  I just want to be whatever with whoever.  But it seems like that doesn't work.  I am not used to this college guy/girl relationship where you hang out and your just friends.  I never did that in high school.  If I was hanging out with a guy it was because I was his girlfriend.  I don't know how to act in this relationship, especially when I know they like me. Or if I know I like them.  This isn't refering to just one person either.  There are two.  One likes me a lot but he kind of freaked me out so I am not so much interested, not like that anyways.  The other I like a lot, and I am pretty sure he likes me too, but at the same time I don't know how to act in this situation.  I have NEVER, EVER been around a guy that I like and he likes me back but there isn't anything between us but friendship.  I don't know how to take this.  I'm so confused because I just want to run up to him and give him a hug or something but I don't know if that would be acceptable.  Should I just say hi, should I avoid him altogether?  I just don't know.  I don't want a relationship right now, with anyone, so it's not like I'm trying to hook up with him but I just don't know how to act.  I don't feel comfortable around anyone right now. I just want to lock myself in my room so I don't have to be around anything.  I know that I'm obsessing about this way to much but it's all I can think about.  Especially this week being recruitment, I am surrounded by it everyday.  And I don't want anyone to think that I don't want to hang out with them or I don't want to be around them, I just want this bad aura to go away.  I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't want to hurt myself either.  I just want to be happy but I don't want to hurt someone else just so I can be happy either.  I would rather be unhappy in my life then make someone else be unhappy.  If that makes any sense.  And now I feel bad because I am being a jerk about it and won't go over to hang out with these people because I think it will be to awkward for them and for me.  I don't wish that it didn't happen but I just wish the circumstances didn't suck so badly.  I don't know what else to say without repeating myself a hundred times so I am going to stop talking....I have lots of french to do... goodnight.."

"event","I don't understand why everyone has to get involved with something that only really includes a few people.  When twelve people get involved in a situation that only really has anything to do with three, the situation gets blown out of proportion and gets SCREWED UP!!!  I hate gossip and everything that goes along with it. It messes everything up.  Don't talk about something you know nothing about.  And if you don't know then don't assume that something is going on or whatever, just ask the people involved.  It's that simple.  When all these other extra people get involved, no one knows the truth or where what story came from who.  If you have an issue with someone about anything, GO TO THAT PERSON....IT'S THAT SIMPLE!!  It really is, I swear it.  I know that when stuff happens and a lot of emotions are surrounding the situation it's hard not to find out what is going on but it truly FUCKS EVERYTHING UP!!!  GIRLS SUCK!!  It's the cold hard truth.  But we do.  I know I am one of them but when something happens and a person tells you in confidence you don't go tell someone else...it's not that difficult to let the two people that it involves to sort it out. I realize now that I can't trust people to keep things to themselves and I hate that because I really thought I could depend on certain people to keep something to themselves.  Something that could easily have been discussed between the people it actually involves has now become a huge fiasco because people don't know how to keep their mouths shut, apparently I'm guilty of that too because I went to someone because I didn't know what to do and what I told them was then relayed to the person I needed to talk to before anyone.  Why do people do shit like that.  DAMN YOU ALL!!  I'm not so much angry that you went and told the person but now you give me dirty looks and barely speak to me, why?  I didn't do anything to you directly.  I know that when something involves your friends you feel as though it involves you, but it doesn't!  If you have an issue with me come talk to me, don't ignore me, that just makes me more angry!!!  So please come talk to me so we can get over this since instead of three original people it now involves at least six!!!"

"event","Today is exactly one week from when I watched someone I call my brother play a solo at his graduation and walk across the stage to accept his diploma.  It is one week from when he tricked me to look down at my shirt as if there was something on it as he was bringing up his finger to get my nose. It is one week since I saw his beautiful smile and felt his arms around me in one of his great hugs.  It is six days since a wonderful person has been stolen from us all.  Six days since no one will be tricked to look down at their shirt.  Six days since the world has lost this dear person to me.  It has only been three days that I've known of this tragedy. Then the next day I had to say my final goodbyes to this person I loved so much, along with a few hundred others.  However, Dustin Lee Grush Kinder did not only touch the lives of a few hunderd people.  His powerful spirit has touched far greater numbers and will continue to change people and make them smile.  His smile can light up a room, his smile could steal a girls heart, his smile can make the worst day be forgotten if only for a moment.  When you were around this amazing person he captured you to where nothing else was going through your mind except him.  He did that to me.  He captured my heart the first time I met him and has been a part of my life since.  I first loved Dustin as someone I wanted to be with forever as a partner rather than a friend and even though I never had the pleasure to be with him in that way, my love for him never changed.  After realizing Dustin and I weren't meant to be I still viewed him as a friend that I would share many memories with.  Now my dear friend is gone but the memories we have made will last a lifetime and more. Dustin is the type of person that will never be forgotten and will never be loved or missed any less than he is today.  There has never been a bad memory of Dustin and there never will be.  Dustin, I love you and I will miss you forever.  God bless you!

Well, I'm not sure when I last wrote or what was going on in my life but as far as today goes....my mom just had surgery to get rid of cancer.  Everything went really well and so hopefully she'll have a fast recovery.  And she stopped smoking which has been in my prayers for so many years....thank God she finally quit.  I'm super happy about that.  So family is doing ok.  Friends.... well outside of my sisters, I think I have the worst friend in the world award wrapped up.  I don't know how my sisters deal with it.  I seem to always cast my two best friends aside.  It's like I just expect them to always be there for me even when I'm not there for them....it's a wonder I still have friends.  I'm the worst procrastinator in the world and that's because I seem to procrastinate the worst when it's really important.  Calling people just never seems to happen when it should...at least not in a timely manner.  And then my roommate... she must really hate me... i just left her there.  I don't see her hardly at all and we are suppose to live in the same room.  I'm just crazy, that's insane crazy not the other kind...I've lost things that I can't get back but I just keep pushing them aside.  I just hope that when I really need them they don't cast me away like I've done to them.  Sisters.... well I've pushed them aside for a while now too...especially my BiG.... but I'm coming around more and more which is good because I need to be there for one thing and I enjoy being there for another thing.  But GREEK WEEK is coming up soon and then FORMAL!! YEAH!  I'm way excited about both events... I'm gonna have a ball!  And formal...uh I can't wait, it will definitely blow my disaster prom out of the water.  Which brings me to my boyfriend.... well he's kinda the reason everything else has been pushed aside...but i've decided that I can spend time with people other than him... not that I don't enjoy being with him all the time because it's really nice but I loved going out with my sisters, and I completely and totally miss my best friends. And I know for the most part that my sisters miss me, I'm pretty sure my roommates do but I'm never around long enough to find out.  WOW! I suck as a friend...i really do.  Some day this is going to bite me in the ASS!  Ok..well i'm getting a little talked out... i'm not sure what to say.... i would say some things but I'll just keep those few thoughts to myself... or i'll write another day...LOL.. night ya'll"

And so now he doesn't want to get involved with me b/c it would be conditional and he doesn't want a possible future wife to have conditioned love...  So i told him that MY LOVE IS UNCONDITIONAL... i have never not loved a person b/c of what they believed.  Yes i would love to be with a christian b/c i think that would be an incredible relationship and that's what i want.  However, i have never turned anyone down b/c of their religion or lack of.  So that's the first thing... the second thing is... I've known mike for two months and who's to say that we are/aren't going to get married.  I told him that if i was with anyone for a long enough period to be seriously thinking about marriage i don't know if i would turn them down if they weren't a christian.... What am i suppose to do?  I don't get it.. last weekend he was telling me that he loves me and he even told me that two days ago... now all of a sudden out of the clear blue he's talking about religion... i mean yeah it's great he's thinking about it but honestly...

That doesn't seem to be everyone elses deal.  So i met mike oct 14 and ever since then we have spent almost every night together b/c we just had so much fun and we had a lot in common.  Everything is great.  Yeah!  Well then i learn about his girlfriend from home. And i've already been through that ordeal with you... however, i kinda felt like he never really broke up with her even though he said he did.  I still don't know i guess.  Well anyways, we get back from thanksgiving and things go back to the way they were. and it's great... i love seeing him and spending time with him and just being next to him makes me feel good.  Ok so all is good.  Then last weekend he goes through so much trouble to tell me something that i totally didn't expect..he told me he loves me.  i was like whoa..... i did a triple take and was so surprised i couldn't say anything... finally i told him that i felt the same.  it was great... but for some reason i felt like something didn't go the way he wanted. but i just blew it off... then i had to leave and we both knew it would be a while b/4 we saw each other again. and he kept saying how much he was going to miss me and all the good sappy stuff that us girls love to hear... but i really thought he meant it and i still kinda do.. Well then i talk to him on the phone and i ask him what's been going on and he tells me he's been thinking a lot about us... and i asked him what about us was he thinking so much about, and he told me that he doesn't want to get into a serious relationship right now.... ok i kinda felt that way too... or so i thought. Well then i started thinking about all the stuff that he went through to tell me how he felt and how i was so thankful when i took care of him when he was sick and all the things he said to me... and he broke up with his girlfriend (supposedly) for me?? ugh.. but then he all of a sudden decides he doesn't want a relationship... i'm thinking he's back with his g/f or they just decided something or i don't even know what to think.. I just don't get it.  Why would he do this to me... I just should have listened to Pepper and not got involved.  but i don't know what to do now.. if mike doesn't want to be with me at all then i'm not gonna be able to go over there for a while.. i can't be around a guy that just hurts me like this.  I had a feeling that things weren't going to go very far but my gosh.. i didn't expect them to end b/4 it really got started.  i'll know more when i talk to him but as of right now who knows what's going to happen.  well i'm out. talk to you later.."

So what am i suppose to do??? not find out and not see him for four weeks.. NOT SO MUCH.  And now he just looks at me like what am i suppose to say... TELL ME HOW U FEEL DAMN IT>>> I guess you have to spell it out for guys... so read and weep... or something like that.  I see that he wants to tell me something but for an unknown reason he isn't spiling his feelings.  what am i suppose to do with this kid??  who knows. i sure as hell don't know and if i don't who does.  well he does but he's opted to remain silent.  lol. he's reading over my shoulder whichis kinda the point you bastard... stop pinching me....ouch.. ok that really really hurt.  Well i guess that's how he feels... pinch me and it's all good.

I will have to do some serious studying in order to fix this mess i've gotten into.  I know it's my fault and there are no excuses or reasons that i should have failed.  all my classes were review which is why i stopped going.... i figured i already know all this info, why sit through it again.  Well once you start to skip..it's really really hard to get yourself back in the habit of going to class.  I know that's no reason to stop going and then to end up failing ur classes but that's honestly what happened.  once i decided that i didn't NEED to go i didn't.  However, i did actually need to go maybe not always listen but attendence was key.  ok so i screwed up my first semester at college.  I'm not done yet... i'm not going home or chickeing out on college.  I'm going to fix this if it means i don't see anyone at all ever... and all i do is study and do work and stuff like that.  I have to bring up my gpa and i have to get my act together or i'll never get into vet school.  yes i know you would think that someone who wants such an overwhelming career would not screw around her first semester of college but no.. not me. i have to screw it up b/4 i can fix it.  thank goodness i can stay in school.  anyways.. on a lighter note.. things between mike and i are wonderful.. i know that a lot of stuff happened and it was really crappy and ugh...just bad.  but it's been sorted out as far as i'm concerned, even though i love giving him a hard time about his g/f... now ex.  Hopefully... LOL.  anyways. i'm really tired and i think soon i'm gonna start getting dressed and made up for class... then i'll go to b/fast around seven and eat and then make my way to class... yeah... NOT!!!  well i should get to that.  just thought i'd drop you a line.."

"event","Ok, so it's been a long time since i've written which is dumb because i'm stressing out about a lot of crap that's been going on.  In my last entry i was worried about jack and brad... well they are both gone.  brad has a g/f and jack left the country.  So the two men that meant the world to me and that i hoped would possibly be meant for me are no longer in the picture.  So now i'm at school and probably failing most of my classes, one b/c i stopped going b/c a couple were just tooo easy and i got bored so much i wanted to die...not literally but you know what i mean.  Well then i joined a sorority and my awesome big sis introduced me to her very best friend and his roommate.  WELL.... then a bunch of stuff happened and the next thing i know i'm falling for this guy and i don't even know how it happened, well i do but i wasn't trying to fall in love.. i was still caught up on 'brad' so i didn't think that i could really fall in love with someone when i still was and maybe still am in love with another.  However, this new guy... well i'll just use his name b/c everyone who reads this already knows what's going on... but this is for me so anyways,...  Mike is the new guy.  He soooo awesome and omg I have a blast with him and he's just so damn wonderful which kinda sux b/c of what has happened.  But i'll get to that in a minute.  So here i am over the past month or so and just soaking up every ounce of his time and all that good stuff.. loving the fact that someone wants to be with me and not even thinking about anything really.  Just diving in like i usually do, which by the way never tends to work out for me but i guess we'll just have to see.  Anywho, so now i have fallen for this amazing amazing amazing guy... did i mention he's amazing...  yeah that's how i honestly feel.  ok so he tells me he isn't looking to get into a committed relationship right now which..ok i understand i'm still trying to get over the love of my life in the process so i'm good with that..  well then he makes a comment about how he hasn't even mentioned me to his family and that he still can't tell them about me completely... So he left sat and i was just left there sitting on this comment thinking how can he not tell them about me if he feels the way he says he does?? yeah i didn't get it either so then i started thinking about what piece of the puzzle i was missing.  And believe me i was stumped for a while and it wasn't pretty... well then i went out and someone made a nice smart a$$ comment and i asked that person about it and i was further informed of MIKES G/F.......................................................  omg, WHAT???  i was like, how did i miss that.  all along i was worried about this girl he was messing with over the summer and didn't even think about the girl still at home... yeah shocked the shit out of me too..  so i get my phone and give him a nice call when i'm not making the best judgemental decisions and let him know what i knew and then i talked to him about it.  Ok can i just tell you that i've never been able to talk to a guy like i talk to mike.  if i'm confused or anything really, if i need further info or just like what's going on i don't understand this reaction or whatever i know i can go ask him... never have i felt that comfortable with any guy... especially one that i've known for less than i've been in college..  but back to mikes girlfriend.... of two f$%*!@^$# years.....so i ask him about this.  and he tells me and is very persuasive and i want to believe him sooooooo bad but i really don't know what to think.. i'm afraid that if he can cheat on his g/f of that long then how do i know he won't cheat on me... His response: I won't find anyone better than you..>>> I know, he's such a sweet heart... UNFORTUNATELY... i've heard that before..many times b/4.  but i don't know what to do or what to think... but i'll have to come back b/c i have to go to class... i'll be back in an hour or so to continue my mixed confusion.."

"event","Ok so i think the last time i wrote... i gave two guys that i'm debating over.. well.........jack knows who he is and has confessed his love for me... Yah... to bad i'll never see him.... And then there is Brad... who i honestly think is completely oblivious to anything and everything around him related to girls... UGH!!!  So this is my plan... well it's just a thought for now but hopefully evolves into a plan so that it can be exicuted...i don't think that is how that is suppose to be spelled... o well.  Ok back to my thought....  Brad needs to know how i feel, yes..he does, i know this, but how do i tell brad that i've liked him as long as i have even though i know he likes someone else.  Should i still tell him? Or should i just leave it alone.  But then of course there is the chance that Brad and his crush last and become more than a crush and if they do what do i do... I mean i'm happy for him b/c he deserves someone as great as she is but i'm great too.  And she's got a great guy too... obviously i wouldn't care so much if he wasn't worth it to me.  However, if these two come together and are a huge success where will that leave me.. the jealous friend who watches as the person she loves falls more in love with another girl..  Or do i tell him how i feel now.. even tho i know he doesn't like me or at least he doesn't right now and that he does like another girl even tho he doesn't know that i know that he likes her.This is such a mess....   Ok so here's what i've got so far...   I like him, He likes her, she likes him back.  As far as anyone knows he doesn't like me... should i tell him how i feel or hold it inside for who knows how long and ten years down the road he finds out and says ""why didn't you tell me""?   I don't think i could go on with this and him never know and me always saying... what if i told him.... would it be different..  blah blah blah.  Ok so i've decided to tell him... but now this is the super tricky part... HOW?  do i write him, what do i say, do i tell him everything??? I don't know.  I already wrote him a letter ( 3 pages ) and it has everything in it, about when i started to like him, why, what made me realize how i felt ... yeah..everything.  But i think that is too much to throw at him all at once.  Ok so i need to re write my thoughts... give it to him soon... And then pray for the best.  I don't know why but I just feel like i'm not suppose to give up on how i feel for him.  there are all these signs that have been pointing me towards him and they are everywhere.  My thoughts on it were as follows:  If God has a plan for Brad and I then it will happen... maybe not exactly how it's suppose to but maybe this girl that Brad likes ( who isn't just any girl.. I love her to death) and me finding out about it is suppose to help me tell him how i feel.  I don't know.. I'm pulling at straws here... Anyways, how is God going to bring us together if he's thinking i don't like him and me thinking should i tell him??  Does that make sense??  Yeah?  Good!  Makes sense to me too.  Ok so i'm really tired and i have to go to the bathroom... I'll update to let you know what i actually do.  Bai"

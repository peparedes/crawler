"event","about a year ago... at the end of last summer, I went for a walk, and didn't plan on coming back. since then, I have felt happy and not all that depressed... but for some reason, now I always think about that walk, and what really happened that night... and why I came back. do not worry, I am not suicidal... its just that I wonder.. and I think about things that most people would not... and I am dwelling on them, it does not seem healthy... but I cannot stop doing it... I dont even enjoy talking to people anymore... I just like to be alone... I have noticed something, I love to be in a group, but I hate to talk... I will be with someone... but I just enjoy the silence... I dont like to talk anymore, I dont like to tell people about myself. I wish I knew why... but yea... so thats my update...

Last night my friend Mike saw that i was telling Kate i love her, and of course, the first thing out of his mouth was, ""I don't think its love"", and I said ""well then what is it?"", and he said ""it's probably lust dude..."", LUST?! i think hes finally lost it, but it scares me, that maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, but its not like I didnt enjoy being single, when I met Kate i wasn't looking for a girlfriend, but I went out with her cause whenever I was around her i had a strange feeling like never before, I have felt lust...this is not lust... but if it is, and my mind is making me think its love, then what if I hurt her? I couldnt live with that on my conscious.... I am so confused as to what to do, I am definitely not breaking up with Kate, guess I am just gonna have to talk it out with her...well I hope everyone has fun working or sitting around, or whatever they are doing, and have a nice day. cya all!!

"event","just got off the phone with Kate, she sounds like shes having fun.  I'm jealous, I just get to sit here and do nothing, this is so lame... but it makes me happy knowing she is enjoying herself. I wish I could hang out with her so much, but her parents don't know about us, and with their feelings about dating, it's better it stays that way...  but nothing can keep me from loving her, and thats all that matters, well, im gonna find something to do, cya all later!

"event","man, I don't knwo whats happening, I have never been this happy before.  I think Kate slipped something into my soda, lol. this is the best thing that could of ever happened to me, and I can't keep it to myself!! I checked out our horoscopes, as you can tell, I posted them after all, that something that happened today was told in the horoscope!!  It's like we're supposed to be togethor. usually I am paranoid that a girl is gonna cheat on me or leave me, but not now, I feel that I can trust Kate absolutely. my music plays for a new reason, to enjoy my happiness instead of wish for it.  I love this, its soo awesome!!Cya all!

"event","Your mother could be on your mind today, Andrew. The energy of the day could be inspiring you to think more about your family. If you aren't close to your mother, maybe that is a relationship that needs some work. Think about what your mom needs right now, and see if you can build a bridge to a better friendship. It could be time to start from the present and move forward. (mine)

Relationships of all kinds are likely to be strengthened today by an increased level of understanding on your part, Kate. Your thinking is greatly enhanced today by feeling, so you'll be more apt than usual to identify with the needs and desires of those around you. As a result, acquaintances could become friends, and friendships could progress into bonds that could last for life. Romance also benefits because of intensified empathy. Enjoy! (my awesome girlfriend, Kate's)

this is awesome, its really accurate. I love this stuff."

"event","well, its been a long time, but I'm back, hopefully.  well alot has happened, and i have learned alot, I am no longer suicidal, and i have been in really good moods lately.  i have  anew girlfriend, and she is awesome, i love her so much.

ok, to start it out, my depression is gone, it has been for about two weeks now.  the therapist i was seeing, Al Santos, is awesome, hes really smart and helped me alot, alot of the time i felt really stupid, but he showed me i wasnt.  i have been really happy lately, i rarely get mad, frustrated yes, but mad no,lol.

then there is my girlfriend Kate, we are perfect for each other, she is the best. i love her alot, we started out looking and smiling at each other in math, summer school. then we started talking, she wishes we talked sooner, so do I!!! lol, anyways, we went out to se spiderman 2 yesterday and had alot of fun.  I really like being with her, even if she did elbow me 5 times in the car lol, on accident though.

wells thats all i can think of for now!!

I think its cause I wish no one would miss me when I was gone, but i don't know why...blah...pssshhhh.  danielle is gonna dye her hair, probably shoulda let her say that, but I don't have any idea why...her hair was fine the way it was before.  but what place am I in to judge her... I'm the suicidal one, and as my step dad tells me, also the idiot of the family.  and he went to college so he MUST be right.  all hail Tom! yea fucking right... whats wrong with me... I am not sure if what I am writing is all my true feelings, but it is whats going through my head right now, and before you get mad at me and think I am being stupid, talk to me."

anyways, I have had a strange week.  the story I wrote is two days this week, and I thought it was the best way to tell you all what happened.  but yes, I WAS GOING TO KILL MYSELF, and was on the verge of acting it out. oh yea, I wanna thank Mrs. Abernathy for bringing my backpack to the coucelors office!! *sigh* I have so much more, but i am to depressed to type right now."

"event","he walks through the school, he walked to school with her that morning, but they barely talked, and he wished that he could have said more, he wished, but knew he di not have any more courage left.  he walked to his class, passing a girl that was in one of his classes, and he looked at her, she was very pretty, he was sure she would never think about suicide, but then he got to thinking that she might, he wondered how much people thought about suicide in this school, even if it was just once, it could almost be the whole school.  he walked into his class, his teacher, much shorter than him looked at him a wide grin on her face said ""hello! how are you?"" he faked a weak smile and said ""alright"" she gave him a worried look but as the bell rang she walked to the front of the class, and started to teach them, like she always had, and all he could do to keep his mind off of things was to listen to her, but then came a moment when he was glad he did, she started talking about her personel life,and he looked and listened in curiosity, she said that she wanted to go to law school, which he was also very interested in. when she finished they presented a project they worked on and finished the day before, he went up with his group and told the class what their project meant, saying as he had the loudest and deapest voice in the group.  he went back to his seat, and as the class started to get up and work on their projects he sat there, not really wanting to move, he had most of the project done anyways, and it was all at home, so why work on it here? but as he stood up finnally the teacher called his name, he looked past everyone and saw a lady next to his teacher smiling at him, he walked to her and she asked him to go with him, as he walked out of the classroom, he knew what it was for, ""are you a councelor?"" he asked and she replied ""yes"" he looked down and walked ot the counciling office, he said ""I know what this is for, but I talked to someone about it last night, a girl i know"" and she said ""can I ask the name?"" he told her the name and asked ""shes the one who told you about me, huh?"" ""yep, shes in my office"" he was both confused and a bit frustrated, as they walked into her office he looked down to see her in a chair, she looked at him and smiled fakely, her eyes showing she had been crying.  he smiled a bit back and walked to the chair next to her and sat down. the lady then sat at her desk and looked at them for a moment, as she explained why he was there he would glance at her every so often, but it looked like she was ignoring him, he was afriad he had made her mad, and he looked down ashamed.  she asked after a bit if she shou7ld leave them alone, and he said "" that'd be cool"" and she stood up and walked out. after the door shut he stood up and touched her arm, she stood up and hugged him immediately, all he could think of saying was ""I'm sorry"", and she kept asking why, and all he could answer her with was ""cause this is my fault"". they sat back down and the lady finally walked back in, they talked for awhile, but when they got to her problems he listened, and he just felt worse, he was causing her all this pain, and he knew it, and he knew he was screwing up her life, and it hurt him even more, he did not know what to do but sit there staring at the floor, glancing at he revery so often, but she would still not look at him. he sat there, wishing he knew what to do.

I still don't know what to do...

"event","sometimes I wonder, why do people claim how I feel?  They say how or who I love, when they have no idea, they say I do not love them, when they do not know, because they never cared to truly listen to me.  they never heard my voice quiver when I held them in my arms and told them how much I cared for them.  they never knew why I sat there in silence and whne they asked whats wrong I just said I don't know, because I knew that they hated fighting, and if i said what it was then they would get mad and it would lead to a fight.  but it was true that there was love for another, but it was only the love for a friend that understood everything about you, and you her.  nothing more, but after the relationship had ended, and there was no more hope, I realized that the one that understood me the most, and I her, was the best match I could think of, and the love progressed by itself, lonely, without another loving it back, but whne that love finally had enough courage to show itself, it was too late, and the pain now is almost unbearable, but the love for the friend is still more powerful, it wants the best for her, even though it looks at her through my eyes and wants to be closer to her, and it crys, even if on the surface it doesn't show, when she cries.  it feels so bad, and does not know how to make up for it.

never again, it does not want to get hurt, and it searched for a way to relieve the pain, but she does not allow it, and it loves her even more for it, she strengthens it, while others weaken it by things it never meant to make them think, but they do, and they wish that they would stop."

"event","he walked out of the house a sullen look on his face, he headed straight, not caring where he went, only one person on his mind, her, the one he wanted to talk to the most, he had just gotten in a fight, just about a walk he wanted to take.  but this walk was different, he had more motives to be out there, as he walked by her house he stopped and sat at the sidewalk, waiting to see if fate would have her look out the winodw and see him, and she might even walk out and with a beuatiful smile on her face say ""Hello"", but he waited there 10 minutes, and never did she look out.  so he walked down the block, walking by the huge houses he loved to look at, he wondered why, why his family is in poverty, why do these people live in such big houses? while he is in a small house, with three room instead of four or five, it must have been fate, but why him? he felt that if a car passed by maybe he would get in front of it, and see if it couldn't stop in time.  He stopped and turned to look back down the street at her house, he realized that if fate won't work with him then he would force it.  he made his way slowly to her house, seeing her dad's car in the driveway he feared that her father would tell him to leave, he walked to the door and opened the screen door slowly, the screech loud, he could hear voices inside, he tensed up and knocked on the door, he heard the voices acknowledge that he was at the door as she walked to the door he turned and looked to the sky, she opened the door and he asked quiet and serious, if she wanted to go on a walk, she leaned back to peer into the living room and asked her parents, they said yes, but only for 15 minutes.  they walked away from the house, she kept asking ""whats wrong?"" and he kept giving answers that were only half true, when really all he wanted to do was turn and kiss her, to show how much he loved her, but he knew he couldn't, he would never be able to talk to her again if he did.  so he kept walking, he told her of his grades, and of the fight over the walk, ande then of the cars, they walked around the block, he looked at her after telling her everything and saw her wiping away the tear.  he looked at her and felt like crying himself, he felt pain go through him, he did not want her to cry, especially for him.  but that changed the night for him, as they reached the corner they stopped, he told her not to worry, he promised her something that he would not break, he said "" you should go home now"" and she said ""where are you going?"" he looked behind her and said ""that way"" and she looked at him and hugged him tightlyhe hugged her back, wishing that they would never have to let go of each other, but she loosened her grip and so did her, he kissed her forehead and said ""I love you"" and she nodded and started to walk off and he stood there, staring at the ground, and he then he said "" I'm serious"" he turned to see she was looking at him "" I love you"" she murmured something he wished he would hear, but knew she did not mean it the way he did. he then walked off, not looking back, it was almost impossible for him to hold back the tears. he walked to the empty park behind the houses, and walked down to the play structure, he slowly climbed it, dogs in the houses surrounded him bark at him, breaking the peace, he climbs the structure the park is dead and abandoned, almost how he feels, the wood weak, he feels it creak under his feet, he stands there, knowing getting in front of a car is impossible now, after seeing her react that way, he would have never imagined that she would.  he jumps off the structure and heads to another nieghborhood, this one bigger than the last one he had been in.  he walked through it, wondering how these people got it all, wondering if he could pull it off, wishing, he walked to the main street outside of the neighborhood, standing and waiting to see if anyone would notice him to wave him accross the street, someone finally did after three cars that just flew by.  as he slowly walked accross the street he heard a yeell from behind him, one of the cars that had to wait for him for 30 seconds, he yelled ""you're too fucking slow!"", he kept walking and just kept looking at the man, as the man drove he kept staring back, he finally yelled ""don't fucking staring at me!"" as he drove out of sight he looked back in front of him, he took a left to a street he had driven through with his parents many times, each of them wishing they could afford to live in a place like that. he knew he would get lost, but he did not mind, his hands and face were very cold by now. he walks in almost complete silence, the noise of the gravel under his feet, and the wind blowing over his face and into his ears, the noise filling his head with noise.  when the wind died down he felt lonely, and afraid almost, but it would soon start back up and he felt like he had someone there with him, wishing it was her, but he knew he would never be that lucky.  he walked for about 20 minutes, wondering if he would have to turn back, he finally made his way to a street that connected to the street he crossed to get into this neighborhood, but as he walked something caught his attention, a man sitting in his living room reading a book, all alone, he did not want to stop and stare so he kept walking, as he did he saw an open door, and inside it were old antiques, and he continues walking he wondered if he would ever have anything valuable to keep in his life, he also wondered if he would have anyone to keep it with.  he walked abck to the busy street and waited again, this time onyl one car sped by, as he walked accross the street he made his way back home, he could not feel his hands anymore, and barely his face.  as he walked into his yard he was not sure if he wanted to walk through the door, but knew he had a duty as a son to return, as he walked in the door they said, ""wanna talk about it know?"" and all he could say in the same tone of voice he talked to her in he said ""maybe later"", he walked straight to his room, walked inside and sat at his computer.

I still can't feel my hands

"event","well my day has officially SUCKED, first, this morning Danielle did not show up, but I did not see her at school so I figured she was sick, so I have no reson to be mad at her.  but after school today, on my way to my grandma's, where I hate to go to.  I asked if I could go to Frank's, first you should know this, cause of my progress report I was limited time on my internet, so when I asked today my parents have apparently grounded me from friends houses too, even after I have caught up and is keeping up.  I hate them, I have not smiled, nor talked more than two words in the past three hours, it is so stupid, I feel like just going away and never coming back, I had a chance to do that to, I was going to move to my dad's, but my mom forced my dad to agree with her and not allow me to go.  I hate her mostly, I know hate is a harsh word, but she is killing me, and no matter how much I try to get away she won't let me, I wanted to take a WALK, and she told me no, she was afraid I would get in trouble or run away... I feel so trusted...not, she won't even let me do the dishes out of fear I will break a plate or glass.  I know there are parents out there much worse and that kids my age have to deal with them, but I'm not as strong as them I guess, *sigh* I wanna get out of here!!   help me....

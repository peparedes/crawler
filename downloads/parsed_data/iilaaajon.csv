"event","<P>well its Monday afternoon. I jus got home from school.. only had to go for a 1/2 hour today.. i slept aalright last night.. i had a really bad dream tho. I was in my car and i went to the gas station.. and jon was sleeping in the car.. but&nbsp;i forgot to put the car in park so when i got out it started rolling away and went into oncoming traffic and jon was killed. i looked it up on the dream website to see what it means...</P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#ffff99>""To dream about the death of your ex-boyfriend, suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this person special or what do you like about him. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, it indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life.""</FONT></EM></P>
<P>soo ya i guess thats what that means. i have soo manny damn things going through my head and now im sick.. really sick.. i have <FONT color=#33ff33>102 </FONT>fever this morning when i woke up.. i didnt eat anything all day yesterday and havent today except a banana and didnt even eat all of it. Im weak.. i keep crying and im jus completely misserable! i know this is for the best.. i know it is.. but its jus so hard to except.. Sarah told me last night.. <FONT color=#ffcc33>to go by what my heart tells me.. not what my brain tells me.. because if you think about it..when does your brain hurt? never.. your heart is always the one that has you crying. </FONT>Im goin with what my heart is telling me. All those times i thought i would manage if he ever broke up with me.. well that was jus a freakin cop out because.. look at me.. i cant even except it.. this jus tells me that i really was in love with him.. and he meant the world to me.. </P>
<P>*everything happens for a reason* there must be a reason for this.. hopefully?</P>
<P>welll im gonna go.. watch some tv.. then ggo babysit.. i wish i was a kid again.. so then my heart wouldnt feel this hurt! so until later.. i love you.. i hope we can work things out.. xoxo</P>

"event","well i dont think this day or this weekend could have gotten any worse. i hate everything about me right now. I ruined our relationship that i loved. All because im an ""emotional rollercoaster"" i have problems yes i know. But you were the only one who really understood me.. you knew that i had my problems. but you dealt with them. Im sorry for all the nagging i did to you.. i never thought that it would destroy our relationship. if i could iwould take it all back and start over new.. but i cant. I know you deserve someone who accepts you for who you are.. someone who can make you happy and who isnt so ""stressful.. and i thought i was improving on the nagging and the stressfulness.. i thought that i was trying harder to make you happy.. because thats all i ever wanted was for you to be happy... and if your not happy in this relationship with me.. then i understand. you are my best friend.. my only friend practically.. your the reason i am who i am today. i thank you for putting up with me for as long as you did.. I jus want you to know that i love you and you mean more then the world to me.. no words can describe my feelings for you.. if ""we"" are meant to be then we will be & if its not then we'll kno that to. i love you hunnie baby! : )

ps. you better still be going with me to my prom.. because you already said you would : )..."

Jon didnt get me <EM>ONE</EM> thing. : (.. he never has.. ive never gotten one card... homemade or anything.. not one flower.. even if it was picked outa someones yard..

But thats a negative.. i even called him while he was at work and he totally cut me off to say ""I cant talk right now.. im working"" well whatever mannn... godd.. i hate relationships.

I made him a brownie and decorated it.. i made choc. covered strawberrries. i gave him 2 cards and a rose. I jus dont get it. i beginning to think that a women deserves better then that.. i mean i should deserve better then that. but i try to jus ignore it because i love him but really its hard when its a holiday. <FONT color=#ffff99>Am i over-reacting???</FONT> AND on top of all that... We keep fighting <FONT color=#99ffff>CONSTANTLY!</FONT> geeshhh</P>

school was alright today. it was boring and long like always.. and i was dead tired.. but i got through it. im mad at jon.. he doesnt kno it though.. he makes me so mad.. i havent 'talked' to him in 2 days.. like heard his voice.. WHY? o because HE HASNT CALLED! i hate when he does this shit.. and i deffinately am NOT calling him.. i feel like i always call him and he NEVER calls me.. sooo he better call me soon.. or i will not jus be pissed i will be ROYALLY PISSED... and then i jus wont talk to him.. i mean what is he possibly doin that he cant take 5 mins to call me and tell me he loves me or that hes FINE... UGHHHH! i hate guys.. especially when they pull shit like this. but whatever.. we'll see how long it takes him to call.

"event","""the reason it hurts so much to seperate is becus our souls are connected. maybe they always have been & will be maybe weve lived a thousand lives before this one & in each of them weve found each other & maybe each time weve been forced apart for the same reasons. that means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past 10 thousand years & a prelude to what will come. when i look at u i see ur beauty & grace & know they have grown stronger with every life u have lived & i know i have spent every life before this one searching for u. Not someone like u, but u, for ur soul & mine must always come together. & then for a reason neither of us understands weve been forced to say goodbye. I would love to tell u everything will work out for us & i promise to do all i can to make sure it does. But if we never meet again & this is truely goodbye, I know we will see each other again in another life. We will find each other again & maybe the stars will have changed & we will not only love each other in that time, but for all the times we've had before."" The Notebook

"event","ok welllll letss seee... yesterday was a very NOT SO good day! I got home from school and layed out for like 3 hours! GOT A GOOD TAN GOIN!!! then took a shower.. layed down for a little bit and then met DB.Jeff.Rachel.and.Kevin at Starbucks before Church! Church was VERY good last night.. i had so much funn.. well i met this guy Roger.. hes cool.. i guess.. a little weird.. got me into the singing and dancing.. so it was fun.. then after Church ended around 9:30.. Me.Dustyn.Jeff. and Roger.. all went back to Roger's house for like 30 mins.. then we decided to go to McDonalds to get something to eat.. well were eatin.. and we get up to throw our stuff away and in walks these 2 guys.. they were short and stocky looked like normal people.. so as were walkin out one of the guy comes out and asks Dustyn his name so he tells them and then the guy turns to me and asks me my name and his name and i told him.. and he was like are you lieing to me and im like noo... so then Roger says something under his breath.. and this ""guy"" pulls outa badge and like gets all up in Rogers face.. like are you mocking me? and Roger was like no sir i jus said something to my friend.. then all of a suddne they throw him against the glass and he was like get off of me.. and they start yelling at him and cursing and all this stuff.. so i start CRYING!.. and they put handcuffs on him and im freakin out.. i was soo scared. and they jus kept talkin all this crap.. tellin him he was goin to jail tonight.. i mean Rogers 16 years old.. give him a break.. and Dustyn jus stood there and i knew he wanted to do something but he couldnt.. i guess they were doin an investigation and Dustyn looked like the suspect.. i dunno.. Roger jus shoulda kept his mouth shit.. he jus kept talkin back to the cops.. i mean they looked like they were hurting him.. and it was jus the scariest scene there were like 3 cop cars... and it looked like we were havin a freakin drug bust.. it was jus UNBELEIVEABLE!! and right after church too.. i couldnt stop cryin.. i was there till like 11:00 so then Dustyn had to go back to Rogers and tell his parents what jus happened.. i still dont kno what happened after they left.. because i havent talked to DB.. UGH... i hate Naples cops.. they had NO right to act that way.. absolutely No right! it jus wasnt fair.. i didnt understand.. and i still dont. So i got home at like 11:45.. and went to sleep. it was a really crappy night mann... hopefully that doesnt ever happen again.. well ok jus wanted to get that out.. mann i have so much else to say.. but i jus cant say it.. o well..

Followed them to this girl Katies house ( WOW. that house mann.. its pretty weird.. deff never goin back there again! ) So when we got there we were there for only like 5 secs and then they all wanted to leave to head to the movies (HA) but it was jus because her house STANK and it was dark! soo we left.. got to the movies saw ""Friday Night Lights"" it was pretty good.. The boys really got into it. ((we saw about 10 GC kids there that play football and there talkin this and that... id watch out if i were you!)) then after the movies.. : )... we were supposed to go back to Katies but no one really wanted to and Stuy had to go to some girls house to get the putang.. soo i told Dustyn that we would meet up afterwards..so me, Rachel and Alex went back to Katies! it was freakin GAY! so i called Dustyn and told him NOT to meet us there to meet us at my house. so we came here.. played video games (football, I beat ALEX HA) and then we all got in my car and dropped Rach off at home. Then came back here. It was Dustyn, Stuart, Alex and me.. we jus played video games.. i made them all food.. and then Stuart passed out then Alex.. so then it was jus me and Dustyn.. we jus talked.. a good talk. Hes sucha good kid.. he jus seems so peaceful and happy. ((Hes into church and God)).. so then they left at 5:30am.. Stu spent the night and then we went fishing the next mornin.. me Alex, Stu, and Dustyn! and that was pretty it for Sat & Sun...

Tuesday.. went to school.. still sicker then a dog.. had Mid-Terms.. YUCK.. then went to the mall with Rach.. she bought her homecoming dress! its soo cute.. (i need to get me one.. thats if i even go) then came home.. layed around decided to go get juice from Publix then stopped by James reall quick.. had a good talk.. and then headed home to go to bed.

Wednesday.. school again.. but it acutally wasnt bad.. i only had one class and the rest of it we were in the auditorium.. jus the Seniors we talked about Scholarships.. Graduation.. class colors (red, black) and then went outside and took a class picture.. CUUTEE! then i left and now im jus sittin here.. waiting on tonight.. were all goin to Church!

Tomorrow.. we have school.. regular school.. and then we were ALL supposed to go to Il PRimo.. like all the Seniors.. ((that we hang out with )) and they invited me to go.. but now they jus want it to be ""the guys"" because i would prob be the only girl so they said for me to jus stya home and they'll bring me food afterwards.. HA.. since there comin back here.. to hang out : )!! YAY.. then Friday.. we have our BIG game against GULLLFFF COOOASSSTTT!... aka GULF TOAST!

Saturday, we woke up went to McDonalds.. then came back here listenin to a little of my brothers football game then went to my aunts for a cook-out. We had steak and all this good stuff. Then we went to the movies and saw ::The Forgotten:: it was good.. jus a little weird. then went to Sweet Treats and then i came home.. and of course Jon went back out.. and came back here at like freakin 3:30. Sunday, we didnt do much.. jus slept and he left.. and now well im here.

"event","my mom and me STILL keep arguing. Shes mad at me again.. and again.. its like i can NEVER do anything right.. and if i do.. she doesnt wanna take the time to notice it. I got straight A's on my report card today.. FIRST time EVER.. and ya kno what she did?? i handed it to her.. and she through it back at me and said she didnt care. ya kno how much that puts my self esteem so low? its like i try so hard to be this person that i dont have to be.. but i do it jus to make my parents pleased with me.. and to show them that ive changed.. but my mom doesnt wanna see it.. she doesnt care that im doin 100% better then i was back in the day. all she cares about is my older brother Colby or my younger brother and my sister. COlby this all time football player in her eyes that NEVER does anything wrong.. no matter what he does.. and she hates to hear differently. Jesse.. is this football player thats gettin AWESOME grades & never does anything wrong to her. and my sister.. ALWAYS gets straight A's.. gets everything from EVERYONE.. never messes up.. but then here i am. This little screw up.. that no matter how hard she trys or what she does she can never do anything good. or be congraduated about anything its like its against the rules or she doesnt believe me.. i never once have heard her say Im proud of you.. never to me.. but to everyone else tho. its like they dont think i can do it.. NONE of them do. I tell them im goin to college and they all jus laugh. why do they laugh? its not funny. they jus dont beleieve in me.. and that really hurts. its like i have to jus tell myself that im goin to go to a good college.. jus so i dont give up.. because i kno i would if i didnt wanna prove them wrong.. or get outa this town. and then they say OO you'll come back.. WHY?? jus because Ashley did you think Haley automatically will. NO im not Ashley.. im totally different from her.. i wont ever come back... but they dont believe me. I jus dont kno what i need to do with myself anymore.. NO ONE in the house is talkin to me except Jesse. there all being soo IMMATURE about it. my mom wont give me any money.. she wont talk to me.. she doesnt even cook me dinner anymore! so i sit and eat crackers at 11:30 at night. and im starving everyday because i cant eat anything without money but then when i go and ask my dad for money she gets all pissed again. SO i really dont kno what to do anymore. if you kno me.. the last thing i like to do is FIGHT.. i absolutely HATE it. because i get so emotional. god this really sucks.. i hate it here right now.. the past is comin back.. and i dont want it too. : ("

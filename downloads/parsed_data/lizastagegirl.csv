School....hmm, good question. Let's just say, I am in love with living here again. It's like you drive anywhere and there is beauty on every side of you. So, Boston is where I am staying, or, at least, the North.
Regarding school, though--not so much. People are nice and all, but I can't live as just a Theatre Major. I went to see Jesus Christ Superstar the other night, and realized all the more that a MTM is what I must be. When and where that will happen is still unsaid, but, by God's grace, it will happen. 
But I miss all of you so much.....I am going to call some of you soon. But I'm coming back Thanksgiving! For four measly days, but, oh what glorious days they will be!
OK, I must study....French test tomorrow, and then Theatre lab. 
Loves to my friends........that means all of you, of course.

So much has happened since I last wrote. Well, nothing really interesting, just....a lot. ""Joseph"" finished (to critical acclaim, of course) and then I picked up to helping my sister out with some of her wedding plans. Speaking of which, she is getting married in about two weeks! GEESH! So much for all the weight I had planned on losing before it happened! Ah well, I guess I will be immortalized in all the pictures as the ""voluptuous maid of honor"". 
Then, more scarily, I had my wisdom teeth out last week. It has been exactly seven days since the fateful pulling, and my mouth has only just begun to return to normality.
Other than that, I will be leaving for MA for the wedding in a week and returning the 26th. So, catch me while you can, you lucky ones. 
Love my friends.......love Jesus.

"event","Well, I'm starting to wonder if I am just a good shoulder to cry on as far as boys go. I mean, the majority of times boys have ever asked me out or gotten my number was pretty much a week after their own breakup. Like today, this friend of mine in NE (who I've been emailing) randomly gives me his number. I don't call him, but give him mine, thinking we are just friends and there's nothing behind it. Then when he calls me, only about a minute into the conversation, he tells me he's had to break up with his girlfriend. I, of course, can't judge him and say that that is the only reason why he called me. But the fact that he did call me, (also texting me several times calling me pet names), makes me kind of wonder. I will give him the benefit of the doubt, because he is a nice guy.
But still, is that an excuse? I think not. To run to the opposite sex for comfort after a breakup is a HUGE NO SIGN. Even if you do not realize it, you are inevitably wanting one of the representatives of that sex to show you affection. Believe me, I've been tempted too to call some of my guy friends when I have felt jilted or some such. 
I don't know, I just don't get it. For once I just want a guy to come to me with absolutely no baggage trailing behind him.
And once more, another writing from the desk of Elizabeth.....will it ever end?"

I'm not going to download on to everyone my stress. I just need to keep telling myself that there's not point to be stressed. It only hurts.
I mainly just wanted to let someone know (anyone) who might be stressed too to not do it to yourself. And to let you know you're not alone. Probably the most comforting thing to ever hear is to know that you are not alone.
Like today. I spent pretty much the whole day at our condo by myself. So I sat there watching some ""Project Runway"" on TV and random other stuff, and all I felt was miserable. All I did was wallow in my stress and unhappiness. It didn't help. All I ended up doing was leaving earlier than I thought to be with (believe it or not) my parents. Yes, I know. Ridiculous. But the fact was, I needed people. Like Barbra sang, ""people, people who need....people.""
Cliche? Yes. But, nothing like the old truths that have always served us well.
Good news. I'm randomly going to Disney this weekend and seeing Joseph!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, it's true, once you decide to make theater your life, you can't help but go crazy. I think of the things I've done, small or large, and have to just smile because not many people ever do those things. Such as parading the streets in public dressed up in some of the most ridiculous costumes you've ever seen, during my breaks of a show. Or performing a song that I only just heard five minutes ago with my best friend (yes, Maria, that's you). These may sound like normal to all of you, since you are all theater people, but think about it things you've done. Normal people would never do what we do. They'd rather die first.
Like my sister always says to me about every show I've done:
"" I don't know how you get up and do that....I couldn't.""
And she, having her second child. THAT takes guts.

Five hours later....we had the Azalea Trace nursing home as our guest today, so they provided food for us after the show.

"event","Alright, so the other day I'm driving in my car to the mall, and I pull up to the light. The car next to me honks and I look over, only to find three obese teenage boys waving hysterically at me. I coldly look away. 
Not ten minutes later I am walking into the mall when the roofers (who were probably at least 45) look down at me, and call out ""Hey lady!"" along with woot calls and whistles. 
Considering that I had on no makeup and was having one of my ""fat"" days, is it true that men are pigs? Can we girls not go out by ourselves in the middle of the day in open public without the fear of some slob treating us as if we were something to be looked at and lusted after? Is there no respect?
I'm out........if someone would like to answer my questions, please do."

"event","Watched Bambi tonight. Some say it's boring, but I love that movie...just because it's Bambi. And Thumper is my favorite.

Thumper's Mom: ""What did your father tell you this morning?""
Thumper: (clears throat) ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin' at all."""

"event","Ok, so tonight at King and I we had our first Actor's Therapy Group. I'm serious people, we actually sat in this semicircle around Rodney like we were about to do yoga or something. And then he goes on to ask us all (who had just been there for three hours straight) where the rest of the cast was? I loved Joanna's reply:
 ""Well, we're here.""
 Exactly. It's like, we've all ready been here for our entire evening and you're going to just take up more of our time by asking us where everyone else is? I'm sorry, I really hate seeing Rodney upset, but, golly, get used to it as a director. Though I really am not as mad as I sound, more amused over what everyone said at this therapy group. Like when one of the leads said how we smaller parts people shouldn't worry because ""one day we'll all get a chance to be a lead too"", I just about guffawed with laughter. And then the old speech preach about the someone who ""plays the part of a tree is just as important as someone who is singing right next to the tree"". I've heard it peeps. Don't try to sell me on it. I'm past being sold.
So, I'll shut up now, only hoping that the few King and I people on LJ aren't offended or something. I really love you all, I just think it is much too funny for me to take.
So, until we meet again at the next session, goodnight.

What are they feeding you?
Smelly cat, smelly cat,
It's not your fault

They won't take you to the vet
You're obviously not their favorite pet

"event","Ugh....you should see me at King and I rehearsals guys. I am way too hyper!
I think--no, I know it's because I haven't anything to do. I just sit there for the whole show, aching to sing and perform. It's just so exasperating. Thank God I have all my other wives to chill with. (Boy, I never thought I'd ever write that sentence before.)
Light in the Piazza in my head.......wonderful thing to get stuck in your head.

loves........goodnight, sweet prince."

"event","I got my ACT test scores today. 
Composite score was a 24. Not as good as I hoped, but I'm going to take it again, and try for a better one. 
But why, why, why do I study my brains out, and end up with such average scores? I feel so stupido.

Hallelujah anyhow."

"event","What a sack of potatoes I was today. After my classes, I just came home, did homework, cleaned my room, and proceeded to do nothing for the entire day. 
But my Mom said something interesting to me today. I was driving her somewhere, and she told me that she saw me as ""older"" now that I had my license. Isn't that funny? But it was rather nice, too, to be told by your parent that they are beginning to realize you are growing up."

"event","Well last night was a success as usually . Everyone I think had a really good time. Danny Red Tore shit up.. And To start off the night that strange DJ Pandybear made an appearance , maybe his set list will be posted lol. Shok showed up had the People moving, and Wendy was great as usual. 
 Tonight I will be at Shock Therapy Probably a first for anyone to see me there. But what the hell they papered our Joint fair is Fair. Danny Red is Spinning So I am looking fwd to that. Angelika may be there, Lesley will be there, and Rad just may come . If he does that would kick ass. But if any of you people who read my rantings are doing nothing roll on out and Say hi. I will pretty much be out of my element I am not much of a Fetish person. But should be fun none the less. 
Thank you to all who came out last night , I cant go into lists , too many to mention but you know who you are. And Rad and I really appreciate your support."

One of my personal Favs of the homeland. Then Rolled out To meet up with Jen at Mark and Dinks party. Finally got there around 8 stayed till one. I was completely focussed on Jen with the few Jello wrestling interruptions that we both were just dying over.  But pretty much Jen and I just talked I Introduced her to as many people as I could. I think she enjoyed that. But She definitly made my night. Cant wait to see her again..  Anyway So i worked again today and of course because i only slept for like 3 hours maybe less.. ..

"event","OK , Thank you Ev eryone for coming out and making it another great night. Special Thanx to r0mp for supplying decks to use upstairs. And keeping his clothes on for a change lol. And definitly thank you to our Guest DJ .. Greg aka DJ Blackoil. For spinning some kick ass sets, with special props for doing it ""deaf"" for a little while. 
So anyway the Night started with Rad and I driving down to the club , jamming out some Dioxyde and God Module. With Spurted mini discussion on the way. Dropped me off at the club to goto Wendys house and I needed to set up . Everything finally got Rolling and the night moved fairly smoothly , although I extend my apologize to Jeff <finite> for the things that I know he is aware of.  
But all in all it was a good night. Coral I believe behaved herself for the first time in a long time :) but i also didn't buy her  a drink lol. Ok I am off this thing before i start rambling into other events of the night that i am still processing , like a conversation with Rad on the way home. I definitly like the way he thinks , I think he feeds off of how i think too, Good Cop Bad Cop kinda thing most definitly lol."

First of all the door guy told me I wasn't Listed again, and I was like fuck that I see my name right there. He was like OH umm I'm sorry . Yeah right , little twit. then I put fliers everywhere which took all of 15 min. I saw Michael <rooster> Finite <Jeff> Frank, LIyssa, Plastique , David, and please excuse me if I left anyone out I was talking to a lot of people. I met Jon gill , who was standing right next to me when I was talking to frank about not being on his list. And he taps and was like who are you. Once we cleared up the issue of who I was he was way kewl. I will go check out some of his HOUSE work tonight at the club next door, and he will be stopping in at La Tazza to check out our night. But on with the misery that is Shampoo I was upstairs and 1 theres a mosh pit going, they playing NIN, White Zombie etc etc . now don't get me wrong I do like that music to but not at a club.

"event","OK So last Night went Extremely well I thought, It was hell trying to get down there, I was running around trying to get everything together that I had to do. Then I took off for South Philly to Pick up Coral, then made our way to the club. Coral was thinking she would get Issues with the doorman again , but when we walked in he was busy doing something Else so we just rolled thru the door. Note to Self, this is a bad thing, anyone could have come in the same way. We Only had the Upstairs Till Midnight, some punk band playing downstairs, But its Philly and its a Late crowd Anyway, So things worked out. People were having a really good time, I was actually talking to new people and old faces all night . Took a damn shitload of pictures. Had a really great time. Helped tear down the lights for the night, and took Coral home. Special thanx goes out to Cherie and Friends for coming all the way down to be apart of our night. And to Meghan who although really didn't like the place Did come out last night . We really appreciate the support"

"event","Your Brain Usage Profile

Auditory : 52%
Visual : 47%
Left : 40%
Right : 60%

 Andy, you are moderately right-hemisphere dominant and have even preferences between auditory and visual processing, traits that might make people perceive you as ""slightly off balance.""

You are most likely to be slightly disorganized, a ""dreamer"" and a person who focuses more on the end result than the immediate task at hand. You are creative and spontaneous if somewhat lacking in direction and focus. You are a learner who is generally patient and a person for whom time is an ally, not an enemy.

You are more passionate than most people with regard to life and learning and recognize your own intuitive abilities. You have sufficient goal-direction to satisfy yourself and guarantee success without being or feeling driven. You are willing to be reflective about yourself and others without getting lost in rumination.

The balance of your sensory modes allows for both learning and expressive capabilities achieved by few. You are active and ""seeing"" while retaining an equally strong propensity for being reflective which slows you down a little but allows for a more comprehensive perception and analysis of situations and problems. You do not spend excessive time analyzing since you mostly trust your perceptions.

In all likelihood, you have a tendency to overcommit and cannot under- stand why others get upset since you operate on a different ""time table"" than they do. Your organizational abilities are frequently overwhelmed by the stimulation seeking and active nature of your mind as well as by the tendency to create new categories and gloss over details, making categorization and classification almost impossible at times.

To the extent that your career path allows for creativity and abstraction as well as a bit of disorganization, you should find yourself equipped to handle any learning that is required. Your own personal adjustment to your style should come naturally although you are likely to feel frus- trated by your own limited discipline and often wonder ""Why?"""

"event","Well I attended Vesago Last night. Dj Schmitty and myself papered the hell out of that place, and I worked my ass off talking to people and giving them fliers. I hope it wasn't all for not and we get a good crowd out. I am also working a couple side ideas right now to try and bring some industrial back to Jersey. And thank god I have Rad to confer with or I would still be completely lost with a lot of it. He is a HUGE help. And thanx to Clint who also gave me some pointers and ideas to run with. Anyway back to last night, I went to Delaware to pick up Laura and brought her with me to Vesago. She got pretty trashed but still had a decent time, then she convinced me to go to south st and pick up Pizza, which I have to say she was right it was kick ass. Then when we got back to her house I was so beat she was nice enough to let me crash there.  I put her to bed :) and no nothing perverted I just wouldn't let her sleep on the floor where she started to crash at in the first place. then in the morning I made my way home. With a shit load of ideas running thru my head.  My brain never stops , and once I put a focus to it, its just crazy. but I will see where some of this goes, all you jersey people cross your fingers I am trying hard to bring the scene back in Jersey. You guys just have to come out and support the scene and I know you will."

"event","Well Its the last night for Sin Thursday at Conduit. Once again please come out and support this final night at this venue. AS I am sure many have seen Rad has announced there will be no cover charge. This is in thanx to all who supported the night . There Will be of course photos of the final night posted to Sinthursday.com as well as the new video idea. Myself and a friend will be taping the evening though out the night. It is my great hope that this is not  a final goodbye to all those I have met there, I have hopes that a new venue is secured and the night will go on, the people who supported Sin Thursday at Conduit will also come out and show support for whatever Venue becomes the new home for the night. Who knows change isnt always bad, sometimes it takes a downfall to build something greater."

"event","Ok So last night was a blast as usually for all you slackers that don't come out to Sin Thursday you don't know what your Missing. Anyway So the Night started Off going to get Judy from Philly. And then returning to Conduit. I have to say she is a very kewl girl. And not too bad on the eyes :P. But She was soo tired she didn't last long and I ended up taking her home at 1030. I have to give her thanx though for coming out even though she was beat. No biggie for me to drive to her. Anyway When I got back from Dropping her back off at home. The night was in full swing, people were having a great time.. And RAD running around in his SARS mask was just hilarious. But it worked for him so whatever. Hung out with coral who was up to some crazy shit as usual some of which I didn't learn of till later. Lidz was pretty hammered but handling it very well I thought. Cherie Came out with Katie and Kit, I was so happy to see her. Stunning as usual :) The NYC crew Was missed but I appreciate the intentions of coming out.  Oh yeah and CORAL enough with the hung stories or I will just have to whip this out lol....  So I have one more day of work and then 30 days off.. WOOOO HOOOO who wants to occupy my time?? I get ink on Monday been a few years.. Anyway more to come later .. Peace out NIGGA"

<h2>Your Tongue's Talent is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/givinghead.html"">Giving Head</a>!</h2>
Your thick, wide tongue is the perfect size and shape for giving him pleasure. Not to mention, you know just how to work all the curves.
<br><br>
You'll do just about anything to make others happy, and when you're uncomfortable, you don't like to say so. 
<br><br>
So that probably means your mouth is starting to get worn out. Slow down, and learn how to speak your mind! 
<br><br>
You'd be most compatible with a Nipple Sucker. They're sure to give you the attention you so desperately need. 
<br><br>
You've been giving everything for so long that you forgot what's it's like to be pleasured. It's time for you to lay back and get licked.

<h2>You'll Fall in Love With A <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/capricornlover.html"">Capricorn</a>!</h2>
You enjoy power as much as a Capricorn...<br>
And you especially enjoy the power your Capricorn uses to win you over.<br>
For you, relationships are a struggle of who's dominant - and who's on top!<br>
<br>
Since your Capricorn is afraid of losing control, falling in love can be hard for him or her.<br>
It's difficult for Capricorns to trust and let go when they meet someone they care for.<br>
Give your Capricorn time, and he or she will become 100% devoted to you.<br>
<br>
Your Capricorn strives to be the best - both in and out of the bedroom.<br>
With the amount of money your Capricorn makes, almost any type of fun is within limits.<br>

Which means I am going out to meet all you wonderful people , get sloppy drunk and try to avoid being assaulted this time by insane females. Molested is one thing , assaulted is another. 
   So whats new oh I saw Matrix Reloaded yesterday at an Advanced Showing.. I really liked it I am sure people will have mixed feeling, but i dont wanna say anything about it you just have to see it for yourself. 
  But I believe If Anyone has seen The Matrix Already, If you bring your ticket stub to Sin Thursdays tonight you can get in at reduced rate."

But apparently sometime last night someone get into my car. They took the whole drivers manual packet I have which also held my registration and Insurance info. And a Valet key to my car which was in the glove box , oh and the glove box lock was ripped off. So now I have to get my locks re-keyed and deal with the insurance company etc etc etc. Blah I hate this fucking city, my car has been vandalized so many times and now this. Although I am still not sure why they didn't just take the car when they had the chance, probably didn't realize they had the right key.God my luck never changes I go from bad to worse just to go back to bad :("

"event","Wow I hardly Ever post to this thing anymore, I see why others fall behind too. So to catch up lets see.. Rad and I went to New Brunswick to have dinner with Jes at this Japanese restaurant. And got Cherie to come out too at least for a few. Was Nice to meet everyone.  Then We went out for coffee later that night didn't get home till  around 230 got up at 530 went to work.  Was dead tired till about 230 in the afternoon then I got a second wind, and started getting damned silly. Cracked up for about 15 min straight for no reason whatsoever. Came home did some cleanup , Downloaded a few albums from Rad and just chilled out. Went to work today had some interesting news I am now the supervisor of the Person I was trying to get removed from our section, great . I also found out I'm not on  the list for orders at least not that Anyone knows of so I get to stay in Jersey for a bit longer, not that I overly love the state itself, but I m finally after 7 years making new friends and doing stuff. Looking Fwd to Thursday already , I have to Work Swing Shift tomorrow , 3-11, to fill in for someone but I get Wednesday off so that's kewl. And I will be out Thursday Night, work Friday morning that's gonna hurt, but its worth it. Then Go back out Friday for the Ciber Event  luckily I am off Sat and Sunday to recoup.

"event","Alrighty Well Last Night I went to my friend Matt's house , we were planning on getting really wrecked , but that didn't happen when I got there I didn't even feel like drinking, As a matter of fact the first time I ate in over 24 hours was this morning on the Way to work.  But anyway we just chilled out watch a movie or 2 played some PS2, and wooped up on each other with a little Aikido WHOO AAAAA. Just a guys chill night lol.. Came home went to bed, had crazy ass dreams, woke up all sweaty like I just worked out something fierce. So today is Tuesday And I imagine a lot of you out there are going to Shampoo's for the assemblage show. Have fun I Don't think I will make It Even though Rad has Highly suggested to view it.

"event","Well SIN THURSDAY was a total hit yet again, We Got over 200+ so to all who showed up I say thank you. I have been pushin the club pretty hard and I am hoping I had a little something to do with it. But it was an outstanding time, And believe it or not I was fairly Social for a change. I actually took some pictures too. And then there was this whole incident with some undesirables being there, but Rad being the nice guy he is left them off with just a warning. I hung out with Jess and KT they are both so adorable and much fun, cept when KT gets ahold of the camera. Jess was having a horrible day I hope I made it a little better making her laugh. Met Tina and was told I look MUCH better then my pictures.. I'm still pretty ugly though but she didn't say that, lol. Its Just something I know was being thought. But all in all it was a great night."

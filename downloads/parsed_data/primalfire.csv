<lj-cut text=""Personal observations of the body-mind & its needs, and how that relates to the energetic field."">

<li> Food is king. What a person puts into their body determines their emotional and mental clarity, energetic levels, and overall state of being.

<li> When it comes to food, no '-ism' works for all people. Vegetarianism, veganism, raw foodism, macrobiotics(ism), atkins .. whatever. No belief of what a person eats is important. 

What I believe I should eat is different than what my body needs ...

I use two things to determine if what I am eating is appropriate for my body. How I feel after I eat, and if my body eliminates the meal the next day. If I feel good (or not ill), it is fine, and foods that cannot be passed in one day I tend to avoid (hence, no red meat, cheese, processed foods, etc.)

<li> Elimination is very important. Once a day is, for my body, optimal. Less than that and my mood, energy levels and clarity suffers. More than that means that I am just catching up.

<li> Drinking water satisfies most hunger urges. The 'hunger' feeling in the body is a need that may not be hunger. Water works wonders.

<li> Sleeping 6 - 8 hours a day. Less than that on a consistent basis, and I begin to hallucinate, more than 8 hours a day consistently makes me groggy. I can sleep 4 hours a night, and get a 2 hour nap in the afternoon and that feels great, I have great clarity.

<li> Exercise .. sucks. Never exercise! Instead, find ways to enjoyable engage the physical body in activity. Dancing, running, martial arts, tai chi ... what I find is most important is that the activity engages the 'heat' in the body. It doesn't matter how far you run, or how many calories are burned, or how much iron is pumped, simply that the body gets warm all over.

<li> Simple discipline is important. Find one thing that can be done daily, and only choose something you love. Stick with it because it becomes transformative. Make it simple and easy. For example, breathing meditation before bed, stretching just after getting out of bed, chewing your food well at each meal, etc.

<li> Speaking of chewing food ... eating slowly means respecting the body, preventing over-eating, and most importantly - really tasting the food!! Fruits become so incredible when allowed to melt in the mouth.

<li> Energy body, this is the heat within the body, both physical and 'spiritual.' It is most easily felt when the body is clean and the mind is not distracted. It is always present, becoming conscious of its movements requires keen observation.

<li> The physical energy body is fueled by food, powers the mind, and is used to power the body and the mind. A conscious connection with this energetic flow within the body allows a person to know what is truly appropriate for eating, for doing, and for not-doing. This sense builds over the course of time with self-observation.

<li> Respecting and honoring the energy body allows the physical and mental body to easily come into an aligned state. Though the process may be rocky, misalignments are gradually removed, leaving only the natural state. By focusing on this one area, and not listening to the mind's labels about the energy body and its messages, transformation occurs.

<li> Fresh air and nature are very important.

<li> Breathing deep, so important, it takes years to really know how to breath deeply. The musculature system holds so much tension in the chest and abdomen, groin and upper legs, and breathing deep stretches all of these contractions out. It is the singular most powerful way to unleash, unlock and unwind old patterns, yet the key is in _feeling_ the muscles impacted by breath and allowing them to stretch. As one pattern is discovered and moved through, deeper tensions become evident. This is why it takes years, no person could remain sane by addressing all the junk released from deep breath if it all came up in a short period of time.

<li> Taking it easy ... slowing down. Society has taught me to be very hectic and active. Nature is not like that. Finding the flux and flow of life, and moving with it as a dance, unfolds into profoundly powerful motions that are impossible to stop. This alone has been a huge aid in recognizing the freedom of the self, because it defies what the mind expects and demands.

<li> Being quiet ... take the time to be still every day, to not engage in all the doing. Learn to enjoy it.

<li> Nurture a living being; plants and animals have special properties that can heal the soul when appreciated.

<li> Self-massage does wonders to release tension. Neck rolls, simple spinal twists, using a tennis ball on the floor to relieve pressure points ... when done with slow, conscious engagement allows tensions to dissolve. When done just before bed, one sleeps better.

<li> Stay away from electronic devices, be sure to have consistent non-tech time. The electromagnetic fields from these devices can be harmful when over-exposed to them. 

<li> Dreams are two-fold; meaningful and meaningless. Most dreams are pointless, some dreams feel different. Most dreams are regurgitation of recent activity. The other dreams happen most frequently when a person is clear in body and mind, and can provide assistance when most needed.

Ok... that is it for now. I may add more to this as I think of things. There are so many little tricks and observations I've had over the years, some of them are seemingly insignificant yet have had provided powerful results for me."

When I look at an online community, I tend to see the same things over and over, whether on LJ, other boards, in Brietbart and Drudereport comments; it seems that ill-mannered, rude, poor communication and lack of knowledge is the rampant internet standard. Taking it off the internet, this break-down in communication seems to pervade the masses, dictate political debate and policy, and is the status-quo in the media.

I've been contemplating the larger implication; if people are unable to hold conscious discourse, is there any hope for humanity as a whole to resolve their differences and create a holistic world-vision?

"event","I am not sure how many of your have an interest in dreams, visions, traveling, the dreamtime, or bardo, yet for me it is fascinating. Jen recently found an article that describes dreaming as a process of reliving the day and experiences of our past, and I find it to be true.

Though, what is lived in the dream is not the details of the actual experience, rather it is the feelings of the experience which arise. The resistances, joys, excitements, things that trigger emotional reactions, the highs and lows of the day. Feelings that drive a person can create so many different effects in the waking world, and in the dreaming world can generate really bizarre dreamscapes.

Dreaming is a way to re-experience these feelings, and while there are many great books that describe how to dream using things like dream journals and mantras, the one technique that has been most effective for me is simply; self-awareness.

<lj-cut text=""Developing the dreaming ability is a fun and fascinating way to understand the depths of one's being. Self-awareness remains the foundational aspect for being awake in the dreamtime."">

The moment a person can recognize they are in a dream, there is a space of self-awareness opportunity which can be reinforced. In recognizing and reinforcing this self-awareness, more such openings present themselves.

While it is possible to alter the experiences of the dream, that is not important. In order to integrate unresolved feelings of the past, a person learns to be in the moment, while in the dreaming state. Knowing that it is a dream provides a safe-realm of exploration and resolution, because as the Dreamer, it is your personal realm where you have complete safety. 

Dream interpretation manuals are a massive waste of time. Throw them away, they have no meaning for the personal realm. Although, I have found that there are certain common elements to the dreaming experience; going underground is like entering the subconscious / unconscious mind, being inside represents certain mental patterns, a personal 'home' in the dreaming can represent the emotional balance, and traveling in dreams indicates a search for resolution or answers.

Flying dreams are typically the best for the simple reason that there is a greater degree of self-awareness. When a person has a flying dream, there are many theories about what they mean, the only thing that has been important for me is that the experience is so thrilling and powerful, I am able to instantly be self-aware."

"event","What is Faith? What is Belief? Are they the same, are there differences? In my opinion, they are completely different and have no relationship to one another. Unfortunately, faith and belief are confused in the modern world. A person who does not have a certain set of beliefs is often considered to be 'not of the faith,' and is an outsider, available to be punished for their transgression. Having a different set of beliefs can be exceptionally frightening and threatening for those who blindly cling to a belief system when there is no faith.

<lj-cut text=""Spare me from blind believers, let me only know those of faithful, loving hearts."">

<strong>Belief</strong> - <em>Having a belief in some knowledge, religion, or concept as a mental construct remains constrained by what the belief is. Beliefs are often unable to accept or accomodate what the 'belief' disagrees with. In having differing beliefs, and enforcing those beliefs, separative conflict is encouraged.</em>

<strong>Faith</strong> - <em>The natural expression of a person as who they are. Faith transcends beliefs, integrates persons of any creed, race, nationality or age. Faith in love heals wounds and nurtures peace. Faith in oneself develops confidence, willpower, and surety of action. Faith in others builds their abilities, develops holistic relationships, and encourages them to be wholesome and balanced.</em>


Beliefs are made to be challenged, beliefs can be fluid. A person can believe in love, yet how can belief of love be authentic between persons? Beliefs often times are only substantiated by certain books, dogmatic structures, limited sets of action, and group think. Removed from these supports, beliefs remain unprovable, hollow, and cold. Yet, people will go to war and kill one another over beliefs, literally through death and figuratively with insults, slanders and aggressions. This person never grows, they stagnate and are dead before their time, walking and not alive, robotic.

Faith can never be challenged. A person who is grounded in faith has a solid core, a foundation unshakeable by beliefs and concepts. The faith a person has is demonstrated not by their words or beliefs, it is self evident through action and the quality and types of relationships that person has in their life. A person of faith can question belief, hold dialogue about beliefs, and remains willing to allow the beliefs to change in support of faith. This person grows in wisdom, knowledge and compassion through time.

<strong>A person can believe in love, speak about love, appear to be very religious, yet demonstrate they have no faith in love. 

A person can have no beliefs in god, gods or religions, yet express their faith in love to every person who they encounter.</strong>

Consider:

<li>The preacher who teaches about god, faith, religion, and whose home life is a wreck, who is cheating on their spouses, stealing from their congregation. They have beliefs, yet operate outside the boundaries of what they preach, their actions instead teach that faith is dead. They may appear right and proper, yet the core is rotten. The same goes for the man of the house who abuses his wife and children, either physically, verbally or emotionally. For parents, siblings, friends, and teachers who say they encourage a person in life, yet undermine that person in subtle ways through expressions of discouragement, doubt, and who may even actively sabotage the efforts of their 'loved' ones. These type of people have no faith in love, their actions demonstrate their faith in fear, hatred, and anger. 

<strong>Hypocrisy between words and actions are one of the best indicators of the gap between belief and faith.</strong>

<li>How about the atheist who never goes to church, derides the belief in god, yet who has faith in humanity as being intrinsically good? This individual may be a social worker, supporting people in living their life dreams, silently serving those in need, not from a sense of religious righteousness, but only because at their core they understand what is most important in life. The belief structure is completely different, yet their actions demonstrate a loving nature that is the true heart of religion. This type of atheist may appreciate the irony.

<strong>Faith can never be chosen. It's an expression of who a person really is, no words are able to speak their faith, only action communicates the truth of a persons being.</strong>

Question all beliefs, diligently inquire, consciously act upon faith.

Question everything I have written here, do not believe me.

Question what you would say in response.

What do your actions say about your faith?

Spare me from blind believers, let me only know those of faithful, loving hearts.

"event","Ever see what is between the gaps of thought? In not thinking, does a person disappear? During sleep, when there is no active consciousness, does a person die? What are zen masters and new age writers speaking of when they say no-mind? How can you have no-mind, what does that mean?

It all gets pretty confusing at an intellectual level, so much can be said about transcending the mind. Nothing compares to direct understanding of a no-mind state, and words remain unable to fully express this level of being. 

<lj-cut text=""The Mystery of I Am that I Am"">

Every single person on the planet refers to their self as 'I Am.' I am Keith, and I am writing this. I am thirty-three, male, with long hair and tattoos. I am a yoga teacher, web designer, musician, artist, and writer. I am friends with numerous people. I Am able to start all of my sentences about me with 'I Am' and be absolutely accurate. Whatever follows 'I Am' changes, both between people, and for each individual through the course of time. 'I Am' young. 'I Am' old. 'I Am' healthy, and in shape. 'I Am' out of shape.

Also, you are able to say 'I Am' about so many things, and be absolutely accurate in your assessment.

However, 'I Am' remains the same within each person. This is why there is no sense of aging, though the body ages. Anything that can be said about 'I Am' remains a definition, and remains a form that changes in time. All of the descriptions that follow 'I Am' are always different for each person, and changes for the individual depending on their perception. 'I Am', itself, remains indescribable.

<strong>Yet, what is this 'I Am'? </strong>

'I Am' remains a space of contentless awareness that has no definition. 'I Am' is always present, awake or asleep, sickness or health, male or female. 'I Am' remains translucent, and operates in a paradigm beyond the scope of mental comprehension. 'I Am' remains liberated from the confines of time and space and is at the core of each individual. This is the common element to every human being, regardless of gender, age, race, nationality or belief.

<strong>Is 'I Am' the soul?</strong>

I really do not know, yet it is quite possible. 'I Am' has a language of feeling based alignment. Acting according to 'I Am' is a seventh sense of alignment, it guides a person into ethical action, and trusting in this non-mental aspect has brought tremendous transformation into my own life. 'I Am', when active in a persons life, becomes a well-spring of love. 'I Am', if it is not the soul, is certainly a different subtle aspect that guides a person into wise action and develops a harmonious relationship with the inner and outer world

<strong>How does a person know 'I Am'?</strong>

Awareness remains a very subtle aspect of the human being. Consider a human as a composite of elements; the physical body, the mental body, an energy body that fuels the body and mind, and this silent core every person calls 'I Am.' Self-discovery allows a person to recognize the layers of their being, coming into conscious relationship with their aspects and differences. Meditation allows a person to gradually develop a conscious relationship with the layers of their being, and as that relationship blossoms, so do the fruits of the spirit; love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.

This is a natural blossoming. Where a person can adapt behavior that appears loving, kind, gentle and look like they have self-control, often times such a person is living a sham. These fruits are a natural expression of the soul, and when a person has a strong, conscious, beneficial relationship within, these traits are a natural, effortless by product. There is no trying to be loving, a person simply is loving.

<strong>What does a person do to relate to 'I Am'?</strong>

Any action of the mind remains in the mind. Same with the physical body and energetic forms. These are never contentless, they operate within the space of awareness. Awareness, itself, remains difficult to directly observe. Anything that tries to get it, isn't it.

As a child learns, the self-seeker must take a similar approach. There will be mistakes, misunderstandings, misdirections, yet one thing must remain present: the intention to know the truth of love. Anything which is a form, that is an action, isn't it. So that just is dropped. There is no set way to come to this discovery, a person has to trust in themselves and be diligent in their search.

Ideally, a person can just know this 'I Am' right now. It is, afterall, always present, even when a person remains unaware of this subtle aspect. Unfortunately, the mind and it's language of identification and forms simply cannot comprehend the silence that it operates within. The mind always has limits and boundaries, operating in a realm of words, concepts and beliefs. 

<blockquote>Sooner or later, a seeker becomes tired and drops all the actions of truth-discovering, and in the gaps of mental action remains an opportunity to observe that even though the mind is not active or speaking, even though the body is still operating itself, and though energies ebb and flow within, there is a silent aspect which simply is aware. The first glimpse creates a paradigm shift, and the seeker develops a deeper relationship within, and the inner transformation is accelerated, and the blossoming bears fruit every day.</blockquote>

I Am that I Am.

"event","Learning a new skill, developing artistic abilities, creating musical aptitude, encouraging a healthy lifestyle, engaging in a process of self-discovery or unlearning of habitual traits all face one common obstacle; expectation. The endeavor to learn anything new, from mundane abilities to practices of spiritual relationship, is greatly accelerated with daily discipline, enjoyment of what is being learned, and coming to a healthy relationship with what is being engaged in. 

Expectations hinder the growth curve because in not meeting the expectations, a person becomes frustrated, angry, and squanders their resources in negative feelings and cyclical thought rather than directing all of the energy into the process of discovery.

All processes of learning are exceptionally private and individual.

<lj-cut text=""There are five elements that ensure success in mastering any trait, skill, or knowledge; holistic vision, daily discipline, tenacious perseverance, forgetting, and love."">

<li>Holistic vision gives the dream and desire a form to follow. A person who has no vision will want to learn something, yet remain unable to direct their energies and resources effectively. Vision is like the banks of a river that guides water, without which the water would just be a inert puddle. A person has to know and feel what it is they will master before anything else can happen.

<li>Forgetting is an essential tool to learning. One has to forget the dislike of learning discovered in schools, to let go of the beliefs about how learning should happen, to drop to demands that learning should be easy and provide immediate gratification. Unlearning old patterns allows creative expansion of vision, the infinite potential of the human being is unleashed with forgetting. Yet, without questioning habitual patterns of thought and action, one receives only old results, and often times becomes discouraged because expectations are not being met. Being a quitter never feels good, a heart felt vision must be realized.

<li>Daily discipline is the action that affirms the vision. Without action, all vision remains a simple dream, ephemeral, wispy, and having no substance. Discipline takes a person from day dreams into discovery, and by practicing every day the skill, trait, or knowledge a person wants to master, there is realization of the dream. Action that is erratic remains ineffective, yet through deliberate daily practice a person is able to see, first hand, the vision become substantial. This builds momentum that becomes unstoppable, which is necessary for the inevitable periods of frustration and inhibitions to learning which must arise.

<em>Learning always remains both easy and difficult, sometimes the subtle aspects of what is being mastered are immediately picked up. The expectation that learning must always be easy is the first expectation to forget. It isn't always easy, and there will be friction. Learning is a process of discovering the unknown, of making the unavailable available, of incorporating mystery into tangible results. The walls of resistance encountered in the learning process are a potential gold mine if a person keeps going.</em>

<li>Tenacious perseverance provides the power to move forward, even though one experiences frustration and inhibitions. Full realization of a dream or vision demands endurance, the weak always fail, the strong always endure and ensure success. If being a virtuoso were easy, the world would be full of them. Instead, we have a bumper crop of couch potatoes whose only legacy will be dreams of greatness. Endurance is the trait of mastery.

<li>Love remains the fuel for learning. We can learn anything we want, achieve any result, yet such an approach only remains in the realm of knowledge. Love pushes all boundaries, integrating the heart, mind and soul and providing results beyond imagination. Without love, whatever is being learned remains distant and cold, yet with love one becomes the embodiment of their hearts-expression.

Consider these examples:

<blockquote>A child wishes to learn piano because somebody else says that they should. It isn't what the child would like to learn, but they do so because it is requested of them. There is no heart in it, so the knowledge of piano playing remains inaccessible because there isn't any real interest. The discipline required to develop the ability remains absent. Though this child could be forced to persevere and become a talented piano player, the musical expression would remain clinical and only express technical aptitude.

A child wishes to learn to draw because they find themselves doing it anyways. A parent notices this child scribbling all over the place, there is obvious enjoyment of this skill. Having the child learn to draw is easy, they are already doing it, coming to an understanding of the intricate technical aspects of drawing is a natural next step. As time passes, this child becomes masterful at expressing their love through the artform of drawing, bringing into existence amazing artwork that moves the soul.

An adult wants to learn how to meditate, speak a new language, play an instrument, cook, be healthy. This adult has had bad experiences in school, and cannot get over the belief that learning has to be difficult, strenuous and painful. Though they dream, they cannot believe that learning can be enjoyable, and never take action. This person dies, unfulfilled, never daring to act upon their dream.

Another adult wishes to learn the same types of things, and also had bad experiences in school. Every person learns differently. Yet, this person is willing to try, and takes action. They start at the beginning, and though it is difficult at first, as this person progresses they observe how they learn and do more of what works for them. In other words, this person unlearns the old habits and beliefs about self-education, and discovers a new realm within themselves. Though the trait may be difficult to encourage at first, as aptitude and ability develops, love also blossoms. The initial resistances and difficulties that were encountered become incorporated into what is learned. This person is fulfilled in simply learning and expressing their talent, and learns to give it in a way that benefits everybody.</blockquote>

<strong>In being able to learn, life remains fulfilling. Growth in one area of life is growth in all areas of life, for the soul is nurtured and joy abounds in self-discovery.</strong>

What kind of example do you set?

"event","<strong>Definition:</strong> Ethics - moral principles of an individual

In a modern age of lawyers and legal rule, ethics has become uncommon, rare and precious. Law is able to justify unethical behavior, protect evil men, and rationalize action and behavior that is murderous, violent, demeaning, and humiliating. Law has been used to wage a war on drugs, a war in Iraq, to keep people in prison, to dismantle the American Bill of Rights through domestic spying and other legal invasions of privacy, and to empower the police to violate innocent people with no-knock warrants, road side searches, and racial profiling. 

Law is used for ethnic cleansing in Tibet, Darfur and Bosnia, and even recently, was the rationale for Russia's invasion of Georgia. Laws allow corporations to rape and pillage the planet, to remove prosperity from laborers, and to manipulate the very governments created by the people intended to serve the people. 

<em>Law, unchecked, becomes the face of evil, providing a sham-mask that must be stripped and revealed for what it truely is.</em>

<lj-cut text=""The stance of law is unable to abide an ethical individual, for the ethical person is absolutely lawless, they have no need of law."">

An individual who has a strong ethical core is unable to deliberately harm others, shuns lying, is unwilling to take advantage of others for personal gain, and is often compelled to address and correct the accidental wrongs they may create. Even in strenuous situations, this type of individual remains true to their core.

When circumstance calls, the actions of an ethical individual will change to meet the moment; lying to save a life, stealing to feed starving children, and even taking a life through self-defense. There is no telling how an ethical person will respond in tenuous situations, yet it will always be according to a deep, non-compromising morality.

Law demands obedience, and being non-compliant with the law is punishable by fines, imprisonment, and even death. A system of law can be manipulated to protect the guilty and damn the innocent. Law is fallible, and in trying to rationalize itself, creates a chaotic mess that never addresses the issues, and only puts bandaids on the real cause.

What is the real cause? 

<em>The fear that humanity has with one another, and with the power innate within each person. </em>

Instead of addressing that fear and learning to have a true relationship within and without, law attempts to control, manipulate, and coerce individuals into proper behavior. More and more laws are created as individuals find ways to get around the law. The result is a society that appears good on the outside, yet one that has a core of rotten putresence. 

<em>In a lawful society, the individuals who rise to leadership demonstrate the ethical code of the community. Observation of these persons reveals what is most important to people of a particular nation, society, or family.</em>

In an ethical state, there are no guilty and innocent, there are people who operate in harmony according to a core set of values; love, truth, compassion, and service that benefits the entire world of nature and mankind. These values are innate to human beings, each person is born with an ethical core. A child will always act ethically, even though their actions may be unlawful.

Unfortunately, the ethical core has been corroded through ignorance and a perpetuation of the belief that law is king. Now, countries and corporations murder innocents through justified, legalized zealotry, a juggernaut that if, unchecked, will destroy the world. 

Yet, in a state of fear, people will not question the law and will be compliant. The ones who make the laws have the guns and irrational justification to murder individuals who are not obedient.

<strong>Law is made to serve ethics. </strong>

When law begins to serve the interests of government, corporations, and law-enforcing agencies, a dictatorship and police state are formed. The actions of law-enforcing individuals can only be justified by law, and the most heinous of crimes can be enacted. The actions of Hitler were technically legal through German law, yet the entire world recognizes the depth of depravity and suffering created through his worldview.

<strong>Ethics is never able to serve law.</strong>

<em>An ethical individual resides in a state of anarchy, obeying neither law nor the demands of others.</em>

When a person is self-sourced, ethics naturally arise, and that individual operates in harmony with the world. An ethical individual may be at odds with the law, and rebel against its tyranny. This is how America first came into being, through the combined action of a core group of men whose ethics were so powerful that they altered the course of humanity and formed a country based on those beliefs.

<strong>The ethical individual challenges all systems of so-called order, for the core of ethics is always the same in each person, the expression of those ethics are simply different.</strong>

What is that core? Love, a power that can integrate persons of any age, race, creed, nationality, belief, and a variety of life purposes.

<strong>Learn love, and the world is transformed. Learning law and its enforcement, and the world is changed only through rebellion, force and death. The old system is replaced by a new system just as corrupt, though it may provide relief for a short period of time.</strong>

A state of ethical individuals shuns law, and a paradigm shift occurs where there is no rebellion, only a peaceful transformation of society that benefits all who are involved.

When a mass of people are acting in alignment with their ethical core, the tyranny of law is weakened, and only then does liberation and freedom occur.

Go Gandhi!

"event","Sun Tzu's Art of War has been a major influence in my personal quest. Two principles have demonstrated their worth for me time and again. The first is to know the enemy. The second is to utilize all resources in going to the heart of the matter, rather than squandering resources on lesser objectives.

<lj-cut text=""Understanding how the mind operates is akin to scouting the enemy. Meditation then addresses the cause inherent within the mind, instantly resolving numerous effects generated by a single cause."">

The entire universe seems to operate on a spectrum of polarities; day and night, male and female, hot and cold, up and down, centrifugal and centripedal, pain and pleasure, attraction and repulsion, birth and death. In between these polarities resides layers where both polarities are present, dusk and dawn between night and day, life and non-life between birth and death, tepid and luke warm temperatures between hot and cold, and even hermaphrodites incorporate both genders, or none in the case of cellular organisms, into one being.

These polarities then operate in a circular fashion, what comes before will come again, following one after the other in an endless cycle, to their various degree's of intensity.

The mind, as a part of the natural world, operates in similar polarities and cycles. 

It's primary purpose is to provide for the safety and well-being of the physical body. The experiences of the past and potential of the future exist solely within the mind, time remains a construct of the mental realm. Consider the mind to be a computer program operating with IF-THEN guidelines, reacting to stimuli in the same way, again and again. It creates the same effects over and over because it will respond to stimuli in identical ways.

A mind that has become identified with the senses and body has a self-image. This is an illusion of the self, and remains distant from the reality of the Self. This self-image is like a virus, using up valuable resources, squandering the real potential of the mind and obfuscating the potentials of the True Self. Eventually the entire system breaks down, and when a stress point is reached, one literally has a 'break down.'

The mind, acting to preserve the health and wellness of the body and itself, will then attempt to correct the situation. Unfortunately, the mind cannot purge itself of this self-image 'virus', and often times will approach self-healing with the same attitudes, beliefs, perceptions and actions that initially caused the breakdown in the first place.

Sun Tzu says to address the cause, to go right to the heart of the matter.

In fighting the mind and attempting to still the mind, mental activity and agitation increases. 

So what is the singular cause that, when addressed, will bring the mind to reflective calm?

I feel that cause is difficult to quantify, yet simply: love. A person who lacks love is not whole, they are disconnected from an inner power house, and are in a self-destructive cycle. With an internal misalignment, stress builds like teutonic plates within the earth, eventually causing earthquakes.

Addressing a singular cause, discovering the essential alignment and acting upon it, feeling it, expressing that source and bringing it into every single layer and aspect of life, instantly resolves the numerous effects caused by a lack of love.

Consider:

A person who is naturally loving will be at peace with their own self. They enjoy life, their actions, their friends and family, and are generally happy, joyous people. These types of people tend to be peacemakers, and are naturally blessed, or lucky, simply because a person who is at ease will be most effective at living, and will receive the greatest benefits. No energies are squandered in a loving state, all power is directed to giving and receiving love.

A person who has forgotten love will be at odds with their own self. They may find pleasure in certain areas of life, and in getting pleasure will become addicted to it as a means of soothing the pain created by a lack of love. The greater the internal misalignment, the stronger the addictions and means of distracting oneself. The mind, attempting to find love will enter a realm of pain and pleasure, and travel the spectrum in a continuous cycle, finding pleasure (calling it love), fearing it's loss, and when it goes away, experiencing pain. This person will use their energy to get what they want, fight what they do not want, and build stresses within and eventually creating earthquakes.

Yet, how does a person come to know love when they've forgotten it?

Love is a feeling sense that transcends the mind. For all the poetic words and songs written about love, none of them are able to be love. Love remains ephemeral, outside the realm of words, yet accessible with direct experience. We have all experienced love, in the right circumstances, and in trying to create those circumstances again, miss the mark. That is the action of the mind, the computer program in it's cycles.

Feeling love remains a non-verbal experience that requires intimacy, truth, kindness, communication, compassion, and action ... all on the inside.

Love is not pleasure. Pleasure, as part of the natural realm, is healthy until it becomes addiction. Then, in achieving pleasure, pain is instantly present and must eventually come to the surface.

Love, as a feeling sense, remains in the moment. There is no thinking of love. There is being love. There is no achieving love, one is loving. There are no demands of love, one can simply give it or be receptive to it.

And we all know what love is. When one see's it and experiences it, there is no doubt, only love.

There is nothing to learn in meditation except to recognize how the mind operates, to embrace and be aware of the subtle currents inherent within the being. As one becomes attuned to the energetic embrace of love, one becomes naturally loving and giving. Love allows the mind to become still.

When the mind is at war, peace cannot exist. 

By fighting the war, the war persists.

In embracing and accepting love, and bringing it into all levels of life, into every aspect of ones being, love blossoms and becomes a natural gift to one's soul that instantly nourishes others.

All one has to do is find a seed of that love within and nurture it every moment to the best of one's ability. That becomes the only choice, to serve love, or to reject it.

"event","The singlest most difficult part of meditation has to do with the part of oneself that cannot be seen. In short, one is self-ignorant, simply unable to recognize aspects of their own being. Lacking knowledge of oneself is a critical error that has several results, a stressful mind and difficulties in relationships, reistance to reality, being at odds with people and the world, and as tensions accumulate can very literally result in physical and mental illness.

<strong>Meditation is an artistic process that allows a person to discover the depths of their own being, a way for a person to enlighten themselves through a gradual process of inner inquiry.</strong>

<em>Meditation begins as a journey of walking the territory of one's own being, recognizing that different parts of the internal realm operate in unique and distinct ways. You can only start with where you are at, never with where you want to be at the end.</em>

At first the path is dark and treacherous, there is a great amount of fear yet at the same time, an immense amount of courage. The initiative and power it takes to actively face the truth inherent within oneself is rare and unusual. Ironically, when a person begins meditative practices they are normally at a low point in their life and caught in a web of criticism, doubt, judgments and self-directed abuse and aggression. They remain unable to see and appreciate their own positive traits, let alone have the capacity for subtle insight. 

<lj-cut text=""The ability to love oneself is a result of natural meditation."">

Techniques of self-discovery such as meditation provide a means yet are never the end-result for self-realization, they are flashlights to pierce the darkness. One still has to walk. Enduring discipline and effortful engagement eventually become endearing practices and delights for discovering the soul.

<em>Mind and it's active voice of identification and blind pride are constant challenges to meditation.</em>

<blockquote>The causal core of the human being always remains timeless, infinite, ineffable. In identification with a thought, concept or belief the soul becomes bound by the thought, concept or belief that one adheres to. The timeless becomes captured within time, and becomes subject to the laws of time, and suffers the consequences of cause and effect when it doesn't have to. Mastery of mind leads to an ability to be aware of thoughts, to recognize their purpose and relationship with the internal and external worlds, yet remain absolutely liberated.</blockquote>

Meditation is an awareness space where thoughts arise yet one is able to not be pulled into the emotional nature of thoughts and beliefs. There is no need to do anything about the thoughts that one is able to see, any grasping or aversion to these reveals a misalignment. Then the only problems that arise come from aspects within that remain invisible, and in doing so provide an opportunity for permanent resolution.

<em>The strongest indication of an active mind is the loudness and captivating power of internal mind-speak. </em>

Every human one this earth talks to themself in some fashion, whether they recognize it or not. Most individuals are not aware of this self-speak, and simply are ensnared within the mind and it's voice. The rest are crazy or wonder if they are. Through meditation a person is able to disengage from mental chatter and abide within a silent core, allowing the mind to do its thing, untouched. By not touching thoughts, one remains free of their binding nature. 

<strong>Meditation becomes a process of unlearning the old and rediscovering how to relate to what life presents now.</strong>

It is helpful to understand how the mind operates. Like all things in nature, there is a pattern, order, and place. For the mind that place is as the steward and caretaker of day to day life. A loving, kind, receptive mind creates a prosperous life, while a greedy, selfish, limited mind results in suffering and misfortune. The mind acts in circular cycles, what has come before will come again. Life presents the same events over and over because the mind see's it exactly the same, reacts to it the same, and receives the same results. 

<em>The mind will take experiences of the past, and either fearing the past or being attracted to it, will act in ways to ensure that it will receive more of the pleasure that it likes and receive none of the pain that it does not like.</em>

The identified mind, however, is literally unable to feel pain and pleasure. It is ensnared within the concepts of what pain and pleasure is, wrapped within a self-image that buffers a person from the experiential, visceral sensations of pain and pleasure that arise in the body. There is plenty of thought about pain and pleasure, there is very little conscious relation to how pain and pleasure really feel within the body.

<strong>The body speaks in a continuum of pain and pleasure with the sole purpose of maintaining a healthy, homeostatic balance.</strong>

A person who is hungry or thirsty will feel pain, and upon satiation, pleasure arises. The same with needing to use the bathroom, or urges for physical affection or sexual sation, or the need to sleep or rest. The mind, speaking a language of words and concepts, is often times out of touch with what the body is really communication. By believing that 'It Is As It Is,' then it is easy to feel pain of thirst as a pain of hunger, and to eat rather than drink water and fluids that body really craves. While the example is simplistic, the implication is one of the mind being totally disconnected from the body and having no conscious understanding of bodily needs, cycles, and how to relate and nurture the body. It's out of touch with it's own inner reality, and consequently, all of reality.

<strong>The mind will take a non-physical experience that occurred, identify it as painful or pleasurable, and then that response arises a stress response in the body. </strong>

The past never resolves itself and comes to reside within the mental, physical and emotional bodies, acting as stimuli and creating unconscious, reactive actions. Often times these experiences will become a belief that dictates how a person lives, and it will never be questioned or looked at for all of life. A person is then bound, unable to respond to what life is really offering, and simply relives the experiences of the past even when this very moment is absolutely fresh, it has never before existed. 

<em>Simply, people forget why they do what they do and simply chase what one perceives as pleasure while simultaneously living in fear of pain.</em>

Being responsible as a caretaker of day to day life, mind has control over the body and it's energies. The mind, strongly identified, will believe that it is supreme and create disharmony within the human being through neglecting the real needs of the body, mind, and life sustaining energies. The cure remains simple, the mind as an unruly child has to mature and understand it's relationship with the other aspects of the holistic human being. 

<blockquote>The nature of one's inner relationship has strong reflection in the quality and fulfillment of relating to other people, play and work, nature and the world at large. Addressing the one internal cause immediately realigns all of the external effects. Rather than fixing other people and fighting infinite effects, resolving the singular cause of how the mind operates immediately alters everything else within the world. Through learning to love oneself, by bringing the mind into a healthy relationship within, the world is changed for the better and automatically improves the lives of all who come into contact with you, directly or indirectly.</blockquote>

Dismantling the strong mental voice of identification requires a paradigm shift for the human being. The mind, in order to not be bound by it's own self-image, simply has to go through a process of inquiry and discovery. Life will eventually force events onto every person that shake the foundations of their being, requiring deep introspection. the fortunate grow beyond their previous limits, the unfortunate repeat the same cycle, their own private hell.

<em>Rather than being forced into the corner to face reality, take a pro-active response with meditative practices. Investigating one's true nature and redefining the inner relationship is the first step is that the mind must have a foundation of seeing itself and being recognizing it's own nature, and the sobering results of it's actions. Yet, the active mind is simply invisible to itself, coming to knowledge of oneself starting from a place of ignorance can be challenging. Ensared with identification, the mind simply engages in meditation with the exact same patterns it has used during all of existence. </em>

<strong>The mind that starts the process of meditation attempts to fix itself. This is like a surgeon who tries to self-lobotomize, disaster results. Another approach is necessary. </strong>

<em>One has to start at the very beginning, with what is present, and continue to look with introspective questioning every single step of the journey.</em>

Integration and being whole are the results of what a person expects from meditation. All of the books have the smiling buddhas and jolly yogi's, the smiling swami's and zen masters who have figured out the silly profundities of life. The results of meditation are well-known and desirable, scientifically demonstratable and medically proven and accepted. The impatience of the mind to have the end result is one of the first mental habits and beliefs to be relinquished, because as a person quickly discovers, meditation does not always offer what is expected. Instead of getting the results of meditation, a person receives experiences that often times are disintegrating and discouraging.

Being centered and silent has to start with the mind learning to let go of it's pride and beliefs about what to expect from meditation, and instead approaching what it is doing through direct, keen observation and inquiry. The mind, in order to go beyond itself, has to work with what is already present on the internal realm. The active mind is self-ignorant, and in order to be self-aware, one starts with the simplest and grossest part of one's being, getting to know an aspect of our self that is always present and rarely directly related to; the body.

<em>How the body and mind communicate are completely different, each has it's own language. The body cannot understand the mind, yet the mind has the ability to understand and relate to the body.</em>

When one learns to meditate on body sensations, an intimate internal language is developed. Nobody else can ever understand this relationship, it is unique. This language develops by first observing the body and it's sensations. The body, speaking in a language of pain and pleasure, is unable to learn words and thoughts and beliefs. It is in the moment, simple and innocent, regardless the activities mind has body engage in. It is up to the mind to learn how to listen to the body and develop an ability to set aside what it believes about the body, and to be in simple relation.

At the personal level, the body speaks in a language of internal observation and sensation. The body speaks in all of the senses. The mind follows and puts a label on what the senses experience, one step behind reality, forming a belief or concept about what has already happened. Meditation bridges the gap with all encompassing, contentless awareness.

<strong>The body, absorbed in sensation, is always in the moment, and observation and conscious relation to internal body process is an easy foundation for meditative practices.</strong>

Anchoring the mind to bodily based functions allows the mind to grow silent, automatically. Feeling the breath move through the body, deliberating relaxing the muscular system, observing body pulses and micromovents, slow motion in combination with breathing, all serve as tools for stilling mental action, and allowing a clarity to arise. In this clear space, with diligent practice, one comes to recognize that the mind isn't awareness, that there is an expansive consciousness that embraces the mind, and body sensations, and energetic alignment, all at once, simultaneously. It just has no content, it doesn't touch anything, it's just very, very quietly receptive.

<strong>Mental action to any degree indicates a timelag of mind to reality, increasing the indications of misalignment as its activity increases in agitation and ferocity. </strong>

The mind, active in its own way, misses what the body experiences in the senses. The mind filters out experiences pouring in through the senses by only focusing on a narrow spectrum called 'i like pleasure' and 'i run from pain.' The body is always absorbing information through the senses, and as a part of the natural world, is constantly, actively balancing the forces of creation, nurturing, and destruction to keep the body in natural, homeostatic and healthy balance. The ability to allow and be receptive to what arises within one's field of perceptions is called awareness, and awareness can expand infinitely.

<strong>As awareness expands through unraveling mental patterns and developing a clarified mindset, one travels deeper into the unexplored mystery of the human being.</strong>

The body is alive only because it is animated by a living energy. This living energy makes it's presence known through the action of breath. A person is born into the world and they inhale, and their last exhalation is the departure into death. Developing a relationship with the functions of the body allows a person to first bring into awareness, and then develop a conscious relationship with the energetic, animating forces that sustain the body and mind.

<em>This energetic force that vivifies the body and empowers the senses has an innate intelligence that automatically sustains, rebuilds, and purifies the body at all levels and in all of its operation.</em>

The electrifying power that moves the body, triggers electrical responses, pumps hormones and blood, processes food, eliminates waste, is also responsible for quality of mental functioning. A clear, strong, pure relationship with the internal energies ensures a powerful, awake, aware, alert and responsive consciousness, a healthy body, a reflective mind, and strong sense of feeling connected to the worlds both within and without.

Meditation is never a process of stopping the mind. Instead, consider meditation to be the relationship of the mind with the energies that empower it. When the mind becomes quiet on its own, relating to the present moment and energetic flow of energies as they wax and wane, the human being is operating in the natural rhytms of life at all levels of existence; microscopic to macroscopic, cellular to interstellar, quarks to galaxies, internal realm to external world. 

<em>Meditation blossoms into a moment to moment alignment to the inner and outer realms, in action with the cause of reality rather than reacting to impact and effect on the mind, able to consciously choose the type of relationship one is to have with oneself and others here and now.</em>

When one see's the mystery of who 'I Am' is, and the relationship of all the world of forms with this formless awareness, self-knowledge begins to blossom.

Bloom on.

"event","Meditation, an artform of stilling the mind demonstrated by science to have numerous  benefits for any human being. Eager for the benefits touted by  meditation such as a calm mind, less stress, increased intelligence, and the  possibility of enlightenment, most beginning meditators begin with one thing in  common; they think about meditation.

<B>The novice will approach meditation in the same exact way that everything else in  their life has been, with the mind. The resulting experience will also be the same.</B>

A person who is intellectual will gather knowledge about meditation and think about it, and  when it comes time to meditating end up sitting on a cushion thinking about why  their mind isn't calming, stopping, or coming to silence, or all the other things they know about meditation. When all of the books on  meditation claim that meditation requires no mind, or stilling the mind, or any  number of methods for negating the mind, a person new to the artform of meditation  will take to heart an idea of what they are looking for and the way the experience  should be, and will be discouraged when the expectation is not being fulfilled.

<B>A beginner will attempt to use the mind to address the activity of the mind. </B>

This is adding fuel to a fire, any mental action is part of the action that one  wishes to still. The mind, believing in the omnipotence of its own power yet  abiding with unconscious fear of oblivion, believes that it is the problem and the  solution. This occurs when a person is deeply identified with the voice of mind and  has forgotten how to relate to the rest of their being. The mind is simply too loud,  and this is why a person looks to meditative practices in the first place. Yet, the  mind that creates the problem cannot be its own solution.

<lj-cut text=""Meditation is a response that occurs within the entire being."">

Take heart my intrepid readers, for there is a simple answer to this common  obstacle. Designed by nature and hardwired into our systems is a method for  self-knowledge and experiencing our fullest possibility as a human being. That  understanding is available to anybody, and take 'body' literally, for the key to  meditation resides within the physical form and not within the mind.

<B>The mind is part of a holistic relationship network that, as a whole, creates a  single human being.</B>

Like any system found in nature, a human being is comprised of many levels, a  physical body, an energetic power system, a mind, and the soul. Every aspect of  the human being has it's own unique language and method of communication. The mind must learn the language of these different self-aspects in order to be fully present and at peace.

<I>The mind that is burdened by stress is in a bad relationship with the other levels of their human being. Creating a harmonious relationship within alleviates internal stress.</i>

Meditation occurs when the mind learns how to relate to the inner world, coming into  alignment with the natural operation of the body and its energetic system, and  learning to listen to the ethical, guiding wisdom of the soul.

A noisy mind is like a teenager listening to music through earphones, and often  times though it can hear the parents speaking, chooses to pretend to ignore what is  being said. The noisy mind is always able to hear the guiding wisdom of the soul. Through the years sensitivity to this seventh sense diminishes and one becomes lost and burdened by feelings of depression, anger, jealousy, hesitations or fear

<I>Meditation in its purest form allows a person to reconnect to the essential, core  self. Re-establishing this internal link brings joy, health, prosperity, abundance  and positive relationships into a persons life. In short, one is able to find  meaning in life, fulfillment in day to day activities.</i>

<B>The mind, seeking silent solace from lifes stresses, only needs to learn how to  directly relate to the body.</B>

The first step to meditative awareness is to become directly conscious of the  sensations within the body. The body does not communicate with words, its language consists of visceral pain and pleasure in various mixtures and scales. Mind, believing it knows everything about the body, often misinteprets the needs of the body. The natural result is a body that is an unhealthy, imbalanced body and a corresponding mental and emotional state.

I've never heard of an enjoyable bad relationship, and though one may not be aware of the body-mind relationship, every person is greatly impacted by how they relate to their physical form. Learning to recognize body-centric communication keys is totally personal and requires self-knowledge, curiosity, trusting in an internal wisdom.

<B>Practices that incorporate breath, body and awareness  provides a cornerstone technique for building a new mental paradigm. </B>

The agitated  mind must have its pressure alleviated, and utilizing the physical mechanism  introduces a literal, chemical relaxation response into the body. The mind and its  activity, operating within the brain, responds by entering a meditative state.

Slow breathing exercises are ideal for this purpose, focusing on the literal  sensations within the body as the breathing occurs triggers a meditative state. As  the mind calms, subtle sensations arise within awareness, be aware of those  sensations. Any enjoyable activity that allows a person to be conscious of their  body and relax into its sensations is suitable; dancing or singing, tai chi or  running, yoga or swimming, walking or eating.

Techniques of connecting to body sensations that are subtle, such as breath control, allow a person to maintain a meditative state throughout the day and provides a pressure valve in the moment that stressful events are occuring. Rather than dealing with the effects of stress, a meditative state allows liberation by resolving tension as it arises, addressing the singular cause of so many of life's tribulations immediately rather than trying to fix the its effects down the road.

My favorite meditation tool is the heartbeat. This is the very organ that keeps the  body alive, yet when the mind is very active the essential life rythm present inside  the body is forgotten. A mind that is very loud has difficulty finding the sensation  of the heartbeat, yet its pulses fill the entire body through circulation. As the  mind calms, this pulse can be felt in other areas of the body, and eventually  everywhere blood circulates. Feeling the heartbeat is a powerful tool to remaining centered all day long.

<B>An unlearning process is triggered as the mind learns to relate to the body.</B>

Relinquishing old habits, patterns and stresses experienced in life allows the mind  to expand its boundaries and to be more receptive of what occurs in life. As body  centric meditation is developed, an expansive awareness develops and a relationship  is built with the other subtle bodies present within the human being. As the burden of residual tensions held within the complex human are dropped, appreciation for the results in ones personal life becomes the support to effortless maintain practices that support holistic health and an integrate state of being,

When meditation is a space of contentless awareness that is receptive to the activity of the mind, and everything thing equally while remaining unchanged or moved, one is able to set aside the techniques and magic tricks and just see who they are, and perceive reality directly, and be in the moment. There is no need to stop the mind, one simply learns to relate to the holistic mind and its patterns, entering into an integrated understanding with oneself.

"event","There are techniques for learning how to consciously engage the mind, when practiced diligently these disciplines blossom in amazing ways. The combination of bodily observation with breath is a powerful key for self-realization, with both body and breath being powerful tools for engaging our consciousness. Diligent, long-term practice of yogic discipline yields results beyond imagination.

Through determination for self-growth, one is able to apply techniques of consciousness, and progressively grow their own well-being and sense of purpose in life. The short explanation is that we essentially become relaxed, both physically, emotionally and mentally, progressively engaging and integrating more and more of our energetic potential, and living a fuller and happier life. The process of this relaxation would be dependent on the will to follow through with the intention, and laughter, surrender, and patience are essential aspects to this path.

This essay is an attempt to energetically convey with total lucidity a literal, physical, down to earth technique of engaging the mind with the body. To make it clear up front, this technique does not provide results overnight. It requires diligent practice, yet as one would tend a garden, the blooms from these practices are most elegantly appreciated. The process of learning and engaging conscious awareness needs to itself become engaging. These techniques may help you to do so.

"event","Consider enlightenment to be a complete enchilada, a tasty array of beans, onions, cheese, and peppers wrapped in tortilla goodness. One can take any single ingredient of the enchilada and have a tasty meal, but the single component is never the complete enchilada. One can eat the beans of any philosophical belief system, digest the dogmatic concepts of religions and group think, existing in a wonderful, clouded presence that smells like roses only to oneself and those who perpetuate such beliefs. 

One can chow down the singular ingredients; the onions of energy practices, the cheese from spiritual teachers and enlightened texts, the peppers of meditative silence, and the tortilla of soul-spirit that holds it all together, yet in and of themselves there is no completeness. There is no enchilada.

Arguing that the beans, onions, peppers or cheese is a complete enchilada is never accurate, they are mere ingredients, singular parts that have their use, that can be eaten and fullfilling, but its obviously not an enchilada. 

Yet, this seems to be where most individuals get stuck, arguing about ingredients, discussing the potency of their beans, clouding consciousness with big, blinding blasts of verbiage.

Only when all the ingredients are compiled does one directly experience the enchilada, simply ingesting its enjoyable completeness and having absolute satisfaction.

<I>The prestige of the government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition law. <U>For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.</u> It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this.

There is also another way in which Prohibition, in my opinion, undermines the authority of the government. The public house is a place which gives people the opportunity to exchange views and ideas on public affairs. As far as I can see, such an opportunity is lacking in this country, the result being that the Press, which is mostly controlled by vested interests, has an excessive influence on public opinion.</i>

"event","Having practiced the forms of yoga for years, I have come to a deeper understanding of yoga.

<B>The yoga which can be instructed and communicated, is not yoga.</B>

All the forms of yoga are techniques which are guidelines and methods for discovering yoga, yet which in and of themselves, can never be yoga. A person who practices these techniques can be ensnared by methods, and never be in a state of yoga. And a person who never practices 'yogic discipline' may discover and reside within the state of unification, as has been seen in the many practices available in different cultures & around the world.

<lj-cut text=""Yoga in its meaning of 'Unification' is a timeless state of being which is beyond form, defying description, and that is only self-evident.""> 

I am really switching the word 'yoga' for the word 'tao'. Lao Tze's immortal words are 'The tao which can be spoken is not the eternal tao.' No word, no discussion, no action is ever that eternal essence beyond form. 

The form can be a path, a bridge to realizing the state of yoga, yet itself is not that timeless state of being.

As I see marketing efforts and all kinds of spiritual groups believing that yoga is mere posture, or breathing, or exercise, or touting that yoga is _the way_ to enlightenment, and then acting with violence and separation to prove that their yoga is 'authentic', I question what it is that creates the separation. 

As I see it the one cause is simply the egoic-mind which is bound by time and form, the source of all stress. 

In attachment to a belief that yoga 'is this, and is not that' conflict inevitably arises between those who have an agenda to prove that what they know is 'the truth.' It's this blinding attachment which has masterful instructors sow division and confusion in the ranks of those who wish to understand and know.

The truth of yoga is self-evident, and only becomes available to one who delves inward, resolving their self-judgments and relinquishing control of the habitual, distressing patterns of the mind.

This state of being does not require yoga postures, or breathing, or guru worship, or anything. It simply is what it is, and appears through a process of surrendering what 'one is not.' People in all cultures, religions and professions have experienced and discovered the state of silent unity, in their own way and through their own methods. Many of whom probably never even knew or recognized the state of unification, and were 'simply being themselves.'

This does not mean that yogic techniques are useless, they are very powerful for a person who seeks inner knowing. Simply, the techniques are techniques, and may lead one to a unified state, yet are not in and of themselves, 'the eternal yoga.'

"event","Honesty is critical to the health and well-being of any relationship. Dishonesty, present in any form and in any amount, becomes a toxin which inevitably diminishes the relationship, and creates separation. When a person is dishonest it creates an additional burden of guilt, shame, insecurity, and a host of other negative ramifications that lead to personal devastation. Yet, it can be real hard to be honest, with others and most especially with ones own self. 

<lj-cut text=""The truth that a person feels may not be the truth that a person wants to believe and will communicate and present to the world."">

As usual, when I mean relationship I am primarily referring to the subjective relationship a person has with their own self, and how that relationship is present and reflects upon all objective relationships involving people, work, health, and objective life.

Searching for the untruths carried within is akin to setting aside chains and stepping from a dungeon. Every subjective self deception that is revealed allows its liberating impact to be experienced in all objective relationships.

Yet, seeing the truth of oneself, and being honest is often times scary, unwanted, and unbelievable. The truth that mind will create based on past impressions and actions is often times misaligned with the silent, knowing truth that a person carries within their own self. It is easy to accept the programming of the mind and see it as truth, because that is just the way it was so that must be how it is. 

<b>Understanding the truth beyond mind changes everything, one must walk into the unknown.</b>

How often I have known a truth, and acted against it, only to reap chaos. And often times, I have acted upon a truth which was not logical, that made no sense, only to have everything magically work out.

<i>Yet, this truth that I refer to has nothing to do with the mind and its perceptions, beliefs and dogmas. It is a quiet, feeling truth.</i>

For me, it is an alignment within myself. When I am acting and speaking in alignment, I cannot feel that centering, I only know its effects. I know immediately when I am misaligned. When I am misaligned all kinds of messes get made in life. All I have been able to observe is that it is a matter of self-truth.

<b>Truth razes all belief systems and destroys every perception, thus allowing liberation to unfold.</b>

When I speak of truth, it is a discernment that operates outside of normal programming. It questions the very foundations of life, of the mind, of beliefs and perceptions. <u>This kind of truth can never, ever be justified.</u> It is a feeling of alignment and harmony, clarity, conviction and surety of purpose. This truth has no need to communicate or justify it's existence, it is self-evident. It simply is what it is.

<i>When truth is known, change happens instantly just through awareness. </i>

.


Definitions:
<i>Subjective Relationship</i> = the relationship one has with ones own essential self. This is the relationship with the quiet aspect, the internal Knowing part.

<i>Objective relationship</i> = the relationship a person has with any objects in the world. That which can be observed is not subjective, it is objective. This includes the physical body, the mind, people, places, things, history, society, governments, work and action, and anything else."

"event","While pondering the meaning of a relationship with oneself a basic bad-relationship came to thought; that of the mind feeling isolated, disconnected and alone. A mind that feels that way becomes the 'ego', and strives to protect itself at any and all cost. Such an ego-mind will harm not only others, but also the body in which it is housed through physical or psychological means.

A mind which recognizes that it is not alone, and that it has a constant ally, becomes calm. It recognizes that no longer does it need to do everything, and that it has really never done anything in the first place. 

The mind which recognizes that it is in a relationship with the body and its energetic currents, is able to let go of the fight and flight struggle which otherwise defines its existence.

Where does this relationship begin?

<lj-cut text=""Equanimity of mind, stability of emotions and effective relationships in life only occur once the mind becomes yoked, anchored, and centered within the body."">

First, a distinction. There is a common belief that meditation is about silencing the mind. The mind does not become silent by the actions of the mind, a mind that attempts to be still remains in action. Consider first why the mind moves and why it would need to be silent.

The mind only moves for two reasons; natural movement of the mind that sustains the health and well-being of the body, and unnatural movement of the mind that sustains the health and well-being of the egoic-self image. Both movements of mind can occur in an infinite variety of ways, the important aspect is the cause for mental movement.

Why does a person seek silence of the mind? To be free from its draconian punishments and constant driving force that stems from fear, resistance, guilt, and the need to prove something or force reality to conform to its narrow perception.

<B>A person can feel, although may not be aware, of the harmful impact of the unconsciously driven mind.</B>

These feelings are often expressed as emotions, and the painful words and actions that can stem from emotions. These are methods of releasing the steam of feeling, which is non-verbal and resides as tension & stress within the body.

As the feeling of disconnection grows stronger through the mind's service of the ego, it will struggle more and more, and this creates a progressively increasing amount of stress that is <i>felt</i>, both in the body and in all expressions of life.

Thus, a person who is aware of something being 'disconnected' and of needing 'more' will eventually, through the process of suffering and pain, be drawn to introspection and self-observation. The amount of time before a person wakes to such recognition differs, some never even bother to look.

Of those that begin to seek their solution, their method of approaching release from ego-bondage, will be the same exact same approach used in the rest of their life. Thus, a seeker who is forceful and egoic will approach their inner quest with force and ego. A person who acts from hesitation and fear in life, will approach their own self with hesitation, doubt and fear. 

<B>The disconnected actions of mind will remain disconnected until the mind is able to make an operational paradigm shift from thinking to being.</B>

A new way of mental operation must be discovered, yet when a person only knows how they have acted in the past, and has often done so unconsciously, they will continue to act the same way. The cycle of mind and action must be addressed, the pattern of how one thinks and acts must be observed. Yet, observation is only part of the puzzle.

<B>The best relationship the mind can have for diminishing it's fear and surrendering it's control of what occurs during life is the mind's relationship with the body.</B>

By observing the body and its natural actions, one is able to connect with their feeling center, and to also know as truth that the mind is not running the show, though it thinks it is. The mind does not make the subtle functions of the body happen, the heart beats itself, the blood pulses through pressure, food digests itself, neurons are firing without being asked. And within the universal body we do not make gravity hold us down, or the earth to spin, or the sun to shine and some how create a planet teeming with life.

<I>The mind never makes anything happen, yet that is what it believes and struggles to do. In all the mechanisms of the universe that occur without the help of my mind, including the operation of the body itself, how can the mind ever be the doer? This one, tiny little thing is making EVERYTHING happen? It's the biggest joke people play on themselves, and they commit slow suicide each moment in their belief.</i>

Consider, how well do you know your body?

<li>Most people will have a story about their body (I am young, I am old, I hurt here, I am ugly, I am sexy) ... this is language about the body, and has nothing to do with the body itself. What can you say about the body that is not a label?
<li>Many people misinterpret the signals their body put out, or are simply unaware of what the body communicates through sensation. As this occurs, the body builds stress and becomes sick. Try an experiment, next few times you think you are hungry or tired, especially mid-afternoon, drink water and see if that makes a difference.
<li>Because of likes and dislikes, the ego-mind will operate the body on what it believes is appropriate, and through non-listening will harm the body by putting food and substances into the body which harm it. It will also drive the body beyond its limits through thoughtless action.
<li>What is the real purpose of pain? How can pain be wrong when the body uses it to communicate to the mind that it is thirsty, or hungry, or that it has a need to go to the bathroom. If a person had appendicitis without pain, they would die because they would not know what happened.
<li>What is purpose of pleasure? Most people just become addicted to pleasure, and the ego-mind uses the body as a carnival of sensual gratification. This over-stresses the body, and squanders its energetic resources.

Pain and pleasure are the two key words to contemplate when observing the body. Between these two polarities is a vast amount of sensation, yet the mind will often just label the variety of sensations as pleasurable 'I like it' or as painful 'I do not like it.' This begins the whole cycle of avoiding pain and choosing pleasure. It also shuts out a huge area of life, all of the 'grey' areas between 'right' and 'wrong', and greatly limits ones experience of life.

<I>Pain and pleasure are not to be chosen for or against. The pain and pleasure of the body are indications of what needs to be addressed for survival and health, they simply exist.</i>

<B>The pain and pleasure that the ego-mind experiences is illusionary, and does not exist. </B>

A bruised self-image will not kill a person, yet the illusionary pain will create a literal impact in the body due to identification. This is the cause of stress, where what seems to be painful in life due to relationship or circumstances becomes identified and digested energetically, and then the body must react to defend or protect itself.

<I>Disentangle the personal ego-identification which turns what simply is in life into a stressful and personal encounter which requires action to fight or fix, manipulate, control or remove.</i>

The ego-mind which comes to recognize how its own actions impact it's embodied residence becomes to wake up to the most important of relationships, the one that occurs internally and silently. A very personal relationship, the kind of intimacy and honesty a person must have to be in a good relationship with ones own self, can only occur in the presence of love.

<I>The ego-mind which is driven by fear can be likened to a blockage in a river stream, its presence clogs the free movement of water. Except, within the body, this blockage dams the very movement of life energies which sustain, nurture and heal the body.</i>

As a person is able to enter their body, which can only occur through direct engagement of sensation, fear loses its motivating grip. The blockages of energy then dissolve, and the freedom of life and well-being that the mind craves becomes realized, effortlessly in every moment.

This happens in two ways, as a gradual process with little shifts each day, and at times a massive release will occur, creating a paradigm shift and refreshed consciousness. During the process of purification, awareness expands according to ones depth of self-honesty and the ability to release that which harms the internal relationship.

<B>The mind that is able to enter the body becomes yoked, and enters into a homeostatic balance. </B>

<I>It is not necessary to still and remove the mind, it has an important purpose in day to day life, the key is to bring it into balance with the body.</i>

<U>Balancing the mind never occurs from learning something new, it only occurs by unlearning that which you think you are.</u>

As the unlearning process unfolds, one sees the truth of who they are, and the natural and healthy relationship that mind and body were meant to have, becomes real.

Yet, the key is to start, today, a little by little.

YOU HAVE TO DO IT, NOT THINK ABOUT IT. A RELATIONSHIP CAN ONLY DEVELOP WITH CONSCIOUS ATTENTION AND ACTION.

<B>How do you build a relationship between the body and mind?</B>

Through it's sensations. The body has no language of words, it only speaks through sensation. A person must be willing to be intimate inside their own body, to feel their body inside and out, constantly.

Breath is a traditional way of maintaining this connection, breathing is something which can be consciously embraced all day long, and even during sleep.

Along with the breath, I find that feeling the heart-pulse is ideal. When my mind is disconnected, I am unable to feel the heart. As I am more and more integrated, I feel the heart-beat and its pulses and heat through the entire body. 

Yoga, tai-chi, dancing and other meditative practices of the body are beneficial aids if a person understands how to use them. The vibration of chanting, music and song as felt within the body are another way to connect to physical sensation.

As one maintains a constant awareness of the body sensation, the mind _must_ get quieter. And as the mind stills, one is able to be aware of who they are.

Consider, if you are able to observe it, then it is not you.

So, as one observes the sensations of the body, and then observes the action of the mind, and is able to observe so many things, what is it that remains unobservable?

Only yourself, quiet in the midst of the moving mind and flood of vibrations and bodily sensations, the relationship of you with yourself discovered through the relationship of the body and the mind.

"event","With any relationship involving ones self, another, or an aspect of life, there is a curve of interest and involvement. When it is new and special, the excitement drives involvement, and as interest wanes a persons interaction with that relationship becomes more and more habitual, and less conscious. Perceptions about the relationship begin to persist, and the new and wonderful can become second hand, boring and exhaustive. Where once one would run to be in and develop the relationship, without conscious nurturing one becomes just as happy to run from the relationship. 

The relationship itself is what it is. Yet, when things begin to become familiar, or problems develop, the common tendency is to blame the other person for what is going on. One tries to fix the relationship, or change the situation, or find new stimuli to remain excited. Observation and direct experience will reveal that all of these methods fail.

<lj-cut text=""The real solution remains in keeping a beginners mind, which consistently maintains the freshness of a relationship."">

First, let me clarify what I mean by relationship. Every aspect of life is in relation to our own self, the subject self has a relationship with the 'objects' of the world. Therefore, I can have relationships with other people in a variety of ways, or with nature, or ones environment and daily endeavors, and most importantly, with my own Self.

<i>As a relationship develops, a resistance to it will build due to familiarity.</i>

This is the big challenge for compassion and love. It is easy to say love, yet to love an intimate relationship when there are aspects to it that one dislikes, is a completely different story. One will speak love, and become disinterested, and will withdraw from actually being involved with the relationship. Then, the relationship becomes a ghost of love, clinging to a sweet past, yet having little to no fulfillment in the moment.

This is a process which occurs, a little every day. And sooner or later the relationship must come to an end. There simply is no energy in it, the energies have flowed elsewhere. Nurturing the relationship a little day by day causes the relationship to either grow, bud and flower if watered with appreciation, or to wither and fade if viewed with criticism and apathy. This is not action of word and thought, but of deed, and is the very seed of what either builds or destroys a relationship.

<b>Any relationship requires nurturing, not of words, but of action.</b>

In relationships, words become nearly meaningless in light of our moment-to-moment, day-to-day actions. The familiar words that ourself or another person may speak has absolutely no weight against the reality of observable action. We know the truth of our own eyes, and the hollowness of the words. When words and actions do not match, one is misaligned. This creates stress in the relationship that must eventually come back into balance.

Actions become the true language of relationship. Actions never occur tomorrow, and yesterday has already passed. Action only occurs now. If what is being done now does not nurture the important relationships, yet words of love and devotion are spoken, one is in disharmony. That person is living an untruth, often blinded by self-deception. It is easy to see this, yet the tendency is to deny the truth, and to speak in a defensive way which betrays trust and further diminishes the relationship.

<i>The other person or 'object' part of the relationship can never be held accountable for what one self feels in and about the relationship.</i>

Should the relationship start to wither, I can never point my finger at the other person or at the 'thing', and say that the fault rests there. The relationship is I, and when a relationship becomes misaligned, it is something within me that is causing the effect that I am noticing outside. 

When a person believes that it is the other, and attempts to change that person or thing, the stress that it creates automatically creates division due to the <i>actions</i> of attempting to change the other. Any stress eventually becomes released, often times resulting in pain and attempts to hide from such pain.

<b>When I recognize that I am solely responsible for my part in the relationship, then I am empowered to consciously act.</b>

<i>The relationship becomes liberating and is no longer held accountable for my own feelings about it. I am free to act in ways that can nurture whatever relationship I engage in, or to simply set aside relationships which are draining, freeing my energies to be effectively focused.</i>

Of course, the biggest factor in all relationships is perception. The held perception becomes the method of action. The perception that a relationship is boring and familiar leads to action that is sluggish and inattentive. Seeing the relationship as exciting and interesting, as one does naturally when it is new, brings tremendous growth and joy.

<b>Can the familiar and boring become exciting and interesting once again?</b>

The key is the beginners mind, approaching each moment as a new one, allowing the past to remain in the past and engaging in the relationship as it arrives now. This disentangles a person from their perceptions, and allows the freshness of the early relationship to remain ever present. The newness which is exciting is made available simply by looking at and appreciating what is already present.

<i>Just because a person or thing was one way in the past is no basis for judging that this is how it is now.</i>

Giving ones own self the freedom to be as I am grants freedom of action and thought right now, and allowing others and the relationship with them to be as it is unveils the subtle growths, minute changes, and distinctive nuances of that relationship to be made available.

<b>In essence, the relationship begins to go through a process of refinement, a distillation of perception where one remains in love with the essence of what was present at the beginning that is still here now, allowing the relationship to be what it is.</b>

Conscious involvement in a relationship allows enjoyment to unfold as the relationship develops. One becomes free of needing or demanding anything from the relationship, and simply appreciates and enjoys what is made available through the relationship. Where the actions of boring familiarity lead to neglect and a boring relationship, the actions which stem from appreciation effortlessly and naturally nurture the relationship, providing all the heart yearns for.

It's very easy to act for what we appreciate. The beginners mind has vision beyond the familiar mental-rut perception, and through awareness learns to appreciate the nuances and subtle aspects of the relationship.

The passion and excitement of the original moments may fade, yet a blossoming of real love and a true developing and deepening of any relationship becomes the moments unfolding of joy. One is fulfilled.

"event","I've been considering the meaning of enlightenment, and have a couple of personal observations.

Enlightenment is often:
<li>Pursued like a goal.
<li>Perceived as a thing achieved in the future after X hours of spiritual practice.
<li>Assumed to be complete liberation, no rebirths and a way to escape this 'horrible world'.
<li>Reserved for spiritual elists such as swami's, renunciates, lama's, monks.
<li>Something that occurs to personality / ego-mind.

In my perception, enlightenment is none of these things. Taken in such common context, enlightenment can never happen, it becomes relegated to myth just like heaven and hell, and is a waste of time to pursue. That said, enlightenment is possible, and has a variety of manifestations, and is more than a singular 'super-awakening' of the ego.

Enlightenment, in a yogic perspective, is mastery of the mind and its actions. This is freedom from the cyclical and unceasing mental patterns that creates the world of an individual and binds them to it. It is not freedom from day to day life and existence, escaping and transcending existence results in non-existence. One is simply free to respond without the fear and habitual patterns from the past.

<lj-cut text=""A person who is able to objectively observe mental machinations becomes liberated from circular tendencies of thought."">

This is accomplished through one singular methods: direct experience guided by intention. One must act right here and now in a way that fulfills the desired outcome. This brings enlightenment to the moment, where you do not 'act' enlightened, you simply learn to observe the mind and remove yourself from its tendencies of emotionalism & pessimism, doubt, guilt, & fears. Just as a solitary mystic renounces the world, the one who lives with action renounces the egoic properties of belies & judgment, choices of fear based on past experience and future projections.

One learns to remain in equanimity even in situations where the mind panics and vacillates between choices. Thus enlightenment becomes a moment to moment unfolding that grows through a deliberate process of self nurturing and relinquishing of painful patterns inflicted upon ones own self.

<b>The direct experience necessary for enlightenment can happen in infinite number of ways, in any place, at any time for every person.</b>

Contrary to popular belief, one is not required to live in a cave as a monk or swami while eating bugs and doing headstands in order to become enlightened. Enlightenment happens in every moment for every single individual, often times we are simply too busy to notice. The challenges for each person are unique, the key is to address life as it is, and to remain effortlessly centered. Any person can do this, it just depends on willfully persisting in order to discover what is beyond the limits of the time-bound, linear mind.

<b>There are several types of support in this process of self-inquiry. The most common is known as daily practice. </b>

Self-observation and an attitude of non-judgmental, choiceless awareness are aids to notice and unveil the quiet self within, even in the midst of any action. Though the technique is not the state of enlightenment, there are techniques of awareness which can be practiced at all times which assist the process.

It is unreasonable to remain silent in a chaotic day from the beginning of moving with the intention for enlightenment. One learns the techniques of consciousness during times of quiet and peace, where a relationship with the strong mind can develop without distraction. 

Daily practice happens in any number of forms, from yoga and breathwork, to tai-chi and martial arts, to journaling, meditating, walking, or playing instruments. The important part is to do what you can to come to a calm center. Discover and play with approaches that can be used all day long, so that each day becomes a fully conscious experience.

In time, the practice of the skill becomes secondary, and the relationship to the silent essence which emerges from within during such practice becomes the sole focus. Conscious control of breath is a key technique which can be used all day long, making it valuable to a person who is sincere in their self-unveilment.

Eventually the recognition viscerally arises within that the mind and its actions are not me. The limits of personality become less confining and one is able to enter a natural state of existence. Day to day life is just that, day to day life. One is liberated from the tyrannical mind and the personality. 

<b>The personality never can be enlightened, it can only be liberated from its own bondage of fear. The aspect which can be enlightened has always been present, is already present, and needs nothing done to be enlightened.</b> 

<i>At this point, enlightenment is recognized not a goal, it has become the enjoyment of each moment, even those that the ego would choose against. One catches continual glimpses of oneself, the mystery of I am which observes yet cannot be observed.</i>

<b>I would finish with another list, expressing that enlightenment is akin to:</b>
<li>Enjoying each moment as it arises, and is not pursued like a goal.
<li>Never occurs because of hard work, yet unveils itself through persistent dedication every day, never to be achieved in the future after X hours of spiritual practice.
<li>Liberation from mental tyranny, at which point it doesn't matter if you are reborn or not, of if you can escape this world and death.
<li>A practice of love which any individual can engage in day to day, moment to moment and is not something reserved only for spiritual elists such as swami's, renunciates, lama's, monks.
<li>Knowing the non-linear, boundless essential self which exists outside of the mind and is not something that can ever occur to personality / ego-mind.

"event","While often taken in a religious sense to lead stupid sheep to the slaughter, for me this phrase means:

<LI>Does a person act the truths felt within? Or do they simply have beliefs?
<li>Does one accumulate knowledge? Or does one test the truth of that knowledge by LIVING it day to day?
<LI>Does one silently bear witness to the results of their actions? Or does one simply sound knowledgeable, and attempt to share that knowledge with everybody?
<li>Does one simply believe in love & compassion? Or does one act with loving compassion?
<li>Is the magic in the mind? Or is the magic manifested most powerfully through action?
<LI>Does one allow the ego to remain in control? Or does one constantly and diligently observe egoic antics, and diminish it's stranglehold through skillful means?
<li>Does one just talk of god / religion / yoga / magick / juju / voodoo / spirituality / mojo? Or is one a living embodiment of the essential truth within?
<li>Does one prove their mind and belief? Or does one allow their actions to silently bear the power of the hearts conviction made manifest?
<li>Does one talk big & loud, doing little? Or does one silently conserve energy, and use that as fuel for energetic self-discovery?
<li>Does one allow shadow beliefs and fear to dominate their entire life? Or does one put to the test everything, and thus allowing fear to dissipate?
<li>Does one worship with their mouth and empty words? Or with their heart and silent deeds?

It's easy to 'buy' into a belief system, there are many eager recruiters who want the power, money and time of others. How many have taken efforts to dive into the core concepts of their beliefs? How many question, without choice for or against any belief or perception? How many want to be self-responsible and free? Not too many, in my opinion, most use all their time recruiting others to believe as they do on the theory that: if so many people believe it, it has to be true. There is no 'critical mass' of belief where something untrue magically becomes true.

Once a person buys into a belief, they often blindly devote their life to it, and defend it in so many stupid ways. This is obvious at the individual level, we can see it most easily in others, and on a global scale. Ignorance in action is stunning to observe.

Over a decade ago, I lost the belief in religion and a god-outside. As an entrepreneur I recognize that only those that 'do' are authentic and become successful. This last year I recognize spiritual beliefs mean nothing. Now, I see that the only knowledge worth knowing is always put to the test of action, and that faith which is untested is another name for 'fear-bound.'

Faith without action remains mere belief, a lodestone for the living dead. Belief that is untested shows a person who is unwilling to face their inner fears. People can talk incessantly about what they believe and never reach a common accord, yet those who know through experience can often communicate and discover balance with others. 

When experience learned through observed action becomes the mentor, all belief systems and perceptions of reality are dissolved in consciousness. Freedom unveils her nature.

"event","Magic formula, spells & incantations, mantras, songs and mystic diagrams; the students of mysticism and the occult love these things. It's neat, its interesting, they capture the attention and seem to be fulfilling. Delving into secret or sacred lore bestows a power of knowledge, and the illusion of power. Seeking answers from external sources is the first step of a novice.

The magicians grimoire with all of its formula and incantations is often studied for the knowledge which rests upon it's pages. And, while there may be useful information gleaned from such pages, the formula themselves are most often, absolutely useless. 

A person who would generate effects in the world is best guided by crafting their own grimoire, their own secret book of personal lore and knowledge, experience and insight. As the grimoire is crafted, through time it creates subconscious links, building energetic connections through intuitive understanding. The effects and impact of such a process is profound and always effective. And with dedicated focus and development of such a book, understanding, wisdom and the impact of such knowledge naturally grows and transcends any expectations.

Rote recitation of incantations lack in creativity, excitement, and may be deceptive by either the reader's lack of understanding and context for the original 'spells', or deliberately deceived by the grimoire crafter. Mathematical formula work because they are based upon universal laws which are immutable. To believe that magic & mysticism follow such laws is naive. While there are essential laws which are both obvious and obfuscated, and acting according to these laws bear fruit, the manipulation and control of these subtle forces can never be accomplished through mere magical-mathematical formula.

Interest and creativity are forces which attract and direct subtle energies much more effectively than mere thought. Inspiration and willpower have an intimate connection, both being fuel and the channel of energetic focus. While the study of anothers grimoire and techniques may have limited benefit, for long-lasting and enjoyable results, for a lifestyle practitioner who wishes to continuously unveil their innate potential, crafting a personal grimoire is absolutely essential.

"event","The feelings which generate thought have a non-mental language. This language is difficult to understand, and the mind has very little control over these feelings. These feelings are akin to energetic currents within the body, currents which operate according to cycles. A woman is attuned to these cycles for obvious reasons, men do not have blatant physical results of such currents.

This energy operates between two poles, positive and negative. Neither is good nor bad, yet the minds identification will label the negative polarity (sadness, depression, sickness, pain, entropy) of energy as bad and fights it. At the same time, mind enjoys the effects of positive polarity (happiness, joy, activity, pleasure) and will cling to it, trying to get more.

Yet, energy must flow according to its nature, swinging back and forth between the polarities of positive and negative. Neither polarity is right or wrong, they are just natural balances. The struggle to remain positive and to repulse negativity tends to create greater imbalance.

Consider the ocean and its tides, from high to low, it flows without choice. This also occurs within the physical body, yet the mind has the power to choose what it prefers and has aversions to. The natural tide of the ocean can be harnessed for great power through understanding its mechanism, so to can the natural energetic tides within the body be harnessed for great power.

Fighting the impact of the negative pole, labeling and identifying it as bad, wrong, evil or painful only prolongs the process. When energy is at the negative polarity it MUST swing back to a positive pole. And vice versa, from positive to negative.

The mind has a tendency to change and modify what it encounters, and it does so based on its experiences of the past. While the mind has dominion over the energetic body, the currents of biological energies are ultimately stronger than the mind, and are the very source of the minds thoughts and activities. 

To fight such an inner power is to squander that power, to ride the currents allows the polarities to naturally balance. Homeostatic equilibrium is maintained through non-attachment to the way either polarity feels and manifests. Equanimity within the polarity shifts is a process of awareness where one surrenders the need to feel certain ways, and the effects of those feelings.

One learns to be free of either energetic polarity, and can respond consciously and skillfully regardless of the feelings arising from within.

Distinctions:

<li>Feeling as the way a person feels, emotions as a reaction that stems from belief.
<li>Positive thought is incomplete, as positive thinking has limited effect when a persons feelings are deeper and contrary to the positive thinking.
<li>Feeling occurs before thought and is akin to biological energy.
<li>Thought can direct energy, yet has little power unless thought AND energy are in harmony.
<li>Fighting subtle feelings can be self-deceptive, truthfully facing darkened energies within can reveal a persons greatest treasures in life.
<li>Happiness, an emotion of having what one wants. Joy, a feeling of completeness regardless of circumstance.

"event","Love and Hate, Anger and Joy, Rage and Peace ... feelings which all have labels, yet no word ever comes close to describing the feeling. The feeling is what it is, the mind is always a step behind and gives it an identification as a certain 'thing.'

Yet feeling has a language which the mind is unable to completely understand. Yes, there is recognition of a feeling being present, yet the words always fall short. Consider the word love, and all the songs and poems, words and deeds that are used to describe love or act according to it. Love itself remains free of time-bound definitions.

This distinction of mental and feeling language is important to a seeker. One seeks until the feeling that one longs for is recognized as present. One searches until the language underneath words is visible and understood. One is possessed by longing until a shift is made from time-bound, linear, mechanical mental patterns to non-linear, intuitive and subtle realm of feeling.

No book can cause this paradigm shift, no preacher or teacher can reveal this Knowing place, no religion or god can save a person caught in the ceaseless cycles of a mind caught on a rodent's ever-spinning wheel, avoiding pain and seeking bliss.

Only by facing feeling, without choice for what is present and absent of identifications and labels, can this most important of bridges be built. Then, the mind recognizes its place in a existential hierarchy far more compelling than the bondage of its self-image, and one recognizes that the peace longed for has always been present.

"event","So many people use their lives trying to change things; their environment or relationships, jobs or home, thoughts and emotions, more money and better toys. Change occurs without one having to do anything about it, the efforts to force change waste energies and often does not address the reason which triggers the desire to have change.

Transformation only occurs when the subtle, unseen aspects to oneself are brought into awareness. In awareness, change occurs effortlessly without having to make it happen.

Then, instead of seeking happiness through entertainment and distraction, one is happy with what is. Rather than avoiding perceived pain, one allows the pain to exist absent the additional suffering that comes from resisting and forcing pain to go away. Instead of making change happens, one guides change as river-banks effortlessly direct a rivers flowing.

A freedom within becomes unveiled as the process of transformation unfolds, and the chains of action that hides from pain and manipulates pleasure to occur gradually slip away."

"event","There is no path which can work.

All religions fail, all spiritual teachings fall short, books are full of dead words, no teacher, preacher or guru can 'enlighten' or 'save' anybody, and every meditative, mystical and occult practice is incomplete. One turns to these sources only when they are disconnected from their personal internal source.

The only answer to human suffering rests at the level of the individual who is willing to go within, to intrepidly discover on their own the cause for their own suffering. Nobody and no-thing can do this for another person. This is an absolutely personal path which has no path, and there are rules to this game of inward exploration that has no rules. 

One must discover their own way and trust what comes from this journey.

There is no other way to discover lasting joy.

Trust in your self, and act accordingly.

<lj-cut text=""The original musing on this concept ..."">


At one time there was an intense longing within to discover my purpose in life, I felt incomplete, so I began to seek. As I sought, I looked at dozens of religions, played with occult and mystical practices, tried various meditative forms, and eventually came around to yoga. 

My discovery through yoga has been simple; I was insecure with a chaotic world and was looking for escapes of not having to live, to be with the day to day occurrences and relationships and inevitable pains of life. Most of all, I saw that by trying all these different paths that there was one path that was always with me that I'd never trusted, an intuitive, instinctual, effortless path which wells up from within. 

I'd never trusted that part of myself. I came to believe that somebody else could give me the answers I sought, that there was a 'way' to trick myself into feeling strong and secure.

Truth of the matter is, nobody else, no path, no religion, no spirituality, no technique, can ever work completely. All of these things are tools for one purpose: to get quiet and find out what is going on inside. 

Once you see what occurs within there is only one thing to do, explore your own self.

There are no books on this subject, no persons who can tell you what to do or how to be, no teacher who can teach one how to work with the subtle currents within, no religions that are able to bring a resolution to internal feelings, no techniques that can make the mind become quiet and clear.

Experience becomes the only reliable teacher. With experience, the self within is able to use all techniques or none at all to observe itself and grow. Through experience that which disturbs the inner peace can be brought to stillness. Having trust <I>in ones own self</i> becomes the only way of discovering that truth which is completely personal, a continual process of unveiling.

Therapists and counseling, medication and religion, distractions and 'having more' are today's common practices to knowing ones own self. In truth, these are all ways to bring a moments peace, and leaves a person without a chance of discovering the lasting stillness and understanding joy.

Happiness ... is there any person who doesn't want it ... is today's buzz-word excuse for self-gratification that gives permission to doing all kinds of things to 'get it.' Happiness can never be gotten, and it never lasts. Chasing it is a sure way to bring about suffering.

The joy which comes from being balanced with the pains and pleasures of life is only available to the person who stops trying to be happy, and who instead travels inward to directly address completely personal secrets and feelings.

One becomes a cosmonaut of pain and despair, an explorer of internal entropy, and learns to be a mediator of personal and external realities. Only by facing the suffering inflicted upon one's own self is freedom discovered, and then pain loses its bite, and fear dissolves like a banished spirit."

"event","The spiritual quest to transcend is a bit of a paradoxical joke. Each person is already transcended, else there would be no sense of awareness. The big quest has nothing to do with removing the 'ego' or destroying any part of ones own being.

Everybody is OK, and are right where they need to be. And everything is OK, and as it should be. Including my reactions and rejection of 'what is', because that is still a part of 'what is.'

<B>So what is Spiritual Holier Than Thou?

All the bullshit that comes from 'spiritual' thought about how people should or should not be.
</B>
<I>Similar to xtians who are morality police for one another, people involved in 'spirituality' seem to act as 'ego' police.</I>

Common phrases used in a 'spiritual' community:

<LI>Thats just your ego talking.
<LI>You are buying into your ego's perspective. (duh)
<LI>You should breathe deep and let go.
<LI>You shouldn't be reactive.
<LI>You are labeling *X* and reacting to it.
<LI>You don't do enough practices.
<LI>You are attached to A, B, or C and blah blah blah.
<LI>Because I do X Y or Z, and you don't do X Y or Z, then I am 'spiritual.'
<LI>Because I am spiritual, you have to listen to me.
<LI>Thats the way it is because I say so, and because you can't see it you aren't spiritual.
<LI> ... and many many many many more. It's non-stop.

Often couched as 'helpful' phrases, spiritual comments are manipulative in a most insidious way because they:
A, are said in a I Know Better Than You manner,
B, can be damaging to the person it is being spoken to,
C, implies that the other person is not being how they should be according to a greater plan than the little self can recognize.
D, implies that the other person is 'broken' and has to be 'fixed' ... which is separative and damaging.

My response?
<font size=+5>
KISS MY LITTLE REACTIVE MORTAL ASS
</font>

<I>
PS, I apologize to the universe, and the people in it, who I have inflicted this type of stupidity upon. Having recognized it for the non-sense that it is, I no longer do this.

"event","I admit ... I'm a creature of habit. Some habits, Ive tried to get rid of, others that I wished to have kept around faded.

So, one of my favorite habits has been picked up again ... journaling with pen and paper.

See ... the most interesting thing I learned by going through advanced yoga training last week is this ... I already know advanced yoga, yet had doubted myself. The relationships I had kept years ago supported my own doubt and fear, and coming out of an incredible cloud of negativity has been a process of uncertainty encouraged by amazing results.

<i>Being self-sufficient, absent of anger and fear or the need to prove anything to anybody or needing other people or the world to be any way other than as it is provides an incredible feeling of relaxation. All that life has to offer becomes much more enjoyable.</i> 

And when I say yoga, I mean living and being myself. Not being 'spiritual' or 'enlightened' or 'worship the white light.' I really am not a devotee to emotionalism, I am a devotee to right Knowledge, Experience and Truth.

Through the context of advanced training that I was able to make connections for myself, seeing for the first time that which was already under my nose.

Doubt and hesitation are stumbling blocks that can be devastating. 

Journaling is a way to appreciate the inner nature, and nurture ones own spirit. To step past internal barriers and resistances, to become comfortable with and to recognize that which already abides within.

One can be absolutely creative and ... PLAY in anyway that comes up. This breaks the barriers of inertia, and enables a person to recognize their subtle talents which may not be readily visible in the busy-ness of day to day life.

As I've gotten back into journaling I've faced personal concepts about how to journal, or what to journal about. I had an 'art' journal, a 'dream' journal, a 'thoughts' journal, a 'idea' journal ... and so ... I just got one big journal and make it the 'everything' journal. 

Each day, I start a new page. It's very important to use a journal every day.

What I put on the page ...

Anything and everything.

Doodles and drawings ...
ideas and dreams ...
intentions and affirmations ...
What I am Grateful For Each Day (This is really important) ...
philosophies and jokes ...
yoga and magicka ...
observations and whatever else comes around.

So, why am I taking the time to write all of this here?

Journaling is important, it nurtures the inner genius of every human. It's helping me reconnect to much which was forgotten, its an enriching process which has immense, not-imaginable benefits. I completely believe that anybody who engages in this process will also become fascinated by what they encounter and unfold through it.

Keeping a journal is the most traditional trait of genius, both of intellect and creativity. It's a way to keep the creative juices flowing, to make subconscious connections, and to inspire oneself to develop in their own unique, individual way.

Writing and drawing on a consistent basis guarantees that creative ideas and 'Ah-Hah' connections will develop. It's a nurturing process that is enjoyable to engage in, and its important to do it in the way that comes natural to each individual.

Nurture your divine genius.

<i>The Practical Aspect</i>
I recommend getting an artists drawing book from an art store with unlined 60 lb + paper. Use a pen, and if you use a pencil, write over what you want to keep long-term with a pen. Pencils smudge and become illegible. Be deliberately messy, observe self-concepts of how this 'should be' and then play with doing it differently than those self-imposed limits dictate.

After all, while external dictators may take a persons life, the internal dictator ruins every aspect of life in every moment. We all need a way to play and express in ways that are not inhibited. Journaling becomes an expression of joy that then spreads to other areas of life.

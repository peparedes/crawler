"event","Halo 3 everywhere at work today, can't comment on gameplay, but fuck, the gfx are pretty f'ing disappointing. Not only does the game literally look like just a hires halo 1 xbox, but the the claims of it being 60fps are wack. 
Okay, so the title screens, and some cut scenes are 60, oh and wait for about the first few seconds of the first level it's 60, but then it's quickly 30 and stays that way. There might be an occasional burst of 60, but really, it's just 30. 
When bungie claimed the game would be 1080p 60fps I figured well at least there's a [lame] excuse for it looking like halo 1, render 2.5x as many pixels at 2x the framerate.... oh but wait, actually it doesn't even render at 1080p, it only renders at 720p like every other xbox game and scales up [for those few people who actually have an HDTV that can do 1080p res]. 
Oh, and apparently it also does not have antialiasing either. 
WTF
If Bungie had actually hired me fulltime to do shaders instead of just letting my contract expire I could've done something about it, but oh thank god they didn't coz that means I'd be working for Microsoft in Amerikkka.

Ok, that's my dorky gamer rant for the year, I've got better things to do than ""bask in the glow of the magic that is Halo3"" like, clean the house..."

"event","From an online review of a restaurant we ordered pizza late night from...<b> <br /></b><i><b><br />Food used to be outstanding.</b><br />When I didnt walk in to eat, I'd order a late night delivery since they were opened til 3am or later. One time, for a late night delivery around 3am (a number of yrs back), the boss did it himself! He's such a considerate fellow, though it only happened once, he was waiting at the front door with the delivery as he dialed my number to let me know of the arrival! So kind, especially since he probably noticed the lights to the house was out for the most part, since I was at the back of the house, he may have noticed light in the basement down the side. So he asked if he should be at the front or back. :) It was so nice of him not to have rung the doorbell or bang on the door since there were others asleep in the house, just that I didn't actually make any special requests when I placed the order--I just expected a doorbell + banging that delivery guys tend to love doing.<br /></i><br />We expected that to end with the pizza guy just finding an unlocked door, and walking in to drop off the pizza with guy who lives there unaware cause the pizza guy is, you know, just trying to be convenient and helpful in a really creepy sort of way. Stalker Pizza.<br /><br />Then after creepy pizza leaves the guys all like ""This pizza is FUCKING cold, and it doesn't taste good AT ALL..... ~&nbsp; AT ALL!.""<br /><br />Maybe it would be Trudy Waggle from Reno 911 or something....<br />"

"event","So coming home yesterday, I got a 3 from main & terminal. As I looking for a seat on the bus this Sikh guy who doesn't seem to speak much english like waves at me after I sit down, like he knows me or something. I have no recollection of this guy. He's sitting in the aisle in front of me and is trying to say something but none of it is intelligible.
I ask him if we've met before and he either isn't talking english or his accent is too thick to make out anything. Ask him again, useless. He keeps gesturing for me to come up and sit next to him, I have no intention of doing so. Eventually he holds up his hands and rubs his fingers together representing money. 
I think ""no fucking way, this guy does not meet what I think he does"".
Next thing he says is ""how much? 10 dollar, i like"". OKAAY....
Right, not only am I filthy whore who'll sleep with anyone, but I'll do it for 10 freaking dollar man!! Maybe I cut you discount. WTF. Someone must have told this guy ""yo, go to vancouver, every girl you see on main street will slide your glide for chump change.""

Very few things actually offend me, this was one of them. Yet another chapter in the ""Vancouver Experience""

"event","mostly just posting cause I had to change to the cute kitty theme, although I can't seem to change the width of the box for displaying my entries, which should totally be wider. Anyone know if I can make it wider with this theme?
Anywayz, FF7 AC is just so dope through a projector, as are Doom3 and Half Life 2, yum. Not that I ever manage the time to play for more than like 5 minutes. Need to get a VGA adapter for our Gamecube so we can finish Crystal Chronicles, as it supports progressive scan.

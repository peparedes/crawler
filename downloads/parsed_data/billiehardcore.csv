"event","its the first day of March and oh man, do i feel like a million bucks.

yesterday i visited UCO for a bit and got horribly lost, but with the help of a modern beatnik passerby i made it to the perspective student services office by exactly 5pm on the last day of the deadline to turn in scholarship applications. after all that excitement i came home and cleaned my room. okay, so thats not such an accomplishment but if you knew me youd know it is something to be extremely proud of.
today i worked my ass off from the moment i woke up until now to clean my room, go shopping, work on future college stuff and in general get my butt in gear. now my best friend is heating up pizza in my kitchen. she came over armed with Romy and Michelles High School Reunion, Power Puff coloring books and a smile.

its definitely the little things that make this thing so good."

"event","i went to go see Lord of the Rings (or as my friends call it, ""LOTR"") tonight with Scott and Carrie and it was good and stuff, although im not like a big LOTR fan or anything. one thing i came out thinking about though is how it worries me that a movie like that is coming out during the current political climate. in fantasy movies, good and evil is usually for the most part very clearly laid out. Lord of the Rings is no exception. yes, there are characters who sit on the good/evil fence, but the theme is clear- theres good and theres evil, and its very stereotypically obvious who falls where. the good guys wear light-colored clothing, are white, are often bathed in white light, and find inspiration in the sunbeams. the bad guys are ugly dark-colored demons with blood and guts dripping from their mouths. 

so while i get that there are strong pacifist/ecological themes in the movie, and while i am totally against censorship, i feel like this movie is going to fuel a lot of pro-war/violence rhetoric just because of how simplistic the good/evil dynamic is and how RACIST the portrayal of that is. at one point in the movie a band of bad guys ride in on elephants wearing clothes that could definitely be construed as what white western people think of as being stereotypically ""arab"" or ""muslim"". i cant explain it exactly, but it was extremely fucked up and it definitely seemed to be intentional- not necessarily put there to incite violence or hatred, but there was definite clothing appropriation or whatever on some level. and, of course, all those bad guys all get killed by the Good White Men. what does that say? how many stupid americans are going to make that connection and think, ""hey! we in america are like the good guys, and the iraqis are the bad guys!""? how much are the fucked up, racist dynamics in Lord of the Rings going to affect people's attitudes about war? its just something im throwing out there. i dont mean to make it sound like im demonizing people who like lord of the rings; i think its just about how we need to be constantly critical of the things we love."

"event","i just left a comment to Keith about how i have no desire to talk/hangout with most people lately. anyone else noticing a trend with this?
maybe its because the weather fooled me into thinking it was spring last week so i got all warm and excited, then this week its been cold and iced the oher day ago and its too much to deal with so i hide out under the covers molesting the friends who come by and completely forget about making any new ones. that would take an effort im not willing to put out right now.
so ill wait around for the opportunity to jump out and find spring weather again. then energy will melt back into my bones and i wont mind the countless hours i sit in front of my gray screen computer hitting the refresh button on friends page.

i watched Clerks last night with people who havent ever heard of Kevin Smith, let alone watch the series of movies, now i think ive helped develop chapter 11 division of Oklahoma ViewAskew fans.
heh. or something.
also watched Pulp Fiction, another movie i havent seen in forever.

"event","you know, the more i think about it, the more i'm sick of hearing people talk about how they're opposed to voting, or how they exercise their right NOT to vote. i mean, whatever, you can do what you want, but why throw it in the face of those of us who vote for whatever candidates because we really and truly have no other choice? and why not acknowledge that you have the privilege to decide not to vote in the first place?

let's make an analogy of voting choices amongst people on the left to food purchases here. some people don't have to make choices about what kind of food they eat because they live with their parents and get free food. they say things like, ""well, *I'D* never buy that cheap 33-cent can of peas! that is nasty and bad for you!"" or ""ugh, *I'D* never spend so much on expensive organic peas!"" when it's like, well of course not, you get your food for free no matter what so you are making a really uneducated decision. then there are the people who buy and eat the cheap peas because they have no other options, or because it's the most cost-efficient choice for them or because they feel like it's a better bargain. there are also the people who weigh the plusses and minuses of buying more expensive, organic peas and buy that instead.

okay so yeah my analogy is weird, but if you can't figure it out the people who are judgemental about the food buyers are the non-voter types, the people who buy the cheap peas are the democrat voters, and the people who buy the organic peas are the green voters. staunch non-voters exercise their right not to vote, which is their choice, but it irritates me that people think they need to flaunt that or something. i vote because in the end, some things are not ""all the same"". if i vote democrat vs voting republican, there's going to be policy differences on things like abortion and the embargo on cuba and war and welfare- the things that affect my life and my family's life and the lives of people i care about. i might not get the end result that i want, but there's going to be a positive difference of some sort- especially when i think about the fact that whatever party controls the senate and the house decides what issues to put forth on the agenda (i.e. the democrats might put a gay marriage bill on the floor, while the republicans will put another stupid law that will make it harder to get abortions). on the other hand, if i vote green (or for another third party) vs. voting democrat, i am putting my ideals and the things i really believe in before choosing the lesser of two evils. i am also sending a message out to the democrats that says ""hi! i'm over here on the left! since you aren't paying enough attention to me, you're losing my vote! GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!"" both decisions are noble decisions, and both are motivated by one key instinct- survival. i want to survive. i want to see my friends who are on welfare be able to feed their kids. i want to see my EXgirlfriend's homeland free from an oppressive embargo. i want to be able to exercise my right to choose. i want to show the democrats that they need to tighten up and get their act right. and yeah it's only one vote and yeah it's not the be all end all to what i want my coutnry to be like, but it's still MY VOICE and it's still SOME TINY CHANGE and THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS. when people talk about being anarchists and not supporting the fucked-up party system and ""democracy"" we live under by voting, i hear them but at the same time i don't think they're speaking from a standpoint of NECESSITY. it makes me mad that someone's political stance in the end really and truly says nothing. if you decide not to vote for political reasons, do you stand at polling places holding signs that says ""i don't vote because i don't want to support this shit""? do you hold rallies on election day to get your point across? if you're just NOT VOTING and that's it, then what the hell are you doing that day that's positive? what are you doing to get your voice out there since you opted not to vote? what kind of activist are you really? i have never met a single anti-voter that has done anything practical or positive on election day. not a one.

so yeah, that's why i am fucking sick of it all. i HAVE to vote, and i have to strategize about the way i do it. if i'm voting in a presidential election, i have to figure out if i'm in a swing state or not. if i'm not, i vote green. if i am, i have to weigh the pros and cons of voting either way. if i'm voting in a state or local election, i have to do the same shit. i have to do this because if i don't make the right choice, my southern neighbor in mississippi will have less government cheese to feed her kids, all the poor and ignorant women i know won't be able to get abortions because they don't know all the COOL HERBAL STUFF that anarchist ladies do, and my latina girlfriend is going to get harrassed and discriminated against even more than she already does. and YEAH, the fact that i have to make this choice fucking SUCKS, but isn't it much more practical for me to just go ahead and vote for one hour a year and then spend the rest of the time doing the same grassroots organizing that i've always done, rather than doing the same thing that lazy slacker-types do?"

And when I tired to turn away, clamping my hands tightly to my ears so that I couldn't hear, she would crawl inside and speak to me form there. You can't shut yourself out.

She poured me coffee in the morning, and laced it with powder that would harden my stomach and make me sick.

""So, now that you have taken away my pleasures, "" I said to her, ""you are here to cause me pain?""

""What's pleasure without pain, and pain without pleasure? You cannot have one without the other."" She smiled.

""But I cannot stand this, "" I begged, ""I Don't know how much longer I can hold on.""

But she persisted. Riding next to me in the car, her fingers intertwined with mine, as much as I tried to pull away. Walking behind me, like a shadow, like someone walking a dog, her grip on my leash tight.

And sometimes she would stroke my cheeck, pulling tears down from my eyes, encouraging every one to stain thier salty impressions, painting my cheeks bright red. And I let her, because sometimes, it was a wonderful release, and she didn't know it.

Sometimes it was what I needed, and oh, I needed it very much. To release a tension that once took on a sweeter form.

""You ask too much of me, "" I told her once. I half expected the laugh, but flinched at the arms, wrapping themselves around me in an unwanted hug.

""I only take what you can afford"", she replied. I knew what she said was true, but i felt as if she were still taking far too much.

And some nights she was rentless. Some nights, even as tightly as I shut my eyes, as hard as I held my hands against my ears, and as loudly as I cried out, her voice still came though to me.

""Please, lay somewhere else, "" I urged. But you cannot push sorrow to the foot of the bed. You can't slip her like a second skin, as much as you'd like. As much as you ache.

But sometimes relief would come, her voice would quiet to a whisper, and exhaustion would soothe me to sleep.

Her grip is loosening, but only slightly. She knows when to speak to me, when to reclaim my hand in hers.

Sometimes she's large with all the force and fury of a hurricane, sweeping in on me. Or the tiniest thing, like a small bird perched on my shoulder.

       And my bird does sing."

"event","Dear god, I am just SO seriously tired of people right now. 
I can, honestly, think of 3 people who do NOT like me at all. 2 are EXbestfriends and the other is the now bestfriend of one of the EXbestfriends...if that made any sense in a terribly high school sort of way.

My life is a walking, talking, breathing episode of My So-Called Life. I kid you not.

Even though in reality these 3 people are NOTHING compared to the oodles of people who do like me and think I rock the casbah, it is SO HARD not to let them overshadow the goodness of my life. It seems like every corner I turn one of these people are there saying horrible things about me or otherwise infiltrating my life in some way.

I'd like to think that a lot of this gets better once High School ends. I may be forming one hell of a naive illusion with that, but its quite simply the only thing that is keeping me from giving up all hope. 
you change. friends backstab. trust is for losers. love sucks. and the people you love...they die.
It's difficult to keep the happy things in your mind with all of this to keep you occupied.

Reality bites....

Sitting on the edge of your bed
it feels like the edge of the world
and I wonder if it would disturb you
if I plummeted off the side.

I can hear
your breathing behind me,
but I don't know
if the distance between us
should be measured in
centimeters or light years
when I notice
the darkened doorway.

I fear doors that are left
unclosed; they threatened
to swallow
       me
           up
but glued to my spot
I will not rise to shut it
or fear of disturbing you."

"event","i stayed in from school today. yeap. totally recooporation time from this weekend.
this weekend which sucked my left donkey nut.
grrrr.

deadline for 6 photo spreads was due friday night so i was stuck in the darkroom from 2:10-11:30pm. i took a shower to wash all the chemicalyness away then went to Andrews to party. he got drunk and cried about his best friend Mitch who died of a crank overdose about 18months ago. note to self: newports SUCK
saturday Casey Lee, Moses, and i went to Amanda Ps for a post-halloween party and met cheech and chong, along with about 5 ""goth kids"" and paper-bag-over-the-head boy. me? i was supa fly normal kid as always. 
hardy har har.
we made a taco bell run at 2am and i got in the backseat with 2 guys. long story short - i was involentarily molested by one of the guys. Moses came back to the car and saw blood on the front of my shirt and beat the guy up in the parking lot. i cried and casey lee held me in the bathroom and tried to force feed me a taco for comfort. later that night casey ends up sleeping with some random guy (i think it was cheech?), moses and i get pissed off and sit in the car until 6:30am when casey gets done and we leave.
i go to work from 8am-6pm (yes, im DEAD at this point). during this time one of the guys working there breaks into my car, steals my wallet, cellphone, and 2 CDs, then throws the wallet back into the front seat of my car. dumbass. i confront him about it and end up kicking some ass. get sent home early. i filed a police report. disconnect my phone. he's back in juvy. 
back home again to sleep.

so today you can see why i took the day off from school. horrah!
lessons learned: 
1. dont get fucked up
2. find new kids to hang around"

"event","You have your people classifications. 

Theres the Zodiac, and psychoanalysis, and generation labels. Theres a thousand classifications and generalizations and population lists and political genres, and they build upon each other until a Sagittarius-Environment-Affected-Quasi-Feministic-Activest clutches her head in agony and flees to Blockbuster. perhaps a movie will break the monotony. 

But then you have your movies. 

Ah, the joy of renting movies - sauntering down the organized rows, popping down to the bottom shelf and back up to the top like some bizarre prairie dog dream. 

<i>""Ohmigosh, I love this movie!""</i>

<i>""You do?""</i> comes the inevitable response, always pitched at some disdainful decibel. And thus the wandering and the prairie dog dream become a vast American nightmare. Comedies arent funny. Action flicks arent exciting. Horror movies are funny. Sci-fi movies are predictable. And chick flicks are usually reserved for parties of one-plus-cat. 

I confess: I like a good chick flick. Thats because Im a girl and Im allowed. I wonder if there are chick flick guys out there. If they wear dark clothing and creep stealthily into the video store. Maybe they hide out in the suspense section for a few minutes, heads down, every now and then peering out over the stacks, scooping out the general terrain. Suddenly the moment arrives! They dash for the foreign films! Theyre going . . . going . . . wait, theyre stopping!<b> HOMIES AT 2 O'CLOCK! ABORT! ABORT!! </b>Think fast - they have a choice of <u>Skin Tight</u> or <u>Gore Fest 69</u>. They pick the <u>Gore Fest</u>. Wouldnt want anybody to think theyre weird or anything. 

And then theres the sci-fi flick. I recall <U>Fifth Element</u>, during which I commented to my sci-fi companion, <i>""is that Gary Oldman or just a really bad imitation?""</i> - a line that sparks memories of random phone calls thereafter: <i>""Do you have Gary in a can?"" </i>The sci-fi movie is usually innovative but the sci-fi rental is difficult to carry off, due to the fact that most sci-fi movies take themselves far too seriously. I speak of <u>The Fifth Element</u>, which was an impressive experience of random nonsense, world doom and orange hair, and after which this humble viewer wailed,<i> ""What was Gary Oldman thinking!?""</i>  I believe that <u>The 5th Element</u> bordered on incredibly sweet -- if only it had been filmed as techno-comedy-drama instead of half-sci-fi.  

After sci-fi we must mention the realm of action-suspense. The first movie of this genre I can think of is <u>Bourne Identity</u>. Youve got your government corruption and your required body count, and then youve got Matt Damon. (Theres that girl factor again, my apologies) The trouble with suspense movies is the lack of humor. Somehow the viewer always emerges with a glassy stare and a shifty eye. Is that guy over there really blind or is he an agent for The Evil Wing of the FBI? 

I cant say the horror flick genre appeals to me, Can you honestly say that they pull off their purpose? In case someone has forgotten, it is to SCARE. Having never relished the sheer joy of blood, I say label all horror under their true name ""Suspense w/ Blood"". There IS something appealing in watching a good black and white Vampire movie. It has that certain je ne sais quoi, that certain gimmick of Billie-made-us-rent-this-one. It-lacks-real-blood. If you like horror movies, more power to you. You sick twisted loser. 

Youve got your comedies too. Some are funny and some are not and most of the time the funny parts strike people in different ways. Sometimes one person laughs. And sometimes nobody laughs. While interviewing a certain acquaintance upon this subject, she declared, <i>""The trouble with comedies is that they arent funny""</i>, which makes me realize two things: one, not everyone finds the same stuff funny, and two, my acquaintances rarely reply to an interview in a deeply profound way. 

Old movies, at least once one establishes the date that a movie becomes old (sometimes it means last month), are always interesting because you get to hear everyones opinion on black and white film. What does this nations youth have against black and white? What has color ever REALLY done for them? There is a deep hatred for gray in this country. Upon noticing this trend I decided to purchase a gray shirt in hopes of discovering the problem. My shopping chum gave the thumbs up on the shirt, and I bought it. So far have gotten no comments except those from my mother, who wondered why I shelled out twenty bucks for a shirt. Of course she doesnt understand that research has its price. 

Are we doomed to forever suffer the wrath of the video rental? My research, vast and extensive though it was, seems to prove yes. But perhaps thats half the fun of renting a movie. Especially if youre a girl who can look very sad and helpless when she doesnt get her chick flick . . . or who has the decency to compromise on an 'suspense with blood' thriller. 

If anyone out there knows any chick flick guys, I hope some kind soul will let them know that a certain Sagittarius-Environment-Affected-Quasi-Feministic-Activest is looking for them. Tell them Ill be at Blockbuster, prairie-dogging amongst the shelves."

and i spend a majority wishing i was asleep, or dead, or cutting. of course its not cold enough to wear long sleeves in the afternoons, but i can get by wearing jackets everyday because no one <i>really</i> notices anyway. 

after this friday i think im going to stop seeing Dr. Glass. he reminds me too much of my father; he makes me feel dumb in every session and wants me to talk about things im not ready too yet. in addition to this, hes also trying to prove he can connect with me by saying things like, he can certainly understand yadda yadda because he was there himself yadda yadda,.....as if i really fucking cared. yea right.

oh god, i dont know. I DONT KNOW. i feel like laying in a pile of blankets with a 2litter of dr pepper, watching reruns of My So-Called Life and thinking how that show embodies my life as a teenager. i wish we could clone Angela and Rayanne into younger versions of themselves and continue making episodes until i croak one day at 75. of course ill always have a place in my heart for the MSCL kids. i couldnt have made it through the battlefield of high school without them."

"event","for lunch i went out to eat at this little chinese restaurant thats become one of my favorite places (it is SO hard to find a good chinese restaurant with a good buffet!) so i was overjoyed when i tried it and it lived up to my expectations. 

its horrible the way i judge chinese restaurants. if they offer sweet and sour pork and not chicken, i hate it. if their sweet & sour chicken suck, i hate it. i wont go back. S&S chicken are one of my FAVORITE foods on the face of the earth and having nice, warm, very plump little chicken strips is a must. 

so now every chance i get, i hit Scott and Carrie up to take me there. we're standing in line and im piling on the sweet and sour chicken, fried bread, etc, and i look over at the chinese lady standing behind me. it was so funny! okay, i know she was trying to be helpful, just asking us to try this and that, and actually holding a big serving out to us (remember that a buffet meaning self-serve)...she points to fish, which is another thing i wont touch, and i shake my head and say no thank you. then she points to some weird concoction that looked like a sort of cheeseball with rice all over it. 

the reason i cant eat fish is not because i dont like it, but I CANT eat it. if its there, my mind automatically has this little trigger inside of it that screams 
""NO NO! Don't Touch! FISH = DEATH!"" in my minds eye, i see the fish squiggling around, leaving a trail of slimy goo like that of a slug. i actually have to shut my eyes when im watching someone eat fish. yes, its THAT bad.

so i shook my head more vehemently and tried to scurry to the other side of the buffet where the lady couldnt reach my plate and try to shove the big flaming ball of death onto it, but i feel bad (she looked personally offended that i wouldnt take one) and she actually follows me down the buffet and, horror of all horrors, i find myself standing in front of the tofu dish.

this might sound odd, but ive never seen it before. ive heard of it, in that ""eat healthy, eat tofu"" kind of way, but ive never seen it, and i never have pinpointed what the hell is actually in it. so i go ahead and nod and decide im going to be adventurous and try it out.

we get back to the table and i cut the square in half and look inside. it looks rather suspicious, kind of like lobster meat but not really, and i already know im not going to like it. so i cut off a little piece, smell it, touch it, try to do everything humanly possible to make sure this isnt going to make me vomit...

and put it in my mouth.........

<b>BIG FUCKING MISTAKE!!!! </b>

i felt like i was chewing a rubber fish. i couldnt chew it up! i couldnt get it to dissolve so i could swallow it, so i kept chewing, and chewing, and the more i was chewing the stronger my gag reflex was getting. i picked up my napkin and was actually planning on spitting it out before i HURL all over the damn table and Scott's sitting over there laughing his ass off at me, and when i lift the napkin to my lips ----
the waiter stops and asks us how everything is. i stop chewing. i can feel my stomach churning violently. i prayed silently that he'd hurry up and leave before i make a complete ass out of myself. i actually have to close my eyes and breathe through my nose to keep from vomiting.

he finally leaves and Scott suggests swallowing it whole, like a pill.
oh dear god.
i grab my Dr Pepper and it wont go down...Oh my GOD it wont go down..its too big! im going to choke and Scott's going to have to do the Hiemlich Maneuver on me and this big chunk of half chewed tofu is going to come rocketing out of my mouth!

i chew it up finally and swallow it. at this point, my appetite is entirely gone and im left sitting there like someone who is violently ill, kneeling over the toilet and trying to breathe, thinking that any moment youre going to toss again.

if this is what is going to happen to me when i try something new with no prior knowledge to what the HELL it is, i solemnly vow that im going to be the most boring, uninteresting food test taster that ever lived."

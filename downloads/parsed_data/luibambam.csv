Are you kidding me?

I just saw this video and instantly recognized the tracks that I had for so long has been from this video. What is this place called, 'Arlene Grocery'?, Unreal. 

Well, the question is, what ever happened?

I'm still having difficulty calling these five guys 'The Strokes', seeing that everyone of them were dancing their fucking hearts out. And Jules as Mr. Energy is taking a lot of getting used to. He's so contagious, he even made the usually stoic Nikolai dance and move around. Also, I love Nick's jeans -- first time I saw him without his skinnies. I also love the fact that he was the one singing in 'Sagganuts'. I dunno why I thought it was just some random dude in the recording.

Yeah, why did these guys lose their energy? I dunno. A witty comment made me laugh as I read it, it says something like, 'This was before 9/11, were these guys depressed because of the War on Terror?'. Haha, i cannot fathom that, but that's a good theory.

Anyway, that was a good video, I kinda forwarded through some parts, but I loved it. Great to see stuff like these available to us.

PS. After the performance, Nick was still standing on stage in the rubble. I think he was looking for his glass of beer. I saw him put it below Fab's bass drum, but after the last song Fab kicked his drums, probably crushing the glass. That was quite funny."

Half-intoxicated, you're mine to gain
But please understand, I'm yours to lose

Why is me and you so unthinkable?
I know you've loved them another
You tell your stories and I've listened
But what is this about me being a brother

I don't need you to like me at all
I honestly don't see you as a venture
But when you look at me and I stare
I feel something I'll deny in the future

And forget your lingering insecurities
Love is a friend in its direst need
No way to verify authenticity"

As he walks with his head down
Trying to stand up straight
Trying to fix is stubborn hair

He thinks to himself,
""What is it that I lack""
""Why do I feel empty""
""Why do I feel unloved""

He walks through the blowing wind
His jacket flapping at his sides
He slightly gazes on passerbys
And then slowly stares at the sky

He scribbles a thought in his mind
Every pen stroke embedded in his brain
He dreams of a lover he can dissapoint
He dreams of friends who play instruments

He dreams of a band he could play lead
He dreams of songs he can play
He dreams of guitars that can speak
Of every feeling words cannot express

Sinister smiles greet the mainstay
As he walks in the room
He can't understand why he's alone
When people seem to be oh-so-friendly"

"event","Last night after a long day of badmintoning, smoking, Xbox-360ing (which I definitely wanna have), and telling stories, I was supposed to take my sister home from Katipunan. We were about to leave when I suddendly shared that I wanted to drink. We sat with a bunch of her friends, and because I really wanted to drink, I went in a drinking spree for about an hour, about 5-6 beers. At that point I couldn't remember that my dinner was a little hamburger at 6:30 PM.

So to keep a long story short I was damn drunk at once. It must have been a personal record. nIt's important for guys that you hold it together, I did most of the time, but I got drunk relatively fast yesternight. But that's not all.

We went to Something Fishy for the buffet, and I couldn't eat so I slept while they were eating. And I puked outside the place (it was mostly water and acid, no food) to an audience of about 30 people trying to enjoy their buffet.

As I woke up a moment ago, all the shame is starting to get to me. But I wrote it here to serve as a reminder: PACE YOUR DRINKING ASSHOLE!

Oh, the shame."

Well, I liked the movie. Bond was, well, different. And the new Bond's acting skills could use more work, but that's why I like him, and the movie to come along with it. Unorthodox is the only word I can think of right now to perfectly describe my critique. 

I love the fact that he fell in love. I love the fact that he made the password to the bank account 'Vesper', or the girl's name, just as we did when we were high school students infatuated with a certain someone.

I love the fact that he ached after every kill he made, and the he felt the pang of conscience when he was partly responsible for the death of a girl. I love the fact that he fell in love (I think I said this before) when every Bond that ever was always had this weird non-commital understanding with their leading ladies, and in that clause non-commital sex is also included. But that's just for the leading ladies. Imagine how emotionally wrecked the side propgirls are after Bond finishes screwing them to oblivion, only to speed away afterwards on his fancy Aston Martin.

I love the fact that he quit the MI6 just for Vesper. Just to be happy.

I love the fact that, even wronged, he tried to rescue Vesper. He still loved her.

I love the fact that he builds a wall and goes into obviously shaky denial stages after the parting. Yeah, that's what humans feel and do. So even Bond should. ""Why do I need more time?"" remarked Bond after an inquiry from M, ""The bitch is dead"" he claimed.

Well, along with Vesper drowned your humanity James Bond."

"event","Well, in a Wednesday that I thought would have me doing something other than the internet and music, well, I was wrong. I am currently writing in my LJ.

Well, I was supposed to watch PBA today, again after a very long time. Well, my friends ditched me for DOTA, which I do not play, but I'm cool with that. Well, yeah it sucks, but that's a done deal anyway. Now I ponder what to do. Grab a coffee, get a haircut, buy some fake CDs, all of the above? Well, by the looks of it I'd be stuck here in the room before I even do one of the mentioned.

Do I lack friends? I think not. The problem is, my barkada doesn't really ""get together"" too often, they're hard to really ask to hang-out with, and they have lives of their own. Then there's DOTA. Well, another thing is that I can't really hang-out with friends outside my barkada during a sembreak. Some aren't that close, some live too far (where most people live too far from me), some might spark a little controversy.

Oh yes, maybe I do need a girlfriend, if only to pass the time. That and love too I guess.

I wouldn't be this bored if my internet connection was considerably fast. But no. It's considerably slow. Having to watch YouTube videos of my favorite artists would entail me to wait an hour for a 4 minute-long film. Give me DSL or give me death.

I wanna buy some CDs but I lack the cash. I haven't really had my allowance since it's sembreak, and I really don't want to ask too much money from my loving parents because I know that all the blood and tears they sacrifice to earn this money will be spent on heckloads of CDs that I will only burn and stack on the cupboard, a overpriced trim at some salon, or a more overprized frappucino.

I am bored. Really really bored. I wanna get out of the house but I've got nowhere to go, I wanna be busy but I have noithing to do.

Hey, looks like YoutTube is at 2:30 of that 4:00 interview of The Strokes that I'm waiting to see. A good 25 minutes of waiting woll do the trick. I guess two cigarettes will cover that.

I was supposed to have my haircut later last afternoon, and it should have costed about P185. But as usual I got lazy, and spent my parents' hard-earned cash on pirated CDs instead. Yes, that's how good a son I am. Although I did pay P15 more than the mane trim, I was so much happier with 6 possibly great buys.

The CD stand does not seem to have Times They Are A Changing, so I bought Bob Dylan's album Blood On The Tracks. Last.Fm doesn't place it on the four most popular Dylan albums, but it did get a high rating in rateyourmusic.com so this should be good.

Do I detect a Muse-fest to last me weeks, possibly months? Oh yeah. Three buys I am certainly sure to like would be the first three albums Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and Absolution. Right at this time I'm masturbating to Bellamy and tha gang's debut Showbiz, and although it lacks two tracks, it's still definitley A-mazing.

I was greatly disappointed at my last Sex Pistols buy ""The Great Rock N' Roll Swindle"" mainly because it has some weird tunes. Later on, I found out that the CD came with a movie, and therefore you can only understand some tracks after watching it. I was duped. Therefore I bought a 15-track Sex Pistols CD called ""No Future UK?"". After letting the internet fill out the track names it turned out to be a 20-track compilation released in 1992 called Kiss This. More for my money, maybe. But it turns out that most of the songs were included in TGRNRS. But it's P33. So I shouldn't complain right. (Talk about a great swindle).

Finally, I couldn't find Sam's Town in the pile. I promised myself that I would give it a try, and the plentiful reviews in last.fm sure did rouse my curiosity. I was going to give my take on it. So I asked the ""manong"" and he disappeared for five, only to resurface again triumphantly with the CD. Where the hell is that warehouse. I desperately wanna raid it.

I stumbled through the Korean channel Arirang and saw a that a movie was playing. I went through a similar boring experience in the past and was delighted by a ""cute"" film that left me entertained. Although I never got the chance to repeat it, I was quite hoping that I would be presented with the same satisfaction. Well, I was more than entertained. I was touched by the film. I know, yuck.

As I am writing this it has been about a 15 minutes from when the film ended, and judging by my persistence to find that film title I immediately logged on the internet, put on Google armed only with the search words ""korean film HAM device"", which bore no answers. I tried my best to name the lead female character and entered ""korean film song-eun"". Not only did I get weird results, but the first search reply was a korean pornographic site. I really wanted to know the title of the film that got my insides kind of aching, but I sort of thought that it was going to be impossible. But then I entered a last ditch effort and it got me where I wanted to be. It was ""korean film HAM radio"".

The film was Kim Jung-Kwon's 2000 movie ""Ditto"".

<a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k253/luishernando/ditto___________111.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

Like my search inquiries would suggest, the movie revolved around the conversations of two people via the HAM radio. But the catch is that the male character Ji In was living in the peaceful, economically stable South Korea of 2000 while the female character So-Eun was living in the politically turbulent martial law era of 1979. Through their conversations they find out that albeit studying in the same school they are living in very different times. But that is not where the conflict ends, as both soon learn that So-Eun's love interest, who she had been narrating to Ji In as the guy who looks at her eyes one at a time, from left to right; the one she loves, turns out to be his father, and his mother; So-Eun's best friend. This led her to decide to break ties with the guy, knowing that fate decided that it wasn't meant to be. Ji In is in a very delicate situation, as his conversations with So-Eun becomes some sort of a window to as what fate had in store for her life.

Although I make a very bad summary because of the inlux of details that I feel should be mentioned, I am sure that there are a lot of sites that would offer better summaries. What I really liked about the movie albeit its supernatural and overly-cheesy plot is its female character So-Eun. The actress Kim Ha-Nul (BTW, I googled the names and stuff; I totally had no idea who these people were before Ditto) portrayed her very well, that silent emotional hurricane that I am quite too familiar of. As cheesy as it sounds, I felt her pain. The character made my insides tingle. Her eyes made mine look inwardly. Her sorrows made me remember mine. Her solitude made me want to shun mine and just to be of comfort to her. Her face made my heart beat; I was in-love with an idea. The idea of being a tool to eliminate her solitude and her sadness. The idea that my own sorrows will perish by being that tool.

I love the film because it made me feel. My insides were aching with So-Eun, angry that I can never be there to comfort her, or in that case anyone like her. I knew what loneliness and solitude can do to a person, how it tears a person apart from the inside out, and how it makes you reach out to anything, even a HAM radio that responds in a form of a person 20 years in the future.

Another major highlight would be the ending. In the present both characters met. Like my person, the meeting made the most impact over everything that occured in the movie. But no words were spoken, only a glance, a bow, and a scent. This spoke every word in the world, and more. After this the HAM radio ceased to work, and although words could no longer be sent over 20 years, everything is settled.

In the film So-Eun asks ""If you love someone so hard, can you eventually get him?"". My wish is that I could give that question a yes.

Ten counts before I'm forced to talk
When I am more inclined to walk
Nine minutes before I sleep
I use the time to think and weep
Eight songs heard before I stand
In my mind there plays the band

I'm not at the least shy
I wouldn't mind saying hi
But sometimes people just got nothing to say
And would prefer acting in their own way

Seven people I greet with a smile
The last time I'll talk would be a while
Six words gently spill from my mouth
In no time I'll be facing south
Five people I greet with a smile
Then my mind'll travel a mile

I'm not at the least shy
I wouldn't mind saying goodbye
It's just that some people talk way too much
And some wouldn't dare do such

Four hours before we eat our lunch
This guy sure knows how to pack a punch
Three insults is what it would take
Oh don't stop, if only for my sake.
Two days before I finally write
It took a whole lot longer to drain the spite

I'm not at the least shy
Believe me I do try
I'd do anything for you to fancy me
Just back off a little will you please?

One heart I felt severed; alone
I have lied a million times

"event","One the way home, we passed by a friend of my sister. She had a boyfriend bring her to her house, about five minutes after we arrived. Damn, she just turned eighteen.

This year, I'm turning twenty.

And at the first right our car made after this little visit, I suddendly thought to myself.

""Life is passing me by.""

I know, I'm twenty. But what is amazing is what my weird little mind thought of next. If I was twenty, and, say, that I lived until sixty, then I have spent a third of my life here on earth! What the fuck was I thinking this morning and almost every morning before that, that the best is still to come?

Carpe diem-ing is my worst trait, but I always comforted myself with the thought that the future is going to be better. But after the glaring statistics, I am on the brink of wasting a third of this God-given breath.

I should act. I should change. I should confront my fears and anxieties.

And I try. I really do. But it seems as if I have lost my real self. The me before all of this. I seem to feel less gratified with friends, I feel less interested in studying, I sometimes feel better walking alone in school without anyone to talk to, listening to my music and retreating to a world where an average-looking girl is teaching me violin, after which we perform Pachelbel's Canon in D Major to perfection, while both of us stare at the glare of each others' eyes, lost in the beauty of the music. That would be better than anything. A glimpse to her soul.

I refuse to believe that a girlfriend is the solution to everything. I will act to fulfill my innate desire to be loved, but I will firmly stand by this.


""I don't want to change your mind,
 I don't want to change the world.
 I just wanna watch it go by,
 I just want to watch it go by. ""

"event","The absence of something makes the heart grow fonder, they say. I say it it dwindles the comfort zone that a person resides in to the point that it forces him to act on that fleeting want and therefore leave the said zone. In this process, after being left empty and exposed, one will feel the incredible need to expose his fragile self to the world, for all to consume and counter-consume, based on whether they believe you to be good enough. And that would only be to that one person you kind of think would be worthy of it, and hopefully gracious enough to either accept you for your faults and your shaky confidence, or virtually erase the thought of you being together with the least amount of pain possible.

The world? In one person?

Exactly. Albeit the great need to be admired, looked upon and respected by the most number of people possible, that one person you are willing to expose your raw unadulterated self will mean the whole world, the positivity of the feeling rendered insignificant; the result would have no bearing. Happiness or pain will be felt in gigantic proportions. This is where the value of courage and will comes into play.

Considering the probability that it is going to be an overwhelming flood of pain and renewed self-doubt, it is up to a person to summon all the courage he can, muster it from his own perception of himself, of others' and of his belief that he is a person worthy of reciprocation. AND of course, one must not forget the grace that God would be willing to bestow on him in that particular time and situation.

And if this courage source points begin to fluctuate and when the supply begins to dwindle, then it might cause the building of another temporary comfort zone to shelter on while regrouping. But courage once again plays a part, as the second choice would be to go headfirst into the unfriendly odds, dive into the murky abyss and come out, victorious or otherwise, a better man.

But most of the time, I go for my usual first option. I'm a loyal customer."

I have been involved in the past, and I have learned that seeking love in order to alleviate the inconcrete feeling of emptiness and loneliness I feel from time to time isn't really a good idea. Love diminishes; what remains is an attachment, a risilient cling, a cigarette smoker hooked with the idea that a smoke is never too far away.

But what if suddenly the supply breaks? A breakdown of epic proportion occurs. 

A likely result from something built with utter dependency. Therefore, I may sometimes miss being in-love, but I can be happy without it. I won't make the same mistake twice. I feel elated by the fact that the pangs of loneliness don't visit me as much anymore. 

I guess I realized something totally obvious. My loneliness is fraud, I was never really alone.

With this recognition I will build myself. I will make sure that I will see someone complete, secure and worthy of anything and everything beautiful. I am not to break in the first strike, bend in the first storm, collapse in the weight of something I blindly ventured in.

"event","I just talked to a friend about a person's feeling of inadequacy and how it proverbially strikes hardest after the act of giving everything, and the absence of the expected reciprocation.

I think to reciprocate is no longer human. It is divine. An act warranted by God himself. To love someone who loves you with total disregard about anything else except the purest of feelings being offered is a product of heavenly descent. 

But to reject, to push away, to prejudice, to hamper the advance of something beautiful, is totally an act of man. In fact, it is what he does best. Man did it to Jesus, man did it to Galileo, hell, man even did it to a certain Zinedine Zidane.

They don't care whether Jesus was healing people left and right, that he was turning water into wine and ressurecting the dead. He was different and he didn't fit the status quo. He was too radical and he was too good. Too good to be true in fact. Therefore, he was shamed and crucified.

They also didn't care that Galileo was creating telescopes and formulating theories, such as a certain principle called gravity. He was too radical for the Church to comprehend. He saw things that the omniscient Vatican could not. He was too good. In fact, too good to be true. His theories was rejected and he was exiled where he could never again shatter the foundations that man was sitting on.

Zinedine Zidane was a player of great achievements in the world of football. He was even deemed as the best player of his generation, along with the likes of Diego Maradona and Pele. He was magical, and his feet seemed to have minds of their own. Yet age has caught up with him, and failures had begun appearing in his track record in his final stretch as a player. The failure of France in both the World Cup of 2002 and Euro 2004, along with the trophy drought of Real Madrid was particularly seen, as an offshoot of his growing inadequacy. Now at 34 he is leading France tommorow for a berth in the World Cup Finals, eliminating favorites Brazil in the process. Too good to be true, but I pray you check any sports website and more probably than not it will dawn his name in big bold letters.

Man is blind, fickle and stubborn. He chooses to fixate on the minute weakness and blemishes without an awareness of the overall picture, a line of sight that refuses to transcend the obviously shallow. He does not realize that even his own eyes betray him. Zidane may well be world champion come Sunday, Galileo one of the greatest scientists of our whole history, and Jesus turned out to be God himself.

Therefore, anyone blind enough to see everything behind the tangible presentation which is the human body along with the usually underlying anti-social, anti-status quo and non-conformistic disposition is in fact the most inadequate of all. He was given eyes yet he refuses to see. 

To see that something infinitely beautiful being offered (and in large servings too) albeit the deceptive form by which it is presented is to transcend his fatedness as man. It is to reciprocate. It is to become a window that offers a peek of what God, Heaven and all those intangibles are really all about."

You had to go for the rich-looking OC type cutie.

Well, I couldn't blame you. If I weren't me then I wouldn't notice me that much. But it does get me a little sometimes. Like when I saw Esteban Cambiasso crying after their defeat of heart-breaking proportions to hosts Germany, I kind of suddendly felt really sad and unpurposely felt what seemed to be tears forming around my eyes. And it fell. And while that was happening I suddendly thought of you and a little more wet my face.

I have no fucking idea why I'm crying for Cambiasso and more fucking so that I'm crying for you. And I saw your picture. You didn't even look that good. You looked stupid."

"event","I read my previous post and hell did I sound like a wanker. It was funny and stupid at the same time.

What do you do when you wholeheartedly accept the fact that the past had given you nothing but trouble, shame and pain, and that the best way to be ridding yourself of those feelings was to completely erase any links to that period of time where all feels dark and cloudy.

I do not want to be cutting people off from my life, especially those who try to really reach out. But it is a part of me which I wish to delete. I want nothing to do with the events of the past. Or the people in it.

But the thing is, I want to be less of an asshole as possible while I'm set on delete. People just can't be ignored and scrapped. I did this once and I still regret it. But what occurred cannot be undone, therefore I shall not expound.

This time, though, is different. I see this as a return to a personhood, a self and a dignity that I chose to forego if only to be of equal footing with people who obviously aren't of the same disposition. It was a pretention, albeit with noble intentions. But noble intentions aren't enough, are they? What I get in return is a realization that I am in a place that I honestly do not want to be. I am a dot in white paper, a neon green in a sea of black. I did not belong. I was trying to fit in, but I stood out more. Now I realize it wasn't anthing close to being a bad thing. Wolves aren't meant to be with sheep after all.

Therefore, I see this as the right thing to do. A necessary evil. So to anyone concerned, pardon the snobbery and the blank replies, but you.doc is about to be placed in the recycle bin, right-clicked, and erased forever."

"event","Just got through a very tedious day. Honestly, it wasn't that tiring at all. But my head hurts, and no matter just how much food I eat it just won't go away. I have to read a couple of pages for Philosophy but I can't really understand anything feeling like this, so I think I'll postpone the reading a couple of minutes.

School has been okay. Kinda fun and it;s great talking to different people again. I still feel that I haven't completely broken through my ""Wallflower Complex"", yet I feel that I;m making huge progress. I still don't have the Midas Touch of the other people I know but, hell, I am me and You are you said Shikamaru. And I know it rhymed.

Yet, one of the toppers in my priority list isn't getting any progress. Yes, It's love. I do not know why I do not act with urgency. I just can't force things. I believe love is like a song. It just has to be at the right time; it can't be forced. Try listening to Saves The Day a little too much after a tiring day, when you're head feels as if it's about to break. You will be pissed. And boy, these guys are my favorite band of all time! But try putting on some Stars, possibly Calendar Girl or The Big Fight, and you will see how timing affects everything.

This is the part where it gets to be ""The QC"": And to you my friend, I do not know what I really feel. You draw me to you in a way that I could not explain. Yet when I get sucked in by your charm I feel that we kinda don't have that Yin and Yang thing going for us. And that makes me extremely sad, especially because I know for a fact that I will be the best thing that could ever happen to you, not because of anything else, but because I will be your slave.

Your Slave. Of Love."

Do I like you
I sure do not know
I sometimes wish you would assume a little
Every touch, give it meaning
Every smile, be assuming
Every joke, is me revealing
That you sure damn make me melt.
Whoever you are."

Fourth, I feel light and bouncy, I'm gonna figure out this LJ thing later, but now to the TV to watch Nip/Tuck. I know, GHEY. But whatever. Adios."

Nick is such a gentlman (idk how to spell that lol) he like opened the door and was like...after you, and did the little hand wave thing...lol...Then we had to go get some more chairs, and I couldn't lift them so I told one of the kotches to do it for me...haha...Then meg threw a chip at emily which brought back memories from wendies, with the ice and french frie fights. So then Nick and his nuts...wow...he kept on bein like want some nuts!?...which was like the ""want some ices??"" lmao. Then me and meg sayin ""oh my god"" at the same time...wow...that was kida freaky/hilarious. and meg's great comment: ""This fork is really sturdy"" lmao, that was the best. And the staring contests were back on with me and nick....lol....And emily and lauren made us all x-mas cards, ((they are so cutee)) and we told the boys there were $20- bills in them so they believed us, and like tore them open...haha...that's jim for yah. So yeah...it was so much funn!! it was great to see everyone again because we never really get to talk in school.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Then later on Gabe called, and he came over for a little bit, and we were hanging out in his car....he was making fun of me for my ringtones.....I'm not ""ghetto"" enough for him....haha... Then when I was getting out of the car the lights in my garage went on by themselves (which they need a switch to get turned on) and both my parents were upstairs, and there was no one else home so now I'm convinced there are ghosts in my house....lol</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Then today I went over eric's house and hung out there for a while....wow....great times, We were walking around, and we had to jump across&nbsp;a creek, but yeah....I didn't jump far enough so my shoe got stuck in the mud, and all the water went pouring in...haha...so eric let me wear his shoe for a little bit, and then when we were going back,&nbsp;I like slid down in the mud running up the hill...lmao...&nbsp;but when we got back out to the road he his&nbsp;shoe&nbsp;took it back, so I was walking around with one shoe off, and I got mud all over his sweatshirt and my jeans...haha...When we got back to his house we ate some yummy poptarts ((lmao)) and watched goodfellas because he is completly obsessed with that movie, and he's always talking about it so we watched it...It's pretty good, except for the parts where everyone gets killed....So after the movie he played video games and I colored this paper thing in to go on his wall for the black light...arts and crafts!!!, and listened to some music....he got me into&nbsp;Marilyn Manson&nbsp;now...and...I named his turtle frank/frankie...from the tv show franklin lol. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>Sara-Thank you so much for everything you have done....You put so much of your time into talking to me, when you could have just said ""fuck you, get a life"" or something like that...I know you want the best for me, and I love you for that. And I know you think that everything you say to me just goes in one ear and out the other because everything keeps continuing, but it dosn't I really do think about everything you say to me, even though it dosn't seem like it at the time. Most people I have told are just like ""why...?"" and thats the end of that conversation, but you keep on my ass about it, and sometime threaten me, and I know your doing it because you care, and have seen other people with the same problems and you don't want me going down the same path....I know I can always come and talk to you about everything that gets to me, and either you'll talk to me about ways to solve it, or just make fun of something and show it's stupid to be thinking about.....Thank you so much for being there for me, You're truly the best friend anyone could ever ask for, and I think that the way we became friends is what makes us even better friends....I love you so much!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Eric-Thank you for always being there for me...I love talking to you mainly because you're going through the same things that I am...and I know that what I'm feeling with it, you probibly are too....You're an awsome person, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise...You always make me feel better whenever I'm upset about something because you tell me how great of a person I am, and how I dont need to be worrying about that crap. You're so much fun to be around....With all the stupid things you have done...and I know you're not going to judge me on somethings...((like in bio/eng..haha)) and the one thing that is always going to stick in my head is how I said I only want to be around people who I know aren't going to hurt me...and then I asked if you ever would, and you said ""hellz no""...and a couple mins. later you said the only way that you would ever hurt me was if I ever tried a hard core drug, and then you'd have to kill me....And I think that you are awsome for still hanging out for me even when tim got all you're friends&nbsp;to start&nbsp;yellin ""mac it"" whenever we are together....You don't let it bug you, when with most other guys it they would be like screw you, and go hang out with their boyz....And just for the fact that we are still great friends even with the crap that has happened....You are such a great friend, and I know I can come to you with all my problems, and you know that you can come to me with all you're problems and we'll solve them together...I love you dude!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Sam-wow, what can I say??....""the last thing I can remeber is....cool whip!"" lmao...We haven't been friends for that long, I feel like I've known you for the longest time...We have shared so many good times together....-the gum theory, -suck a canloe, -the edgar days, -my ass, and so much more...You have heard all the boy drama and think of ways to solve it. I love when we hang out because we only need one look, and we'll be laughin hysterically. You were there for my break down, and you stayed with me to make sure I was ok....We always help eachother out with the guy stituations....and think of great ways to solve them...We always go to eachother to vent, and I think that that has made us such great friends...</FONT><FONT size=2>&nbsp;you're so awsome to be around, I love you so much!!!

He used to be intelligent, with an engaging sense of humor. That was before he leaped from a building. Now, he's brain-damaged and will always need care. He staggers and has seizures. He lives in a fog. But, worst of all, he KNOWS he used to be normal.<BR><BR>What about pills? Ask the 12-year-old with extensive liver damage from an overdose. Have you ever seen anyone die of liver damage? You turn yellow. It's a hard way to go.<BR><BR>What about a gun? Ask the 24-year-old who shot himself in the head. Now he drags one leg, has a useless arm and has no vision or hearing on one side. He lived through his ""foolproof"" suicide. You might too.<BR><BR>But ... who will clean your blood off the carpet or scrape your brains from the ceiling? Commercial cleaning companies may refuse that job--but SOMEONE has to do it.<BR><BR>Who will have to cut you down from where you hung yourself or identify your bloated body after you've drowned? Your father? Your mother? Your wife? Your son?<BR><BR>The carefully worded ""loving"" suicide note is of no help. Those who loved you will NEVER completely recover. They'll feel regret and an unending pain.<BR><BR>Suicide is contagious. Look around your family. Look closely at the 4 year old playing with his cars on the rug. Kill yourself tonight, and he may do it ten years from now.<BR><BR>You DO have other choices. There are people who can help you through this crisis. Call a hotline. Call a friend. Call a family member. Call your minister or priest. Call a doctor or hospital. Call the police. They will tell you that there's hope. Maybe you'll find it in the mail tomorrow. Or in a phone call this weekend. But what you're seeking could be just a minute, a month, or a day away.<BR><BR>You say you don't want to be stopped? Still want to do it? -- Well, then, I may see you in the psychiatric ward later. And we'll work with whatever you have left.<BR><BR>Remember: Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.<BR><BR>***IF YOU'RE READING THIS, PLEASE STEAL IT AND PUT IT IN YOUR JOURNAL TOO.***</FONT></P>

<h2>You Are Right Brained In Love</h2>
Bit of a drama queen<br>
Peacemaker, first to end a fight<br>
Good at thinking up creative dates<br>
Tend to fall in love and get hurt easily<br>
Going with your gut instead of your head<br>
Emphathetic and caring, sometimes to a fault<br>
Good at recognizing patterns in relationships<br>
Been in love many times, perhaps too many to count<br>
Wildly passionate and intense when falling in love<br>
Spontaneous with relationships, going with the flow<br>
Overly visual - can play back past dates like movies in your mind<br>
Roses, love poems, and stuffed animals are a good start to winning your heart

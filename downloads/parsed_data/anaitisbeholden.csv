His birthday party was a blast, just as our first few years with him have been.

"event","The last morning of Flipside, Ambient woke up before dawn and headed out of the camper to sit at a fire just at the edge of our camp.  I had made a mistake the night before and I knew that he was angry at me, although we hadn't talked about it yet.  I went out to sit beside him.  For awhile we sat in front of the fire, huddled in a blanket, without a word between us. 
 
It had already been a very rough year.  There had been strife between the two of us and my heart was still hurting from the issues between us and the loss of an important relationship earlier in the year. Anger has always made me anxious and yet as I sat there, I felt calm.  I knew he was angry, I knew I'd messed up and that he had a right to be angry, but I also knew that we would work out it, that we would get through it. 

In the distance, the party was still going at one of the camps. As the sun started to come up, they began playing ""Don't Stop Believing"" over and over again.  As cheesy as it was, it was the perfect song for the moment and we could not help but laugh and smile at each other.  In spite of the anger and the tension, there was a peace that fell over us sitting there together, watching the sun, feeling the warmth from the fire, and listening to that silly song played over and over again.  It was clear that as rough as things had been, we were already stronger for it all.  Little did we know that as bad as the year had been, it was going to be getting a whole lot worse, worse than either of us could imagine. That said, we did get through it and we are, in the end, stronger.

When 2009 ended, like many people, I had a lot to let go of, a lot I wanted to leave behind me.  When I heard that we'd be burning a coffin in effigy to 2009, I knew this was the perfect opportunity to let go of the remnants of the year.  Knowing how much it meant to me, Ambient spent the afternoon New Year's Day building the coffin.  His hard work on the coffin, after all he'd already done to help and support me throughout the year, made it all the more meaningful.

When it was done I placed three letters into the coffin, alongside the various items of ""anti-memorabilia"" that the others at camp placed in the coffin.  Once it was filled, the lid was closed, and we all took turns pounding nails into the coffin.  It was cathartic to say the least.

<table style=""width:auto;""><tr><td><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pjfPVk2syJhUX_wXuIclAQ?feat=embedwebsite""><img src=""http://lh6.ggpht.com/_JCwFQ1tuZf4/S0VnRqhqlmI/AAAAAAAAHiU/gSjgDDSbvng/s144/IMG_2815.JPG"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style=""font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right"">From <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/Bug4HClub/Coffin2009Effigy?feat=embedwebsite"">Coffin2009Effigy</a></td></tr></table>

Then it was time to burn the coffin. The ""pall bearers"" carried the coffin to the fire.  We gathered around and watched as the fire spread to the coffin.  Watching the coffin, containing my own letters and bearing so much symbolism for me personally, as it burned was extremely emotional for me.

Some people started holding hands as we shared in the moment. And then someone started singing ""Don't Stop Believing"", taking me back to that moment so many months ago, when things seemed to be at their worst but were about to get even worse.  As I sung along, the tears that were welling in my eyes dissipated and that same peace from so many months ago fell over me.

<lj-embed id=""12""/>

I'm not about to say that 2010 could not possibly be worse.  I know that it could very well be.  But if it is, as in 2009, we will get through it.  If its another bad year or even worse than 2009 was, dammit, I'm going to have the most awesome family bonds, relationships, and character by the end of it all ;-)"

"event","Livejournal has been an active part of my life for such a long time, it seems strange to have been away for a month.  Big things have been happening in my life, both good and bad.  I find the landscape of my life changing, that the ground is still solid but not in the same form as it was six months or a year ago.  I am learning to see the world with new eyes and finding new ears to listen to my tales, while learning to treasure the insight and advice of those who have known and continued to love me over the years.  I am learning that life gives us what we need and that sometimes that is a kick in the ass as often as it is a gentle embrace and more often than not its both.  I am learning to see the patterns in my own and the behaviors of others and learning what things I can accept, what things are within my control and how to control them, and what things are beyond ability to change or impact.  I am in the process of transforming, but it is hard work.  I have slept and I have danced, I have talked and I have sung, I have cried and I have laughed. Someday maybe I'll write again...

In the meantime, I continue to keep up with the smaller things, including minor quips about the boys, work, my day to day life, and other various asundry things through Facebook.  If you aren't already on my Facebook friends list, comment (screened) with your name and I'll add you."

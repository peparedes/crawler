<div align=""center"" class=""ljcut"" text=""Click for REVIEW"">ading down to the Reading Rooms early to catch our friend Gary's&nbsp; band <strong><font color=""#000000"">'</font><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thedescartes"">Descartes</a><font color=""#000000"">' </font></strong><font size=""2""><font color=""#000000"">(check 'em out,they're actually <strong>pretty fab</strong>!), I caught up with a few of my mates although the Rooms were <strong>still incredibly quiet for a show i believed to be sold/packed out</strong>.<br /><br />Soon, with a <strong>Jack D and lemonade</strong> in my hand, the <strong>small but delightful</strong> audience stood impatiently waiting for Descartes to begin their debut gig. There wasn't&nbsp; that great a <strong>crowd response</strong>, but me and my friends made them feel wonderful by <strong>dancing like crazy,</strong> and shouting (jokingly) crude <strong>remarks of support</strong>. <br />They rocked the gig with <strong>intelligent lyrics and punchy, typical indie-rock numbers</strong>, which <strong>impressed</strong> me to a fair extent.<br /><br />During Descartes last song, I realised... ""Oh, shit."" I had forgotten my keys and phone, which I kind of needed intending to go home late.<br />With that, my pal and I <strong>sped down to the garage </strong>to call my house and make sure I could get in okay. Getting <strong>more and more headfucked</strong>, we ended up back in the rooms having missed the support band we didn't really want to see and catching up with some good banter from a few guys we hadn't seen in ages. <br /><br />Next band on were Trash Superstar, who I used to loathe. This time they were actually <strong>enjoyable</strong>, and really <strong>dancy</strong>. The female vocalist, Becca gave it her all with her <strong>shrieky voice</strong> which reminded me of <strong>Joan Jett</strong> (well, a little bit). <strong>Thouroughly enjoyable</strong>.<br /><br />Finally, the long awaited <strong>Neil's Children</strong> came on (the rooms still not as busy as I had expected). With an <strong>applause</strong>, the band kicked off with a new song which I wasn't so sure about but the <strong>punk-rock ""idontgiveafuck"" image/attitude </strong>certainly <strong>complimented their raceous, kick-arse tunes</strong>. <br />A <strong>wonderful band, wonderful show</strong> although I was <strong>pretty pissed off they didn't play my favourite ""I Hate Models""</strong>. <br /><br />There was a few great dances (before everyone departed) to </font><strong><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/lickthewitches"">Carla</a></strong></font><font size=""2"" color=""#000000""> to songs such as ""<strong>Up the Bracket</strong>"", as she dj'd for her new clubnight.<br /><br />Stumbling along the road to our friend Craig's flat (who wasnt impressed at us buzzing his flat for laughs since he had a uni presentation next day), then a while more to the taxi rank- me and Katie got home and I had the lovely premonition of having to face school with one <strong>hellish hangover</strong> and sore feet from dancing so much! (Oh, and a few cuts &amp; bruises also)</font></div>

<div text=""CLICK FOR REVIEW"" class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"" color=""#000000"">After <strong>catching a few Metric songs</strong> at the outdoor venue Stubbs (which wasn't that fantastic), we dashed off to La Zona Rosa (which was horribly far away, therefore horrible reminiscent of the first night we were in Austin- the night with the sore feet). <br /><br />The first thing we saw tearing round the dim, filthy backstreet of La Zona Rosa was the <strong>monsterous queue to see the most hyped band of the moment, the Arctic Monkeys</strong>. The place was packed out, and yet the queue still remained long. Even the queue for special passes, what me and my friend had.<br />Sauntering down beside the queue, we<strong> bumped into Dirty Pretty Things once again</strong>, with an <strong>""Alright ladies?"" from Mr Carl Barat himself!</strong><br />Feeling far to shy to have patter with DPT, we headed straight down to join the queue anyway, it seemed to be taking forever to go down so not all that bothered, my friend and myself headed round the corner to see if we could catch DPT again, but they were inside. We collapsed on the street opposite the venue, knackered. Soon a fifty-something year old man, with what could easily be the <strong>world's longest moustache</strong> sat down beside us and started talking about his wife and children, which not to be rude, I was <strong>not even remotely interested</strong> in. We left the fella, and sat right outside the venue til the queue right down.<br /><br /><strong>Twanging guitars, sharp beats of the bass drum and Alex Turner's thick Sheffield tone</strong> were very clear from where we were sitting as we heard the Monkeys launch into ""<strong>I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor</strong>""<br /><br />Soon we realised,<strong> WHY ARE WE SITTING HERE ON A SHITTY STREET? GET INSIDE. </strong>And so with the queue fairly smaller, we walked indoors.<br />The minute we got in, it was <strong>hard to breathe</strong>. Never mind see the band, <strong>every sweaty fucker in there looked like they were genuinely loving it</strong>, as they yelled/screamed the lyrics to songs still only avaliable on the internet.<br /><br />The songs that really stuck in my mind were '<strong>Dancing shoes</strong>' played with every bit of <strong>enthusiasm and sophistication</strong>, regardless of however many people say the Arctic Monkeys are <strong>up their own arses (which is believable)</strong> at least they still <strong>play as if they're enjoying themselves</strong>- and ""<strong>When the Sun Goes Down""</strong> (when it was difficult to hear Alex singing because of the audience, taking a distinct pleasure in screaming ""<strong>Well he's a scumbag don't you know</strong>"" at the top of their voices).<br />Barging once again nearer the front (side) we got a better view of the band themselves, Alex looking every inch the rockstar- although reminiscent of&nbsp; KKK member with his white hoody (hood up) (and may I point out, Alex had a<strong> steady flow of beer down his neck</strong>- hmm, how did he manage that... 21 year old drinking law! ; )) and&nbsp; on a complete adrenaline rush,<strong> began skanking away&nbsp; not giving a toss what anyone else thought</strong>.<br /><br />Just to top off the last band we'd see of South by South West before returning back to dreary Scotland, we realised we were standing next to <strong>Anthony Rossomando of Dirty Pretty Things</strong>, we nabbed a photo with him, and returned to <strong>enjoying the band</strong>. However, we couldn't leave without <strong>grabbing Keith (We Are Scientists) for a chat</strong>, who seemed very happy to chat about his stunt he had just pulled:<strong> leaping on stage to play with the Monkeys during 'Fake Tales of San Fransisco'.</strong> <br />We also found a<strong> very drunk Carl</strong> with his girlfriend Annalisa who we caught up with for a few questions, to which we got <strong>responses about Germany, Swastikas and </strong>""Ladies that photographh may be a bit shaky, I'm a bit shaky. Look, shaky<strong>!</strong>"" <strong>Wonderful Carlos, but what the hell are you talking about?</strong><br /><br />It was a <strong>terrific gig</strong>, the Arctic Monkeys sounding as <strong>squeaky clean as ever</strong>, <strong>no diappointments </strong>and </font><strong><font size=""3"" color=""#000000"">I really do believe the hype. </font><br /></strong></div>

<div text=""CLICK FOR REVIEW OF NME BBQ PARTY"" class=""ljcut""><font color=""#000000"">Today we headed to the<strong> Mean Eyed Cat </strong>(an unusal venue, looking pretty <strong>run-down and ramshackle</strong>, also being used in the hit movie<strong> the Texas Chainsaw Massacre</strong>.), for one of the most exciting trips of the event, the <strong><font size=""4"">NME BBQ Party</font></strong>. <br /> On stepping out of taxi, we were <strong>greeted by Carl Barat and Gary Powell</strong> of <strong>Dirty Pretty Things</strong>. Carl buggered off, but Gary stuck around recognising us from yesterday. So we chatted to Gary for around 10 minutes and he had to <strong>scuttle off to soundcheck</strong> so after being refused entry (*is still raging about strictly over 21 policies in America, especially since it would have been FINE at home, with home being 18+*) but decided to stick around since we'd paid for the cab there. <br /><br /> We <strong>spotted Zane Lowe filming a SXSW Gonzo</strong> on the back of a truck and between the <strong>goods-trains deafeningly rumbling along behind us</strong>, we managed to hear the heavy&nbsp; Wakefield-accented '<strong>Cribs</strong>' before seeing them. After <strong>having a small giggle at Ryan Jarman</strong> being so noisy, everyone disappeared leaving me and my friend in this <strong>dusty car park</strong>. <br /><br /><strong>Determined to see Dirty Pretty Things live</strong> for the first time, we <strong>maneuvered ourselves onto this log</strong> and poked our heads over the fence being able to<strong> clearly see Dirty Pretty Things.</strong> Watching the set, which seemed to fire in fairly quickly, it was <strong>insanely uncomfortable</strong> but we managed, <strong>copping a few rude gestures at the security who had refused us </strong>behind his back (<em><strong>oh how mature!</strong></em>)<br /> Carl's <strong>mumbling and grumbling mid-set banter</strong> was not quite what we'd expected since his <strong>rauceous Libertine days</strong>, yet <strong>Dirty Pretty Things did not fail to impress</strong>.</font>   </div>

<div text=""The Travelling//Day ONE."" class=""ljcut""><br />
<div align=""center"">  </div>
<div align=""center""> There was a hell of a lot of travelling in order to get there, <strong>driving to Edinburgh</strong>, flight from <strong>Edinburgh to London</strong>, <strong>London to Dallas</strong>, <strong>Dallas to Austin</strong>. Which none of is really worth describing- it's pretty imaginable.<br />Psyched to be heading to SXSW, one of the world's biggest music festivals, there was a lot of impatient waiting and uncomfortable dozing during the flights. It seemed pretty easy to forget I was heading to America.<br />The plane food was disgusting, served at all the wrong times when you're just not hungry at all and even the odour of something that could taste good makes you want to wretch. The inflight entertainment was nice though, as I managed to have a nice fifteen minute sleep after watching 'Walk the Line'. <br />The only slight excitement was the <strong>Magic Numbers </strong>sitting behind us. Not being huge fans,&nbsp; as me and my friend hummed the only song we knew- 'Forever Lost' cheekily.<br /><br />After what seemed like forever, <strong>we touched down in Austin, Texas.</strong><br />We grabbed our bags and a taxi- sorry, 'cab' and had our ears blasted off by some LOUD, heavy drum and bass. Arriving at the hotel, I took in the surroundings, tall reception with a huge mirror with elaborate carvings and marble-tile flooring. It was gorgeous.<br /></div>
<br /><font size=""6"" color=""#00ccff""><br /></font> <font size=""6"" color=""#00ccff""><u>Day 1.</u></font><br /> After a fabulous night's sleep in the Marriot Hotel, we woke up and had to head downtown to the conference building to pick up our sxsw badges. Not realising they were photographic, I did not bother with make-up that day and I really wish I had... and we also received huge SxSW bags full of books, leaflets, magazines, demos,&nbsp; a hangover survival kit, condoms, pregancy tests (conclusion: intention is that everyone gets laid, AND pregnant at sxsw ; ))&nbsp; Anyway, the bag was really heavy so we took them back to the hotel and afterwards chilled out for a while downtown. Being far too hot, we headed to the air-conditioned conference bulding. We found a comfortable spot to watch everyone go by. <br /> The first cringe of the trip occurred just then. Three girls in crazy, idiotic costumes walked by, so naturally being girls, we started laughing without realising they were a fairly popular band, oops!<br /><br /> We Are Scientists walked past, and my mate subtly tried to tell me, but I continued blabbing away- oblivious. They were down the escalator before we had time to grab them. <br /><br /> In the time we sat gawping at various characters, several people ranging from young girls in stripey tights to huge, violent-looking Texan men with beer bellies enquired whether or not my friend and I were artists. <br /> Oh also, if my leopard print tights (sorry- 'hoes') were tattoos. No.<br /> And also- are we were some spanish hiphop band? No.<br /><br /> That day was spent doing all the tourist things, visiting cute little cafes, taking boat trips and taking photos of things that really don't matter...</div>

<div text=""CLICK TO READ REVIEW"" class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"" color=""#000000"">Being part of a festival, there was no support- except one long soundcheck, which caused the ecclectic crowd to grow impatient, 'tsking' and slouching trying to look like the coolest thing since sliced bread, although it wasn't working. </font><font size=""3""><br /></font><font size=""3"" color=""#000000"">This is where I really first found out how different the Texan crowd is from here in Scotland.<strong> In Scotland, these kids would be jumping and the atmosphere would be buzzing, I mused.</strong> This crowd were boring, to put it bluntly.

Daryl Palumbo then appeared, blowing out the punchy lyrics in his voice that is so out of tune if sounds fabulous.</font><font size=""3""><br /><br /></font><font size=""3"" color=""#000000"">There was one thing for sure, I'd been waiting for years to see this band and I was not going to stand there as if I was bored.

For him, it must have been like trying to get blood from a stone to get decent feedback from this crowd.</font><font size=""3""><br /></font><font size=""3"" color=""#000000"">Ploughing through most tracks from their first album, including hit single '<strong>Beating Hearts Baby</strong>'- which certainly inspired a <strong>riotuous sing along</strong> of hundreds of Americans trying to imitate Palumbo's voice.

<div text=""CLICK TO READ REVIEW"" class=""ljcut""><font size=""3"" color=""#000000"">The first thing to make me almost lose my temper was the trouble getting in to the Parrish due to there being full capacity, and it being over 21- very strict on ID. I didn't put myself through sheer pain to stand outside a venue. Luckily, I managed to <strong>blag myself in</strong> telling them I worked in A&amp;R and generally throwing a huge story at them til they caved in.<br /> <br /> Yet another disappointment, the <strong>support</strong> band sounded like <strong>nails scratching down a blackboard with shrill, shrieky vocals</strong> and lashes of <strong>guitar feedback</strong>. This band would not shut up. Constantly glancing at my watch I realised Art Brut should have well been on by now. Not in the best of moods, I demanded to know what was going on from the doorman. A familiar guitar sound floated from upstairs. Legging it up two flights of stairs, Eddie Argos chirped the catchy single '<strong>Emily Kane</strong>'. Hundreds of Americans screamed back at him in <strong>over-exaggerated English accents</strong>. Argos seems to justify his strange vocal way by thrashing through the next tune '<strong>Formed a Band</strong>', and throttling '<strong>Moving to L.A.</strong>' It was like an <strong>annihilation</strong>. <br /> <br /> Argos removed his shoes, the band danced and shook- influencing the crowd of the Parrish to cause what was near a riot.<br /> <br /> Finishing the performance with<strong> typical rock-star knocking over of mics</strong>, it had been a <strong>successful,</strong> well played show (well- the half I caught of it)</font></div>

<div text=""CLICK FOR REVIEW"" class=""ljcut""><font size=""2"" color=""#000000"">The day began with some doubt. Will he show up? What if he doesn't? However, the doubts were confirmed when by 9am, Pete Doherty had been in trouble with police for roaming public streets with alcohol. This became the tale of the day, ""I saw Pete this morning with police. He's in jail and he won't be showing up!""</font><font size=""2"" color=""#000000""><br /> </font>
<div align=""center""><font size=""2"" color=""#000000""><br />That evening, I really felt for all the indie fellas in their skinny jeans and trilbys (Peter's trade-mark hat), and ladies in tiny skirts who were shivering, due to the somewhat autumnal wind of Dundee in late September. Although there was so much excitement (and swigging from warming cans), such a buzzing atmosphere about I don't think they particularly cared. With a mate's dad owning the club in which Pete Doherty &amp; co were playing in, I had easy access to the warm building, after my mate fought her way downstairs to open the doors... only then did I escape the cold.<br /><br />Arriving at around 7pm and entering the club about fifteen minutes later, I spent some time upstairs with some of my mate's friends, not purposely ignoring the first support band. However, when the View took on stage, I wandered downstairs to see a riot of teens belting out this band's lyrics, bopping up and down, dancing excitedly.&nbsp; Admittedly, I had never heard the band. Yet I couldn't help but smile and tap my feet in time to the music. </font><font size=""2"" color=""#000000""><br /> </font> </div>
<div align=""center""><font size=""2"" color=""#000000""><br /> <br /> <img src=""http://i3.tinypic.com/wh1v74.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /> <br /> </font></div>
<font size=""2"" color=""#000000""><br /></font>
<div align=""center""><font size=""2"" color=""#000000"">Barging our way to the front, we ended up practically on the stage- absolutely exhausted and sweaty yet the 'spirit of Albion' was still obvious throughout the whole crowd, everyone chipper.<br />As the band took the stage, the roars and cheers got progressively louder. Yet, as expected, when Mr. Doherty swaggered into view, the applause was deafening. Looking exhausted and ill, my first thoughts were 'Oh dear, this show is not going to be what I expected...'&nbsp; <br />I was so wrong. The band blew me away with their singles 'Killamangiro' went down with a storm, keeping the reputation of their highly vivacious, messy, indie rock sound. The whole set made even more enjoyably rugged and high-spirited in a live setting.<br />Of course, a Babyshambles gig would not be a Babyshambles gig if there was not some sort of mishap. Frist time the power cut out, Pete was not prepared for the interuption, briefly losing his words. However, second time the power failed, Pete simply danced to the crowd belting back at him: ""Fuck forever! If you don't mind!""<br /><br />During the set, adoring fans threw t-shirts- along with other items of attire on stage as well as written notes. Pete read a few of these to which the mysterious writers made themselves known, revelling in the attention. <br />One of the notes included ""Ignore what the cunts and the photographers say,"" to which the crowd responded with enthusiastic agreement.<br />Pete also proved me wrong when he danced around stage, falling over several times, kept a strong voice the whole way through and from his swinging on pipes above the stage during their hour-long set.<br /><br />Much perspiration was sweated out and many bodies were left trampled, yet satisfied although there was disappointment as the band left stage without an encore.<br />However, this gig really did show the ashes of the Libertines has risen once again and Peter Doherty really is ""Back from the Dead"".<br /><br />Afterwards was a phenomonal personal experience. Since my best mate's dad owned the club, we were allowed to meet the band backstage. So we spent around an hour with Pete, Drew and Adam (unfortunately, or is that fortunately since Patrick isn' t my most favoured of the band) which was such a treat. After he promptly nicked my scarf, Mr Doherty gave my friend Katie her own version of&nbsp; Libertines tune ""What Katie Did"", and a few renditions of musical legends, Chas and Dave.</font></div>

Their enthusiasm and sparkling energy inspires others and sweeps them along. They enjoy being together with other people and often have an uncanny intuition for their motivations and potential. Spontaneous Idealists are masters of communication and very amusing and gifted entertainers. Fun and variety are guaranteed when they are around. However, they are sometimes somewhat too impulsive in dealing with others and can hurt people without really meaning to do so, due to their direct and sometimes critical nature.Spontaneous Idealist<br /><br />This personality type is a keen and alert observer; they miss nothing which is going on around them. In extreme cases, they tend to be oversensitive and exaggeratedly alert and are inwardly always ready to jump. Life for them is an exciting drama full of emotionality. However, they quickly become bored when things repeat themselves and too much detailed work and care is required. Their creativity, their imaginativeness and their originality become most noticeable when developing new projects and ideas - they then leave the meticulous implementation of the whole to others. On the whole, Spontaneous Idealists attach great value to their inner and outward independence and do not like accepting a subordinate role. They therefore have problems with hierarchies and authorities.<br /><br />If you have a Spontaneous Idealist as your friend, you will never be bored; with them, you can enjoy life to the full and celebrate the best parties. At the same time, they are warm, sensitive, attentive and always willing to help. If Spontaneous Idealists have just fallen in love, the sky is full of violins and their new partners are showered with attention and affection. This type then bubbles over with charm, tenderness and imagination. But, unfortunately, it soon becomes boring for them once the novelty has worn off. Boring everyday life in a partnership is not for them so that many Spontaneous Idealists slip from one affair into another. However, should the partner manage to keep their curiosity alive and not let routine and familiarity gain the upper hand, Spontaneous Idealists can be inspiring and loving partners.<br /><br />Adjectives which describe your type<br />spontaneous, enthusiastic, idealistic, extroverted, theoretical, emotional, relaxed, friendly, optimistic, charming, helpful, independent, individualistic, creative, dynamic, lively, humorous, full of zest for life, imaginative, changeable, adaptable, loyal, sensitive, inspiring, sociable, communicative, erratic, curious, open, vulnerable<br /><br />These subjects could interest you<br />literature, art, music, parties, concerts, travel, dancing, eating out, joint pleasure</blockquote><br /><br /><br />No real update, sorry. I wrote like 3 different posts and deleted them all because I did not like them. I'll try again later.<br />(Not to make this a complete waste, I did start up on Ritalin today. This is a new drug for me, and from what I saw today, it works nicely. I was actually able to read, and I read three short stories and a poem. It was FANTASTIC.)<br />"

"event","I feel like I should write some more. I kind of miss writing, so I am going to take this re-posting of a meme from Miss Joly as an excuse to update everyone who actually still uses LJ on my life.

The bad:
-When I returned this Summer, I was informed that my mother was diagnosed with a rare strain of kidney cancer. Within a week, she was in surgery to have a seven and a half pound tumor removed.
-Last Sunday night, I waited outside for an hour watching my neighbor be taken away in an ambulance. She died overnight in the hospital of congestive heart failure. She was about to undergo her third round of chemo for her recurrent breast cancer.

The good:
+My mother is recovering from surgery very nicely. She actually just drove herself to the movies to see Mama Mia! with a friend (Mrs. Calhoun, who has been exceptionally good to us during this time period).
+My friend Adam was given the news two days ago that he is officially, after several years, cancer free.
+I was fortunate enough to spend six weeks with my sister studying in Moscow, and it was absolutely amazing. I fell in love with Russia, met scores of incredibly interesting, awesome people from all walks of life, and learned a bit of the language at the same time.
+I spent the day yesterday at the Mayhem Festival. While most of the bands were terrible, I met some cool people, ran into a few old friends of mine, and had an all around amazing time.
+I'm still alive and well.

I'll try to update soon with a post that's a good mix of style and substance, as opposed to pure substance so it isn't such a chore to read. But for now, I willleave you with this meme stolen from Nicole Joly.

<lj-cut text=""...Click me!"">
Ten Things You Want to Say to Ten Different People.

1) Seriously, I think you're the most obnoxious person that I have ever met. The things that you do make me want to forcibly remove you from existence. 

2) Stop mooching. You fucked up, now own up to it. Get off your ass, get yourself a job and your own place to live.

3) If you have something to say to me, say it to my face. Stop going through him and then avoiding me.

4) You can be a really huge bitch but I stick up for you anyways, but even I have my limits. <i>(Believe me, you don't know who this is to.)</i>

5) I'm really glad that you've worked out what you need to do to get your life back on track. But I still worry about you.

6) I really don't think you appreciate me enough. <i>(Wahhh, stop whining, me.)</i>

7) You're probably one of the coolest people I have never met.

8) You're really awesome and sweet and I'm sorry that nothing became of us because I am a shallow asshole.

9) I'm really, really proud of you, man. You've come a really long way.

10) I admire your ambition to learn even if the subject doesn't hold your interest in the least.


Nine Things About Yourself.

1) When I do something wrong or stupid, it will literally haunt me for years. I still beat myself up over stupid things I said in Preschool.

2) I have a need to impress people all of the time.

3) I'm ridiculously tired all of the time.

4) My friends make me who I am. 

5) I wonder every day whether or not I am doing the right thing.

6) I am absolutely loving my research and I am learning so much.

7) I just discovered Blur and am in love with them.

8) I really undervalue myself and need to learn to stop.

9) I was not prepared for the differences between high school and college.

Eight Ways to Win My Heart.

1) Challenge me. Constantly.

2) Keep an open mind.

3) Have good morals.

4) Say ""thank you"" when someone does something nice. (I have to keep this from Laura's entry because it is VERY true.)

5) Trust me.

6) Be adventurous.

7) But at the same time, know when enough is enough.

8) Don't criticize my friends. I keep them around for a reason.

Seven Things That Cross Your Mind A Lot.

1) How much I miss some people.

2) ""I really should have done that.""

3) ""This can't end well.""

4) ""What day is it?""

5) What gifts I would get people if I won the lottery. (Is that weird? It's a new thing.)

6) Anything I learned recently that really stuck out.

7) How much I need somebody.

Six Things You Wish You Never Did.

Despite what i said before, I have nothing to put here.

Five Turn Offs.

1) Stubbornness.

2) Playing the victim.

3) People who talk about things they have no clue about.

4) Ignorance.

5) Social Leeches.

Four Turn Ons.

1) A quick wit.

2) Smelling good.

3) A sharp mind.

4) Putting up with me, haha.

Three Smileys That Describe Your Life.

1) -_-

2) :O

3) XP

Two Things You Want to Do Before You Die.

1) Travel the world with someone special.

2) Have something named after me.

One Thing You Want.

1) A significant other.

"event","I think there is something wrong with me, chemically. Neurologically, maybe. Something up there is misfiring or just plain not connecting. My moods do not make sense anymore-- often they are inappropriate for the given situation, and are unnervingly fleeting.

To make it clearer: after an amazing evening of relaxing with my friends, as I walk home, I'll feel a pang of guilt or sadness. I have no current obligations being neglected, and no reason to be upset, but this sudden emotion will be so poignant and repugnant so as to be uncomfortable.

Conversely, at the time of writing, I am in philosophy, a class in which my grade of an 'A' is secured, and I only attend out of respect for the professor and my grade. It only follows that I am bored out of my skull, and every morning I absolutely dread attending. So why, then, do I sit here positively elated? It is eight in the morning, I only had three hours of sleep, and yet I feel amazing. To complicate things further, I even took my Concerta today, which usually serves to make me feel like crap.

I understand that by their very definition, emotions are illogical, but this is absolutely absurd. There is no rhyme or reason to how I feel at any given moment. I'm getting tired of this.



O, profound coincidences! The topic of discussion in class just shifted to 'what makes you happy?'"

<blockquote>""[Y]ou shall hear from me the whole truth; not eloquence, gentlemen, like their own, decked out in fine words and phrases, not covered with ornaments; not at all &mdash; you shall hear things spoken anyhow in the words that first come. For I believe justice is in what I say.""
                                                                    --Socrates, at his trial</blockquote>

First day of school wasn't bad at all. I did wake up an hour late, but because I had actually planned to wake up an hour early it all canceled out (I refuse to believe that it is spelled canceled and not cancelled, but whatever).
My Philosophy professor Dr. Nguyen is a really funny guy, and an amazing teacher. He teaches through the Socratic Method (it's philosophy, duh) but he does so to such a degree that you end up rethinking anything you believe about the question. And it's only the first day.
The girl next to me, as sweet as she was in the beginning of the class &mdash; complimenting me on my shirt &mdash; was absolutely incensed when the teacher rejected her answer outright. She was muttering under her breath for a good minute. Then again, her answer was kind of pretentious and... of dubious quality.

Between classes, Elyssa Calhoun and I went to get our textbooks from the book store, and after she left for her Astronomy class, I relaxed in the cafe and transcribed all of my notes from philosophy into an outlining program that I found hidden in the depths of my mac.
I ended up recognizing this girl Kristyn whom I had met once before (in 8th or 9th grade...). She's a friend of Shannon and the gang, so she's a friend of mine. I sat next to her while she read, and ended up reading my philosophy assignment (10 solidly interesting pages) about 3 times. The author is absolutely brilliant.

<blockquote> ""'Know thyself' was inscribed over the Delphic oracle's temple. It was the first commandment of the god Apollo, who supposedly inspired the oracle (the 'Sybil,' a prophetess who spoke in the god's name). The second was 'nothing in excess.' These two commandments summed up the wisdom of Apollo.""
                                                                --Peter Kreeft, <u>Philosophy 101 by Socrates</u></blockquote>

It's nothing special, but it isn't dry and boring. Shut up, I like it.

After Kristyn and I parted ways, I went to my sociology class, where, while waiting outside, I was approached by Jose, an aerospace engineering major from Guatemala who lives off campus with his brothers. He had recognized me from our philosophy class, but it didn't go much further than that.
In class, I sit down next to a girl who kept dropping her pencil (I, of course, was gentleman enough to keep picking it up for her), and eventually just collapsed her desk and sent her stuff flying everywhere.
The girl behind me was giving her number to the girl sitting next to her, when her friend proclaimed ""Yeah, why not just tell everyone here!"" So, she finished her number a bit more quietly. Obviously, I turned around and asked her to 'repeat that last part.'

The class went off without a hitch, except once the professor didn't give us enough time to copy a slide. But with my new outlining software, I kept it all neat and organized. Hooray!

I've been walking so much lately that both of my achilles tendons are strained, and my legs feel like i've worked them out.

Which, incidentally, I am about to go do with Joey Amil.

So, I bid you adieu until next time.

It is a huge departure from... well, anything I have ever done in the history of ever.
It is one shot of Kitty Simmons that I particularly liked from the photo shoot Faron and I did to make the slide show for <i>""Short Skirt, Long Jacket""</i> by Cake.

I may put up a few more from the shoot, there are quite a few that I like (Kitty hates all of them, but nyah).

I have not taken any photographs in some time. I need to plan a trip to somewhere soon, even if it is just myself. I just am not able to bring myself to snap around my neighborhood. I tried a few times and nothing really worked for me."

We watched:

Ocean's 12
Wild Hogs
Grindhouse
The Reaping
The 40 Year Old Virgin
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby

Last night was prom.
Lots of pictures, stifling hot suits, and pretty dresses on prettier girls.
Rikki, looked great, as per usual.
I danced. For quite some time.

Then, IHOP. I had chocolate chip pancakes, and Rikki's bacon. :D


The most amusing part of the night?
Sarah K and Will M ballroom dancing to the rap music."

UF waitlisted me.
They don't expect to utilize the waitlist at all.
They tell me interviewing is futile.
They tell me that they won't accept transfers unless I have an A.A. (which takes 60 credit hours).


So the plan is:

I go to college. If I can transfer later, I transfer.
Anyways, I get my bachelors, I get my masters, and finally I get my doctorate.

Then, I change my name to Andrew Doom.

Then, it won't matter what I do, because damnit, i'm Dr. Doom."

I took 104, and kept 14. And I don't even like them much at all.



The lighting was bad, but that wasn't the issue. It'd be nice to have a larger aperture lens, but those are expensive as zooms. Very expensive. I might have to hunt down that 50mm f/1.4.

I couldn't find much within 2500 feet of my home that I wanted to take pictures of, so I forced myself on a few subjects. It was, for the most part, a disaster.

When I got home, I whipped out my camera, walked outside and, over the course of the day, shot about 150 pictures. (Of course, after cutting out the crap, I am left with about 50 something pictures, which is actually a really god percentage.)

It felt good. It was fun.
I shot ducks, I shot a baby egret, I shot trees, feathers, plants, flowers. I shot hawks, I shot sunsets. Hell, I shot dirt.

From this point forward, the camera <i>does not</i> get put away. It will sit on my desk, within arm's reach.
I figure that if the camera is accessible, I will actually use it instead of letting it be a very expensive way to fill a backpack.

I might post some pictures if there seems to be a point to it."

Conflict: Israel/Arabic Nations -- Holy Land

Bailiff: All rise, the honorable Judge Andy is presiding.

-all rise, I enter and sit at my judge bench pew beema thing-

Me: Alright, what seems to be the issue at hand?

Arab Nations (AN): He's a stinky poopy head and took our land and...

Israel (Il): No it was ours first! It's ours! See? -licks the land- Do you want it now?

AN: Hey! That's OUR holy land!

Il: Nyah!

Me: Quiet, both of you, or nobody gets the holy land and i'm turning this car right around!

-bailiff fastens his seat belt-

Me: Thank you. Anyways, you were saying?

Both: -noise pollution-

Me: (interrupting) one at a time. Arab Nations, you first.

AN: They're sitting on our holy land and we want it back!

Me: And you, Israel?

Il: It was our holy land. Is. Is our holy land. And they keep touching me and won't stay on their side of the car.

-Israel sticks out its tongue. The Arab Nations start crying-

Me: Decorum, please. Arab Nations, there is to be no crying in the courtroom/minivan. Israel, if you keep sticking your tongue out like that a seagull is going to snatch it.

-dramatic pause to regain composure-

Me: Now, Arab Nations first, what gives you the right to this land?

AN: A book.

-Israel snorts-

Me: Israel, is there something funny here?

Il: All they have is a silly book. WE have a SCROLL.

Me: And who, pray tell, wrote these deeds to this land in question?

Both: God.

Me: Oh? And where did this god sign it? Is there a by-line for proof, maybe a copyright stamp or a page where this god gives thanks? How about a bibliography in the dust jacket?

-silence-

Me: What proof do you have?

Both: They told us.

Me: They who?

Both, stammering: Th..They did.

Richard Dawkins: Your honor, as neither the defendant nor the plaintiff, whomever that may be, has actual proof that their god wrote those articles, I move that we strike both pieces of evidence from the record.

Me: Both articles have been stricken. Struck. Stroked.

-murmurs in the peanut gallery-

Me: Now, seeing as both parties no longer have any conclusive evidence giving them rights to the land in question, I hereby order all of those occupying it to evacuate within the next twenty four hours. The territory will be given to the Swiss as neutral ground, where they may do as they see fit, so long as what they see fit is to build a Disney Land. As for the holy land, both parties present are given visiting rights, along with an inaugural pass to the new Jerusalem Land good for one year. Israel, you can take your pick of one of the other countries, as long as its a small one. As for the country Israel chooses, all of its inhabitants may stay if they so choose, but they must play nice. If not, they may choose to ""move in"" with one country similar to their previous land, and add a hyphen between the names.

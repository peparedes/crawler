"event","In an interview with Katie Couric on CBS John McCain was asked about the surge - in a typical rambling answer filled with attacks and no policy/facts John McCain made a statement that was so BLATENTLY wrong and unfactual it made my head spin...

He claimed that Obama lied, and has no understanding of the events in Iraq while making the following statement... ""if it weren't for the Surge, the Sunni' ""awakening"" never would've happened, and the violence in Iraq never would've gone down..."".  Believe me when I tell you that every other sentence in this answer was an attack on Obama.

Heres the thing... the ""sunni' awakening"" happened MONTHS before there was even TALK of a surge, let alone additional troops sent to Iraq.

Heres the nasty part of this though... CBS did NOT AIR THIS RESPONSE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

they saw that McCain made a terrible mistake and they COVERED IT UP.  they aired a DIFFERENT RESPONSE to a DIFFERENT QUESTION in place of showing what an idiot McCain is.

THEY COVERED UP HIS IDIOCY WITH AN ANSWER THAT MADE HIM SEEM LIKE ANYTHING BUT THE MORON HE IS.... 

Time and time again McCain has proved that he has NO idea what the hell is going on in Iraq, and no concept of the history of this ""war"".  between his mistakes with the Iran/Al Qa'eda relationship, confusing Sunni' and Shi'ites, CONSTANTLY referring to Chekeslovakia - a country that NO LONGER EXISTS, and suddenly deciding that we've succeeded in Iraq, ""not are succeeding, but HAVE succeeded (an actual quote of McCain's) but we CAN'T pull the troops yet, because then the terrorists win!!!

I'M FUCKING SICK OF THIS BULLSHIT AND THE FUCKING MEDIA REFUSES TO COVER IT!!!!!! 

They'd rather talk about whether Obama is ""arrogant"" for, gasp, acting presidential while RUNNING FOR FUCKING PRESIDENT.  How the fuck else would you like him to act?!?! like Bush?!?!?!?!

so, to CNN, CBS, FAUX FOX FUCKING NEWS and even NBC:


FUCK YOU.


Keith Olberman is the ONLY reporter on TV who pointed this CBS cover up out.  how is this not front page national news everywhere?!?! this goes way beyond crossing the line of journalistic integrity... Imagine if a murderer was interviewed by Katie Couric... and Katie said ""did you kill those innocent 5 year olds?"" and the murdered said ""yes i did"".. now imagine if when this interview was aired on national tv, what you ACTUALLY saw was this, 'did you kill those innocent 5 year olds?"".... ""no no, of course not, i would never do that""... you would feel pretty cheated by that response, knowing the actual truth, wouldn't you? You would think, ""wow, these ""journalists"" have NO fucking integrity"", wouldn't you?

well guess what...
CBS HAS NO FUCKING INTEGRITY"

"event","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gas tax holiday proposed by U.S. presidential hopefuls John McCain and Hillary Clinton is viewed as a bad idea by many economists and has drawn unexpected support for Clinton rival Barack Obama, who also is opposed. 

ADVERTISEMENT
 
""Score one for Obama,"" wrote Greg Mankiw, a former chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. ""In light of the side effects associated with driving ... gasoline taxes should be higher than they are, not lower.""

Republican McCain and Democrat Clinton, who is battling Obama for their party's nomination, both want to suspend the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gas tax during the peak summer driving months to ease the pain of soaring gas prices. The tax is used to fund the Highway Trust Fund that builds and maintains roads and bridges.

Economists said that since refineries cannot increase their supply of gasoline in the space of a few summer months, lower prices will just boost demand and the benefits will flow to oil companies, not consumers.

""You are just going to push up the price of gas by almost the size of the tax cut,"" said Eric Toder, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington.

Obama criticized the plan as pure politics and said the only way to lower the price of gas is to use less oil.

""It would last for three months and it would save you on average half a tank of gas, $25 to $30. That's what Senator Clinton and Senator McCain are proposing to deal with the gas crisis,"" he said on Tuesday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

""This isn't an idea designed to get you through the summer, it's an idea designed to get them through an election.""

This stance has prompted Clinton to accuse him of being out of touch with ordinary Americans as she campaigns ahead of key presidential nomination contests in North Carolina and Indiana on May 6.




THANK YOU!!!

Since clinton and mccain announced their gas-tax-holiday crap this is exactly what I've been saying!!  Clinton's plan is at least marginally better than mccain, because she has a way to make up the lost money from the Highway Trust Fund, and McCain hasn't even thought of the ramifications of cutting that funding.. but either way, both of their plans essentially SUCK!  I'm sorry, but saving me 20 bucks this summer is NOT going to solve the gas crisis.  And its certainly NOT going to cause the oil companies to lower the price of an oil barrell.  We need to get gas prices nearly 3 dollars a gallon lower than it is right now, not 18 friggin' cents!  and cutting out the tax from the consumer does NOT affect the refineries in any way, they still charge the exact same amount for gas whether the federal (or state?) govt. taxes it or not... they're still selling it for the same price.  We need to attack the oil companies DIRECTLY and FORCE THEM to HAVE to lower the price...  and, of course, the easist, simplest (and fucking hardest) way would be to cut back on our oil dependency as a country.. but i mean, obviously much easier said than done..."

"event","The United States attacked a ""known terrorist target"" with precision missiles in southern Somalia on Monday, a U.S. military official said.

The strike near Dhoobley, which is close to the Kenyan border, was aimed at a ""facility where there were known terrorists"" affiliated with East African al Qaeda operations, according to the official.

The strike destroyed two houses -- killing three women and three children, and wounding another 20 people -- Dhoobley's District Commissioner Ali Nur Ali Dherre told CNN. Dherre said the remains of the missiles were marked ""US K."" 

The U.S. military official said the United States is still collecting post-strike information and is not yet able to confirm any casualties. 

He described Monday's strike as ""very deliberate"" and said forces tried to use caution to avoid hitting civilians.

Villagers have fled in fear of another strike, Dherre said. 





How can anybody support the war or our current administration when shit like this happens so often???  This is absolutely appalling.  clearly those women and children were ""known terrorists"".  This is why I have no problem with Michelle Obama saying that she isn't proud to be an american, and hasn't been for nearly 8 years now.  Who can be proud of being a part of a country that acts like this???"

I'm not gay, but all this anti-gay marriage bullshit really pisses me off.

FOR ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING REASON OTHER THAN THAT THEY ARE HOMOPHOBIC.  In every article i've read about it, every single conservative prejudice asshole who comments has nothing to say other than, basically ""its against the law"".  Ok, thats why we have a thing called AMENDMENTS.  Its fucking pathetic, it really is.  When two people love eachother, thats IT.  If they're living together as a family, why shouldnt they be entitled to all the same rights as a married couple?  what is a marriage other than two people basically legally sharing the same income??  For the life of me, i just cant figure out what basis anyone would have for disallowing gay marriages other than that they're scared pathetic prejudice closed-minded god-fearing homophobes.  If god is supposed to reward people who lead a ""good, sin free life"", who REALLY is more likely to go to hell??? two men or women that love eachother, and live a quiet life with their family, or the above mentioned JUDGEMENTAL conservatives, who want to inhibit the rights of others because they can't accept something they feel is ""gross"".  I think surgery is pretty gross, but i'm not going to try and prevent it from happening.  It's times like these I'm glad that I'm an atheist, because at least I have this thing called ""free thought"" and another thing called ""morals"".... which are far better than those any ""god"" could instill in me.

So, face intact, I'm walking down a boardwalk with some other dude and two women (we're all in our late 30's I'd say).  for whatever reason (its a dream, i can't justify whats going on) theres just a ton of fucking people out on the beach, and the woman i was with is now on the other side of all these people, most of whom are laid out upon the sand, presumably sunbathing.  And Im trying to make it through this maze of bodies, and then i realize im being chased, and we're all being chased.  This late 30's'ish year old dude with blond hair and an accent of some sort... english.  We make it across this beach, and into this building, then a room.  This blond dude crashes through the window, and grabs hold of the woman, and asks her some question i couldn't understand.  Some piece of information he was trying to gather.  I heard her say ""Boston"", and him say ""thats not enough"".  I guess he was trying to find out the location of something.... I said to him ""she just told you what you wanna know, whats the problem!"" and he turned towards me.  He had these razor blade type things, and grabbed my left hand.  He put it on the left side of the window he'd just crashed through, pinky pushed down against a jag of glass, and a razor blade pressed towards my index finger, essentially my hand trapped by sharp things.  He then turned back towards the woman.  The moment i struggled the slightest bit he pushed the razor down against my index finger.  The woman echoed my past sentiments, saying ""I told you what i know"" and he threw a razor type thing at her, gashing her cheek.  As he did that i took a swing at him with my right hand, and he pushed down further, fucking up my left hand pretty good.  

Then i woke up, thinking, ""well, this dream just took a turn for the stupid, and i want nothing to do with that anymore"".  there it is......


I just reread that and realized how little sense it made, but then, this is more for me than you.... but i assume someone will have something humorous to say, no doubt."

"event","so, tuesday mornin' i left for new paltz, got there around noonish.  we promptly hit a deli and made our way to boston.  finally got there around 5:30ish.  yeesh, talk about fuckin' cold.  pretty much eliminated all chance of a lot scene.  it was basically bar and grille type boston pubs.  so we found one, got some grub and eventually made our way into the fleet center.  lemme state that the fleet center is a pretty miserable venue.  although our section was clear, i heard some horror stories about security, and just getting into the venue was such a stupid hastle... it seemed like they were way underprepared, despite the fact that phish and other bands have played the fleet before.  in other words, they've put on freakin' rock concerts before!!  

so basically, seeing as this was the 20th anniversary show, it was quite hyped by everyone including myself.  and that makes me guilty, just like all (three) of you.  I was disappointed, but it was my own fault.  Because as i listen to it now, i realize, it was a pretty good show.  it didn't live up to the hype, no doubt, but again, if we put such high demands on this band, its only plausible that they don't live up to em'.  and despite the fact that i felt it was more like ""2 first sets"" as opposed to the normal flow of a show, i couldn't argue with the song choices, and got to hear some of my favorite songs, including ""wedge"" which i'd never heard live before (took 16 shows.... i read a review of some dude who said that was his first wedge after 54 shows!).  all in all, boston was a damn fucking good time, and theres still no place id rather be than a phish show (except in the bed of some fine ass woman.... at a phish show).

the highlight of the show, however, was definitely a 20(ish) minute video retrospective they played between sets.  started off with them rehearsing in a dorm room in 1985 (FLUFFHEAD!!) and progressed through their whole career, spanning everything, special guests, secret language (DOH) albums, playing on a hillside in front of 10 people to nye 02-03, the grand return at a sold out msg.  the whole thing was put together spectacularly, and i smiled ear to ear the whole time.  fantastic.  was worth my 40 bucks right there.

show ended at midnite, we got out of the parking lot by 1ish, and were back in new paltz by 4:45ish.... asleep at 5am, and up at a quarter to 9am.  i was on the road at 9, and got back to long island at 11 oclock.  napped for a half hour, showered and was in class at 12:50 (well, ok, 1pm... a lil' late) and finished off the rest of the week.

and thats the tooth!"

"event","so, in my marketing class, basically all we do is talk.  its great, because im always real vocal (im a very opionated person) and love ""debating"" with people.  today  however, i was just downright insulted, and i went off on this kid....

we were talking about religion, and i mentioned that I'm an atheist.  This one kid goes ""you mean you don't believe in god???? what a terrible way to live your life"" and someone else echoed ""yeah, that must be horrible"".

I was fucking livid.  I didn't even go off on the kid right away, i just said ""what makes it so terrible?  I'm enjoying my life"".  He said ""if you dont' believe in god, where are you gonna go when you die??"" so i said ""umm, 6 feet under, like everyone else"".  and he's like ""no heaven? hell?? whats the point??"".  

I'm not living my life to make sure that my ""afterlife"" is spent in a magical land with elves, candy canes and lolipops on gumdrop lane.  He said ""so you have like, no moral or ethical code to live by?"" and i said ""Thats exactly it, i don't need to live in fear of the invisible man to live a decent life.  Of course i have morals I live by, i just don't need to be scared into living a ""good"" life"".  The kid just didnt' get what i was getting at and kept saying how horrible my life must be.  Finally he was just like, ""well, i DO believe in god, and i don't want to hear about it if you don't"".  that was when i went off on the kid.  So because i believe something different than you, im not allowed to have an opinion?  and just because you're scared of what i have to say, my life is terrible im going to ""hell"" and you won't even HEAR it.  

This closed-mindedness is what bothers me the most about these uptight religious types.  It was either his way, or shut the fuck up.  Does that sound completely ridiculous to anyone else, or is it just me?  This fucking kid said I live a terrible life, and then wouldnt' listen when i tried to defend myself!!  

I guess its real easy to be blindly lead when you refuse to hear anything but what you want to hear.

My question for him is, who's really leading the terrible life?"

* this whole mepham ordeal has me REALLY angry.  Essentially the message thats been sent out to the rest of the world is this:  Hey kids, wanna commit horrible crimes and get away with it?  This whole thing is pathetic.  We were all kids in highschool, and we all know damn well that those kids new EXACTLY what they were doing.  But, instead, the coaches take all the blame, and the kids get a ruler to the wrist, when in reality, the kids should spend the next 5-10 years in jail getting raped in all sorts of horrible ways.  These mepham players RAPED their teammates while the entire fucking team stood around either laughing clapping or holding the freshman down.  and NONE of them are gonna pay for it.  Instead the coaches, who had absolutely nothing to do with it go down in flames.  Sometimes our judicial system makes me scream.

* in the simpsons episode where homer buys lisa a pony, there is a scene where he falls asleep while driving, and dreams he's in this magical dream land where everything is pillows and beds.  Alf Clausen, the musical director for the simpsons, appropriately arranged this acoustic version of golden slumbers, and i never noticed it till now.  pretty cool

*  This friday night Common Rotation will be playing the Bitter End in NYC.  I demand all tri-state folk to come down.  There is a good chance I'm gonna sit in and play some mandolin with them.  In all the years they've existed, and I've been playing music, I've never once sat in with them, so its actually incredibly exciting, and really means a lot to me.  I've never performed on stage with my brother before, and it oughta be pretty cool : )  Plus, once the clock hits midnite, I will be 20 years of age.  Partying will ensue.

*  Stupid rain

*  My phish tickets for Nassau (11-28) Albany (12-01) and the 20th anniversary show in Boston (12-02) came in the mail today.  Phish mail order tickets always look so damn cool.  This tour didn't disappoint (now, if only i can say the same about the music!)  seriously though, im way excited, as usual.  I just can't get enough of this band.  The 20th anniversary show in Boston will be my 17th time seeing them.

*Through a friends FTP i just finished downloading a live beatles concert from august 1966.  Im gonna listen to it while i sleep.

*For my audio project I have to record and mix a song (at least 8 tracks).  We had to write proposals and get them approved.  For mine I said i was going to write a funk original with guitar drums bass sax mandolin keys and cd samples.  Im gonna play/program everything.  Imagination here we come!

*  Tonight was a bust, but Bill Craig and Mitch came through, and we hung out a while.  Watched this awful B-horror movie called ""Kathy's Curse"" and I loved every minute (i was awake) of it.  Im pretty damn exhausted though, and i've got class at 9:30 tomorree.  guess I oughta fill my eyes with dem golden slumbers.

* adam and matt (my brothers) were back in town all of the last week (they left this morning).  awesome.  im pissed i didn't get to see them play anywhere (work/rehearsals/32 gigs) but we still got to hang out alot; with jory, eric, brian, the usuals.  a splendid time was had by all.  they're coming back in early november, cause they're playing the bitter end on november 7th (friday).  im most likely going to be sitting in on mandolin which im way excited about.  In all the years of their exsistence, and me playing various instruments, i've never sat in.  i've always wanted to.  Added bonus is that when the clock hits midnite, and november 8th begins, it will be my 20th birthday.  almost there... almost there....

* i don't think i ever commented on the incredible game 7 (and entire series) between the yankees and the redsox last week.  From top to bottom, that was an entirely classic baseball series with an incredibly climactic ending.  Being a new yorker, and thusly a yankee fan (met fans aren't really ""new yorkers"" in my opinion... heh... suckers) i was obviously quite pleased, and screamed and went nuts, waking up the whole house.  The world series has been pretty great too.  exciting from a baseball fans perspective.  but, the yankee fan in me hopes they don't make the next two games exciting and just beat those damn fish.

* i've gotten a ton of new music recently.  The new ""the new deal"" album arrived at my house last week and its really fucking good. way different than anything else they've ever done, but still distinctly ""new deal"".  its shorter, actual songs, some with vocals even.  It ranges from having a very retro 70's-ish dance feel to down tempo jazz or whatever.  Really a great listen.  They also released an ep to go along with the album, but didn't really announce it or promote it.  i found it tucked away in the merch section of their website (no advertisement on the homepage) and its limited edition and yet to arrive at my house.  can't fucking wait...

* My friend interns at elektra records and yesterday surprised me by giving me ""live phish 17-20"".  a show from 98, two from 94 and one from 91.  Should be pretty cool (although, i already have the two from 94, they are audience recordings, so the sbd's will most certainly be fantastic).

* I also landed copies of ""The deepest end"" by govt. mule, and the newest live allman brother release, 7/3 and 7/5 1970 from the atlanta pop festival.  yay for new music!

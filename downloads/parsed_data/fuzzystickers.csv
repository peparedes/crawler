"event","this morning i woke up early. i'm so tired.. it's summer which means i'm not supposed to be up before 9!! hah well anyways, this morning we ran late and didn't get a good seat for majii's graduation because i wanted to get an iced latte, and because my dad wanted some madelines <3 and a coffee as well. my uncle and his dog tagged along, and then we spent 2 hours sitting around and listening to everyone get their certificate. it was pretty cool. :P majii didn't even know i was there though. shows how much i meant to him. lol i FINALLY got my magazine that i've been wanted for AGES. and it came, and now it's not as fun, because it's just filled with crap-ads and people who want you to buy their stuff. :I yeah... we went out to lunch at a sushi bar, and i got a bento box, once again <3 those things are so damn good. i ate all of my veggie tempura and it was so good. i fed my uncle's dog some chicken because I had nothing else to do. i finished the fairy book and it was awesome, i'm hoping to go to the library and pick up some more books :P pfft.. maybe today if my mom isn't too busy with her friend who is staying with us for the reunion tomorrow. mm yeah i forgot to mention that. meep is coming over for an overnight tomorrow, so we'll take pictures and it will be cool as fairy beans in a bag. 


in my room i found this awesome little glass jar, kinda like the one in beauty and the beast (the thing that covers the magic rose) it's got some mossy stuff and then some roses and mushrooms and a pretty butterfly *all fake of course* it's rather nice n___n I'll update this later maybe.
I'm so forking excited to go to the damn downtown with helie. I've got to get reading! :O Lol but it's been so much fun! I know what i'm going to get, we're gonna go to starbucks, barnes and noble, hot topic, records, and so many other places! we might even get BRUNCH because niether of us like breakfast! :P lol . But we changed the date for <b>WEDNESDAY, THE 11TH</b> and I can't wait for that! XDDD so remind me! lol I wont be on much that day because I'll just be having fun! I hope that it's nice weather, or that it's cool. it's alright if it's rainy.. just not POURING or else we'll have to stick inside of a shop, and we'll get all of our purchasee's wet. :O

"event","yes well nothing much to talk about today.. :O That book of mine that I got <b>I was a Teenage Fairy</b> has to be one of the best books I've ever read, I'm still reading it right now, BUT I'm like more than 1/2 way finished with it! :P Francesca Lia Block has got to be my most favorite author.. I just love the way she writes her stories! I'm probably going to go back to B&N with helie one of these days :D
I can't wait for <b>JUNE 18</b>!!! It's the day that helie and I are going to go downtown and chill out.. ya know? Hang out at barnes and noble and we're going to buy a book -cough-manga-cough- and then get some coffee and then just READ. It should be so much fun! :D I can't wait for that :) Then we'd go into hot topic and buy jelly bracelets and a HUGE carebear plushie (for mee) and I'd be sure to take pics or what not :I afterwards we'd go into these weird stores and we'd pick up clothes that we could just mess with, or something like that, and then we could maybe go get an iced latte at STARBUCKS.. :9 gosh, I wish that day was here. So from now until then, I've got to read like 10 books okay? :O You heard me say it, but my goal would be 15... :P I'll be keeping count later when I get home from the baseball game I'm going to. it doesn't seem that fun now. only gira, minnie, lilia and em are going. so it will be alright I guess. :O i'll edit this later.. I want some peach soda. <3"

We might be going into a thrift shop or something with what money we have. I need some new clothes that I can mess around with or something, or that I can just wear for fun! :p I'll have to take pictures if I get anything too :D

I should go get something to eat because i haven't eaten anything yet today.. so i will probably go get a bagel. :9 today i might read a little too.. i love to read, and i want to read a ton of books this summer. and write some of my own stories as well ;p it should be good fun. <3


<b>EDIT</b>: yes, well I did end up doing something fun :D I went to downtown with helie :D It was so much fun! :) We went to hot topic, and I saw these HUGE care bear plush pillows, and I'm going to go back and get one! :DD In 2 weeks, we're going to meet up and do it again because we had a blast today, and we also saw so many things that we wanted! :O Well anyways, we spent most of our time at <b>BARNES & NOBLE</b> and I REALLY wanted to get some manga, but they were like $10 each, and I still had to have money to ride back on the bus! :OO So yes, i didn't get any new mangas.. *cries* but I did get a very cool book! It's called:


<b>I was a teenage Fairy</b>

It was nice, I didn't feel very well though ( - - ) but it's not that bad. Then we also bought some socks because I needed more! haha. Majii always steals mine! XD Then we went to go and get some supplies at the grocery store, it was nice because I had to get more toothpaste, and I got some yummy ripple raspberry citrus lip gloss! :9 It's so fun and it smells great too! 

Then I came home and I've just been hanging out. I'm so stressed out for tests and things like that coming up. I'm actually more nervous for an oral in english, we have to memorize some lines and speak in front of the class. It's called twelfth night too! :OOO so I'm kinda blah, I don't understand.

I've got a lot of homework and I don't feel like doing anything.. just sitting around on this grand mothers day day! haha well we were going to pick some flowers from the yard, but we don't have any and they're too pretty to pick, so I was going to pick some from this bush, but our neighbors were outside, so they probably would be like ""ashdklajsd get the hell away from my BUSH!"" so that was just a NO. :X haha I'll update again later!"

We've got to work on a project ><;; and he said that we can only get an A+ if we know quadratic equations. :O Haha you think I'm going to know which TYPE he wants??!

I've got to push myself, but seriously I'm SO not in the mood. XD XD XD

Today was an alright day. I sat around and did nothing atall. First off I went and took a quiz first thing in the morning and no it wasn't that bad! :) I don't think that I failed it THAT much! haha then I went to the buses that were outside and sat with this kid.. we'll call him simon haha and I listened to my teacher's baby cry all the way there. It was clearly killing my head and I was like ""nooo please shut up"" but the baby is oh so cute. Then we went into class and we read our stories to the class... They weren't listening to me at all but I don't really care. Then we were dropped off at someplace and I went and got some flautas. I thought that they were going to my chewy and soft tortilla nibbles but they were crispy and fried, and they weren't that bad. We had to speak in spanish the whole time, and It was pretty cool I must admit! :) But I couldn't understand the waiter because he had a funny voice but he was oh so nice! We made everyone late because I had a sopapilla :9 it was very yummy with honey on it! <333 I'm going to draw one for my PIXEL ADOPTION later! <333 So please do be prepared. I went back into class and my teacher was like tapping her foot and waiting for an excuse or something. 

Then we're like banned from a part of the building since some dumb kids in our grades were like screwing around in the halls and so they ruined it for all of us. I'm so SICK and TIRED of stupid and IMMATURE kids in my class. They're not being fair to me, or to any of my friends! GRRRRRR! *glares*

I'm feeling excited, I want to order some stuff from Asia, but I'm really worried about the SARS deal. X( X( X( I'm looking at my empty box of hello pandas *stares* but it's all empty.

"event","*does a hula dance* Yay it's friday! :) I'm super duper excited-O.
AND super-duper bored! XD It's the weekend and I've got nothing to do! haha I feel like going SHOPPING or getting out and stuff, for once right now I don't want it to rain that much. Math class was hell today.. let me tell ya! I almost fell asleep there, and I would have gotten yelled at. Lmao. 

Anyways, when we auditioned for CH it wasn't that bad! :) I liked it at least.. haha I messed up though but I hope that I got in! :) I really want to get in. After working our butts off trying to get in it. XD Este told me that Ms. L said that we did a good job, so I take that as that we got into it! :D If we do we'll have to practice a lot! 

Gahh I've never been so bored.. well I guess that I have, but that's not important. None of my school friends are online, it makes me sad :( But I'll still be talking to other people. Today in spanish class I presented my story first! :D It made me really nervous, but I was just fine!! I'm so mad that other people are being so RUDE to my friend. She's a 8th grader and they like judge her on what she wears and stuff and it makes me really mad. Oh well. I wish that I could like be partners with her when we do work in the book or when we've got a project, but she hangs out with all of the other 8th graders :( I feel so left out, even the 7th grader is more popular than me. *whoops, I'm so stupid* 

Another banana tree down the drain! haha well I'm going to go now I'll be back on probably with helie. I hope that we can do something MUCHO fun this weekend!"

"event","Haha, well it's been a while since I've been here! XD haha :) Anyways, I'll tell you about my week so far. It's been good, I've been practicing with este, minni, bibi, gira and em. It's been fun, I'm REALLY REALLY NERVOUS for the presentations tomorrow, i've got 2 and I guess that you could say that I'm stressed! :D I got my book bound and you won't believe how much it costs! $45 to get it laminated and bound! :O :O Yes, it's crazy! well when I got home, I checked my mail and I was really bored. I looked at <a href=""http://www.teenpeople.com/teenpeople/2003/prom/dress_200_4.html"">PROM DRESSES</a> haha I think that would be so much fun to get a dress. I looked through some of them, and that was one of the dresses that I liked, but I don't think that I would wear it! XP XP XP 

Tomorrow we're trying out for CH, and I'm really really NERVOUS! I can't stop thinking about it, and that's what minnie told me to do.. but yeah I guess that it didn't work. My highlight of the day would be that my dad got me a free french fry coupon! :9 I feel like getting mangas XD I'm such a dork..."

"event","blah you don't know how sick of school I am! :( I hate it to cookie crumbs, I want it to be summer where I can relax! I'm sick of a lot of the people in my school. I don't know why but I'm sick of them. People in my class were so obsessed with like these orange shoes and they aren't 'rad' at all, and it makes me so grrr. o_O;; I mean I don't know... then there is this girl in my class and I swear that she's got something going on, she always like has a hissy fit over something that isn't a big deal. Like today someone sat down in her seat and then she started FLIPPING OUT and was like ""wtf!???????! That's my seeeeat! GET OUT! GET OUT!"" god it made me crazy. Then when i was walking up to the desk I knocked her desk with my foot and then I tripped *on accident* and then she stared at me and like gave me this glare like ""ooh you need to apologize"" i was just like haha hell no. 

Anyways today wasn't that bad. In science we were doing stuff with bacteria and I swear that I was like infected with it. XD haha greeeat, now I'm sick! Actually I'm not, but yeah. Blah, I'm hella tired! x_X I need to finish my story and everything, and so that might be a problema... I want to go to sleep but I think that I might just be lazy and not do it. This thursday I'm presenting my story in front of the class, :D I won't bring my glasses for that, that way I can't see anything lmao :D 

Today we practiced for CH and I'm really nervous all of the teachers are judging.. o_O are you serious? and I'm really nervous, I think that I'll mess everything up! Eeep!! tomorrow we're learning a new dance and I think that it might be okay, just really HARD! We're going in early tomorrow morning AND I need to make myself a yummy smoothie too! :D It would be so good! Do you know what I""m talking about!? Then I'll bring my own lunchum it should be dandy as candy fun. I wish that it would be lighter out But I don't think that it will be because it's probably going to rain. The highlight of my day!"

Alright okay no, I have no clue about what I'm going to wear. :P This isn't going to go over well at 6 tomorrow morning is it? lmao :D I need to go shopping.

bored... took a CHEESE quiz

<img src=""http://cupped-expressions.net/cheese/quiz/chevres01.gif"">
<B>chevres</b> BWHAHAH you know it!

You are a cheese of different shapes, sizes, and textures. You are dependable, generous, and modest. You want to please everyone, but sometimes you have trouble remembering yourself.

These cheeses are made from goat's milk. They come in many sizes and shapes, such as round patties, log-shapes, drum-shapes, pyramids, round loaves, long loaves etc.; their textures vary from soft, but firm like cream cheese to extremely hard. Chevres are excellent dessert cheeses, often served as snacks or before dinner drinks. Goat cheese is often served as an ingredient in many fine dishes. [ Country: France || Milk: goat milk || Texture: semi-hard ] Thanks to <a href=""http://cupped-expressions.net/cheese/quiz"">THIS</a> place!!


OH YES BTW <b>LET ME KNOW IF I SHOULD MAKE MY JOURNAL FRIENDS ONLY</b> Thanks mucho! ^_~"

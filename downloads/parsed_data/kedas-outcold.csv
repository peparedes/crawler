"event","so i haven't written in a while... a long while, but i'm gonna start writing in it more often. i know it seems to most people that i'm just a dumb jock... and i even let people convince me of that. i had a teacher tell me that the other day and it kinda hit me... i'm not a dumb jock. dumb jocks don't care about anything, except for sports... i care about sports, but not more than anything. i don't go for the chearleader type, because they suck. i went for the girl that has something going for her... i went for the girl that made me melt inside when she looked into my eyes... and i have grown to love her more than anything on this earth. tell me about a ""dumb jock"" you know that would give anything for the girl they care about more than anything. who writes peotry out of the blue because they can;t get that girl out of their head. tell me about one that has cried themself to sleep because of that girl... but not because they were sad, but because they realized that they have someone that would pick them up when they were down, and take them in when they were cold. tell me about one that could last a lifetime, holding that girl, and never wanting to let go. if you can tell me about a ""dumb jock"" that meets all of that, then i'll call myself a dumb jock. but until then, i'm not a dumb jock, i'm who i am, no matter what you call me, i know who i am and what i stand up for, and i have someone that loves me no matter who i am. so like i said, call me what you want... it wont affect me!

"event","i haven't written in here in a while, so i figured that i'd update it...

spring break was alright. spent pretty much all week with ZITO. would have spent it with my babi, but she was in Fla. kinda sucked, but i made the best of it. i think i spent all but three total nights at Paul's house...

thursday after my banquet for basketball, i went over to Janine's house, had an awesome time before she left. I love being able to tell her everything, and just hold her. it's awesome. then friday i ordered my pipes for my truck, and the lid for the bed of it. that was pretty sweet. 

i spent most of the weekend following up in port huron spending time with Grandma Kendrick, and the rest of the family. it's good to see her in such a joyful mood even though the cancer is getting worse. ""gotta make the best of it""  anyways so the rest of the week i went to paul's house and almost everynight went to taco bell at about two. then we'd mess around and shoot hoops or something. it was pretty fun. 

honestly the best part of my week was talking on the phone late at night or early in the morning to my babi. It brightened each and every day. friday night i went to element at church, that was pretty fun. i tied with Jeff James for the milk drinking game, that was pretty sweet. the only bad thing about that night, is that people blew things out of proportion, and twisted some stuff, which makes me look bad, but truth be told, i'm completely honest to Janine. I don't look at any other girl the way i look at her, because she is my only one. how could i? but now that i got that out, the rest of the night was pretty cool. and yet again i went crazy playing dodgeball. it was pretty sweet.

saturday once Janine was home, i went there and had yet another great night. Being with her makes all my fears, and pains go away. :-) (-: I love you beautiful.

so yeah, sunday rolled around and i had my first day of real work. it was pretty cool. all the guys are sweet, and my boss brad is pretty much a kid at heart. so i think i will enjoy this job.

but yeah that was my break, and i had fun for the most part, but i know it could've been better. oh well, now that school is back in, i plan on improving all my grades... but it's gonna take some work, anyways, i'm out i'll prollly write again tomorrow. later

"event","Yesterday was seven months for me and Janine! All i could do was think about her and couldn't concentrate on anything but being with her. we pulled into her drive way at the same time, and i couldn't have turned my car off any faster to jump out. i know i sound like a little kid before he goes to chucky cheese's, but it just excites me when i get to see her, and i couldnt wait any longer. I honestly have grown happier and happier ever since the first day we started our relationship. I absolutely love the time we spend together, no matter what it is. just being next to her, holding her, talking to her or just looking at her makes me feel like i have never felt before. I love it. it doesnt matter to me what the outside world thinks about any of it because i am happy. I can't explain how much she means to me.
    I've been made fun of for the poems i write, for the way i talk about how happy i am, because of her, even for having a journal where i keep those poems at, but you know what, if you want to make fun of what i have, go for it, it doesn't bother me. wanna know why? because for the first time in my life, the word LOVE means more than that, it also means a friendship, happiness, being cared for, caring for her, and compassion. so say what you want, i don't care! When i say ""I Love Her"" i mean all three words!

                                 I LOVE YOU JANINE


""Love is.....remembering the past, looking forward to the future, but enjoying the present!""

"event","they say 3-6 months, but do they truly know
they cant control it based on what's in show
do THEY think THEY can control time
can these doctors ever make up their mind?
i dont believe that when they say it
because they've been proven wrong before
they said 3-6 months and it turned into 2yrs. more
it happened to a past loved one, of my loved one i love now
because she had fight in her, and to that inner drive i bow
in the time that has been spent, to touch so many
the two remind me of one another, they both did and have done plenty!
both doctor's said it'd be 3-6, and a year or two can pass
but no matter what comes out of this, on the other side it's greener grass!

i know i did not know her, but hearing about the adventures and the Drive for life she had makes me feel like there is hope, and she has become an inspiration to me. I only wish that i could have met her.

"event","i woke up with the biggest smile on my face today... after a not so good night at conferences, Janine, like always, made me feel alot better. so i fell asleep thinking about how awesome she makes me feel. 

then i had this amazing dream, we went on vacation together, but it was just the two of us. it was somewhere south, warm of course! but the dream was weird (in a cool way). it was like little 5-10 minute ""clips"". i dunno, but we went to some big theme park, and left there with like ten huge stuffed animals, then we went para-sailing, and we went out over the ocean, it was sweet. but my favorite one was when we were out on that peer. it was like the long one that is in myrtle beach. and we ate dinner on it, then we were watchin the dolphins until it started to get dark. The we watched the most beautiful sunset ever, and i know it was a dream but it seemed so real. and then, well i'll leave the last part out and leave you guessing. but it was an amazing dream! I hope it all comes true... especially the last part.

"event","today started out alright, woke up, had a hot shower, normally makes me feel good in the morning. i'm on my way to school and everything seems to be alright. at school first through fifth hour were fine... then i checked my e-mail while in Gym (we were in the library doing homework), and it is a message from an old friend of mine's email... but it wasn't him, it was his mother... my friend John, who moved to tennessee between sixth and seventh grade was shot and killed out side of his dads resteraunt. she told me that he had written me a letter yesterday before heading over to Hydroscope (his dads resteraunt).

it said, ""Dear Kent, i know it has been a while since we have connected, but i had been thinkin about you for the past couple days. I am still with my girlfriend Jackson, she's doin good...."" (later in the letter) ""...i know this is out of nowhere, but i have to tell you this because this has been trying to come out since sixth grade, but i just found the words i should use today. so here i go, Kent you truly were my friend, ever since Todd Kern tried to beat me up in third grade, and you were the only one to stick up for me. i was ""the new kid at school, and you took me under your wing. after my first day of school i went home as happy as i had ever been and told my mom, that i had found a friend. she was so happy for me. you were honestly the first kid that ever accepted me, mainly because i was a little over weight. i know this makes me sound like a lil girl, but i thought i should tell you. you truly were an inspiration to me. after i built some , for lack of a better word, braveness from the friendship you gave me, you helped me pick up my chin and walk with confidence. leading me to new friendships, although not nearly as good as ours, and also encouraging me through thick and thin, ""rough and tough"" (lol i miss the old days) situations. Thank you so much bro, i miss you and i hope we can connect this summer. later man. sincerely, your friend John""

after i finished reading that i was so choked up i couldn't even tell people what was wrong. i hurt inside. you will be missed John! love you man!

then we went back to her house to hang out til my dad picked me up. i love holding her. thats the best part about our relationship, knowing that we are content with just being with eachother, and holding eachother. i love it.
once i got home, it kinda sucked though. cuz i wanted to be with my baby, but i had to be at my house. and i found out what was bugging her, and it made me feel like i had done something wrong. and i know i said it, but i need you to know Janine, i would never hurt you. i care too much about you to do that, and i would be hurting myself as well. there is no-one else!

the main thing that most people dont know about me is that i'm adopted. and its not a regular adoption... i know my birth mother, Erin, and i have since birth. of course i look at her more as a friend, but i love her just the same. i plan on meeting my birth father, but it's been hard for me to actually take the final step to do so. i have support, mainly from Erin and my girlfriend, my mom too, but i'm kinda sketchy about what my dad thinks. he says it's cool, but it still seems like there is something wrong about it to him, but i dont want to bring it up with him.

i play football, and basketball for my school. i did play baseball, but a certain coach sorta killed it for me. so hey whatever takin this year off. my favorite sport is what most consider a hobby. Snowboarding is my anti-drug!! hahaha... sorry inside joke. my best sport as well. but when it comes to school sports football is definately my favorite, and best.

i saved the best for last. my girlfriend Janine!! she has been the most inspirational person in my life. being the first person i have ever truly loved (outside of family) she is the one person i can truly count on for everything. there is a quote that i heard a while before our relationship started, and it finally hit me when i realized she is the perfect example... ""when someone can make a bad day good and a worse day better, then they truly are special!"" Bill Cosby. it is true, she can make the worst day better for me. I Love You Janine!

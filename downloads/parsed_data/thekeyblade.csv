This journal is <b>FRIENDS ONLY</b>. This is specifically my place to write down my thoughts on topics that happen to be on my mind, past memories, and my poetry and such. It's rather personal, and thus why most people will not be permitted to read them. Please do not feel offended if you're not on the friend's list. 

However, if you want to view my normal day to day journal, then please just follow the link below:

"event","I should really find a better time to update than the mornings, but meh, whacha gonna do.  

Displeased with school, as usual, as we got our French marks yesterday.  I was beginning to enjoy myself because I thought I was on the rebound, doing considerably better than the first couple of weeks.  Granted, i think I am, but it hasn't amounted to anything, ...I'm getting 88.7.  That's 10% off from where I need to be, obviously.  Needless to say I'm feeling flustered and frustrated.  It's also quite sad that in both Bio/French I'm getting such horrid marks because I'm so flaky!  It's not like I don't try to do my work or I don't care, it's the opposite, I care so much!  Yet I always forget things, leave stuff behind, etc.  Bah.  I'm pretty convinced that Bio is around 84~88 now, after the test, depending on how she weighs it.  I rely on tests for good marks, I do well on those and SHIT in regular assignments (other than projects).  History is...OK, I don't think I can ask for much more, I've tried my hardest and there's been some results.  Asif is slightly ahead of me, but no one else deserves it more, cept maybe Alice.  Maybe 95~96?  Math...a lot better than I thought.  I was so happy that I'm understanding conics, more or less.  And it was actually interesting!  YAY!  I thought I'd fail the last one, get maybe like...72~82, but I got 93, yay :).  Need 98, but that's ok.  Next time.  Spanish is, well, no complaints there either, other than my stupid mistakes.  I think I'm getting 97~98, not sure.  Must work harder!

PSAT was yesterday...damn it was a BITCH!!  Critical reading wasn't any harder/easier than I thought it would be, but in retrospect, I made a couple of mistake by second-guessing.  Don't think I did badly nor phenominally there.  Math was easier than I thought, but I made a couple of stupid mistakes...like not beign overly clear with the question and getting the right answer....but filling out the answer sheet wrong.  OMG.  But there wasn't very much time for checking answers, maybe 2 minutes max.  Writing was HELL...so difficult!  I'm lucky if I had less than 10 mistakes!  It's just so impossible because I've never learnt formal grammar, I go by what sounds good to my ears, more or less.  Must practice!  All this was compounded by the stress of the situationa dn the time limit, sooo...blah ><.  Math was probably ""ok"" but not great, writing sucked.  PSAT added so much unnecessary stress though, I'm still sort of reelign from it, but I'm glad it's over.  What will I be like when the real deal comes around?  Heh.  

Last rant.  This place is so disappointing when it comes to decent men.  I don't know why I bother sometimes.  It's so disturbing/disgusting to get 56 y/os messaging me telling me I have nice legs.  Oh god.  I may like older guys....but not double my age!!!  WTF.  :|And any normal people I try to talk to never reply.  Was reading Fabian's journal though (what else do you do at 6:30am?), it's sorta ironic that he's trying to get Tyler to tell him something, because he's concerened and he cares...yet it's something he resented other people doing.  Probably a different situation, who knows.

Did I tell you about how I saw Niels?  He is as good looking as ever, but less blond.  Ater talking with him though, turns out he's not as phenominal as thought, academically anyway.  He only got a 28 for his Dip.  I'm aiming for a 40.  Of course, 40 is impossible (here's hoping!), but I mean...I have confidence in at least getting 33~35, I think.  He's now at UVic.  Though, heh, he IS in the nationals for badminton...!

By the way, Operation Box commences Friday.  Mahaha.

"event","Ok, I have to rant, otherwise I'll burst.  I'm NEVER promising to go to a tournament ever again before knowing the full details - even if it's Dylan in desperate need of a partner.  First things first - we didn't know 2 weeks ago that it was going to be the day right after Alice's surprise party, I'll give it that much.  Who knew that I wouldn't go to bed till 12:30?  But what I didn't know when I promised him was that I'd have to be there at 8AM.  In Richmond.  Meaning I leave here before 7:15, earlier than school.  Yes, the same weekend where I planned to catch up on sleep.  Nor did I know that it would be the most expensive tournament I've been to...$32 for ONE event.  Usually that gets me 2 or 3 events!!!  Greedy bastards!  What's more, I have to play with Dylan in U19.  Oh good god.  We wouldn't have much of a chance in U16, well, maybe like...3rd or consolation winner...maybe not even that.  We barely ever play doubles together seriously, and NEITHER of us are at a level that's sufficient to gain any standing at a tournament together.  Other thing:  damn the organisers.  When I was checking the draws I thought they weren't posted - because in the little tabs on the bottom they forgot to write U19 Boys Doubles, and put U19BS twice.  Then even when I found it, our names were the only ones tucked away and hard to see.  Oh, and our first match...it's against Terrence, the guy that looked dumbed but kicked my ass last time at Douglas.  I can only presume his partner is at the same skill level.  We'll have gotten up at 6 just to pay $32, play 2 short games, and go home.  I hope it doesn't take long either...there are SO many entries, god knows how long it will take!  We'll be stuck there for AT LEAST 4 hours just for our two matches, if not more.  Experience dictates more.  Oh, and BAHAH even if we win the first match...the second match would be agaisnt NIELS.  Hmmmmmm strange much?  Playing with my ex against the guy I really liked.  Apart from that, Niels is utterly awesome.  He could destroy the two of us by himself.  Lovely, we can go and give him another ego boost.  I recognise all the names in U19BD, and it's not a good thing, it's the usual crowd of Surrey guys and Maple Ridge....*sigh*.  Even that annoying Matt kid will be there.  Must go change and eat breakfast now, enough ranting for this morning.  

Later I'll talk about Alice's party, lol what a hoot!  Twas so much fun, though I wish I were sleeping right now...waking up was ever so painful.  I wanted to stab my alarm clock, and then Dilly :|

Anyway.  Random things on my mind right now, ""She Will Be Loved"" is so pretty, heh.  A lot of things I want to say, but I must sleep soon.  Two tests tomorrow, though the Spanish isn't such a big deal.  Math...doen and over with, I'm so glad!  but I know I did pretty poorly.  If only I could ahve Spanish registered - what wonders it would do for my GPA!!!  And Ms. Korby is so nice...she always compliments me, hehe.  And it's a constructive use of my block 3, I love the Spanish language!  Can't say the same for French at the moment...I still love French, but the class is difficult ...not in ways I'd like it to be.  Hoping I'm still in that ""beginning slump"" everyone is in.  And that form a lot of people got intrigues me...but I'm not so obssessed about it like Terrence is.  I'd like to know still, hmm.  terrence has revealed a lot about school politics, and it's a little frightening.  However, he had a lot of kind words for me, and perspectives I neevr thought about before.  ""Golden Child of the Humanities"", ha.  Maybe if I continue to be top student...hmm, I'd be the only one EVER from PMMS to be top...and be in arts instead of sciences.  I like that prospect.  This week is comign to an end, thankfully.  Sleep now..another day yet!  Other things on my mind, ...but let's not think about that.  It shouldn't be a priority, Mary and Alice are right.  Oh, on anotehr topic - I've been blocked from going to Symposium this year.  I don't know if it was entirely intentional, or done conveniently with secodnary issues in mind, done with subconscious intentions, or with no inbtentiosn at all.  Probably the first two, unfortuantely.  Ha, what am I to do when my best friend is against me?

"event","I really should be finishing up my French and not doing this, but that's OK, it's not like I'm awake enough yet to do a good job of it.  In fact, I'm not awake - ever.  Every morning feels like a constant struggle because I barely scrape off 6 hours of sleep a night.  5~6 hours is the norm for me, and it is truly painful.  It sounds wimpy and whiny that I'm complaining about sleep, but I'm finding myself really irritable and cranky lately - and reallly frustrated with school.  Weekends aren't really breaks, just blocks of time where I can ty and catch up on accumulated work.  It's only been 3 weeks in and I feel like I've been here forever, feels like someone has smashed my body with a hammer like so much tenderised Bahamian conch.  I'm so stressed mostly from French and math...French because gettign a god mark in that class is near impossible with Jordhen's poilicies,, and that Bogdan/Min Jung/Jessa are actually doing well.  Even Mary's faring better than me...it's not any shame to be behind her, no, but...I don't know, deep down I believe my abilities in French matches, if not tops her.  Sounds egotistical and stupid, I know, but...whatever.  I know my stuff in a lot of subjects - but I have such trouble obtaining good marks this year!  It feels like every little human error accounts for a big chunk of lost marks, and that stresses me out quite a bit too.  And math?  I don't get it...just plain don't understand.  I pretty much get it up to reciprocals, then it stops.  And I make sooo many random mistakes because I'm trying to do it mechanically and I don't always understand the concepts, bah.  The sad thing is that chapter one is supposed to be the easiest chapter ever.  Oh good lord, what's to come?  Bio's not going well, I've gotten like...10/15, 8/10, all that crap.  WHY?  I know my stuff as well as anyone else, I try as hard, but nooo the webpage doesn't load for me that one time and I'm frikkin screwed.  I honestly hope I'm worrying for nothign and all these dents in my grade turn out to be like .5% or something.  And I hope I can last...it doesn't feel like I can.  Already my body is telling me I need a week off to unwind, ...either that or it's just because I'm sick.  Oh yeah, because of everything that's been going on and me being sick, I haven't been to cross-country in 2 weeks.  Fuck.  On the flip side, I did win the elections yesterday...it was only because my speech was done in a different format though, that made a huge difference.  As well, the two gr. 12s split their own votes, and I knew more gr. 12s than they knew gr. 11s.  Whee.  I must learn to do better time management.  I don't actually consider this wastign my time because if I don't vent like I do here, it is likely that my head would explode.  But goals to come: set up schedules for my days.  Ohh, and as much as I hate to say it, dependign on how it goes...I might have to drop Spanish.  If school gets too stressful for me, I might want that period back fro unwinding a bit during the day.  Because right now, I go through every single day 7:30am~4:30pm without any breaks, rests, not even five minutes.  4:30 is because every day there seems to be soemthign after school.  Help me...what am I to do?  Or are my two remainign years to be like this, a constant struggle for health and knowledge?  DAMN I hate math.  Do French now.  Bye."

"event","Wow, things turned dark and cloudy quickly...and I'm not talking about the weather!  It's actually still clear outside and will be another spectacular autumn day tomorrow, feels almost like an Indian summer but for the breeze.  I think (or know?) I'm sick again...my throat is starting to feel really irritated and I'm getting very cranky.  Why?  Is this the fifth or sixth time I've had a cold in this year alone?  Just finished up my SS notes so I can write the story for the project tomorrow.  I didn't finish the tasks I outlined for myself today - couldn't do Spanish ...NO ONE KNOWS THE CRITERIA!  I can't do it when I don't even know the measurements, amounts or writing/pix, etc.  Newspaper article will have to wait till tomorrow too.  The price of not being in class and going out durign the day I suppose.  

Jerked awake to answer the phone around 9:30, SHARE called to say Mark wasn't part of SHARE anymore.  Whoo, whatever, we have a plan B.  Went back to sleep until 10:50, then woke up and chatted with Mary for a while.  Got convinced by her to go out and do work later, damn her, hehe.  Got dressed and read a bit till 12:30 or so when she picked me up...she drove the car out to Lougheed, not bad!  Saw Jamie Walker and Ju on the platform, I see Jamie everywhere!!  Was a nice ride out there, and great weather too, breezy/crispy...yet sunny and bright.  Perfect fall weather isn't it?  Was a really pretty dude on the train, looked very lost though.  Poor thing.  

Got off and Granville and did the standard route out towards English Bay...Granville->Robson->Denman.  It was great fun just cahtting about the most random things, with a heavy emphasis on Senior Sail and Les Etoiles de Mer.  Didn't spot anything particularly interesting...though Mary kept takign random pictures for no reason.  Had lunch at Milestone's...mmm Thai Chiecken Wrap thing with curly fries and iced tea!  Mary got the Californian burger and Caesar.  Talked a lot more, and the waitress was very nice.  It was just so relaxign to be out in the heart of Vancouver, ...I couldn't be happier to live in my hometown.  Adopted hometown anyway.  It's just something about the place..I can't explain it, it's the essence of the vibrant life of Vancouver, the multiculturalism, the glamour and beauty, natural settings, easy going style, friendliness, prosperous...I don't know.  heh.  

Walked down to English Bay and just relaxed.  Ran around at the edge of the water and dug up shells and such.  tried to clear the lue layer off this one mussel shell..it's impossible!  Sat around the logs and read the Georgia Strait, fooled around, admired the boats off in the distance...the sun was real nice.  Mary continued to take random pix...haha.  Then by 5 we walked down Davie and took the train home from Burrard.  Dad drove us home, we went out to dinner at China Palace, went to coq Cen for poster baord...here I am now, after homework.  

Back to Senior Sail...

Honestly speaking, things got to be a giant blur of fun, dance floor, and breathers once I got on the boat.  There was no concept of time until the very end, it was simply - amazing.  Walked around the boat and explored everywhere, the top deck first, but decided to go back down through the stairs and settled on setting up camp on Deck B at the very front of the boat.  worked out a system of having at least two people at our two tables pulled together...we couldn't use the coat check because it wasn't sueprvised, and we all had cams/phones.  Talked a bit, remarked on how everyone was so ncie looking, said our his and made rounds, taking random pictures.  Most ""prominent"" seniors were present...the whole ""incrowd"" of gr. 11.  They were fairly icy for the most part on the boat, they ahd their corner close to us, only Leah/Annabelle said hi.  Lorne+carol/Kevin+Joyce just cuddled.  Owen/Tomasz attached themselves to us the whoel time.  Bah.  Poured outside on the deck for a while, and people split for a short bit.  The view from the deck was so beautiful...just staring at the glistening lit-up skyline of my first-class city, the apartments of Coal Harbour, lights in Stanley Park, Canada Place...wow.  The cool breeze was a nice touch too, and it was a very romantic and beautiful spot to be in.  Got dragged by Megan downstairs to get another plate of Bits N Bites, heh.  Went back up and soon Alice dragged me out onto the dance floor!  

Felt so weird at first - I ...don't...dance.  What made me feel even weirder was that I failed the Big Band Dance and there was a serious lack of guys on the floor - any that were there just simply bopped heads or grinded with their girlfriends.  Whoo.  But the DJ was pretty good and I got to loosen up a bit, staretd havign some fun...with the help of Tania/Alice/Karen/Heidi.  Eventually we moved downstairs because it was empty!  There were people, but no one dancing.  So we danced in our little circle with me feelign very self-conscious.  But then everyone started pouring down to get food and everyone followed our trend!  before we knew it, the floor was packed and it became the gr. 12 floor...you KNOW that it;s better than the gr. 11 floor, ha!  I didn't even know until Mary told me, no wodner I didn't see Annabelle and Co.  Tried to get food but I wasn't given tickets for that.  Fools.  The songs were so good, so loud...such nice beats to sway to.  Felt a lot more confident alogn the way, but still not enough.  But soon I just fell into it - it didn't matter how bad I looked, it was SO FUN!!!!  Felt so wild and alive like never before, and being with all my favourite people in the world (minus Fabian..><)...nothing could have been better.  Just throwing my hands up in the air, swaying and moving to the music, the bass, the rhythm...yes!  Then we spotted Taylor.  Wow.  Good dance, and he was so popular!  All the new people (Caroline, Nick, Taylor)...have become popular so quickly!  Good for them i suppose.  He is pretty good looking, long and wavy blond locks, blue eyes, tall and slim...hehe.  Alice and I just kept inchign towards him, lol, and his dacnign was really cool.  There were ""dance stages"" being formed, and Farshad, and some Tugs/Koreans participated, but ultimately it was Taylor's show.  Whooooo!  

Later Megan pulled me away and said ""He's alone!"" and pushed me into a Taylor sipping on Nestea and watchign the dance floor alone.  I looked up a him, he smiled, adn I stammerd the first thign that came to mind: ""How much is your drink?""  It was so loud, he couldn't hear me...and just motioned his Nestea towards me.  I repeated myself and he just said ""Here, you can have mine..."" and said ""Bye!'  then walked off, with a confused me holding the can.  Was funny, to say the least.  Before long I rejoined the dance floor and continued non-stop.  Alice is such a good dancer...and Steph?  OMP.  Dirty girl, you'd never be able to tell!  Tania wasn't bad, neither was Karen, and Heidi is so dirty!  We could be crazy dancing dirty girls if I were a girl, lmao.  Saw Lauren, Theresa, Devina, adn Zoe lots too, they're loads of energetic fun!  Slow danced with Megan twice and Alice one...I can't remember the songs, there was one I didn't know, ""Beautiful - Christina Aguilera"", and something else.  At one point we went outside to take some more pictures, and we stared out as we passed under Lions Gate.  I think we went out somewhere off West Van.  Took my camera to the dance floor at one point too.    

There were so many great fast songs and hip hop...mmm...particular ones that stood out...""Rock Your Body - Justin Timberlake"" (usually I don't like him too much, but SOOO nice to dance), ""Toxic - Britney Spears"" (hard to dance to but fun, hehe), ""Yeah - Usher"" (smashingly strong beat), ""Stand Up - Ludacris"".  Wow, just lettign myself go felt so good.  At the end...they announced that we'd be back at port in 10 min.  I thought they'd just stop the music and ask us to clean up!  But then they started up again and played ""Hey Ya""...now that was dancing!  Everyone went wild and we shouted out all the speaking parts and then some!  What a high point...!  You know what came along?  MAROON 5 ""This Love""!!!!  The DJ knew to save it for last, and everyone was bouncign to the beat and screaming out the song.  I was tol, and couldn't even hear myself.  We all did the dance from the music video, it was so awesome!  I've never had a better time.  I wish I could recreate the feeling..well, next year hehe.  

At the end we gathered the stuff and got off the boat, taking some more pictures and chatting with Ness+Hanah+Linda.  Wanted a pic with Justin but lost him...hehe Mary has a pic though, she can send it later!  Everyone just sort of left, adn we said bye, then Mary/Alice/myself walked down to the Safeway with them two complaining about their feet the whole time.  Mine hurt a bit too, lol!  Waited inside Safeway and talked (Taylor working at Gap -> icing on the cake -> straw on the camel's back -> camel with icing -> brownies renamed camel chunks) till my dad picked us up, then it was home we went.  

What an evening."

Cellphone isn't working.  I can receive and dial and such just fine, and I can hear the other side perfectly fine, but no one can hear me.  My phone just won't pick up sounds!  Hahah it's funny, ironically enough I left my phone at Dylan's house anyway.  My voice is hoarse from a shouting match in a vain attempt to get my mother away form my fucking stuff.  I hate shouting, it kills my voice.  Why won't anyone/anything fucking listen to me.  My printer died so i couldn't print out my French, so I got to school and made a mad scramble during block one.  Mary's screw up probably costed group marks.  Math sucks and involves wastign 12843269712 pieces of paper, but again, ironically, I can't print anyway.  The French homework is shit, it's insanely long adn insanely difficult.  I can't see Fabian and I miss him, and I won't see him until October if THAT even happens at all.  I don't want to go to fuckign math tomorrow because there's always the longest 90 minutes I ever experience.  Unless you count math today, that was pretty brutal too.  Or how about call waiting?  I think everyone needs to get call waiting.  Oh and the thing yesterday?  Turns out Amanda stupidly started a discussion about my sexuality in the caf, totally unaware/not caring that Luc and all his skater friends were right there.  Lovely, now it'll spread like wildfire before dying in 2 weeks.  It is so hard for her to see the situation I'm in?  And hahah she told Vicky too!  Just lovely.  Stupid bitch, can she not see the predicament it puts ME in?  Whay right doies she have to be all defensive about it and say that ""Luc probably suspected it anyway""?  What the fuck does that have to do with anything?  Is it so hard to fathom?  And on the same topic, it turns out Alvin was the one that saw Dylan and I together.  He denies it and won't admit or say anything.  Fuck.  Why are all these secrets kept from me when it's MY LIFE?!?!?!  He probably told everyone from church too.  Just great.  If that were to happen, I'd die.  The congregation is completely Chinese and guess what?  My parents are friends with half of them.  I'm feeling so angry and cranky and tired and everything else.  I need some sleep I think.  But bio/french/math aren't gonna let that happen.  

Good things:  I'm now in Spanish 11, hooray for me.  I'm in Phoenix too, hooray again.  Dilly is coming for sure.  Whoo.  Got to talk with Megan at x-country and we had gelato.  And 10/10 on my essay.  Ok.  Bye."

"event","It's been a pretty nice day, just a little dent towards the end, heh.

Woke up later than I should have, and tlaked to Mary on the phone longer than I should have.  As a consequence I missed the bus to Aaron's house, but thankfully Kate had space in her new Civic and could pick me up on the way to North Van!  Made green tea and fooled around with the flute while waiting for them, and got in the car to discover Jordan adn a friend, Elysse, as well as Siannie.  Off we drove to North Van, it was nice, and Elysse turned out to be pretty approachable and friendly.  The music was nice, and it was fun to chat for a bit in the car!  

Aaron's grandparents' house was in a nice neighbourhood in North Van, probably likened to...umm...maybe the Vancouver Gold Course area sorta deal.  Upper middle class, but it was right off the Seymour Parkway with the moutnains as the backdrop.  Nice!  Got changed and such, and spent the day lounging about muching on nachos, Dutch treats Celina brought back (buttered white bread with chocolate, it's A LOT better than it sounds!), and soft drinks.  The backyard and the house were pretty...wooden, lol.  The house resembled a giant series of wooden blocks, and the yard basically consisted of the pool and the patio/deck surrounding it.  The swing/lawn furniture were comfty though.  Swam around the pool, splashed around, and chatted with mainly Kate/Sian/Jordan.  Relazing, and the weather helped...warmish and sunny, and the water was SO warm!  Headed home around 3, just the Crothers/Jordan/myself in the car.  Got dropped off and came home...didn't do much, used to computer, cleaned up, TV, the usual.

Parents came home and made me go drive, grrr it was so frustrating parking!  I realise he was doing it out of my best interests, but Dad was expectign that I'd get EVERYTHING right away, AH.  It was surprisingly hard and doesn't make future driving very enticing.  Almost rammed into a van while practicing at Blue Mountain, my mind wandered and panicked when I saw the car.  It was not pleasent, to say the least.  Dinner awaits....that doesn't look too enticing either, lol.  

Can't believe it's the last day before school starts up and everything starts snowballing again.  This freedom and relaxation was much needed, but I think it's been sufficient and I'm ready to go back.  Looking forward to seeign everyone again tomorrow!  Well, almost everyone.  Yay :).  It'll take my off things anyway.  So weary of a lot of things at the moment.  The blind feeling is overwhelming, for one.    

Current mood: Reeeally tired, swimming makes me happily tired, hehe.  Less so now because the adrenaline from the near-accident is still rushing through me...and slightly hungry, hmm.  
Current sound: the Canto news and the cou you yeen gae
Current activity: I'm gonna phone Mary to arrange rides for tomorrow...and maybe TV a little, then dinner"

"event","These last two days have been quite fun, great back to Vancouver welcome sort of thing for me, hehe.  Well, no, it was just nice to see everyone again before the storm hits.

Yesterday...woke up pretty late, same with parents.  sat aroudn for a bit before parents decided to get ready, adn asked if I wanted to bring a friend for the day.  It was sorta nice because they were very pleasent, almost apologetic for how harsh they were before.  So I called Alice up, but she had to prepare for here sis' bday party, so I got Mary to coem along instead!  I drove over to her palce and picked her up, then we set off to go to Richmond for dim sum.  Afterwards we walked to Richmond Centre across the street and set out to randomly roam while my parents went somewhere else.  We hit Banana Republic first...Mary tried on the sppifyest black and lavender/magenta pinstripe suit!  She looked very much like...Tina..or her partner, rather, from ""The 'L' Word"".  So...""I'm ready to conquer the business world!"" sorta look.  Then we went to Mexx and I tried on one too...it was chocolate brown with a plain white shirt, and a purple/red/maroon-ish tie.  The ensemble itself was nice, just not on me.  And Mary's was ncie as well, but nothing like the BR one.  Walked around more, ...then got picked up by parents.  Went for Happy Hour with ""Crazy Lady"" *shudder* at Wong Zong Wong.  It was alright, we ended up spending most of our time discussing school issues, awards, grades, people etc.  And we figured out that she is Alex's succesor, Lorne/Asif = Matt, Me = Cassie, and Terrence = George.  Bah.  Then we drove off to Dad's office so he could sign some documents, but headed to the Night Market!  It was alright, a bit crowded, but I did want to see it before summer's end.  Ended up buying 3 books and very little else.  Dropped her off, went home, had soem food...MSN...then bed.  Pleasent day :)

Today... woke up around 8:45 and got ready for school, as Mary picked me up @ 9:45 or so.  got to the school and it felt...normal, actually.  I ahte to say it, but the school gives me a sense of belonging, and I like it there.  Even if it's PMSS and I loathe it during the year.  But the people, some of the staff...I feel a connection, like it's OUR school.  Not just school, but OUR school.  Maybe it's school pride creeping up on me.  *GEEK*, hehe.  Went through the SOAR stuff, it was quite a small group, which wasn't bad.  And it turns out my group will be Shashi and Deb...wooowww experience much?  Translating into ""Marco won't really do anything probably"".  Anyway, it went well, adn Ms. Tsui/Mrs. Ciolfitto are awesome..and their kids SO CUTE!!!  Afterwards we bussed to the library and discovered that Alice was already there and we didn't have to wait, yay!  Went to lunch at Kingspark, it was rather fun...KILL THOSE LEMONS!  At first I wasn't sure what to say, I hadn't seen her in such a long while!  But things got moving and it was like the old days again, *warm and fuzzy*.  Went into Coquitlam Centre for a bit..didn't really see much of anything, and left pretty quickly.  We said goodbye to Mary and took the bus home.  Shoed her all my Quebec stuff and gave her her due souveniers!  Played cards/chatted outside till parents came home, adn then they gave us a lift to her palce.  We played with the piano/violin for a while..and DAMN IT, she beat me at darts TWICE!  GRR!  :P!  Dinner came along and we went and explored her room after, seeing all her British memorabilia.  Pretty soon we left for volleyball and met up with Wai, Paeony, Amannda, and Karen there.  It was rather embarassign tryign to amass $3.40 for the drop-in in petty change.  Got some from amanda, some from Alice...lol and I still have Karen's money, gotta pay them all back. Changed and felt rather amateur hour as ther were a lot, wait, ALL adults there.  Practiced a little bit but started off playign against soem adults, oooh...embarrassing.  But it got steadily better as the night progressed,a dn everyone was really positive!  Anyway, Karen and I came up witht eh entire ""positive, negative, equal, and floor"" ting, as well as ""over...IN!"".  So it's all good, hehe!  It was so fun, wasn't heavy heavy exercise, but nice to mvoe around.  It still makes me really remorseful thinking about how I quit vball in middle school, *sigh*.  And it's not even like I can try out now because it's gr. 11 and it's at the exact same time as x-country anyway.  Everything wrapped up by 10:30 adn got a ride home with Karen.  My goodness we had such fun with that recording bear...*animal noises*.  It felt so much like our gr. 9 group again, or gr. 10 sem 1...*sigh* :).  Great day, haven't had fun like that in a while.  

Briefly mentioned Vic yesterday, parnets said they'd think about it.  That's goood...I think, btu I'm still afraid to bring it up tonight.  I need to though I guess.  I really don't think having dinner with Alice nor goign out to vball helped it, but it wouldn't have been fair to my friends if I skipped out on everything just coz..well, you know.  Anyway, night."

"event","Fuck I hate my dad.  I remember why I hate home.  I had such an awesome evening, ...it's like the numerous other entries in here, I have a great day, gets ruined, then I bitch here.  What a cycle.  I hate this place.  Fuck it all.

Woke up at 8am because no one actually remmebred that the fixing dude was comign to work on the furnace.  He rang the doorbell and everyone woke up all groggy.  I went back to bed and somehow slept till...close to 11, then I woke up, got dressed, and went to dim sum with Dad and his friends.  It was nice and boring, but I managed to finish Miss Wyoming.  Saw Josephine there, that was a...surprise,t o say the least.  I never know what to say to her, especially after the whole Incident, I never know what to do with her.  She's pleasent enough to me I suppose...but...oh, I don't know.  Went to the mall after, just for a stroll, had a little bit of time to spare before Sian's.  Dad ended up leaving the mall at 3 and Mary picked me up by 3:20 or so, and I helped her mom sort issues out at CCAC.  Then we got dropped off at Siannie's, yay!

Got there and Meggy was ready to greet us both with a great big hug.  We just started to delegate jobs at the front room, and I got to vaccum again, yay lol.  Jordan got there by 4 or so, and I finished up vaccuming the front room, and most of the main floor.  They did the salad and such, and various other chores.  It was sorta nice working to Nirvana, hehe.  It was so...absolutely wonderful being with my core group of friends, Mary, Sian, Megan, our lil' ""clique"".  Haha Jordan was great fun to have around as well.  But we all felt so intimate, so close...and we realised that, wow, we were WERE a clique.  It was a surprise to most of us when we found out that Jordan had invited Annabelle, Vanessa, and Ryan...so we started setting instead.  I suppose we weren't thrilled with that, but we weren't totally against them coming.  The cajun shrimp smelled sooo good in that sauce, though they were a bit overcooked.  Mary and I declared the sauce not spicy at all, and proceeded to add insane amounts of chili powder, hot sauce (which ended up evaporating??), and ground pepper.  Jordan discovered the difference between his spicy and Asian spicy, lol, and I discovered the existence of Kate-white-spicy.  Such fun just cooking and chatting with everyone, even chores didn't feel like chores at all.  For a while I was reading Ivan's book on the Holocaust, which was horrible and caused me to be anti-social for a little while.  But how can you be anti-social with friends and spiked punch?  Anyway, Kate, Ryan, Annabelle, vanessa all got here at about 7 or so, and we just hung out and finished setting up while Vanessa had her shower (she just got there from dance).    

Punch went a little funny - neither Megan nor myself realised that it was CONCENTRATED orange juice.  And then jordan added 4 shots of tequila, which was nice.  Mm.  Then he made me and Mary down a shot,  and aww Mary gets red easy! Hehe.  Dinner was great, the pasta turned out really nice and tasty, and it was just great with dashes of pepper and hot sauce.  The salad I wasn't much for - I dislike vinegar.  Afterwards we just cleaned up a bit and everyone split doing different things.  I ended up floating around, cahtting with Kate and Ryan, Annabelle, and then going upstairs with Mary and Megan, but I spent a lot of time with Jordan as well.  in the end it ended like it always does - Megan, Mary and I chatting away about ...things.  Was nice :).  Then Megan's dad drove us home and I got back around 11:40 or so.  Funniest moment...Jordan and I hid out in Sian's room and listened to the girls as they chatted below us on the deck.  Now, her window has a screen, and it was slightly popped out for some reason, expposing a little crack.  So I grabbed a kleenex and shoved it through the crack, hoping to surprise them as it floated downwards.  But I poked the screen, and it seperted entirely - and the whole thing crashed down on the deck, narrowly missing Megan and the candles.  Vanessa came in thw room just as that happened, and we all just died of laughter.  Course, Sian wasn't nearly as pleased.  Another one...Annabelle was bringing ice cream to Jordan and I as I was trying to emulate Jordan's crazy stretchign he does for dance.  I was doubled over backwards with my ass in the air. Ahh, attractive.    

Waited for Fabian for a bit but went to bed instead.  Just woke up this morning at...umm..10 I think.  It's all overcast and slightly cool outside, unfortunately.  I was reading the Province but stopped when there was a spider adn i just smooshed it.  Poor thing, I do like spiders, just not in my paper.  The nice weather is stuck south of the border, even Seattle's getting up to 25 degrees today.  Damn it!  Wonder what the day will be like, I have absolutely nothing planned...most likely I'll go shower now.  Then..lunch and god knows what afterwards.  

I appreciate the thoughts, and there's no doubt that you're both right.  I'll try and smile, but it's not always easy.  My life is so trivial and petty sometimes.  Wait, all the time.  

Current mood: neither here nor there, slightly groggy
Current activity: well, I'll go shower now
Current sound: nothing,  can hear the hulahoop in my mom's room."

"event","This sucks.  I'm not tired becasue I've basically slept or lounged the last 24 hours, and because of my already-previously-screwed sleeping schedule.  Sorta hlaf-hoping that Fabian would come online, he was sometime earlier today but disappeared.  I'm so tired of watching old reruns of random shows, and it's too late anyway for anything remotely decent to be on TV!  Well, maybe not, things are ok up till 3AM EST or so thanks to the BC channels.  I think I'm still going to Quebec city tomorrow, but I just don't feel like sleeping.  Stomach doesn't hurt anymore, but I still can't take a lot of food.  Just soft bland stuff for now.  Muscles are weak, going upstairs makes me tired.  Better now.  No one interesting's online other than Eric.  bah."

"event","Grr, Dad's always so grumpy and cranky in the mornings.  At least in the mornings I don't incovenience other people and it's more slow-responses than just lashing out at someone.  I understand his frustration, I'm out quite a lot, especially Dwontown.  He has this day off and wants to spend it with me.  It's rather unfortunate that I don't have the same inclinations, for a day with him nearly always ends with disaster.  I'm so horrible, they feed me, clothe him, give me everything, but that's how I feel.  I know he's not interested in the same activities or sights as I am, and vice versa.  Memories of vacations conjure up images of frustrations for all.  I usually want to stop and take everything in, take pictures, just peeking into anything interesting...all he wants to do is drive on, on the quest to absolutely nowhere, just...further on.  He's travelled extensively in the past and has lost all passions for sightseeing.  I get frustrated at the fact that I can't see anything, and he get mad at the fact that he has to slow down.  Then he always gets really pissy and says something like ""We're only here in this stupid place anyway because YOu like travelling.  I hate this!""  Whoo, family vacations.  Fine, I'll just cancel and commit myself to family.  Whoo.  Feel the excitement.

I really must update more often, so much has been going on!  I went back to volunteerign at Daeil on Wednesday, it was a nice surprise for everyone.  It was rather boring to start off with, because Mrs. Browne had no idea I was returnign and she had no tasks for me to do.  Ended up going to the aquarium though, which was entertaining for a bit!  My favourite part was the tropical rainforest, with the flamboyant lookign birds and the colourful butterflies!  There was one that was a shiny metallic blue on the front, but on the back it had patterns of red, brown, and yellow.  :D!!!  The belugas were also neat, though in the words of Megan, the dolphin show was ""anticlimatical"".  It was a nice and cool day, overcast...then it started raining.  Thank god for tree cover!  Got a great chance to chat with Kay and Laura.  

Thursday was Fabers' operation...he is fine now, yay!  Gimpy, but good.  Aww, poor thing, at least it's on for 2 weeks instead of 6 like mine.  Anyway Thursday was also the last day for the Daeil kids, adn we did a lot of SAT prep stuff, hooray for getting SAT material for free!  The SATs are so difficult, and the top-500 vocabulary and word roots/suffixes/prefixes are insane.  But then we ahd the closign ceremonies...that was ind-blowing, only because of the traditional Korean music.  Four of them got up front in traditional costume and performed a dazzlign percussion piece, with two drums, a gong, and a metal pan sorta thing.  Kai was playign the gong :)!  Combined with chanting and shouts, the powerful percussion was moving, it was so easy to envision the spirit and culture of Korea, flowing through the rooom in the form of sound waves.  I was so proud of Kai!!  Had cake after, and some of the peopel gave me little gifts...haha, the cutest lil' Asian notebooks and pens!  Then we went to Coquitlam Centre after, wihci was reeeaaally boring.  But I did get invited to dinner at Kai/Christine's, which turned out to be a blast.  Figured going home woudl be a waste of time, so I called Megan up and we hung out at the library and Chapters (aren't we exciting?!).  Then I bussed up to Landowne, where Kai's homestay is - and the biggest coincidence occured!  At Guildford, Stan Bokov got on!  I asked where he was headed and he said Julie's, which was on the same street as Kai's.  So he helped me and I got there just fine.  Lex was a bit trying, but a sweet kid (the homestay's grandson).  Dinner was pretty good, I liked the pancake, and it was non-stop chatting and laughing!  The homestay people were very friendly and liberal, we must ahev spent half an hour tlaking about transvestites!  Had tea after, and Dad picked Kay and I up aroudn 11:30.  Aw, I miss the Korean kids...I didn't think I really would!  

I need to go now, figure out what I'm going to do, *sigh*.  Bye, by the way Fabian, I'll be on later tongiht to tell you the details.  Or I'll email."

I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
Thats why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new

"event","Today was rather freaky, so many weird feelings.  After all of this I'm so relieved that he's still with me, I love him so much.  The testing thing was horrid, in a sense.  

Woke up around 10, despite not sleeping until 5:30am or so.  Couldn't help it, parents unwittignly woke me up as they got ready for work, and they invited me to breakfast.  So I left with them and ended up at Chapters as usual.  Missed one bus (watch it pull away form the curb), so I didn't actually get home till close to 12.  Talked with him on MSN when I got home, he was so worried.  It was starnge, I was...so aloof, and optimistic feeling.  I thought about all the possibilities, threats, dangers, and realised that any chance of me having anything was VERY slim.  Headed out on the bus to New West after, where the clinic was.  I passed right by it and thought..""Oh..I can't do this..""  But then I thought about Fabian, my responsibility, my love for him, everythign else, the peace of mind that would come after, and I went right in.  I was greeted by Janet, a very nice and cheerful individual.  Had to fill some forms, and ended up sitting there for THREE HOURS.  I was there by 2:30, when it opened, but there were 11 girls before me.  Their main ""attraction"" is birth control, so everyone there other than me was a girl.  Well, one brought her bf.  Just wrote, read, and worried a little.  By 5:30 I was called, and well - it was a female nurse.  I was a little stunned and worried at first, but she was so nice, made me feel so comfortable!  Went through some questions and began with the blood test.  That didn't hurt too badly, but it happened twice because the first time the vein popped away.  I'm not freaked out by needles - but my body reacted anyway.  I had to stand up and drop my pants, and as I did the delayed reaction to the needle and the blood taken came.  Suddenly felt very very dizzy, and nausea.  Had to sit down for a bit with some water before we could continue.  She was very encouraging and supportive.  We cahtted the whole time, her kids, my life, Montreal...etc.  Then the um..more awkward procedures came, we won't talk about that.  In the end, she said I could check and call before I leave for Montreal, and everyting other than the HIV test should be done.  So I'll go and call to check next Tuesday...they can grant me all the results over the phone other than HIV - that they have to do in person, positive or negative.  Maybe it's because it's a reportable disease and there's lots of other procedures associated with that.  We'll see.  I'm not very worried at all now, I'm so glad it's over with.

Got home, talked to Molly and Fabian a little bit, watched Friends, and had a TV dinner to tide me over before parents get home at 9.  Still waiting for them!  Hungry :(.  Talkignt o brett right now, he read Fabers' journal and is slightly worried.  But I wasn't on the scene yet when him and Fabian were together.  He's fine.  Mission of the evening: hide the needle bad-aids from parents.  

I'll probably update later, or tomorrow, about the amazing weekend.  Too tired right now, oy.  Anyway, I'm off, ...Fabian, thank you.  Love you lots :)

Current mood: sorta weird...not mcuh of anythign, missign Fabian, thinking about the aquarium tomorrow.  I can't get anyone to go to the fireworks..OR Saturday!  AHHHHH!        
Current activity: listening to BBC 1, waiting for parents, trying to find people for Wednesday/Saturday, cleaning up a little, talking to Brett
Current sounds: BBC 1"

"event","Better now, found people to chat with, and it's brightening up a little outside.  Still darker than it should be due to the clouds...but the rain will be good for everyone, plants and fires included.  I'm probably blowing this way outta proportion, but the thought is daunting.  Currently debating with myself whether to hea to the station or not...I feel bad for skipping two days I said I'd be there for.  But I really don't want to pull an all-nighter and go work, I wouldn't get very much done before I turn cranky and difficult.  I figure I can probably sleep now, and then wake up close to know, eat...and head down to New West.  I'll leave a note for my parents for when they wake up, it'll just say that I couldn't fall asleep and just didn't feel up to the commute and work.  They'll understand.  I think Fabian's taking the day off too...maybe I'll see him.  Or has his pre-surgery day-off started already?  We really need each other right now.  Time to write a note and sleep till noon...for once, I don't think I mind sleeping in."

"event","I can't sleep, bothers me too much right now.  It's not even just that, it's the feeling of loneliness as well.  I tried lying there for another 10 minutes and it was impossible, even with Smiley B there.  Maybe when the sun comes up I'll be better.  There's no way I can go tomorrow, I'll have to tell them I'm sick...which I am, in a sense.  I'm not going to sleep for one hour and then go for a 8 hour day.  trying to be chipper and giving up directions over and over and answer the same mundane questions again and again.  I refuse!  Love, confusion, fear, remorse, and what have you, all floating around in a witch's brew of emotions.  I need to and want to focus on what was and IS good...but it's hard as I stare blankly at the humming screen, the only light emitting from the flourescent light, and the tiny night light in my neighbour's kichen window.  And Adam has gone offline.  There is the reddish/maroon glow you see at night before rain...from that I can see faint outlines of clouds.  I need someone to talk to, I hate this...alone."

"event","Just a bit tired, munching on apples, and waiting for my special guy to get home.  Today was sorta nice, other than the searing heat.  It was so stuffy inside the station, and especially so since all three of us were crammed in the little booth and not allowed to sit on the faux-counter.  Stupid VIA Rail dude...just him though, the other guys at Via are really nice to me.  Serena turned out to be great to work with, and it was the second shift for both Terry and Serena.  Teery isn't much fun (can you say math geek cross fob?), but he's not bad to work with..he just doesn't know info sometimes, but Serena and I cover for him.  Serena's great fun, we kept crackign jokes and laughing at random.  It wasn't nearly as boring today, but more tiring for some reason, or else it was just the heat getting to me.  IHorray for Spanish, I helped out this couple from the US all in Spanish today...was so proud.  It was difficult though.  I am slowly getting used to commuting, it's not too bad once you settle into the pattern, bring music/books, and learn to enjoy the flashing scenery.  Stayed till 3:50 today (wow!), then got home ..forot when.  Called Mary up eventually and got her to go to the gym at Chimo Pool so I wouldn't feel silly going by myself.  So she picked me up at 6:15 or so and off we went.  She saw Mahinda there, and then we paid and got in.  It was nice, actually...there were little cahrts everywhere explainign different muscles and exercises, as well as aerobic training.  The mahcines seemed fairly new and easy to use, so I hopped on the bike and Mary went on the one beside me.  Went through a couple of machines just to explore, since it was my first time.  Spend most time doing aerobic stuff (mmm...air conditioning), on the Stairmaster and the bike.  Spent a fair time on the abs thing and usign the stretch rope, as ewll as the quad thingy.  Left around 8 and got a ride back...I'm definately headign back for another visit, I really enjoyed it!  And well...there WAS this one blond...just joking Fabers!  Good experience though.  Was just going to shower there out of convenience, brought soap and shampoo and all...but managed to neglect the simplest, most essential item - a towel!  came home, watched Will and Grace and then ahd dinner.  Here I am now!

Really excited about Saturday, I can't believe it's only two days away.  One thing though, I ENTIRELY forgot my dad has Saturday off now...and from listening to Mom's phone conversation, she has this Saturday off as well.  Mmmm, how perfect, I'm going to just stay out in Vancouevr as long as I cna to avoid them for a bit with Fabian.  But oh crap, he has to drop off stuff, ...grrr.  Maybe we can just have lunch with the rents, then we'll meet up with others.  Lorne's comign at 2 anyway, ha.  Already changed the reservations, go me...and oh good lord, Cong's sister + bf are comign along.  Wowness.  Going to head off for a few minutes...hope he comes home soon, hehe.

Current mood: pretty good, just tired is all
Current activity: going to my room to fidn random items

"event","Today was Hannah's last day, I'll miss her a lil bit.  She wasn't particularly fun or anything, but I enjoyed her maturity and quiet humour.  Two more days for me!  I think I WILL be back for the last week of International Ed.  Not much happened today, my bright shining moment was most sexcellent though!  I went to the back to photocopy the schedule of ""The Canadian"", and it took such a long time...it was one of those old school copiers, ugh!  Came back and Hannah pointed at a confused man in a yellow shirt and said, ""I think he needs your help, he only speaks French.""  So I went over there and just said..""Bonjour?""  Turns out he just wanted to know if this was the only Greyhoudn stop in Vancouver, and that he had just arrived from Seattle.  I replied with that this was indeed the only one in Vancouver, with the exception of the one 30 km east.  Problem solved...all in French too!  That was my proud moment, hehe.  Today wasn't busy in the sens that people were lining up to inquire about stuff, but busy like there was a constant trickle of people.  I prefer it this way, feels less hectic and no one's unhappy...yet keeps me busy.  Left around 3:20 but missed the 3:50 bus anyway.  Came home and caught Fabian for a little bit before he went to work, then I just chatted with Mary on the phone.  I don't know when Dad's comign home, or even if I'm going to Richmond with him.  Doesn't really matter I guess!  Grrr the fireworks are tonight, I want to go, but parents will be displeased that I didn't give them any notice and that I wouldn't really be going with anyone else.  Oh well.  Maybe next year I'll go to all four...unless I go to Peru!  Speaking of which, damn it Mary, she's going to Greece for spring break, California before that, and Peru in the summer.  Bi..I mean, lucky girl!  I want to be rich like her, heh.  Neighbours are having some sorta BBQ with their friends.  They seem alright, not overly warm nor icy, just..""there"".  Brought over soem fruit and stuff to welcome them, and that was that.  They seem ""North Dakotan"" somehow, like they could be from the prairies.  But of course, I'm just going by appearance (rural looking, slightly large, a lil' tanned..or wait, maybe just Midwest.  Somewhere midwest, rural or urban.  But most likely they just moved 10 minutes from their original house, ha.  Fabian seems a little more aloof lately, but then again it's just me being paranoid.  Still really loking forward to Saturday.  Ah, a problem springs to mind...Gloria can come but might bring two friends.  

A) I need to change the reservation
B) Um...now her friends (who don't go to my school..but still) will be there, I'll feel a little awkward 

Soo...wasn't too pleased, but oh well!  The more the merrier I suppose.  Anyway, gonna head out to richmond now, back later around 11:30."

"event","Guess I should update, haven't done so in a little while...because I've been pretty exhausted.  Felt so middle-aged commuter-ish yesterday, it was the frist day with the morning/afternoon work rush hours on the train.  Felt like I had 2 toddlers waiting to be fed at home and a grumbling wife as well, and me trudging off to a dead-end job.  Anyway.  Volunteering isn't too bad, I actually enjoyed havign only myself there today.  But I still could use Hannah's company, as littler as it might be.  I get many quirky questions and often they are displeased when I don't know the answers to questions such as ""How much is airfare to Medicine Hat, Alberta?""  First of all...Pacific Central is a bus depot/train station.  Second of all...do I look like a travel agency to you?  It says ""General Information"".  Lastly...of all places, Medicine Hat?  Sometimes people don't believe what I say, to which my response is, ...then why'd you ask me in the first place?  Though I have to admit, I have made several mistakes these last few days...sent a man to a bank 3 blocks further, and sometimes they misunderstand because most don't speak English.  By the end of the day I'm dead tired, and sleep on the train back to Lougheed.  There are positives though, many people are genuinely thankful and grateful for our service.  I also feel very good about myself when I know I made an improvement in someone's day.  In addition, I always enjoy sharing my knowledge of my home town, I know so much about the attarctions and transportation (I like being a tourist in my own town!).  And hey...since when am I thanked for bossing people around? :P  Also it's great experience, I've learnt so much about customer service and tourism from this position.  And it gives me an excuse to head downtown, hehe.  Three times now I've headed Dwontown just because it was close to the station.  

TUTS with Alice on Saturday night was a blast.  After my first day at te station, I left at around 3:30 and headed to Robosn.  Went through the are and eventually amde my way down to English Bay.  Alice was supposed to meet me at 5:30, but called me up to tell me to be linign up at Malkin Bowl for them...and that they wouldn't be there until after 6.  I just sat in English Bay for a long while, admiring the..um..scenery.  It was the day it reached 37 degrees, so it was very nice being there by the water.  Took my shoes off on impulse and waded around - good decision!  Ran to Malkin Bowl, ahh it was so much farther than I thought...I didn't get there until ...5:50?  But the line wasn't too bad.  Aice got there afterwards, and we had wraps/cookies (by Alice) and OJ!  Walked around the seawall with her, that was calming, till we had to run back when we realised we were a little late.  Got herded in and got rpetty good spots on the right.  Then we grabbed the cards and played for a while until Katie brought back the volleyball.  The show itself was excellent, ber humourous!  It was even better than last year, this was more dramatic and full of dancing and such.  My favourite character was most indefinately the blond girl...""zoom...no, ZOOOM!"" and ""I don't get it...!""  Alice...bitchbus, Wheezly Cat, ZOOM!  Afterwards we went back in Alice's van, and that was the end.  Yayness.  

Went to English Bay with Ness today, I was very quiet and said very little...so tired.  But I saw tthe British lady who asked me questions earlier, at the Skytrain platform.  Ness and I took her to the hostel, which was on our way anyway.  Nice relaxing hour or so on the beach, actually fell asleep at one point.  Bussed down robosn and went in some shops, and yay rvsp'ed at Milestone's, Saturday @ 5PM!  YAY!  *sees Fabian go: :|!!*  Her dad drove us home from Lougheed, adn I went to dinener with Father at Boston Pizza.  Here I am!  

Waiting for Fabian to come online, no one else to talk to at moment.  Very cheerful because I'm thinking about his visit! Hehehe!  

Current mood: ""chipper""
Current activity: I did want to got to the neighbour's the formally introduce myself, but my  parents didn't want to and I don't have a housewarming gift to bring anyway.  And they didn't seem ultra-friendly the first time around.  
Current sound: Stupid dog is barking.  Every morning at 5~6am he howls.  I will eat him in my soup soon."

"event","Just came back from a walk with Sharon, realised how hot it is in the house!  it's still 29 degrees in here, according to the therometer.  It was nice, walked down to get her - it wasn't as close as I thought, it was on the corner of Lemax (7 minutes?).  Took her up to the village via Hillcrest, and then stopped at Shoppers for sunscreen and Starbucks for a drink.  I really enjoyed the weather outside as well as her company.  I try hard to eradicate any accent I have and ennounciate when I speak with them.  She's very easy to talk to, and is tryign very hard with her English.  It's really a shame that I will be at the train station instead...and that tomorrow will be my last day with them!  I have made many friends there (mostly girls), and they seem to enjoy having me around too.  Maybe after the train thing I'll go back for a couple of days before they leave!  They're all very nice and outgoing kids, and Ms. Browne is great too!  I'm actually learning some grammatical material, ha.  Be sure to take plenty of pictures tomorrow, Capilano and SFU should be a blast.  Damn my vertigo though...ugh.  But still fun!

Today was surprisingly busy, cut all their flashcards for them again, and mark sooo many pieces of homework.  Then along came their diagnostic SATs...poor children!  Poor me as well, they were such an effort to mark, 78 questions!  But even for me (I did 2 of the 3 sections they did) the test was very strenuous on the mind...wow, I didn't know 18 vocabulary words in the thing!  Ended up getting 27/31 and 10/12.  Anyway.  Alice came along after lunch, and we had the best time during their computer period!  Looking at the pictures and then laughing at ""Asian Products English"".  You know those cute Japanese/Chinese/Korean stationary thingies, clothing...how they like to put random English on it that makes njo sense?  Example...""Shooting star fall with sakura blossom...good friends let us catch wind together"" sorta thing?  Lol we found a site dedicated to that and we laughed our heads off!  Good times..""dessert menus"" and ""cheerful fox""!  Heavens, oh my goodness!

"event","Damn it.  I had so mcuh stuff typed up, and then Brett sent a link and upon clicking it my browser froze and it shut down.  All that I was typing was lost!  Arrrgh.  Anyway...still sitting here waiting for Dad to want to go eat.  I've been waiting for him all morning from 6am!  He's been up since noon, but hasn't done anything other than watch TV.  Fabian should be somewhere Downtown and having fun, I hope he remembered his camera, haha I forgot to remind him!

Held ""preliminary talks"" with Father, trying to find the best, most tactful way to make the prospect of Fabian coming to Montreal seem real.  Preliminaries weren't good.  He said that we don't know Fabian very well (which today's meeting, ahd it happened, would have amde him feel better about this!), and that my uncle would not be comfortable with a foreigner (ie non-Chinese person) coming with me.  This of course doesn't mean it's time to give up, no, though more often than not Dad stays true to his views.  

The first point is easy enough to overthrow, I can present a whole bunch of differnt things and good things about him, saying I DO know him well.  As well, I'll bring up the good manner in which he conducted himself last time he came to Vancouver.  I'll throw in some stuff about him having interest in both French and Asian cultures or something.  Second point, however, is definately an uphill battle.  I still haev a lot of points for that though, thought about it and typed it up but got erased.  Anyway, eat now, bye!"

"event","Had a lonnng long talk with Sian on her porch, apologised profusely, and told ehr all of what went on with my Dad, and my conversations with Mary and Alice last night.  No, it's even clearer this morning that Alice was right, and Sian agreed.  I still want him there more than ever, we'll just have to refrain from dancing together.  In itself, that could be a a blessings, hehehe.  

I really must broaden my views and open my eyes.  Here I am, sitting in a garden of gorgeous blooms, red, magenta, blue, white, orange...and of  all of those I'm only fousing on the little dandelion, the one ""imperfection"".  There are so many hidden blessings all aroudnme that I need to focus on.  Being thankful is a virtue!

Speaking of blessings...I found another.  I was talking with my mom in the car and she was really receptive to the idea of a friend coming along.  She said my uncle/aunt most likely would not mind, and she didn't see why my dad should mind either.  Points I presented were...a) I am used to exploring by myself, by being the flutz (flake, clutz, ditz) I am...having another person look out for me would be a good idea.  A foreign city is always much safer with two people.  As well, having travel companions are more fun, and if Mary could come, why can't Fabian?  I'll ask him later when he's in a good mood.  Most likely the problems will be on the Island, his hand and the costs.  Even the costs I'm not so worried about, we'll find a way.  Just his hand...I don't want him hurting himself.  It will be a full...well, almost a week after his operation.  It should be OK, right?  Anyway, shouldn't get my hopes up till I talk to Dad.  I will phone Fabian later at 8:30 or so to wake him up, despite the long distance charges....pft, if the trip can cancel on me like that, I'm sure a few pennies in phone charges can be spared.

I've been updating very often...just lots of things going through my mind, it's like a traffic jam.

Current mood: peaceful, yearning...weary..but overall not horrible.
Current activity: trying to figure out what to do for the day.  mm, juice.  *smiles*
Current sound: typing, birds outside...precious little else."

"event","Had hours-long phone conversations with Mary and Alice...regarding the senior sail and how I feel about Fabian.  Both presented so many new points that I had never considered before.  Will discuss with everyone eventually...!  But all I want to focus on right now is him, nothing else.  The happiness, us together, no...this isn't the ostrich head in the sand thing.  But he's really what I care about, us.  I'm happy to see him tomorrow!  But Dad's making me go to bed for good reasons, and I'll go sleep now.  grr couldn't wait for him!"

"event","Today was another great day...but as it wrapped up, I realised that my days fell incomplete without seeing him, hehe.  Thank god it's tomorrow that I will see him again, and being able to tlak to him every day certainly helps.  

Got up a little bit before ten I think...or after?  I can't remember.  Anyway, got to talk to Fabian a little bit, and by the way...we chose plan A last night.  I still might not go on a vacation, but just in case, I decided to call Ronith (the perosn at volunteering) and tell her I can't make those two days.  My cousin is getting married in Victoria! *groan* She wasn't there though, but she'll get the message eventually...that makes it a little scary, because I would haev liked confirmation that it would be OK.  Set out to pick Sian up and swung by Riverside to get Alice as well.  It was quite an adventure trying to find her, ha.  Drove out to Vancouver with my dad to eat, another little adventure trying to find Montreal Bank, eventually finding one at Oak and 41st.  Drove down to Gum Hoi Gok (West @ 41st) to eat, dim sum was alright...Sian seemed to enjoy it though, which was good.  Then we bussed down to Granville Station and set out from there!  It was boiling hot, I'm glad I decided to wear my sleeveless.  Poor Alice wore her jean jacket, and I had to carry it for her in the end.  

Walked the usual route, and spent some time down at Chapters on Hornby.  Went staright down Robson window shopping,a dn stopped at Stoneridge to return Alice's shoes...we decided that everyone who worked Downtown ahd to be gay.  Sian got Starbucks on Thurlow, but Alice and I held out until the gelato place on Denman.  Haha..Robson turned into Boston (inside joke!).  Oh, and crossign the street at 41st trying to catch the 98 was a near-death experience, a car ran a red and I blindly stepped onto the road trying to run after the 98!  As Sian said later, ""death wish!"".  And the baby on the 98 was so cute, it kept waving at us, hehe.  Anyway, got gelato (mmm coconut-mango)...but as we walked down English Bay, I stuck out my tongue with a bit too much force and pushed my gelato off the cone.  It was the most bizarre and hilarious thing as it landed with a ""thud"" on the sand.  We all bursted out laughing and decided it was a classic Marco, classified along with my run in with the escalator at chapters (heeey it's not my fault in went down and not up!).  It was great, and we walked along davie to get back, stopping at CIBC for Sian (damn White Spot people!) and Starbucks for ice (mmm).  Stopped at Pacific Centre at Granville @ Georgia because of this live performance staged by 99.3 The Fox...but I didn't recognise the band, it was...Seeds or soemthing, i couldn't hear it.  They were pretty good, and we tried to go for the Pepsi Challenge but ran out of time.  So we took the train home and took the 152 home with Sian.  Got home, sat around for a little while (yay my mom let me post my poster up! WOW!) and eventually had dinner over Chinese soaps.  They are evil things...they're not even good, all corny, same plotline...YET SO ADDICTIVE!  AHHH I HAD TO STOP MYSELF *sob*.  Anyone else who has watched them will tell you the same thing.  ""Oh..I've been lookign for a girl like you."" ""Who is that woman!""  ""I knew I'd find you here...remember, we're friends forever!"" ...etc. 

Got to connect with Sian a lot today, and got caught up a bit with Alice.  It was really nice...I feel a lot closer to Sian now, and she was very curious about Fabian.  She's very protective and maternal towards me, it's very much appreciated.  She was open to what I was doing, and seemed to be able to grasp a bit of what I'm feeling, what kinds of amazing feelings and experiences I have been having since I have met Fabian.  Apparently I light right up and go all cheery whenever he comes up, as opposed to the past relationships that she's seen me go through.  I'm not even aware of that...but I'll tell you, anythign about him makes me VERY happy.  Hehe.  She was also curious as to what I've been doing, and wanted to make sure that you know, I was being safe.  She's not very conservative that way as both her parnets are very liberal...and well, KATE's here sister! lol!  So I found a creative way to put it, a quote from Mambo Italiano...""HE's the bangee!""  I told Sian a lot of things today, and she seemed genuinely happy for me!  

I am...so pleased, so...ah, just indescribable the joy Fabian brings me.  Today with Sian was the first time I tried explaning it to someone, and it was a bit hard.  She didn't seem to think I was crazy though, which is always good.  I hate to use the word love loosely, at least to another person.  (Hey don't call me a liar when I say something like ""I LOVE JUIIIICE!""...I consider that a way different category from ""I love you"" or ""I love him"") I have no hesitation to tell Fabian that, none at all...love is for that special someone you want to spend your days with, and well...Fabian is that person, no one else.  Undeniably.  Call me insane, I've only known him since February...but, in my mind, there is no doubt.  For me past relationships have often been ""physical turned emotional"" (if we even got to that stage).  This one was definately emotional to physical...I see our physical intimacy as an extension of our feelings, and a celebration of that as well.  I want him to feel orgasmic (literally!), and vice versa.  Sorry if this is too much information, lol.  The future looks bleak sometimes, I'll admit, but we have each other.  That's it, that's all I care about.  It'll be very arduous and trying...but I'm willing to dot aht.  For him, anything.  If it's menat to be, it will happen, and I know it will.  Regardless of his future or mine, nay, our future, we'll be together somehow.  Senior sail suddenly seems so close, and I'll haev a great time with him.  I have spoken, I have decided.  I don't care whta anyone else thinks...he's coming! 

Oh, about tomorrow...I'll have to plan it out with him in detail once he gets home late tonight.  He's going to some party with Emma, aww, he'll have loads of fun.  I'll stay and be a good boy at home, I have already had my fun during the day.  Nevermind, haha he just came online.  Anyway, I'll pcik Sian up at 6:45 tomorrow, even though we're taking the 9am ferry."

"event","Went on a walk at Lafarge and Town Centre with Megan, that was really enjoyable..and needless to say, talking with Fabian always is the highpoint of my day.  Saturday is all set...that makes me happy, and our dilemma seems to be figured out.  I'll know by tomorrow morning whether it's a complete success or not!  Continuing on with my tale...

Right, he kissed me.  Wow...he was all hesitant in the car, but wow that kiss what NICE.  He just wanted till we had some privacy, and well...we couldn't help it, we were trapped in that room for a while.  (the room is deadly for sidetracking, as I found out)  Tehn we went upstairs, but there wasn't anything to do there except to play with the dog, so I decided that a walk/tour of Langford was in order.  Or, at least his little corner of Langford!  Dusty is cool though, no doubt...she likes her squeaky hamburger!  So we ste out and just wlaked down Avrill, with him pointing out some of the houses and me remarking that the arbutus(?) trees growing are not really found in Vancouver.  I think I was also boring him with facts and stuff about regional Vancouevr climate and the hill I live on, haha.  Eventually we ended up at Glen lake, where we took a trail down to a little boardwalk going across.  In the beginning I was just looking to the left, thinking...what a nice small pond..aww lillies and marshes and reeds!  Then I look to my right and discovered the other 99% of the lake, lol.  it was beautiful, stood for a while and Fabian told me a bit about the palce, and we just sat on the bench together and enjoyed the view...with the dragonflies flying nearby, ew.  And the lily pads were blooming, yay!  Continued walkign and learned about the Galloping Goose.  Eventually looped back to his house to discover his parents home.  I was hoping to meet Rie as well, but she was still at school.  It was funny, a bee totally freaked Fabian out at the front door, lol.

His parents were very nice and we chatted for a bit before retreating downstairs again.  Talked a little bit about my culture and Rie with his parents, and got some OJ, mmm.  So...his room again, and after a while we alled up his friends to confirm that we were going to to go the Sooke Potholes.  Set out after changing into our bathing suits, grabbed some towels, and shoved some of my stuff in Fabian's bag.  First stopped at Emma's place right off Rocky Point Road and saw her and Elisa.  Go to pet her sheep, hehe!  Then we drove to Metchosin centre and got some junk food at the store, where my camera ""crapped out""...later found out it was just out of memory.  Damn it!  Drove staright on the Sooke Potholes afetrwrads with Elisa's car in tow, and I learned a little bit about the area,a nd it was a nice drive.  Just leaning on him and playing with his hands for a while, *sigh*.  After going through the beautiful jade forests we got there, and saw Brett and Stephanie with their bikes.  Initially parked in the parking lot, but reparked to the gravelly side of the road as that was free.  It looked a little dangerous though, almost as if the little bug woudl roll off into the river any minute.  But we were fine and started walking towards the Potholes on a gravel trail.     

There were a few shallow places that looked pleasent, but Steph and Brett took us over the hill and down the trail into another section, where there was a shallow bit where one could cross the river, a sandbar, adn then the big hole, a log, and the other side to the hole with a big rock formation you can dive off.  And you could follow an island chain of rocks down to another hole.  There were some logs floating aroudn, and a group of rocks on the trail side you can sit on.  We decided after some hesitation to go across, and brought all the stuff to the rocky beach on the other side. 

Continue later!  Fingers tired, tlakign to Fabian and Reilly.

Current mood: pretty good, had a great day!  and I'm talkjing to Fabian
Current activity: cahttign to Fabers, Reilly
Current sound: nothign, Dad justw ent to his room...nothing but my own voice and typing"

"event","Whee, I'm extremely pleased with how the day has been going.  Compared to yesterday, today has been heaven...but I guess that's not saying much, any day compared to yesterday is just MAGICAL.  Everything has turned out pretty nice today, things are clicking, the sun is shining (a bit too brightly maybe), ""Music"" (Out Of Your Mouth) is playing...it's all good!  Granted, Fabian's at work, but oooh I'll get into him later.  Shh.  Sit still and wait, non-existent readers!  (Wait a minute...Hi Fabers!)  Hmm just finished a phone marathon with Alice/Mary/Sian, trying to see what we're doing tomorrow...I think it'll just be a random jaunt Downtown, heh.  On a more disappointing note, I'm not able to go to Virgin on the 29th to get Megan's Harry Connick Jr. CD signed, nor to Theresa's surprise thing on the 30th because of volunteering.  And ahhh I can't even set out with anyone else on the 31st for the same reaosn, butI'll meet them out there.  I should really start planning for that soon.  I hope that won't conflict with Theresa's dinner either, ...grr, big mess up of things.  

Other big gigantic jumble of events around the beginning of August.  By the way, whoever's reading this...I advise you to go stock up on emergency supplies, water, food, batteries, first aid and the like.  Why?  The world's about to end.  yes, I had chips (gasp!) AND I'm turning down a vacation!  *cries*  Here's the dealio.  I leave for Montreal (applause) on the 11th of August by myself, and my parent's vacation from work lasts from the 5th~15th.  My parents would like to go to either Las Vegas, Yellowstone, or the Rockies with me prior to my trip to Montreal.  Normally, I would be jumping up and down at such an opportunity...I mean, since when do I get TWO vacations in a row??  But here's the catch!  Fabian is supposed to come see the finale show of the Celebration of light with me on August 7th, supposed to be a big ""just us"" thing, and he would stay overnight.  See...the family vacation would be 4 days sort of thing.  Obviously 5~7 won't work...nor will 8~10.  August 7th is smack dab in the middle of everything!  Right now I'm fighting the vacation the best I can while trying to avoid suspisions (since when does Marc turn DOWN vacations???!!!).  My excuse is that I've planned the fireworks outing already, and a giantic group will be attending and I would let everyone down.  I'm also playing on the fact that I haven't been in many years, which is true enough.  But my parents think I'm half-joking, and if they were to go...chances are I'd be forced to go as well, not offered the option of staying alone in Vancouver.  (Though wouldn't that be AWESOME?  Fabian and I by ourselves?!)  So either they'll make me go, or no one will go.  I'm hoping my mom's ...conservative financial views will kick it, but in reality it's a crazy deal, very cheap.  We'll see.  But if that doesn't work out here's my last efforts plans for now:

A) See if there's any way Fabian can be ""sick"" on Saturday the 31st, so he can come when the actual big group thing is happening...I think it's the Swedish fireworks team that day.  I'll just tell my parents I managed to reschedule, and even though I have volunteering that day, I'll just try and switch with someone else!  But I need to know NOW, pretty much...because otherwise I won't be able to switch it.  I'll have to confer with Fabian tonight.  

B) Go to the 31st with the big group and have Fabian come on the...whenever his day off would be, I guess the 2nd and 3rd.  He would have to go home a little early on the 3rd, because he has work at night that day.  I will have to trade with someone for volunteering on the 2nd.  He'll miss the fireworks as well...but there's other excuses he can be in Vancouver for that I can feed to my parents.  There's a music festival here at that time, ic an use that...or just a Maroon 5 concert that they've never heard of, why not?  

Hey if anyone else comes up wiht brilliant ideas, fell free to tell me.  I'm in desperate need of them.

Speaking of Fabian...it's fate!  My dad has switched his schedule recently to ahev Saturdays off, and it starts this week.  So he wants to go somewhere on Saturday (my mom still ahs to work) with me, and he suggested Victoria, because he hasn't been there in a while.  Coincidentally, Fabian's family is going out downtown for soem festival of sorts with their Japanese exchange student.  Normally Fabian has work on saturdays, but his parents are promting him to take that day off to spend the day with them!  FATE I TELLS YOU!  Soooo I'm going to try to get it so that we can spend some time together, and my dad can meet his parents and stuff.  As Alice pointed out earlier, it's rather ..peculiar.  He met my parents on the second date, I met his on the third, and now our parents are meeting, fully unaware that their sons are together.  Lol.  So I'll go through this with him tonight!"

"event","It's starting to rain lightly outside...it's rather perfect when one thinks about it, it compliments my mood, the tears flowing down my face.  I'd like to think that the sky is weeping for me, it feels for me.  The cool breeze floating in alleviates the day's heat and humidity, like a soft blow on a cut from a well meaning mother.  It feels nice.  Yet everything else around here is mocking me, the random remains of my two failed attempts to install a webcam.  My attempts to bring myself closer, they're just...lying there, defunct, unused.  I should clean-up before my parents get home and find this.  When will I feel better?  When will the future seem brighter?  Moping won't do me any good, Brett is right...I'll find ways to cheer myself up somehow, heh.  It's weird that having such an amazing time would make me sad to think about them now."

"event","Ah, Mom's bathtub rinsing operation was up by 8:50, and vaccuming was in full force by 8:55.  That was so annoyingly loud, so I wokr up before 9 this morning, and that annoyed me a little.  Glad to get a start on the day, but I'm not sure I like being forcibly woken up.  Still in a really volatile mood, very pecarious...looks like my mood can go either way from here.  Largely still feeling the same as yesterday, not here nor there...I miss him so much, this is really difficult for me.  I sincerely hope he's getting his appropriate amount of sleep and that he is feeling better than l;ast night.  My poor little Fabers...

So he drove me all the way from Swartz Bay back to Langford, so I could meet whoever was home and drop off my stuff, and see where I would be staying.  The trip back was uneventful, just sorta attached myself to him the whole time, and updated him on a bunch of random events.  Gave him his CD and magnetic poetry when I got in the car, he laughed at th poetry!  Had a fun little time rearranging the words.  He took me by View Royal, it was very rural, not the subrub sort of place I had in mind.  Eventually we saw Canwest, and I told him I had something to get there...just so I could get him to show me where he works!  It was quite amusing, he took me on a tour of Fairway...the ethnic foods, fruit, dog food, fridge...hehe.  Then we went to see the rest of canwest and bumped into his coworker/friend Nicole, who talked for a lonnng time.  She was friendly enough, but we had to arbitrarily break off the conversation.  Turns out she had a crush on Fabers and he told her ""maybe"" when asked for movies...lol!  Silly cow.  Went around the other side of the mall and drove home.  His grandma was there to greet me when we opened the door, along with his very happy little dog, Dusty.  Saw Tristan for a brief second, but he quickly retreated to his room.  Went downstairs to drop off my stuff in his room...his house has a dinstinct pleasent smell, thought the basement had an element of cigarette smoke as well for some reason.  I'll always rememeber that.  The biggest, most pleasent surprise came when I entered hisa room, Fabian immediately shut the door and just grabbed me and kissed me.  

Type later, the bus will come in 10 minutes to take me to Coquitlam Centre..."

"event","So as much as positive/wishful is great. What I need is cash. 

I hate to say it, but I do. 

I have spent the last two days beating myself up about the mistakes I have made financially here, but that's not actually going to solve them. 

What I need is a plane ticket. And sadly I have yet to find an airline that will let me fly for free, so I need to actually buy said plane ticket. And to do that I need money.

So here is my request. Here is me finally admitting(again)that I cannot do this on my own.

I'm willing to work off/pay back anything I borrow once I'm back in Canada. 

Please?"

"event","That's all I have left on my visa. One month. And now I am kinda freaking out. See I moved to Wellington a while back, and I figured living near the capital I would be able to get agency work no problem, put some money away and than be laughing when it came time to buy a plane ticket home.

Only that didn't really happen. Sure I've gotten work, but not much. and the bigger contracts, the ones that would have made it possible to buy my ticket and put money away, they are always the ones that seem to go sideways on me. Like this week, I was supposed to have a one year old for four full days, this would have pretty much covered my fight cost, but than on Thursday I get a text, and than a call, and now I have no work this week. Sure there is a chance I can get another contract this week, but so far nothing, and as much as I am trying to stay calm, I'm not sure I can. 

I feel so incredibly frustrated because I really thought I could make this work. But instead I find myself spending a lot of time questioning my decisions. I have way too much downtime. Way too much time to think. And it's not going well for me. I thought this would work, I really thought that I could make this work, and now I am realizing what a fool I am. And too late. I always figure these things out too late. If it was a simple matter of sustaining myself here I would be fine, but that damned plane ticket is looming over me, and I cannot find a solution. Or when I think I have found one it doesn't work out. I would love to have more work, love to work more with some of the families I worked for, but simply wanting it doesn't make it happen. I can't wish myself work anymore than I can wish myself money. 

So now what? 

Just keep swimming I suppose.

Things will work out."

"event","Well that WAS an adventure...woke up yesterday morning ready for a fun filled relaxing day off...and for the most part the day lived up to expectations...once things got rolling anyway.

My bus was supposed to leave The Mount at 10:20am, at 10:45 one of the girls who was also waiting for the bus starting freaking out. So I went and got my manager to call the bus company to find out what was going on. Close to an hour later they established that our bus forgot to come out to The Mount and had been running on time and therefore it was already long gone. The Bus company's soloution? Put me on the 'next bus' which left at 4:35pm...my tour left Matamata at 4:15, so needless to say that did not work. So they put me in a taxi. Which they footed the bill for(and boy was I grateful they did considering the meter read almost $200 when we arrived at the iSite). I arrived in Matamata for a slightly later than planned lunch and enjoyed some sushi at...well, Hobbit Sushi. Follwed by wandering town for a little bit and enjoying an iced coffee(and the wifi the cafe provided) to kill time until my tour.

So four o'clock rolls around and I check in for my tour. Turns out we will have 9 people all tolled(which is kinda amazing if you ask me...) so we hop onto a big green bus with HOBBITON written across it and head out to the 'Tourist Farm' which of course made me giggle endlessly. Along the way we hear various facts about the farm(including the number of cattle and sheep they currently have) as well as about the area around the farm. It was quite neat. Arrive at the 'Shire's Rest' where James(our guide) jumps on and away we go onto the farm itself. Three gates, two heards of sheep and a bunch of cows later we pull into a carpark...woot! Than we stop for a toilet break, and are informed that if we are looking for the sets of Harry Potter or Game of Thrones we have come to the WRONG place...

And THAN...than we head into The Shire. But of course before entering the Shire we must first do our very best Bilbo impressions with the waving hands and the shouting in order to earn out beer. Most of us compleated this with minimal issue, though one of the Germans looked VERY confused as to what was happening. After this we were shown out first set of Hobbit holes! In three different scales of course. Then we were asked why the Hobbit holes were different sizes...and being the only native english speaker(aside from our guide) it fell on me to explain it...

After that was a whole lot of 'behind the scenes' stories and a request to not take '40 pictures of each Hobbit hole with each of your 5 devices, otherwise there will not be time for beer' So I had to restrict myself...because a drink at the Green Dragon is NOT someting I could risk missing out on. We were shown around the Dell, and up the Great North Road until we crossed the High Road and ended up at Bag End(Stopping for stories AND pictures along the way). After this we looked in on Bagshot Row and played some games under the Party Tree. Than it was a quick walk around the 'Merry Meander', across the bridge and on to the Green Dragon! For a whole half a pint! 

Then it was back around the water and back onto the bus for a stop at the Shire's rest(aka the souvenir shop) before the bus took us back into town. Where I grabbed dinner, and an ice cream and waited for my bus home...and waited...and waitied...and than(close to 45 minutes late) it arrived. 

All in all it WAS an amazing adventure!

"event","Made it back to Sydney, and we all know what that means...it's almost time to hop on a plane. I'm really torn about this, becuase there is one part of me that is really excited to head to New Zealand, and another part of me that doesn't want to leave Australia.

I feel like I spent far too much of my time here worrying about what was next and not enough simply enjoying my travels. Like I could have and should have done things very differently. 

And that is why my plan for New Zealand is different. Rather than getting one job for half(or more) of my trip the new plan is trying to find hostels I can work at in exchange for accomidation, and than other jobs when the time allows. That way I can live in a few different cities and therefore spread myself out so I can see more. At least that is the plan. We'll see how things work once I arrive in Auckland bext week...

So far I am pretty sure I have a hostel to stay at, where for 3 hours of work a day 5 days a week I can stay for free. Once I land I plan to try and find another job asap and stay in Auckland for 2-3 months, after that...well we will see where I can find work and where I feel like going.

I hope to chill out a little more this time around, less stressing about where I am going and what I am doing and more going with the flow. 

I am sad to say goodbye to Australia and the amazing people I have met here...I don't want to go...

But I do want to see what adventures I will get up to next..."

Her words hurt. A lot. And got me wondering if what she was suggesting was true. 

For a few hours I believed her. I allowed all that negaivity into my mind and wondered if I was some if not all of the things she said.

And than I took some time to carefully respond to her.

But that didn't make those questions go away.

And it got me to thinking about how we hide behind screens now, we can say anything we want via technology and never have to see how much it hurts a person. I quick text or email can make, or break, someones day. 

I am no saint. I never claimed to be perfect. I try to be loving and compassionate but there are times, and people, who make it really hard.

"event","Aka Don't budget for money until you have been paid.

This is a little awkward. See my darling exboss has gotten herself into a rather bad situation(or so I have heard through word of mouth) and has therefore decided that paying me all of what she owes me is not possible(or so I assume as she is not answering any of my attempts to contact her). And becuase of that my budget went from 'ok I can do this' to 'holy crap now what?!?' 

See when I left Sydney I had a basic budget in mind, and I thought I was doing ok with it. Until I didn't get all the money I had expected. Now I am trying to figure out how I am going to afford my last few weeks in Australia..let alone arriving in New Zealand. 

So far I have changed some plans in order to save cash, and I'm trying to find the balance between giving things up to save cash and still enjoying my trip. But it's hard. Even cheap accomidation here is not cheap, and as much as I have asked and am staying with friends when I can I do not know people in some places or else the people I know cannot take me in.

I really hate that I have found myself in this situation, I thought I had things sorted when I left Sydney, I thought I would be able to make it until I left for New Zealand with the Australian funds I had, but now I am realising that will not happen. I knew I would need to find a job pretty much upon arrival in New Zealand, and I have started job hunting there already, right now I am just trying to make my money last.

I had been hoping for a miracle, hoping that Mel would come through with the cash, hoping that I would win the lotto or be given money for whatever reason, and than it hit me.

Unless I tell people what is happening they won't know. I have been incredibly fortunate over these past eleven months, when things were not looking good for me somehow they worked out, I was down to the last of my money in Sydeny when I got my job, I had no place to stay but fiends took me in, but I always had to put myself out there and say 'I need help'. 

So this is me saying it. I need help. If anyone wants to help me out in any way, if you know someone who can take me in or wanna send me some cash to help me out just shoot me a message.

Thanks, Cami."

"event","<p>So this last week has been a combination of epically amazing and stressful as hell. Stress was of course work related, epically amazing was of course travel related.</p><p>Mel, my now exboss, had promised to pay me the remaining balance that she owed me by the 7th of July, so when the 13th rolled around and I left on my 3 day camping trip with my bank account at a rather low amount I was slightly stressed to say the least.</p><p>But I was determined to enjoy my trip. The first day went well, fun was had, a rock was photographed and new friends were made. I cannot get over just how amazing and huge Uluru really is...I mean a million pictures could never do it justice. Not that I took quite a full million pictures, but you get the idea. We spent the first night sleeping out under the stars(and disturbingly bright moon) in our swags, freezing but loving it. Hella early wake up call and we were off for a sunrise and a once long hike. Our hike was around Kata Tjuta, which again, no possible way I could begin to do it justice with photos, lets just say you need to see it to fully get it. Popped back to the campsite for lunch and I get a text from a friend. Warning me about all that has gone wrong for Mel since I left. Feeling incredibly disheartened I turn to one of the ladies in our group and tell her whats going on. She and I talk for a bit, more about the kids than my financial concerns, and than we are off on another long drive to Kings creeks station, which is near Kings Canyon. </p><p>That night around the fire we sang a rather awkward rendition of Waltzing Matilda(no one could agree of the words) and exchanged our favourite quotes. Heart to hearts followed and an amazing night was had. Also I managed to successfully find the Southern Cross with no help! </p><p>Another long hike through Kings Canyon, and than back to the station for lunch and clean up and coffee. We enjoyed a long drive to the roadhouse, than off to a camel farm, where I almost got bitten by an emu, before the final trek home. Went out for dinner with some of the girls, and drinks of course. </p><p>Got back to Alice and checked my accounts to find that Mel had deposited part of my pay...so that's better than I was expecting, though still leaves me a bit tight...so I am replanning some things, and couching it a bit more than initially planned. </p><p>Now I am in Darwin, which is strangely small townish, but still enjoyable. I have swam everyday so far and love it! Tomorrow I'm heading to Litchfield for a day trip, than Tuesday I shall tourist it up and visit the croc cave and maybe the lagoon again before hopping back on the train...woot. </p>"

So I emailed the guy while I was in Perth and he got back to me and we set everything up for him to pick me up at my hostel today.</p><p>He gets here and I find out that I get a private tour!</p><p>Start off with all the usual forms and info, than off we go. Get down to Redgate Beach and get dressed in my wetsuit, walk down to the beach and enjoyed almost 2 hours of private surf lessons! In that time I realised just how out of shape I have let myself become, because wow was I tired. My arms/shoulders are killing me now. BUT I did manage to get myself standing a few times, and even paddled in to a few waves(as opposed to being pushed in by my instructor). I also managed to fall down a tonne! And that was kinda fun too. </p><p>After I was throughly exhausted we went back to the van for a 'shower' which pretty much involved having warm water dumped over me as I stripped off the wetsuit, and got changed. Than off for coffee and a wander through an art gallery/shoppe, which was also amazingly cool. </p><p>We had a quick lunch chilling on a random turnoff in the midst of one of the coolest forests I have ever seen, and than went for the tour of Lakes Cave. Which was predictably amazing(though exhausting, because STAIRS!). </p><p>All in all a wonderfully amazing, and tiring day. </p>"

Which is good, because the trip would not have been nearly as enjoyable if we had not.

It wasn't actually my seat, but there was no one in those seats, so I took the empty seats and spread myself out to sleep, it was a pretty good set up(that luckily panned out all three nights!)</p><p>The first part if the trip was fairly uneventful, mostly just watching the 'mountains' roll by and wondering if we would make it out of Sydney before sunset. Had dinner, and than got ready for bed and slept. Rather uneventful really. </p><p>The next morning we were up early and in Broken Hill, we had a choice to take a 'whistle stop' tour, but I wanted to simply take a walk and find some breakfast and coffee. Once we found those I wandered into the middle of the street:</p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/camibouchard/604462/1132/1132_original.jpg""></p><p>And enjoyed the sunrise. </p><p>After Broken Hill we were back on the train for a short ride to Adelaide. Where I again took a short walk and picked up 'supplies' for the next leg of the journey, that of course included coke and chocolate. Because of course I wanted to eat healthy while on the train.</p><p>After Adelaide I had a train shower, which was rather unexciting. Though the fun challenge was 'don't grab the shower curtain when falling' because that could have been really bad. After that I managed to sleep quite well. </p><p>And in the morning I awoke to slight hills, and than lots of flat.<br></p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/camibouchard/604462/1342/1342_original.jpg""></p><p>And lots of flat</p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/camibouchard/604462/1678/1678_original.jpg""></p><p>And than flatter flat</p><p><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/camibouchard/604462/1794/1794_original.jpg""></p><p>Until we reached the thriving metropolis of Cook.

Found my way into Perth with some help(and some friends) dropped my stuff in the hostel and wandered the city. Before finding my way into Supanova Perth and seeing the John Barrowman panel...yet again. It was so different from the Sydney one, which was nice, because it would have been disappointing if it had been exactly the same. </p><p>Now I am sitting in my hostel room, avoiding the rain, and debating going to find food.

And I am actually feeling kinda sad to go.

Though I keep being told that Perth is 'amazing' so that's good. I am glad I am not planning on riding a train across the country to a place people describe as 'horrible' or anything. 

Hour and a bit to go before I check in. than we leave in just over two hours. So crazy to think that I am finally going to be MOVING again! I have loved my time here in Sydney, but at the same time I have been itching to head out for a while now. Off to my next adventure and so on. 

The next few days should be interesting for sure, couple days on the train, couple days in the city, and than on to buses and further travels. I am in some ways relieved that I have most of the first part of the trip booked already. No stressing or worrying about 'what next'. I just need to follow my itinerary and hope I don't get too badly lost. 

Also I am REALLY tired. Between last weekend and the fact that the kids(and I) didn't sleep well last night, I am exhausted. Not that it was at all surprising that no one slept, but it still sucked. Oh well. I will have plenty of time to sleep on the train.

It isn't the parents who drive me mental, or the strange expectations/requests. 

It isn't even the hours(though sometimes I feel as though my workday is never ending...)

No it's having to let go, walk away, and hope that things work out.

Becuase sometimes that is what I need to do. And in this case, I hate it.

This family I am with now has been an experience. There have been up and downs and days when I wonder why I haven't walked away before. There have been times when I have wanted so badly to walk away, and yet I can't. Becuase it's not fair. Not to my boss, I am so over trying to be 'fair' with her, because she doesn't seem to care about that. It's the kids. That is why I do this job. Not to make the parents lives easier, but to try and make the kids lives better. To try and offer them some fun, some learning, and in this case some stability. 

Ans now I have to move on.

Technically my contract was up over 3 weeks ago. I am here for just over another week. And the more I hear about the moms 'plans' once I leave...well lets just say if my trains/hostels/buses/etc were not already booked I might just stay. Hell even with everything planned I almost wish I could stay. 

Sometimes when I leave it's easy(er), I know the kids are in a positive environment, they have parents who are genuinely concerned about their wellbeing, they have care set up in a positive environment, and they will continue to grow and thrive once I leave. And therefore as much as it saddens me to say goodbye, I know I do not need to worry.

But as I come to a close with this family...as I prepare to say goodbye to these two boys who are at times so wonderful and at times so horridly behaved. I cannot help but worry. There is so much in thier lives that is so unstable right now, and one of the few constants for them...well I am leaving. 

But this is what I need to do. Because at the end of the day, I need to live my life as I planned, and leave other people to live thiers."

I have just 2 and a half weeks left here in Sydney, than it's off to Perth and Adelaide, and Alice, and Darwin, and Melbourne, and...well I don't even know. I haven't really figured any of that out yet. But I do know I need to be back in Sydney for the 3rd of September and...New Zealand!

It's so crazy to think about. I mean honestly. I spend a lot of time simply not thinking about it because there is so much excitement and awe in the fact that not only am I here in Australia...but next I am heading to New Zealand. And after that? Well after that will no doubt sort itself out in time. Part of me wants to panic about the 'after' and part of me is just curious to see what happens next...

But first I need to get through now. 

And right now I have a very long couple of weeks ahead of me. My boss is heading to Singapore for work, so I will have the kids for two weeks, with school being the only 'break' I will get. Well and nap time. God bless nap time. She will come back on the 16th, go to court on the 17th, and I board the Indian Pacific on the 18th. I dare say I should sleep well on the train! 

I have worked jobs with overnights before...but never have I needed to work close to two weeks straight like this. 

It should be fun, the boys are actually excited that I will be staying longer than planned, and have lots of ideas for what we should do when mommy is away. I am more worried about her than the kids most of the time. Nothing can be settled until the courtdate, and even then they may postpone until the end of July, and in that case she will no doubt be finding another nanny to take my job. Which I cannot imagine will be easy on the kids. And that is who I worry about in the long run.

"event","Thats how long I have left with this job. Than the family I am working for is relocating. Officially. Or at least I made it official. My boss has been less than decisive, so I said fine, and informed her that as of the 31st of May I would be gone.

Than I put up an advert on gumtree.

And the next day got a call.

So next saturday I have an interview. 

I am somewhere between excited and terrified. Interviews make me so nervous. I mean the mom sounded nice, we talked for close to half an hour over the phone. She texted me a picture of her little girl. This could be so perfect. Such a nice normal end to my work in this country. And I think that is what scares me so much. Would it be too much to ask? This randomly perfect job coming up right after I find out that I am suddenly unemployed. I'm not sure. But if it does work out...well that would be amazing.

Meanwhile I need to make it through the next three weeks here. Hopefully the worst is now behind me as this last week was terrible. But of course by thinking that I no doubt cursed myself to further hell. 

Also really need to sort out my travel plans...and start actually booking stuffs. Only six and a half weeks until I board a train...and start to actually travel again. It seems weird in some ways. But at the same time I cannot wait to get going!

Edit:
Oh would you look at that. Boss comes out of her room as I am trying to go to bed and informs me that she has too much to do and therefore quit her job. So three weeks of mommy days. But it's ok I can just make her breakfast same as boys. Still don't quite understand why she is incapable of getting her kids ready in the morning if she isn't working...but hey, I am just the nanny. Heaven forbid I comment on that. Oh wait I did and got a lecture on how I need to be more understanding because she has a lot to do and it is very stressful for her right now. To which it took everything in me not to respond with a resounding 'bite me bitch'. 

I offically hate my life."

"event","Sometimes things happen that make you wonder. My boss made a slightly shocking announcement to me on Sunday night. One than made me wonder if I should panic or praise God. 

It looks like I WILL be done work as of the 31st of May. Which means I will have to find something to do with myself from the 1st of June until the 18th when my train leaves for Perth. So now what...what am I going to be doing for those 2 and a half weeks...I'll have to find a place to stay first, which begs the question...do I stay in Sydney...or do a little pretrip travel? And if so where should I go? What should I do? 

I don't know. I feel relieved to know that I will be done this job soon...but also a little unsettled knowing I don't know what I am doing for those two weeks I wasn't planning to have off...

Plus there is the fact that my boss could once again change her mind and all these though could be for naught..."

"event","Wow.

So. I went to a hockey game tonight. It made me both very happy, and a little sad. The hockey itself wasn't bad persay. Not really amazing, but good grinding hockey. A bit of a blow out as the final was 8-1, but still a decent game. 

Walking into the rink was amazing. As crazy as this may sound, it smelt right. And felt right. Up until I realised there was no glass around the rink. That was a little weird. Also the fact that the public skating session ended about 20 minutes before the puck dropped. And NONE of the players were wearing suits as they wandered into the rink, trackies and thongs were the usual choice of attire. 

They set up nets around the rink, in place of the glass, but left openings for the players to get in and out of. The 'benches' were actually just benches pulled over next to the boards from the public skating session, and there were no actual penalty boxes. Oh and if a fan needed to use the toilet they had to walk through the player benches. That was fun. 

Once the game got started it was good. Nice and tight for the first while, but it was easy to see which was the better team(And who had the better goalie, and by that I mean the goalie who actualy played goal and didn't try an jump into the play at the blue line). 

It felt good to be there. Watching the game. But it also made me feel a little sad. Made me miss all the nights I have spent at rinks with friends watching games. Made me miss the fun rivalry that hockey encourages. I think thats what I miss most right now, spending time with people who share my interests, people whom I can discuss hockey with, discuss the shows I love to watch and the books I love to read with. 

Ah well. It was a good night all in all. And I look forward to hitting the rink again next week for the preseason final!"

Ok so really I should't complain. Compared to some of the other travel associates I have had to deal with the lady from Great Southern Rail was actually quite nice. She was impressed that I was 'so together' with my plans and aside from one confusing moment where she thought she needed to transfer my call only to realise that she didn't, there was little to no issue. 

Twenty odd minutes and ninty eight dollars in 'fule surcharge' later and I am offically booked to spend 9 nights all tolled sleeping on train in June and July. The first leg will be the longest, I had a chance to break it up, but decided if I am going to do the Indian Pacific, I am going to do it right. Straight through. Four days and three nights on a train! With a two-four hour layby each day in various cities along the way of course! I am only allowed 'hand luggage' on the train, and they suggest I bring a blanket, though they will provide me with a towel for showers, and they encourage customers to shower at least once while on the train. Umm...wasn't sure how to respond to that, but I thanked her for the advice. 

The only awkwardly timed departure is from Kalgoorlie, we depart at 1:20am, so I need to be at the train station 'by midnight' so that I will be ready to board the trian(and than sleep me thinks!). Eveyrthing else should be easy peasy. 

I am crazy excited about all this, not only because it represents the next leg in my journey, but also becuase, well I am really a child in the fact that I LOVE trains! And I am curious as to what kind of people I will meet spending THAT much time on one train. 

Over the next little while I will be booking various aspects of my upcoming trip, and as much as I worry about all the things that could(and no doubt will) go wrong I cannot help but enjoy the childish excitment that I feel just thinking about climbing on that train and heading off to my next big anventure!"

"event","So yesterday I applied for my visa. I have probably checked the 'status' on said application 15 times in the past 24 hours. And it still says pending. I suppose I shouldn't worry too much. Its only been a day. But part of me is kinda freaking out. Which is funny because I almost didn't apply because I was thinking about just going home. Which is still the plan if my visa doesn't pan out. 

I know I was worried when I applied for my Aussie visa, but I was really lucky because that was decided in a matter of hours. Whereas it looks like New Zealand may actually use the '3-5 business days' to decide. I suppose I can start to worry if I don't hear anything in a week. 

I don't wait well though. I am not a patient person. And therefore I do not like this feeling of '...pending'."

Well see thats what I am struggling with at the moment. 

I started the application for my visa for New Zealand today, but as I was going to submit it I kind of panicked and just saved it instead. It seems weird to me that I would suddenly be doubting my plan to head to NZ next. It's what I had hoped to have planned since pretty much the outset on this trip, it's logical to head there next as it is close, and I can once again get the one year work/travel visa that will allow me to split my time and have more time to enjoy the country(and possibly make more money for onward travel again...). But part of me freaked out. 

One part of me feels like I should go home. Like it would be safer to just go back to Canada and try and find work there. So I could be close to the friends and family that I miss. So that I would be closer to the safety net of life at home. 

But than another part of my brain calls that a cop out and wonders where my sense of adventure went. 

I plan to decide by the end of the month for sure...but for now...I guess I'll just pray about it..."

"event","So for the past while here things have been more than a little tense. Work has been crazy stressful, and I have not been a very happy Cami. 

And than this happened.

This weekend was amazing. Seriously. Once it got underway anyway. I was annoyed that I had to push back(and rebook) my bus ticket because despite rechecking with my boss multiple times I did have to work on friday. But in the end that wasn't too big of a deal. Finally on the bus I enjoyed some defrag time listening to hockey and watching Sherlock and chatting with friends on the amazing free wifi(Thank you Greyhound!). Got into Canberra and got scooped up by my amazing Badger Buddy Malou, who graciously offered me not only a bed to sleep in, but also a tour guide and chauffeur for the weekend. The rest of friday was spent laughing and talking and pretty much just relaxing(and eating and drinking tea!).

Saturday was not quite what we had planned, but once we sorted things out(like the date) we headed to the National Canberra Ehxibition, and I got all educated on Canberra and why it is where it is and why it's built the way it is and how to build various buildings here out of lego. Also got to see the Canadian Flag Pole, which was at that time sadly flagless. After that I headed to the Inca exhibit at the Australian National Gallery and saw a whole TONNE of artwork and such, and than had an amazing lunch, with Malou, of course. After which we went for a lovely walk where we saw the Flags, and the fountain and the silly lazy tourists taking the Segway tours. We met a nice bloke who asked if I had stolen Merry from someone back home and only managed to get slightly lost on our way back to the car. Next we headed to the War Memorial. Which pretty much blew my mind. We stayed there right though the closing ceremonies, where we got to hear the national anthem and a story of one of the people on the wall of rememberance. After that we headed back to the house for dinner and a crazy kangaroo filled walk. Got to see lots of kangaroos in their natural habitat, and even a little joey in his mommys pouch! It was all rather exciting. 

Sunday was Australia Day, so we started out with a good Aussie brekkie and than went to watch the flag raising ceremony(they put the flag on the Canadian Flag Pole(!) and shot off a 21 gun slaute, while airplanes and bats flew overhead. It was amazing and terrifying all at the same time. When that was over we wandered around, got some snacks(yummy fresh peaches), and than headed over to the Canberra Museum, for further educating(and a blissfully shortlived incarceration in leg irons). Than it was back to see more Australia Day celebration stuff, and get snack foods, before heading up ""Mount"" Ainslie. Lol. It's such a cute little mountain! But it afforded some amazing views, I'll say that much. Sunday night we went to a Laos fundraiser where we got to see(and do) some dancing, have some foods, and watch a fasion show. It really was a lot of fun. And by the end of the day we were all exhausted.

Today was a much more chill day, off to a late start we headed to the (New) Parliament House for a walking tour, than pancakes for lunch before the Greyhound home. 

All in all this was a really amazing weekend. So many laughs and so much fun was had. I really look forward to next time...when we see all the other stuff that I missed."

"event","First off I want to say that Hunter Valley is beautiful and home to many amazing winerys. Secodnly I would like to point out that because of that fact going on a 'family holiday' there seems a little silly in my mind. Thirdly, I dare say I have been quite spoiled in the past with the way my employers have treated while on vacations. 

The drive up was rather chaotic, she didn't actually hit anything but we came scary close more than a couple times. Plus we managed to get lost, despite my best efforts to keep us on track. Finally checked in we stayed for about an hour before heading out to find a chocolate factory, where we had chocolate covered strawberries followed by a sampling of sparkling wines(and of course the purchasing some of said wines). All of which were very sweet, but enjoyable. After that we headed to a cheese factory where we didn't actually eat cheese but instead got gelato for the boys. Stopped into a tea and jam shop, where more samples were had, and than to a gift shop(where the boys and I sat on the 'gentalmans seat' and waited as patiently as we could). Than we went for a bit of a drive to figure out where we would go today. Saw some bounding kangaroos along the way, which was quite exciting. Than off to dinner at a Japanese/Thai restraunt. We ended the evening with the light display at the Hunter Valley Gardens, which was beautiful. 

This morning began with a swim than cleaning and finally we headed out to find more wine, cheese and chocolates. We stopped in at the Hunter Valley Gardens again, where I picked up another bottle of wine, as well as a couple bottles of gluten free beer! Before heading to the McGuigan winery for further tastings(and purchasing) as well as another cheese factory. Doubled back for futher bottles of sparkling wine and cider. And than decided the boys had had enough and grabbed lunch at Subway before heading home. 

I must say I am very happy to be home, and very much looking forward to getting back to regular for the week, or regularish anyway. And even more so looking forward to this coming weekend!"

So my boss decided we should go to Hunter Valley. For the night. Tomorrow. 

Granted she did give me about a couple weeks notice that we would be going. But still. Today she told me when we were leaving, where we are staying and what we will be doing. Looks like we will be staying for around 24 hours all tolled, visiting a chocolate factory, a cheese factory, and I might be able to grab a sip(and buy a bottle) of wine if time permits. There will be a pool at the hotel so I need to bring my swimmers and I am on pancake duty come Sunday morning. 

Oh and we will be seeing the Christmas lights.

Considering the week I've had I am not looking forward to this nearly as much as I should be. 

But seeing as I probably wouldn't be going to Hunter Valley if left on my own, I shouldn't complain. 

Though I may feel differently while we are driving up tomorrow, because quite frankly her driving terrifies me."

"event","So I have been spending a great deal of time thinking 'What am I going to do after New Zealand' and than I realised I should first plan New Zealand...and than it struck me. I still have the rest of Australia to see(parts of) before I do anything else...so first things first.

I sat down with my rail pass and my travel guide(and of course my iPad) and started 'planning' just basic ideas at first. Figuring out when I 'needed' to be where and where exactly I wanted to visit. And I very quickly started to panic...see Australia is a rather large country...and I have hardly scratched the surface. I am once again facing the whole 'you can't really do everything' issue. I'm thinking even if I had magically found a way to travel for the full year I wouldn't have been able to do 'everything' by my definition and that makes me feel a bit better...lol. But at the same time having three months to do most of the country...maybe not the best idea. Also getting around in Western Australia without a car could prove to be a challange. I think I've managed to plan in such a way that I can see most of what I want to, but will it work out in the long run? I donno. I'm somewhere between hoping it does, and wondering what will happen if it doesn't. Maybe things will work out even better than my best plans? 

Luckily I have a few months to nail things down, at least the things that need to be nailed down, like the buses and trains that only run once a week, and the tours that I want to do. Oh and my SupaNova tickets...

My biggest challange at the moment seems to be time...I have almost exactly three months to visit a huge area. I have about 5 weeks dedicated to WA, two for the NT and that leaves me with around 6 weeks to do SA and Vic and make my way back to Sydney fo a flight to...? Well we will see to that later."

"event","And yet it still doesn't feel like the holidays to me. We went looking at Christmas lights tonight, last night we enjoyed the lights in the city, the night before that we got to watch the Tom-Hanks-A-Thon that usually signifies the beginning of December, and yet still...it doesn't feel like Christmas. 

This is a season of family and friends. And more than anything I feel guilty. I feel like I should be home. I should be there for family, for friends, for the laughter and fun(and drama), and all the other things that symbolise this crazy time of year. But I can't be. No. I choose not to be. When I decided to come to Australia I didn't have to come for a year, I choose to. I decided that rather than just a few months I wanted to take this step and try for something different. And wow. So many amazing things have happened. I've met some amazing people, had some amazing adventures. Things have sucked too. But all in all I'm glad I decided to do this. No regrets. 

But sadness is allowed sometimes. And I feel it creeping in. Because this year I won't be home for Christmas. This year I won't get to sit on the couch and read the Grinch with my sibs. I won't be doing a last minute panic shop for dinner stuff with my mom. There will be no laughs at my fathers desperate attempts to fill my moms stocking(and mom I'm sorry if it kinda sucks this year). No family dinner. No hiding in my moms bedroom. 

But instead I'll get new memories, new people to make memories with. On Christmas Eve I get to be the one of turkey duty(scary thought I know!), the family I'm working with is planning to attend mass, and than go looking at Christmas lights. On Christmas Day a friend graciously invited me to join her extended family for the day. And Boxing Day will(hopefully) include a screening of The Hobbit! 

So here is to new memories, new opportunities and new memories to be made. I wish all my friends and family back home a very Merry Christmas, and as much as I hope you are missing me as much as I am missing you, I hope you are also having an amazing holiday!"

"event","So for years now I have been talking about it. My 'grand adventure' of a life time. My crazy stupid idea that once I got down here I would make my way back home with two rules in mind...head west, and no planes. 

And the more I'm here the more I want to...

This is crazy right? How am I going to get out of Australia? There is a lot of water between here and Asia and a lot of Asia between here and Europe...and than there is the Atlantic...and pretty much all of North America to navigate. 

There is a lot of climates to deal with, and cultures. Plus there is the fact that I would want to take a whole lot of time(and let's be honest here, money). And it would mean missing my friends for even longer than planned. 

There is also the fact that New Zealand is the wrong way...and I kinda wanna go there too...

In some ways there are so many reasons to write this off as a crazy idea. But...that's kinda why I want to try. Does that make any sense? 

Don't anyone panic just yet. This is still in the very early stages of an idea. A small seed that was planted in my mind a long while back. And is very slowly pushing it's way back to the surface. Where it will either grow and flourish or die in the aggressive sun that is reality. Not sure what the outcome will be yet. Probably won't know for a long while. Consider this fair warning for the possibility of further crazy talk."

"event","So...the house that I am working at. They have a renter. A girl who rents the spare room. In theory this doesn't effect me at all. She does her thing, I do mine, fine whatever. But today she managed to piss me off a few times. First off I get a text from my boss informing me that this other girl is breaking the rules by having her boyfriend overnight and asks me to knock in her door as she isn't answering her phone. Not my job. Not my problem. So in the midst of morning routine I tap on her door, no response. Fine by me. Not my problem anyway. And therefore I continue my morning. Take Max to school, bring Matthew back home to finish his breakfast. So I'm supervising breakfast while doing the morning cleaning and the renter comes down, glares at me, grabs some food than takes it back up to her room. Ok I get it. As far as she is concerned I overstepped my bounds by knocking on her door. An hour later as Matthew and I are finally finishing everything up, and getting ready to head out for a 'grand adventure' she comes downstairs with the aforementioned boyfriend who 'arrived really early in the morning and didn't stay the night'. This time she doesn't even acknowledge me. But whatever we are about to leave anyway. Off we go to the mall. When we come home there are dishes half done and the kitchen is a mess. When we left everything was clean. Now, not so much. And she is gone. So I clean everything back up, make lunch, etc. Pick up Max from school, come home, things are fine. I make dinner and(for once) there is minimal fighting from either child over eating! Clean everything back up while the boys take their bath. After they are done I clean all the water up(because two boys in a bath=lots of splashing) and make sure things are tidy. My boss gets home, everything is clean, life is good. I stay and talk a bit than head up to my room so she can have some time with the boys. I hear the renter get home, I hear the renter complain about the fact that I 'never take the kids anywhere' and than get in the shower. Now we share a bathroom, her, me and the kids. She complained about the fact that the bathroom was a mess just after I got here, ever since I have been careful to make sure it's clean(and I really hate cleaning bathrooms). So I go to get ready for bed, walk into the bathroom and swear. The floor is covered in water(worse than it was post boys). There are towels in the sink and tub. Not entirely sure what she was doing...but seriously?!? Is she trying to piss me off to 'get back' at me for this morning? Or is she just that inconsiderate? Which ever it is if it continues I'm going to have to talk to my boss...and I don't want to do that, because as I said...renter is NOT my problem."

"event","Today I attended church for the first time since I arrived in Australia. I kept meaning to attend...but somehow it didn't happen. 

Rewind to yesterday. Mel, my boss, asked if I found a church to attend, and than proceeded to tell me about the bug famous church not far away. I had wanted to try and attend Hillsong while I was in Sydney, and now I find myself a mere 3 kilometers from it. So of course I had to go.

The church itself is a little intimidating I'll be honest. It's huge and busy. The kind of church you can attend without talking to anyone, or so I thought. I slipped through the foyer into the auditorium with barely a 'hello' exchanged. Found a seat in the huge auditorium and sat back to read the newspaper that is their bulliten. The place was buzzing! So many people coming and going as I choose to attend the later morning service. I was surprised to find myself approached by three different people in 'volunteer' shirts greeting me and welcoming me. 

As the service time neared I was a little shocked at how many empty seats there were. But of course it filled right up by the end of the first song. The music was amazing! But really what else would you expect at the Hillsong church? 

The sermon was deliverd by a visiting pastor from Wales. He opend with a song and some jokes. Threatened a sermon with 75 points, and than settled in on two. He spoke on Bartameus(the blind begger) and standing up to bullies. He spoke against religion, and for belief. Grace over guilt. Forgiveness over failure. And than the guilt and shame that society places on Christians who sin. And how we need to stand up and remember that Christ didn't die pointing a finger of accusation, but rather with his arms wide open in forgiveness. 

The service wrapped up with another couple songs, and a more prayers for the world and all that has gone wrong in it over the past few weeks. 

It was an amazing experience. And I look forward to returning for as long as I am out here. And maybe even networking at some point. Lol."

"event","So...I have a job...ish.

I have a place to stay temporarily where I can work off my room and board. So far it's involved an hour and a half of watching a child watch tv, and a whole lot of dishes. Not complaining, just saying.

Problem is I'm still not making any money. 

Of course I'm also spending less...so it kind of works out.

I feel stuck right now. Like I have to be here because I can't be anywhere else. And it's kinda true. I can't afford to live in a hostel right now. I can't afford to do much right now. I overshot my budget with the hopes of quick employment here...only that didn't work. And now I'm about as broke as I've ever been. And feeling very alone. And it kills me that I feel so negative, but I do. I have been emailing people for two weeks, I've probably contacted 30-40 families, as well as three separate agencies...I have heard back from 3 families, had one interview, and got turned down. The one agency I spoke to was a joke, the other requires me to do classes with them...classes that don't start until next Saturday. So nannying seems to be out...I can't keep waiting for work. I don't have the money for that. 

But my other choice is to try and find a flat and a job...which means I'll have to try and contact more people and pray they get back to me, come up with the money for rent, AND find a job. All while staying where I am and working for the rent I am paying here. I feel like it's all too much. Too complicated. Why does everything feel so hard? 

I think whats bothering me most is the fact that I'm now regretting the traveling that I did. I'm thinking I should have just stayed in Sydney from the start. Focused first on the working than on the traveling. But I don't want to think that way. I loved my trip. I had fun. Met awesome people. Experienced some stress. But nothing like this. After the work related waiting games that 45 minutes on hold with Queensland rail seems like seconds. The extra night in Airlie wasn't so bad really. Having to leave Surfers and Byron early because of other commitments was no big deal. It was fun. 

And months from now this whole ordeal will be just another part of the trip. Something to look back on and wonder why I got so worked up about it. I mean really I haven't gone homeless yet. I've had roofs over my head and food in my stomach every night. I just wish I had a little more money in hand...or at the very least knew when money was coming in. Because I think that's what's bugging me right now. There is no living paycheque to paycheque when you don't have a job...and as much as I was used to that life it did nothing to prepare me for this."

"event","I'm terrible at waiting. I hate vague plans. 'Sometime in the afternoon' is not an appropriate answer to me. So the fact that I am stuck waiting...and waiting...for someone to get back to me so that we can meet so that I can possibly maybe move in with them is killing me. 

Ok so I'm being melodramatic...but I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

I'm so tired of having little to no control. I'm so tired of having to wait for people to possibly get back to me. And I'm really annoyed at how often people just don't bother to get back to me. 

I want so badly to start moving forward with my plans while I am here in Sydney, but I can't until something starts to happen. Too bad nothing seems to be happening. 

I'm just stuck waiting for unknown amounts of time hoping that people who say they are going to call me do. But I don't even know if they will because it's happened before where people are all 'oh I'll call you at such and such a time' and than I don't hear from them. 

I feel so helpless right now. So out of control. 

I can't stand this feeling."

"event","So I was so excited for this interview I had arranged for today. Meeting with an agency that promised they should be able to place me in 3-5 days, lots of jobs to be had, etc. Well I travel 45 minutes to the interview and find out that she is interviewing two people at once, well ok, not what I was expecting, but sure. So I sit down, she asks me two questions, hands me a piece of paper and leaves. But first she recanted every statement she had previously made about the jobs. 

I'm not even exaggerating. I spoke to her for maybe ten minutes. Than she took off like she had a million other more important places to be. 

I was shocked, and incredibly disappointed. I mean I thought that going through an agency would make things easier. Sit down with her, get a feel for what she expected, what the family's would expect. Maybe get an idea of who was hiring right now. But instead I got this. She pretty much said there is little to no hope of finding work until late January...anywhere...so just go travel and contact her when we got back. Too bad that's not an option for me. But oh you know if only I'd been in town a couple weeks ago, she had a few families than...but she already placed girls with them. 

I felt decieved. Honestly. Like she had talked herself and her agency up far beyond what it really is and I foolishly believed her. So now I'm pretty much back to square one. I had one interview yesterday, and that felt good, but they are 'talking to other people' today and wil get back to me later in the week. So I'm not holding my breath. I've done that before and I hate the let down. I want the job, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to count on anything. 

This is not going as I hoped. I hoped I would find work quickly, or at least find offers quickly, but there isn't much. And no one seems to want me."

I miss working. Is that wired? I mean don't get me wrong travelling has been amazing and I have loved most of the last two months and all the chaotic adventures I've had, but the concept of sleeping in the same bed for more than five nights and being able to put my laundry somewhere besides back in my pack is actually exciting to me now. 

And part of me is sad. If I'm not in hostels I won't have the chance to meet all the awesome people I've been meeting. No more being pestered into drinking...no more listening to people snore, or talk in their sleep...no more strange boys waking me up when they come in drunk...the idea of not sharing my room seems odd now.

Part of me is just planning what's beyond work. Heading to the west coast and so on. Which will be amazing but first let's focus on the task at hand...find a job."

I keep sending email after email and I've hardly heard a thing back. And the one lady I did hear from sent up so many red flags that it almost scares me. 

Maybe this is a sign. Maybe this is proof that I should not nanny hear. I should just give up and do something else. Find a differnt job. Maybe something in retail? I'm not sure. I really wish there was a way for me to get paid for not doing anything, just a regular biweekly cheque arriving in my account so I could continue to travel and enjoy myself, only with an income.

So call in get put on hold...put on hold...than put back on hold. Finally talking to the nice lady and she informs me that my pass is not valid. I inform her that it is and up back on hold while she talks to her supervisor and low my pass is valid. But not useable yet...oh no we need to validate it. So I'm back on hold. And again. Read off a few dozen different sets of numbers(I may be exaggerating that slightly, but not the rest I swear!). Sit on hold again. And finally...I have my ticket for tomorrow booked...but on Monday I have to go in to an 'actual office' and actually validate it...but I get to ride the bus tomorrow...so that's the important part. 

So I thought booking my rail passes like I did would make things less stressful...instead I spend 20 minutes on hold(which is considerably less that QR, but still annoying). 

Oh well at least they are honouring my pass...thank god. 

In other news...still waiting to hear back from people I emailed. Mostly I'm emailing people in Sydney now, because the people here in Brisbane area haven't been getting back to me.

"event","Honestly the last few days I have been feeling lost. And annoyed with myself. I've not been doing much, mostly sitting and reading and pretending I hate the world. Or maybe just hating the world. And it doesn't really make a lot of sense, ok fine so I didn't get the job. Sure I'm annoyed because I cut short other parts of my trip to come down here and do this..but it's not the end of the world. I wasn't even sure what I was doing up there anyway. 

And I'm sure I'll be able to find more beautiful beaches to sit on. I mean I'm in Australia. It's kinda beachy around here. Well maybe not here in Brisbane, but in general. 

So I need to decide what happens now...do I stay here a while longer..see if any of the other people I emailed get back to me...or do I just cut ties and run. Bounce down the coast thriftily until I land in Sydney and pray to God I can land a job there before I run out of money...

And that's a tough choice, I mean much tougher than I thought it might be. I guess worst case if Sydney doesn't work out I can hop a train and head to Perth...I got a few job offers out there before...maybe something will pan out there. 

I think my problem isn't the lack of choices...it's the overabundance. There is no reason for me to be anywhere at this point. I could(technically) go anywhere...I don't have to be here for this or there for that. No holidays, no plans. Just...freedom. And that is scary. And it annoys me that I'm terrified by it. 

I was so excited to just travel and not plan...now my lack of plans is freakimg me out. Brilliant."

I mean they want the best for their kids, but it bugs me because she made it almost sound like I had the job before we even met, and than...rejection.

Am I upset? Ya a little. Annoyed that I came down to Bris early only to be rejected, but maybe this is just setting me up for something better? I posted an ad for Sydney this morning. Maybe things will work better there? I donno. 

I do know this though...I'm going to start running out of money soon. And when that happens...well I'm not sure what I'm going to do. Look harder for work I guess. Though I would like to find work before I run out of money...it's accommodation that's killing me. It's so expensive everywhere...and it's driving me crazy! 

But that's one of those expenses that I kinda have to just deal with. Or maybe find a way to stay somewhere free? That would be a good idea. One less expense...of course making money would be even better..ugh. I hate how everything seems to come down to cash...

Hell this entire post has turned out to be about cash...

Oh well. I'm gonna go and see what I can see around the city. Booked in a couple more nights here than heading further south....and...well I donno...hopefully finding work in or around Sydney...or maybe I'll just hop the train to Perth once I'm there...three nights free accommodation if I do that...not in a bed...but somewhere to sleep none the less..."

"event","So honestly when I planned this trip the whole 'oh ya I'll find work' part of my planning was...well nonexistent really. I figured once I was nice and broke I would figure out a job and go from there. But this is me and I started panicking when I realised I was now entering my second month with high expenses and zero income. So I threw a couple emails out in response to ads people had posted and crossed my fingers. After a couple rounds of nos I decided I had two choices...panic or just head south and hope something worked out. 

And than my cell rang. 

It scared me really. Hearing it ring. That's not something that happens...well ever really here. 

And there was a nice, albeit rushed sounding woman on the other end 'you had emailed me about an au pair job...the other girl...she didn't feel comfortable changing nappies...will you be in Bris this weekend?' 

So Sunday afternoon I am going for a job interview...if I get it I start Monday. 

And that's how quickly plans can change. I was thinking maybe a week in Bris at this point before heading further south, now(if I do get this job) I'll be there minimum 3 months. I'll be living in an actual house, with my own(non bunk) bed, and my own bathroom! I will be welcome to(but not required to) eat with the family. I won't have to pack everything into my backpack every second day. 

But I also won't meet as many nice random tourists, and won't get as much free booze. But I'm sure I'll be fine with that. 

It's funny because there is one part of me that REALLY hopes I get this job...and one part that almost hopes I don't...because as hard and annoying as the last little bit has been...it's been amazing. And seriously those little amazing moments are really what it's all about. That's what life is about."

I'm in a room with a group again, they are nice enough, but have no interest in socialising with me. So I feel alone again. And somehow I expected this to happen, because I had awesome roomies last time, so this place has to suck right? Ugh. Terrible theory. Why can't everyplace be good? I'm sure it can...

And I have no idea what to do next...I mean I'm almost to Bris...but there are places I could stop before I get there still...or not? I really don't know. 

Maybe I'm just in a woe is me mood today...which is kind weird because I had a good day, went out for the morning, got groceries, further explored Noosa Heads, came back to the hostel for lunch and listened to the Habs kick ass, found out the Avs are now 5-0 on the season. But in a way that made me sad...not being able to watch the games...or taunt or be taunted by people watching them with me. Everything is text now...never verbal...

I'm really tired...not that I've done much...lots of reading, a bit of walking, meant to go to the beach, but I didn't make it...tomorrow? I have been having weird dreams the last couple nights, so maybe that's the problem...I don't know. It's so hot here...and than so cold at night. Or seems cold anyway.

Not that I would want to travel that way full time...but for a few days at a time it's damn nice. They fed me, drove me, and entertained me. All I had to do was go along for the ride. It was pretty sweet. 

And busy...but in a hurry up and relax kind of way. So we were up early, on the road, running from one part of Fraser Island so another, only to arrive and lay on a beach for an hour. Hop back on the bus, more hurry hurry driving, and than another beach where we could lay and relax. It was prett awesome. The food was amazing(probably the best I've eaten since I got here honestly), the people were pretty cool, and dude...I got to hang with Canadians! Granted they were from Toronto/Ontario, but still it was pretty awesome. Oh and one guy was from Calgary...but ya. Pretty awesome.

I took a tonne of pics, and at the risk of boring you all to death I promise not to post them all. I got to swim in multiple fresh water lakes, as well as salt water pools, and the ocean. I climbed dunes(and ran down them) and rock formations. I sat on a bus wearing a seatbelt that was really and truly nessisary. And I just relaxed and enjoyed three days of not having to think...

Than I called Queensland Rail...

Than I freaked out, panicked, realised that this could easily be dealt with, and figured it out.

But not until after I cried a little.

Yup, that's what happened to me today.

Plans changed, and that's not a bad thing. I'm in Airlie beach again tonight, I was supposed to be on the train. But I found a place to stay that is clean and quiet and cheap. In a couple hours I am going to call Queensland Rail again, and hopefully this time they will not turn my plans on their head again. And tomorrow afternoon I will board a train for Maryborough, and at 5am I will get off said train and transfer to a bus to Hervey Bay. In theory I will be arriving around 7 am (on thursday) at my hostel, but they are expecting me. So even if I just have somewhere to dump my luggage until check in that will be fine. Friday is whale watching in the morning, Saturday I depart for Fraser Island. Nothing else changes. I get one less day in Hervey Bay and one more day on Airlie Beach. No big deal. 

Of course this is the 'in hindsight' portion of the day...as mentioned before when I first found out there were tears and freaking. But you know what? That is part of travelling. Plans change. Maybe there is a reason I'm still here. Maybe it's just to realise that Airlie Beach is actually a nice place. With nice people. And not the hell hole I initially viewed it as. Maybe there is something more...I don't know. But I'll find out...in time.

All in all I think I dealt with this pretty well. And I am once again relaxed and enjoying myself. So it's all good right?


<b>Edit: I have since talked to Queensland Rail and nailed down my travel plans. I do leave on the Tilt Train today, and they waved the 'upgrade fee' for me. The guy I talked to apologised for everything that happened and(after playing the hold game, which is not nearly as exciting as it sounds) got everything booked for me!"

"event","So...the last few posts have been rather blah...and I kind of feel bad, because all in all I am having an amazing time here. I just seem to prefer to rant about the bad things more than talk about the good things.

Good things so far:

Amazing friends made at Cape Trib, the bus ride was a bit, ugh, but through that I met some cool people. We went for long walks along the beach(to a boooring...no wait not so boooring lookout). During which we avoided water(it makes things wet) and mostly just laughed at Christof(the German I was quoting in the parentheses)

Random people on the train. These are great for a few reasons. I have heard some of the most amazing far fetched stories, discussed books(and the fact that that shows/movies are NEVER as good), and been lectured time and time again about the various dangers that Australia has to offer. Makes me laugh that people seem to think tourists are oblivious to the many many dangers this lovely country has to offer.

Townsville was beautiful. Which I didn't say before. Sure it was run down, but the aquarium was absolutely amazing, and the museum was pretty epic as well(they had a Dalek, that alone was worth the ten bucks to get in). The beaches were pretty, the people were pretty cool, and climbing the 'mountain' was pretty awesome.

Magnetic Island was AMAZING. I swam in a secluded bay, met another group of awesome people, got a birthday drink from a random Northern Irishman, who lived in Vancouver before he started travelling and may or may not know my cousin Evan from working in Earls in Vancouver(ya that tripped me out, he totally described Evan). And a very drunk(but very nice) British guy with the weirdest accent I have heard yet. Went for dinner with an American and a German(and I really really need to learn more people's name and not just their countries)' where one of the girls got attacked by a kookaburra who stole some of her fish, and watched the sun set on the beach. Ran into one of the lady's I met in Cairns, wandered down to the beach to stargaze, and holy hell could I see a LOT of stars! That looked so different from back home, and so cool! 

Airlie Beach, I could complain so much, haven't slept worth shit and my roomies are creepy as hell, but the town itself is pretty awesome. Beautiful beaches and marina. Not quite white sand, but getting closer, and the water is SO blue and beautiful. 

Tomorrow I head to the Barefoot Lodge on Long Island,and I am SO stoked for that! Couple days of swim up bars and 'resort' living...though I am still in dorm living, only a 4 share there though, so smaller room, and therefore more privacy. Should be good. I have to be on the bus around 8am tomorrow, or possibly 10...there are a few ferries I can catch, every couple hours, but I think I want to try and go earlier than later, more time to enjoy the island, and less time with my crazy roomies here. 

I'm stressing out a little. Everything here is expensive, so I feel like I'm going through my money too fast, I'm not broke yet, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time...I need to be better with my spending, and the closer I get to a zero balance I'm sure the better I will get.

I'm also stressing about doing 'everything' because I know but physically and financially I can't. And it makes me a little sad, but at the same time I feel I am doing lots and really enjoying what I am doing, so that's what's important right?"

This is not the case today...ended up in a room full of Germans, which isn't weird there are a tonne of them around, and usually they are pretty fine, but this group all seem to know each other, and be friends, and act as though I'm an inconvenience. Every time I walk in the door some of them are there and they either glare at me or else just turn to each other and speak German.  It sucks. I feel beyond left out. It's annoying. And kinda pisses me off. 

This is the frost time I have REALLY had this problem, and I suppose it shouldn't be surprising, I mean odds are if people are travelling together they will do things together, but the fact that the hostel put me in this room with 7 people who are obviously a group seems dumb. 

Ugh. It sucks because I had SUCH a good time on Magnetic, and in a few other places where I have met and bonded with people, made friends and had fun. And this is just...grr.

I planned as far as Thursday before...but now Thursday is getting close, and I don't have a plan. I have a vague idea...but no plan. Bah! 

The hardest part of planning is budgeting...and that sucks ass, but is important! Or so I keep telling myself...I suck at sticking to a budget. But I suppose I'm going to have to figure it out...or else live on the streets...lol.

I am pretty sure that after 'Maggie' I am heading to Airlie, than...well I think that's where the problem lies for me. There are places I want to go, but they are not included on my rail pass, so they will cost extra to get to...and I really don't want to have to spend more money on transportation, I already spent enough...but at the same time...I really want to go...bah! Maybe I'll just have to pick one or two 'biggies' and make do? So much for doing 'everything!'. 

The last few days have been very up and down for me. Lots happening, nothing really bad, just a lot going on. Exhausting me in ways I never thought I would be effected. Plus the heat is exhausting. So that doesn't help. 

I'll be honest. I'm not a big fan of Townsville, the town feels very run down, and rather empty(though there were a tonne of people on Castle hill today), maybe everyone just headed to the suburbs? The hostel I'm staying at is very...well institutional. Not the staff, the staff is good, but the walls are peach, and the doors are those sliding ones that look like they should have bared windows in them. The whole place is echoey and sound carries way too easily. So it seems really loud and quiet all at the same time. Plus the free wifi that they bragged about in the ads only works in one small room, and even then it's not a hundred percent...

I'm really hoping Magnetic Island is amazing...because really that's the only reason I stopped in Townsville..."

"event","So...I'm just chilling here in an ancient rainforest...it's pretty cool. Actually no, it's hot! Really hot! Not at the moment as its now evening, and therefore cooling off, but in the sun, yup still hot!

It's beautiful here. Not a whole lot to do, but beautiful. Took a little hike today, along the beach to a lookout, it was pretty nice. Than walked up to the nearest little shop, picked up some ice cream and a drink than headed home. And that was about the highlight of my day.

The last few days I have been by and far more social. Made a few friends, met some interesting characters. Shared some wine and laughs with people. 

The last week and a bit has been interesting for sure. 

I'm really starting to miss certain people, and that's hard. 

It's hard sometimes to be alone, even when you aren't really...and that's the hard part. I feel alone sometimes even when I'm with other people. But at the same time there are some absolutely amazing times to be had with people, and friends to be made...right?

Tomorrow I'm off again, heading to Cairns for the night and than off to Townsville for my birthday. It's sad to think I'll be alone for my birthday...but again I knew this was coming so it shouldn't be a shock to me...

This is rather disjointed and I'm sorry, I just felt I should write something...but wasn't sure where it was going when I started, apparently the answer is no where."

"event","To anyone who thinks it might be fun to live on a train for a few days allow me to impart some wisdom on you...

1. Bring snacks! Sure they have food on the train, good food in fact, but there is no way of being sure the hospitality services will be open when your snack attack hits.

2. Books! I managed to read three in two days on the train, and got part way into a third...sure the scenery is awesome and exciting, but there comes times when trees and mountains become a little dull, and escaping into a book is a good solution to boredom.

3. Talk to people! Trust me half the people on the train are just as bored as you, and will be more than happy to exchange stories with you. 

4. Sleep! It's hard I know. The seats aren't very comfortable and there are people moving around, you stop and start...but trust me, if you don't sleep and become a cranky monster no one on the train will like that.

That's all I got. 

I for one mostly enjoyed my time on the train, was I happy to get off? Hell yes I was, but that won't stop me from planning my next big long crazy train trip(honestly I already have the passes!) 

Also keep in mind that after 30 hours on a train you may accidentally befriend children who want to take you home with them...oops!"

"event","Well here I am. I(finally) made it to Australia.

First things first, you know the joke about how most airports are disturbingly similer? Well got on the plane at LAX looking at HSBC adverts, got off the plane 15 hours later in Sydney to the SAME ADVERTS! Freaking creepy!

Next made it though customs, which involved a whole lot of standing around me wondering why we couldn't have used some of those 15 hours on the plane to explain where we were going, for how long and why...I mean really? /end rant

Got clear of everything and met up with the amazing and wonderful Kirsty! Who brough me into town, showed to me to my hostel, and then we went on an adventure to Wooloomooloo(fun word to type!) and had lunch, sat and chilled and than she headed home and I brilliently decided to get a padlock for my locker at the hostel, only to get myself compleatly lost and than unlost and checked in a little late. Setteled in a bit, went to find a starbucks and some wifi, accomplished both of those, got waylayed by a nice gentleman who works with Greenpeace(he was VERY excited I was Canadian and asked if I have ever been to California). Wandered back to the hostel, read and chilled and passed out around 8, woke up and 3, went back to sleep and got up around 7:30.

Today so far I have wandered down to see the Opera house(complete with construction fences) and looked at the bridge. After this I am planning to go for a walk and find some lunch, and hopefully a camera too. 

I love that I have finally made it to this wonderful country, and look forward to all the adventures that are going to happen here!"

"event","Got a few more things to cross off on my list...only a few things left, like booking my tickets from Sydney to Cairns, and buying my camera and a journal. Oh and I really need to find more shorts...because something tells me I am going to need more than the three pairs I own(especially since two of those are technically swim shorts). And speaking of...maybe a real swimsuit...maybe...big maybe...ugh I hate swimsuit shopping. 

Anyway got my YHA card today(well ordered it really, it should be arriving within the week) and got my 'sleeping bag' and by sleeping bag I mean silk sleeping bag liner that I will be using as a sleeping bag because I doubt I will be needing a real sleeping bag...at least from what I've heard. I will have a blanket with me as well, just in case I do get cold.

I started repacking the things that I am planning to store, it's somehow easier and yet harder than I expected...I guess it'll get tougher as I go, or maybe easier? I really have no idea. I plan to get pretty much everything down to a few bins that I'm going to store at my parents, aside from the stuff that is going to other peoples houses(like the TV, couch, etc), and the books that people have so kindly offered to borrow while I'm gone. 

I have been talking to Kirsty a bit and am super stoked that she is willing to meet me at the airport and give me a nickle tour of Sydney for my first day! It's been a very long time that her and I have been discussing me visiting, so the idea of finally meeting her is VERY exciting! Also a friend of my dad's put me in contact with a girl who visited their family a few years ago and is living in Cairns, so that makes another person who can give me a more local perspective. Knowing there are people there who I know, or semi know, or know people I know, makes me feel a whole lot better about this. Because it proves I won't be alone...and that was my biggest fear(and probably one of my most foolish ones). 

Now back to packing...so much to do...and deadlines are approaching!"

"event","Seriously?

I mean I know I'm not, but when did I reach the point where people viewed me as old? Is 28 old? I didn't think so. Hell most of the time I have a hard time remembering that I am that old...but I am. Technically anyway. 

Most of the jobs I have been looking at in Australia are aimed at 'younger' people...and by younger I mean they are listed for '18-27 year olds' so I am 28...one year off of that age range, but that magically makes me 'too old'. I don't get it. Is that one year going to magically make me incapable of keeping up with a two year old? I don't think so. Am I supposed to magically become a bitter old croon because I made it this far without having a family of my own? I really don't get it. 

Can I cry ageism here? 

Does that even exist when you are my age? Or am I too young for that? Or by suggesting I am too young to accuse people of ageism am I making myself old? Or does this rant prove that I am a bitter old croon who is upset by her lack of kids/cats?

Or am I just really tired and getting worked up over nothing?

And does anyone actually read what I write here? Or should I give up on the whole blogging concept because no one cares? And by saying that am I just fishing for attention like the immature 28 year old I am?"

"event","OMFG, it's EARLY and I'm still awake.  Why can't I sleep?  Feels like I havn't had a good night sleep in SOOOOOO long.  Almost a year now actually.  Too many thoughts I guess.  O-well.  Only one thing to do about it.  NOTHING.  There's nothing I can do.  Every time I try doing something, it goes straight to hell.  But, enough of the sob story.  SMILE WORLD, YOU SUCK!!!"

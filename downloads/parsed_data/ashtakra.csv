But Stacy was just a kid and would learn as Kurt had that you had to take the good with the bad; in fact you needed them to know the difference.</p><p>Minding Sam's siblings had become almost a fortnightly event, one which he wasn't sure who looked forward to it more, him or them. &quot;You know Stace,&quot; he said, closing the book. &quot;I don't feel like reading today, how about a movie?&quot;</p><p>She clapped her hands and went to pick a DVD and came up clutching one as if it were the ring of power.</p><p>He glanced at the cover. &quot;Perfect,&quot; he sighed, wondering how she had known to pick that exact movie. As the opening intro of Aladdin played he let her climb into his lap and hugging her close he lost himself in his own memories as Stacy was lost to the wonder of Disney.</p><p><u>Kurt Remembers</u></p><p>'<i>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times'</i></p><p>The trip to the store was no trouble, although the roads were a little wet but as he glanced up there was no rain coming down any more. The weather app had said a cold front was moving in but Kurt figured he had time before it hit. Unfortunately a twenty minute wait at the shop, caused by an employee who thought her smoke break was more important than customer service, meant the cold front hit first. His clue was a gust of freezing air that almost tore the package out of his grip &ndash; he'd put too much time in to lose the pie however and almost dislocated a shoulder keeping the box upright. Once the box was secured on the back Kurt started the bike and carefully took off.</p><p>The shop assistant should have pissed him off and the weather would normally have him miserable but Kurt could not help but feel great. Life was good if having a boyfriend, a healthy Dad and sort-of full family was anything to go by. His marks were good, not top of the class like he would be at McKinley, but a B at Dalton was held in better stead than an A+ at McKinley. Sure he missed being in New Directions and seeing his friends everyday but he had to see the school year out before at least considering a return.</p><p>Half way home another gust made him run over the gutter and Kurt's father appeared in a bubble, saying to get off the pocket rocket and walk!</p><p>He figured his Dad would never say pocket rocket but Kurt was nothing if not a dutiful son.</p><p>The wind really picked up and he had to zip his collar up and left the helmet on with the visor lifted since he had no hat with him. It was a poorly lit part of Lima but Kurt knew the roads and the sparsely spaced streetlamps kept him on the footpath.</p><p>It was almost half-an-hour later that he smelt something on the air, a smell he recognised from years working in his father's shop &ndash; burnt rubber and smoking oil. He trotted along with the bike, a sickening feeling building in his guts.</p><p>His worst fears were confirmed when he saw a dark vehicle up against a tree, headlights flickering as the power went on and off; thankfully there was no fire but he would know that truck anywhere.</p><p>&quot;Finn!&quot; he yelled, almost dropping the bike as he rushed to the driver's door. The front was up against the tree, buckled in but not enough to intrude upon the cabin &ndash; thankfully. &quot;Finn!&quot; he yelled again, wrenching the door open and touching his step-brother on the shoulder. Finn flinched awake but looked very confused; he squinted at Kurt for a few seconds.</p><p>&quot;Where's Puck?&quot; they spoke at the same time. Kurt knew he had to look since the passenger seat was empty but he gave Finn a quick check first. The interior light was on and flickering so it was hard to see but there was no obvious blood and he was conscious. Somehow Kurt managed to form coherent thoughts and prioritized what he had to do.</p><p>Thrusting his phone into Finn's hand he told him to call an ambulance, mentally cursing himself for not calling them earlier, then they would not have been out looking for him. At least that's what he figured they were doing. Finn nodded and pressed numbers, bringing the phone up. Kurt waited no longer and left Finn to it.</p><p>&quot;Puck!&quot; he called this time, looking over the bonnet but the area was too dark and nothing showed in the flickering headlights.</p><p>&quot;Puck! Noah!&quot; he almost screamed as he ran around the tree and spotted an arm flung out from the very corner of the truck.</p><p>An arm with a hand that he could see was covered in blood in every flash of light.</p><p>KPKPKPKP</p><p>Stacy giggled in his lap and Kurt noticed that it was the market scene, where Aladdin was being chased by the guards. He smiled too and fondly remembered Puck's rendition in the school cafeteria. Even though it had been brought on by the tumor Puck had done a very good job and the story had soon become a legend to be told to any new students. Of course Puck had become a legend to be talked about on his own with the success of the Rainbow Slushie movement, now global with sister sites in Europe and South America. The fact that Puck was a former bully who had made good and become a champion for the 'losers' only enhanced the very newsworthy and bittersweet story of one Noah Puckerman.</p><p>&quot;You look sad,&quot; said Stacy, staring at him instead of the movie.</p><p>&quot;No I'm not,&quot; answered Kurt. &quot;See, I'm smiling.&quot;</p><p>She shook her head. &quot;Uh uh, that's a Sammy unsmile.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Unsmile?&quot;</p><p>She pointed at Kurt's face. &quot;Sam used to look like that a lot, when we moved to the motel &ndash; he'd say everything was okay and that we'd have lots of fun sharing one room together.&quot; She pouted as only small girls and Rachel Berry could do. &quot;But we knew he didn't mean it&hellip; he was really sad but wouldn't let us know.&quot;</p><p>Thankfully the Evans hadn't been homeless for too long. Sam's Dad had found another job, long hours and not as good money but it made enough for renting a house and Burt had given his Mom a part-time job taking care of the workshop's accounts. She had also got some shift work at the hospital which meant they needed a babysitter sometimes, because Sam had a social life now he had Blaine. Kurt probably would have helped out anyway but the Evans's young kids were such a delight he actually enjoyed hanging out with them.</p><p>&quot;And you called it the Sammy unsmile,&quot; Kurt shook his head at child logic. &quot;Well Stace, I am not unhappy&hellip; just melancholy.&quot;</p><p>She gave him a stink eye. &quot;I don't know what that means.&quot; She sounded just like Sam sometimes.</p><p>&quot;It means I'm a little gloomy,&quot; he pouted himself and she giggled again. &quot;A little down but not upset &ndash; get it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not really,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;But Sam always sings when he gets unsmiley.&quot; She looked at Kurt expectantly. He pretended to be confused until she nudged him.</p><p>&quot;Fine,&quot; he said in diva mode. &quot;What is the lady's request?&quot;</p><p>She looked back at the TV screen and grinned, making Kurt gulp.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Stacy grabbed the remote and flicked through the chapters, finding the one she wanted.</p><p>&quot;Ready?&quot; she almost shouted. &quot;You do the boy part.&quot;</p><p>He frowned, knowing he'd promised himself never to sing this, but she was so excited his refusal crumbled as the first bars started up.</p><p>&quot;<i>I can show you the world<br />Shining, shimmering, splendid<br />Tell me, princess, now when did<br />you last let your heart decide.&quot;<br /></i></p><p>As he sang Kurt felt the memories flood back in again.</p><p><u>Kurt Remembers</u></p><p>&quot;Noah!&quot; he felt like the entire world slowed down as he ran and knelt next to his boyfriend. &quot;Noah,&quot; he said more softly and put a hand to Puck's face, his eyes were closed but Kurt felt breath coming from his lips. He gave a short sigh in relief and checked Puck for injuries. The bloodied hand was a result of a deep laceration on his wrist which Kurt did not hesitate to clamp a hand over. It was hard to see much else given the bad light; it was like trying to read in a lightning storm. The next flash made Kurt gasp as it revealed a dark stain spreading across Puck's abdomen.</p><p><i>[&quot;</i><i><b>I can open your eyes<br />Take you wonder by wonder</b></i><i>&quot;]</i></p><p>&quot;No,&quot; he whispered. &quot;No no no.&quot; He pulled up Puck's shirt and winced at the ugly wound. All he could see was torn skin and black inside. &quot;Finn!&quot; he yelled. &quot;Get over here now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Take off your jacket,&quot; Kurt ordered and bunched it up then pressed it to the wound. Puck groaned as he put pressure on and hoped that was a good sign &ndash; at least he was partially conscious.</p><p>&quot;Oh God,&quot; Finn muttered, putting his hand over Kurt's to help. &quot;This is all my fault.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Accidents happen,&quot; muttered Kurt, not wanting to deal with a Finn guilt spiral right now. &quot;Noah, can you hear me?&quot; he spoke with what he hoped was a strong tone but in his head he was screaming and crying. This could not be happening.</p><p>&quot;Hey princess,&quot; Puck's voice rasped out and a finger touched Kurt's cheek. &quot;You're okay,&quot; Puck continued and sighed happily, his eyes glinting in the low light as he tried to focus on Kurt.</p><p>&quot;I'm just great,&quot; snarked Kurt. &quot;What the hell were you doing?&quot;</p><p>His boyfriend smiled, Kurt couldn't see clearly but it looked like there was blood on his teeth. &quot;Saving you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dude stop talking, save your energy,&quot; said Finn, grimacing as he kept pressing on the jacket.</p><p>&quot;Oh Finessa,&quot; said Puck, his smile almost becoming a laugh. &quot;Don't you get it &ndash; she was showing me <i>my</i> death, not Kurt's.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop it,&quot; hissed Kurt. &quot;No-one's dying today.&quot;</p><p>Puck grabbed his hand and turned serious. &quot;I was sent back to save you&hellip; job done.&quot;</p><p>Kurt wanted to cry as he felt icy cold drops on his back &ndash; it was starting to rain again and wasn't that just perfect?</p><p>&quot;No-one sent you back Noah &ndash; you survived because you had good doctors.&quot;</p><p>Shaking his head groggily Puck talked as his breath got shorter. &quot;No, she sent me back&hellip; for you, the hand in blood, I thought&hellip; but it was me <i>not</i> you.&quot;</p><p>[&quot;<i><b>Over, sideways, and under<br />On a magic carpet ride</b></i><i>&quot;</i>]</p><p>This was ridiculous thought Kurt. Puck would wear himself out with this nonsense but how could he shut him up? There was blood but he couldn't tell how much but probably too much. To be safe they had to keep Puck calm and still, not something he was currently as he wanted to keep talking.</p><p>How could you ever shut Puck up?</p><p>Sex was out.</p><p>Kurt shook his head internally at the inappropriate thought &ndash; he really had been around Noah Puckerman long enough to think like him.</p><p>That's it! He just had to think like him.</p><p>&quot;Noah,&quot; he soothed. &quot;I <i>am</i> safe, you did it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're-safe?&quot; Puck was sounding more confused.</p><p>&quot;But you're not,&quot; Kurt put his cheek against Puck's. &quot;I need you with me Noah, if you go I won't be safe anymore.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Finn-said-time's-up,&quot; Puck said breathlessly.</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; whispered Kurt and kissed Puck on the lips. &quot;Our time is just beginning, maybe you weren't just sent back to save me,&quot; he locked eyes with his boyfriend. &quot;You were sent back so we could save each other.&quot;</p><p>Tears leaked from Puck's eyes and Kurt kissed him again. &quot;You don't want to leave me do you?&quot;</p><p>Puck shook his head, lips trembling.</p><p><i>[&quot;</i><i><b>A whole new world<br />A new fantastic point of view</b></i><i>&quot;]<br /></i></p><p>&quot;Then calm down,&quot; Kurt put his free hand over Puck's heart. &quot;The ambulance will be here soon and I need you to hold on until then.&quot;</p><p>He put his head back into Puck's neck. &quot;Please don't leave me.&quot;</p><p>KPKPKPKP</p><p><i>[&quot;</i><i><b>No one to tell us no<br />Or where to go<br />Or say we're only dreaming</b></i><i>&quot;]</i></p><p>Stacy's eyes were closed so Kurt let the song play without singing the next part; Stacy would have made him sing the female part too but she'd never know.</p><p>A sudden hot breath against his ear let Kurt know they weren't alone and a very male voice sang the Princess' part.</p><p>&quot;<i>A whole new world<br />A dazzling place I never knew.&quot;</i></p><p>Kurt smiled and reached up and behind, not needing to see him to be able to wrap an arm around Puck's head.</p><p>Puck gently put Stevie down next to his sister and brought an arm around Kurt's chest.</p><p>&quot;<i>But when I'm way up here<br />It's crystal clear<br />That now i'm in a whole new world<br />With you&quot;<br /></i></p><p>He took Kurt's hand and brought him around so they were facing each other, Kurt leaning on the back of the couch and Puck kneeling down so they were face to face. Puck was wriggling those adorable bloody eyebrows so Kurt had no choice but to continue the duet.</p><p>&quot;<i><b>Now I'm in a whole new world with you</b></i>.&quot;</p><p>Although Kurt swore singing Disney with his boyfriend would have been height of ridiculousness &ndash; it was kind of hot and definitely sexy for Puck to be singing the girl part.</p><p>&quot;<i>Unbelievable sights<br />Indescribable feeling<br />Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling<br />Through an endless diamond sky&quot;</i></p><p>&quot;A whole new world&quot;</p><p>Puck pecked his lips and gave him that smile that said things would be getting on later.</p><p>Kurt playfully put his hand over Puck's face.</p><p><i>&quot;</i><i><b>Don't you dare close your eyes</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;A hundred thousand things to see&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;</i><i><b>Hold your breath- it gets better</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p>Puck laughed softly at Kurt's own eyebrow wriggle as he sang 'it gets better'.</p><p><i>&quot;I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far I can't go back to where I used to be&quot;</i></p><p>&quot;<i><b>A whole new world</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;Every turn a surprise&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;</i><i><b>With new horizons to pursue</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;Every moment gets better&quot;</i></p><p><i>(together:) &quot;</i><i><u>I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare, let me share this whole new world with you</u></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p>&quot;<i><b>A whole new world</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;A whole new world&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;</i><i><b>That's where we'll be</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;That's where we'll be&quot;</i></p><p>&quot;<i><b>A thrilling chase</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;A wonderous place&quot;</i></p><p><i>&quot;</i><i><u>For you and me</u></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p>Puck stood and pulled Kurt up over the couch to join him. Wrapped in his boyfriend's arms Kurt wanted to giggle like a six year old, then glanced at the sleeping children and thought better of it.</p><p>&quot;You're not meant to be lifting anything heavy,&quot; he whispered.</p><p>Puck chuckled and flexed a bicep. &quot;Nothing the Puckosaur can't handle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Neanderthal,&quot; Kurt muttered with tenderness.</p><p>Shrugging Puck smiled and looked at the children. &quot;I wore him out with Super Mario Cart, works every time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Disney worked for the young lady, obviously,&quot; countered Kurt.</p><p>&quot;Works for me too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Great Gucci, could you be any more naff&hellip; and don't pretend you don't know what that means.&quot;</p><p>Puck hung his head but his grin remained. &quot;I know if I quote poetry you'll forgive me anything.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Almost anything,&quot; argued Kurt and traced a finger over Puck's surgical head scar and then lightly over his abdomen that was still healing. &quot;No more wounds okay.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I promise,&quot; said Puck easily. &quot;because '<i>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height</i><i>; </i><i>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight</i><i>; </i><i>For the ends of Being and ideal Grace'</i>.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Now you're just being cocky,&quot; Kurt replied but knew he was blushing. &quot;I think I really like this Noah who no longer knows what fate has in store for him.&quot;</p><p>Puck pulled him closer, if that was at all possible and brought their noses almost touching. &quot;I know what my future is,&quot; he said huskily.</p><p>Looking into those deep brown eyes, so full of love, Kurt felt as if a weight was finally lifting and put his lips to Pucks.</p><p>It was just as well the children were sleeping.</p><p>The End.</p><p>Author's Note:</p><p><i>Can I just say&hellip; Phew! and then a disappointed sigh &ndash; because its over and this has been so much fun. I am sorry to those whom I worried but it was never my intention to have Puck pass on &ndash; well not permanently. Of course putting him through the wringer &ndash; well a hurt Puck is just so huggable (and damn you Shue for getting that absolutely awesome hug from Puck in the finale). To everyone who has made it thus far, thank you for the feedback, thank you for the praise and much thanks for just indulging my imagination.</i></p><p><i>Cheers, Ash.</i></p></lj-cut><p><br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

Now, Puck and Kurt are together, so are Sam and Blaine but that's another story. The Winter Ball was a big success and they got to dance in front of everyone, mostly due to Finn's great speech and Puck's anti-bullying campaign.

On that note things are falling into place, and even though I wrote it I had to go back and read a few chapters to be sure of what had happened. I suggest re-reading Chapter 11 (the weird one) to get the proper impact from this one. Oh, and smut alert for this chapter too.</b></i></p><p>To the story:</p><p>The worst of winter had passed but it was still colder than he remembered as Puck stood outside the doctor's office waiting to be picked up. He blamed the drugs for thinning his blood and conveniently ignored the fact his mother had told him to wear more layers today; it was easier to blame the medication than his ma. A gust of wind blew chills across his spine but then he wasn't sure it was just the cold. As if to emphasise the point the sun came out and shone right into Puck's eyes. Yep, still cold.</p><p>He hugged his arms close and wondered how long Finn was going to be. Once again its not as if he had given Finn an exact time but Puck's mood was not up for being understanding.</p><p>A motorbike pulled up near him but Puck ignored it in favour of keeping an eye out for Finn's ugly truck. It was only when he felt a glare upon him did Puck take a second look at the rider.</p><p>&quot;Kurt?&quot;</p><p>The helmeted figure nodded and reached behind, unslinging a bag which he threw at Puck's feet. Inside was a riding jacket, similar to Kurt's but in Puck's size and with more black. Wasting no time Puck put it on and grinned at his boyfriend, doing a little spin to Kurt's nodded approval &ndash; it did fit perfectly of course. Kurt had removed his helmet and unclipped another from the other side of the bike, he brought it over in a sexy swagger that had Puck smirking and giving his own nod. Dressed in the leathers, with his top zip undone to show the skin-tight red skivvy beneath, Kurt was one of the hottest things Puck had ever seen... in his unbiased opinion.</p><p>&quot;Guess who got their road licence today,&quot; Kurt said proudly, slipping the helmet over Puck's head and tightening the chin strap. &quot;Course, I shouldn't be taking passengers but Finn mentioned you needed a pick up, so.&quot; He slipped Puck's visor up and kissed him. &quot;Hope you don't mind.&quot; Kurt laughed at Puck's inability to respond and led him by the hand over to the motorcycle. He jabbered on about letters and numbers and horsepower but all Puck really understood was Honda and zero-to-sixty. Kurt, with his helmet back on, sat on the bike and patted the place behind him, not Puck's fault his eyes lingered on Kurt's backside for longer than was necessary. Sliding on behind him, in what he hoped was a smooth move, Puck wrapped his arms around Kurt and tried not to giggle like a four year old when Kurt started the engine. The vibration combined with being pressed against his boyfriend gave Puck an instant hard on, his earlier frustrations forgotten as Kurt patted his clasped hands and gunned the throttle.</p><p>The side streets of Lima whizzed by as Kurt took them from Main Street through to McKinley High, not stopping but just slowing down to the incredulous stares of a hundred students enjoying their lunch on and around the front steps. Puck wasn't sure what Kurt was showing off more, his new transport or his boyfriend, which didn't bother Puck because hello, he <i>was</i> a stud. They moved on to the park where Puck thought they might stop to play some soccer but instead Kurt kept going, through the residential area and then up the small hill that locals affectionately called Mount Lima. Actually Puck was pretty sure it wasn't high enough to be a mountain, but then there was nothing higher in the area. Stopping at the lookout Kurt jumped off the bike, tore off his helmet hollered in excitement, his face flush and grinning.</p><p>&quot;That was fantastic! Do you know how long I've wanted to do that?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since you were a little kid-.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Since I was a little kid &ndash; hey!&quot; Kurt scowled as he realised Puck had spoken at the same time. &quot;Well yes, you know Noah,&quot; Kurt leered. &quot;That jacket looks really good on you.&quot;</p><p>Undoing the front as he got off the bike Puck returned the heated look. &quot;I could say the same... any reason you've brought me to make out point?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really, is that what its called?&quot; said Kurt innocently but removing his own jacket and carefully hanging it on the throttle. &quot;Imagine the coincidence given the thoughts I'm having.&quot;</p><p>Puck looked around and was glad to see they were alone before he grabbed Kurt and pulled him to the ground. He went straight for Kurt's neck, nuzzling and tugging on his ear with teeth, knowing he loved that and it was sure-fire way to get him as hard as Puck was. Groaning Kurt ground into Puck, revealing his ear nibbling had worked and as their erections touched, even with clothing between them, they gasped in pleasure and Puck caught Kurt in a passionate kiss. It had been a few weeks since the Winter Ball and much of their spare time had been spent in moments like this. Puck wasn't complaining since the passion only seemed to escalate the more times they did this. He put that passion into the kiss and felt Kurt respond, his hand moving down to clasp Puck through his jeans and knead the head of his cock. Whispering Kurt's name Puck used his own hand to undo Kurt's belt and pants, slipping in to give Kurt the same treatment. The slickness of Kurt's cock revealed the ride had turned him on too if the pre-come was any indicator; Puck knew his own was already leaking profusely.</p><p>&quot;Need you now,&quot; demanded Kurt, and who was Puck to refuse. He slithered down Kurt's torso, kissing and lightly biting him through the skivvy. In seconds he had pulled down Kurt's pants and underwear and he took a moment to admire Kurt's throbbing prick, glistening in the afternoon sun and surrounded by thick black hair. Kurt might be perfectly coiffed everywhere else but he refused to shave down there &ndash; claiming it was hotter to let it grow... Puck heartily agreed. He enveloped the knob and sucked up the pre-come, swirling his tongue to gather every drop before taking more of Kurt in until his nose was buried in pubes. Kurt moaned his name loudly and thrust up, fingers digging into his shoulders. Bobbing and sucking Puck expertly deep throated his boyfriend, practice really had made perfect. As Kurt's breathing quickened Puck palmed himself then undid his zip to free his own cock, unable to wait he stroked himself while sucking off Kurt. Practice had also taught them about timing and as Kurt thrust again Puck used his free hand to grab Kurt's balls and squeeze them gently, sending Kurt almost to a thrashing point and calling to a deity he didn't believe in. Seconds later Puck was momentarily interrupted as Kurt forced him out of his jacket, his brand new jacket.</p><p>&quot;Always the practical one,&quot; said Puck breathlessly.</p><p>&quot;Not getting that stained on the first day,&quot; huffed Kurt before throwing his head back as Puck used one slicked finger to trace his ass. &quot;Fuck yeah,&quot; hissed Kurt. &quot;Put it in me Puck, put it fucking in me!&quot;</p><p>Puck complied and thought Kurt had made noises before, now he managed to combine several deities with Puck's name and a whole heap of swearing that no-one would ever believe the demure Kurt Hummel could produce. Returning Kurt's cock to his mouth Puck effectively trapped Kurt from being able to move, all he could do was lower onto Puck's finger before thrusting up into his mouth; Puck knew he couldn't last long this way and stroked himself to try and match Kurt's movement. He could go as quick but Kurt was obviously closer to the edge, his exposed skin was glowing with sweat and his thigh muscles straining in ecstasy as he lifted himself and therefore Puck clear off the ground. His breathing hitched and Puck felt that familiar high pitched gasp that always preceded Kurt's orgasm. Kurt didn't disappoint and thrust in smaller but faster motions, knowing Puck would take him all in. &quot;Fuck Noah, fuck fuck fuck!&quot; With that Kurt came, his semen spraying into Puck's eager mouth and his ass clenching onto Puck's finger. Kurt continued thrusting after he was spent and made those little mewing sounds that had Puck falling in love with him all over again. He gently eased Kurt down and slid his finger out, smiling at Kurt's expression of 'I can't believe that just happened'.</p><p>It took Kurt only half a minute to recover and he slapped Puck's hand away from stroking his own member. &quot;My turn,&quot; grinned Kurt and lowered his mouth over Puck's cock. The soft heat sent Puck's vision to white and he had to clench his fists to not grab Kurt's head, for some reason he didn't like it. Already being close it didn't take long for Kurt's ministrations to bring Puck to the edge, and as he yelled Kurt's name, right over it. Kurt returned the favour and swallowed every drop as Puck bucked and thrust, his cock pulsating with his breaths. They lay entwined after it, both their cocks left out and the sweat drying on their bodies as the sun sunk lower. Kurt's breath returned to normal first and he moved up to kiss Puck's lips.</p><p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot; murmured Kurt, his cheek resting against Puck's.</p><p>&quot;Nothing, this is perfect,&quot; he answered, wondering why Kurt would ask that question.</p><p>Kurt hummed an okay as he tucked himself and Puck back in, deftly zipping Puck up without catching anything vital. Standing and pulling Puck up Kurt smiled sadly. &quot;I'll give you a free pass for now Puckerman, but after dinner you tell me everything okay.&quot;</p><p>Puck sighed and nodded. As with much of what Kurt sometimes 'asked' &ndash; it wasn't really a request but an order.</p><p>KPKPKPKPKP</p><p>Moving the salad out of the way Finn grimaced and reached further back into the refrigerator &ndash; he was positive he'd left a slice of pie back here last week. His scowl deepened as he found celery sticks, carrot slices and half an avocado but no pie.</p><p>&quot;Kurt,&quot; he muttered, glaring up towards where Kurt's room now was. The boy would discard anything after a day, preaching about bacteria and cross contamination but honestly, how could week old pie be dangerous? As he exhausted the possibility his precious pie had escaped the OCD of Kurt it was all Finn could do not to march up and give his step-brother a good talking to. Actually impulse control was not one of Finn's strong points so he did just that.</p><p>&quot;Kurt!&quot; he growled, pushing open his door &ndash; but the room was empty. That was odd, Kurt was usually home by now. A noise from the living room answered his question.</p><p>&quot;Kurt,&quot; he said with less ferocity as he spied Kurt on the couch with Puck, watching some fashion show on mute as Kurt was explaining to Puck the benefits of wool clothing over blends. Tragically Finn actually understood some of it having been exposed to Kurt on previous rants. Speaking of rants. &quot;My pie is missing.&quot;</p><p>Two sets of eyes peered at him like he was speaking another language. &quot;Pie &ndash; fridge &ndash; mine... gone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I did not touch your... pie.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I ate it Hudson, like four days ago.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But,&quot; Finn's eyes misted up. &quot;It was my pie.&quot;</p><p>Kurt stood and got real close. &quot;Are you for real?&quot; He felt Finn's forehead and poked him in the side, which made Finn maybe wince more than was necessary. &quot;I think,&quot; explained Kurt, looking back to his boyfriend. &quot;That its Finn's time of the month.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh hah hah,&quot; said Finn flatly as the other two giggled away. &quot;Its really not funny &ndash; all week at school the only thing that got me through was the knowledge that here at home, waiting all patient like, was a big slice of apple and cherry pie, with extra thick crust and glazed coating.&quot; His mouth watered at the thought and he had to swallow it down. &quot;Now the question is what are <i>you</i> going to do about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Me?&quot; said Kurt, a hand to his own chest. &quot;Why me, he ate it,&quot; he pointed at Puck.</p><p>&quot;The partner rule,&quot; said Finn smugly.</p><p>&quot;The partner rule!&quot; Kurt crossed his arms. &quot;I made that up, there's no such thing,&quot; he said primly.</p><p>&quot;Is so,&quot; shot back Finn. &quot;You said anything my girlfriend's do in this house I am responsible for &ndash; you called it the partner rule and even wrote it on the whiteboard.&quot;</p><p>Kurt huffed loudly. &quot;That was because I was sure Quinn was stealing my moisturiser &ndash; it costs $80 an ounce you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pie's only five bucks for the whole lot &ndash; so you're getting off easy.&quot; For some reason that made Puck laugh dirtily and Finn tried to ignore it &ndash; some things don't change.</p><p>Kurt was still glaring but suddenly looked much more thoughtful. &quot;This isn't just about some left over crust.&quot; He spun and pointed a finger at Puck who halted his second dirty laugh half-way through.</p><p>Wow thought Finn, talk about being whipped.</p><p>Kurt's eyes narrowed as he faced Finn again, then he did a 'OMG' face and gasped. &quot;Quinn dumped you didn't she?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; snapped Finn too quickly. &quot;We ended it amicably.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; sighed Puck from the couch. &quot;You were dipping your finger in the fountain of Jew again weren't you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Noah!&quot; Kurt started then bent over in another fit of giggles while muttering about fingers and Jews. Finn so did not want to know about that one.</p><p>Waving his hands in frustration Finn took Kurt's seat next to Puck. &quot;She said I was looking at Rachel during Math, which is impossible because we don't have that class together.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes you do,&quot; said Kurt in confusion as he sat on the armrest.</p><p>&quot;No because we're doing calculus this month, so its not Math anymore is it.&quot; Finn nodded, noticing Kurt giving Puck a weird look &ndash; it was similar to the one Quinn had given him when he tried to tell her the same thing.</p><p>&quot;Well in any case,&quot; stated Kurt, patting his arm. &quot;I am sorry, you and Quinn are good together &ndash; maybe she just needs more time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Finn, frowning.</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cause I <i>was</i> looking at Rachel, she's been looking pretty hot since she dumped the animal sweater look and may have gone up a breast size.&quot;</p><p>Kurt and Puck slapped their foreheads at the same time.</p><p>&quot;So,&quot; continued Finn, bumping Kurt's arm. &quot;About that pie.&quot;</p><p>Kurt looked to the ceiling and rolled his eyes. &quot;Fine, where do I get it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only one place in town,&quot; grinned Finn. &quot;Sally's Diner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!&quot; exploded Kurt. &quot;That's the exact opposite side of town.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup.&quot;</p><p>They had a staring match but Kurt looked away first. &quot;I guess a ride is something I need after... no Puck &ndash; you stay.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But-.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't you have things to discuss with Finn.&quot;</p><p>This time Finn watched Kurt and Puck have the staring match, and it was Puck who lost &ndash; nodding but smiling when Kurt gave him a kiss on the way out.</p><p>Finn knew Puck though, and he wouldn't want to talk straight away. &quot;Xbox?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Read my mind dude.&quot;</p><p>Forty minutes later Puck threw the controller to the table and folded his arms in defeat. &quot;Now I know you're single &ndash; too much time alone to practice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well not as if I'm going to study.&quot; They both laughed at that. &quot;So,&quot; said Finn, moving closer to Puck. &quot;Spill.&quot; He knew Puck had a doctor's appointment earlier and figured it was connected &ndash; Puck didn't seem unduly unhappy so it had to be good news.</p><p>Licking his lips Puck gave a half smile. &quot;The doc said it was looking good, that,&quot; he gulped and nodded. &quot;It seems I'm in remission.&quot;</p><p>Finn's jaw dropped and he felt his eyes tear up &ndash; he knew what that meant since he'd read up on the stuff since Puck had been sick. &quot;Dude, that's fantastic!&quot; He hugged his best friend and did a little happy dance inside, then stood and dragged Puck up, doing a happy dance for real. &quot;So that means you're all good... its over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Puck, still laughing from Finn's little dance. &quot;I mean I'll need regular check ups and there's still some side-effects of the drugs but... yeah.&quot; He grinned, a real and Finn could tell, open grin that Puck was showing more often these days.&quot;</p><p>Finn hugged him again. &quot;This is awesome, I bet Kurt is ecstatic.&quot;</p><p>Puck nodded. &quot;I had him worried, I found out earlier then freaked about telling him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p>Looking embarrassed Puck shrugged. &quot;I was kind of worried that once I was all better Kurt might not want me anymore.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dude that's insane, he is so much in love with you it is nauseating,&quot; Finn winced at his words. &quot;You know what I mean.&quot;</p><p>Puck laughed. &quot;It was a little stupid and he told me so, speaking of which where is he?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Finn and looked at his watch. &quot;Its not that far, his time's up.&quot;</p><p>Puck's face snapped towards him and his colour drained to a sickly white. &quot;What did you say?&quot;</p><p>Finn wondered what he'd done to make Puck react so badly. He looked at his watch again.</p><p>&quot;I said time's up.&quot;</p><p>To be concluded...</p></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><br />"

Kurt would have joined him too but Mercedes grabbed him and refused to let go and after her Quinn, Santana and even Blaine left Sam's side long enough for a quick groove to some horrid eighties number Kurt felt sure he would never listen to let alone dance. Somewhere along the way the hate group had disappeared, whether from shouting themselves hoarse and being drowned out or by threats of removal Kurt didn't care. He was unsure too how to handle the guys who had actually stood up to the group. Just because they didn't want the hate group here did not mean they would be friendly to Kurt now. Perhaps only time would tell.</p><p>&quot;Zoning out on me again&quot; Quinn whispered in his ear. When had she replaced Sam? Kurt was sure he should have noticed.</p><p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; he spoke over the music. &quot;Just pondering how tonight was full of surprises.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Karofsky a great dancer being one of them,&quot; laughed Quinn.</p><p>&quot;I am sure that is something I will never have to find out,&quot; muttered Kurt darkly.</p><p>Quinn grinned and took the lead as the music changed. &quot;He was very smooth and quite the gentleman, Finn had better watch out because a man who can move like that&hellip; phew,&quot; she fanned herself with a free hand.</p><p>&quot;Careful,&quot; smirked Kurt. &quot;Excepting Finn you have a record of boyfriends who end up finding their own boyfriends.&quot;</p><p>They looked at each other, the laughter on both their lips before Quinn broke first while speaking, &quot;And the jury's still out on him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh honey,&quot; Kurt shook his head. &quot;The boy can sing but no-one who dances so badly has a queer bone in his body.&quot;</p><p>Quinn smiled at Kurt reaffirming Finn's heterosexuality. &quot;Still, it was a good thing he did &ndash; supporting you and Puck and getting the students to accept zero tolerance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was,&quot; agreed Kurt. &quot;He's become quite the leader, you're truly the power couple once again.&quot;</p><p>Her eyes flicking to where Puck sat chatting with Sam and Blaine Quinn shrugged. &quot;We may have some competition.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No danger there,&quot; stated Kurt primly. &quot;Blaine doesn't go to McKinley.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wasn't talking about them,&quot; she said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>&quot;Us?&quot; Kurt faulted on a swing step and laughed. &quot;I'm not at McKinley either remember?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well not for now,&quot; smirked Quinn. &quot;But that could change&hellip; Puck's very persuasive you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know,&quot; Kurt smiled at his boyfriend who sensed it and gave a toothy grin back his way. &quot;But for now you're safe Ms Fabrey &ndash; the money Dad and Carol put in for tuition they'd kill me if I transferred back.&quot;</p><p>After Quinn Kurt finally managed to leave the dance floor and made his way to Puck. He was still smiling and talking with Tina but Kurt could tell Puck was reaching his limit by the weariness in his eyes. To be sure Kurt wanted this night to continue but was not sure it could get any better. Puck had come out to the whole school and also proclaimed his love to Kurt. If he could get Puck home with enough energy left to fool around then it would be perfect. Kurt leered at the thought and refused to feel guilty, he was a teenage boy after all.</p><p>&quot;I know that look,&quot; said Puck huskily. &quot;Are we going to the nearest janitor's closet?&quot;</p><p>Kurt blushed since it has been said in front of company, although it was a good thing Puck could suggest having sex with a guy in front of others.</p><p>&quot;Easy tiger,&quot; he muttered, trying to hide his momentary embarrassment. &quot;I may have other offers to field.&quot;</p><p>Puck's eyes narrowed and he surveyed the people around them. &quot;No-one would dare,&quot; he growled, then smiled. &quot;But it would confirm I've hooked the hottest boyfriend.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I have the most narcissistic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You love me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Actually,&quot; Kurt sat next to him and leant in to his ear. &quot;I really do.&quot; It was almost unnoticeable but Puck shivered and Kurt felt the warmth within him at making Puck feel that way. Sure, it may have been obvious but just as Puck telling him it was important for Kurt to return the favour. They were in love, but it was nice to let each other know it. Waiting until Puck had seemed to recover a little Kurt pulled him back up for some more dancing &ndash; it was what they were here for after all.</p><p>There were two top 50s but then a few slower golden oldies and Kurt moved closer, melding his body with Puck's. He knew that his boyfriend did like to be called Noah sometimes but in his head he had reconciled Noah and Puck as the same person. As they moved around the floor Kurt took no notice of the couples around them and concentrated on the feel and texture of Puck's body. The returning musculature was evident, his upper body especially and he could detect his abdomen doing a lot of the work as they twirled and twisted around. His strong hand held Kurt in the small of his back and his thumb traced lazy circles, sending goose-bumps up Kurt's spine. Their heads were together so Kurt could rub his cheek against Pucks and enjoy the abrasiveness of his boyfriend's slight stubble. There were no words exchanged, they didn't need to as they communicated through touch and gentle sighs. Maybe Kurt had always pictured his perfect partner being taller than himself and engulfing him with his body but now Kurt saw that as the silly and yes, girlish fantasy, that it was. He and Puck were of a height, while slightly broader Puck was no larger than Kurt especially since Kurt had his own dancer muscles to match Puck's gym built ones. They were equals and Kurt saw this as the perfection it was meant to be. He hummed along to the music contentedly and gently kissed Puck's ear, holding his boyfriend as close as he was being held and wishing tonight would never end.</p><p>They couldn't do it forever though, especially Puck, and they made their way to the food tables and sat nearby once they'd loaded up. The comfortable silence between them continued but Kurt knew that the simple touch of Puck's knee against his own was better than conversation at this point. His earlier tension at being the couple 'on show' had already dissipated but he was sure more people than would normally came to say hello and compliment them on their dancing. It was unerringly courteous and Kurt thought this was what it must feel to be in the twilight zone. The majority of people here were McKinley students and yet the harassment was non-existent. Could the Rainbow Slushie website and Finn's speech really have changed things in such a short time?</p><p>Kurt certainly hoped that was the case as he leaned into his boyfriend and finished off his frosted cake. Maybe if this continued he really could consider a return to McKinley. He smiled as he saw Blaine dancing with Sam, not as close as he'd danced with Puck but then they were on their first date &ndash; Sam was obviously doing all the talking and Blaine was politely laughing. They may last, or not &ndash; but at least they were giving it a shot. It was also great to see Santana and Brittany slow dancing, poor Artie thought Kurt, but then he probably already knew &ndash; he was quite smart.</p><p>For just a moment the entire scene seemed to slow down, even the light shimmered more slowly and through a break in the crowd Kurt spotted a lady dressed in the purest white. His heart thumped loudly in his chest and he gasped as his eyes met ones similar to his own, above lips he had also inherited. She waved and smiled at him, tears in her eyes, then everything returned to normal and she was gone. For the first time in his life he felt okay that she was gone.</p><p>&quot;Did you see her?&quot; whispered Puck reverently.</p><p>Kurt could only nod as he clutched Puck's hand a little too tightly. He knew that he would not see her again.</p><p>His mother's work was done.</p><p>KPKPKPKPKPKPKP</p><p>As the last song played Kurt searched for wherever Blaine had gone, since he was their ride and was staying over in any case.</p><p>&quot;They're meeting us outside,&quot; supplied Puck, obviously knowing Kurt's thoughts.</p><p>&quot;They?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Apparently the blonde boy wonder is joining us&hellip; not surprising really.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I hope he doesn't expect us to stay up and watch the SyFy channel.&quot;</p><p>Puck stood and wrapped an arm around Kurt, sneaking a quick kiss. &quot;Nah, I think they have plans to get to know each other better.&quot;</p><p>Kurt gasped in feigned shock. &quot;Not if their sharing my bedroom space they're not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Such a prude,&quot; chuckled Puck, pulling Kurt towards the doors.</p><p>Outside the winter chill hit quickly and Kurt snuggled close to Puck as they tried to find Sam and Blaine. Since his face was pressed into Puck's neck Kurt saw no trouble but felt it when his boyfriend's muscles tensed and he stopped walking.</p><p>&quot;What is-.&quot; His question was cut short as Kurt saw the people standing before them. They were unfamiliar but their silence and stance were menacing. Without a word Puck moved in front to shield Kurt and he stared down the group. Knowing they would stand a better chance as a united front Kurt moved to beside Puck, puffing himself up and giving his best icy stare. He knew Puck wasn't happy about it but he had to understand that Kurt did not always need to be protected. Whatever they did seemed to be enough and the group walked off as if nothing had happened. He let out a breath and heard Puck do the same.</p><p>&quot;We can't change the whole world overnight you know,&quot; Kurt said as he saw how frustrated Puck looked.</p><p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Puck muttered. &quot;Just spoils the night you know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; Kurt bumped Puck's shoulder. &quot;It doesn't because we won't let it. Let's find Blaine and go home&hellip; and have a drink,&quot; he laughed at Puck's incredulous expression. &quot;Since no-one spiked the punch we'll have to raid Dad's liquor cabinet.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey guys!&quot; yelled Sam, joining them with Blaine on his arm. &quot;S' up, are we going or what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yep,&quot; answered Puck, grinning from ear to ear. &quot;Kurt has it all planned out.&quot;</p><p>KPKPKPKPKP</p><p>The whiskey burned but in a good way as Kurt finished off a third shot. Puck did the same and scowled. &quot;There was no mention of having the house to ourselves earlier.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Was a surprise,&quot; Kurt slurred just a little bit. &quot;Didn't want you sweeping us out of there the moment you knew.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pffft, I would have waited at least three songs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Two?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You would never've left the limo,&quot; suggested Sam, somehow two more shots ahead and little sign of drunkenness. &quot;You'd have Kurt back here and pressed into the mattress while we were still walking up the stairs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well&hellip; yes.&quot; Instead of sounding ashamed Puck's voice was full of pride that it was indeed what he would have done.</p><p>&quot;Hic!&quot;</p><p>Kurt laughed at Blaine's only comment and patted the guy's curly haired head. Kurt may be a light-weight but Blaine was a super light-weight &ndash; two shots and he was staring at them cross eyed. It was a fair bet the Dalton boys did not get the chance to drink&hellip; probably ever. Pity for Sam if he was expecting any action but Kurt suspected between Sam's gentlemanly ways and Blaine's inexperience there was not ever going to be more than kissing between them tonight. Probably the same for himself and Puck if they kept drinking.</p><p>They were sitting on the floor around the coffee table with a bottle of Jamesons Irish whiskey almost finished in the middle, half eaten snacks and a card game long forgotten. Kurt had already texted his Dad to say they were home, not risking a phone conversation in case Burt gave him some safe sex advice. Quite apart form the fact Kurt was not going to have sex with Puck tonight it was still weird to have his father not only okay with such things but seeming to encourage it by taking Carol away to a motel for the night. With Finn having gone somewhere with Quinn they really did have the house to themselves and could go to separate rooms if the two couples wanted. Blaine <i>had</i> offered to stay elsewhere but that was impossible now anyway due to his huge binge of two shots.</p><p>Mostly they were just rehashing the night's activities and getting a little drunk. Not exactly party animals but they didn't feel the need. A rumble announced an approaching storm and Kurt considered if they had candles ready, then realized he didn't care since he was wedged between Puck's legs with owner of said legs nibbling on his ear when he wasn't kissing the back of his neck.</p><p>&quot;So was I imagining it or did Karofsky dance with Quinn?&quot; Sam asked, pouring himself another shot and slamming it back without hesitation.</p><p>&quot;Yup&hellip; Queen Quinny was with the fat man,&quot; Blaine slurred and Kurt couldn't decide what was more amusing, his drunkenness or his words.</p><p>&quot;I <i>have</i> already warned her given her past suitors,&quot; put in Kurt, softly nudging Puck behind him and flashing a toothy grin at Sam, who just poked his tongue and reached for the bottle again.</p><p>At least this time he poured three shots, finishing off the bottle and evidently not providing one for Blaine, who seemed past noticing. Puck reached for his and gave Kurt a mouthful of bicep, definitely on purpose.</p><p>&quot;Maybe Quinn will stick it out with Finn this time,&quot; suggested Puck, his motions indicated to Kurt that he took the shot after saying this.</p><p>Kurt waited exactly three seconds before joining Sam in a fit of laughter.</p><p>PKPKPK</p><p>The vodka was pulled out next just as the storm hit. As he had predicted the power went out but they soon had a few tea candles out and continued their talk and drink. Blaine managed one more shot but after that his head hit the table, so they moved him on to his side and let his soft cat-like snores echo around the room. A blanket completed the cute factor and Kurt was pleased to notice that Sam changed positions so he could keep an eye on his date. Obviously Sam wanted to keep drinking but he wasn't giving up on Blaine entirely.</p><p>&quot;To the Rainbow Slushie,&quot; announced Sam, clinking their glasses. &quot;May we never know it anymore except in cyberspace.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cheers,&quot; both Kurt and Puck said, downing their drinks in unison. The vodka might go down easier thought Kurt, but the whiskey smelt better and left a pleasant after-taste.</p><p>&quot;To Sam&quot;, announced Puck, deftly preparing another round from behind Kurt. &quot;For staring those bastards down.&quot; He saluted Sam and this time they all sipped instead of taking the whole amount. &quot;It can't have been easy dude, I respect that.&quot;</p><p>Sam blushed and ran a hand over his stitches, Kurt had noticed him do that a lot and Sam probably didn't even realize he <i>was</i> doing it.</p><p>&quot;It was kind of scary,&quot; he dropped his eyes. &quot;I couldn't even go to the bathroom alone, I tagged along with Finn who probably thought I was hitting on him.&quot;</p><p>Kurt patted his arm. &quot;Maybe now the students have agreed to stop the bullying Figgins will go after them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah,&quot; Sam shook his head and sighed. &quot;Half of them aren't even students and I just want to forget it happened you know?&quot;</p><p>Thinking about the way he said it Kurt nodded slowly in understanding. &quot;Either way you know we're with you.&quot; He hugged Sam and Puck joined them and they stayed that way for a while. It wasn't sexual, just the comfort of togetherness.</p><p>KPKPKPKP</p><p>In the early hours another thunder storm had come through and woken Kurt. Next to him Puck slept on, his profile illuminated by the flashes of lightning. As Kurt had predicted the alcohol prevented anything beyond some fierce kissing and inept groping. It also left them still half clothed, if boxers and singlets counted as clothing. He breathed deeply, enjoying the smell of the storm mixed with Puck's natural scent. Watching Puck's chest rise and fall in the low light became almost meditational as sleep eluded Kurt. They had the heat on so the sheets had been kicked down long ago and one of Puck's hands absently lay upon Kurt's hip. Tracing a line up his hand and arm to Puck's shoulder Kurt smiled at the smooth texture of his boyfriend's skin and the soft dry warmth he exuded.</p><p>It was hard to believe they had gone from barely friends to close lovers in such a short time. Well it had been months but for much of that Puck had been sick, and maybe thought Kurt, that is what helped. They had got to really know each other, not just jumped into bed and relied just on the physical. He knew that Puck still kept things back, like his ongoing treatment and what the doctors were telling him. Sure, Puck seemed back to almost full health but that didn't mean the cancer was gone &ndash; just that they had it under control. His hand moved down to Puck's stomach. There, under that perfection, the sickness was still within him. Hard to imagine really as his hand was lifted up and down by Puck's steady breaths. It was a bad memory now, how ill Puck had looked and how badly the experimental treatment had affected him. Kurt still saw Finn look at Puck with sadness sometimes, maybe thinking what Kurt did &ndash; if it happened again could he survive another round?</p><p>Snuggling into Puck's side Kurt finally felt his lids growing heavy again. Like Puck was always telling him &ndash; if it happened he'd face it then. They had to enjoy the here and now. His eyes closed but the thought nagged him; he loved Noah Puckerman and fell more in love every day &ndash; but was he setting himself for more heartbreak if the worst happened? Sleep claimed Kurt with his question unanswered.</p><p>Tbc&hellip;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut>"

To the left and using the seats instead of dancing were the bulk of the Glee group, along with their extended family of the IT clubbers, band members and a surprising variety of others, including many athletes obviously not concerned with the risk to their social standing. Directly opposite, on the side where the tables were situated stood the hockey players, their groupies and a few footballers still not comfortable with the truce Schue and Beiste had organised between the groups. They were glaring daggers at the Glee club members and laughing amongst themselves as they made threatening gestures every time a teacher's back was turned.</p><p>Cowards.</p><p>In between these polar opposites were almost the rest of the people, dancing and talking and laughing. They were either unaware of the tension or didn't care and Puck was jealous.</p><p>What he wouldn't give to have been able to walk in here and just dance with Kurt without worrying about anything. He mentally winced as he found himself wishing that they could just be 'normal' and much as he knew in his heart they were perfectly normal there was a lifetime of surviving in this bigoted school social system to overcome.</p><p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Kurt's voice soothed his raging thoughts and his smile told Puck that his boyfriend knew exactly what he was stressing over. &quot;Let's join our friends.&quot; Kurt dragged him by the hand to where Rachel was talking the ear off Brad, who had managed to wear a surprisingly fashionable yellow plaid bow tie and vest ensemble.</p><p>&quot;And if you just spoke up more during rehearsals then I wouldn't have to berate you after performances &ndash; Kurt! Noah!&quot; she almost screamed, interrupting whatever response Brad was about to give, which from his expression may be a good thing. As Rachel gave him a hug Puck saw Brad slip away; he nodded at the pianist in understanding.</p><p>Then she was poking him in the chest. &quot;You-are-late mister, can't you tell we need your bad-boy presence to counter the goon squad over there?&quot;</p><p>He shrugged. &quot;Chill Berry, besides I don't think my badass-ness has the same impact anymore.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Works for me,&quot; grinned Kurt, pecking Rachel on both cheeks.</p><p>&quot;Yes well,&quot; smiled Rachel. &quot;Been there almost did that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You snooze, you lose,&quot; laughed Kurt and his happiness was contagious. They'd been through so much in such a short time and at times Puck felt guilty for dragging Kurt down into such miserable territory but to see him shine like this made it all worthwhile. He didn't even think about it and grabbed his boyfriend, dipping him and kissing him ferociously. Kurt only squeaked an initial protest before joining the program. The noise around them faded from Puck's awareness and it was only him and Kurt; their breathing and very heartbeats seemed to match. The feel of Kurt's lips on his was magical, electric just like all those stories said it should be. Only minutes ago Puck had told Kurt he loved him, now he was showing him and he knew they both felt it.</p><p>He pulled back but kept their faces close as they returned to a standing position. In his periphery Puck could tell their performance had certainly gained attention. He laughed and pecked Kurt's lips for good measure. &quot;Just so no-one's left in any doubt about us,&quot; he whispered.</p><p>&quot;I don't think there's any danger of that,&quot; Kurt said breathlessly and his cheek's reddened adoringly. &quot;Just so you know I would have been satisfied with a dance.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Puckosaur always exceeds expectations.&quot; That earned him an eye-roll but Kurt said nothing more and linked their arms, with Rachel on the other side he led them to the main group.</p><p>He could not see Finn but Quinn was seated and speaking quietly with Santana and Brit. Mike and Tina were chatting with some of the football players and there were a few people Puck didn't recognise but by their high quality suits and perfect hair Puck guessed Blaine had not come alone from Dalton Academy. Where Blaine was Puck had no idea so he sidled up to Sam who was staring off across the room, his expression grim.</p><p>&quot;Dude what's up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Apparently you can brutally bash a classmate and still attend dances,&quot; muttered Sam, his eyes not leaving whatever people he was looking at. Following his gaze Puck could see a group of hockey players and some guys he wasn't sure even went to school smirking back their way.</p><p>Puck's eye twitched and he knew he was probably squeezing Kurt's hand too hard. &quot;Those pricks make any move and we're all here to protect you.&quot; Sam ducked his head in thanks but did touch his bruised jaw absently. Puck knew the guy was no coward and would face them again if he had to &ndash; but it had to be hard to see the people who had hurt him standing there as if they had nothing to answer for. Purposely moving to block Sam's view of the goon squad Puck waggled his eyebrows. &quot;Shouldn't you be on the look out for someone else?&quot;</p><p>Sam's instant expression change from pouting teen to goofy grinning idiot was almost too cute and Puck had to flick a glance at Kurt, just in case his boyfriend could read his mind and didn't want him thinking of other guys as cute.</p><p>&quot;He went to get us drinks, I was barely in the door before he came and said hello,&quot; Sam's eyes lit up as he spoke and Puck knew those two would be properly together by the end of the night. &quot;I think he was more nervous than me and I was so anxious I called him Brain.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright Pinky,&quot; soothed Kurt, taking Sam's arm and sitting him down. &quot;Just breathe and we can strategize over who leads your first dance.&quot;</p><p>Puck let them go and continued to survey the room. He could tell that many people were looking their way but trying to not make it obvious. Not being a paranoid person Puck wasn't too worried but tried to imagine if it would be like this all the time &ndash; would every day he and Kurt were together be like they were on show? If so could they ever hope to just be themselves? He mentally shrugged &ndash; whatever happened they'd been through worse. Walking over to Mike he asked him if he'd seen where Finn went. Before Mike could answer Puck sensed trouble and spun around, half-a-dozen girls and guys stood in a row before their group. He didn't know any of them even though they seemed to be school age. They didn't say anything to begin with and just stood staring and Puck felt his gut turn over &ndash; this was not going to be good.</p><p>One of them, a girl with long brown hair that seriously needed a brush, marched forward and looked at him like he was a bit of road kill that had been festering for days.</p><p>&quot;Fags,&quot; she hissed. &quot;Should burn in hell.&quot; She opened up the jacket to reveal a white t-shirt, with a picture of a rainbow flag in flames. For the second time tonight all sound around Puck seemed to fall away and he just stared at the image. He looked up at her face.</p><p>Could someone really hate so much? Her face said yes and as the rest of her group took off their jackets to reveal similar shirts her hatred was shared. Seeing all this was like ice-water rushing down Puck's spine. It was one thing to know there were people who had such views but it was another to have it in his face. This wasn't some news report or blog &ndash; it was real and it was most definitely happening to him. He looked to Kurt for answers because while Puck could handle bullies and jocks who wanted to pick on weaker people he had no idea what to do here.</p><p>Kurt did not let him down and strutted over, poignantly ignoring the homophobic remarks thrown at him by the small group. He leaned into Puck, crossed his arms and gave the girl a once over. &quot;Honey,&quot; he said, addressing Puck and acting like the girl and her group no longer existed. &quot;I want to dance.&quot;</p><p>Puck grinned from ear to ear and held out his arm. &quot;Lead the way princess.&quot;</p><p>They walked right through the group, daring them to stand their ground &ndash; the hateful half-dozen faltered and moved to let them through, with Kurt leading. Puck felt pride burst through his heart; he had the biggest bad-ass boyfriend ever!</p><p>The group tried to follow and taunt them but were swallowed by the rest of the Glee club and everyone in the area joining Puck and Kurt on the dance floor. A top 50 number was playing so they danced along trying to act like nothing was wrong but for all their acting Puck sensed the tension. As he turned around he saw the haters join another group by the front door who were holding banners with similar slogans to the shirts. There was an old guy leading them in a priest collar and Puck shook his head &ndash; of course this had been arranged by some local fundamentalist Church. At least the goon squad were not joining them, from what Puck could see they seemed just as surprised as all the other students in the room &ndash; he knew those kids in the shirts seemed unfamiliar, they didn't even go to their school. As they tried to keep dancing the church group's chants grew louder and some students started to shout at them to shut up and get out.</p><p>This could get ugly real quick and Puck did a quick check of the people around him to make sure they could exit as a group if needed. He held Kurt tightly and forced a smile &ndash; this was not the night of gentle 'outing' he had in mind. He had expected some comments, some slurs and mocking from the more homophobic students but not this outright hate from a group that had specifically organised themselves to disrupt the dance. Shouts grew louder as the anti-gay group raised their voices and were matched by a good number of the student body trying to shout them down. At least that was a good sign but Puck knew how quick such a thing could turn around and checked for the twentieth time where the nearest exit was.</p><p>Where were the damned teachers and why hadn't they shut down the protestors yet? He saw a few of the faculty trying to talk with the preacher but the others had disappeared &ndash; why was he not surprised? As a gap opened in the crowd, which was getting increasingly unsettled, he saw Mr Schuester making his way towards the hate group with Figgins in tow. That made him feel a little better but he doubted they would have any more luck. It would probably take the cops to remove these people and they may not even turn up unless things got out of hand. As the shouting grew louder Puck felt his chest tighten and breathing suddenly seemed difficult. It shouldn't happen like this, all the work he'd put in with the anti-bullying and he couldn't even protect the people he loved at one school dance. Tears sprung to his eyes but at least he managed to get air to his lungs &ndash; this just wasn't right. He hung his head and barely moved to the music as the feeling of uselessness built within him.</p><p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Kurt virtually shouted in his ear and his hand forced Puck's head up to make eye contact. &quot;Don't you do that,&quot; warned Kurt. &quot;A few nutjobs can't bring us down okay.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is it always going to be this way,&quot; muttered Puck. &quot;Will it always have to be us against them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't know about that,&quot; said Kurt with a smile as he cocked his head to look over Puck's shoulder. &quot;Sometimes people surprise you.&quot;</p><p>Turning around Puck felt sure his jaw would hit the ground. Over by the hate group stood Karofsky and by his side like always Azimio &ndash; jabbing their fingers at the preacher and then pointing at the door. He smiled, who would have thought it possible? Just as he figured maybe he should go back up his former teammates a group of the goon squad beat him to it.</p><p>&quot;Shit,&quot; he swore. &quot;This is gonna be bad.&quot;</p><p>Amazingly though the goon squad moved to stand by Karofsky and Azimio, their body language saying they were also telling the hate group to get out.</p><p>&quot;What the hell?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have no idea,&quot; answered Kurt. &quot;Karofsky I can believe but those guys?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can thank Blaine,&quot; said Sam, joining the couple and dragging a blushing Blaine along. &quot;You should have seen it &ndash; went straight up and asked them what they thought of the banners and why they weren't backing up their classmates &ndash; none of them said they <i>agreed</i> with those slogans but they went on about free speech,&quot; Sam smiled and gave Blaine a one armed hug. &quot;So he said fair enough, maybe next time they'll turn up with ones saying women are just property and that black Americans should be moved to separate schools. It was so awesome.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're exaggerating,&quot; said Blaine, still blushing. &quot;I just tried to put it in perspective.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well it worked, well done Blaine,&quot; said Kurt.</p><p>&quot;Won't be enough,&quot; shrugged Blaine. &quot;I've seen these types before &ndash; they picket funerals for goodness sake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Short of violence what else can we do?&quot; asked Sam.</p><p>All the lights suddenly went out and the music stopped. After a few seconds just the lights at the top seats came on, showing Finn and Artie surrounded by the band members.</p><p>&quot;Sorry to interrupt the dancing,&quot; announced Finn, using a microphone that easily drowned out the yelling and shouting from the opposing groups. &quot;We'll play a song shortly but first I really need to speak with all the McKinley High students here tonight.&quot; He waited a few seconds as almost everyone turned and looked up to where he was. &quot;Thanks guys,&quot; he said in that typical Finn fashion that somehow made everyone like him. The hate group were continuing to chant but the sound system was far too powerful for them to overcome.</p><p>&quot;I'm a lucky guy,&quot; continued Finn. &quot;I've got a lot of friends&hellip; but I only ever had one best friend.&quot; He grinned down at Puck as Kurt squeezed his hand and leaned into him &ndash; Puck knew that he must be smiling like an idiot. &quot;And two times I've almost lost him - most recently it was cancer, but the first time,&quot; Finn paused and his smile faded. &quot;The first time was all my fault. He came to me with a secret, one which should have cemented the bond we've had since childhood but instead I allowed my fear, and my ignorance, to destroy it. But like I said, I'm a lucky guy &ndash; because I got him back. I can't change what happened, but neither can I ignore the fact that I spent so much time blaming him when I should have been standing by his side in support.&quot; The ceiling lights were coming back on but only on a low setting. &quot;Puck, I'm sorry - .&quot; Finn hesitated, looking like he'd forgotten what to say but Puck knew him better and could tell he was fighting back tears. &quot;You always called me your boy &ndash; and if I'd listened properly I would have known you were letting me know you loved me, so I love you too man.&quot;</p><p>Puck chuckled, only Finn could say that and make it <i>not</i> sound gay.</p><p>&quot;But enough about me,&quot; Finn's smile returned. &quot;We've had a good year McKinley &ndash; we've won games, singing comps, jazz recitals,&quot; he nodded to the band members around him as the crowd cheered. &quot;And made national headlines.&quot; A wave of muttering cut out the cheers. &quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Finn, putting on his stupid face. &quot;We're not proud of that?&quot; more murmurings met his words. &quot;So does anyone here, once they've left McKinley, want to be known to have come from <i>that</i> school? You know, the one famous for bullying? No?&quot; He searched the room but it was silent, even the hate group had stopped making noise. &quot;Then how about doing something about it!&quot; shouted Finn. &quot;Stop waiting for someone else to change things&hellip; and change it yourselves &ndash; would you like to make headlines for something good?&quot; A chorus of 'yes' filled the room. &quot;Then from this moment make it different,&quot; continued Finn. &quot;Stop the bullying, stop the hate. No-one is saying we all have to be friends, but is it too hard to just be friendly?&quot; Finn pointed at Puck. &quot;I stuffed up big time but got a second chance &ndash; but it wasn't until I accepted how wrong I was until that could happen.&quot; He stopped again and Puck was sure you could hear a pin drop, Finn had their total and utter attention. &quot;I want everyone right now to put up their hand if they want to change, put up your hand if you want zero tolerance on bullying and hate at McKinley High &ndash; let it be our choice to make this happen&hellip; let's take responsibility for our own actions.&quot; Finn put up his hand. &quot;Who's with me?&quot;</p><p>Just about everyone Puck could see put their hands up immediately. Through the crowd he saw some stragglers take a few seconds but eventually it certainly seemed like every hand was in the air; pretty impressive since not everyone here was actually a student of the school. He didn't have to look to see if the hate group had their hands up, that would be asking too much. Hearing laughter though he did turn and laughed himself, two of the haters had their hands in the air to the embarrassment of the rest of the group.</p><p>&quot;Okay!&quot; shouted Finn. &quot;Let's consider that a win and get on with some dancing &ndash; hit it guys.&quot;</p><p>The jazz band started up with a blues beat and Finn slipped on a fedora hat and sunglasses that matched his dark suit. As he started talking before singing Puck realised the need for the accessories and shouted his approval &ndash; he loved the Blues Brothers and wondered if that had helped Finn's song choice.</p><p>&quot;We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight and we would especially like to welcome all the representatives of the West Lima Baptist Church who have chosen to join us here for the Winter Ball at this time. We do sincerely hope you'll all enjoy the show and please remember people, that no matter who you are and what you do to live, thrive and survive, there're still some things that make us all the same. You, me, <i>them</i>, everybody&hellip; everybody.&quot;</p><p>The band revved up the beat and the song started properly. Not hesitating Puck grabbed Kurt around the waist and started dancing up close and personal.</p><p>&quot;<i>Everybody needs somebody<br />Everybody needs somebody to love, someone to love (Someone to love)<br />Sweetheart to miss (Sweetheart to miss)<br />Sugar to kiss (Sugar to kiss)<br />I need you, you, you (You, you, you)<br />I need you, you, you (You, you, you)<br />I need you, you, you (You, you, you) in the morning (I need) (You, you, you)<br />When my souls on fire (I need) (You, you, you)<br />Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside<br />When my baby mistreats me, I never, never, never have a place to hide<br />I need you</i>.&quot;</p><p>The crowd cheered as Finn sang, with Artie helping along on the chorus and bass notes. As he spun himself and Kurt around Puck could see everyone coupled up as you would expect. Some surprises included Mercedes and Karofsky and Quinn with Azimio. Puck laughed as he realized how soon the night had turned from terrible to awesome &ndash; and how it was all thanks to his friends and loved ones.</p><p>&quot;<i>Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside<br />When my baby mistreats me, I never, never, never have a place to hide<br />I need you, you, you<br />I need you, you, you (I need you)<br />I need you, you, you (I need you)<br />I need you, you, you (I need you)<br />(I need you) I need you; </i></p><p><i>&quot;You know people when you do find somebody<br />Hold that woman, hold that man<br />Love him, please him, squeeze her, please her, hold her<br />Squeeze and please that person, give 'em all your love<br />Signify your feelings with every gentle caress (Signify)<br />Because it's so important to have that special somebody<br />To hold (Hold), kiss (Kiss), miss (Miss), squeeze (Squeeze) and please (Please)&hellip;</i></p><p><i>&quot;Everybody needs somebody (I need you)<br />Everybody needs somebody to love (Everybody), someone to love (Needs somebody)<br />Sweetheart to miss (Everybody)<br />Sugar to kiss (Needs somebody)<br />I need you, you, you (You, you, you)<br />I need you, you, you (You, you, you)<br />I need you, you, you (You, you, you)<br />I need you, you, you (You, you, you)<br />I need you, you, you (Everybody)<br />I need you, you, you (Needs somebody)<br />I need you, you, you (Everybody)<br />I need you, you, you (Needs somebody)<br />In the morning (Everybody)<br />When my souls on fire (Needs somebody)<br />When I need that woman of mine (Everybody)<br />I need you, you, you, you (Needs somebody)<br />I need you, you, you, you (Everybody)<br />I need you, you, you (Needs somebody)<br />I need you!</i>.&quot;</p><p>The room erupted in cheers and calls for an encore. Puck almost checked to see what had happened to the church group but decided he didn't care, not when he had the love of his life in his arms and ready for a thorough kissing.</p><p>He didn't disappoint.</p><p>Tbc:</p></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><br />"

Every time Puck tried to speak Kurt shushed him, trying to process the information.</p><p>Revenge.</p><p>Puck's animosity to everyone.</p><p>The bullying.</p><p>Sure, on an intellectual level Kurt knew all this already. He'd known Puck had come out to Finn and whatever had happened had put in motion all these things; but to hear it from Puck made it real. Had Puck tormented him because he was different or because he was gay? For some reason it was important that it was the former.</p><p>The fact that Puck could act in such a calculated manner to enact vengeance confused him; the boy he had come to know... could he still be capable of such things?</p><p>Those thoughts must have shown on his face because Puck sighed and stood, forcing Kurt to stop pacing. &quot;Kurt,&quot; he spread his hands. &quot;I'm not perfect, you knew that and I can be an asshole, you knew that too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Admitting it makes it okay?&quot; Kurt huffed. &quot;Its not what you did to Finn, he kind of deserved it &ndash; but what about Quinn?&quot;</p><p>Puck hung his head. &quot;I regretted it the moment it happened, probably before. Why do you think I never told anyone, well not at first anyway?&quot;</p><p>That made a little more sense. If Puck had wanted to hurt Finn at any cost then he would have told him about the affair immediately, instead he never did and probably wouldn't have but then Quinn fell pregnant.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Kurt said softly. &quot;I'm not angry exactly, just confused &ndash; I'm going to get ready upstairs.&quot;</p><p>KPKPKPKPKP</p><p>&quot;Kurt,&quot; Puck said uselessly to the retreating figure.</p><p>&quot;You know, just when I think you've got it right you manage to screw things up,&quot; Finn said from behind him.</p><p>&quot;How much did you hear?&quot; sighed Puck, turning to face his friend.</p><p>Finn shrugged, wiping away the last of some water from his torso. &quot;Enough to know I should be angry, but in some strange way I'm relieved you cheated on my girlfriend for revenge, instead of a whim.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're just weird Hudson.&quot;</p><p>Smiling as he towelled his hair Finn ignored the remark. &quot;Kurt will be okay, he's big on the trust and being honourable and all that &ndash; but he's also very forgiving.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, hope so.&quot; Puck moved to take a shower himself. &quot;Hey Finn, you know I'm not that guy anymore right?&quot;</p><p>Finn gave him a hard look then shrugged again. &quot;Neither am I dude.&quot;</p><p>In the bathroom Puck quickly showered and leaned on the basin, deciding a shave was in order. Luckily he knew Finn kept spare blades and slipped one into the razor. He lathered up and inspected his face before swiping down one side. In was in these moments that Puck could properly think about things. It was like while his hands concentrated on one task his mind could mull over another and naturally it was all about Kurt. Telling him the story was risky but had he kept it from him it would have ruined them in the long run, and Puck knew that he was in this for however long Kurt could stand him. His hand shook a bit as he did his chin and he swore softly. Everyone might think he was back to normal but it was the little things that sometimes let him down. His treatments were now once a fortnight but they still exhausted him and then the constant check-ups and scans; still with no definitive result.</p><p>The doctors smiled a lot and said it looked good and 'there was every chance' but as for being given the all clear &ndash; none were willing to take that step. Had he told Kurt?</p><p>No, Puck was still a coward when it came to that.</p><p>He tried to finish shaving but his hand shook again and nicked his throat, eliciting another swear word.</p><p>He heard the door close behind him, though he had not heard it open and knew it was Kurt.</p><p>&quot;Here,&quot; said his boyfriend softly and took the razor from his hand, Puck giving it up wordlessly and just staring at Kurt, not sure if he understand how much he felt for him in this one moment. Making short work of the remaining stubble Kurt washed off his face and smoothed his fingers across the delicate skin before leaning to press a kiss against his lips. Smiling into the kiss Puck wrapped an arm around Kurt's waist to bring him closer, clad only in a towel Puck was unsure how far this might go.</p><p>&quot;We don't have time,&quot; whispered Kurt throatily.</p><p>Puck recognised lust when he heard it and knew it matched his own.</p><p>&quot;We do tonight,&quot; he whispered back and lifted Kurt onto the basin, making him yelp and cling to Puck even harder.</p><p>At a guess Puck figured he was forgiven.</p><p>KPKPKPKPKPKP</p><p>&quot;This is the stupidest thing I've ever done,&quot; muttered Sam in the limo.</p><p>Puck coughed &quot;Bieber&quot; under his breath to the giggles of the vehicle's other occupants.</p><p>Sam glared but didn't pursue it, instead fingering his bow-tie. &quot;I mean sure, we've talked on the phone and been IMing each other but I've really only met him once and I was kind of concussed.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So this is just the first date, no biggie,&quot; Finn said.</p><p>Putting his head in his hands Sam groaned loudly. &quot;Exactly! A first date at a ball, how can we make small talk in that scenario?&quot;</p><p>Finn scratched his head. &quot;That's why you're worried? I thought its because everyone will be looking at you since&hellip; you know, two guys?&quot;</p><p>Four sets of eyes stared him down, including Quinn's.</p><p>&quot;Honey,&quot; she said softly. &quot;We're gonna work on that foot and mouth thing okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Anyway,&quot; said Puck. &quot;All eyes will be on the hottest couple.&quot; He puffed himself up and flexed an arm to the eye-rolls of everyone.</p><p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Kurt slowly, turning his head to the side. &quot;The blonde brunette mix <i>will</i> be hard to beat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Finn, nodding and putting an arm around Quinn.</p><p>&quot;So not talking about you,&quot; smiled Kurt.</p><p>There was nothing said as everyone chuckled at Finn's expression of mock hurt until Sam sighed again.</p><p>&quot;Do you think Blaine has abs&hellip; I bet he does &ndash; he looks like he has abs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Quinn laughed. &quot;I was going out with a twelve year old girl and never knew it.&quot;</p><p>Sam stared at her without really looking, or listening. Would Blaine sing to him tonight, as a fellow Glee clubber it was something he would probably do? In that case he would have to have a song ready to respond. Maybe even he could initiate the serenade. Rubbing his still tender jaw Sam went through a mental list of possibilities and completely ignored whatever conversations were going on around him. Luckily Kurt had put something on his face to cover the still visible bruises but the pain remained and the stitches could not be hidden. That combined with his never having been out with a guy before did almost overload his already overburdened insecurities. Thank goodness he was surrounded by such a good support group.</p><p>KPKPKPKPKPKP</p><p>&quot;And I think we've lost him,&quot; said Kurt, clicking his fingers in front of Sam's unresponsive eyes. &quot;Not that he was allocated any duties, for what is now an obvious reason.&quot;</p><p>He pulled out his phone to go through the list.</p><p>&quot;Food and nibbles for the after party.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Check,&quot; Finn said proudly, as if that had been the hardest duty.</p><p>&quot;Exclusive invites sent and RSVPs received for the after-party?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Check, although Santana's post-it with just a lip print may or not be a yes for attendance.&quot; Quinn's eyes narrowed for a second mentioning Santana's name but Kurt noticed she shook it off after a touch from Finn; not as stupid as he often seemed.</p><p>&quot;Alcohol?&quot; Kurt asked flatly, looking at his boyfriend. Puck simply gave a toothy grin.</p><p>&quot;A volunteer to distract Rachel so she doesn't start singing&hellip; oh that's me.&quot; Kurt smirked and put the phone away. &quot;Then the only thing is to have an exit strategy &ndash; I do assume we want to stay long enough to enjoy the dancing but not long enough to see teachers dancing with each other?&quot; What he really meant was the longer they remained the more chance of a confrontation between them and either the hockey team goons or some intoxicated jerk intent on having a fight.</p><p>&quot;How 'bout when Mr Shue drunk texts his ex-wife?&quot; asked Puck.</p><p>&quot;Or sings a sappy 'I want you' love song to a certain guidance counsellor?&quot; suggested Quinn.</p><p>Kurt rolled his eyes. &quot;That man has to get his house in order, perhaps we should give Miss Holliday a call; I detected a certain spark between them last time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Schue can't handle a woman like that,&quot; said Puck, earning him a sharp glance from Kurt. &quot;Oh, we're here,&quot; he continued instead of explaining his comment.</p><p>The group piled out of the limo and the driver sped off without a word; Kurt figured that's what you get for a discount price &ndash; also it was one way, no pick up later. He lingered, allowing the others to go ahead and thankfully Puck was observant enough to stay with him.</p><p>KPKPKPKPKP</p><p>Will Shuester was not a stupid man. He knew that sometimes the best thing a teacher could do is let students make their own mistakes. How many times had he seen what was going down in the Glee club and done nothing? Too often? Not enough?</p><p>He could admit he was far from perfect but was confident he'd done the best possible.</p><p>That is until Puck, of all people, had called him on it. Then again should he be surprised that Puck was the only one brave enough to call him a hypocrite &ndash; scratch that, only current student.</p><p>Kurt would not have hesitated either. Any shock that they had got together should have been alleviated by that common fact.</p><p>Since Puck had made it clear Will was just as guilty as other teachers for ignoring the bullying he had tried his best to change that. Now he never walked past anything even remotely suspicious. He had sponsored the start of several clubs designed to help students suffering from anything from bullying to harassment to just being isolated. He had even gone to the last two school board meetings to champion the site Puck and the others had created (never admitting of course that he knew who was involved). That support had earned him a warning and some off-the-record threats from half the board. It was hard to understand what they feared the most &ndash; McKinley being in the national spotlight for all the wrong reasons or actually having to admit there was a problem. Their interest still seemed to be shutting down the students who wanted to stop the bullying instead of dealing with problem of bullying.</p><p>It was simply cheaper and easier to ignore a problem.</p><p>Or in this case muddy the waters.</p><p>&quot;William,&quot; Figgins explained as he adjusted his suit jacket in his small office mirror. &quot;I know your concerns but these students have a right to protest, just as your students have.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is not a protest,&quot; said Will in exasperation. He held up the shirt he had confiscated; on it were two male figures like on bathroom doors, except they were holding hands and across this image were a circle and diagonal cross. &quot;This is persecution.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They are just expressing their views according to their faith,&quot; Figgins spread his hands. &quot;There is nothing I can do, the board majority voted that this kind of non-violent protest was acceptable.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Saying no to gay people being in school cannot be acceptable,&quot; countered Will.</p><p>&quot;As I understand it they are just asking not to be exposed to something that offends them, we do not discriminate at this school but displays of affection or inappropriate behaviour that offends others is something I must take very seriously.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You're kidding right,&quot; Will laughed without humour. &quot;Just yesterday a footballer was caught naked with a Cheerio in the study hall &ndash; you did nothing about it.&quot;</p><p>Figgins went to answer when the office door slammed open and an enraged Sue walked in; Will took a step back thinking she was here to attack him but instead she raised a shaking finger to the principle.</p><p>&quot;You are in big trouble mister!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sue! I am in a <i>private</i> meeting.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh keep your flight stockings on,&quot; she retaliated. &quot;There hasn't been a private meeting in here since I had maintenance re-divert the air-ducts so I can hear every word &ndash; by the way, if you ever sing Madonna's <i>Like a Virgin</i> again I will call amnesty international and report you for crimes against humanity.&quot;</p><p>Serious as this was Will couldn't hide a smirk.</p><p>&quot;Now for the equally heinous but probably lesser crime I believe you are allowing religious views to once again permeate our secular halls?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No no no,&quot; Figgins tried to say soothingly. &quot;No-one is promoting religion; there is simply a board directive to allow non-violent protest by students who believe they are being marginalised due to their faith.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Marginalised?&quot; Sue snorted. &quot;Try being this white and marching for women's rights in the Sudan. May I remind you Figgins that we, as educators, have the sacred duty to ensure our students are not misused or taken advantage of while under our care.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exactly Sue, and this Rainbow website is making some of our students the targets of the leftist liberal agenda.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh please, the only people suffering are the ones refusing to accept responsibility for their own actions &ndash; they hurt others and now cannot stand being held to account.&quot;</p><p>Will was impressed; Sue was using words direct from Puck's website.</p><p>&quot;These shirts,&quot; continued Sue, pointing at the offending garment. &quot;Were not made by students and I guarantee they didn't come up with the idea to wear them to this school or tonight's ball &ndash; it is those students who are being used as pawns and so are you.&quot;</p><p>Figgins probably should have lost his temper but instead Will noticed the man visibly deflate. &quot;There is nothing I can do; the board has made the decision.&quot;</p><p>Sue shook her head and her anger also disappeared as she took a seat and crossed her hands patiently. &quot;There is a lot you can do, and so can we. I may be guilty of pushing these kids around and yes, possibly I have used them for my own agenda by pitting them against each other, but if there is something Sue Silvester is capable of it is admitting her mistakes and learning from them. I might despise being in the same room as the two of you but now and then I am reminded that we do have one inherently good thing in common &ndash; we're obviously not here just for the money, which leaves either a penchant for self harm in Williams case, or the possibility that we are actually here for the kids.&quot; She gave that half smile which Will had yet to decipher meant she was joking or was enjoying tormenting him. &quot;And as someone said '<i>If we are to teach real peace in this world, and if we are to carry on a real war against war, we shall have to begin with the children</i>'.&quot;</p><p>Shaking his head Figgins gave a smile of his own. &quot;Using Mohandas against me Sue, you are being very devious.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not against you, just bringing it into perspective &ndash; I never thought I'd be the one to say it but why the hell don't we institute a zero tolerance on bullying or any kind of intolerant behaviour?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because for every student that is suspended there are parents going straight to the board, and then to court if their suspension is upheld &ndash; we can't afford the legal battle.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe I can help with that,&quot; said Sue smugly. &quot;I have some contacts in a few law firms, I'm sure they have some juniors needing to do some pro-bono work.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We would still have the board to deal with,&quot; added Will. &quot;They'll fire us all before holding up suspensions that will mean forfeiting most of our sports games &ndash; especially since some of the kids are their own.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not if the kids themselves agree to the suspensions,&quot; said Sue, inspecting her fingernails.</p><p>&quot;How are we going to do that?&quot; asked Figgins in disbelief.</p><p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Sue, her eyes twinkling in what usually implied an impending strike. &quot;What use are the Cheerios and Glee club if they can't inspire some good old fashioned school spirit?&quot;</p><p>Will winced inside; he just knew it would come down to him and his kids.</p><p>Figgins, wrapping a silk scarf around his neck smiled again. &quot;What about it William, if you get the kids to agree to the punishments I will see what I can do about convincing the board to trial zero-tolerance.&quot;</p><p>He sighed, but then knew if he didn't at least try he was not just letting himself down. &quot;Fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Excellent, now &ndash; don't we have a dance to supervise.&quot;</p><p>KPKPKPKPKP</p><p>There may have been only a dozen steps to the entry but Kurt continued to hold Puck back, his boyfriend giving him a puzzled look.</p><p>&quot;Last chance Noah,&quot; Kurt said in explanation.</p><p>&quot;For what,&quot; replied Puck with a leer as he pulled Kurt close. &quot;To ravish you in privacy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hardly private,&quot; muttered Kurt, glancing at a couple that seemingly ignored them as they walked past. &quot;And no, I mean you can back out now &ndash; your reputation will remain intact.&quot;</p><p>Puck remained quiet for several seconds, his expression hardening and Kurt wondered if maybe he was considering the offer.</p><p>&quot;You embarrassed to be seen with me Hummel?&quot; Puck asked instead.</p><p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; scoffed Kurt. &quot;We can to all the dances you like at my school, and wherever else we can be us &ndash; without the Neanderthals at this school knowing.&quot;</p><p>Puck suddenly pushed him back and turned away. &quot;Not too long ago I was one of those thugs Kurt &ndash; you think I would be afraid of those losers?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I think,&quot; Kurt whispered, putting a hand on his shoulder. &quot;That you've done enough for now &ndash; the website, the whole movement, and all the time you spend with me... you don't have anything to prove, not if you don't need to and I don't want you getting sick again from the stress.&quot;</p><p>He could see Puck tilt his head to the sky and sigh loudly, saying just loudly enough for Kurt to hear, &quot;Survival is not enough.&quot;</p><p>Those words again made the blood in Kurt's veins run cold. Puck had said them before but he thought it a fluke, to hear them again from his mouth when he knew they came from someone long dead meant something else entirely. &quot;What did you say?&quot; said Kurt flatly, even though he knew.</p><p>Puck turned to him, his eyes sad yet defiant in the low light. &quot;I think you know.&quot;</p><p>Kurt gulped and felt tears spring to his eyes. &quot;You can't... she's dead Puck, she died when I was a kid.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Puck softly, grabbing Kurt's hand with his own and bringing them both to Kurt's chest. &quot;But she's still here with you &ndash; you know that.&quot; He used his other hand to lift Kurt's chin to make him keep eye contact. &quot;And I died too Kurt, not for long but enough to meet this beautiful and smart woman who helped me see things I knew but refused to face.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's impossible,&quot; Kurt almost cried. &quot;There is no heaven Puck.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Maybe not, I didn't meet any angels or speak with God, but I saw what I needed and I met your mother.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Puck hissed. &quot;And you know its true, you know because you feel her around you all the time. She's there every time you cry, in your laughter and when you're in pain.&quot; His face softened and he kissed Kurt lightly on the lips. &quot;You're the strongest person I know Kurt, but no-one could put up with what's been thrown at you and be okay, not without help. You know she's been there for you if you want to admit it or not. You accused me often enough of refusing to show what I know to be true, of saying one thing but meaning another &ndash; but it doesn't have to make sense to be true. Your Mom loves you Kurt, more than anything, more than her need to move on.&quot; Puck tapped the scar on his head. &quot;You told me once about calling fire because its tangible... real, that even though you say it when other shit is going down people will listen and that's what's important. Kurt, it doesn't matter how your Mom died, or if she didn't fight hard enough &ndash; she never left you, she's been shouting fire all these years so you would know she is there... you have to admit that, and then let her go.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; asked Kurt.</p><p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Puck let his concern show. &quot;It took me a while to see it but she didn't meet me just so I could save your life &ndash; it was to let you live it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The dumpster?&quot; Kurt frowned. They'd mentioned some dream or vision of Puck's but so much was going on he had forgotten.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, she showed me a possibility and then the fact I could change it. Maybe I could have done it differently so Sam didn't have to get hurt but that's just it &ndash; we can't hope to make everything perfect, we just have to do what we can to live... and not just survive.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And to do that I have to let her go?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have to <i>forgive</i> her Kurt. There is no doubt your Mom loved you but fighting something she couldn't beat, just to exist &ndash; it was never going to be enough. I think she gave up because she loved you so much, not because she didn't.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I... I've always known she was with me,&quot; Kurt finally admitted, the tears flowing down his cheeks. &quot;Even at her funeral I could feel her hand grab mine, her whisper in my ear and her perfume on the wind &ndash; but I could never say anything, they'd say I was mad.&quot; He smiled and wiped away the tears. &quot;Whenever I'm at my lowest she's there, a presence to comfort me.&quot; He looked hard at Puck. &quot;I think I forgave her a long time ago but I've never said the words, and I will,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;But not yet, just for tonight I still need her.&quot;</p><p>Puck grinned and pulled him close. &quot;She'll be here tonight Kurt, to watch you dance with your first boyfriend... to show everyone that you have a right to be happy &ndash; and to see that someone can love you without having to hide it.&quot;</p><p>Kurt's eyes widened at the admission and he knew a goofy grin had spread across his own face. &quot;Love?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Puck tilted his head. &quot;I love you Kurt Hummel, and you're going to walk in there on my arm and everyone is going to know it.&quot;</p><p>Kurt felt his stomach do that whole flip-flop thing he'd only read about in silly romance stories and his heart beat too fast against his ribcage.</p><p>Noah Puckerman was in love with him!</p><p>How the heck could he respond? He didn't even have a song prepared and simple words were inadequate.</p><p>&quot;Come on,&quot; Puck tugged him towards the doors, taking any chance to talk away. In a daze Kurt grabbed his boyfriend's arm and together they walked through the entry, the bright lights of the dance enveloping them.</p><p>Tbc...</p><p>Yes, next chapter... the Winter Ball at last!</p></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p></div><noad></noad>"

Between power out and lending a hand where I could, writing took a back seat, but I had some time today and here we are.&nbsp; Can I add what a delight it was to see many links and sites up in support of the victims - it brought tears to my eyes.&nbsp; In this country we pride ourselves on lending a hand to those in need, to our friends, family and strangers alike, but it is still surprising and a little humbling to see volunteers, estimated in the tens of thousands, getting out and helping flood victims.&nbsp;

there is finally some intimate action taking place.</i><br /><br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Chapter 8""><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Jarrod watched carefully and tried not to sweat as Morgana Le Fay poured him some mulled wine and passed it across.&nbsp;Having drinks with the lady, alone &ndash; was enough to incur the King&rsquo;s wrath and that was something Jarrod was eager to avoid, especially given what he had already done for Arthur.&nbsp;Freeing the Prince had been easy enough but covering up his role in it was a little more difficult.&nbsp;Never-the-less he had thought himself successful, until now.</p><p>&ldquo;I find myself starved of company with Arthur gone, of course I would never admit that to him Jarrod,&rdquo; she said simply, staring at him over the goblet.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Jarrod answered, hoping no answer would suffice.&nbsp;The wine was spiced in the manner he liked, something only the tavern owner in main street should know &ndash; Morgana had studied him and this made her either very careful, or dangerous&hellip; perhaps both.</p><p>&ldquo;Merlin too,&rdquo; she continued.&nbsp;&ldquo;He always made me laugh, and I knew there was more to him than just an inept servant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More you say?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed quietly but never broke eye contact.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin is destined for great things &ndash; all he needs do is survive being around Arthur.&rdquo;</p><p>This made Jarrod smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;I would think it the other way my Lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mn.&rdquo;&nbsp;Her expression said she had considered this.&nbsp;&ldquo;Perhaps a little of both then.&rdquo;</p><p>She was surely a study in high court style.&nbsp;Dark and beautiful yet unafraid to show her intelligence; other of her rank would twitter away the day and never involve themselves in important matters.&nbsp;It was no secret that Morgana held the King&rsquo;s ear, and also had eyes and ears throughout Camelot.&nbsp;The Peers of the realm dismissed her as irrelevant, a possible marriage to further their privilege but not a one, Jarrod was sure, knew that Morgana&rsquo;s true worth would lay in her mind and not her body.&nbsp;All Jarrod had to find out for the here and now was if Morgana was an ally.&nbsp;She had known enough to invite him here where they could speak in private &ndash; depending on what she said would reveal her intentions, or more likely &ndash; what she didn&rsquo;t say.</p><p>&ldquo;I have only recently arrived in Camelot my Lady, long enough to attain a position in the guard and meet the Prince but I would think it too soon to comment further.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well said Guardsman, but then you act as if I have asked a question, and as yet&hellip; I have not.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes drilled into Jarrod and he felt sweat break out on his forehead.&nbsp;He had faced inquisitors who had drawn less fear than this woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Arthur and Merlin should be back here, Uther would forgive Arthur and perhaps even Merlin if only father and son would talk &nbsp;&ndash; I think you agree&hellip; no!&rdquo;&nbsp;she prevented him saying anything.&nbsp;&ldquo;That was not a question.&nbsp;It may be that you had a hand in Arthur&rsquo;s escape, perhaps you may know where he is&hellip; and I want him to know something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Jarrod hesitated, her expression let him know he needed to be very careful how he answered.&nbsp;&ldquo;As a royal guard my loyalty, as always, is to the crown.&nbsp;If I knew where the Prince was it would surely be my duty to tell the King.&rdquo;</p><p>Morgana smiled, it was both intoxicating and sent a shiver down Jarrod&rsquo;s spine.&nbsp;Dangerous did not begin to describe this woman yet he was captivated none-the-less.&nbsp;Where romance was concerned he had always been tempted with the more dangerous liaisons &ndash; and she was drawing him in like none before.</p><p>&ldquo;And if I knew you to be involved it would be only honourable for me to inform Uther.&rdquo;&nbsp;She used the King&rsquo;s name so casually, letting Jarrod know that if it came to it &ndash; Jarrod&rsquo;s word would count for nothing if he betrayed her.</p><p>&ldquo;It is just as well then my Lady, that we each know nothing of import &ndash; King Uther can rest easy that there is no insurrection here.&rdquo;</p><p>This time her laugh was higher, it echoed in the room and made something in Jarrod&rsquo;s chest tighten &ndash; he hoped it was the beginning of love and not a sense of impending doom.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew I would like you Jarrod.&rdquo;&nbsp;Morgana poured more wine and Jarrod eagerly accepted.&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course, if by chance word could get to Arthur I would want him to know this,&rdquo; she hesitated and for the first time Jarrod saw doubt in her eyes.&nbsp;It faded when Jarrod boldly took one of her hands and nodded, saying nothing but letting her know everything.</p><p>&ldquo;I have had a vision,&rdquo; she said confidently and squeezed back.&nbsp;&ldquo;And it is something Arthur must hear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can only -,&rdquo; Jarrod paused as a commotion made itself known outside.&nbsp;He cocked his head, at first thinking it was simply a fallen tray but then the clang of metal on metal was clear, followed by a strangled cry.&nbsp;In an instant he was at the door and peered out, through the crack he saw a guardsman on the floor, a puddle of blood growing underneath him.&nbsp;Standing over him was a man in the colours of Sir Hynd, three more joined him and one spied Jarrod looking.&nbsp;Jarrod slammed the door and slid the bolt home.</p><p>&ldquo;They have attacked sooner than I expected,&rdquo; he muttered and quickly gathered his jacket and weapons from Morgana&rsquo;s side table.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she demanded, not a hint of fear in her voice but just concern.&nbsp;His opinion of her was raised.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir Hynd&rsquo;s soldiers are in the city, he will be after the crown.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Traitorous swine,&rdquo; swore Morgana and opened a cabinet, pulling out some garments and a sword and dagger.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uther will have him gutted.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning away while she changed Jarrod tried not to grin; dangerous as this day was becoming he could not help but feel that it might be worth it.&nbsp;&ldquo;The King may be in some trouble, with the knights halved and the city guard mostly out searching for Arthur Hynd has chosen an excellent time to attack.&rdquo;</p><p>Morgana walked into his field of vision.&nbsp;She was now dressed in breeches and a long overcoat, sword strapped to her side and the dagger nowhere to be seen &ndash; his face turned red as possibilities abounded.&nbsp;There had been no discussion but there was no need &ndash; they were in this together.</p><p>&ldquo;Alone we can do little but Arthur will not allow Uther to come to harm &ndash; can you get me to him?&rdquo; Morgana asked, tying her hair back.</p><p>&ldquo;Once outside the city,&rdquo; he answered without giving too much away.&nbsp;He was beginning to trust her but there were limits &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t just his head on the block.</p><p>Morgana grinned at his deflection and walked to the opposite wall, a tug on the lantern opened a section and she waved a hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to that but first we need to see a friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Nothing else was said as they moved quickly down the hidden stairs.&nbsp;At first Jarrod was not alarmed, hidden passages were common and necessary.&nbsp;After a while though his brow furrowed in consternation &ndash; if his calculations were correct they had gone down further than the lower ramparts.&nbsp;How could they leave the city if the were too far under the castle?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They finally entered a hallway that seemed a little more used and Morgana grabbed a fresh lantern and moved over to another set of steps that disappeared even further into the darkness, which meant a long way down.&nbsp;At his expression she smirked and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me guardsman, how much elemental lore did they teach in Rome?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Elemental?&rdquo;&nbsp;He had no idea what she was talking about.</p><p>Morgana leaned forward and her expression went serious.&nbsp;Her next word made ice flow though his veins.</p><p>&ldquo;Dragons.&rdquo;</p><p><u>Deathbite Marshes</u></p><p>Shivering only slightly as he removed shirt and breeches Arthur rinsed them in the clean running water of the small creek and considered his undergarments.&nbsp;He had not encountered a soul in these lands so modesty was not really an issue but there was the sneaking suspicion he was being watched, so the smalls remained on.&nbsp;Only once he had the wet clothes hanging on some branches did he consider what to do next.&nbsp;He should be hunting, a rabbit or perhaps fish &ndash; but his appetite had been gone for weeks.&nbsp;Arthur wished he knew why &ndash; he wasn&rsquo;t sick and didn&rsquo;t seem to suffer from the lack of food, except for losing quite a bit of weight.&nbsp;His strength remained and his sleep was sound.&nbsp;It was, like so many things recently, a mystery.</p><p>Fetching his sword he spent the time sharpening the edge, it was a duty normally left to Merlin and Arthur lost himself in it.&nbsp;Even when it had been Merlin doing it Arthur could watch him for hours, the look of concentration and determination to get the edge perfect.&nbsp;Every now and then Merlin&rsquo;s tongue would poke out, just slightly, and wet his lips.&nbsp;He&rsquo;d wipe his hair back and stretch some taut muscles &ndash; all while Arthur watched.&nbsp;At this memory Arthur sniggered, how had he not realised his&hellip; affection for Merlin earlier?&nbsp;Quite obviously the feeling was returned but it nagged at Arthur that Merlin had not found him yet.&nbsp;Surely the warlock could locate him.&nbsp;For Arthur&rsquo;s part he felt sure he could point in the direction Merlin was, just not how far.&nbsp;He would have gone too but needed to be both close enough to Camelot to be there when needed but not close enough to be caught by patrols.</p><p>Staring at his clothes, the sword forgotten Arthur could see they would not be dry for hours.&nbsp;It was too damp for a fire.&nbsp;He swore to himself and glared harder at the shirt and breeches.&nbsp;&ldquo;Just be bloody dry already.&rdquo;&nbsp;There was whispered inside his head and it was like a new connection was made, something like feeling a muscle lock into place.&nbsp;His vision turned a golden red for a single moment and in a flash the shirt steamed and Arthur knew it was dry.&nbsp;Testing it for sure it was probably the driest thing in a dozen leagues, so crisp were the cuffs.</p><p>&ldquo;Neat trick, can you do the pants?&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur leapt up at the voice, reaching for a sword that was out of reach and realising he was mostly naked while holding only a shirt.&nbsp;He saw who had spoken and relaxed, but only by a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Lancelot?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; nodded the dark haired man.&nbsp;For himself he was fully dressed, his clothing was simple but fit perfectly and the sword was sheathed, no ill intent was evident in his posture.</p><p>Arthur decided he had no reason to be bashful around Lancelot and stared at the pants, in a flash they too were dry and he grinned to himself, take that Merlin &ndash; he could do magic too.&nbsp;Laughter from Lancelot made him frown.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; murmured Lancelot.&nbsp;&ldquo;But for a moment your smile looked just like Merlin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mm umm,&rdquo; nodded Arthur and slipped on the shirt but left it unbuttoned, the cool air was starting to bite but it was not yet too cold.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to assume you&rsquo;ve seen him recently and this is no chance meeting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He would have come in person but matters overrode that possibility,&rdquo; apologised Lancelot.&nbsp;Strangely he really did seem sorry and Arthur tilted his head in question.&nbsp;Did Lancelot know&hellip; did the whole bloody world know?</p><p>Leaving the pants for the moment Arthur finally remembered his manners and strode over, giving his arm to Lancelot who did not hesitate to take it.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is good to see a friendly face &ndash; did Merlin tell you everything?&rdquo;</p><p>Lancelot hesitated then nodded slowly.&nbsp;His whole body language cried out that he wanted to speak but something was holding him back.&nbsp;Had Arthur been feeling more himself he would have demanded to know, or maybe even threatened Lancelot &ndash; but he didn&rsquo;t, and instead stepped back and gestured to a log.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come, sit &ndash; you must be exhausted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you sire, it has been a long trip &ndash; and tracking you was not easy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; snorted Arthur as he joined Lancelot on the log, &ldquo;I do have some skill in survival you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So does Merlin it seems,&rdquo; said Lancelot, a hand ghosting up to hold a charm sitting at his neckline.&nbsp;Arthur could not remember him wearing it last they met but it had been awhile and Lancelot had probably travelled quite a bit since then.&nbsp;&ldquo;He suspects he is being watched my lord and sent me &ndash; the two of you together may have been too tempting a target.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; nodded Arthur and allowed himself to relax just a little bit.&nbsp;Knowing Lancelot could find him had put him on guard, wondering the same as Merlin had &ndash; was he being watched?&nbsp;If he was they would have pounced by now, his weapons out of reach and both of them seated.</p><p>&ldquo;So Lancelot, you have a message&hellip; for&hellip; me,&rdquo; his voice trailed off as Arthur looked at the other man.&nbsp;The charm was now glowing a soft red and Lancelot&rsquo;s eyes glowed gold for a moment before the man&rsquo;s hand came up and gently caressed his cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;I have missed you Arthur.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur eyes went wide as he felt the flow of magic emanating from Lancelot. &nbsp;His body had not changed but his smile and eyes belonged to someone else.</p><p>&ldquo;Merlin?&rdquo;</p><p>Lancelot leaned forward until his lips were almost to Arthur&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, my body remains far away but Lancelot has leant me his so we could meet.&rdquo;</p><p>It was whispered and although the words came from Lancelot&rsquo;s throat they had the slight lilt that was Merlin&rsquo;s provincial accent.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this like what you did to me?&rdquo; whispered Arthur.&nbsp;&ldquo;Because that didn&rsquo;t end so well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alive aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Lancelot as Merlin said rather arrogantly.&nbsp;As Arthur looked into the other&rsquo;s eyes it was becoming easier to think of him as Merlin.&nbsp;Lancelot&rsquo;s head moved further in and lips ghosted across his ear.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is different, Lancelot is still here but&hellip; looking the other way &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it better.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur allowed his own hand to move to the other&rsquo;s chest but he felt, as he knew he would, not Merlin&rsquo;s lean musculature but the sleeker Lancelot&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is wrong, Lancelot would not-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He offered Arthur, its fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;Lancelot&rsquo;s face once more filled his vision, but the smirk was most definitely Merlin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Close your eyes, they see too much and are easily fooled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Merlin that&rsquo;s ridiculous, seeing or not I know this isn&rsquo;t properly you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Close your eyes,&rdquo; Lancelot&rsquo;s eyes blazed a little red and Arthur felt himself obeying.&nbsp;May as well try it he thought.&nbsp;Without sight he relied on other senses.&nbsp;Lancelot still felt, well he still felt like Lancelot.&nbsp;Just to be sure Arthur snaked his hand around and rested it on Lancelot&rsquo;s hip &ndash; that was much the same as Merlin&rsquo;s and the illusion strengthened.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Merlin&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, touch me as Merlin, not as Lancelot.&nbsp;Hear me as Merlin&hellip; know me as Merlin.&rdquo;</p><p>Arthur breathed in and incredibly the scent was indeed of Merlin; earthy and of peaches.&nbsp;The heat he felt coming through Lancelot&rsquo;s clothes was Merlin&rsquo;s &ndash; his hand moved up and under the shirt.&nbsp;Snug as it was there was room and the skin was Merlin and yet not.&nbsp;Merlin was right, there was no way to describe it.</p><p>&ldquo;Merlin,&rdquo; Arthur finally said with hunger and crushed his lips against the other man&rsquo;s.&nbsp;Merlin responded with a whimper and opened his lips, allowing Arthur to take the lead.&nbsp;The prince did and leaned into Merlin, using one hand to undo the shirt and the other to clasp his neck and lean him back.&nbsp;He nuzzled Merlin&rsquo;s neck and gently nipped his ear, eliciting an excited gasp.&nbsp;Merlin&rsquo;s hand splayed across his chest and circled one nipple, plucking it gently before sliding down Arthur&rsquo;s stomach to hover at his navel &ndash; there he waited as if building for the kill.</p><p>&ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; whispered Merlin between kisses.&nbsp;&ldquo;Waited so long for this &ndash; not sure I can-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just shut up Merlin,&rdquo; laughed Arthur, firmly keeping his eyes shut to maintain the illusion.&nbsp;He moved his own hand across the now naked chest and traced a line down the rippled abdomen &ndash; he knew that definitely wasn&rsquo;t Merlin but at this point it didn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp;It was Merlin he was making love to, regardless what body he wore.&nbsp;Lancelot had worn breeches that separated easily and stretched to allow his hand inside &ndash; if Arthur were suspicious he would think that devious of him, as if he had known what Arthur and Merlin would do.&nbsp;Merlin gasped loudly as Arthur held his manhood and gently squeezed, bringing him to full hardness before slowly stroking him.&nbsp;His own cock was straining at his underclothes and Merlin felt him through them, his nimble fingers dancing across Arthur&rsquo;s tip and circling underneath.&nbsp;Gasping in ever quicker breaths Arthur knew what Merlin had been trying to say &ndash; they had both waited so long, this would not be a protracted coupling.&nbsp;Merlin was hot in his hand, heavy and with impressive girth &ndash; a small part of Arthur registered that he should not be impressed with Merlin so much as Lancelot&hellip; but only a small part.</p><p>His stroking quickened as he felt his own orgasm build.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin I-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No talking, remember,&rdquo; snapped Merlin and covered his mouth with his own.&nbsp;His gasps were coming as quickly and as hotly as Arthur&rsquo;s and they breathed into each other.&nbsp;This heightened Arthur&rsquo;s senses and pushed him over the edge, spilling into his smallclothes as Merlin jerked him roughly &ndash; at the same moment Merlin&rsquo;s red hot seed sprayed into his hand and up onto the other man&rsquo;s stomach.&nbsp;Arthur kept going until Merlin stopped bucking then relaxed and fell into his shoulder, letting all the tension flow out of him.&nbsp;Merlin held him tightly, his arms embracing him as if afraid to let go.&nbsp;Opening his eyes Arthur looked into Merlin&rsquo;s eyes and saw Lancelot&rsquo;s face once more, flushed and glowing with sweat, red marks apparent where Arthur had gnawed on cheek and neck.&nbsp;His hair was in disarray and darker from the damp, it was longer than when they had first met but Lancelot had it tied back &ndash; at some point during their love making Arthur had released it, he just couldn&rsquo;t remember doing it.</p><p>It was&hellip; strange to say the least.&nbsp;Arthur knew, without a doubt, that it was Merlin he had just been with but it had still been Lancelot&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;His sweat, his hands and his &ndash; Arthur looked down and blushed as he spied Lancelot&rsquo;s manhood, still heavy in his hand.&nbsp;Sighing to himself, both elated at what had just happened yet also worried that something about this was still a little wrong, Arthur retied Lancelot&rsquo;s breeches and leaned back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Merlin&hellip; I suppose this wasn&rsquo;t the only reason &ndash; we have strategy to discuss.&rdquo;</p><p>The laugh coming from Lancelot was definitely Merlin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;&nbsp;His eyes twinkled with a familiar mischief and Arthur guessed what was about to happen as Merlin continued.&nbsp;&ldquo;But Lancelot knows the plan so I&rsquo;ll let him tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Merlin no!&rdquo;&nbsp;Arthur inwardly cursed as the charm&rsquo;s light faded as did Merlin from Lancelot&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;The man&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, then looked down at his undone shirt and his lips thinned noticeably.&nbsp;Ever briefly he glanced down at Arthur, still showing a slight erection through his thin piece of clothing, and his anger turned to a bemused smirk.&nbsp;He released Arthur and peered at his own hands and shook his head, a half smile still evident.</p><p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Lancelot softly, as he buttoned up his shirt.&nbsp;&ldquo;That I need not call you sire any more in private.&rdquo;</p><p>Tbc&hellip;<br /><br />&nbsp;<a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/4204.html"">AshtakRa Masterfile</a><br /><br />Next: <a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/22593.html#cutid1""><strong>Chapter 9</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut>"

she queried softly and the old man smiled quickly before giving a small bow of the head.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;His mood is somewhat dark today, tis all my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;She chuckled and slowly circled him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I would say dark is the only mood he has these days.&nbsp;Perhaps someone needs remind Uther that a King must sometimes put aside personal feelings for the Kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;His mouth pulled up on one side with a smile that spoke of years of dealing with Uther Pendragon.&nbsp;&ldquo;My head will be of more use exactly where it is Morgana &ndash; but you of course are welcome to try, I think he may <i>only</i> send you to the dungeons.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;&nbsp;Morgana pressed a finger to her lips as if in contemplation.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think in this circumstance I will follow your lead&hellip; if only?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; interrupted Gaius and put a hand to her arm.&nbsp;&ldquo;But it has been almost two months, without word &ndash; Arthur could be in Jerusalem for all we know.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Morgana, her voice full of conviction that only a seer could manage.&nbsp;&ldquo;He is close, I feel it &ndash; and the dreams&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;She glanced about while pulling Gaius further from the King&rsquo;s chambers.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have never had such conflicting images Gaius.&nbsp;I see blood and tears, but at the same time joy and victory &ndash; faces of those I love in pain, but somehow it is as if I am the reason for that pain.&rdquo;&nbsp;She shook her head, the earlier playful demeanour draining away.&nbsp;&ldquo;I cannot think why but in these dreams it is I who betray them?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius pursed his lips and lifted that damned eyebrow.&nbsp;He knew exactly whom she meant by &lsquo;them&rsquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;You cannot blame yourself for something that has not happened, and will in all probability never happen &ndash; you have never been able to control your visions Morgana&hellip; of everyone you could never hurt Arthur, or Merlin for that matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana&rsquo;s eyes darkened for a moment, some hidden memory coming to the surface.&nbsp;Gaius was not to know but betrayal was not that hard when it all came down to it.&nbsp;Did she want to believe she could cause them pain?&nbsp;No.&nbsp;Was there doubt that in a moment of fury she might?</p><p>&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>&nbsp;Her eyes darted to the heavy doors, and in her mind at the man within.&nbsp;She loved Arthur, but she also loved Uther.</p><p>&nbsp;Uther had not pushed her away, if anything they had grown closer in Arthur&rsquo;s absence. &nbsp;Since Arthur&rsquo;s escape from the dungeon there had been no word, not even a smuggled letter or token to let her know he lived.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If you knew anything you would tell, wouldn&rsquo;t you Gaius?&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&nbsp;There was only the slightest hesitation. &ldquo;Of course my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;But it was enough.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>The Hills outside Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;For the second time that day Gaius found himself taken by surprise.&nbsp;At least this time it was half-expected, and somewhat welcome.&nbsp;The hooded person dressed in peasant clothes dropped from the tree and regarded Gaius from the depths of the darkened and rough cloth.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You know Arthur,&rdquo; said Gaius crisply without turning.&nbsp;&ldquo;Uther may have had me followed; his trust in me has been somewhat weakened of late.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;A snort answered him and Arthur threw back the hood.&nbsp;His hair had grown out and he sported a short beard, or more precisely a week&rsquo;s growth that the Prince somehow kept from turning into a beard.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hardly, the following I mean.&nbsp;I have been trained in tracking since birth you know, and would know if you had company.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Digging out a particularly stubborn clump of Widowsleaf Gaius stuffed it in his hip bag and finally turned to Arthur, enveloping the young man in a brief hug before fixing him with a piercing gaze.&nbsp;&ldquo;You still risk too much, perhaps in another month Uther will be more forgiving but at the moment I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past him to lock you away like some Princess in a tower.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur&rsquo;s mouth twitched in a self-depreciating smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;Princess?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Gaius, flicking Arthur&rsquo;s locks that now brushed his neckline.&nbsp;&ldquo;You have the hair for it, best be careful or the surrounding Kingdoms will send their best and finest to woo you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;This elicited a laugh and Arthur seemed to relax and sat, forcing Gaius to sit with him.&nbsp;From this hill they could just see the tip of Camelot&rsquo;s highest rampart &ndash; it was as close as Arthur was willing to come, and about as far as Gaius could travel without suspicion.&nbsp;&ldquo;What puts you in such a good mood old man?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius harrumphed loudly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly not your father and now even Morgana seems intent to make me watch every shadow.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Morgana?&rdquo;&nbsp;Arthur appeared to want to say more but shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Never mind, I asked about your cheery mood and you failed to answer &ndash; don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t noticed such word play&hellip; honestly between you and Merlin-,&rdquo; Arthur stopped as he saw Gaius&rsquo; expression change at mention of Merlin.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard from him haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Mm&hellip; what?&nbsp;Merlin is an enemy of the crown &ndash; I was lucky to keep my head for providing him shelter, do you think I would risk communication with the scoundrel?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur pursed his lips in frustration, then allowed a friendly smile to play across his features.&nbsp;&ldquo;I would believe you except for the fact you consort with me &ndash; another identified enemy of the crown&hellip; and the way you make the term <i>scoundrel</i> sound like &lsquo;beloved son&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius nodded in defeat.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well there is that.&rdquo;&nbsp;He allowed Arthur&rsquo;s brow to crease in the beginnings of anger before clapping the Prince on the shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;A pretty young lass from some village I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name of dropped me a letter &ndash; it had no names but told me the writer was fine and in good company.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have it &ndash; the letter?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius managed to look shocked.&nbsp;&ldquo;Surely it would be treason to even hold it, burning it seemed the wisest course.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What!&nbsp;Gaius, how could you?&rdquo;&nbsp;Arthur frowned as Gaius held up a folded parchment.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the old man chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;The best course would have been to never take Merlin in to my house in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Snatching the letter Arthur unfolded it and scanned the writing.&nbsp;There were indeed no names mentioned, simply a few sentences saying that he was in good health, was travelling a lot and hoped that he and his companions would be able to be more forthcoming in the near-future.&nbsp;Grunting in appreciation at Merlin&rsquo;s ability to say so much without revealing places or names Arthur returned the letter but Gaius shook his head.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Keep it; it&rsquo;s quite possible he wanted you to have it anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius did not fail to notice that Arthur did not argue and carefully folded the letter before slipping it under his shirt.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So my Knights are looking after him, that&rsquo;s good.&nbsp;Merlin would probably run into Uther&rsquo;s patrols at least twice a day without their help.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius did not answer but instead the smile slipped.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What else do you know?&rdquo; asked Arthur almost immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;Sighing Gaius waved his hand across the countryside.&nbsp;&ldquo;Rumours, tales of skirmishes with bandits and the odd sighting in taverns &ndash; they all indicate that Merlin <i>leads</i> your Knights, not the other way around.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Unable to contain his disbelief Arthur burst into laughter, the tears streaming down his cheeks.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin?&rdquo;&nbsp;He almost choked.&nbsp;&ldquo;The most useless servant in the history of the world&hellip; most likely to trip over his own shadow and&hellip; and.&rdquo;&nbsp;He shook his head as memories obviously overwhelmed him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess I just don&rsquo;t want to imagine him getting into more trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Especially if you&rsquo;re not there by his side,&rdquo; suggested Gaius.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes damnit!&rdquo;&nbsp;Arthur growled but there was no fire in his words and Gaius put an arm around him, a little shocked at how thin he had become.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur, you need to keep the faith &ndash; Merlin must have some plan or he wouldn&rsquo;t be leading your Knights across the land.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, but it should be me making those plans, and strategising&hellip; but I&rsquo;m lucky if I can organise my next day &ndash; something&rsquo;s happened Gaius, it&rsquo;s as if,&rdquo; he hesitated and slumped.&nbsp;&ldquo;Part of me is missing, I have magic now &ndash; not that I know how to use it, but when I try and remember how I used to be&hellip; its like I&rsquo;m thinking of a stranger.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius nodded sadly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think&hellip; no, I am fairly certain that in saving you Merlin twisted fate &ndash; and such things are dangerous and unpredictable.&nbsp;You are meant to be the next King, but that seems unlikely now; and Merlin, strange as it may seem&hellip; he was always meant to be by <i>your</i> side.&nbsp;Instead he is in charge of your finest warriors and does not follow anyone&rsquo;s lead but his own.&rdquo;&nbsp;Gaius prodded Arthur with his finger.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your fates are intertwined, always have been&hellip; but not like this.&nbsp;Things have to be set right.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur rolled his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, that much is obvious, but how?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Gaius.&nbsp;&ldquo;That much I have not been able to fathom.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; suggested Arthur.&nbsp;&ldquo;All we need do is switch back; now that neither of us is wounded there would be little risk.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Perhaps, but when magic is involved the matter is rarely so simple &ndash; and there is still your father to consider.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Arthur.&nbsp;&ldquo;My father.&nbsp;You know that Lord Hynd is conspiring against him.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Jarrod told me as much,&rdquo; said Gaius in response.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Good man, Jarrod.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s the reason I escaped, he found out the assassin was working for Hynd &ndash; the rest was easy to work out.&nbsp;Without an heir Uther has to appoint a successor, and Hynd is the most powerful peer next to Uther.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; argued Gaius.&nbsp;&ldquo;You lived; perhaps Hynd will not try again.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur snorted.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hardly, the man is too ambitious and if not for his rich lands and manpower Uther would have had him imprisoned long ago.&nbsp;No, I believe he will use the current situation to his advantage &ndash; I just don&rsquo;t know how&hellip; yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Jarrod is still investigating then?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;He has the King&rsquo;s ear, and can be where I cannot.&nbsp;I on the other hand can move about in Hynd&rsquo;s lands without being noticed &ndash; few there know how the crown-prince looks, and I have changed my appearance somewhat.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I noticed... the weight-loss is on purpose then?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur gave a non-committal shrug and Gaius frowned, but decided in the end not to push the issue.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Hynd builds an army,&rdquo; said Arthur, also avoiding speaking about his gauntness.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not too large but enough to be a concern &ndash; if he were to initiate a civil war, others may side with him if Uther has no heir &ndash; or if said heir is denounced as a criminal.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Uther has given orders for your capture Arthur, but he has stopped short of calling you an enemy &ndash; no matter what you think of him right now he still loves you, perhaps if you sent word, combined with news of Hynd?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Shaking his head Arthur stood.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not yet, there must be a way to stop Hynd, placate my father and fix this thing with me and Merlin.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius looked up at the prince.&nbsp;&ldquo;And what would that be?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur looked perplexed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d say this but I think it&rsquo;s all up to Merlin.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Mn,&rdquo; muttered Gaius, which matched Arthur&rsquo;s thoughts exactly.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Lake&rsquo;s End, two days ride from Camelot </u></p><p>&nbsp;The young warrior faced the last three of his opponents; their colleagues lay dead by his feet.&nbsp;They were confident but wary, he had dispatched the others quickly but not without taking wounds.&nbsp;The one on his arm was the worst, the warm trickle of blood had already reached his hand and made grip on the sword awkward.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon you cowards,&rdquo; he muttered and lowered his stance.&nbsp;The closest he would take at the knee, the second an upper-cut to the throat&hellip; the third he had not figured yet.&nbsp;As expected the first approached and the young warrior shifted his grip, at the very last moment he twisted and spun, taking the other by surprise he did indeed manage to slice his leg.&nbsp;The upper-cut to the second failed however as his arm lost its strength &ndash; too much blood loss.</p><p>&nbsp;He dropped, hoping to avoid the swing of his opponent.&nbsp;As he did the other grunted and fell back, an arrow lodged in his throat; at the same instant there was the sound of approaching hooves.&nbsp;Turning the warrior saw a black stallion approaching &ndash; apparently riderless.&nbsp;He cursed as it seemed he would be trampled today instead of run-through with a sword.&nbsp;At the very last moment the horse turned and an arm stretched out, from a body hanging out from the horse, attached only by a pair of legs to the saddle.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Without wondering who or how the young warrior grabbed the offered hand and swung up and behind him, the rider sitting upright and flinging out a hand at the remaining bandits &ndash; there was a flash and two screams that ended abruptly.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;How did you - ?&rdquo; he spoke to a shock of black hair that turned to become a face he knew all too well.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin smiled and brought the horse to a canter before pulling up so he could properly speak face-to-face.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi there Lancelot; up to no good again then?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Um?&rdquo; Lancelot had trouble speaking as half-a-dozen Knights drew up beside them &ndash; these faces too he recognised, even if he didn&rsquo;t know all the names.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last of them sir, I&rsquo;ve already dispatched a rider to let the villagers know they can return.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Excellent Bedivere, now I expect we can make camp &ndash; I for one am famished.&rdquo;&nbsp;Merlin wrinkled his nose.&nbsp;&ldquo;First we&rsquo;d better bury those bodies though, I may have overdone the fire and they&rsquo;ll stink the whole forest.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lancelot looked back over and saw two smoking remains which had been his bandits.&nbsp;He slipped off the horse and glared back up at Merlin, about to admonish him for using magic in front of Arthur&rsquo;s knights, before the stupidity of that hit him.&nbsp;Obviously the knights knew, and had absolutely no problem with it if their nonchalance attitude was anything to go by.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin&hellip; how, and why?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Throwing a leg over to face Lancelot there was a wicked gleam in Merlin&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;All in good time, first &ndash; let&rsquo;s look to those wounds.&rdquo;&nbsp;He jumped down and stared down at Lancelot, his eyes glowed and there was a tightening around Lancelot&rsquo;s larger cuts.&nbsp;&ldquo;That should do for now,&rdquo; Merlin clapped a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;Might want to clean them soon though, I doubt those blades were clean.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lancelot could barely form a coherent thought.&nbsp;This was not the Merlin he had befriended in Camelot.&nbsp;This man stood tall and stared him down.&nbsp;He spoke to knights as their lord and there was no hesitation in any of his actions.&nbsp;Even his clothes spoke of major change.&nbsp;He wore midnight blue cloth, interspaced with chain-mail and black-leather.&nbsp;The stitching was very fine and would have been expensive enough for a prince, let alone the servant of one.&nbsp;Instead of the Camelot emblem he wore an embroidered goblet on the upper-left of his chest, all in silver thread.&nbsp;He had two short-swords strapped to his back and a variety of daggers and blades around his belt and even peeking out of one boot.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin you&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Pretty fancy huh?&rdquo; grinned Merlin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Seems every time we save a village they insist on presenting us with gifts &ndash; we said no the fist few times before realising they took affront at our refusal.&nbsp;Of course,&rdquo; he winked at Lancelot.&nbsp;&ldquo;I make sure a few bags of coin find there way to several households before we leave &ndash; we&rsquo;re not mercenaries after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; shouted one knight; Lancelot was fairly certain his name was Sir Gallfoy.&nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you were kidding &lsquo;bout that, spent it on wine and whores instead.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lancelot turned to Merlin, expecting the young man to turn red or get angry.&nbsp;Instead Merlin laughed loudest and shook his finger at Gallfoy.&nbsp;&ldquo;With that pretty face I doubt you needs pay for it &ndash; and we all know half a cup of wine is enough to have you dancing the tables.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The rest of the knights laughed and Lancelot sighed; the after-effects of battle were hitting him, and combined with this all new Merlin the world was starting to spin.&nbsp;He had to put some perspective on this, find out exactly what was going on.&nbsp;The best question he could ask was obvious.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So where&rsquo;s Arthur.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The smile faded from Merlin&rsquo;s features.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; answered the young man.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now you see, this is where we need to talk.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; His arm snaked across to pull Lancelot close.&nbsp;&ldquo;Things are a little complicated, let&rsquo;s walk shall we.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;Lancelot found himself obeying without thinking about it; which in itself should have told him all he needed to know&hellip; things were bad and about to get a lot worse.</p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;<br /><br /><a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/4204.html"">AshtakRa Masterfile</a><br /><br />Next: <a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/22394.html#cutid1""><strong>Chapter 8</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;</p></lj-cut>"

it could have been the rack above a bed of hot coals.&nbsp;That is what he would be doing, but then these Camelot folk were probably too weak to use traditional torture techniques.</p><p>&nbsp;A movement at the side of his vision revealed a rather tall man dressed in black with a glint of dagger and short sword at his belt.</p><p>Weapons, that would be useful when he escaped.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ask for a name but you&rsquo;d lie and I don&rsquo;t care what your whore of a mother called you.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Henry laughed.&nbsp;His mother had been a whore and she was long dead at his own hand so such words would do little to provoke him.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; continued the man as he sat across from Henry.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like that is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;he motioned to another guard who put two goblets on the table.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Water?&rdquo;&nbsp;He proffered a goblet to Henry&rsquo;s lips, and he drank but spat it at his interrogator almost immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;This time it was the drenched man who laughed as he flicked his vest.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hence the black, it will also cover the blood when we get to that.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;As Henry watched the man brought up a bundle and unwrapped it slowly.&nbsp;Inside was an array of sharp and pointed instruments, some flat and some curved &ndash; all looked decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>&nbsp;The man smiled coldly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was trained by the best inquisitors in Rome, they were able to draw confessions from the most formidable of foes.&nbsp;My mentors were so feared even the holy father himself would avoid crossing their path&rdquo;&nbsp;He held up a tiny spiralled metal hook and grinned again.&nbsp;&ldquo;You my friend will be no challenge.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Henry winced as he imagined what it could be used for.&nbsp;His interrogator had not even asked a question yet.</p><p>&nbsp;Maybe they were good at torture after all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<u>One Level Up, Dungeons, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Stripped of jacket and regalia Arthur glared at his father through the bars.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am your son and you treat me like a common criminal.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther slammed the bars.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hardly common but by the gods you act like one.&nbsp;You think you could deceive me with a simple parlour trick?&nbsp;That servant of yours is alive and until you admit your betrayal and tell me his location you will remain here.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur sat down on the cold stone floor and leaned against the wall.&nbsp;&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d best get comfortable.&rdquo;&nbsp;He gave Uther his best smile and was pleased to see the anger build.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You-are-unbelievable Arthur, what have I done to deserve treachery from my own flesh and blood?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther started pacing up and down in front of the cell, his gloved hands waving about in frustration.&nbsp;&ldquo;Ever since <i>Merlin</i> came here you have been impossible.&nbsp;You argue with me all the time, disagree with my decisions and disobey me time and time again&hellip; and now this!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur chuckled and let his head fall against the wall.&nbsp;&ldquo;You <i>finally</i> said his name, I think you&rsquo;re growing soft father.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther stopped and glared at Arthur for almost a minute before talking.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will find him and he will be tried and executed as a sorcerer.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur opened his hands in exasperation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hence our deceit &ndash; I was not about to let him burn.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So arrogant,&rdquo; muttered Uther.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yet you have no idea.&nbsp;Morgana had almost convinced me to spare Merlin, for sure he would have been exiled but I was considering letting him live &ndash; he did after all save the life of my son.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur&rsquo;s mouth dropped open.&nbsp;&ldquo;But?&nbsp;Surely then we can work this out?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Walking closer to the bars the shadows fell across Uther&rsquo;s face and gave him an otherworldly appearance.&nbsp;&ldquo;No Arthur, now I can see how he would infect you.&nbsp;He has wiled his way into your affections, no doubt your bed and you, weak and spineless, you would be led to betray your very own family &ndash; for that he will die.&rdquo;&nbsp;Uther stepped back as Arthur jumped up and rattled the bars in anger.&nbsp;&ldquo;And sending your knights to protect him was a good idea&hellip; but they are not all <i>your</i> knights.&rdquo;&nbsp;Uther smiled without it reaching his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to know where they are because Merlin will be dead before the sun rises, and his body&hellip; his real body this time, will be dragged through the streets as a lesson to all.&rdquo;&nbsp;Uther paused for the coups de gras.&nbsp;&ldquo;And to follow that your knights will be flogged for aiding a sorcerer.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He walked away as Arthur pressed his face against the bars and shouted in anger and frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Deep beneath the dungeons the dragon heard his shouts and growled in annoyance; something had changed and the elemental creature could not work out what.&nbsp;He needed to speak with Merlin but the boy was beyond his detection.</p><p>&nbsp;Perhaps it was time to finally open a dialogue with Arthur &ndash; it was inevitable in any event.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Three hours north of Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Merlin winced at another jolt from the horse and sighed in resignation.&nbsp;If they stopped death was certain if Uther found them, so a little pain now was better than burning later.&nbsp;One of Gaius&rsquo; concoctions would have been good but he and Arthur had not dared to ask his help &ndash; he would be in a difficult situation as it were and Merlin hoped he did not get sent to the block.</p><p>&nbsp;Something tingled at the back of his mind; as if someone had brushed his neck from the inside.&nbsp;Something magical was searching for him.</p><p>&nbsp;The dragon?</p><p>&nbsp;No, he knew the touch of that creature, this was different &ndash; more intimate and yet uncertain.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur!&rdquo; he hissed and suddenly stopped to turn and look behind them.</p><p>&nbsp;It saved his life.</p><p>&nbsp;A black shape flew by his face, he felt the wind of it and it took a moment to register.</p><p>&nbsp;Some of the knights were faster to notice the danger.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Form up!&rdquo; shouted Sir Bedivere.&nbsp;The group reacted instantly and while they turned to face the forest Merlin found himself in the middle of their huddle.</p><p>&nbsp;They were protecting him with their lives and for Merlin this was ridiculous.</p><p>&nbsp;More arrows shots past and Merlin tried to discern where they were coming from &ndash; but the night was too dark.</p><p>&nbsp;Not for long.</p><p>&nbsp;With a few whispered words a great ball of light shot into the sky and they could see their foe.&nbsp;About a dozen mounted archers had flanked them, there were no foot-soldiers.</p><p>&nbsp;Beside him Gallfoy grunted as an arrow lodged in his shoulder, even in pain the man turned to shield Merlin as more arrows flew in.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Draw swords,&rdquo; said Bedivere calmly and the knights obeyed.&nbsp;Merlin knew they would charge the archers and probably succeed &ndash; but not without loss.</p><p>What would Arthur do?</p><p>&nbsp;He wouldn&rsquo;t think, thought Merlin, he would simply act.</p><p>&nbsp;Spurring his horse Merlin trotted forth to put himself between the archers and his protectors, before any knights could interfere Merlin put an arm out and whispered a hasty incantation.</p><p>&nbsp;Time slowed down and the arrows travelled like snails through the air.&nbsp;The knights, not affected by Merlin&rsquo;s spell, did not hesitate and charged past Merlin to take down their attackers.&nbsp;Gallfoy and Haddon stayed to flank Merlin.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; whispered Merlin as he turned to Gallfoy.&nbsp;With shock he saw the man swing his sword at him.</p><p>&nbsp;Frozen to the spot Merlin could not even think of something to stop him, all he could consider was that the world was getting more and more crazy.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Dungeons, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Smoothing down his tunic Jarrod passed the bundle to a waiting guard.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Please return that to Lady Morgana&rsquo;s handmaiden, tell her I didn&rsquo;t need its use after all.&rdquo;&nbsp;At the puzzled look Jarrod shook his head.&nbsp;&ldquo;Best not to know my friend, women have more instruments of torture in one bedchamber than in the entire of Camelot&rsquo;s dungeons.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The guard left and Jarrod made his way slowly along the cells.&nbsp;The information from Henry, as the man had claimed his name was, was sparse but not entirely useless &ndash; in the right hands.&nbsp;Uther would expect a report but first Jarrod had to check on a few things.&nbsp;In his ponderings he barely noticed the guards he passed but was surprised to come to a cell where the crown prince sat inside the dimly lit room.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Sire?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur looked up and gave a grunt.&nbsp;&ldquo;Guardsman Jarrod, here to implement the king&rsquo;s justice?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&nbsp;I&rsquo;m just&hellip; oh!&rdquo;&nbsp;Looking down at his outfit Jarrod realised what Arthur must be thinking.&nbsp;The tight black material with leather panels probably did give the wrong impression &ndash; well it had given the right impression for Henry and that combined with Gwen&rsquo;s manicure set had meant he never needed to draw a drop of blood.&nbsp;The threat had proven more effective than the follow-through.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Forgive me my Lord, this was for someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Lucky them,&rdquo; smirked Arthur with what Jarrod could only describe as a leer.&nbsp;Had he just been flirted with by the son of the king?</p><p>&nbsp;Crouching and lowering his voice Jarrod tried to change the subject.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know not why you are here my lord, but I have grave news concerning your assassin.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur shook his head in confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;Here I am, under guard in probably the worst smelling cell and not only do you still treat me with respect but you seem to think I would care why yet another person wanted me dead &ndash; anyone else would of at least taken the chance to mock me.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave a hollow laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yesterday I was the second most powerful man in the kingdom, today I rot&hellip; and the most ridiculous thing is I am here by choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;This time Jarrod frowned.&nbsp;&ldquo;My lord, the measure of a man is not how far he can fall, but how soon he picks himself back up.&rdquo;&nbsp;He then smiled, revealing to Arthur that he knew his situation better than most.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our beliefs can get us killed but they can never destroy us &ndash; the fiercest warrior in all Camelot could no doubt escape his cell if he so wished, but what would it achieve?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur gave him a quizzical look.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am talking of redemption sire &ndash; if you need a reason I have found one.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Arthur softly, his interest was raised.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There is only one man who could put you here,&rdquo; explained Jarrod.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I am giving you the chance to save his life, if you wish it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur sighed.&nbsp;Truth was he could have blown apart the bars with Merlin&rsquo;s magic, or was it his now?&nbsp;He should have, Merlin and his knights were in danger.&nbsp;What stopped him was duty, and trust.&nbsp;He had to trust that his knights could protect both themselves and Merlin &ndash; even if one of them was Uther&rsquo;s.&nbsp;his duty was to Camelot &ndash; if the crown prince escaped and was to be hunted it could spark a civil war.</p><p>&nbsp;He hated his father right now but Uther&rsquo;s death, while Arthur was proclaimed a criminal, would be even more catastrophic.&nbsp;Rival kingdoms would most likely invade to take advantage of the power vacuum.&nbsp;Hundreds, maybe even thousands, would die.</p><p>&nbsp;It was never easy.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me&rdquo; he ordered, and Jarrod did.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Three hours north of Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;The sword came swinging down and Merlin felt the fear clench at every organ in his body, freezing him in place.&nbsp;He saw Gallfoy's face, twisted in anger and strangely, surprise.&nbsp;The reason for this was soon revealed as the blade missed Merlin and swept by, to connect loudly with another blade.&nbsp;This one would have decapitated Merlin and was wielded by Sir Haddon.</p><p>&nbsp;Freed from his momentary lapse of non-action Merlin leaned back and tugged on the reigns.&nbsp;His steed, being a warhorse, responded as if there were not two knights locked in a fierce duel over his back.&nbsp;Without having to worry about Merlin in the way Gallfoy doubled his efforts, forcing Haddon to defend.&nbsp;Even though wounded it was Gallfoy the better warrior and without Merlin having to help Haddon was sliced across the neck and he fell from the horse.&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Merlin leapt down to him and studied the wound, it was bleeding freely and too deep to stop without Gaius' instruments, but he plugged it with his hand anyway.&nbsp;The man had been trying to kill him but Merlin felt a pang of regret &ndash; prior to this he had always been a man of honour and one of Arthur's closest friends.&nbsp;Gallfoy joined them and held a hand tightly over Merlin's to increase the pressure, he glanced at Merlin and screwed his face up in sorrow.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&quot;Damnable fool,&quot; muttered Gallfoy.&nbsp;&quot;He has always been guilty of dropping his guard, I was aiming at his shoulder but the horse jumped.&quot;&nbsp;He shook his head and looked into Haddon's eyes, which were widening now as the man realised his death was close at hand.&nbsp;&quot;Why Joseph?&nbsp;Why did you do this?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;Haddon gave a smile, it seemed not one of anger or remorse but acceptance.&nbsp;&quot;I am glad it was you my friend,&quot; his voice was weak but clear, the wound had not penetrated his windpipe.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Killing Merlin,&quot; he continued.&nbsp;&quot;It seemed wrong to me but Uther's policies are clear &ndash; and he is my king.&quot;</span></p><p>&nbsp;&quot;Oh Joseph,&quot; whispered Gallfoy, stroking the other man's temple with his other hand.&nbsp;&quot;Have you forgotten that blind obedience breeds only stupidity &ndash; you should have trusted Arthur, you should have trusted us.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;The dying man smiled again, a cheeky glint in them this time.&nbsp;&quot;For the honour of my family I did this, but I always trusted you to stop me.&quot;&nbsp;His eyes rolled to Merlin.&nbsp;&quot;You are a very dangerous young man, part of me hoped to succeed but the other&hellip;&quot;&nbsp;he shrugged, gave a last smile and died.</p><p>&nbsp;Gallfoy bowed his head and Merlin watched a tear run down his face.&nbsp;Together they removed their hands from Haddon's neck and Merlin placed his clean hand on Gallfoy's shoulder, infusing it with a touch of magic to help with his pain from the arrow &ndash; for the pain of losing his friend Merlin could do nothing.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said anyway.&nbsp;&quot;What did he mean &ndash; he trusted you to stop him?&quot;</span></p><p>&nbsp;Gallfoy wiped the tears away and straightened, looking down at the arrow in his shoulder as if surprised it was there.&nbsp;&quot;He hesitated, had he not I would not have been able to stop his blow &ndash; you would be dead Merlin.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;Biting his lip Merlin pondered this and thought it better to say nothing.&nbsp;Gallfoy had saved his life, but at the expense of his best friend &ndash; he would not want to discuss this anytime soon.&nbsp;The other knights had finished off the attackers and Bedivere walked over slowly, also placing a hand on Gallfoy's shoulder but he looked at Merlin while spoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;This at least explains how they tracked us, Haddon must have left a trail.&nbsp;He was a good man, he fought by my side last winter and took an axe to the thigh &ndash; I would have thought that of us all he was most loyal to Arthur.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;And he probably still was,&quot; growled Merlin, having had enough.&nbsp;&quot;It was me he tried to kill, not Arthur!&quot;&nbsp;He walked over to his saddle bags and removed some cloth and water.&nbsp;&quot;I am just a servant, a peasant and a sorcerer &ndash; there was no need for him to protect me and betray his king.&quot;&nbsp;He lay out the cloth and tore open Gallfoy's shirt, revealing the imbedded arrow-head.&nbsp;Washing it with the water he continued his argument to the strangely silent knights.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Arthur may have asked you to escort me from Camelot, and I appreciate your help, but it is ridiculous for you to put your lives at risk for mine.&quot;&nbsp;Pressing around the shaft he surmised it was not barbed and gripped the arrow firmly.&nbsp;&quot;Hold him!&quot;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bedivere held Gallfoy and the injured knight gritted his teeth, knowing what was coming.&nbsp;The arrow came out cleanly but the wound bled quicker than Merlin had expected.&nbsp;&quot;This is going to hurt I'm afraid,&quot; he said and with a whispered word the wound smoked then cauterised without the help of instruments.&nbsp;To Gallfoy&rsquo;s credit a muttered curse was all he did to indicate the pain.</span></p><p>&nbsp;Cleaning the rest of Gallfoy&rsquo;s now closed wound and shoulder Merlin took a chance to look at the surrounding knights.&nbsp;They looked to him, not in fear and certainly not in anger &ndash; their expressions were something he had never seen directed from nobles to himself.</p><p>&nbsp;Expectation.</p><p>&nbsp;They were waiting for orders, from him.&nbsp;He had seen them look to Arthur in exactly the same way and snorted at the absurdity of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This is insane, you cannot believe this is okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t direct the comment at anyone in particular but it was Bedivere who spoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I answer for us all when I say it is definitely unusual &ndash; but somehow right.&nbsp;You may be called a servant, and have humble beginnings&hellip; but there is something about you requires our&hellip;&rdquo; he struggled for the correct wording.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dedication.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur is our lord and master, but you Merlin &ndash; I cannot help thinking there is no Arthur without his Merlin.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;Several knights muttered their agreement and Merlin took a minute to clean his hands and walk to where the bodies of the archers had fallen.&nbsp;They were men of Camelot, soldiers who had also died because of him.&nbsp;Is this what Arthur felt every time he went to battle &ndash; the guilt but also the knowledge that events were as they had to be.&nbsp;People would die, both because of him and at his own hands &ndash; yet how many more would die if he did nothing?</p><p>&nbsp;Turning back to the waiting knights Merlin shifted and stood tall, he usually bent a little around nobles since he was taller and they hated it &ndash; normally.&nbsp;In the moonlight his shadow fell across the body of Sir Haddon, a grim reminder of what awaited them all if they failed.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Uther is still your King,&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp;&ldquo;I do not want that changed, I am not suggesting a civil war&hellip; but Arthur may be in danger &ndash; he needs our help and running away will achieve nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He bent down and collected Haddon&rsquo;s sword, holding it up to glint in the moonlight there was something he knew he was missing about all this.&nbsp;He with the knights of Camelot, Arthur with magic and undefended in the city &ndash; events were unfolding that were twisting fate in different directions.&nbsp;If Merlin was right getting back to Camelot would be a lot harder than leaving it &ndash; and that meant they would need help.</p><p>&nbsp;Putting the sword through his belt he jumped onto the horse one knight held for him and swung his mount around to face the others.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you wish to follow me then know that everything I do is for Arthur &ndash; all else is secondary, even my life and yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;He was met with tight nods, agreement among equals.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Then we ride,&rdquo; he said loudly.&nbsp;&ldquo;There are a few people I need to see; enemies of the crown, magic folk and most unsavoury sorts.&rdquo;&nbsp;He smiled as a few knights chuckled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I know the irony &ndash; let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;<br /><br /><a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/4204.html"">AshtakRa Masterfile</a><br /><br /><br />Next: <a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/22122.html"">Chapter 7</a></p></lj-cut><br />"

smiled Merlin, his eyes flashing gold.</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur stared at him and shook his head again, this time more at himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;How is it that I never noticed?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Self-obsessed probably.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Cheeky.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Its what I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We have to get you out of here,&rdquo; said Arthur growing serious.</p><p>&nbsp;Shrugging on a shirt Merlin winced only slightly and marvelled that he could move at all.&nbsp;He was lucky to be alive let alone able to move.&nbsp;He&rsquo;d like to think that Gaius was just that good but something else was going on if he could heal this fast.&nbsp;Speaking of things going on.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We also have to talk about what you did &ndash; sorcery in the royal household will not be easy to hide.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur was rifling through some of Gaius&rsquo; bottles, for what Merlin had no idea.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know better than most I guess.&rdquo;&nbsp;There was recrimination in his voice.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur&hellip; I should have told you long ago &ndash; there was just never a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Hands closed on his shoulders and he was facing Arthur&rsquo;s eyes again.&nbsp;&ldquo;Communication&rsquo;s not our strong point Merlin, I&rsquo;ve wanted to kiss you since we met but never had the courage.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He really knew he shouldn&rsquo;t but Merlin snorted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, did Prince Arthur just admit to being afraid of something.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Your injuries have addled your brain, I said no such thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Prove it, kiss me again.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He did, stronger and longer this time and it left Merlin a little light headed.&nbsp;So much so that he only came back to reality when Arthur was holding up a vial full of something that looked like blood.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;My father will come to check on things himself&nbsp;- and he will not fall for you hiding under a sheet.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you suggest then <i>my prince</i>,&rdquo; said Merlin with a grin.</p><p>&nbsp;Holding back a laugh Arthur shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;That depends, just how good a sorcerer are you Merlin?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Gaius&rsquo; Chambers, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Arthur was once again covered in blood and looked at Uther with tears in his eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;He thought it was me on the table, and got in a deep cut before being stopped&hellip; Merlin died in my arms father, saving my life yet again.&rdquo;&nbsp;He hid his face, not daring to look at Uther in the eyes, afraid his father would spot the lie.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And the assassin?&rdquo; Uther spoke as he turned away from his grieving son.</p><p>&nbsp;Sir Bedivere stepped forward.&nbsp;&ldquo;Alive sire, he has been taken to the dungeons for questioning.&rdquo;&nbsp;Out of the King&rsquo;s vision the knight looked to Arthur who nodded slightly and Sir Bedivere left the room with a distinct limp, his red cloak billowing in the draft.</p><p>&nbsp;Uther looked back at Arthur questioningly.&nbsp;Arthur understood.&nbsp;&ldquo;Bedivere would never boast sire but he was the one who caught the assassin, it was not without injury I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;As they now the only ones left Uther sighed and walked over to his son, placing a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;Arthur was still standing by the table with a hand on the blood soaked sheet covering the prone body.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur, please believe that I take no pleasure in your servant&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;He was more than my servant father, Merlin was my friend,&rdquo; said Arthur quickly.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am sure it felt that way&hellip; but as prince many will pretend to be a friend &ndash; when really it is treachery they plan.&nbsp;Your manservant was hiding his magic from you, would a friend do such a thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;He would if knowing brought me to conflict with my own father.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther took a step back.&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur, you know the law &ndash; no matter the boy&rsquo;s intentions he was deceiving you to save only himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur breathed slowly and brought up his bloodied hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;It would seem he failed.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther shook his head and said nothing, instead he pulled the sheet back and stared at Merlin&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;Pulling the cloth down further revealed a chest half covered in Gaius&rsquo; bandages for the original wound and a neat open cut near his heart.&nbsp;&ldquo;Say your goodbyes son, the body will be burnt immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur blanched.&nbsp;&ldquo;Father!&nbsp;Merlin deserves better than that; he should be taken back to his mother-.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; thundered Uther.&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know sorcerers like I do, they are only safe when turned to ash.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur swallowed and looked from Merlin to Uther.&nbsp;&ldquo;You would have executed him anyway, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter now,&rdquo; Uther said softly.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Answer me,&rdquo; demanded Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;Uther&rsquo;s face grew dark.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to whom you speak.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Of that you need not fear,&rdquo; spat Arthur.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Clean yourself up and act like a prince of Camelot,&rdquo; ordered Uther as he marched to the door.&nbsp;&ldquo;I did not raise a son who acts like a spoiled brat and throws a tantrum because he lost a playmate &ndash; accept his death and move on.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;He had a name father, and you have not said it once.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther sneered.&nbsp;&ldquo;A name that will be long forgotten when ours will endure.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;<u>By the North Gate, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;The guard nodded at Sir Bedivere as the knight walked towards the gate.&nbsp;It was unusual that he was on foot but then questioning a noble without good cause would earn a quick trip to the stocks.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when said knight was limping and probably in poor spirits.</span></p><p>&nbsp;Watching the knight exit and disappear into the darkness the guard jumped when a minute later he heard horses approaching and made way for yet more knights.&nbsp;Half-a-dozen of them and all wore the red of Camelot, more specifically the dragon crest with sword and cudgel that designated them cohorts of Prince Arthur.&nbsp;The guard bowed his head respectfully but kept an eye on them.&nbsp;It was a little strange that given the recent events, of which no-one could provide a clear story, that the knights would be leaving without their prince.</p><p>&nbsp;Still, he was here to question people entering and prevent an assassin leaving &ndash; not hold up the higher echelons of Camelot society.&nbsp;His respectful demeanour almost cracked when for a second he thought he saw a familiar figure amongst their number&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;Sir Bedivere.</p><p>&nbsp;Once they had passed the guard nodded at his partner and moved off.&nbsp;He needed to speak with a superior immediately, if he was wrong he would be rebuffed and possibly sent to the stocks &ndash; but if he was right and said nothing?&nbsp;If that happened the stocks would be a welcome alternative.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>The Great Court, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Uther watched the pyre catch alight and looked sideways at his son.&nbsp;Arthur had indeed cleaned himself up and stood wearing his proper court regalia, red jacket with dragon pendent and black breeches.&nbsp;The prince&rsquo;s crown sat on his head above an impassive face.</p><p>&nbsp;Nodding to himself Uther regretted being hard on his son, but knew it necessary.&nbsp;How many so called friends had he sent to the fire?&nbsp;Too many, especially in the first few months of the purge and countless more since.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrible but necessary, such was the lot of being king.</span></p><p>&nbsp;The body, wrapped in a white sheet was thrown on the burning stack and quickly caught alight.&nbsp;Uther had accompanied the body himself, a niggling thought at the back of his mind told him to beware of treachery.&nbsp;Only once the fire enveloped the white bundle did he allow himself to breath.</p><p>&nbsp;It was over.</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur would hate him for awhile and there would be troublesome talk of easing the magic laws &ndash; but it would all die down soon enough and life would return to some semblance of normality.</p><p>&nbsp;It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to at least show Arthur some empathy though.&nbsp;Uther moved over to his son and put an arm around his shoulders &ndash; in the harsh light of the fire it was hard to see Arthur&rsquo;s face but it seemed like a smile had graced his features.&nbsp;Perhaps, thought Uther, forgiveness would not be too long in coming.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur I - .&rdquo;&nbsp;He stopped himself as a gust of smoke blew their way and entered his nostrils.&nbsp;Uther had been present at enough burnings to know the distinct tang of burning human flesh &ndash; and had hosted enough banquets to know roasting pig.</p><p>&nbsp;His fist curled in Arthur&rsquo;s jacket and his lips curled in anger but Uther resisted saying anything &ndash; now was not the time, not in front of the court.&nbsp;Arthur looked to him and saw his expression and whatever smile of victory Arthur had been wearing faded away as he realised Uther knew.</p><p>&nbsp;Uther let a cold smile grace his own face as Arthur&rsquo;s grew more uncomfortable.</p><p>&nbsp;It seems the treachery was closer than he had thought.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>One Mile from North Gate, outside Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Merlin let the glammer fade and slumped down to the ground.&nbsp;Walking this far had drained him and if the dampness on his shirt meant anything, re-opened some of Gaius&rsquo; stitches.&nbsp;He pulled the red cloak close to try and keep out the cold evening air and risked a look back at the city.&nbsp;From here it was just a few sparkling lights in the upper battlements, the rest seemed in mourning although Merlin could not guess what for.</p><p>&nbsp;Their prince was alive and the evil sorcerer dead.&nbsp;He chuckled at the thought of that.&nbsp;Him an evil sorcerer?&nbsp;Merlin had enough trouble picturing himself as a sorcerer, let alone evil.&nbsp;Sure he had magic and had managed a few, admittedly awesome, spells but being evil would be too hard.&nbsp;All that planning and plotting, and he had never managed the cackling laughter &ndash; he had tried but failed miserbly.</p><p>&nbsp;As a particularly icy wind buffeted him he considered lighting a fire but the energy needed to gather wood and then light it &ndash; maybe he should lie down and sleep a little first.&nbsp;They had little time to organise this before Uther had arrived, as Arthur guessed he would.&nbsp;Although never having actually tried a glammer, let alone two and one at a great distance the desperate need seemed to have spurred his powers, as it usually did.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The concern for Merlin had been if he still could use magic, since at first it seemed Arthur may have stolen it.&nbsp;Steal might not be accurate but something had happened when they switched places; Arthur could conjure magic and Merlin could hold an assassin at bay with one arm and a chest wound &ndash; both of these things impossible before the &lsquo;great body swap&rsquo; as Merlin was now referring to it inside his head.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; There had also been no time for he and Arthur to discuss it, except for some puzzled glances and that was when they weren&rsquo;t groping each other.&nbsp;Smiling at the memory Merlin hoped they would not be separated for too long.&nbsp;They&rsquo;d started something that definitely needed finishing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;Galloping horses interrupted his thoughts and he looked up to see half-a-dozen dark figures come to a stop above him.&nbsp;One dismounted immediately and strode to Merlin, seeing it was Bedivere Merlin went to return the cloak but the knight stayed his hand and instead brought out another thicker one and threw it around Merlin&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Easy Merlin, we&rsquo;ll take it from here.&rdquo;&nbsp;Bedivere patted his shoulder and turned to the other knights.&nbsp;&ldquo;Build a fire, we have a long ride and it is a cold evening &ndash; we have an hour, maybe more if they fall for the false tracks we just left.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;In a very short time a small bundle of wood was ready as they formed a semi-circle around it.&nbsp;It must have rained earlier for Gallfoy had trouble getting a spark to catch.&nbsp;Merlin sighed and raised his hand &ndash; its not as if anyone here did not now know he had magic, he clicked his fingers and the wood burst into flames.</p><p>&nbsp;Gallfoy cursed and jumped back, turning to glare at Merlin who stopped smirking, worried that maybe he had misjudged Arthur&rsquo;s knights as they all put their hands to swords.&nbsp;Sure they had agreed to escort Merlin to safety but he&rsquo;d never inquired as to their exact loyalties where magic was concerned.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Merlin muttered.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just thought, I mean it seemed you needed a little help and I knew I could&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;His voice trailed off as six sets of eyes stared blankly at him.</p><p>&nbsp;Before one bark of laughter shot out and then they were all smiling and laughing, except for Merlin who scowled even more.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said loudly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I could turn you all into toads.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;That just made them laugh louder and Gallfoy, who had sat next to him nudged Merlin lightly.&nbsp;&ldquo;For some of us that would be an improvement my Lor- Merlin,&rdquo; he corrected himself but did not seem to notice his mistake.</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin grinned to show his gratitude at their good humour but inside his thoughts were turning yet again.&nbsp;Before yesterday the knights were friendly to him, but only as much as nobility to servant could be.&nbsp;Perhaps as Arthur&rsquo;s manservant he did receive a little more, not respect exactly, but tolerance.&nbsp;Now it was as if they had embraced him as one of their own, even elevated him.</p><p>&nbsp;It couldn&rsquo;t just be the magic, these men had been brought up to fear and hate such things.&nbsp;A nasty possibility began to worm its way into his head and Merlin stopped smiling.&nbsp;If what he was considering were even partly true then Arthur was not as safe in Camelot as they had thought.</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur had magic and Merlin had the protection of Camelot&rsquo;s knights.</p><p>&nbsp;The world was turning upside down.</p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;<br /><br /><a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/4204.html"">AshtakRa Masterfile</a></p></lj-cut><br />"

Chambers, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Arthur ran to Merlin&rsquo;s side, fear lighting his eyes &ndash; not something Merlin was used to seeing in the Prince.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;How did I -?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;How did you -?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;They spoke over each other and grinned at the absurdity of it.&nbsp;Any further discussion was halted as there was a banging on the main door.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Open this door, in the name of the King!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Crap.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Language Merlin.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Speak for yourself my <i>lord</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur gave Merlin an exasperated look, one which he hoped also conveyed how pleased he was that Merlin that up and talking.&nbsp;Not that he would voice such relief.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly Merlin, <em>can </em>you be quiet or are you incapable of even one ounce of self-preservation?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin narrowed his eyes as the door was thumped on yet again.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was hoping that perhaps, as a famous warrior that you yourself have boasted as such to a legion of admiring&hellip; admirers, the great and mighty Arthur of Camelot would come up with some successful strategy instead of berating his poor manservant, who might I add saved said Arthur not that long ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Across the room Sir <span>Bedivere snorted a laugh while keeping a sword on the downed assassin.&nbsp;Arthur spared him a glare before putting his finger to Merlin&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;&ldquo;By the gods Merlin, even with one lung you can&rsquo;t shut-up &ndash; I have a plan but you really need to be-very-quiet, in fact <i>deathly</i> quiet, if you get my meaning.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;Behind the finger Merlin raised his eyebrows in sudden comprehension and grinned mischievously before lying back down as Arthur threw the blanket over his head.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Idiot,&rdquo; muttered Arthur as he turned to face the door.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Prat,&rdquo; answered the &lsquo;corpse&rsquo;.</p><p>&nbsp;Beneath the blanket Merlin could see the sudden extra light as the main door opened and multiple footsteps entered the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Inform the king,&rdquo; a voice called.&nbsp;More footsteps, leaving if Merlin was correct and then the door closed.&nbsp;Another lamp was lit and Merlin could see a lot clearer through the blanket&rsquo;s weaving.</p><p>&nbsp;The only extra person was a tall man, dressed in Camelot livery who walked over to face Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Guardsman Jarrod my Lord, I was tracking this man when a body was found a street over, turned out to be a pig wrapped in a cloak.&rdquo;&nbsp;He moved over to the assassin&rsquo;s body and nodded at Sir <span>Bedivere who withdrew his sword.&nbsp;Jarrod put his hand on the assassin&rsquo;s neck for a few seconds, much as Merlin had seen Gaius do countless times.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive, but barely.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jarrod returned to Arthur but glanced surreptitiously at Merlin.&nbsp;He was unlike any guardsman Merlin had met.&nbsp;For starters he appeared quite healthy and his height spoke of an upbringing free of starvation, not to mention his face was darkly handsome and reminded Merlin a little of Lancelot.&nbsp;His demeanour was strange as well, while showing Arthur the proper respect he seemed more interested in getting things done than worrying about etiquette.&nbsp;If Merlin were honest he saw a little of himself in Guardsman Jarrod.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;A decoy placed so close to where the original target was&nbsp;staying could&nbsp;not have been a coincidence so I came straight over &ndash; I do apologise for our entrance.&rdquo;&nbsp;Merlin knew that Jarrod was addressing Arthur but his eyes stayed on Merlin and were regarding him strangely.&nbsp;As a precaution Merlin held his breath, but found that painful so kept his breathing shallow.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite alright Guardsman,&rdquo; Arthur said with a small cough.&nbsp;&ldquo;It would seem the matter was taken care of in any event.&rdquo;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t elaborate and Jarrod just raised an eyebrow, the man obviously wanted to know more but knew better than to question the crown prince.&nbsp;Arthur suddenly frowned.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you just refer to me as &lsquo;the target&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well you certainly weren&rsquo;t a bystander,&rdquo; answered Jarrod before catching himself and giving an apologetic grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry my Lord, in Rome we tried to avoid using titles during an investigation &ndash; made our lines of inquiry less&hellip; political.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur dismissed his earlier comment with a wave, its not as if after Merlin he wasn&rsquo;t used to people speaking out of turn in front of him.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ve</i> been to Rome?&rdquo; he asked instead and with a little bit of disbelief.</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin wanted to hiss, knowing that Arthur would not understand that his tone was insulting to Jarrod.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Um, yes sire,&rdquo; said Jarrod with a quick smile and Merlin almost groaned, he was convinced this Guardsman knew exactly what was going on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur looked over at Merlin.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am afraid we were all too late, the assassin did indeed strike again, he managed to kill my manservant.&rdquo;&nbsp;He said it so flippantly that Merlin almost snorted.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will truly mourn him, worst servant in the history of Albion, with a simple mind that could never grasp even the basics of etiquette, but his foolish ways always made me laugh.&rdquo;&nbsp;At this Arthur grabbed Merlin&rsquo;s foot and squeezed rather painfully.&nbsp;&ldquo;Still, he is easily replaced and the murderer is found, so all&rsquo;s well in the end eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course my lord,&rdquo; answered Jarrod, who when Arthur wasn&rsquo;t facing him looked straight at Merlin and rolled his eyes.&nbsp;It took all of Merlin&rsquo;s will power to not laugh.</p><p>&nbsp;Jarrod then coughed nervously when Arthur turned back to him but spoke clearly.&nbsp;&ldquo;None-the-less, may I offer my condolences sire, I will let the King know of your servant&rsquo;s demise and let me assure you that I will handle the interrogation of the prisoner personally.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you Guardsman, I would appreciate you informing me of the outcome.&nbsp;The assassin may have missed tonight but whoever sent him may try again &ndash; and I fear he may strike a more <em>valuable </em><i>target</i> next time.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Jarrod smiled at the prince&rsquo;s jibe and opened the door so that others could enter and remove the assassin.&nbsp;Once they were all gone and <span>Bedivere had checked the door Merlin threw off the blanket, rather painfully, and glared at Arthur.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Simple?&nbsp;Foolish?&nbsp;<i>Easily</i> replaced?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur held his heart in mock surprise.&nbsp;&ldquo;It lives!&nbsp;The gods have a sense of humour after-all.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Bedivere softly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will wait outside, when the area is clear we can move.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you Bedivere,&rdquo; replied Arthur without turning.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;What Arthur did not notice but what confused Merlin was Bedivere had been looking straight at Merlin when he said lord.</p><p>&nbsp;His confusion was interrupted as soon as the door closed and Arthur was suddenly upon him, encasing him in the hardest hug he had ever endured.&nbsp;Since he was naked from the waist up he could feel the texture of Arthur&rsquo;s clothes and his hard muscle beneath.&nbsp;Powerful biceps closed around his shoulders and his face was thrust into the small of Arthur&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp;For the first time in a long time he felt protected.</p><p>&nbsp;He allowed himself to relax and enjoy the closeness, something he had desired but not truly thought possible &ndash; of course Arthur was only hugging him, nothing more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur released him and Merlin was about to lament the loss when lips were suddenly pressed against his own.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; It took him some moments to respond, but he finally did by opening his mouth and letting Arthur&rsquo;s tongue slide inside.&nbsp;The kiss deepened and it was like some spark had ignited something between them.&nbsp;The hairs on Merlin&rsquo;s arms stood up straight and a warm glow infused him, Arthur too by the feel of it.&nbsp;The prince sucked on Merlin&rsquo;s lower lip before pulling back to look straight into Merlin&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; squeaked Merlin.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgiven.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;</p><a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/4204.html"">AshtakRa Masterfile</a></lj-cut><p><br />&nbsp;</p>"

Chambers, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Throwing his soiled clothes in a heap Arthur washed himself down with the help of a cold bucket of water that had probably been sitting there for days.&nbsp;It crossed his mind to call for hot water but who would prepare it?&nbsp;Gwen would probably do it but that was hardly fair, he&rsquo;d only just asked her to treat him as an equal and <i>not</i> a Prince.&nbsp;Gaius was busy and his knights would probably just give him one of <i>those</i> looks.&nbsp;Then there was Merlin.&nbsp;Merlin who even if he was fit and able would take too long and either get the temperature too hot or barely warm.&nbsp;Merlin who would slosh the water all over the floor, forget to have a towel waiting and be too skittish to help him bathe.</p><p>&nbsp;This thought made Arthur&rsquo;s brow knit in frustration.&nbsp;He had grown up being served by a literal army of men and women and not one had ever baulked at dressing him, bathing him or seeing him in all states of dress and undress.&nbsp;It was not something he had given much thought to; he was their prince and he supposed to them it was a job, a task.&nbsp;Had a maid ever given him an appraising look?&nbsp;Had a stableman ever let his eyes wander on him more than was appropriate?&nbsp;Yes to both, and Arthur had, on occasion, taken advantage of such admirers.&nbsp;But for each and every one they knew that it was nothing more than a bit of fun; no future in it and certainly no need for hesitation or awkwardness around the princely person.</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin had been obnoxious and sometimes outright belligerent and now when Arthur thought about it quite a dithering klutz especially when they were alone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<i>I love you Arthur Pendragon</i></p><p>&nbsp;The last thing Merlin had said to him, even if it was with magic.&nbsp;Arthur knew now his own feelings for Merlin and it would seem a strong possibility that Merlin returned the same desire.&nbsp;It was not just that he had said &lsquo;love&rsquo; or that he had almost given his life.&nbsp;The proof was in the hundreds of hidden glances, the flash of a smile that brightened Arthur&rsquo;s day better than any springtime sun and, well it was spoken through his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin had not grown up at court and was simply unable to hide his emotions and thoughts as easily as Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;For all this evidence he had almost lost Merlin without ever doing anything about it.&nbsp;How many nights had they slept side-by-side, even on the same bed when necessary?&nbsp;He may be an inept servant but Merlin had never made a move and this both frustrated Arthur as he thought about it, and also made him respect Merlin a little more.</p><p>&nbsp;The man was a sorcerer; he could have powers beyond anyone&rsquo;s knowledge and this put him above a simple prince &ndash; yet he did not use his powers for his own desire.&nbsp;Merlin lay out there and did not know that his prince did indeed love him back.</p><p>&nbsp;Wiping at the moisture on his cheek Arthur looked at the tear in confusion.&nbsp;The crown-prince of Camelot does not cry.&nbsp;At least, that is what he had believed up until this very moment.&nbsp;Laying back on Merlin&rsquo;s bed clad in only his underclothes Arthur breathed in the scent that still clung to the surprisingly soft blanket.</p><p>&nbsp;It was all Merlin.&nbsp;Earthy but with some kind of fruity tang probably from those peaches he was always munching on.</p><p>&nbsp;More tears fell and Arthur let them.&nbsp;It was not for loss but how close he had come to losing everything that mattered.</p><p>&nbsp;Today he was allowed to cry.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>King&rsquo;s Audience Chamber, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Uther held the cross-bow and pursed his lips in anger.&nbsp;This weapon had almost killed his son and revealed the treachery lurking in his own court.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And you have the person responsible?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No sire,&rdquo; gulped the guardsman but stood his ground.&nbsp;He was well aware that if King Uther was displeased he could easily find himself in the dungeons or worse.&nbsp;&ldquo;It was found atop the bakery, from that point he had vantage over the entire market and north-gate &ndash; this was a planned attack my lord.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The king glared at the man but held his anger, he had a feeling this man had more to say.&nbsp;&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;This emboldened the guardsman who stepped forward and held out his hand for the cross-bow.&nbsp;Uther gave it and the man turned it over and brought the lever mechanism close for Uther to see.&nbsp;&ldquo;The white substance is flour sire, and when I first studied it there was fresh dough &ndash; put there I believe to make us believe the baker is responsible.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther shifted in his seat and brought up a gloved hand to stroke his jaw in consideration.&nbsp;&ldquo;You have spoken with the baker?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Missing,&rdquo; shrugged the guardsman.&nbsp;&ldquo;Probably dead.&nbsp;But I am almost certain it was not him my lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;The man&rsquo;s confidence seemed to crumble as Uther glared at him but he continued anyway.&nbsp;&ldquo;The morning&rsquo;s bread was already baked, and he would not prepare fresh dough until the evening, flour on the mechanism would implicate the baker but <i>fresh</i> dough actually absolves him.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Standing Uther brushed past him and stalked around the room.&nbsp;&ldquo;An assassin enters Camelot, attacks the crown-prince and escapes&hellip; all without anyone seeing him and you say he also has the time to place blame on one of my own citizens?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes sire,&rdquo; the guardsman whispered, scared to say more.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You are aware that magic was used during the incident,&rdquo; continued Uther, his gaze becoming penetrating.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; gulped the guardsman loudly.&nbsp;&ldquo;My investigation has concentrated on the assassination attempt, I was informed the&hellip; the magic was after the event, sire.&rdquo;&nbsp;The last was gasped out, as if he thought Uther might strike him down on the spot.</p><p>&nbsp;Stalking right up to the other man Uther breathed slowly.&nbsp;&ldquo;So <i>you</i> have decided that the crime here is not magic related, so your <i>investigation</i> is flawed.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;With respect my lord,&rdquo; spoke Morgana from the side.&nbsp;&ldquo;Magic saved Prince Arthur, a weapon made by men almost killed him.&nbsp;If magic was the perpetrator Arthur would be laying on Gaius&rsquo; table and not Merlin.&nbsp;Guardsman Jarrod was perhaps correct in following a line of inquiry that searches for a normal man, and not a sorcerer.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Avoiding looking directly at Morgana Uther returned to his throne.&nbsp;&ldquo;Camelot was locked down within minutes of the attack; if the assassin is indeed not a sorcerer then he will still be hiding within the walls.&nbsp;A search must be conducted of every building.&rdquo;&nbsp;The king&rsquo;s eyes locked on Jarrod.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you are correct then he will be found, if not.&rdquo;&nbsp;Uther shrugged and Jarrod found it hard to breath.</p><p>&nbsp;The dungeon suddenly sounded like a better alternative.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>The Alley outside Gaius&rsquo; Chamber, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; said Sir Gallfoy and half drew his sword.&nbsp;From a street over they could hear a commotion and the knights hesitated.&nbsp;Guarding this door was important but safe-guarding Camelot was their duty.&nbsp;Any hesitation was overcome when a scream pierced the air and they immediately ran towards the noise.</p><p>&nbsp;Seconds later a figure clad in black slipped down the wall and checked the alley.&nbsp;Finding it clear he cracked open the door and peered inside, luckily the knight sitting by the door was asleep if the soft snores were anything to go by.&nbsp;Stepping silently inside the figure surveyed the large chamber.</p><p>&nbsp;Only the knight and a figure lying on the table were visible.&nbsp;The only light came from a lamp across by the window and it was not bright enough to see more than a few shapes, certainly not enough to tell if the body on the table was Prince Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;Even if it wasn&rsquo;t the assassin knew he must be on the right track.&nbsp;Three knights would not be guarding a servant&rsquo;s quarters.&nbsp;Payment was only forthcoming on success and if that meant a little extra danger then all the better.&nbsp;Henry, for that was the name he used these days, crept closer to the table.&nbsp;The dagger came out of its scabbard with barely a sound and he raised it above the prone figure.</p><p>&nbsp;Darkness allowed no features apart from a mop of hair to show.&nbsp;It had to be Arthur though, who else would be in the physicians&rsquo; rooms?&nbsp;While hiding throughout the day Henry had heard wild stories ranging from the King actually being dead to Arthur being alive and unharmed.&nbsp;The assassin knew he had hit Arthur squarely in the chest, he&rsquo;d seen the bolt enter and the prince go down.&nbsp;He may survive that wound but not this one.</p><p>&nbsp;The door across the room suddenly burst open and light poured forth.&nbsp;The figure standing in the doorway yelled out &ldquo;Merlin!&rdquo; and Henry blanched, recognising the voice as Arthur.&nbsp;He stared down to see the Prince&rsquo;s manservant staring up at him, not a drop of fear in his eyes even though a dagger was hanging over him.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Gaius&rsquo; Chambers, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Merlin thrust out his fist and it connected with the assassin&rsquo;s kidney.&nbsp;The pain made the man draw away, giving Merlin the chance to reach out and grab one of Gaius&rsquo; instruments, luckily the long bladed scalpel.&nbsp;As the man turned back and tried to stab him Merlin blocked the blade and counter-thrust, he missed but managed another deflection from the assassin.&nbsp;This happened half-a-dozen times in quick succession and Merlin was a little amazed he could do such a thing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>His arm was quickly tiring and his chest was extremely painful so he tried to draw on his magic to throw the man across the room.&nbsp;The power was there but it felt like water slipping through his fingers, he just couldn&rsquo;t focus it.&nbsp;The man knocked his scalpel away and thrust down, Merlin braced himself for more pain when there was a dull crack like thunder and the man went flying across the room in a cloud of purple light.&nbsp;He hit the wall and crumpled down just as the knight by the door jumped in with his sword.</span></p><p>&nbsp;It had all happened in a matter of moments but one thing Merlin knew for sure &ndash; that burst of magic had not been his.</p><p>&nbsp;He looked across at Arthur who stood, his hand still outstretched with a look of amazement and horror on his features.</p><p>&nbsp;More importantly Merlin saw the flash of gold fade from Arthur&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; whispered Merlin.&nbsp;Yet he knew it for what it was.</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur was a sorcerer.</p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/4204.html"">AshtakRa Masterfile</a></p></lj-cut>"

I am sure you would much rather be hovering around that traitor with the rest of the court.&quot;&nbsp;He said it blandly and without malice which made Morgana worry all the more.&nbsp;Anger she could understand, but this apparent indifference was something new.</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;I am content to be here at <i>your</i> side my Lord,&quot; she answered quietly, smoothing down a crease in her dress and eyeing off the pitcher of wine.&nbsp;It was quite improper to drink before the King had first partaken but the day was hot and dry and besides which&hellip; if ever there was a time.</p><p>&quot;The court merely concerns itself with Arthur's welfare and through him your own.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;Uther laughed humourlessly.&nbsp;&quot;Do not try to placate me Morgana, I am well aware of the ebb and flow of Camelot.&nbsp;Today they saw magic perform a miracle and think it wondrous and fantastical &ndash; they will call for <i>him</i> to be spared and beg of my mercy.&quot;&nbsp;He stopped pacing and placed his hands flat on the table, his brow creasing in the first signs of anger.&nbsp;&quot;Yet they forget that magic in any guise is but a front for evil&hellip; today a life was saved but tomorrow?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana breathed slowly and remained seated.&nbsp;Over the past few months she had grown to understand Uther a great deal.&nbsp;While she still found some of his traits loathsome he was not the tyrant she once thought.&nbsp;Ruthless, and sometimes misguided but he was not always exerting power just for the sake of it.&nbsp;This time though, his depth of hatred for magic could override what should be an easy decision.&nbsp;Merlin had saved Arthur, again, and because of that Uther should spare his life &ndash; more than that he should elevate Merlin from servant to peer.&nbsp;Of course he would not do that unless carefully guided.</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;Arthur is alive because of a simple truth my Lord &ndash; magic can be a force for good, as well as evil.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;That is the seduction of it,&quot; murmured the king.&nbsp;&quot;You believe that with magic anything can be done &ndash; and in the right hands all will be well, but it won&rsquo;t and if I must be the monster to protect the kingdom from itself then so be it.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;A sword is sharp and deadly in any hands Uther, yet we do not outlaw them.&quot;&nbsp;She dared to use his name but he seemed not to notice and just gave her a hard stare.</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;Nor do I allow my enemies to enter Camelot so armed Morgana,&quot; Uther countered.&nbsp;&quot;A person is easily stripped of armour, or sword and knife &ndash; but magic cannot be so removed&hellip; the life of the sorcerer is what powers their magic and therefore it is life that must be removed.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana stood and walked around to him, placing a hand over his.&nbsp;&quot;An enemy's sword is no longer dangerous if you embrace them as friends &ndash; it can instead be turned to fight for you.&nbsp;How many times have we been attacked by magic Uther, and how valuable an ally would a sorcerer be to fight back?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;The issue is trust,&quot; said Uther, not removing her hand nor commenting on the continued use of his name.&nbsp;&quot;How do you trust someone who deals in sorcery &ndash; its very nature is pretence and trickery?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;Merlin does not have a deceitful bone in his body my Lord-.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;Do-not-say-his-name,&quot; hissed Uther and made a fist with his other hand, noticeable he did not make a move against Morgana and this gave her hope.</p><p>&nbsp;She waited but when he said nothing more Morgana continued.&nbsp;&quot;It was not magic that almost took Arthur's life today, but it was magic that saved him &ndash; and <i>Merlin</i> would ask for nothing in return, not even his own life.&quot;&nbsp;She lifted both hands and placed them on Uther's cheeks.&nbsp;&quot;You needs ask yourself if you trust Merlin, or is it that you fear him, aye, fear Uther Pendragon &ndash; I see it in your eyes and feel it in the cool of your hand every time I say his name.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;She was expecting a denial, an outburst of anger but instead Uther slumped.&nbsp;His face seemed to take on ten years and she was sure the beginning of a tear formed at the corner of his eye.</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;I have seen already the power Merlin has over my son &ndash; and that was without sorcery&hellip; <i>with</i> it I fear not for my own soul, but for Arthur's.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana was at first elated that Uther could at least say Merlin's name, but then the truth of his words sunk in.&nbsp;As a seer she sometimes knew prophecy when she heard it, and Uther had just spoken of future events that not even he could ever imagine.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Town Square</u><u>, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;&quot;I saw it with my own eyes, a great blue flame shot out but hurt no-one, and where the Prince lay now was the Sorcerer hi'self.&nbsp;I ask yer, what man could do such a thing?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Main Stables, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;&quot;A servant, like ourselves, and he brushes the King aside like he was nothing but a sack of bread&hellip; then he goes and saves Prince Arthur.&nbsp;Imagine it, a nobody who's able to do that?&nbsp;Makes you wonder doesn't it?</p><p>&nbsp;<u>South</u><u> Bridge</u><u>, outside Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Twenty years I seen the magic folk go the gallows.&nbsp;Some I knew and aye, I liked them well enough but not close like.&nbsp;Yet the thought of this one troubles me, he did save young Arthur?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;<u>The Alley outside Gaius&rsquo; Chamber, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;Knights Gallfoy and Haddon eyed the pikeman who trudged by and waited for the man to pass out of hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always liked Merlin, pity to see him burn&hellip; and then of course there&rsquo;s Arthur.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Sir Haddon smirked at his fellow&rsquo;s comments.&nbsp;&ldquo;No need to sound me out Gallfoy, I think it&rsquo;d be wrong and I&rsquo;ll do what I can to see it doesn&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s pray to the gods Uther sees sense.&nbsp;Merlin&rsquo;s good for Arthur and a sorcerer&hellip; I don&rsquo;t mind saying that considering what we&rsquo;ve faced lately he&rsquo;d be mighty useful.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;This brought a laugh from Sir Haddon.&nbsp;&ldquo;Poor Gallfoy, so blind I wonder how you&rsquo;ve lived this long.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Leaning in the knight clapped a hand on the other&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;You think Merlin hasn&rsquo;t saved us a dozen times already?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;A scream interrupted their talk, from inside and each bowed their heads.&nbsp;They had been around enough battles to know what was happening.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; whispered the first.&nbsp;&ldquo;If the time comes?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stand together, Uther will not have him,&rdquo; finished Sir Haddon, and was a little surprised at how much he meant it.&nbsp;Until today he&rsquo;d never given Merlin much consideration, but all of a sudden the young man was all he could think about.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Inside</u></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin!&rdquo; shouted Arthur and held his face as Merlin&rsquo;s eyes rolled back and he slumped.</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius paused his padding of the wound and felt Merlin&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tis alright Arthur, he&rsquo;s just passed out.&nbsp;At last I must say, threading him back together will be much easier this way.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Noticing the slight humour Arthur relaxed a little.&nbsp;&ldquo;This means you were successful Gaius, he will live?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;A smile graced the old man&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;&ldquo;We must be careful of infection and I am not sure how his lung will fare but for now, yes, Merlin will live.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur couldn&rsquo;t stop the grin and hugged Gaius tightly, the healer eventually having to force him back to continue his work.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind sire &ndash; and while I&rsquo;m busy you should clean up.&rdquo;&nbsp;Arthur hesitated and looked to Merlin, his expression full of concern.&nbsp;Gaius tutted firmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur, you&rsquo;re covered in blood and your clothes are ruined, if Merlin wakes he will not want to see you this way.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Nodding slowly Arthur looked around the room.&nbsp;Amongst themselves the Knights had arranged for two to be at the door and one inside, just in case Uther sent guards.&nbsp;Luckily the King had done no such thing and they had not had to test their resolve.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I will need to go to my rooms, my father may not let me leave once there.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Already taken care of my Lord,&rdquo; spoke Gwen from the door.&nbsp;In her hands she held a bundle of clothes for Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;He sighed in defeat and went over to take them, pecking a kiss to her cheek.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think in private you can call me Arthur, we&rsquo;ve been through enough recently to warrant a small informality?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gwen blushed and shook her head.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think-.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I insist Gwen,&rdquo; said Arthur and gave her his best smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;Besides Merlin never waited for my permission to take such liberties, and I still like him well enough.&rdquo;&nbsp;His face grew more serious as Gwen nodded and turned to where Merlin lay.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep, but Gaius says it looks hopeful that he&rsquo;ll make a full recovery.&rdquo;&nbsp;The lie was a little one and besides, she probably knew better than him the chances of recovery from such a wound.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That is good, I just worry that Uther,&rdquo; Gwen hesitated and turned back to Arthur.&nbsp;&ldquo;My father, he wasn&rsquo;t even a sorcerer and look what happened &ndash; the whole city knows of Merlin now&hellip; Uther will have no choice.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I know how much you care for him,&rdquo; Arthur spoke softly so only she could hear him and put an arm around her.&nbsp;&ldquo;I promise you I&rsquo;ll let nothing happen and I want you to know how sorry I am that I could not do the same for your father &ndash; he was a good man and did not deserve-.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gwen stopped him from saying anymore by kissing his cheek in return.&nbsp;The Prince smiled and moved to Merlin&rsquo;s room to change before looking back as Gwen sat by the bench and held Merlin&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;Something about the two of them together sang to him, as if it was part of some harmony the universe had been waiting for.&nbsp;Arthur knew that whatever this connection was it included him.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not put much faith in fortune telling but he had a feeling he had just felt a brush from the hand of fate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;</p></lj-cut><br />"

Noise; there was so much of it.&nbsp;Voices raised, screams from afar and Arthur&hellip; above all he heard Arthur bellow for Gaius, and then he would curse his father &ndash;&nbsp;he would curse Merlin and order him to change them back, to undo what had been done.&nbsp;This almost made Merlin smile, the fact that even now Arthur would try to give him orders, as if he had followed them in the past.</span></p><p>&nbsp;Best of all he would bring his face close to Merlin&rsquo;s ear and whisper that he must hold on; that he would not lose him this way.&nbsp;It was almost enough to let Merlin feel okay about dying.</p><p>&nbsp;Except he wasn&rsquo;t, dying that was.&nbsp;Much as there was blood everywhere, and he couldn&rsquo;t breath and his vision was all blurry &ndash; the world did not fade away and the pain remained.&nbsp;Perhaps this was his punishment for ignoring all the rules, for doing what should never be done.&nbsp;Then another thought wiggled its way in, past the pain and the fear&hellip; maybe something was holding him here &ndash; not to torture him but to save him.</p><p>&nbsp;Maybe?</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Gaius&rsquo; Chambers, Camelot</u></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Put him on the table,&rdquo; ordered Gaius tersely, not daring to waste time watching them as he gathered what he needed from the shelves spread around the room.&nbsp;He heard the breaking of pots as the table was cleared and allowed himself to wince with the rude thought that even in the throes of mortal injury Merlin managed to make a mess.</p><p>&nbsp;Shuffling over he examined the wound, much easier to see in the beam of light from the window.&nbsp;The bolt was definitely lodged in one lung and although there was bleeding it was not arterial and that gave them time.&nbsp;He wiped away some blood to get a better understanding of the type of bolt and Merlin gasped and moved sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold him,&rdquo; snapped Gaius and the two knights did so immediately.&nbsp;They had arrived shortly after he had at the gate, probably preparing themselves to see their Prince dead.&nbsp;Instead the word that Arthur was slain was wrong, it was Merlin and he was still alive &ndash; barely.&nbsp;A word from Arthur had these two and the other half dozen Knights that followed both carry Merlin and make a hole through the ever increasing crowd.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur had not left Merlin&rsquo;s side and even now, covered in blood and with a face so distraught, he refused any suggestion to leave.&nbsp;Gaius had to shake his head at the sight.&nbsp;Had it been twenty years ago the scene was not much different except it was Uther standing there with Igraine in his arms.&nbsp;Gaius had failed then, he promised himself today would be different.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;I said hold him by gods,&rdquo; he hissed again and used a sharp blade to remove the remnants of Merlin&rsquo;s shirt.&nbsp;&ldquo;One wrong move and we could cause more bleeding.&rdquo;&nbsp;Picking up a piece of reed, sharpened at one end Gaius spared a look at Arthur.&nbsp;&ldquo;This will sound worse than it is.&rdquo;&nbsp;He felt around and counted bones until he reached the point he was after, without waiting any longer he plunged the reed down, through Merlin&rsquo;s chest.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur flinched at the sight and then turned away as, with a gurgling sound, bits of blood and flesh flew from the end of the reed.&nbsp;It only lasted a moment then a whistling could be heard as the air trapped in Merlin&rsquo;s chest escaped.&nbsp;Almost immediately Merlin gasped loudly and took a breath.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Easy son,&rdquo; murmured Gaius, putting a hand to Merlin&rsquo;s cheek and looking into his eyes to ensure he heard him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Lightly now, just soft breaths &ndash; you only have one lung working.&rdquo;&nbsp;Merlin must have heard because his panting slowed and he gave obvious signs of trying to relax his need for air.</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius grabbed one of Sir Bedivere&rsquo;s hands and made him put a finger on the reed&rsquo;s tip just as a whistling stopped.&nbsp;&ldquo;Every few minutes you must release the air, otherwise Merlin will be unable to breath.&rdquo;&nbsp;The Knight, no older than Merlin, nodded silently and stared at his finger as if it alone was keeping Merlin alive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius nodded and pursed is lips.&nbsp;Like Arthur most of the knights had been reluctant to leave Merlin&rsquo;s side even when there was nothing for them to do.&nbsp;Was Merlin even aware of how much he had enamoured himself not just to Merlin but to Arthur&rsquo;s inner-circle?</p><p>&nbsp;He turned to Arthur, who was softly telling Merlin to not speak and just stay still; it was good to know that for once Merlin was listening and obeyed.&nbsp;Gaius forced Arthur from Merlin&rsquo;s side and led him to the wash basin where he washed Arthur&rsquo;s hands; for his part, the Prince knew enough of Gaius&rsquo; medicinal methods to not argue.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I have to warn you sire,&rdquo; said Gaius softly, hoping Merlin would not hear them. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have never successfully treated a wound this serious.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur breathed slowly.&nbsp;&ldquo;If anyone can Gaius, it is you&hellip; but?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes Arthur,&rdquo; Gaius used his name, it was appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;The Prince&rsquo;s lip trembled for only a moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if something more could be done, something,&rdquo; he raised his head and stared straight at Gaius.&nbsp;&ldquo;What if we used magic, it is why he&rsquo;s here and not me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius closed his eyes and shook his head slowly.&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&nbsp;Absolutely not.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; implored Arthur.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin&rsquo;s already under threat of execution for using sorcery but I can assure you that neither him, nor anyone who uses magic to save him, will suffer that fate.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;There was such resolve in his voice, such conviction that Gaius felt pride that finally the Prince was coming into his own, becoming the King he would one day be.&nbsp;That did not change the reality.&nbsp;&ldquo;It cannot be Arthur, you think I wouldn&rsquo;t defy Uther to save Merlin?&nbsp;But it is because Merlin used magic that we cannot do the same.&nbsp;It may undo what has already been achieved, or worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If it means I may end up back there instead of him I will take the risk,&rdquo; said Arthur without hesitation.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That is not the risk Arthur,&rdquo; explained Gaius carefully.&nbsp;&ldquo;Right now I may yet save him with medicine and science - and if I do the laws of nature have not been broken.&nbsp;It would be as if I had saved you with the same treatment, but if we invoke magic,&rdquo; he shrugged his arms to say that the results could be catastrophic.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is not just your life, or Merlin&rsquo;s that could be in jeopardy, and Merlin would not want that.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur finally nodded in understanding and stood tall, drying his hands on a clean cloth.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me what you need Gaius, anything from anywhere and it will be done.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius gave him a list, loud enough for everyone to hear.&nbsp;Nothing unusual, plenty of hot water, clean cloth and extra lanterns.&nbsp;That and privacy &ndash; no-one could disturb them, especially during the most dangerous part, the removal of the bolt.</p><p>&nbsp;The knights themselves moved to do as he asked Gaius spared a glance at Arthur with a questioning look and the Prince must have understood for he let his gaze wander about the room and he raised his voice.&nbsp;&ldquo;Before we go further everyone should know the risk you undertake.&nbsp;My father may well punish any and everyone who helps Mer- Merlin.&rdquo;&nbsp;His voice caught on having to say the name and Gaius placed a hand softly on Arthur&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&nbsp;The Knights only stopped while Arthur had been speaking, once finished they went immediately back to their tasks, not one hesitated nor left the room.&nbsp;Gaius smiled and he noticed a glimmer of one crossed Arthur&rsquo;s lips &ndash; with loyalty like this he would be not only a great King but a leader unparalleled.</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur returned to the table and whispered in Merlin&rsquo;s ear, smoothing his hair in the process; Merlin&rsquo;s eyes stared at him with utter trust and devotion.&nbsp;Not breaking eye contact with Merlin Arthur finally nodded and spoke softly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do it Gaius, do it now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Gaius gripped the bolt with some pliers and prepared himself &ndash; on the battlefield this is usually when the patient suffered the most, and then died.</p><p>&nbsp;Not this time, promised Gaius, not Merlin.</p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;</p>&nbsp;<a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/4204.html"">AshtakRa Masterfile</a><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

even if it wasn&rsquo;t the most lady-like of poses.&nbsp;Avoiding a particularly nasty bunch of slimy lettuce she spared a glare for the child that threw it.&nbsp;The look, added with the danger of hitting &lsquo;her lady&rsquo; with rotten produce scared away any further missiles.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin, I have seen it &ndash; Arthur&rsquo;s life is in danger.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;A sigh.&nbsp;&ldquo;His life is always in danger, its what keeps us all awake at night &ndash; well not you since by sleeping you can actually help&hellip; not that I&rsquo;m saying &ndash; oh sod it!&rdquo;&nbsp;He hung his head, obviously realising he could not improve his argument.&nbsp;Morgana was a little surprised.&nbsp;Often Merlin was more animated and dare she think it, happy when on the stocks.&nbsp;It was if he got some kind of perverse enjoyment when people were throwing rotten foodstuff at him.</p><p>&nbsp;But not today; his eyes were downcast and his lips drooped down in what she could only surmise was some kind of foul mood.&nbsp;Merlin and bad mood just did not fit and for a moment she almost asked what was wrong, before she remembered why she was here.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she agreed.&nbsp;It was true that they did all spend an inordinate amount of time keeping the young Prince alive, but then it was because he was the heir that made him a target.&nbsp;&ldquo;But Merlin this time it is a very strong telling, I have had one like this before and I-.&rdquo; she had to stop and compose herself, especially as they were in view of the entire market; thankfully none could hear them though.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The last time I felt this way there was a very definite choice of life or death.&nbsp;Most times I see futures where a variety of choices can alter fate &ndash; but with this it will be a stark decision and the wrong one will cost Arthur his life.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&nbsp;The lack of response from Merlin made Morgana squat down to see his eyes, most inappropriate but she was beyond caring at the moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he hissed then seemed to collect himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, yes my Lady.&nbsp;Arthur, death, almost certain unless we, probably me, do something.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;She risked cupping his jaw to force him to look at her.&nbsp;Whatever bothered him still lingered, she could see it in his eyes and in the way he held his mouth &ndash; almost as if he was trying not to cry.&nbsp;Knowing he needed to talk but realising this was not the time or place she could only smile reassuringly and nodded at the guard across the square.&nbsp;The man rushed up quickly and with a wave of her hand he asked no questions as he released the lock and Merlin stood with Morgana&rsquo;s help.</p><p>&nbsp;Together they walked to her quarters, Merlin did not question their direction once and said nothing as she closed the doors and led him to the chair.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He looked at her then and she sensed such pain and, if she was right, betrayal.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He made a small wave in one direction, which Morgana rightly supposed meant Arthur&rsquo;s room, and therefore Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ask, normally he asks.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What!&rdquo;&nbsp;A myriad of thoughts went through her mind and it must have showed on her face because Merlin blanched and shook his head.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No, not that!&nbsp;I mean&hellip; oh Gods &ndash; all I meant was he usually asks for me to cover for him &ndash; but this time,&rdquo; he shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess its just expected, I mean I&rsquo;ve done it so many times maybe he thinks a request isn&rsquo;t needed.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered and tried to cover up her earlier thoughts by smoothing down her dress.&nbsp;Merlin must have sensed her discomfort because he finally smiled, it didn&rsquo;t quite reach his eyes but it at least it was a start.&nbsp;Morgana continued, &ldquo;Well that was wrong of him, I am sure you know that no-one can order someone to lie to the King, not even Arthur.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; whispered Merlin softly.&nbsp;&ldquo;But Arthur knows I would, regardless of the consequences &ndash; but not being asked, it made me feel&hellip;&rdquo; he sighed and laughed.&nbsp;&ldquo;It made me feel like a servant, stupid &ndash; since that&rsquo;s exactly what I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana sat next to him and began plucking out pieces of what must have been week old beans.&nbsp;&ldquo;Perhaps that is the relationship that was intended &ndash; but even from the start I would say that you and Arthur are not simply master and servant.&rdquo;&nbsp;She paused and was unsure how to continue on this path without betraying confidences of her own. &nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur can be&hellip; unthinkingly cruel, especially with those closest to him &ndash; it is the result of having a father like Uther.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Merlin finally pulled away from Morgana and moved to a wash pan, running some water over his head even though it must have been ice-cold.&nbsp;&ldquo;So do you know how and when his life will be in peril, do we have time?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana smiled, Merlin was far from settled from whatever advantage Arthur had taken but his healing had begun.&nbsp;It was, Morgana realised, something that the so called nobility was poorly lacking &ndash; the ability to move on and not hold a grudge.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There will be laughter and the sound of drums.&nbsp;The guards will be distracted and an assassin will strike &ndash; I see blood and shock on the faces of the King and&hellip; and myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin paused with his hair still quite wet.&nbsp;&ldquo;So it will need to be at some royal function &ndash; an event that requires your presence and by the sound of it, the entire court.&nbsp;A happy event, with drums as entertainment.&rdquo;&nbsp;He put a finger to chin in deep thought and Morgana had to hold her mirth; with hair dripping and bits of rotten fruit on his blue shirt Merlin looked utterly ridiculous trying to appear scholarly yet at the same time so endearing.</p><p>&nbsp;She could see why Arthur loved him - if only Arthur knew how to show that love in a way that didn&rsquo;t hurt or scar.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Do we know if this is soon?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana shook her head sadly.&nbsp;&ldquo;There is no way to know &ndash; except by the sounds and the sight, but I fear by then it may be too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;A different expression of determination came upon Merlin&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;&ldquo;The instant you suspect the moment is upon us let me know; regardless of the consequences I will stop it&hellip;&rdquo; a sadness came upon him and it was all Morgana could do not to hug him.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;My destiny.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;<i>A month later:</i></p><p>&nbsp;<u>The Caves of Ghurloi&rsquo;n</u></p><p>&nbsp;His fellow Knight hit the wall with a dull thump and fell at Arthur&rsquo;s feet, the angle of his head showing that his was a quick death.&nbsp;The beast turned its eyes on the survivors, hunger in its eyes and Arthur did not hesitate.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin!&nbsp;Get Gwen out of here.&rdquo;&nbsp;As Arthur brought his sword up against his shield in a move that was so practiced it required little conscious thought he smiled for a moment as his manservant obeyed&hellip; for once without question.</p><p>&nbsp;It would be so like Merlin to argue in the midst of mortal danger.</p><p>&nbsp;Thoughts of a wilfully disobedient servant were pushed aside as the giant lizard with fangs the size of Uther&rsquo;s throne snapped at the place Arthur had been but a moment before.&nbsp;He struck back and cursed as the sword bounced off the thick hide &ndash; it would require more than simple steel to kill this creature.</p><p>&nbsp;Using shield and sword Arthur worked his way inside the beast&rsquo;s killing range and tried to stab an eye, hoping to disable it enough to get away and regroup.&nbsp;The lizard was too quick and swung its head, knocking sword aside and in the process sending Arthur flying across the cave.&nbsp;He landed better than the dead Knight but it was heavy enough to knock the wind out of him as he desperately tried to stand but failed.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the wind on his back Arthur knew he was by the entrance and he grimaced as the beast moved towards him; <i>so near and yet so far</i> as his boyhood instructor had been fond of saying.&nbsp;Trying to gain a breath to at least yell a last curse of defiance Arthur instead felt more than saw an arm wrap around his waist and pull him swiftly out of the way.&nbsp;A murmur near his ear was drowned out by the roar of the creature and the sudden cracking of the cave ceiling.&nbsp;Just as they cleared the entrance the cave collapsed and the lizard&rsquo;s call was suddenly cut off.</span></p><p>&nbsp;As the dust and dirt cleared Arthur looked down and was unsurprised to see the arm belonged to Merlin and was still attached; little choice since the Prince was basically lying atop his servant and said servant could not move if he tried.&nbsp;Much as Arthur wanted to it was difficult; the death of the beast meant it was the first time he could relax in the last few hours, and scrawny as Merlin was he was infinitely more comfortable than the hard ground.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; A muffled protest made him finally roll off but his legs were still too shaky to stand so Arthur lay and looked into the eyes of Merlin, that for a split moment seemed not their usual blue but somewhat golden.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he finally murmured.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry <i>Sire</i>, didn&rsquo;t quite catch that?&rdquo;&nbsp;Merlin&rsquo;s grin was matched only by the impertinent tone of his voice and Arthur scowled.&nbsp;How was it that he was encumbered by someone who, while able to save his life now and again, was the most insubordinate, lazy and un-coordinated person Arthur had ever met?</p><p>&nbsp;What vexed him further was not wanting to trade Merlin for anyone &ndash; nor change him.&nbsp;Merlin without that idiotically self-satisfied smile would not be half as&hellip; dare he say cute?&nbsp;Such thoughts were not only un-Princely when thinking of one&rsquo;s servant, they were inconsiderate when Gwen was leaning against a tree and in some obvious distress, Arthur shook his head and took stock of their situation.</p><p>&nbsp;The creature was, if not dead, then contained.&nbsp;They were alive, well some of them; and the local farmers would be safe to work their fields again.</p><p>&nbsp;He cuffed Merlin&rsquo;s head, not worried since the hair on that boy&rsquo;s head couldn&rsquo;t get any more out of place.&nbsp;&ldquo;I said <i>thanks</i> Merlin, but then I may take it back since as always you were late &ndash; that cave-in could of killed me, come to think of it the timing was rather convenient don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin&rsquo;s expression looked entirely too perplexed for a moment before he mumbled something about Sir Henry&rsquo;s fall probably weakening the rock wall.&nbsp;Arthur was not entirely convinced but what other explanation could there be?&nbsp;He had his suspicions but there more important things &ndash; like Gwen.</p><p>&nbsp;Shuffling over Arthur took her shaking hands and made the appropriate comforting words and put another arm around her shoulders.&nbsp;Either forgetting it was the Prince beside her or feeling comfortable enough to touch him so intimately Gwen buried her head in his chest and sobbed quietly.&nbsp;He let her and said nothing; letting her cry out the fear and grief.&nbsp;It was probably more grief as it had been noticeable that the young Sir Henry had been quite protective of Gwen, more so than just Knight and maiden without a deeper relationship being implied.</p><p>&nbsp;Only when he noticed Merlin still lying down did Arthur lift Gwen&rsquo;s head, kiss her tenderly on the temple and let her sit back against the tree.&nbsp;The kiss was more friend than anything and it briefly crossed Arthur&rsquo;s mind to try and place when such closeness between them had occurred.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;A head covered in ruffled black hair peered at him and Arthur scowled.&nbsp;How dare Merlin look so exhausted, as if he had done anything more than run and drag people around?</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If you have the time to get the horses ready that would be ever so kind of you, I would so much prefer getting back to Camelot by nightfall.&rdquo;&nbsp;He tried to phrase it as a sarcastic order but somehow Merlin just smiled and nodded; once again turning the tables as if Arthur had indeed made a reasonable request of a friend.</p><p>&nbsp;As Merlin stood and got the horses Arthur wondered how his father did it?&nbsp;No servant or indeed courtier would ever treat him with such&hellip; equitability &ndash; and get away with it.</p><p>&nbsp;But what could he do?&nbsp;It <i>was</i> Merlin and if Arthur was truly honest with himself, as he usually could be after facing death, it was hard not to fall just a little bit in love with the guy.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Camelot</u>: <u>Northern Gate</u></p><p>&nbsp;Morgana waited patiently by Uther&rsquo;s side, the watch had signalled that the Prince was returning.&nbsp;Of course patiently meant she held the King&rsquo;s hand so tight he had winced more than once but it seems this time he understood.&nbsp;Arthur had been gone almost a week with no word.&nbsp;Add to that Merlin and Gwen were with him, along with two knights and the weight of the Kingdom on their shoulders.&nbsp;If the beast could not be stopped the harvest would be ruined while still in the fields and Camelot would face rationing.&nbsp;Rationing would lead to higher crime, which would force a crack down on law and order and that would lead to more people joining rebellious forces.&nbsp;Uther had explained it so much better but Morgana tried to keep it simple in her head.</p><p>&nbsp;They had already started restricting the sale of wheat and that had almost caused a riot.&nbsp;Upon the call that the Prince was returning Uther had decided to greet him personally, remind their people that while Arthur had saved them he <i>was</i> Uther&rsquo;s son.&nbsp;Uther rarely did something without a hidden agenda and Morgana was not sure if she hated him for it or owed him respect, perhaps a little of both.</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur, next to Merlin and Gwen, rode through the gate.&nbsp;There were smiles on their faces and Arthur was laughing, clapping Merlin warmly on the shoulder.&nbsp;Morgana smiled at this, and also that they were alive. &nbsp;The word had been there was only three riders and she feared who was lost and while she would still mourn the knights it was not entirely unselfish to be pleased it was not her dearest friends.&nbsp;Gwen smiled back demurely as befit her station but Merlin in his usual oblivious way gave a toothy grin and waved.&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; A grunt beside her joined by a muffled &lsquo;idiot&rsquo; told Morgana what Uther thought of Arthur&rsquo;s manservant.&nbsp;She decided not to mention that Uther&rsquo;s punishments had softened the more he got to know Merlin, so much so that it was rare to see him in the stocks at all anymore.&nbsp;Perhaps Merlin had grown on the king but more likely Uther recognised the change in Arthur and was observant enough to guess at its source.&nbsp;Not that he would ever admit it and Morgana understood that, for the most part.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Guinevere, Merlin,&rdquo; she nodded as they rode past and dismounted, each giving a small bow to the king.&nbsp;Perhaps he would have demanded more but his eyes were on the next rider as Prince Arthur jumped down and walked his horse the few remaining yards to his father.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;As Morgana stepped back she watched father and son embrace and her heart softened somewhat for Uther; this was not for any ulterior motive &ndash; he had truly been concerned for Arthur and was pleased more than anyone by his return.</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur let his arms fall but Uther kept one around his shoulder and turned to the gathering crowd.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Prince Arthur has returned!&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp;&ldquo;And with it the peace and prosperity of the -.&rdquo;&nbsp;Uther frowned, his speech was interrupted by loud banging as a carpenter thumped away one street over.&nbsp;The poor soul was probably unaware of the King&rsquo;s impromptu audience and Morgana feared how Uther would react.</p><p>&nbsp;With surprise she saw the King smile and wave the guards back from running towards the perpetrator.&nbsp;&ldquo;Perhaps not the peace then,&rdquo; he said loud enough for the few of them to hear as the banging continued.&nbsp;It was not that humorous but probably due to the recent battle Arthur needed a release and he let go a loud laugh, one which Uther joined quickly.</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana&rsquo;s smile at the special moment between father and son froze as the events fell into place.</p><p>&nbsp;The hammering &ndash; which sounded like a drum.</p><p>&nbsp;The loud laughter.</p><p>&nbsp;The guards indecisive about what to do.</p><p>&nbsp;The three of them here &ndash; together.</p><p>&nbsp;She spun around.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Her urgency was immediately apparent to Merlin and he made a step towards Arthur, as if to somehow shield him, but the distance was too far; he started to raise his hand and Morgana saw his eyes flash gold.</p><p>&nbsp;Too late she heard a dull thump behind her and the laughter ceased abruptly.</p><p>&nbsp;Everything happened in a blur.&nbsp;Arthur collapsed, a cross-bow bolt sticking out from his chest.&nbsp;Uther tried to hold him up while shielding him at the same time.&nbsp;Guards rushed forward and shouts were made for reinforcements.</p><p>&nbsp;Then it seemed to slow as Morgana watched Uther suddenly realise Merlin&rsquo;s posture &ndash; his hand outstretched as if throwing something and his eyes a magical golden hue.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You!&rdquo; growled the King and his face screwed up in rage.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sieze him!&rdquo; Uther shouted, indicating Merlin.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Morgana tried to intervene but was pushed aside by a pikeman.</p><p>&nbsp;The other soldiers had hesitated, not sure if Uther really meant Merlin &ndash; and it was all Merlin needed.&nbsp;His hand changed position and he swept it around.&nbsp;Every guard was pushed back and they seemed stuck in place, held by nothing but air.&nbsp;Uther cursed and drew his sword, still holding Arthur but keeping the tip in Merlin&rsquo;s direction.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Traitor,&rdquo; spat the King.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do not think you will get past me &ndash; you will burn a slow death, I will see your family strung up; I will not rest until -.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The sword and Uther went flying to the side as Merlin rushed in to grab Arthur.&nbsp;Merlin did not spare the King another look, he had eyes only for the Prince.</p><p>&nbsp;Morgana ran forward too, managing to stop Arthur from falling back and she held him up while Merlin desperately tried to plug the wound.&nbsp;Blood was seeping from where the bolt had entered through cloth and leather &ndash; this close to the city Arthur did nor have armour on, not that it would have stopped a cross-bow.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; choked Merlin, tears in his eyes.&nbsp;His face betrayed the emotions Morgana was feeling but was too shocked to show.&nbsp;They had failed him &ndash; they had been too slow.</p><p>&nbsp;From the other side Gwen used a cloth to also stem the blood and she too, with tears in her eyes, had the expression of someone who could not believe what she was seeing.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It cannot end this way,&rdquo; whispered Merlin and at that moment he looked directly into Morgana&rsquo;s eyes and she felt a ripple of his power roll over her.&nbsp;It was not a surprise but the texture of it was &ndash; she had been around magic before and had never sensed anything so powerful.&nbsp;His eyes literally glowed and she felt as if part of her was being drawn in, pulled like some invisible force had reached inside her chest and clasped her by the heart.</p><p>&nbsp;She realised what he was doing; he needed every bit of power there was and he was drawing on hers - she stopped fighting and gave it to him.&nbsp;Merlin smiled ever so slightly and in a voice only she could hear he said, &ldquo;<i>Look after him Morgana &ndash; he will need you more than ever in the coming days</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Somehow she knew what he was planning and she whispered a &ldquo;No Merlin,&rdquo; but it was all she could manage; Merlin had her in thrall and she was unable to move.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It will <i>not</i> end this way,&rdquo; Merlin said aloud more forcefully.</p><p>&nbsp;He grabbed Arthur&rsquo;s hand and tore off the glove, slipping his own hand to grasp the Prince&rsquo;s bare flesh firmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur, listen to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Arthur, still conscious but in great pain rolled his eyes but somehow focused on his friend.&nbsp;He smiled then, as if the pain had suddenly receded and it was only the two of them.&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin.&rdquo;&nbsp;In all her time Morgana had never heard Arthur say Merlin&rsquo;s name with such heartfelt meaning.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your hand feels nice, warm.&rdquo;&nbsp;His normally white teeth were stained with pink blood and Morgana had been around enough soldiers to know the importance of that&hellip; his lung was punctured.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; intoned Merlin, his voice becoming that of a teacher to student rather than servant to master or even friend to friend.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to concentrate on my voice &ndash; block out everything but the sound of my voice.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;In the beginnings of some kind of trance Arthur nodded slowly, the blood now trickling from his lips but he seemed unaware of it.&nbsp;Holding Arthur&rsquo;s hand in a vice-like grip Merlin started mumbling words, incomprehensible to Morgana but she recognised them as very old &ndash; ancient.&nbsp;They held such power and pushed all other sounds away.</p><p>&nbsp;The market, the cries for help and the clunking sound of more soldiers arriving &ndash; all of this faded away as Merlin continued.&nbsp;His voice rose in cadence and become more tuned, song-like and Morgana could not help but wonder if he could sing like this normally.&nbsp;As she watched Arthur&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly as he felt the power flowing from Merlin and into him.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You can do it Merlin,&rdquo; whispered Gwen.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can heal him.&rdquo;&nbsp;Her face was so full of hope, so trusting in the man that Morgana knew she secretly loved.&nbsp;Morgana wanted to scream out, to tell Gwen that Merlin was <i>not</i> healing Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;What he was doing had not been done in any myth or story but Morgana had known the instant she gave him her power.&nbsp;The world around them slowed to a crawl and even the slight wind around them seemed to trickle across like a slow moving snail.&nbsp;Morgana could even imagine, connected as she was, the heartbeats of Merlin, Arthur and herself.&nbsp;Hers remained fast and strong but both Arthur&rsquo;s and Merlin&rsquo;s became the same and slowed, getting weaker every moment.</p><p>&nbsp;A shadow moved above Merlin and Morgana looked up; it was Uther, sword in hand and preparing to strike Merlin.&nbsp;Her lips could not form words and she knew that they would be useless anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;The world suddenly went a blinding white and she feinted away.</p><p>&nbsp;<u>Camelot</u>: <u>Inside the Northern Gate</u></p><p>&nbsp;Staring into those golden glowing eyes Arthur had never realised what it was to trust in someone so completely and utterly.&nbsp;Merlin would save him, of course he would.&nbsp;Hadn&rsquo;t he always and had not Arthur done the same?</p><p>&nbsp;This boy, this man that had become such an integral part of his life that it was hard to remember a time before nor life without the dark haired clumsy and smart-mouthed person that had captured not just his heart but he was fairly sure a part of his soul.&nbsp;Of course, being himself Arthur had not fully grasped this until the bolt had punctured his chest and he felt life slipping away.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Merlin.&rdquo;&nbsp;He tried so hard to convey all that he was feeling and all he wanted to say in that one name.&nbsp;A slight twitch at the corner of Merlin&rsquo;s mouth let him know that he had been somewhat successful.&nbsp;Arthur could feel Merlin&rsquo;s hand, so different to his own but strong and calloused, a workers hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your hand feels nice, warm.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Arthur, I need you to concentrate on my voice &ndash; block out everything but the sound of my voice.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Easy, thought Arthur.&nbsp;Listening to Merlin had become second nature.&nbsp;The way he always made &lsquo;sire&rsquo; sound like a curse in private but so formal in public.&nbsp;The way he said &lsquo;Arthur&rsquo; when they were alone at night, letting the Prince know that he was talking with a friend and not a servant.&nbsp;At those times Arthur could tell Merlin anything, well almost anything; his fears, hopes &ndash; his anger at Uther and his sorrow at never knowing his mother.</p><p>&nbsp;Merlin&rsquo;s footsteps, light but never soundless.&nbsp;His breathing, especially when asleep &ndash; how had Arthur never truly wondered why he would listen to Merlin sleeping?&nbsp;Merlin&rsquo;s laugh &ndash; the memory of that made Arthur smile a little more as he listened to the gentle ballad Merlin was singing.&nbsp;He did not understand a single word but Merlin had said listen, so listen he would.</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Merlin&rsquo;s eyes now blazed gold and were shot through with slivers of purple and azure blue.&nbsp;Eyes so beautiful Arthur knew they were the first thing he had noticed &ndash; that and those damnable funny looking ears.&nbsp;Those eyes were drawing him in, everything else was a blur and Merlin became his entire world.</span></p><p>&nbsp;He could hear, along with Merlin&rsquo;s voice, two thump-thumps &ndash; and a distant third.&nbsp;He concentrated on the two and noticed they were synchronised.&nbsp;Their hearts, joined as one &ndash; it was poetic thought Arthur, it was right.</p><p>&nbsp;It was fate.</p><p>&nbsp;<i>Two halves of the same coin </i>whispered Merlin&rsquo;s voice in his head.</p><p>&nbsp;<i>I never truly understood that meaning until today</i></p><p>&nbsp;<i>You are a prat and a royal one</i></p><p><i>But&hellip;</i></p><p>&nbsp;<i>I love you Arthur Pendragon</i></p><p>&nbsp;Arthur wanted to respond, to say the same but he could not move.&nbsp;His body, his will and his very soul were being consumed by those fiery eyes.&nbsp;He was lost to them and the entirety of his existence became, for just that split moment, shared - he was Merlin and Merlin was him.&nbsp;Then, like boats in the river they passed by and he was himself again.</p><p>&nbsp;Whole, able to move and feel and talk.</p><p>&nbsp;Able to see.&nbsp;A shadow fell across him and he automatically looked up to find Uther with sword raised &ndash; the sword cluttered to the ground as Uther recognised him and Arthur, was for one blessed moment, confused.</p><p>&nbsp;Then, it all made sense and he spun around to see the body beneath him, his hand clasped firmly in the other.</p><p>&nbsp;There was screaming and shouting and Arthur realised as he looked through salty tears at Merlin lying with blood on his mouth and a bolt in his chest;</p><p>&nbsp;<i>that all those screams were his own</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;The end?<br /><br />check out the sequal: <a href=""http://ashtakra.livejournal.com/20136.html"">Tread the Precipice</a><br /><br />For other fics by author:&nbsp;

with such purpose and a dangerous gait.</p><p>&nbsp;He should have guessed they&rsquo;d have guards; it was surprising it had taken so long.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, looks like you need a hand?&rdquo;&nbsp;The face entered his vision and Lorne-Nox could only let his mouth drop in wonder.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ronon?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Drones depleted sir, minimal damage.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne swore loudly on the open radio but no-one said anything; they all felt the same.&nbsp;In front of them the dish shimmered a dangerous green as the radiation built to lethal levels, ready to spew down on a defenceless Atlantis.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he announced, decision made.&nbsp;&ldquo;Pull back ten thousand meters, then come about and in formation we engage engines at maximum, divert all power including life-support.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;It was a testament to his pilots that not one questioned the order &ndash; even though it was a command for a suicide run.&nbsp;Lorne simply had little choice &ndash; drones weren&rsquo;t strong enough but a dozen puddlejumpers just might have enough kinetic energy to take the dish out.</p><p>&nbsp;They were, he figured, Atlantis&rsquo; only hope.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Kellerax-Six roared in pain as Sharmilla-Joth burned his middle face, the flesh scouring away to his ultra-thick skull.</p><p>&nbsp;He spun to present her another face.&nbsp;Part of him wanted to give in but he knew that the longer he kept her busy the better chance his plans may yet work.</p><p>&nbsp;He had lived for so very long and knew that sometimes the impossible really could happen.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon easily lifted Lorne-Nox and carried him the remaining distance to the sarcophagus.&nbsp;He needed no instructions as the target was obvious, it was the only thing in the room that was illuminated.&nbsp;The top slid back on his approach revealing a chamber just the right size for one humanoid body.</p><p>&nbsp;He hesitated for only a moment and hugged the body close to him, fearing that death had already come.&nbsp;Lorne-Nox was cold and it was hard to believe that any blood remained so pale and blue was his lips.&nbsp;Regardless Ronon lay him down and tenderly kissed those very same lips &ndash; he couldn&rsquo;t be sure but it looked like a little smile flitted across Lorne-Nox&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&nbsp;Standing back as the lid slid shut Ronon folded his arms and waited.</p><p>&nbsp;What else was left to do?</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;The Integration was vast and seemingly endless, yet existed in a thin stream of sub-space that most intelligent beings would deny even the existence of.&nbsp;Into this stream of hundreds of millions of sentient minds a tiny pin drop of consciousness threaded into the flow.&nbsp;Like ripples in a pond the consciousness spread, finding like-minds and activating dormant souls &ndash; some had not bothered to be aware for millions of years.</p><p>&nbsp;But this was something new, something exciting and the entire Pi Covenant began to take notice.</p><p>&nbsp;Nox opened eyes that didn&rsquo;t really exist and looked out.&nbsp;The soft rolling hills of a Pi-Antikos savannah was before him and upon that land a million copies of himself stared blankly at him.&nbsp;They were identical in every physical sense and they wore nothing but expressions of expectation.&nbsp;The flesh and blood of their bodies awaited nothing more simple than the base program to give them purpose.</p><p>He was that program.</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne-Nox soaked in the bio-matrix energy of the sarcophagus until his flesh literally crawled with it.&nbsp;His mesh tattoos glowed softly then burst into the full spectrum, visible light, ultra-violet and deadly x-rays.&nbsp;Had the lid not been shut Ronon would have been blinded then irradiated.&nbsp;Lorne-Nox's blue eyes turned a blinding white before shooting streams of energy hotter than the surface of the sun through the sarcophagus.&nbsp;The beams hit the ceiling two kilometres up in a nano-second and split, each stream branching out again and again in search of a target.</p><p>The army of clones was that target.</p><p>In less time than it took Ronon to blink rays illuminated the rest of the room revealing thousands of soldiers, each inert and standing like sentinels.&nbsp;The effect lasted for bare moments before the beams were extinguished.</p><p>The entity now presiding as Lorne-Nox surveyed his people.</p><p>&nbsp;[<i>see what I see</i>]</p><p>&nbsp;and they did:</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon</p><p>&nbsp;Sheppard</p><p>&nbsp;McKay</p><p>&nbsp;Cadman</p><p>&nbsp;Parrish</p><p>&nbsp;Radek</p><p>&nbsp;Keller</p><p>&nbsp;Atlantis;</p><p>&nbsp;Earth</p><p>&nbsp;[<i>Feel what I feel</i>]</p><p>&nbsp;Anger</p><p>&nbsp;Fear</p><p>&nbsp;Resentment</p><p>&nbsp;Acceptance</p><p>&nbsp;Friendship</p><p>&nbsp;Protection</p><p>&nbsp;Love</p><p>&nbsp;Loyalty</p><p>&nbsp;One after one, then by the tens and hundreds and thousands the soldiers standing in their dark lines opened their eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;This knowledge <i>He</i> had given them &ndash; it must be shared.</p><p>&nbsp;In the pitch black rooms across Pi-Antikos dots of blue flared up as systems came on-line and electric blue eyes glowed softly.&nbsp;Their mesh-tattoos glowed a myriad of gold and bronze and in each and every soldier an imprint of the original program was copied and passed on and back into the Pi Covenant.</p><p>&nbsp;For why have an army unless they were linked to the very thing that should control them.</p><p>&nbsp;In that thin stream of sub-space the being formerly known as Lorne-Nox felt his brothers come alive and using their numbers he pushed his essence into the very heart of the Covenant.</p><p>At the same moment Ronon pushed back the lid and stared down at the empty and scorched interior.&nbsp;His face wore both the pain of loss and understanding of victory.</p><p>&nbsp;[<i>Integration complete</i>]</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Kellerax-Six felt the new presence in the Integration and his remaining functioning face visibly relaxed.</p><p>&nbsp;Whatever he had started had taken hold.&nbsp;Death was now an acceptable option.</p><p>&nbsp;Staring at Sharmilla-Joth who stood before him with a sudden shocked expression on her face he felt her pain.&nbsp;All her plans, her slow mechanisations to turn the Covenant to her will &ndash; it was beginning to unravel.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Pi-Covenant will never be your plaything again,&rdquo; he intoned and approached her.&nbsp;She hesitated as he came within a step and it cost her life.&nbsp;Like a insect casting off a husk Kellerax-Six folded out and around; each face now separate and connected only by a side on each.&nbsp;The two ends faces met up effectively boxing Sharmilla-Joth in a triangle of himself; massive toothy fangs in every direction.&nbsp;He then started to constrict; the ancient Pi-Anterions had evolved a truly unique snare ability and it was being used for the first time in millions of years.</p><p>The last thing Sharmilla-Joth saw was the ruined face and scorched bare bone of Kellerax-Six, his enraged eyes told her that this was well and truly the end.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne was a moment away from firing thrusters when something stayed him.&nbsp;It was as if a millions voices called his name; a million like-minds caressing his soul.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he commanded the fleet. &nbsp;It was not a word or an image but simply a feeling.</p><p>&nbsp;Everything was going to be alright.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Pull back,&rdquo; he ordered.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re about to see something unique.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; one of the pilots finally questioned.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Just trust me,&rdquo; he answered and smiled.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon stood before a hundred soldiers, all wearing the hopeful face and expression of one Major Evan Lorne.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Ronon grinned.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great offer but there&rsquo;s only one I need.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;It was an easy choice really but seeing a hundred men with looks of disappointment was certainly an ego boost.&nbsp;Ronon walked over to the rings and pressed the device he had earlier taken from Cadman &ndash; he really hoped it worked both ways.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Only minutes ago night had fallen and the command team could quite clearly see Pi Antikos sitting in the sky, its dark panels reflecting the star&rsquo;s light from the other side of the planet.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We should be dead,&rdquo; said McKay, probably not realising he&rsquo;d said it so loud.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; said Chuck, smiling and holding a radio to his ear.&nbsp;&ldquo;Major Lorne says to look up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;They already were so all saw the panels begin to flare in gusts of white-blue energy.&nbsp;It was like watching a thousand camp-fires flare in a soft haze, each one combining with the one next to it.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; exclaimed McKay, knowledge lighting up his features.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re entering hyper-space.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Its too big,&rdquo; argued someone.&nbsp;&ldquo;A window that size will destroy the entire system.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; countered McKay.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not one window &ndash; thousands.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;It was true.&nbsp;Around the world-ship&rsquo;s outer-plating hyper-space windows opened up and in a sudden bright flash the entire of Pi-Antikos shifted like some kaleidoscope, great shafts and chunks of it disappearing into each and every blue sparkling window.&nbsp;The planet literally shattered and was eaten by the windows, but it was ordered &ndash; constructed that way.</p><p>&nbsp;In seconds all that was left was empty space once again.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;A shimmering next to his seat made Lorne turn and he should have been surprised but wasn&rsquo;t to see Ronon suddenly there.</p><p>&nbsp;He looked into his eyes and saw that whatever Ronon had experienced was something they might one-day discuss, but not today.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey there,&rdquo; he whispered and setting the ship on auto he did not hesitate to move over and sit in Ronon&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp;Running hands over the short hair he grinned and moved closer; waiting a breath from Ronon&rsquo;s lips before he saw the darkness of desire enter the bigger man&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;He kissed him, deeply and passionately and with all the love and desire he could muster.&nbsp;The taste was all he remembered, the texture of an unshaven chin and powerful jaw bringing everything back.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Its been far too long,&rdquo; murmured Lorne and nipped at Ronon&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>&nbsp;In response Ronon gripped Lorne by his hips and spun the chair around, lifting them up and shoving Lorne down to the floor, encompassing him with his larger frame.&nbsp;As Lorne&rsquo;s erection dug into Ronon&rsquo;s thigh the Satedan gave a feral grin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Definitely the right one.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Four Weeks Later&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;On the balcony the couple watched as another beam was welded into place, the sparks quite spectacular in the crisp night air.&nbsp;As the fallout from the attack on the planet continued the weather had become about ten degrees colder.&nbsp;Most of the science team agreed the planet would be unliveable within six months; they hoped to have a new ZPM by then.</p><p>&nbsp;Leaning in to his companion Lorne clinked their glasses together and he resisted purring when Ronon&rsquo;s free hand snaked around his ribs.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So?&rdquo; rumbled the Satedan.&nbsp;&ldquo;You ready to do this?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Waiting just long enough for Ronon to get twitchy Lorne finally nodded.&nbsp;&ldquo;It has to be done &ndash; completely unavoidable.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Not completely.&rdquo;&nbsp;Lorne knew what he meant.&nbsp;If he asked, and maybe even if he didn&rsquo;t Ronon would have taken them out of here and to who knows where.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Luckily,&rdquo; said Lorne.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sheppard has our back, so it shouldn&rsquo;t go so bad &ndash; but just in case I have a puddlejumper ready to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;A knock on the door interrupted them and Lorne groaned.&nbsp;&ldquo;Its too soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Ronon gruffly.&nbsp;&ldquo;You not ready for this?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lorne said quickly and spun to face him.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am so very ready &ndash; just a little scared.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon huffed and stifled a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne looked at him sternly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Woolsey organised this you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You should have more faith in the little man, he&rsquo;s not so bad once you get to know him.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;It was Lorne&rsquo;s turn to snort.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now I know this is a dream.&rdquo;&nbsp;Another knock stopped Ronon&rsquo;s answer and they went to the door.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon opened the door and Sheppard straightened, his dress uniform looking both impressive and strange on the usually casual Colonel.&nbsp;Next to him was McKay, also dressed formerly for the occasion.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You folks ready?&rdquo;&nbsp;His language belied the seriousness of the situation and Lorne and Ronon just nodded.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;&nbsp;He cocked a self-effaced smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;As per protocol we&rsquo;re here to escort you &ndash; Ronon gets McKay since he should be easy to escape from if the big guy feels the need.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And you sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Sheppard in answer just took Lorne&rsquo;s elbow and directed him down the corridor.&nbsp;&ldquo;No escape for you Major.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Stopping outside command the four hesitated and Sheppard gave Lorne and Ronon a final nod.&nbsp;&ldquo;Last chance?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The couple looked at each other and Ronon reached out and clasped Lorne&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in this together.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The doors opened and they trooped in.&nbsp;Standing before the Stargate was all of the command staff and perhaps most of anyone in Atlantis who was free and could fit in the room.&nbsp;Woolsey and Teyla stood centre point, with Cadman in full uniform dress snapping to attention.&nbsp;At her direction so did the honour guard that Lorne and Ronon walked past following McKay and Sheppard.</p><p>&nbsp;At the foot of the Stargate Teyla smiled at them both and clasped her hands in front.&nbsp;&ldquo;I believe I must start with the words&hellip; Dearly Beloved.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The End.</p><p><em>Thankyou to everyone who has been on the journey.&nbsp; I did give this a bit of a re-write but nothing major was changed.&nbsp;</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p></lj-cut><br />&nbsp;"

no glowing blue eyes and best of all no gaping wounds.&nbsp;No injuries of any kind apparently and also strong and getting stronger every second.&nbsp;Lorne&rsquo;s eyes had widened on seeing Ronon, an expression Ronon knew to be happiness but then he had stalked over and enveloped the smaller man in a hug that left no room for misinterpretation.&nbsp;Lorne had been stiff at first, not accustomed to open displays of affection but he soon returned the hug and lowered his head into Ronon&rsquo;s neck; breathing him in and sighing in satisfaction.</p><p>&nbsp;Cadman had discreetly looked away; Sheppard had rolled his eyes and McKay had snorted before going to check on Atlantis.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Ronon whispered simply in Lorne&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne leaned back and gave him an unreadable expression, then smiled warmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I &ndash; what?&nbsp;Well&hellip; I love you too.&rdquo;&nbsp;He hesitated a&nbsp;moment before pressing his lips to Ronon&rsquo;s, his way had always been a little more aggressive but never before in public.</p><p>&nbsp;Once he had breath again Ronon grinned.&nbsp;&ldquo;Being dead has improved your technique.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;&nbsp;Lorne looked to Sheppard who had just sent Cadman to check on casualties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The Colonel shrugged.&nbsp;&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t really have time to fill you in on everything, its been awhile and yes, we all missed you and its great to have you back, and I&rsquo;m sure you two,&rdquo; he coughed and looked embarrassed for a moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well you have some catching up to do but right now we&rsquo;re kind of in the middle of something and I&rsquo;m looking for ideas.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What seems to be the problem, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp;In response Sheppard took him and led him to the closest balcony.&nbsp;What he saw made Lorne hiss in surprise.&nbsp;Atlantis was on land!&nbsp;Not just on land but kind of wedged into a valley with great jutting mountains behind them.&nbsp;Looking up Lorne swore loudly as he spotted the world ship.&nbsp;Even in daylight the giant orb was visible with its black panels and immense size compared to the moon, which was also in the sky but broken in half.</p><p>&nbsp;That, combined with everything that had just happened; being woken and removed from a sarcophagus then transported here using ring technology, told him the shit this time was deep.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t fly?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; answered McKay, joining them.&nbsp;&ldquo;Barely enough power for sensors, no shield and definitely no flight capability&hellip; and I just detected something worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;What could be worse?&rdquo; said Sheppard.</p><p>&nbsp;McKay wrung his hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;There is radiation build-up on the world-ships north pole &ndash; radiation that will kill any living thing in moments.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; enthused Ronon.&nbsp;&ldquo;So they&rsquo;ll fry themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered McKay.&nbsp;&ldquo;It seems contained in a dish that&rsquo;s pointed this way &ndash; I would conclude they&rsquo;re giving up trying to get what they need while we&rsquo;re still on Atlantis and are just going to wipe us out.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Time?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Unknown,&rdquo; answered McKay to Sheppard&rsquo;s question.&nbsp;&ldquo;But soon if the build-up is anything to go by.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Then we need to get out of here now,&rdquo; said Lorne and was greeted by three sets of eyes giving him the idiot look.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he tried to defend his words.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away remember, give a guy a break.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;McKay clicked his fingers.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it &ndash; we all have to leave, no no &ndash; here me out,&rdquo; he interrupted himself before anyone could argue.&nbsp;&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want Atlantis destroyed, just us gone so they can access the database.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Sheppard groaned loudly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I would happily accommodate them if the stargate was working but there&rsquo;s no way off Atlantis without it.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on land,&rdquo; stated Ronon.&nbsp;&ldquo;We can just walk away.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; muttered Sheppard.&nbsp;&ldquo;I considered that &ndash; but they&rsquo;re on a war footing, and strategically you don&rsquo;t leave an enemy behind, especially an enemy that has the knowledge we do.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Exactly, so we have to appear to have left Atlantis.&rdquo;&nbsp;McKay looked at each of them as if it was simple.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; stated Sheppard.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I know what you&rsquo;re thinking but three problems; we don&rsquo;t have a nuke, shield and cloak&rsquo;s not working and these guys are smarter than Wraith.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Please Colonel,&rdquo; said McKay.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;d never try the same trick twice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;So what are you suggesting?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;McKay rubbed his hands together.&nbsp;&ldquo;A devious and dangerous plan that I have been toying with for a couple of years.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; sighed Lorne.&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me guess, you&rsquo;ve never tested it, whatever you&rsquo;re planning &ndash; but you are positive it will work.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said McKay in confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Three voices answered him.&nbsp;&ldquo;We know!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;It felt like he had been crawling for an eternity.&nbsp;Death seemed unwilling to take him and the same human part that made him want to say &lsquo;fuck you&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t let him give up.&nbsp;They were counting on him down in Atlantis; Ronon was counting on him.</p><p>&nbsp;With the thought of the big guy in his head Lorne-Nox made a renewed effort.&nbsp;One hand in front of the other, drag, hand out, drag.&nbsp;His legs had refused to work and that numb feeling in his hands was the result of acute shock &ndash; next stop unconsciousness, then finally death.</p><p>&nbsp;Until then, drag a bit further.</p><p>&nbsp;His hand hit something hard, a step.</p><p>&nbsp;Damnit!</p><p>&nbsp;He tried going another way but hit yet another step.&nbsp;As he did so a light flicked on illuminating this part of the room.&nbsp;It was exactly where he wanted to be, right near the sarcophagus; Lorne-Nox did not know why it was important or what it could achieve but something told him he needed to get in that machine.</p><p>&nbsp;Only problem was there were about thirty steps and he was just about out of energy.</p><p>&nbsp;With one shaking hand he tried to get a firm grip and pull himself up.</p><p>&nbsp;That was one.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Sharmilla-Joth stared around at yet another room devoid of anything but silent warriors.&nbsp;A dozen times she had tried to reach where Kellerax-Six was and each time she had been diverted; the clever three-faced sentinel had obviously sabotaged the rings.</p><p>&nbsp;[<i>Apex</i>]</p><p>&nbsp;Yes? She thought back at the integration.</p><p>&nbsp;[<i>Weapon primed</i>]</p><p>&nbsp;Then activate.</p><p>&nbsp;[<i>not necessary, Atlantis is abandoned, no lifeforms detected</i>]</p><p>&nbsp;Thinking carefully Sharmilla-Joth considered the options.&nbsp;They had disabled the stargate&rsquo;s ability to create a stable wormhole; their ships were not capable of carrying the entire population and the integration would have reported if the Atlanteans had moved to the land.&nbsp;It was a trick.</p><p>&nbsp;Activate anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;[weapon deploying]</p><p>&nbsp;She smiled and stepped into the rings again; this time she activated a different set of co-ordinates.&nbsp;Kellerax-Six was smart but his inability to think laterally was always his weakness.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The radiation is still building and we&rsquo;re about to lose all power,&rdquo; announced Chuck while holding a heavily bandaged head.</p><p>&nbsp;McKay swore loudly.&nbsp;&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re still approaching &ndash; guess it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a surprise,&rdquo; muttered Sheppard which earned him a patented Rodney death glare.</p><p>&nbsp;Woolsey, who had been attended and was now conscious sat at the steps and looked around at his command staff.&nbsp;&ldquo;Options?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We set the self-destruct, we&rsquo;ll be dead anyway but they won&rsquo;t get the database and will be stuck with an army with bad programming.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sheppard&rsquo;s announcement got a round of slow nods, all except Ronon who stood with his arms crossed.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re forgetting somebody.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Sheppard obviously understood.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nox?&nbsp;If he could have done something he would have by now.&nbsp;Also you said he was critically wounded and he &lsquo;s probably,&rdquo; he hesitated.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry big guy but he&rsquo;s probably dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting who he is.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne turned to Ronon with a strange expression.&nbsp;&ldquo;Am I missing something?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon lowered his head and ran hands over his short hair before looking Lorne in the eye.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s you &ndash; not entirely but all the best parts, and he won&rsquo;t give up.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip; me?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Ronon answered with a guilt stricken face that told Lorne all he needed to know.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; announced Lorne, turning to his commanding officer.&nbsp;&ldquo;Permission to launch the emergency puddle-jumpers; with luck we can take out the radiation emitter before they fire.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;The Colonel scratched his chin.&nbsp;&ldquo;Permission granted, get all available pilots to the launch bay; and Lorne?&nbsp;Good luck Major.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne nodded but went Ronon before leaving.&nbsp;Nothing was said as they stared at each other.&nbsp;Eventually Lorne nodded and gave a half-smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could resist a copy of me either.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Apparently their&rsquo;s millions of them,&rdquo; smiled Ronon and Lorne blanched.&nbsp;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Ronon, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle for the original.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Lorne clasped Ronon by the shoulders and let his eyes convey all the emotion of the moment, just like they used to when no-one knew about them.&nbsp;Ronon kissed the top of his head and pushed him to the door, the major left without a backward glance.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see him again,&rdquo; said Sheppard, walking up to place a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think he has a pretty good reason to return in one piece.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon frowned and checked his pistol.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gonna need help.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a pilot,&rdquo; said Sheppard in confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;And this isn&rsquo;t a ground war.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Smiling his most feral expression Ronon turned to Cadman.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not yet.&nbsp;Laura, you&rsquo;ve got something I need.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Kellerax-Six,&rdquo; said Sharmilla-Joth softly.&nbsp;The large alien turned his oldest face to her.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;If you continue on this path Apex you will destroy all that we are.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I am more concerned with what we can be my old friend &ndash; how could you betray the Covenant?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I have done nothing of the sort.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; whispered Sharmilla-Joth, raising her hand as it blazed a heated red.&nbsp;&ldquo;You always were a believer.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Half-way up the stairs Lorne-Nox slumped for the last time.&nbsp;His energy reserves were depleted, his blood pressure was too low and his vision was starting to go.</p><p>&nbsp;He simply could not make it the final steps and his chest felt another pain, not of bullet wounds but of heart-ache.&nbsp;They would all die because he had failed.</p><p>&nbsp;Ronon would die.</p><p>&nbsp;The sarcophagus seemed so close but he couldn&rsquo;t even raise a hand anymore.&nbsp;Tunnel vision set in as blackness seeped in around the edges.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he whispered to the empty room.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Lorne firmly.&nbsp;&ldquo;On my mark we de-cloak and fire every drone at the weapon; its big so missing shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;As they neared the world-ship he realised the immensity of the craft before them.&nbsp;The&nbsp;weapon was a concave dish the size of a small continent &ndash; any damage they inflicted would be inconsequential.</p><p>&nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t mean they couldn&rsquo;t try.</p><p>&nbsp;SGASGASGASGA</p><p>&nbsp;Chuck turned to the waiting command staff.&nbsp;&ldquo;The radiation has reached a critical level, I believe it will be released any second.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Woolsey spoke for all of them.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Well fuck me.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;Tbc&hellip;<br /><br /><strong>Next:&nbsp;

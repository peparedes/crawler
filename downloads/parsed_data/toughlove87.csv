"event","So yeah. Went to Ross early in the morning to pick out a bunch of shoes. Guess how many I bought!! One pair. LOL
Then I went to work.. same old, same old, I guess. There was this table with a bunch of guys sitting at it, and they came up to pay, like, 40 minutes later. One of the guys said that I had a pretty smile, and I'm like, okay. Then, there was this other guy who was flirting with me, and I'm like, Do you not see the ring on my finger?! And there was this other guy. Oh, man. This one was harlarious. He was talking about losing weight and what not, and I was like,""That's what is wrong with this generation; They base things on looks. I don't, I'm more of a personality type."" He's like,""Okay, so can I have your number?!"" UHhh.. NO!..
So yeah.. that was predominately my day.. TOday, i'm going to go shopping with Shell, Tigger and Rene. ha ha ha!!! It's going to be a blast!

"event","July 4th was okay. I went to the Chinese Association party thing at Funtastics. Met up with Garret and Kat there! It was freakin' awesome!!
But, oh geeze.. Monday morning, I had the freakiest dream. It scared that crap out of me. Okay, the phone rings at 7:45, and it was David's tutor. At around 8-10, was when this dream occured:
I'm over at Rachelle's house, but everything is different. Her room is down the hall from the dinning room, and her sister's room is right across from her room, so they were facing each other. Shell's dad is walking around checking on dinner, and Shell' mom is setting the table for a bunch of relatives to come over soon. I was over at her house, and we were just chilling in Shell's room, because her mom requested for us not to help (I accidently burnt the potatoes). So we're in her room, and all of a sudden, all the relatives decide to show up early. I remember this one huge guy. He was muscular and broad, had sandy hair, and the creepiest blue eyes I'd ever seen. Suddenly, this old rocking chair in her room begins to creak and move on its own, and that guy comes in. He smiles at Shell, and say"" hey, Rachelle.. how have you been since you FUCKING THREW ME IN JAIL?!"" I panic and grabbed a knife I keep in my pants that Rene gave me for my birthday a little while ago. Before I knew it, he pulls out a knife too, and he slams the door shut. Nobody outside heard anything in Shell's room. The scene turns deadly, and both of us were fighting to stay alive. He turns to me and says,"" Any one who defends Rachelle dies"" and tries to kill me first! It's this huge chase around the room, and I'm running like hell. Pretty soon, he corners me, and I get stabbed in the stomach. Shell screamed and her blade went into his back. He rolls and is on the floor in pain, while Shell and I stumbling out of her room. We raced to Beth's room and lock the door. He comes screaming out of her room, and still nobody outside did anything. He rams the door twice and a few more times and finally breaks it down on his last effort. He's panting, and I'm losing every bit of energy I might have had before. He looks at me, and say,"" I told you so,"" and then he whips out a gun. Rene, who was invited and came late, saw that my life and Shell's was on the line, so he jump-kicked the guy in the head. The gun goes off, and I'm hit in my arm. I'm crawling to the door, while Rene and the guy are fighting. I scream to Shell's dad, who just happened to be passing by,"" MR. MARK!!! CALL THE POLICE!"" He hears me, sees the pool of blood around me, and the steady stream of blood coming out of my mouth, and he turns to call the police. The guy notices me too late, and while I was screaming for her dad to call the police, he aimed his gun at me and fired. Rene jumped in the way and the bulllet clips him in the side and barely misses my head. Suddenly, all of the relatives are on the guy and beating the crap out of him. Everything is a blur and I pass out for a few moments. When i woke up, I was the hospital and Rene was by my bedside. I had a platinum diamond ring on my left hand ring finger. I got up and asked Rene, and he said,"" I honestly love you. It's to show how much we've gone through, and how I'm so glad that you are alive."" We kissed and then I asked,"" Where's Rachelle?! Is she okay?!"" Turns out, she made it out of the fight better than I did. She came to visit me, because I was prohibited to leave the room, and we were being guarded (a huge body guard named Desmoth was hired to stay at the doorway of my hospital room). The guard then was instructed to keep her and Tigger (Shell's boyfriend) in the room with me and Rene. NONE of us were allowed to leave.All of a sudden, that guy breaks Desmoth's neck, and he storms into my room. He was a complete mess, his arm was broken and the bone was going through the skin, his eye was bleeding from the corners, the knife Shell stuck in his back earlier was still in, Rene used my blade earlier to get him in the heart, but he missed, and the blade was still there. He was staggering and spitting blood, while yelling at me,"" YOu fucking bitch.. why the fuck did you do that? if you fucking stayed out of it..."" Then, there was a sea of red and blue lights, and we suddenly became hostages. He whips out a gun, and tells Rene, Shell and Tigger to go into the corner. Any wrong move by them would have result in my getting a bullet in the head. He turns to Shell and said,"" Now, I'll show you what happens to the people who defended you. "" He attempts to rape me, and Rene and Tigger get pissed off as hell. Shell quietly pulls out a small 22 milimeter gun, took a dead aim at his head and fired... I don't know how it happened... but she missed and hit me and I flatlined. and then the phone rings and I wake up. (end of dream)
The phone was ringing, and my arms were crossed on my chest. I was like, oh geeze... man.. that was freaky..
I emailed Rachelle about it, and then I talked on the phone to her about it too. She then talked about Tigger, and how she wished that he would have a serious conversation with her sometimes. After I talked to her, I called Rene, and it was a brief and basic conversation. I got off the phone a few seconds later, and then he calls back and order me to get online (I folded so easily). So we get online, and we talked about a bunch of really random things. At one point, I typed,"" How long to you think we'll last?"" 
""no idea. but, I don't intend on breaking up anytime soon, do you."" -Rene.
""No, i don't either. It's just, i was thinking about something you said."" -Me
""what?"" -Rene
""Oh, was i suuposed to explain?"" -me
""yep.""
""Ok, well, that wednesday night, you said that you couldn't wait until you were 18, and then move out, right?""
""Yeah""
""Well, then you said that I could come over without worrying about your mom, right?""
""yeah, you're right.""
""Well, I thought about our conversation a few nights ago, and it struck me that you turning 18 was a year away that you thought that we would stay toegther for that long. Don't get me wrong. I want that to happen.."" (this first part of the conversation, I lost, so it was from memory, Gilgothdae is Rene).
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:02 PM]:  i want that to happen.. 
Gilgothdae [2:03 PM]:  but you didn't think it would last that long? 
Gilgothdae [2:03 PM]:  or the idea bothers you? 
Gilgothdae [2:03 PM]:  what I don't see where your going with this 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:03 PM]:  I do this it would happen. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:03 PM]:  *think 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:03 PM]:  I DO THINK THAT IT WILL HAPPEN. I do think that we can stay together for well over a year.. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:04 PM]:  there's no way i can explain without giving you the entire story 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:04 PM]:  do you want the entire story? 
Gilgothdae [2:04 PM]:  sure 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:05 PM]:  okay... i remember on one seperate occasion, you wanted me to stay here in tucson with you after I graduated. (wait, let me finish before responding) 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:05 PM]:  I talked to Rachelle about what you said then and that one wednesday night. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:06 PM]:  i thought that you might have been afraid of commitment at one point, so I told her that.. but then i started thinking about what i was saying. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:06 PM]:  You never were the one to be afraid. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:06 PM]:  you never told me that you were afriad of commitment, i just assumed....  
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:06 PM]:  but, truth it 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:06 PM]:  *is 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:07 PM]:  you weren't the one afraid.. i was. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:07 PM]:  I'm afraid of you being too good to be true. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:07 PM]:  how in the world did I find a guy who so affectionate, cares about what I think and feel, and isn't afraid to tell me that he wants to stay with me for a while?  
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:08 PM]:  i was afraid of everything i'm feeling right now, because i've felt it before, and was decieved horribly. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:09 PM]:  I'm afraif that i'm falling in too fast with this relationship because of all the things i'm feeling for you right now, and I'm afraid that if i voice them, you'll leave me, and i'll be worse off then before. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:09 PM]:  I really want us to stay together.. for over a year, or even longer.. I would absoluetely love that 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:09 PM]:  i just... 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:10 PM]:  *sigh* i don't know. 
Gilgothdae [2:10 PM]:  well let me tell you something...I will be more than happy to be together for the rest of the time I'm in tucson...but as soon as I get my shipping orders...that is when I break it off 
Gilgothdae [2:10 PM]:  and I want to make sure you remember that 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:10 PM]:  i know that. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:11 PM]:  that's why i was afraid of telling you how I felt 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:11 PM]:  because it'll just come right back to the enevitable. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:11 PM]:  it always does. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:12 PM]:  see? i keep remembering that, and then i feel that everything i'm feeling right now is just not right.. like, i've been tricked or something, except i know that I""m not. I really am falling for you, and i'm afraid that i'm taking this way too seriously than you meant for it to. 
Gilgothdae [2:14 PM]:  I feel the same...I trully do...but it may sound selfish, but that won't stop me from joining up...and I don't want to drag you into the military life 
Gilgothdae [2:15 PM]:  I think  you would hate movin around so much and plus me always worryin about what would happen to you if I was K.I.A. 
Gilgothdae [2:15 PM]:  I couldn't live with that thought
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:16 PM]:  iono... I want to voice that i might be in love.. but.. i just can't bring myself to say something like that, especially since the last time i said it, again, it was probably the biggest mistake I'd ever made then. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:16 PM]:  i don't know what i'm feeling for you 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:17 PM]:  i don't want you to think at all that I'm trying to stop you from entering the services or anything like that. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:17 PM]:  because i'm not. 
Gilgothdae [2:17 PM]:  I'll say this...I think I have fallen in love...but it is such a powerful thing that I refuse to say it till I am certain 
Gilgothdae [2:17 PM]:  that is why I havn't said it 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:18 PM]:  i'm not looking for you to say it... that's not the purpose of our conversation right now at all. 
Gilgothdae [2:18 PM]:  not because I don't just maily because it is such a special thing that I won't  
Gilgothdae [2:18 PM]:  I know 
Gilgothdae [2:18 PM]:  I'm just stating why I don't say it, no matter whether I think I do 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:19 PM]:  and i'm stating that this purpose of this conversation was not to get you to say that you love me. I can't even be certain that i love you... in fact, i know i'm not certain about that at all.. the purpose was to get your thinking and your perspective about our relationship, and to tell you that I was afraid of falling for you. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:19 PM]:  i still am 
Gilgothdae [2:20 PM]:  I understand 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:20 PM]:  but, now that i've voiced this with you, and have gotten your side, i'm not so much afraid anymore. 
Gilgothdae [2:20 PM]:  so if you want things to slow down that is fine 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:20 PM]:  that's also not what I'm saying.  
Gilgothdae [2:20 PM]:  ok 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:22 PM]:  I'm just saying that I was afraid to believe that you were too good to be true. It seems so uncanny that the guy everyone told me rumors of turned out to be the one type of guy that i spent most of my time looking for. But, again, now that i've voiced this with you, and now that you understand a little bit, i'm not so much afraid of a future with you, like i was before.  Before, i was afraid of what i was feeling, and I was afraid that everything i was feeling would come to a screeching halt, but... 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:22 PM]:  it's more than evident that it's not going to. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:22 PM]:  not anytime too. 
Gilgothdae [2:22 PM]:  :) kisses :)
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:23 PM]:  *kisses* 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:23 PM]:  thank you for listening.. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:23 PM]:  or reading.. whatever.. 
Gilgothdae [2:23 PM]:  anytime 
Gilgothdae [2:23 PM]:  hehe 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:23 PM]:  i would like an opinion. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:23 PM]:  what do you think? 
Gilgothdae [2:24 PM]:  umm...not sure what you mean but I think that it is a resonable concern 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:24 PM]:  reasonable concern? 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:25 PM]:  i'm not following.. at all.
Gilgothdae [2:25 PM]:  well I wouldn;t want you to just blindly fall for me 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:25 PM]:  umm.. no. 
Gilgothdae [2:25 PM]:  people that think are good 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:25 PM]:  it took me three months to fall for you. 
Gilgothdae [2:25 PM]:  so it is a resonable thing to be thinking about 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:26 PM]:  you thought i blindly fell for you? 
Gilgothdae [2:26 PM]:  no 
Gilgothdae [2:27 PM]:  I am saying I am glad you DIDN'T
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:27 PM]:  ahh ok. 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:27 PM]:  i just meant, what's your opinion about your relationship, seeing as i just voiced mine. 
Gilgothdae [2:27 PM]:  oh 
Gilgothdae [2:28 PM]:  well... 
Gilgothdae [2:28 PM]:  it certainly is nearly perfect 
Gilgothdae [2:28 PM]:  except for the whoel parent issue 
Gilgothdae [2:28 PM]:  I'd say I have all I ever wanted with you :) 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:29 PM]:  :-D 
XXxchopstixsxXx [2:29 PM]:  i have no idea how to respond.. i'm floored right now.. 
Gilgothdae [2:29 PM]:  :tons of kisses: and a nice long one to finish them off
(end of IM conversation)
So yeah. It was actually a serious conversation that we had and I'm no longer afraid. I'm kind likeing this now. :-D
Anyways, that will end my heinously long entry... ciao!

"event","So I get online and the very first person who bothered to take the time to IM me was PJ (so sweet, that guy is!). So yeah. I guess right as this moment now, he's reading my live journal, and he signed up too! I can't wait for his first entry! lol!
So, today. Today was really hectic. My parents and grandparents were cleaning endlessly (for reasons, I will not disclose) and I was exhausted. I started doing pilates again, and for some reason, it has taken a lot out of me than it should have. Oh well, I'm going to continue to do them and hopefully, it'll be a little better.
Tanya came back from the Phillipines a little while ago. She had a blast and can't believe she's back in triple digit weather here.. man, this place blows.. LOL!
SO yeah. Had plans with Rene on Wednesday and Thursday, but that just didn't seem to be working. Everybody and everything just suddenly shifted and now, everybody has just something stupid thing that they need to do. The more I try to see this guy, the further I get from seeing him! It's horrible!
Alot more people responded to my flame thread on Acad. than I thought. Granted, the topic shifted completely from flaming me to politics, but it's totally okay! Wow, it was just a shock to see that I'm offline for a few days, and everybody else is active.. LOL!
Anywho.. well, I think that will do it for me now. Oh, I was driving my grandmother home a few minutes ago, and I suddenly realized that three generations sat in the same car with me. Eight years ago, my mother was holding me and my grandmother was driving. Now, I'm the one driving my grandmother.. god, she and my mother are so awesome people....

"event","I, at this time, haven't talked to Rene for quite some time. I called him twice the day before, but both times, i got the answering machine, so I figured that he didn't want to talk, so I didn't pursue it.
Anyways, well.. that day turned out to be one of the worst I have had in a while. People were bitching at me for the buffet, and taking it all out of me. I almost collapsed because of sleep deprivation and hunger (both on my part of staying up too late online and not feeling like eating anything), so I was getting a bunch of lectures from everybody. I kind of promised myself that I wouldn't call him just because I didn't want to make it seem like I was desperate or anything, but right at the moment, when I was feeling the worse, I needed to hear Rene's voice more than ever. So, I gave in and called him. He was driving, but continued to talk to me anyways. He told me that the both times I called, he was away. The first time, he was at the trainer's getting his dog, and the second time.. I forgot his reason for that.. hm. Oh well, he then told me that he waited all night for me to call him back, assuming that I would, because I already called him twice. When I didn't, he got disappointed and went to sleep. He also told me that if I continued to not sleep and eat, he would lecture me way more than everybody else. Well, he told me to call him back whenever I get home, so at around 10:30, I did. We talked about alot and college came up again. I was wondering where I should go out of high school. He said,"" oh yeah. You have only one year left, and if you leave.. ohh."" That ""ohh"" was followed by a disappointed sigh, and i asked,"" Are you implying what I thinking you're implying?"" He asked for my reasoning, and I said,"" That you want me to stay in Tucson...""
""Yeah, I want you to stay here... with me."" -Rene.
I had no idea what to say after that.. I was shocked and floored completely. This comment shocked me even more than him wanting to move in with me. LOL.
WEDNESDAY, the 23rd: THIRD MONTH ANNIVERSARY WITH RENE. WEll, I spent the day working again, and the lovely Diane  requested that me and my mom show up at her house for her birthday party. Well.. imagine our surprise when the b-day girl wasn't even there!!! LOL!
THURSDAY, the 24th: I went to go look at my senior pictures and a few of them turned out okay. :-D yee-haw.."

"event","yesterday was spent working the night shift. I came home around 10:30-ish, when online really quickly at around 11:30, and called Rene at around 11:50.. he was driving (oops!) so i told him to call me back. It was around 12:30 and i thought he would never call me back, so i slipped a little bit into sleep-mode. The phone rings shrilly, and i awake and answered it. HA HA HA! it was Rene and i was happy. we talked for until almost 1, which was a half hour phone conversation. He hated talking on the phone, so whatever time i get with him means something.. ha ha ha! :-D 
i eventually went to bed at around 1:30 and my mom woke us (me david and Brian) up around 9 ish. She dropped us off at the old house and from 10-2, we moved cinder blocks form the old house to the new house. It was a lot of really hard work (particularily or David because he moves them two at a time) and the weather outside wasn't helping at all! freakin' triple digit weather outside!!! arg!! After those lovely hours of work, i woulnd up getting a lot of exercise, scrapes, bruises, and some internal bleeding. Fun stuff.
So yeah.. now i am going off to call Rene again, hee hee!, and i will update more later. ciao!"

"event","soo.. i have just realized how much my summer is going to suck.. it's great really... >:-(
So my uncle is leaving for China on Wednesday and he won't be back until July 17th. Then, i will only have a week to be able to spend time with Rene (my boyfriend), Rachelle (one of my two best friends), Tanya (the 2nd best friend), and possibly Diane (a kick ass cousin), who i believe is leaving for Seattle and Oregon during a good part of August. Then, during the last week of July, my mom was planning on maybe going to L.A. for a few days.My mother wanted to keep this confidental for the moment, because she doesn't want my dad to tell my Unlce Jack that we might be visiting.. because.. well.. she doesn't like Uncle Jack very much.. and i don't feel like seeing them.. so yeah.. SHH!! the world must not find out about us going to L.A.!
Then, after a few days in L.A., i won't be able to see anybody simply because they all have plans. The first week of August will most likely be spent on volleyball camp, and registration for David. The week after that, it'll be registration for me and buying school supplies. The week after that, school starts.. Lovely. i get almost no time at all to spend with the people i care about the most! ARG!!!!!!! >:-( very very very angry right now...
before this entry takes another depressing turn, i recently found out that my parents are thinking about letting me get my liscense and maybe the prospect of owning a car isn't too far off into the future.. yay.
i will now close this entry with a few good quotes.

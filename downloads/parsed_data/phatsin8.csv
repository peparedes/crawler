Oh yes!  

My very first car was a 1992 Oldsmobile Achieva which I named Trooper because I was not at all a good driver and I put that car through a lot.  

My second car (after totaling Trooper) was a 1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera which I named Gilbert because the first night I drove it it broke down on Gilbert Rd.  The car was hilarious because the drivers seat was stuck in the reclined position so I looked like a total hood while I was driving it because I had to lean to the side to see out the windshield.  I had mardi gras beads hanging from the rearview and I put tiger stripped seat covers in it...it was pretty awesome.

My third car was a 1990 Chrysler Lebaron convertible which I named Sexy because, well, it was pretty damn sexy ;)

My fourth car was a 2002 Ford Focus named Gary because it reminded me of Spongebob's pet snail by the same name.

My current car is a 2008 Honda Pilot which I have named Betty, because she's black and she's badass so I named her after the song Black Betty by Ram Jam."

So this year I am being forced, yes FORCED, to dress up.  Not for Trick or Treat or some Halloween party mind you but for my District Training Meeting on October 14th.  You may wonder why this is so terrible...you might even now be saying to yourself, ""wow, what a @#$ing whiner! I wish I got to dress up for my company meetings!  That sounds like fun!"" Well it isn't and you're all kinds of wrong.  Here's why:

1.  My training meeting is in KY which is roughly a 3 hour car trip from where I live.  This means that I either have to ride to the meeting in my costume for 3 godforsaken hours or wait until I get to my bosses house (yes, we have it at his freaking house) to change into said costume.

2.  We have to wear the costume for the entire day of the meeting.  This means that whatever I'm dressing as has to be A. comfortable and B. require NO make-up

3.  This is an actual meeting with my boss and my peers, OH! and a visitor from our corporate offices (who is also being forces to wear a costume) to boot, which means that I have to be completely conservative in whatever I choose.  I am one of only three female managers in the group and by far the youngest manager by almost 10 years, one wrong move here and I will never live this down.

4.  As tempting as it would be after considering number 3 to perhaps just wear a full-head mask and something resembling a burlap sack to try and save myself as much attention as possible, I may actually have to do a presentation at this meeting, in my costume.  Oh yeah folks, the fun keeps on coming! So I must be able to see and be seen clearly and have full use of my arms and legs.

Now that I've established the horror that is going into this process let me tell you what I decided to go as....

A Candy Corn.

Harmless right?  It should be.  A white shirt, Orange skirt (maybe a petticoat), and yellow leggings.  I also found some really cute candy corn shoes online that I want to get...

Then I called one of my fellow managers today...you know, one of the male managers that is roughly 10 years older than I am and when I told him my costume idea he asked if it was going to be edible *hand to forehead* 

There is no winning.  Also, why is it that every costume available to purchase anymore only seems to come in three options?  Naked Slut, Almost Naked Slut, Slut, and Witch?  Seriously, WTF?"

The irritating part is that I went to the doctor the day BEFORE I got sick so I don't really feel like going again (especially without medical insurance at the moment).  I think today I'm going to go to CVS (I need prescriptions filled anyway) and pick up some nyquil/dayquil and some nasal spray.  

Has anyone ever seen the episode of Yes, Dear where the main character gets hooked on nasal spray?
I have only watched two episodes of that show (both were while I was eating lunch at a restaurant on Salem Ave) and that was actually a pretty funny one.  His wife ends up demanding that he stop using it and he keeps trying to sneek it into the house.  My favorite part is where the guy is dreaming that his nasal spray is beckoning him and together they frollick through a field of wildflowers.  When the guy wakes up he finds himself in a completely trashed bathroom with a tube of toothpaste up his nose.  

I haven't been as addicted to LJ lately thanks to the evils of MySpace. I actually posted a blog on there and felt like I was kind of cheating on LJ.  If any of y'all are on there (that I haven't already added) please let me know so that I can keep my internet friend base consistent;)  My last name is Laithwaite if that helps. 

So far, my favorite part of MySpace is watching the videos when I get bored, keeping up with people from The Office and So You Think You Can Dance, and reconnecting with people I went to High School with.  It is kind of alarming to find out so many people I graduated with are now married with 2-3 kids though.  Sure, there are a lot of them that are still in college or wandering kinda aimlessly but the ones with kids already...*shakes head* I guess it just runs home the fact that that is where I'm heading.  I want kids, don't get me wrong, but wow the thought is still a little terrifying at times. 

As an end thought:  can I get a heads up on who all is coming to the Halloween party and what everyone is bringing?"

"event","Sold my very first bed today at Select Comfort...almost had a heart attack.  Basically, although I've been selling for something like 10 years now, Select Comfort is very different from anything I'm used to selling.  They make the sales process seem sooo easy in the training videos and then you get on the floor and it's like herding cats.  

For example, at LA Weight Loss, when we were giving a presentation we would have the client shut away with us in an office and the client would have to listen to us and talk to us for however long we made them.  At Select Comfort, there is a clear shot to the door if someone decides they've had enough.  

One thing I'm catching on to is that most of the people who come into the store and really want to purchase a bed already know that before they come in.  For instance, a good demo is important and all but if someone has already researched it online and like how the bed feels when they get into it, they will buy it no matter what you say.  

One cool thing about where I work now is that I get to wear slippers everyday if I want.  This is HUGE if you are a woman.  Men can find comfortable shoes no problem and women are generally screwed in this department.  So far I have worn fuzzy duck slippers that quack when you squeeze their beaks and lady bug slippers.  I plan on getting some giant football slippers soon to wear on the weekends.  

One thing that is not cool about where I work is that I am so incredibly nervous.  I was told today that I have a regular voice and a ""customer voice"" which is apparently several octaves above my natural high-pitched cartoonish voice and much louder.  I'm pretty much horrified that anyone has to listen to that.  The sad thing is that I have no idea that it's happening.  I actually try to make an effort to speak comfortably and relaxed to try and ease the customers when they come in.  Apparently, I should give up talking alltogether and perhaps switch to flashcards.  Or maybe I can take up ventriloquism and make it sound like my slippers are the ones talking with the freakish voice. 

So seriously, and my feelings are already hurt so you don't have to worry about that, how obnoxious is my voice and have your ears ever bled while having a conversation with me?"

So when we moved in we realized that it would only be a matter of time before our refridgerator died.  You can tell that it's old because it seems to predate the understanding of ice.  This is what we've figured must be the reason for the freezer never seeming to be able to freeze anything.  We have our refridgerator covered under our home warranty, a lesson learned from Jacob, so when I woke up one morning to a gallon of curdled skim milk I decided to give them a call.  

The phone call and the several phone calls after it were of different stages of annoying and amusing so let me recap the highlights for you.

*they sent us an ""appliance expert"" wearing very tight shorts who upon entering the house promptly belly flopped on the floor and tore the bottom of my refridgerator apart.

*I had to pay said ""appliance expert"" $50 to tell me that the refridgerator was broken

*our home warranty people called me and asked me all kinds of questions I had already answered during our first contact.

*same home warranty person made me measure my refridgerator because I couldn't find the sticker that apparently all refridgerators manufactured AFTER christ was born have.  

*they let me know that they were replacing our fridge and offered me a model number and suggested that Noah and I go find something we like. 

*Noah and I drive to every store we can think of that has appliances and meet George at Home Depot who, even though I explained that we were shopping to let our insurance company know what fridge we wanted, insisted upon giving us a sales pitch and letting us know that we can get a gift card if we get the fridge from Home Depot.

*After much debate, I call the insurance people and tell them what fridge we want only to be told that they can't get us that model and to look at ge.com

*Noah and I pick the closest fridge they had to the model we wanted at ge.com 

*I call back and ask for our second choice only to be told that they can't get us that model but they can get us the original model we asked for which is very close to the second model we asked for

*We order the fridge we want for a minimal cost:)

The one thing that really sucks about our fridge is that we can't seem to agree on where we want to put it because it's too big to put where our current fridge is even if we did rip out the cabinets above it and wherever else we put it we can't hook up the ice/water dispenser. We were considering getting a bottom freezer model for this reason, however, the side by sides have frostguard technology which is something that we really wanted.  The eventual goal, at least in my opinion, is to remodel the kitchen in the next couple years which would include hooking up the water/ice dispenser.  

Overall, I'm happy with the results from our insurance people so far but the fact that answers can change from one minute to the next is a little worrisome.  In the future, I guess if I don't like what I hear I should just hang up and call back?  I'm thinking that I should call them in the next week and ask someone to come out and look at our air conditioner too.  It sort of cools the house now but I'm wondering if that is bunk also.  Anyway, Noah and I are hoping to have a party in September sometime so everyone can see our new shiny child then:)"

"event","So today I was supposed to go fill out my new hire paperwork for Select Comfort at their new location in The Greene.  

Did I mention that today was the grand opening of The Greene?  

Honestly, you would think that everyone forgot that there are TWO other malls within 20 minutes of the The Greene.  

The best part about driving around the new mall is that there is no freaking parking system that makes sense.  The mall is an outside mall and is divided into quadrants(?) with street parking in front of all the stores.  Who thought that making street side parallel parking available in front of Bath and Body Works would end well????   So I spent 30+ minutes getting into the mall area only to drive past Select Comfort and park in a dusty construction area where I had to pay a parking meter.  I live in suburbia so that I don't have to pay parking meters.  So wrong, so so very wrong.  Anyway, I make it into the store to find out that the computers are running on dial-up because they couldn't get the right modem soon enough to have DSL hooked up.  What this means is that they can't download and print all the paperwork I need to fill out so we decided that I'll go to the Dayton Mall store tomorrow to actually do the paperwork.  Then I spent 30+ minutes trying to get out of The Greene.  Honestly, when I think back to the gridlock and bedlam that I was trapped in against my will this afternoon the song Hotel California comes to mind.  

Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm still really happy about the new job with Select Comfort.  As I've mentioned before the posts will be related to the subject line.  So basically, don't go to The Greene for a while if you can avoid it.  It was complete chaos today and made what should have been a pretty painless task a travel nightmare.  Yes, there are a lot of stores and restaurants there that we don't already have in this area but think of it this way.  If you're already an impatient person who can't wait to eat or shop in these places,  you're probably the same impatient person that's going to run over some gawking pedistrian who stops in the middle of the crosswalk to consult their map...."

"event","LA Weight Loss didn't end up working out.  I mean six months into working there I had pretty much figured that out but sometimes  you have to stay somewhere another year to make really sure?  The details of my leaving are upsetting at best.  They tried all sorts of things to get me to quit and then ""we"" agreed that I shouldn't work there anymore.  

The nice thing is that I've had the month of August off.  It's allowed Noah and I to spend more time together and get a few things accomplished like the garage sale that we had. It's also given our animals a lot more stability for a while which hopefully is helping AD to adjust to our new house and stop urinating on everything that smells like Noah (I wish that humans could just go pee on the belongings of everyone we don't like).

The other nice thing about having all sorts of freetime is that it frees you up to apply to all kinds of jobs and gives you a completely open schedule for interviews.  

Yesterday, I got the job offer that I was hoping for from Select Comfort.  I'm going to be working in the Dayton Mall after my dad leaves in September.  Basically, it will suck that I'll be back on a retail schedule, however, the pay is pretty lucrative and everyone that I'll be working with is super nice.  I think it will be good to be back in a positive work environment."

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not posting anywhere so it's not like this journal is getting the shaft or whatever.  Basically, I used to use this journal to vent.  That was when I was updating the most frequently, when everything and everyone seemed to be pissing me off.  Then I used this journal to kind of document(?) Noah's and my dating and when we started living together.  Looking back at the entries that weren't venting, a lot of them had to do with Noah.  Then, LA Weight Loss took over my life.  I was working so much that all of my free time was spent either eating or sleeping which is pretty sad.  I guess that's also when I started to become more private.  Now don't get me wrong, most of the time no one would use the word ""private"" to describe me.  I try to be friendly and open with my friends and most of my acquaintances, I guess I just started following Noah's logic that not everyone needs to know everything.  Plus, who the heck goes on to LJ to read everyone bitching all the time?  I mean I like reading about funny stories that have happened to people or just general updating but I find myself skimming over a lot of long posts on my friends page if the first sentence includes some form of ftw and their last five posts have been about mundane roommate issues or whatever.  Those things are important too but I just don't want to read about them everyday, you know? Ok so skip ahead, I'm going to try and update a little more just because I feel like a mild stalker reading LJ everyday when I haven't been contributing a whole lot to it myself.  I'm also going to try and keep the posts short and properly titled so if y'all aren't interested you can feel free to skip any post you like."

*I'm still at LA Weight Loss but my work there may be changing very soon.  Lots of mixed feelings about this. 
*Noah and I are actually packing like normal people for our move which is a switch from just using garbage bags and laundry baskets to move all of our belongings.
*Although we weren't originally planning on painting the house right away, the more I think about it the more anxious I am to add our own color and decorating to the house.
*Noah and I have been fighting a little bit more than usual due to a lot of stress associated with the new house and moving.  Now that we've actually closed on the house I'm hoping things go back to normal.

8 weird things/habits about me:

1. I'm obsessive about Buffy/Angel/Joss Whedon.  I plan on owning the complete line of Buffy/Angel action 
figures one day.
2. I am extremely superstitious about shower gel.  A lot of my friends already know this, but if I have a bad day or a string of bad days, I will immediately change shower gels and 9 out of 10 times this has worked.
3. I would really like to get my concealed carry license and, honestly, if I didn't have to sit through the classes, I probably would have it already.
4. Taboo is my all-time favorite game and I'm known to go a little crazy if my partner or team isn't keeping up with me.
5. My favorite radio station is 96.5 The Star, more specifically the Ken and Kitty Morning show.  When I was driving to Cincinnati for work everyday that was what I looked forward to in the morning.
6. I haven't really met any celebrities but my dad used to go to a lot of pro-am bowling tournaments when I was younger where anyone could compete with a professional bowler to I got to meet Parker Bohn III who I happened to think was the hottest bowler in existance at the time.
7. One day when Noah and I have money I would LOVE to flip houses.  Since we started the whole house buying process all I want to watch is home improvement shows and there is such a huge profit to be made there.
8. Although I don't really understand video/computer games, I do love to play the Sims.

"event","The last couple of weeks have been a real challenge emotionally.  Going to Youngstown for my grandfather's funeral was even harder than I had imagined.  I had a great visit with my family and was glad that Noah got to meet some more of them but I was just a basketcase most of the time.  Noah was very helpful by being there even if it did seem to confuse everyone who came to the viewing/funeral because no one knew who he was.  

Coming back home to Dayton after that has been trying at times.  I think it was a little easier when my grandmother died because I was still around family all of the time.  Being this far away from my dad is making it really hard.  I find myself thinking more about my grandfather now than I have in years and the memories usually surface when I'm least expecting them to or at inappropriate times for me to break down in tears.  For instance, they played ""I can only imagine"" by Mercy Me so when I hear that song now I'm still pretty broken up, which usually doesn't happen too often because I've been listening to a country station.  Now, however, there's a new song (meaning they are playing it A LOT) ""When I get where I'm going"" by Brad Paisley which is pretty heart wrenching even if both songs are in a good way.  Or I'll be sitting at work with a client and they'll say something that just makes my stomach turn over because it will remind me of something and I'll have to pretend to sneeze or something so that my watery eyes look like an accident...

Most of what bothers me is when I think that my dad, who turns 49 on Saturday, has lost both of his parents.  Thinking of losing my parents is pretty unbearable and my heart just aches for him.  

Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

I'm gonna walk with my grand daddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck"

What hurts the most was that I wasn't very communicative with him in the past year or so...with so much of my time being devoted to work and not having a lot to say to him when we did talk, it wasn't much of a priority for me.  I always figured that we would know that something was going on before he died, but I should have remembered that very seldom does life/fate? give us any indication of it's intentions for us.  Noah and I will be driving to Youngstown on Friday for the funeral.  I have a sinking suspicion that work will give me some sort of problem about this, as they have been fighting me on everything I need lately.  

Rest in peace and love, grandpa.  I've always looked up to you and loved you, even when I couldn't show it very well.  I'm sorry that you didn't get to go on your cruise to Alaska this summer but I imagine you're somewhere a billion times better right now."

Noah and I put up our borrowed Christmas tree tonight (borrowed from his parents until we can get our very own for uber cheap after the holidays) and it is AWESOME.  Of course, with two beagles, one of which is capable of chewing through walls, wires, chairs, and tennis balls, and our two over curious cats this may very well prove to be more of a hassle than a blessing.  I told Noah that we should use fishing line to secure the tree to the ceiling to ensure it stays upright but he insists that it will be fine without the fishing line...only time will tell.

On another note, while Noah was bringing up Christmas decorations from the basement he discovered toilet paper in the basement.  Well how the hell does that happen?  Oh that happens when the sewer line is blocked somehow and our sewage has no where else to go...hmmm.  Our landlord is sending people over to fix it in the morning.  Noah wonders how this keeps happening to us (first the flooding in the old apartment now this). Personally, I don't think anything can compare to the horror that was last Christmas.  At least with this we can just close the basement door..."

After four months of being a counselor in Centerville he said that he has discussed this with Cathy, our regional manager, and they both agreed that I would be a perfect fit for the center.  So as of monday I will have my very own center to develop.  I can't really express how excited, scared, happy, worried, positive, anxious, proud I am about this promotion.  FINALLY I'm working for a company that sees my hard work and wants to reward me accordingly.  IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME:)"

Noah and I have been together over a year now and we love our new house and our new puppy.  Basically everything is better than I could have ever hoped.  

On another note, if certain people don't want other people around, then they probably shouldn't invite them to dinner.  They should also not bother blocking people from im considering those same people they're blocking wouldn't im them anyway.  They might also realize that keeping one significant other as a friend while unfriending the other is pretty fucking pointless when the couple lives together.  Basically, I'm sick of the bullshit.  It's unfortunate that certain people have come into my life and I've allowed them to irritate me so badly, but please be clear, it's only an irritation and a temporary one at that.  

That being said, is there anyone else on my friend's list besides catatonic, Noah, and classic who watches Buffy and/or Angel?  We've run out of episode's and are awaiting Firefly in the mail.  So how are you all getting along without jossness?"

Anyway, so I got to do pretty much what I wanted since my boss was all MIA and whatnot so I decided to reread my entries from the past few years.  One of the best entries that I did was 100 facts about me so I've decided to do that again since there are probably quite a few new people on my friends list who have not bothered to go back and read my entire journal.   And if you have bothered to read my entire journal then you are obviously so starved to find out all about me that you're probably doing a jig right now so it's all good.  

On a completely unrelated note, Noah is currently finishing this LAST UNDERGRADUATE CLASS!!! I am so very very proud of him.  My squishy is a fucking genius:)

100 FACTS ABOUT ME THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CARE LESS ABOUT (PART ONE)

1) My full name is Crystal Dawn Laithwaite

2) I graduated from Wright State University June 2004 with a major in Communications and a minor in Political Science.

3) I refuse to take shit from pretty much anyone.

4) My first job was at a McDonald's in Austintown with a playplace...bad idea, bad, bad, bad

5) I was on the Austintown Fitch High School Speech and Debate Team (Duo Interp) 

6) We (Noah and I) now have TWO cats that are named Anodomony and Cordelia AKA The Cheat

7) I have never watched any of the Star Wars movies

8) I play Neopets more than a 23 year-old college graduate should

9) I got a speeding ticket on 9/11 before/during the planes were actually flying into the buildings

10) I'm really interested in the whole Charles Manson/Helter Skelter story (one of my random projects to learn about)"

When you tell people that you're Republican, they rarely believe you.

That's because you're socially liberal - likely pro-choice and pro-gay rights.

You're also not so afraid of big goverment, as long as it benefits people and not politicians.

You are the most likely of any Republican type to swing over to the Democrat side sometimes.

I wish that Noah would be there when I get back but he has two tests today:(  I hope he's doing OK at school.  I hope that I can actually drive home.

"event","This will be a nice post...because I am a nice person, and sometimes nice people have to bite their tongues.

Since I have joined Primerica, people (different people so no one in particular) have more or less been looking for ""the catch.""  People seem to be used to being beaten down in corporate jobs and never making what they are really worth or maybe they got into some kind of scheme that promised lots of cash and it didn't work out so they think that all opportunities work the same way...whatever the problem is, people don't believe that I can make a multi-million dollar career out of Primerica.  People don't believe that I sit down with families and show them how to save money and pay off all of their debts for free.  People, for whatever reason, may not want to see me succeed where they would possibly fail...and that's OK.  I understand and accept that.  However, I am not going to permit ANYONE to try to bring me down.

Currently, there are TWO people on my friends list that I have offered the Primerica opportunity to.  One person is very interested in working with the company...and the other...well let's just say they're obviously quite ""happy"" where they are at.  

I've also asked a few other people on my friends list for help in trying to get my business started.  Unfortunately, that has been fruitless, which also hurts my feelings because it is hurting my dream directly.  I'm pretty sure that these people don't realize it however, so I'm trying not to let that bother me.  

What does bother me, however, is anyone thinking that me taking a TEMPORARY position at STI until I am established in my business and until Noah finishes his last quarter at WSU and is employed fulltime is a sign of failure.  I like my job at STI but I don't LOVE it because, at the end of the day, I know that I did not go to college for five years to retype documents all day.  I'm not saying that anyone who does that is less than me or that I'm better than anyone else.  I'm just saying that I know that I should be doing something more worthwhile.  I do, however, LOVE my job at Primerica (certain people should probably read that line about a thousand times to get the f*ing point).  

I'm doing what I have to do to get where I want and deserve to be.  People checking up on me to see if I am failing in order to make themselves look and feel better are pretty fucking pathetic in my humble opinion. 

I would also like to point out that there are a whole lot of people in my circle of friends who LOVE their jobs.  They are very talented and educated people whom I admire and I would never post something in MY journal that would imply that my situation is better than any of theirs.  I wouldn't do that because A) it would be factually wrong and B) even if they didn't like their jobs I wouldn't be celebrating the issue.  

On another note, Noah and I have a great relationship.  We love eachother very much and we have a great partnership.  But, I try not to compare our relationship to other people's because I have enough faith in it that I don't need to see if we're keeping up with other people or whatever.  I also don't try and make our relationship out to be something that it's not, for instance, I don't post that he's the best boyfriend because he loves me so much when a few hours before that I was screaming at him that he doesn't love me at all.  THAT would make me a hypocrite....and I despise hypocrites.  

Ok...my tongue is apparently getting a little loose so I'll wrap this up as positively as I possibly can...

Today is a great day because I LOVE MY JOB(s).
My friends are awesome because they don't post stupid journal entries to try and put me down.
My boyfriend is amazing because he loves me with all of his heart and we would do anything for eachother.
Our relationship is awesome because we communicate with eachother.
Today is awesome because hopefully someone will get the hint and stop annoying at least half of our mutual friends...that means you...yes YOU."

"event","Two weeks ago today, Noah and I almost broke up.  I came home from work and he had moved everything out.  His clothes, his computer, his DVDs...he didn't have a whole lot here but it was all gone.  I called him and had to wait for over an hour for him to come over, I sat in his closet and cried for most of it.  I knew that there were reasons he could be leaving me.  We hadn't been happy for a while, we had been fighting a lot, I was feeling smothered, but we had been talking about those things...had been trying to work them out...but he was just gone all of a sudden.  When we finally talked it was bad, most of it out in the parking lot with me standing behind the mustang, arms wrapped around the spoiler, so that he couldn't leave.  It all came out then, everything that had been going on, how I had lied to him, how he found out about it, how sorry I was (and still am).  But the problem was, that even though I had screwed up, we still loved eachother.  Love is stupid like that, it doesn't just go away when you want it to, and standing in the parking lot crying and fighting and feeling like the ultimate in complete white trash as my ghetto neighbors all stared until Noah finally let us go back inside, I would have rather had Noah run me over than let him leave.  

I didn't cheat on Noah.  I did, however, lie to him and for that I am infinitely sorry.  I know that what I did was wrong, I've tried to explain why I did it, and I've tried to explain the situation, but NOTHING is going to make what happened acceptable.  And even though it happened, he's willing to try and work with me to get past it because he loves me.  I might not deserve it be he does it anyway and I love him back more now than I ever could have before because he's the first guy that I've ever cared about that saw something ugly in me and loved me anyway.  He makes me want to be a better person.

The problem is that Noah has friends who are either unwilling or unable to understand the situation.  He has friends that got to hear what happened and came over while I was at work to move him out.  He has friends that have been very vocal in telling him what they think of me.  He has friends that are practically abandoning him because he wants to stay with me.  He has friends that know he can do better, and he has friends that aren't acting like friends at all.  

In fact, I've spent the better half of my online time in the past 12 hours trying to defend myself against some of his ""friends.""  So let me put this out there, if anyone would like to attack me, then they can do it in my own journal.  But first there are some rules:

1) Everyone pick up a rock.
2) If you've ever loved someone enough to give them a second chance then put the rock down and take a step backwards.
3) If you've ever lied to someone because you knew the truth would hurt them then put the rock down and take a step backwards.
4) If you've ever been in a situation where you did something wrong and were thankful that someone you love never found out about it then put the rock down and take a step backwards.
5) If you've ever regretted ending a relationship then put the rock down and take a step backwards.
6) If you're still holding a rock then feel free to throw it.

I know for a fact that most of Noah's friends would be a foot away from their respective rocks right now.  

I love Noah.  I love him every second and I am praying that we get through this together.  ""Maybe I don't deserve another chance, but I need one."" ~Meg Ryan When A Man Loves A Woman."

"event","So it's taken 23 years but I've finally wised up about birthdays.  Since my birthdays are usually ruined by people like my friends and family members, I went ahead and scheduled my birthday party the day BEFORE my birthday.  Tricky, Tricky!  Well, actually, I just started telling people that my party would be on Thursday because I forgot that my birthday was on Friday.  Noah thankfully reminded me, he's the bestest...except for the part where he forgot to buy me a present so he keeps lying and saying it's in his trunk...pbst. yeah. whatever:P  
Anyway, last night was super cool because lots of people came out to celebrate with me!  And my daddy was there for the first time in four years!  And my Noah was there!  And I drank tequila!  And Noah told Jacob he could touch his penis! *shudders*
I got to meet Bianca finally so that was cool.  Hopefully we can play cranium together soon.  I also got a free sundae.  Hmmm, anyway, I have cool friends who got me cool stuff and who took the time out to celebrate with me which usually doens't happen so I'm feeling super blessed.  
Today, Noah, my Daddy, and I are going to Yellow Springs and Youngs for some more birthday fun!  I'm so excited about the goats.  And then tomorrow we are all going to go visit Noah's family!  I am the uber happy.

 PhatSIN8:  good morning

 NoahFN:  awesome
 PhatSIN8:  and now she's eating my pen
 NoahFN:  She takes after me.
 PhatSIN8:  riiiiiight
 NoahFN:  I like to chew on/play with your pens
 PhatSIN8:  uh huh
 NoahFN:  You don't sound convined.
 PhatSIN8:  A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty: 
he said...no. 

She asked him if he would want to be with her 
forever....and he said no. 

She then asked him if she were to leave would he 
cry, and once again he replied with a no. 

She had heard enough. 
 PhatSIN8:  As she walked away, tears streaming down her 
face the boy grabbed her arm and said.... 

You're not pretty you're beautiful. 

I dont want to be with you forever. I NEED to be 
with you forever. 

And I wouldnt cry if you walked away...I'd die... 
 NoahFN:  Thats how I feel.
 NoahFN:  I'm just not good at showing it
 PhatSIN8:  oh blah, whatever
 NoahFN:  heh
 NoahFN:  Why don't you believe me?
 PhatSIN8:  because you're way to sane of a person to die over me
 PhatSIN8:  too*
 NoahFN:  a) since when am I sane
 NoahFN:  b) maybe I wouldn't die for you'd but surely I'd kill for you.

"event","Ok, due to some unfortunate occurences in my life, I've decided to pose this question to everyone who reads my livejournal.  Basically, this is a step by step guide of how to put yourself in my shoes.  Once you complete the excercise please post a comment on how you would feel and/or what you would do in the same situation.  


For this experiment you will need:  an understanding of your own relationships, a significant other (past or current), a ex of the same significant other, and a friend of both your significant other and their ex.  

*note, this is the bare bones of the whole situation.  I'm not including my own stress level or any other information to attempt to sway comments one way or the other.

Consider the following:  YOU are happily dating your SIGNIFICANT OTHER (SO).  However, situations keep arising due to their EX, mainly because their FRIEND keeps inviting the EX to parties that YOU and your SO also attend.  Your SO is still uncomfortable around their EX because their EX did not treat them very well.  YOU are uncomfortable around their EX because their EX has been rude to you and insists upon IMing YOU and continuing to text message and IM your SO (this behavior also increases after seeing the EX).  Recently, the FRIEND invited the EX to a party where the only people the EX knew were the FRIEND, the friend's SO, your SO, and another guest.  The FRIEND has reacted badly when YOU have tried to explain your feelings about the situation and there is now a conflict concerning YOU, your SO, and the FRIEND.  

So there you go, please comment, maybe I'll explain the whole situation later."

"event","<lj-cut text = &quot;This is sad and if you don't want to read it then don't.&quot;>
I'm sick today.  My stomach hurts a whole lot and I have a headache.  I'm updating my livejournal because Noah asked me to.  There is so much going on in my life right now and I feel like I don't really have control over any of it.  I feel like I'm crashing.  

Tyra is dating Cory.  They've been together for a few weeks now, I've been trying to figure out how I feel about this.  At first I was really hurt and sad that Tyra would do this to me, but now I'm just really hurt and sad that they don't want me in their lives.  I love them both, they've been such a large part of my happiness in the past few years, and I miss them more than I can bear sometimes.  I want to be happy for them, I am happy for them. But I can't help feeling like a burden or feeling that I'm bringing them down.  I wish I knew how to make it better but I don't, They're the ones in control of the situation.  All I have the option to do is walk away, and I have never been very good at that.  

Yesterday, Noah and I had a long talk that was basically about the same kind of stuff.  I worry so much that I'm not making him happy.  That I'm going to hurt him.  I know that I don't deserve him, that he shouldn't have to deal with me as sad as I am sometimes, but I can't seem to explain that either.  He thinks that I don't want to be with him, but that's not it at all.  Sometimes it hurts because I want to be with him so much.  He's so happy all the time and I feel like I have nothing to offer him.  It scares me that he cares so much about me because he can do so much better.  Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm starting to rely on him too much or that things are getting too serious and I don't know what to do.  It feels like i'm ripping open old wounds when we're together sometimes.  I think back to other guys and realize i wasn't really happy and then the same stuff happens with Noah and I am happy.  I can't really explain it.  And at the same time it's like Cory is doing the same thing with Tyra.  He's doing everything with her that he did with me only now he's happy and that hurts too.  It's like finding out that you're not good enough and good enough at the same time and the only person I have to talk to about this stuff is myself because no one else understands but I don't understand it either.  And I'm on this new medication and I don't understand how it works.  All I know is that it's taking away how I feel so that I'm more on an even basis but it's hurting everything too.  It makes me so tired and I have no sex drive and it's like i'm living in this fog.  And more and more I'm just having this overwhelming feeling of guilt that somehow I didn't turn out the way I was supposed to.  That I'm doing everything really wrong and I wonder if maybe it's because I just don't love myself, but I think I do.  Because I'm honest with myself and I worry about myself and I try to do good things for myself, and then I think that maybe that's why things seem so wrong, because everyother time I've been in a relationship I was looking out for the other person and not caring about me, and now I'm looking out for myself first but that just hurts too.  

All I want is to feel better, but I don't see how that's really possible right now.  I mean it's not something I can just do or be.  So I'm left with guilt.  Is it right to be with Noah because that's what I want to do if I think that it's not the best thing for him to be with me? Is it right for me to keep talking to Cory and Tyra if they don't want to talk to me just because it will make me feel better?  Is it ok to rely so heavily on my dad to help me pay for stuff every month because I am unable to make my own ends meet without hurting myself?  Is it ok to think about my best interests first when situations involve other people?  These are thoughts I have everyday.  Noah, I wonder if that's what I should have said to explain it to you yesterday.  That I needed to hear that you wanted to be with me so that I could stop feeling guilty that I wanted you to be with me.  Or why I felt so bad this morning when you said what you said.  I know that I'm hard to love.  I know that because I'm so inconstant and needy.  It almost doesn't seem fair that I should be able to love everyone else so easily, to forgive so much, to give so much to other people, but maybe that's the balance that God intended me to have.  I have faith that things will work out someday, I just wish that it was now.</lj-cut>"

I bet people are getting sick of reading our conversations but we're just so damn funny we want to share it with everyone, heh.  Anyway, last night was interesting.  Noah and I promptly ran out of ideas on what to do around 7pm.  When we finally decided on a game plan that changed also due to Craig having a family emergency.  We did however get to show Numfar to Adam which was a good thing, and Noah finally saw most of Donnie Darko.  

After returning home, I showed Noah how to make a green alcoholic milkshake and we promptly fell asleep.  I'm pretty sure that we slept but I kept waking up.  My bed apparently hates Noah.  My cat, however, made nice with Noah during the night and now they are bestest friends.

The guy that hit them let his car and went running through a field after the accident.  All of this week Sharon has been in a lot of pain but apparently her sister suffered the worst from the accident.  She wasn't wearing her seatbelt and during the crash she split her kneecap open.  She had to have surgery on her knee this week and last night she passed away.  Apparently a blood clot had resulted from the surgery, moved to her heart, and killed her.  Sharon's sister was relatively young and she is leaving behind two girls, one very little and one graduating highschool this year.  This makes me so sick and so sad because Sharon is one of the nicest people that I have ever met and her and her sister shared a very special relationship.

"event","yeah so today was a horrible day to begin with. I woke up and had to do yard work from 11;45 to like-4;00! it sucked so bad. i was at my dads so i really had no friends to hang out with-so i went to the mall with my 2 sisters and my older sisters boyfriend Danny(tons of laughs!!). Nothing looked good at the mall and the fair was across the street, so we went there and angela and Danny (boyfriend-n-girlfriend) went on the faresswheel, and me and my step-sister christina went on the Alpine Bobs(also known as the lightning bolt, or the musical..something. It was so much fun- i'm addicted! well so john and jessica got back together which is cool- there such a sweet couple( though they fight alot)- so i'm happy about that all! well i'm not in the mood to write right now because i'm so fucking bored!

"event","Hey, so today i woke up about... most likely 11/12 something, feeling actually awake and fresh. My sister was on the floor next to me and she was practically up so we talked for a little while. Well when i got up i went straight to the computer-lol- and signed on to talk to soe people. Me, and my two sisters watched Sharktale- until me and my sister angela came on the computer to listen to music and talk to people. My dad then told my sister to go to sams club with him and she didnt wanna go alone so she told my dad to tell me i had to go to which got me mad at her because i wasnt dressed and i wasnt wearing any make-up, not to mention my hair wasnt even straightend! Well we went and i felt like we were there for hours! it was so boring. Well we got back and nothing really happened until me and my sis went up to her boyfriends work with her friend Linsday- we were there for about a half hour. We then came back where i went online and the rest of the family ate and we all then watched sharktale (again). I got to try out this really nice expensive hair straitner which worked pretty good, but i was really bored so i just sat and watched the movie. So my sisters friend went home and i went into my pajamas and came online which leads me to now- my sister is coming on to so were ganna surf the web for a bit- and my other sister is at work- pizza pizza-lol..."

"event","Hey, well i really havent written in in a while so i'll just tell you whats been going on lately. Okay so nothing. Well i'm at my dads for the weekend which is sweet but i'm really sick. It totally sucks, but i have a really bad cough and a cold, not to mention i've been feeling faint- i almost passed out a few times. I missed school on thursday and friday, and i might monday- but its really bad i'm missing becasue were taking the MEAP! Well on monday i'm ganna have to make it up- so hard. Well i just met my uncle Patrick yesterday and my soon to be aunt Jamie-(there getting married soon). They spent the night last night and they are again tonight, but there leaving tomorrow. Well there both super nice and were getting along great. oh yeah- back to today... I woke up at like- 1:00 about, but it was making me so mad because everyone kept coming downstairs( i slept on the basement couch) and waking me up. Well when i finally got up i felt like crap- my teeth were nasty, i couldnt breath out of my nose, and i was really hot. My sister said that me,her,my step-sister-her boyfriend, my sisters boyfriend,lindsay,and my sisters boyfriends friend were going to a movie then bowling. Well i came upstairs and just layed in her bed for a while because i was really pale and wanted to faint (literally). Well about an hour or two later i took a shower, and got ready when i got out- which i didnt feel like doing. Well a while later we all left to bowl, but i didnt actually bowl- waaay to ill. That lasted forever it seemed. After that, we all went to linsdays and played Mario Party 6, but after a while everyone started getting tired- especially me, so we watched a movie called Billy.. something- cant remember. Well i didnt really want to watch it so i fell asleep on the couch. I got woken up by my sister and we came home- HAPPILY! it was about 8 by then, and we left at like- 1:30. I went to my bro's room where i was honestly shaking forever, it was freaking cold. My cousin Nick was in there- he's 13, playing some game, i think it was Halo, but he turned it off so we could talk- (we talk alot- he's pretty cool with it) Well we got bored after a while, but he left w/my sister to 7/11 so my sis could get coke, and he got a slush. (blah blah blah) well when they got back me and him watched 8 Mile, which got boring after a while, so we came downstairs where all my dads friends were playing pool, and i played Dance Dance Revolution- well that lasted about a minute- my body couldnt take it, i'm coughing a storm, i cant breath out of my nose, and my head it pounding really hard and i need to take it easy for a while. Well i guess all that leads to this, so i'll write in tomorrow or in 2 weeks or so..."

"event","Hey,I havn't written in in about 2 days or so, but nothing has really happened... So today i woke up at about 11:00 and my dad was talking to my sister about silverware!-omg, he talks loud (normally) and it woke me up, i was so mad. Well i went out of my room and my sister was sitting down and he was like- ""dont use the hard side of the sponge to clean dishes with because there gold and if you use the scrapper side you will ruin my dishes. Well then he started talking to BOTH of us about it for about a half hour, but my step-sister was still sleeping and I had to wake her up to tell her dad wanted to talk to her, well he was lecturing us about dishes which was lame yet hillarious becasue he just kept going on and on about it, well if your wondering about how sick i've been i'd say today was one of the worst becasue i could barely walk, i had to lean over and i felt horrible.Well because i'm so lazy i stayed in my pajamas for a while and got some cereal-oh yeah!- last night my tooth was hurting like he11 and i couldnt take it anymore so i went ito the bathroom and pulled it with toilet paper, but it hurt badely and i was like- ""great this will take forever because i pulled it hard and it hurt but it didn't come out, but then i looked at the toilet paper and it was there, but the tooth was a mooler so it bled pretty hard. Well i no it sounds weird that i'm still losing baby teeth at my age but i've only lost i think 4 teeth (this one being my 5th) so i still have most baby teeth.but yeah, i showed my dad and he said put it under my pillow(HA-HA!)- that is so funny!-yeah no... well i'm just happy its out because i am (was) on medicine for the pain but gladely the pain is gone. So anyways, and ate breakfast and went into my brothers room to watch a movie. Well i started Legally blonde and watched about 4 minutes of it when my brother Jason came in and said to go downstairs and watched it...So i did and it was enjoyable. Well my sister angela came down to tell me she's going to work in a minute so she left a little while later  and my dad,brother,sister,and step-mom all left somewhere- PARTYYY! o actually i just sat there bored as he11. I wanted to watch t.v but my dad was recording a show so i had to sit there and watch JUDGE TRUDY for and hour! I was so bored yet hungry because it was about 6:00 at that time and I ate about 11:15 this morning. Well my dad and step-mother came back around 6:45 with food which was good because i was still hungry because i hadn't eaten (food is my friend). Well afterwards i went online and talked to my friend Christina who got the top of her ear pierced which was unfair because i want mine so bad its unreal. Well i played DDR after that and my step-sister Christina came home from a friends house and at that time for some reason i was completely hyper which is weird because i'm usually calm and never hyper. Well we each played DDR but it got boring after a few songs so she played the Sims and i went online. If your wondering what i did online its what i'm doing (WRITE) now...

"event","Today i all i have to say is i'm feeling sick. I woke up around 1:45 (in my book thats early)but i was so uncomfortable becaue i slept on the floor of my brothers room. Well when i woke up he wasnt in the room so i instantly put on Family Guy- the best show ever! well i watched about 6 episodes, but i got pretty bored, not to mention i felt like i was about to throw up that second. Well i went into the bathroom and leaned over the toilet...(well you know where this is going) i dont think medicine will help me though because i've been sick for a few weeks straight, i almost had to go the hospital once. My family says i'm not eating anything barely anymore... Its really weird though, i can go a day withought eating barely anything, but its like i'm a little hungry, yet i feel full, so i can go even longer (but i'm honestly not like- starving my self)---(And i'm not belemic**!)well i was fine afterwards and..just kept watching episodes of Family Guy.Huu..it was so boring though- my sister and brother went to work, and my step-sister went to a friends house-AND!- my dad was sleeping, so i just stayed in my brothers room, watching So I Married An Axe Murdurer(you probaly never heard of it). Well thats honestly all i have done today- sorry my life's so boring, not feeling to well to come back on later... 

    (p.s)- lately i've been really moody so you'll have to excuse me for that..."

"event","Hey, well today is christmas Eav and its pretty busy. The day started with waking up about 1:30 or so, but i thought it was christmas morning so i was all excited. Well on Wed. i spent the night at my friends shelby's house and we were so hyper. It was so fun though, lets just say we had alot to talk about... Well all day i'v been in the house doing christmas cooking and wrapping presents so i'm worn out. I was waiting for about 5:00 because i knew my dad would call soon so i waiting. He called about that time but i actually told him to come pick me up in about 2 hours.( Its his Christmas this year) Well time went by slow/yet fast. I was so hungry i hadent eaten anything that day, but my mom got pizza and i took one bite and my dad and couzin Nick pulled up in the driveway- oh well. Well driving to my dads took a long time it seemed but my dad had to go to the store and i hate going with him,  so he was going to drop off my couzing at his house anyways so he just dropped me off with him. My couzing was so hyper and loud the neibors probaly heard him. Well my dad came back sooner than expected so me and him left. We drove around for abut five minutes, we (my dad actually) was looking to see what would be open on christmas so he could get a few things, i was like,dad- no-body wants to work on christmas, most people have lives of there own (but in a funny way). So we finally came back to the house where i looked at all the christmas presents. I found that my dad actually put (for instance) To:Marie/ From: Santa! okay, i'm sure he came already, its so lame. Do you beleive in Santa? in Not- congradulations, you diserve a sticker. Well i got to go, more christmas crap-lol-j/k

"event","Hey, so today i woke about 12:15 and felt horrible, my mouth was dried out and just felt..lazy. Well i laid in bed (couch) for about 45 min. but then i got up and only my brother and dad were awake. Well i watched tv for a while when my cousin woke up and we watched tv for a few min. but it was so boring so we decided to play game cube for a while. We messed around so much and it was fun- my sister got so mad because we were loud. Well we were in there for a while.My cousin had to leave a while later so i took a shower while my sister went somewhere and my dad was still here. I looked like crap and my hair was a mess, until some-one walked in the door, lets just say a surprise person walked in the door whom i will keep to be confidentional. I was so shocked, i was shaking and wanted to cry. Well i was so happy to see him such a long time! Well, i was speechless i have to say, but me, (the person) his g/f, and my sister all went out to eat, but when we came back, everyone left but me, my dad was going X-mas shopping and obviuosly didnt want me to go. Well i stayed home when my step-sister came home. It was so boring waiting for my family to come home, they were gone for hours! Well when they FINALLY came home, me, (the person) my sister, and step-sister all played ddr, which they are doing now, well not to much is happening later but us all watching a movie. Well i'll make sure to write in tomorrow

"event","Hey, I havent written in in a little while so i'll tell you the 411... The week went by so slow, i didnt think it would ever end, but today is friday so the day was a bit more up-to speed. But ofcourse, everthing was boring! Tyler Celser asked me out, but i said no, i'm so p.o @ him its unreal!I'm wondering if Kenny Solden likes me or not, not to  sure about that,but-we'll just have to see. Everyone thinks i like him but i'm not sure i do,well...no- i dont really like him. I have sorta asked out conner Krause but not exactly, so i dont really have an answer, i'm just so nervouse to ask... Well i got home and i did really-nothing. I got picked up from my bus stop and i was a bit sick. I really think out schools food is contaminated or sumthing because i rarely buy from thiem, but when i do i feel horrid afterwards. Well i got home and Christina called me,but i was on the phone and told her i'd call her back which i didnt, i just wanted to lye down and vomit!  well sadely i had to go to a few places with my mom which didnt help my stomach at all, but when we got home, my dad was there already. I was so frikken happy to see him, but i was so sick he praboly thought i didnt want to see him. Well we drove back and picked up my couzin Nick to spend the night, he's 13 so he's cool-we have our moments but most of all he's awsome. Well so far i havent done much of anything here but check mail and stuff, i'm so happy to finally go online, but now i think i'm going to play some Dance Dance Revolution with the cousin,so i'll write in tomorrow

"event","Holy crap i am so happy its friday, even though i didnt have school on Monday, the week went by so slowly, it dragged on forever... School today was so boring, it started off with waking up and hour late, then the bus was 10 minutes late and it took a hole 45 minutes to get to school because of the traffic. I miss most of first period but it didnt really matter, the gay teacher actually waited the whole 45 minutes for the late bus kids to get there which sucked because then it means that all the work was pushed to the last 15 minutes of class, but no homework so who can argue?... All through the rest of the day went pretty bad because my friend Ashley wasnt there so it wasnt as good. Wed. was so awsome because i went to the 89X stole christmas concert which was sweet because Taking back Sunday, Good Charolette, and The Used were there, along with Jimmy-Eat-World and Frank Furdinad** or something, i dont know-he was bad i think. Anyway, i got back pretty late, then showered and went to bed, i was so tired the next day. Back to today- i went through the day but today was ""Food day"" in world language wich was ok but i think the food was poisened (just kidding) but i got really sick from it and now i feel like crap. I rode the bus home and when straight to Christina S's house and and just started updating, so i'll write in later,

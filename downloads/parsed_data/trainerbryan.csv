This is not including of course the bruising of my bum and my ego as my sulky became a Herby and split in two.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Once again I fail to see the humour in my personal traumatic brush with death at the hooves of the two magnificent pony&rsquo;s whose brute strength alone wrent my sulky asunder. Anybody who tells you it was down to my welding is entirely misguided.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">As for all the usual requirements that go to making up these events. We had the M25 closed north of the river. We had the threat of rain. Yet despite this two of my good friends and travellers made it from oop north across the Woolwich ferry to join us for a few hours of hot dry play. By the mid afternoon I had 5 texts to say people could not make it for one reason or another.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Given that most of these where cpls. I will leave you to do the maths. What we did end up with was by far the most fun event I think I can personally recall in the history of the club.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Billed as THICKSTEAD by one of our regular pony&rsquo;s (yes a pony with whit) it lived up to its name to the tee. We had a jump off as the first event with real proper grown up jumps.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>One particular stallion will be hobbled or shot if he drags me round the course like a butcher&rsquo;s dog stealing sausages again.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>A job for Sir Ian and his gun I feel?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>The jousting went off as usual with great hilarity and minimal cheating.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>This could not be said however for trainer and pony that chose to cut a swathe through the tea party under a shady tree thus adding a good few seconds ONTO there time. Yet still coming in first on the second run. Practice huh?</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">It is my duty to impart details of yet another mechanical breakdown of epic proportions. This time not in the paddock where assistance and repair could be made available post haste.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>No this misshape occurred on the dense woodland path. Making helicopter access impossible. We are to far from any navigable river to make a nautical rescue viable. So the only alternative short of bringing in the marines. Was to carry SIR IAN&rsquo;s broken sulky out by hand.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>God it was hell. I would have helped but my bum hurt.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">All in all as far as I could see and tell. The 18 revellers that survived the Motorway system had a fantastic time. Old faces welcomed new and made firm friends on a whinny and a handshake.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I know the NDPC will go from strength to strength if we keep up this level of enthusiasm and pride in what we offer.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">Oh yes and there was a useless muddy flee ridden poodle there as well. It&rsquo;s fair to say she is very very beautiful but couldn&rsquo;t catch a rabbit if she had a walk on part in watership down.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;"">So once again.

Official grounds NDPC. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>We where blessed with a more than average turnout for the time of year. Once again we decided on a relaxed format for the day. Given the mixture of attendees, for the first time ever and with some pride I can say we had exactly the right amount of beautiful DOM ladies to attend to the very happy and grateful pony boys.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>With all the ponies (both male and female) taken care of, I found myself at something of a loss. This sense of being unloved was quickly replaced with a sore ear hole. I had decided to tack up my adorable little Farabela pony Carousel. In her shiny new red and white livery she quite literally stole the show. She has always been a very norty pony. And has recently become a bloody noisy one too.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>At barely 15 hands she can whinny and snort like a </span><st1:place><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Wigan</span></st1:place><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""> cotton mill claxon. Having run me ragged round the paddock and woods and destroyed 50% of my hearing I took her to her stall, watered her, fed her and rubbed her down for the day. Once again I found myself ambling around with a sense of awe at how well it was all going. So I made use of a very amenable subs bum.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I found the aforementioned sub dangling between a cpl of trees in the woods.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Its amazing what you find in them there woods. Suffice it to say that said subby went home with a very sore bum and legs.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>All in all a wonderful day was had by all. And as one we all agreed that the spring could not come soon enough.

"event","On a lighter note . My little Terry the Tumor has taken to keeping me awake at nights lately with odd and rather annoying headaches.
What the silly little thing doesn't seem to realize is that i have been doing this for nearly 40 years with the assistance of good English Bitter and even better Irish Whisky. 
So fuck ya Terry . your not so clever after all are ya?"

"event","There are things in a life that make ya sit up and take a look around for the shrouded figure that is fate. A cpl of years ago i bout my vintage Suzuki off a dear old friend of mine . He loved that bike and didn't want to part with it . But it needed a lot of TLC&nbsp; I had the time and the passion, he didn't&nbsp; So coinage of&nbsp; the realm changed hands and the deed was done. 
On Friday i decided to take the old girl off the road for a while for much needed work . So the SORN was applied for.&nbsp; ""The Tank"" as a girly friend of mine rather ungraciously but aptly named it , is now off the road.
On Sunday i receive call from another friend to say that My old Biking mate had committed suicide on Friday. The tank sits in my garden, it is one of the saddest things i think i have seen in a very long time.&nbsp; Ironicly its Black . and when the pitiful English sun catches its paintwork., it conveys the pointlessness of the deed and the passing of a beautiful and waisted life. You will be missed by all that knew you mate . 
I doubt i will ever ride the tank again?"

"event","Well absolutely no bloody news so far on the lump in my gray matter . Other than that it is a Glioma ?
yeah . thats what i thought. Now having said that . I have not slept for three days on the trot . It may well be phsyco sematic (and i guess thats not how you spell it but sod it) Anyway . w all get headaches and do''nt realy think much about it . 
So why am i getting these low dull achy head aches deep down right where Da lump is innit ? So much so that i just cant nod off cos i am scared i wont wake up ?&nbsp; and that is odd cos i had a guest with me&nbsp; the other night and she&nbsp; thought i was dead bless her ROFLMAO. Not that any body gives a toss . But i will add to this little journo as the tale of Da lump init ,&nbsp; unfolds

"event","I have a Tumor . I am going to call him Terry. You have to laugh realy . Aparently his second name is Glioma?&nbsp; The ministry of they,&nbsp; have decided that Terry might or might not have been around for some time. He may be binign . he may not . Given the inconclusive nature of this diagnosis they have decided to run a test. In 6 months. Not tomorrow . Not next week . But 6 months. Reason? Well its obvious really isn't it? To see if Terry is&nbsp; growing.&nbsp; Now forgive me . But are we not being told continuosly that cancers and so on can be treated far easier and with greater success if they are caught in the early stages? I have this mental image of all the chaps at the ministry&nbsp; of they running a sweep stake to see who can grow the biggest Terry or equivelent in a given amount of time. The winner recieves the coveted platinum Petri dish.&nbsp; Well whist the chaps at the ministry of They wait patiently for the myriad Terries and there cousins to propagate in bits of anatomies all over the country, I hope they don't mind If i ponder on the reasoning behind there delaying tactics . I dare say Terry will grow . And i dare say it's vital that they find out how much by in the ensuing months. But none of this takes away the gut churning fear every time i get a twinge of a headache like the one i have now.&nbsp; Still , Terry is nice and snug and warm up there in my head. Shame my bloody feet are freezing . Must put some sox on.

"event","Subject:&nbsp;The Night of the Senses
Well once again the North Downs Pony Club went forth into the seemingly unknown. By kind invite to the Night of the senses, myself and two beautiful ponies. My own Ardis and a new girl i am training Varmi and her groom arrived in Brixton just outside the venue itself . The well known Mass. For those that don't now it. Its a huge church in the middle of a huger island surrounded by Huger amounts of traffic. Oh joy. Chaos ensued as soon as we entered the place . Stewards everywhere clearly drafted in for the night as none of them had a clue where we where supposed to be lol.&nbsp; So in true pioneering spirit. I let my Ardis deal with it while i went perving. (hey its my job) We watched some of the earlier breathtaking stage shows and began to realise we had a lot to live up to at this point. After locating the backstage dressing rooms i did my best to get the two girls changed. I am beginning to realise that Ardis is not an ordinary Pony. No . she is a Barbi Pony. As i am un packing her harness and tac . she is revealing pots of Vaseline and lots of little tubes of glitter. Varmi is befouling the air with nervous dyspepsia (clearly not used to the roar of the grease paint and the smell of the crowd yet lol) The girls are now ready . I am covered in bloody glitter ""thanks Ardis grrrrrrrr"" We climb three flights of stairs to the rear of the stage to find it completely submerged in soapy water? The show is clearly not going to happen due to us not being able to stand up. Apparently the previouse act was ummmm shall we say , based on a young ladies hydraulics ? 
The front row where soaked as well hmmmmmm?
A brief Pony Trainer type conference and we decided to simply stampede the club, and so we did. The pony's and I toured all three floors , up and down lifts (yes ponies in lifts lol)In and out of rooms drawing gasps of awe and amazement , ""dam the girls looked beautiful"". It was decided to simply let them loose and enjoy themselves , and this they did with aplomb.&nbsp; Ever seen two ponies fighting over a love heart sweety ? too funny. Varmi thought it amusing to wait till i got in the lift then charge me into a crumpled heap in the corner, Pony head space? 
It is always satisfying to watch the credits of an epic movie and read the part where it says "" no animals where injured during the making of this movie ""
Sadly this was not the case. We did not make a movie for a start. No, poor Varmi. On her first ever trip out in her new boots Took a tumble. Steel shoes on stone floors . Bad combo. Sadly she has sprained a fetlock quite badly and will be out of the paddock for a few weeks. In true Pony spirit though she has asked me to make her some new Boots with suckers on lol. 
All in all a great night. 
Tears , laughter, drama, pathos. it had it all. 
Huge thanx to Tuppy Owens for the chance to let the NDPC&nbsp; strut its stuff. And of course to all the crew there that made us so welcome. We will be back if we are invited

I know i am not wearing a tie. I didnt wear one for either of my weddings. I don't wear one in court . So i fail to see why I should wear one as a Trainer.&nbsp; However, i feel safe in the knowledge that one of you will have a pop about it anyway.&nbsp; Told you all I was bloody gorgious though did'nt I?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you like the hat, rather me is'nt it ?
Take care you guys. And for gods sake lighten up.

"event","Some of you may have noticed the occasional reference to the commings and goings of the roadworks at the end of my road. Lets not go there huh ? suffice it to say that they have rendered our little village almost entirely cut of from the civilised world.&nbsp; 

Imagine then if you will the sight that met me when i managed to actualy get out onto the main road this morning with no hastle (no bloody lights . no roadworks !!!!!!!!!) 
WRONGGGGGGGGGGGG.&nbsp; I had traved no more that 200 yards when the trafic in front of me had come to a total standstill for as far as the eye could see . (more roadworks.lights thinks I) 
Now as i happened to be on my motorbike at the time i did the thing that pisses the four wheeled motorist off more than anything lol . Yep . I zipped down the outside, tee hee . After about half a mile of nipping in and out of the traffic i was in a fairly chirpy mood . When there it was. Surealism incarnate. 
Now i need you to understand that despite this being a major arterial road , at this point it is very narrow . (about 8 or 9 miles of one lane traffic each way.&nbsp; Sat stood still in the road ahead . was THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE.&nbsp; no i am not on drugs . and yes i am of sound mind and body.&nbsp; 70 tons of shunter sitting on a bloody great low loader in the road. the low loader had died and the driver was sitting there reading his paper waiting for the little man to pull him away , DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.&nbsp; About 20 miles or so from here is a wonderfull piece of local history . Its the bluebelle railway . they have lots of beutifuly restored steam loco's and so on . and are constantly opening new stretches of dissused railway (thanx for that Mr beaching) . Naturaly amongst their prize excibits is good ole THOMAS . Every now and then he goes on a little outing to another railway and puffs up and down with hoards of happy smiling Marmite flavoured children on board his creaky old carriages . But not today . today he was stuck half a mile from my house looking very silly indeed.&nbsp; So I want to take my hat off&nbsp; (yes i am a little&nbsp; overwieght . and I like to be in control ok grrrrrrrr) to the reverand W V Audry for his inspred creation. To see it leap from the pages of his wonderful books in such grand style was truly up lifting roflmao."

"event","Well summer in england wrought its usual havock a the length and breath of the country . I wonder at the tenacity and fortitude of the massive army of little parish councilors . church do gooders and school teacheres that tirelesly devote there time and effort every year to bring a ray of sunshine to there local comunity , and possibly raise a few quid for a local charity of some sort .&nbsp; And with out fail . It pisses down ever bloody year . <br /><br />My story ?&nbsp; Well myself and a few stalwart comunity minded souls have been organising a fayre within a local comunity. (<a href=""http://www.dv8.uk.com""> www.dv8.uk.com</a> ) How public spirited i hear you think.&nbsp; Well its fair to say that the comunity in question is actualky the local fetish scene , but hey . its a fayre right ?<br /><br />My part in all this ? Well i run a Human pony play group . so the ail was to have a few pony boys and girls there . Well as per the usual things never actualy pan out as one expects . But we are Brittish so we gird our loins and carry on regardless. Having spent weeks making a shiney new cart for my beautifu lPony  Ardis to pull me along in&nbsp; it turns out on the day that we are waterlogged . so that stayed at home . A week befor the event my #1 Pony girl and admin officer ceases to exsist ( no i didnt shoot her although the thought did cross my mind lol) and so it goes on . <br /><br />The event itself went swimmingly despite the attempts of mother nature . The car park burst to overflowing . The main arena was a murmuring burbling riot of activity with lots of loverly demos and superb stalls to buy thing or just ohh and ahhhhhhhh over.&nbsp;&nbsp; As for our contribution? Well Ardis My beloved and beautiful Pony girl ( pis to follow) Rapidly became the centre of attention , with awe struck gazes following her in her wake where ever she gracefully wandered.&nbsp; Granted not many ponies on full dressage /show rig are seen sipping vodka and coke elegantly for a bloody straw.&nbsp; But hey . it was humid&nbsp; and one cannot live on chopped bananas alone right ?<br /><br />So there you have it . A great day was had buy all those you braved the surrounding motorways and the ensuing summer madness.therein. We had a little natter at one point and decided that this was definately to be the first of many events along the same lines . <br />So who knows . Maybe you will share a day with us in the near future . <br /><br />In the mean time . take care and play safe all of you <br />Trainer Bryan &amp; Pony Ardis"

From simply misplacing an item to being robbed. <br /><br />Like most of us i have been robbed burgled or whatever at some point or another. However i have just experienced a new and interesting form of theft.&nbsp; Ive had a dream stolen&nbsp; right from under my nose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now with a car . a stereo , a wallet or&nbsp; indeed most material items, They are replacable in one form or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Answere me this . You ever tried to replace a dream?&nbsp; A tangible touchable, warm, living dream.&nbsp; Hell i have ideas aplenty. and a cpl of very cosy little thoughts about me. (one stayed over this weekend ""thanx Ardis"") But my <i><u>dream</u></i> has been cruely and cold heartedly snatched away from me. Oh well , shit happens i guess.&nbsp; Time to rebuild. AGAIN."

"event","Isnt it funny how one day can be completely different from another?&nbsp; Just as well realy i guess, life would be awfully dull otherwise.&nbsp; Yesterday i was all ready to blather on about a theory i have been stewing on for weeks now , and today my hearts just not in it for one reason or another.&nbsp; Interestingly enough i am consumed with another emotion. The complete negative of love in fact.&nbsp; Yep , HATE. I know what your gonna say . "" the&nbsp; emotion and the energy it involves are a total waist of time""&nbsp; Anoyingly i totaly agree. However it transpires that somebody has gone out of there way to ruin my otherwise fairly mundane life with there pettyness and self centred theological bullshit.&nbsp; The theologicly challenged tend to have a particularly narrow outlook on life and none more so than in the case of this individual. 
So back to the Love issue. (not that i can be assed now but here goes anyway) I find i am surrounded by poeple that i can genuinly say i love. There are many others that i care for,&nbsp; In general i am a decent guy that will help where ever i can and be there for those that matter to me.&nbsp; The idea of loving someone sends waves of confusion though some people and often trepidation and fear.&nbsp; Its as if by saying "" i love you"" that you are commiting them to a lifetimes contractual agreement to be bound to reciprocate. Nothing could be further from the truth in most cases.&nbsp; I adore and love most of my friends (given that the word freind is a very missused word indeed)&nbsp; My true freinds know who they are and know i love them.&nbsp; Funny what ya come out with after 8 pints and a curry lol?&nbsp; I know one or two of them feel a reciprocal love or emotion very similar. We have cried together at funerals, weddings, rugby matches and so on.&nbsp; Regards family . well yes i guess its fair to say that most of us love our kith and kin to a cirtain degree wether we like to admit it or not .&nbsp; Personaly i cant stand to be in the same room as my father . But i love him because he is my father.&nbsp; In his own way he made me what i am today . Every thing he's not ""thank god lol""&nbsp; I have recently taken on the temporary care of a big hairy dog.&nbsp; Once again i can genuinly say that i am growing to love her despite the drawbacks of actualy owning a dog and the affect it is having on my everyday life. But she has brought something into our home (apart from hair and duck shit) and that is unconditional love, centred mostly round her belly its true . but its there.&nbsp; Now . heres the bit that sends the ripples of confusion through the masses.&nbsp; Being IN LOVE !!!.&nbsp; I am not in love with my freinds, my children my family, or the dog (mind you she has killer eyes XXX) After a great deal of consideration i have realised that i have only been in love three times in my life.&nbsp; All of witch have been&nbsp; unrequited to all intents and purposes.&nbsp; Its fair to say they they&nbsp; had a profound affect on me in seperate ways and changed me as a person imesurably.&nbsp; One was quite simply a juvenile infatuation. Yet over the years i have looked back on it and realised that it was indeed my first and probably only genuine love. Ironicly it was rekindled somewhat disasterously several years later.&nbsp; (we met at a rugby match after many&nbsp; years). The second was my first wife.&nbsp; No analysis neccesary . I was completely infatuated and head over heels in love . That episode took me&nbsp; 15 years to get over. The third ?&nbsp; My beautiful and long time submissive, soul mate, and best friend. She is always in my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly enough , i have always been polygamouse and never gave a thought to a multy partner relationship being an issue untill recently.&nbsp; During all of my relationship i have always been open about my feelings and so on. As i say . up untill recently its never been an issue.&nbsp; Maybe there are poeple out there who are more afraid of being offered someones love on an unconditional basis than i ever imagined. Its a gift . Its not shrouded in self doubt,&nbsp; needyness,&nbsp; or any other underlying emotional adhesive.&nbsp; If its offered . accept it, embrace it,&nbsp; take it for what it is.&nbsp; Just please avoid the duck shit  . 
Well that wasnt how i had planned it in my head lol . But its all ya gonna get for today.

"event","Greetings my fun filled fellow forum filers&nbsp;

Yesterday was my Birthday. Now i never expect much of a rush on the pressie front given that its always on a bank holiday and the postman doesnt work then. So imagine how unsurprised i was to find sod all in the way of gifts . cards or even Woolworth vouchers being hand delivered by friends and family. Thank god for that .&nbsp;
Look at the money ive saved in return gestures lol?&nbsp;
Many years ago i began to realise that most poeple have a flair if you like for&nbsp;different things,&nbsp;&nbsp;some more than others.&nbsp; Conversly most of us are pretty shite at other things.&nbsp; Now given that i am a self confessed borderline genius, it behoves me to impart that my archilies heel as it where is "" PAINTING""&nbsp; Now if you could actualy lay the bloody wall or cieling that you wanted painting actualy on the floor and didnt mind the occasiona lumpy bit or run here and there . THEN&nbsp;stand the whole thing back up again when it was dry.&nbsp; The chances are i'de still fuck it up lol. So in light of this . i spent my birthday painting my bathroom in lumpy paint.

Oh yeah and the other thing. My beautifull and beloved Pony has new hooves.&nbsp; She will look impossibly gorgiouse in them and leave lovely little hoofy prints in my lawn grrrrrrr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironicly i used to hate hoof prints when i was mountain biking in my every waking moment.&nbsp; Now i miss them with a passion. Ok . bathroom painted (badly)&nbsp;&nbsp; Now i must go make some more floggers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Poeple keep buying em off me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah i know its my job but it would be nice to actualy go to a club, open my box and not get savaged by money weilding wantlings ""bless em lol"" Oh dam i can be an egotistical git sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;But i love me.&nbsp;

Not a feeling i am acustomed to.&nbsp; This is not an egotistic outburst, far from it , bringing up two children on my own and a career in management has embeded this in me by nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this feeling of floundering around at a loose end has got to be addressed . to a degree i have nailed it down and got to the bottom of why it all started. Now i have to dig myself out the other side.&nbsp; We all have to confront demons and self doubt now and then in our lives . and most of us pull it off . I'm bathed in sunlight at the end of the tunnel as write this so its looking good. Just a cpl of things to sort out with a close friend . and bridges to rebuild with another and then were there.

Fear not I am not goping to drag your eyes through yet another load of misery and woe.&nbsp; But I will say this (didnt think you'd get away scott free did ya lol?)&nbsp; I have never been gifted as a phtographer . I have no problems whith this ok ? I accept my failings with grace ( and a few conciliatary pints when possible) However . When i tell someone that i am goiung to do something i go out of my way to make good that proclamation. So yes . I will post some pics . As soon as someone turns up that can take pictures . Cos the little camera&nbsp;I bought the other day doesnt like me very much at all grrrrrrrrrr.&nbsp; Oh yeah,&nbsp; and if anybody reading this owns a battery company that would be realy realy handy too.&nbsp;<br />I am off to see one of my subbies tonight &nbsp;and a new friend in the making . a realy cute TG who is looking to be trained as a pony Wonders where this is gonna lead ??? will keep ya informed on that one . As for subby girl ? Well&nbsp; unless my head space gets more chilled&nbsp;I cant see us playing much.&nbsp; I never play if the heads in pissed off or&nbsp;discontented mode.&nbsp; It just opens the door to bad khama and potential bad play. Classic example the other week when i took my snake to my subby with a freind watching. We all wanted it .&nbsp; But we'd had a realy wierd weekend. No damage done but definately not a good scene. Conclusion ?<br />Huge slap on the wrist for me for being stupid enough to go there with potentialy dangerous toy. Big cuddles and apologies to subby later on for being a twat. After all she was only doing as she was told , plus she loves the snake anyway. And nope i am not gonna put any blame on her for saying yes cos shes still new and i should have known better. Fortunatly my dear freind that was with us was also aware of the whole mind set and we talked about it after at length so thats all sorted. So yes .&nbsp;I have been in the scene a very long time. Know I dont know everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes we all do dumb things now and then.&nbsp; Trick is not to do them to often and dont hurt anybody in the process.&nbsp;<br />right . i'm off .&nbsp;<br />Bye my luvleeeeeeeeees </p>"

"event","Well today started well, took a bit of a nosedive, got better again , then went totaly tits up . and now ? well now i am chuffed to bits.&nbsp;
We started off going to the sea side as it was clear i wasnt going to get any work done with the boys at my heels.&nbsp; Imediately the lights at the end of my road conspired against me. This combined with Vincent forgetting his bloody fone again set my mind in Donkey mode. So off we went home. Although (and this is the exciting bit) we didnt actualy go home . NO . for reasons beyond my ken i decided to visit a DIY store on a Sunday , WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY???????????.&nbsp; In the car park of the affor mentioned store a large vehicle driven by a very very large man and his diminutive but noisy wife decided to trash the back of my car.&nbsp;
As the genetic throwback of a man got out of the car i suspected this could get a tad nasty so i ushered the boys to one side. I was somewhat stunned when the 6'4"" muscle bound slopehead sort of cowered and looked at me while his 5' sod all wife went into one. Its now maybe 8 hours after the incident and i am wondering if shes paused to drawn breath lol. No wonder the big fella has lost the will to fight bless him.

Anyway.. Then we went to see my mum.&nbsp; Or my sweet potato as i like to call her . cos shes almost a vegetable and there the only veg i realy love.&nbsp; Then we did some shopping and gave the bird to all the sunday drivers being pulled over for speeding (jees i am such a cheerfull bastard.&nbsp;)

Now for the realy realy exciting bit . When we got home i decided to make a little something for a friend of mine. Now this isnt a biggie granted . after all thats what i do . make toys right ?&nbsp;
But ti wanted to&nbsp;include a braid that has been eluding me for ever . I even went to a nieghbour and asked her if she could suss it out with the drawings i had downloaded . After an hour she gave up and said it couldnt be done. Guess what ? I did it , yeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaa&nbsp;
The result is a seriously nasty but rather pretty twin tail cat in rawhide. Its got a nifty swivel and the whole thing is finnished with a cherry wood handle. Now of course i am wrestling with my conciense. (Not a problem as i cant even spell it lol) Does my chumly get it or not ?
we will see.&nbsp;
Why have boring days when you can be meeeeeee&nbsp;

I do that and its so&nbsp;annoying . I wish i could turn myself off sometimes and just sleep . After all its one of the things i do remarkably well. A great deal of my ankst is caused by my SAD. For those of you not in the know . this is a thing called ""seasonaly affected dissorder"" Its a form of depression caused by the changes in &nbsp;barometric pressure and so on.

So naturaly i am a lttle nervouse as well.&nbsp; Lots of work to do and to be honest its all a little daunting, but fun.<br />&nbsp;Well yesterday i amused myself making a cpl of nautical toys based on traditional Brittish Navy CP.&nbsp; Damm you gotta love the navy lol. The first one is a piece i have made befor and sold with great success . its real name is a Gunners Starter , so called as it would be made by the offending Gunner from the block ropes used to haul the guns about on decks. The idea being that the poor bugger would have to make the intrement of his own&nbsp;punnishment ( cool huh?) The second little gizmo its once again a traditiona twin tail cat. In my mind far to much emphasis has been given to the 9 tail cat . whilst this was effective it was seldome used on board ship for two reasons.&nbsp; If its made from rope its next best thing to useless unless its weighted on the tips, &nbsp;if this is the case the Matlo (seaman)was usualy to badly wounded to be of any use there after the punnishment . Pluss leather on board was a preciouse comodity so it was unlikely to be used for such menial persuits. Now given that the average sail rigged 3 master would carry about 12 mile of rope , what do you think they used ???<br />the twin tail was a much more effective . easy to make and all round jollier way or stripping the skin from Jack Tars back .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I will pop up a pic of the Gunners Starter. I like to call em the Boatswains Bitch, But then i'm just a perve tee hee.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Oh yeah and last night i found some decent tickets for a trip we are planning . and yep . the other half of the WE was asleep a cpl of hundred miles away with her bloody diary so i called her at an indecent hour this morning just to tell her, arent i wonderfull lol?&nbsp;<br />Just a footnote to a little individual who means the world to me and to whome i have spent far to much time being an asshole and saying sorry to.&nbsp;&nbsp; See how optimistic i am being?

"event","right . heres the deal . as i said . i am not a great writer and dont find putting my feelings and emotions into the written word very easy . so when i am sitting here at 1 o clock in the morning and decide to pour my heart out on here . cos it seemed like a good way of letting off steam and so on .&nbsp;
it realy realy pisses me off when the fuckin thing loses the whole lot .&nbsp;
so i will walk away now and revue the point of this whole thing&nbsp;
to think i actualy did feel better for a very very short while.&nbsp; No realy i did . but that just seems to be the way my blody life is goin at the moment&nbsp;

"event","<p>Well hello everybody. (assumes an audience with the masses lol) It has been sudgested to me by a close friend that i start writing a journal.&nbsp; I felt compelled to say that in the event that you dont see her alive again you will know that it was a bad idea and she has incured my wrath.&nbsp; This statement alone has told you that very&nbsp;few of my personal cock ups are&nbsp;actualy my fault lol.&nbsp; Now we all know that in reality this is seldome true . we are all falible . Some of us are even human albeit that documentary evidence is often hard to come by.&nbsp; Take me for instance (no realy . somebody please take me) Born in london in the year they ended rationing after the war.&nbsp; I atribute my waif like frame to the deprivations incured during the eary years.&nbsp; Been married twice, Well with respect, sometimes one course of aversion therapy doesnt always do the trick right ?&nbsp; I am now blessed with two boys to whome i am the sole carer and parent . Vincent 14 years of age and a lifestyle Goth ( dam good with a flogger and single tail for his age i might add) and of course Joe nearly 10 (shit its his birthday soon grrrrrrr) More about my boys as time goes on ok . Suffice it to say that my lifestyle as a full on bendier than a bent thing from benstville perve cannot and never will compremise my role as a single dad to my boys. So how do i get round that i here you think ?<br />Simple. Ya just give em all the luv en stuff ya can . Oh yeah , and you bring em up in the lifestyle.&nbsp; I have many freinds who have raised kids in the scene and they have turned out to be the most well adjusted , stable and loved kids you ever could meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Moving away from the boys for a sec .&nbsp; i just looked down the page and noticed a box with&nbsp;""mood ""in it&nbsp;. This is my first time remember. Hell . what sort of a mood am i in now ?&nbsp; Well i'le give you a clue,&nbsp;this morning i woke with the feeling that my heart had been ripped out (long story) I am an emotional dweeb ok lol.&nbsp; With my usual gift for sharing my misery . i called the person who got me into this journal gig in the first place and proceeded to bugger her day up and nearly ruin our relationship once and for all .(yes i'm a prick ok duhhhhhhhhh) THENNNNNNNNNNN i get a call from&nbsp;that brought the sunshine back into my life again so i called said freind and went into groveling mode (and i'm supposed to be a DOM? lol). I am seriously considering throwing my mobile away . it will save everybody a lot of grief .Next thing i know i am called upon to drive into the wilderness on my old 750 to give a&nbsp;girl some lessons on how to drive her motorbike (yes i used to be an instructor).&nbsp;Shes getting there but bloody slowly . definately not a natural. and then back to the boys . we went shopping for some bits and bobs for the dungeon and my little treasure Vincent forgets his sodding pin number and gets his ATM card cancelled . He has mild ADD and makes my life ? well interesting to say the least lol. So . My mood ? well i just read through the&nbsp;options and none of em cover my present state of mind.&nbsp; So i will go for . In love . lonely . frustrated . realy realy happy . and full of beans . with maybe a hint of yearning thrown in.&nbsp; Oh yeah . and when she gets to read this . just to piss her off . I miss you.&nbsp;<br />So there ya go . my first journal.&nbsp; If you started reading this and where depressed befor you&nbsp;started . i dare say your suicidal by now lol well tough . wait till i realy get going. tee hee. Byeeeeeeeeeeee&nbsp;<br />and all of you . please take care and play safe ok&nbsp;<br />Trainer Bryan <br />&nbsp;</p>"

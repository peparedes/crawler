"event","I woke up on Friday to the news of the earthquake, and my immediate thought was of my cousin, who was honeymooning on Japan - she and her husband are ok, and hoping to fly out today back to Australia today. So, yay there. The whole thing is rather devastating - I really don't think words can describe how unbelievable it is to me.  As far as I know, I don't have any family (that my grandmother is still in contact with anyway) in Japan, though I know one of my aunts (my great uncle's wife) does, and I'm hoping her family is ok. At this point, I'm just hoping that the people get the relief and aid that they need (I donated to Canadian Red Cross for their relief efforts - I figured it was the least I could do). Still, I find that with this disaster, like every disaster, makes me appreciate everything I have, and that at least for now, all my friends and family are safe.

"event","Insert my obligatory ""I haven't posted in ages"" spiel here.

I've been running for the past month or so in the ""Learn to Run"" group I posted about earlier. It's been going well. We meet on Thursdays, and there's an unofficial group of us that meet on Tuesdays as well, which is good for me, because it's way easier for me to go out and run when I'm meeting up with people. There's someone that's about my pace in the group which is good for me. Considering there are only about 5 or 6 people in my group/level/whatever, it's a nice surprise. Oh, and I finally ran 5 km today, which, while not a huge milestone or anything, felt good to get done. I have a 5 km race next weekend that I somewhat foolishly signed up for last month, so actually running the distance was a good thing for me. At least I know what pace I can run and still finish the race at, if nothing else.

Been watching a lot of the Olympics as well. I have decided I need a pair pants that the the Norwegian Men's Curling team wear (as seen <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61F5JE20100216"">here</a>). Aren't they fantastic? Anyway, I've been staying up far too late to watch some of the events, but oh well. 

What else...my one co-worker still drives me up the wall on occasion, but I'm getting more patient about it. At least the running gives me a chance to bleed off any pent up anger. She's nice, but sometimes...

Oh yes, I got a new stove for the apartment. The old one was, well, old (to quote the guys that brought the new one ""wow that thing is ancient""), and kept blowing its fuses, so they got me a new one which is quite exciting. I can finally use the oven again!

I think...that's about it that's new, or somewhat new with me. Hope you all are having a lovely day.

<i>""This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage."" </i>

So, identical to marriage would be...marriage, yes? Or am I reading that wrong. I mean, even though I disagree with the whole ""Let's ban gay marriages"" thing, I kind of see what law makers were trying to do...but it kind of reads weird.

I was debating posting anything about it, but everytime I come to LJ and see this writer's block, I get pissed off.

The thing is, the way I see it, all this will do is make people feel better about themselves, and how 'not racist' or 'not homophobic', or 'not classist' etc they are. Lip service is easy. It's easy for someone to write about ""this one time, I totally told someone off about whatever"". It's easy for someone to post something about how racism/sexism/homophobia/classism/ageism pisses them off, and how they ALWAYS speak up. It's an easy way for people to feel good about themselves. It's an easy way for people to make the subject all about them, and how awesome they are for speaking up, and to show their f-list how awesome they are.

The fact of the matter is, no one does. I know I don't. I know that I've heard racist jokes (about Asians, no less) and not said anything, even though it bothered me. It's hard to say ""Hey, that bothers me"" when the people are your friends, and you don't want to upset them. It's hard when you know they don't mean to be offensive. It's hard when you don't want to sit down and tell them why it's offensive. It's hard when it's family. It's easy to speak up when someone says, or does something that's blatantly offensive, it's harder when it's not. It's easy to not say something every time someone says ""That's so gay"" when what they really mean is ""That's so stupid"" (n.b. this is an example. I don't really care how many times you speak up about this particular phrase, though I am happy if you do). It's easy to ignore how minorities are stereotyped in the media. These are things that happen everyday, all the time, and I'm willing to bet, everyone, at some point, has ignored.

My point: a lot of people say that they confront the person, but in my experience, it doesn't happen unless it's something really obvious and blatant. Those are the aspects of racism and homophobia people know, and people recognize. Even still, using the ""that's so gay"" example, I think a lot of people know that's kind of wrong, but I don't think a whole whack of people speak up about it all the time. I think people, the very same people that say they always speak up when someone says something racist or homophobic, say a lot of homophobic and/or racist things and don't realise it.

This isn't terribly well written, and my apologies for that. I don't think it addresses everything, and I think that it doesn't necessarily give credit to those that are trying to improve themselves. It's more of a rant, if anything."

"event","So. Update. Not much is new here. I figured I ought to write something, since I haven't for a while.

Um...so...work is work. Not terribly exciting or anything. I miss listening to CBC everyday, since now I get the pleasure of listening to adult contemporary/easy rock/whatever, (and some christian station, though that's only happened once so far) 3 days a week. Although, the last couple of times I've been listening to CBC, I've gotten annoyed, so I dunno. But ergh, the music is crap. I'm pretty indifferent to my job right now. Don't hate it, don't love it. It's work, and experience.

The whole apartment thing is going well. Although, I still miss having a pet and I'm not a huge fan of cooking every night, mostly because I'm lazy. However, I'm working on the pet thing (since I'm allowed to have one. Bonus!), but that's not likely to happen until after the new year, I think. I have friends that live nearby, so we go out/hang out, but not terribly often. Again, we all can be a bit lazy about organizing that kind of thing. Still though, it's nice to have people about.

I guess all in all, life has been fairly dull for me. My sister was home for Thanksgiving, so it was nice to see her. I believe she and her boyfriend are with us this Christmas (they alternate our family and his family for holidays, which seems fair. His family is in Manitoba, so it's not really convenient for them to try to visit both during the holidays).

Anyway, I'll try and update more often, and hopefully with things a little more interesting."

"event","I feel a bit bad, because I've been really quiet and not posting much lately, and not reading a lot of posts lately. Hopefully, I'll get back into the swing of things soon. Work is going well, on Thursday there was a party to welcome the new folks and say bye to the people that were leaving the group. The food was really tasty. For dessert we had one of the best cheesecakes I've had in quite a while. It was sort of mocha-y, and had loose raspberries. It was quite delicious.

I ran my first 5 km race in at least 5 years tonight (well, technically 'last' night I suppose), which was fairly painless. Finished in under a half-hour which was all I really wanted, since I just started running again about a month ago. It's difficult to find the time to run right now, since I'm pretty tired after work. Or rather, my feet are since I spend a lot of the day standing, but I'm not so great at going to bed a bit earlier and waking up earlier to run in the morning (plus, the last time I did that I got kind of tired part-way through the day). So we'll see. I just bought a new pair of shoes, so I'm committed now.

Anyway, I'm off to Grand Bend this weekend, so I best be getting to bed soon. Hope you all are doing well!

<lj-cut text=""The reason I am not too upset. Uh...squick alert? involves, uh, dead animals"">
The job was with a company that produces (or manufacturers, whatever) a surfactant for premature babies. It's actually the most widely used surfactant for this purpose in Canada. Anyway, part of this job would entail collecting bovine lung surfactant, and would involve, uh, being on a kill floor all day once a month and collecting it from carcasses. Which kind of squicked me. And I know that it's hypocritical of me - I do eat meat. But yeah, I think it's a blood thing more than a dead animal thing (though that isn't exactly appealing either).
</lj-cut>

Other than that, not much is new. I'm still looking for a job, which is not that much fun at all. I have applied to some companies in private industry, but I'm not sure how well that will go because a lot of places here have a hiring freeze at the moment, so I'm finding a lot of my applications are going to the university or grant/funding based jobs. We'll see though. I'm not keen on Toronto, but it looks like I'll have to start applying there, unless something comes up in the places I do want to work. We'll see I guess.

Oh. I've also become addicted to watching documentaries on YouTube. Uh, mostly serial killers/evil cult leaders and, uh, stuff like that. I don't know. I think I was in a weird mood when I started.

The term is almost over, so barring me completely bombing a course (which with the percentage of my grade already completed, is really unlikely - unless I got like...10% on a final, there's no way I failed anything), I'm done school as soon as I'm done my exam tomorrow. So that's exciting. The term had its ups and downs - the group project with the useless partner was a definite down but one of my lab courses was really fun, and I did really well in at least 2 (probably at least 3) courses. Immunology was a struggle mostly because my instructor was kind of crappy. One of my professors took us out for drinks for our final class (we had nothing scheduled for it - it was a presentation course, and we had finished the week before), which was kind of cool. He paid for everything, which we didn't expect at all! It was really nice of him - we were all like ""HOLY CRAP"" after we found out. There's only 10 of us in the class, but still, it was really nice. Although I don't think we would have had quite so much if we knew he was paying for it. Anyway, I'm almost done school, which is rather exciting.

I have a couple of interviews coming up, which is sort of exciting. One is way on the other side of the city (it's for a company that purifies surfactant for premature babies), which is a bit of a pain, and it's early-ish (9:00 am), so hopefully it goes well. The other one is at LHSC in a lab. It would be for 4 months, with the possibility of an extension, if the other person (who has been away on sick leave for almost a year) isn't back, or can't be back full time. Hopefully those go well. I have this dillemma of not knowing which one to hope for - the first job is sort of out of the way for me, at least right now, and isn't 100% what I want to do (but who's first job is?), but it's pretty much guaranteed to be a longer contract, if I don't screw up. The one at the LHSC is more what I love to do (which is lab work), but will likely be shorter contract, and the length of it is sort of up in the air. So...yeah. I'm trying not to worry about it though, since I haven't even interviewed yet."

It doesn't sound bad on the surface, but right now we are putting together a budget for our equipment, and I can't find what I'm looking for on the internet, which means I will probably have to call all these places and say ""ok, I have this stupid school project and I need to you tell me the cost of your bioreactor/feed system/whatever"" My partner has done jack all for part of her section, and I'm tempted just to email my professor and say ""look. This is my section. This is her section. I am not doing her work, because I do not have time, and quite frankly, do not care""  Right now  I'm pissed off, and I'm tired, we aren't doing my idea for this stupid project (it's my partner's idea) so I don't care much about the subject. I'm just so frustrated, and our professor isn't much help.

If anyone knows how much it would cost for a 500 L bioreactor for mammalian cells (fed batch, suspension culture, quite frankly I don't even care just get me a quote), and a pilot size ultrafiltration unit I would be grateful if you told me. Right now I am sort of looking at <a href=""http://www1.gelifesciences.com/aptrix/upp01077.nsf/Content/wave_bioreactor_home~wave_bioreactor~system_500_1000"">this</a> and  <a href=""http://www.nbsc.com/bioflopro.aspx"">this</a> one. I have no idea when I'm going to have time to call, unless they have someone available on weekends.

This is so stupid."

I think what I love about this video si that it sort of says a lot about what I'm thinking - I'm happy about Obama being president, but it does not satisfy me. It does not mean the US (or any country) is post-racial when they have a minority president. The work isn't done, racism still exists, a huge step toward Martin Luther King's dream, but it has not been realized.

Um, yes. The video is about 3 minutes long."

"event","So...last night in a feminist thread in a forum (which I was debating responding to in the first place because my feminist experience is intertwined with PoC experience, is intertwined with my LGBT experience, and wasn't entirely sure how to enter the conversation because I wasn't sure how my responses might be taken, since I can't talk about my feminist experience without the other two. Anyway the thread itself fairly superficial thus far), I had made the comment that I am not entirely comfortable right now calling men feminists (pro-feminist, supporters of feminism, yes) because they benefit from the system (I'm not saying that you have to agree with me, it's just my personal...belief, right now) and I got the response:

<i>I guess I disagree that they are benefiting from the system, so it's easier for me to include them. I feel the same way about racism.</i>

And...I'm not entirely sure how to respond to that. I mean, my first thought was ""Well, clearly you're not a PoC"", (well, and white people don't benefit from institutional racism? Really?) but figured that wasn't the way to respond. I think that...they see sexism and racism as things that are generally overt, rather than covert. I don't want to veer the thread into a different direction, and turn it into a wankfest, but on the other hand I can't really leave that comment alone."

Anyone that compares the Civil Rights movement of the 60's to the Gay Rights movement of today (beyond the fact that they are both civil rights movements) doesn't own their privilege. I truly believe that - by comparing the two movements, we disregard how these intersect. Believe it or not, there are members of minority groups that are gay.

And another thing - why the Civil Right's movement? Why not the Women's movement? Is it because more people realize that a comparison of those two movements (gay rights and women's rights)  is ridiculous?"

"event","Hey all.

Not much new here - I'm still loving work, which is awesome. My supervisor is having me learn a lot of stuff, and do a lot of techniques, which is really good. I'm also digging the weekly pay thing, though it's sort of depressing that I make about the same amount in a week that I made in a month waiting tables (admittedly, the restaurant was small, and I only worked one day a week. Still). Once a month we have 'cake day' which is basically an excuse to get together and socialize for about an hour in the afternoon. And eat cake (obviously). I've met a few more people in the department that are around my age, which is sort of cool. They were going out last night for Halloween, but I couldn't go, because I so much crap to do for school, I couldn't justify losing (at least) half a day on Saturday recovering, because, even if I didn't drink that much, I'd still be up stupid late. I know that sounds lame, but I just know that if I did go out I'd have fun, but I'd be a stressball the rest of the weekend, which is less cool.

School is going ok. I'm doing well in all my classes, except one, which is going to be my nemisis this term. It mostly difficult because it's not a subject I'm too interested in (it's about bioprocesses, which I know is important for the production of some metabolites/enzymes, and more importantly alcohol, the subject, or at least the way it's being taught is dead boring). I am finding it hard though, to keep on top of things - with work and school, I can balance it more or less ok, but I tend to be sacrificing sleep to get stuff done sometimes, which can make things tough.

I'm still trying (and failing) to step back from the US election - just a lot of stupid shit has been said that pisses me off, but there's too much for me to actually make a coherent post.

I'm thinking of linking to, and writing some of my own thoughts/experiences on obw's Ways to Offend list (like...linking to the post on the blog, and then expanding here on my experiences on the, uh, way to offend). Well, once I have time to, anyway.

Oh. And dragons.

"event","Not a great day today - I had period issues
<lj-cut text=""I'll cut and be nice"">
Normally every other month I have a light period (the other months being heavier flow) and this month started out light-ish - and 3 days in, I get blindsided with cramps, and I think my uterus tried to void itself or something, then implode. Extremely uncomfortable, because I totally didn't see it coming, and it struck about 45-minutes or so into a test. Yeah. That was all kinds of fun. Thank God for Divacup!  So a bus-ride home, praying I wasn't going to be ill (or die), a whack of drugs and a hot bath later, I was mostly functional again. </lj-cut>

What else. Work is going well, I think. I miss having the time off to veg and work on school stuff, but I'm enjoying the work, which is good. And I get to pick up my paycheque tomorrow :D

"event","So first things first, I guess. I finished my job at the restaurant, which pleases me. I'll miss some of the customers, but there are a lot of things I won't miss (being perpetually short-staffed, peopel thinking I'm Chinese, people saying ""when did you come here, your English is so good!"", people asking me where I'm from...). I almost feel bad because the other girl that I work with up and quit with no notice...but on the other hand, I gave my two weeks. Plus, my new job starts next week, and I wouldn't really have time for both.

I'm may be looking for a laptop - I'm (tentatively) planning on purchasing one in the next month or so (as in, at the end of October-ish), which is sort of exciting.Thoughts on where to go/what to get? I do like the Macbook and (especially the) Macbook Pro, even with student pricing, they are a bit out of the planned budget, of about a grand (the macbook is very close though). Plus, everything else I use is a PC and don't need compatibility angst. That said, I do like them. The other plus is that if I stay in research and in the biology field Macs seem to be the computer of choice (at least here), and it could potentially be more handy in the future.

In the other corner is PC, which I'm used to, can get XP pro and Office 2003 discs from my mom's work which would eliminate any Vista/Office 2007 (or 2008?) angst that may develop. I'm leaning toward Dell right now, but my dad might be able to get HP ones through work at cost which, of course, is tempting if he can, especially if it means I can buy something with specs that would normally be outside my price range. I'm leaning toward PCs, partly because of the familiarity, and partly because I do like the idea of being able to, essentially, custom build what I want on the Dell site (well, within my budget. That being said, the first time I played I wound up with a laptop that would cost about 2 grand. Whoops).

I'm a bit angsty about what to do with my desktop - whether I should keep it or not. I like the freedom and convenience of a laptop, but when I want to do work, I like the desktop - I think because I can't take it somewhere comfortable where I'd do less studying.

Thoughts? Recommendations?

The other big step I may be taking is buying (my first) cell phone. I figured I should join the 21st century with the rest of you. So, Canadians - service provider recommendations? Anyone dealt with Roger's? I'm currently looking at them, because AFAIK Bell and Telus are the two with the stupid text message charge (unless that has changed?). Not that I'm planning to do or recieve much texting, but still. Anyway. Yes. Phone recs, and for Canadians, service provider recs."

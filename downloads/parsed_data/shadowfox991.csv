As much as I hate the circumstances, it was nice to talk to Brett again.

I really thought he was gonna be one of the people I never saw/talked to again.

Anyways,

I really believe Lauren and what she says.

It's just a major shame that while she gives good advice and has a lot of insight, she's truly unable to use it on herself.

I'm exhausted.

On the plus side, I finished my blogger.

I'll do that later.

Pineapple Express was hilarious. It was one of those movies that you just feel stupid/stoned watching and cracking up to.

And James Franco as a totally stoned drug dealer who loved his ""bubbe""? AMAZING :)

Hahahahahaha

Side note: Happy Birthday Kelly!


Well

I guess that's it for my pseudo exciting life.

Gonna hit up CVS, Wal-Mart and/or Target, the thrift store and Charlotte Russe before I leave.
I need me some pictures, coffee mugs, Sherlock Holmes wear, and a scarf :D

Random.

Not being in school/not having a schedule has totally messed with my sense of time/sleep/hunger.

Anyways.

I'm thinking of getting a blogger, but I've devoted so much time to this old thing that I don't think I can discard it just yet.

Actually, I think I can.

It can be the ultimate step in my search for self.

Come September 21st, or whenever I get online after that, this thing will close down.

It will still be here, but I'm not going to update it. Never again.

I'll get a blogger and use that and strictly that for my blogging needs.

When I create it, I'll post the link here as my last livejournal entry.

It's high time I throw out some of the negative crap this thing holds. Sure life isn't always gonna be happy happy sunshine.

But it's like a tree. You can't expect the tree to flourish and grow if you don't trim back the dead parts every so often.

Wow, I'm getting my life philosophies from books I haven't read in ages [Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson I think, though I'm probably wrong]

I love those little fleeting moments when you realize you know/remember more than you thought.

Like earlier today I was&nbsp;driving and listening to Audioslave and I was like,&nbsp;dang&nbsp;what band did the frontman come from&nbsp;again?

And randomly I was like ""Oh yeah, Soundgarden!"" and then&nbsp;I was like dude no, that&nbsp;can't be right? Soundgarden? Psht.

So I&nbsp;looked it up on wikipedia right now and I was like hey! Chris Cornell of&nbsp;Soundgarden :D

"event","<p align=""center"">So after reading Todd's blog describing his side of the story on the break-up of <strong>I Was a Cub Scout</strong>, I was surprised to say the least.<br />Will put it in such gentler terms. With a vague pass-over of how the two of them didn't really want to work together anymore and for the sake of themselves, they broke up and moved on to other projects.<br /><br /><img height=""310"" alt="""" width=""479"" align=""middle"" src=""http://a378.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/12/l_a8d5868bf9c4ae27b7ab07c85bf3ce11.jpg"" /><br /><br />Todd's story told something different. About how he did most of the work, and how Will was just a drummer who drummed out Todd's beats. That, I can believe. Sad as it is, Todd <em>did</em> run the project by himself before William came along and it pretty much was <em>his</em> project.<br />Anyways, the more I read, the more shocked I became.<br /><br />Todd described a disagreement about two things<br />1. the music<br />2. the drugs.<br /><br />He claimed they both had different ideas about being musicians. Todd said he did not like the limelight, he preferred to play for the music and just that. William, he said, liked the rock-star lifestyle, the fame, the fans and the promo shots.<br />I can start to understand that, but I wonder how much is true versus how much is just a bitter/angry ex-bandmates rantings.<br /><br />The second bit, now that shocked me. I thought that William was the problem, since he enjoyed the cliched rock-star lifestyle, but apparently I was wrong.<br />Todd was/is the one with the problem. He didn't like William calling him out on his ""addictions"" and stated that his problems were just that, his problems.<br /><br />Disillusionment is running amok!<br /><br />Here I was, thinking Todd was the ass, then William and now I'm left wondering what side to believe and what elements to take out of either story.<br /><br />Todd's blog defended his ""so-called addictions"" and shot out jabs at William.<br />William's blog stated that the two were no longer friends.<br /><br />If Todd's blog is true, well then, I guess that's the gory insides of a band break-up no one would like to see.<br />If it's not, then who knows what really happened.<br /><br />All I can say, is I'm not sure what went wrong with IWACS exactly, but I do know I'll mourn it's passing.<br /><br />Even if the two of them hated each other, they made brilliant music.<br /><br /><br />Sidenote, there's a slow moving fly or a very tiny bee in my house<br />I just kicked it out of my room but I suppose I need to go find and murder it.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.greenparty.ca/files/images/elmer-fudd.gif"" />&nbsp; <font size=""7"">+ <img style=""WIDTH: 223px; HEIGHT: 296px"" height=""397"" alt="""" width=""300"" src=""http://blogs.chron.com/tmi/simpBumblebeeMan_f.JPG"" /></font><br /><br />xxxx </p>"

So today was ""fun""

The farrier came earlier this morning and so Bobkatz has naked feet and they're nice and trimmed. But I still didn't want to ride him (in case they were sensitive still).
Anyways, Georgia brought home some samples of grain to help him put on weight from the vet so I tried to give him one today.

He was <i>soooo</i> psyched that had grain for him. He was nickering, trotting back and forth along the fence waiting for me to give him some, so I poured the packet into one of the mares' feed pans and slid it under the fence.

Bobkatz, stuck his nose straight in...and started sniffing. And sniffing. He kept sniffing and he kept nudging the pan and trying to tip it over and I was like ""Dude! Stop!"" but he still managed to pour like half of it out onto the groun and I was like ""yeah you are an idiot :|""

So I tried mixing in Equine Senior to get him to eat but no go. He made this whole head jerky neck stretching motion everytime he got a bite of the fattening stuff. His way of saying ""OMG this is sooo YUCKY""

I was like =|


So since he wouldnt eat that, I gave him a serving of the mares' grain hoping he might accidently eat some of the other stuff too.
So I ended up sitting there in the shade in his pasture as he ate. He slobbered all over me and still wouldn't eat the fattening grain. Then he came over and sniffed me and was like ""Hey, why are you sitting here? This is my place!"" and I was like ""Dude :|"" and he was like ""So, when you gonna feed me?"" and I was like =| x 2. 
Then I go to put the scoop for the mare's feed back and I leave him alone for literally 10 seconds as I walk from his pasture to the mares' (right next to his!) and put the scoop in the bin again. I turn around and the feed pan is upside down. 

<big> =| </big>

He's sooo frustrating some times. I still love him to death but seriously. Haha.

Anyways, the fourth was fun at Amanda's. Played some volleyball (humiliating myself tons), swam a bit, took some adventurous walks to parks, played with Maggie, pet Maggie, let Maggie sit on my lap when she was scared of fireworks (hahaha), watched Step Up (HAHA), watched illegal fireworks, and watched Criminal Minds with Blake constantly going ""Are you gonna leave yet?!?! I'M TIRED"" and his friend hitting on the random TV characters. Hahaha


Anyways, gotta wake up early again tomorrow possibly teach Lauren to ride Bobkatz (while Georgia's out of town.. Shhhhh!)


I love this new video and I've officially fallen in love with KIGH and Aled who is an amazing vocalist and hilarious blogger.

You are rational enough to see every part of a problem. You are great at giving other people advice.<br />

You are friendly, charming, and warm. You get along with almost everyone.<br />
You work hard not to rock the boat. Your easy going attitude brings people together.<br />

You are very intuitive and wise. You understand the world better than most people.<br />
You also have a very active imagination. You often get carried away with your thoughts.<br />
You are prone to a little paranoia and jealousy. You sometimes go overboard in interpreting signals.

"event","Rode BK today

Picked up the right lead on the first try I was so proud :D
We had some trouble the second time but we'll work on that.

Waking up at 7 tomorrow :O so I can join the trail ride at like 9 haha

It's pretty awesome having my ""own"" horse this summer :)

Learned what to do with the old mares too haha, reminds me of Lady and Marie only these too (Lacey and TJ) are spunkier than Lady and Marie.

Anywho, my legs are all jelloid. I'm going to have the strongest calves out there by the end of summer what with walking Koda every night for like 2miles and riding Bobkatz.

Anywho, I'm tired.

What a cutie :D

"event","Rode BK again today :D
He was a bit jumpy on trail but it's probably just because he hasn't been ridden in a week. 
My mom thinks he's gorgeous which makes me happy and he was a major sweetie. I can tell he and I are going to be quite good friends, considering I signed the lease and he's mine til Sept 3. Oh we better be good friends. ha.

Anywho, 'stead of paying $30 a month to use her tack I've just gotta help her groom and bathe some old mares she has. Going to go check em out tomorrow and learn what I've gotta do.

Anyways...

Time for dinner then Koda and I will trek it again.


I'm feeling so amazingly light right now. I hope nothing kills it :]



Well, Nikka dropped it a few points but I guess I've just got to accept the fact that she's stolen one of my best friends :/

As long as Bridget's happy I s'pose :(


To end on a happy note, BK is mine :D


Cheers!"

"event","<p>So while it may seem stupid to say, I've come to quite the realization.<br /><br />There is <em>no perfect horse. <br /><br /></em>Even if you manage to find a push button show pony, he or she are still likely to have their off days.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/steerclear/perfect.jpg"" /><br />[cheers to <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/steerclear"">Steer Clear</a>&nbsp;for that icon]<br /><br />It's all about skill and effort and teamwork. I will never find the one horse that I hop onto and glide off into the sunset. My calves will still ache when&nbsp;I hop off him/her, sweaty and covered in dirt at the end of the day.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not sure why that hit me now, but I have been daydreaming of some idealistic horse that I could hop onto and magically fly over the jumps with. But there will always be a struggle. Echo is not the only one who refuses jumps. I'm sure Bobkatz will be the same way. He may not rush them like Echo or refuse them like Breezy but it won't just be perfect (especially since he has never really jumped before). But that's besides the point. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrk4Zk_cZZc"">Hidden Creek's Perin</a>&nbsp;is probably not the easiest horse to ride in the world. He has his days. I think that's what makes a good rider. Just like in any other sport or game, they can make it look effortless.<br /><br /><br /><br />Someday, I want to make it look effortless.<br /><br />And the compliments from Kim and Georgia when I went to try out Bobkatz, even though they weren't over the top and were just ""You have&nbsp;a good seat and soft hands"", those were some&nbsp;of the nicest, best things I've ever heard about myself.<br /><br /><br /><br />Scratch that line up there.<br /><br />Someday I <em>will</em> make it look effortless.</p>"

"event","Major bummer <br /><br />My parents haven't even decided what to get me for my grad present yet, which sucks because I seriously thought that they had. <br /><br />And my mom offered to pay a month of leasing Bobkatz so I told her it was only $330 and of course her response ""I can't afford that""...Well what did you think it was? $26 or something?! <br /><br />She never really has understood how much riding means to me. She thinks that after 8 years (only like 2 of which I actually took lessons) I can just stroll up to Davis and be offered the best spot on the team? At this rate I'm not even going to qualify for taking the intermediate level CLASSES let alone even MAKE the team. <br /><br />And then offering to buy me a used saddle (which she doesn't realise would cost just about as much as a month of Bobkatz) or offering me a month of riding lessons (what good would that do? I'd get to ride 4 times and by the time they actually started to know me/my style I'd be leaving. BIG help mother). <br /><br />And then there's the worst part. No London for me. It seems, ever. Anyone who knows me knows I'm pretty much beyond obsessed with the UK. They practically&nbsp;<em>promised</em> me that like 7 years ago. I know it's expensive but they bought Lauren a laptop for her graduation! That's almost $1000! and going to London for one week by myself is LESS than that! I figured out all the costs! I'm not stupid!<br /><br />I think I'm just beyond upset now. It hurts when the only things you really want in life, the only things you've thought, dreamed, hoped, wished about for literally YEARS are the only things your parents won't help you out with and don't seem to believe your dedication to.<br /><br />I'm really more than half tempted to call up Georgia tomorrow and <em>regardless</em> of my parents' decision, tell her that I am going to lease Bobkatz.<br /><br /><br />I <strong>need</strong> to ride. And I'm sick of always feeling so second rate to the Randie Adams, Natalie Swaugers, Kailyn Enrights, Sadie Hutchisons of the world. Just because I haven't got the money to ride shouldn't mean I have less of a chance of going anywhere than them."

"event","<p>Graduation went by so quickly! I can't believe it's already over.

They pronounced my middle name wrong but whatever. Muhlorie 'stead of MAllory. Oh well.

Anyways, grad night was tons of fun.

There was a massive mob scene and we got groped but it was fun being amongst friends. Space mountain was fun as well.
And then we ate haha and paid $10 for a lame piece of pizza and bottle of water. Oh well.

Then we hit up thunder mountain which was fun and we all were surprised it was so long haha. We all just kept expecting it to end. We also hit up the haunted mansion ""Bridget HOLD ME"" and some girl ""OMG it's actually a RIDE? I thought you just walked through it..."" hahaha

Then Splash Mountain with Brett, Maggie and Bridget. Brett's girly scream was amazing, even if we got wet. The Alice in Wonderland ride was fun and trippy ""Pip pip driver, have you been drinking?""  ""...yeah..."". Teacups cramming into one haha, spinning like mad then one by one all of us getting nauseous haha. The hat shop and Katherine and I's Buzz Lightyear vs Zurg hats. The carousel at dawn! Losing Amanda and Brett in the orgy only to find them on the other side buying coffee (as we waited, worrying). Tons of other random fun stuff I don't remember.

Finally getting our diplomas this morning, then going to Coyote Cafe for some effing delicious pancakes. Then coming home and crashing and sleeping for like 5hrs. Then ""partying"" with Lauren. Ha. We ate pizza and watched 1408. But we figure 1406 would be WAY better as a movie. Hahaha

""Come on they gotta show it.. *camera pans to 1406*..1406 WOO!!!!""

Haha anyways, sleepiness is taking over.

Oy and <strong>Rest In Peace</strong> the following bands:
Blue Sky Summer: 2005-May 29, 2008 [thomas left the band, the others followed shortly after. Roo officially announced the split on the 31st]
Ivory:  2005-June 21, 2008  [their last show]
Reuben:  1998-June 4, 2008 [announced hiatus, not completely through but possibly]
I Was A Cub Scout:  2005-July 14th 2008 [their last show together, though they announced the split on 6/5/08]

I think I could cry over them. Blue Sky Summer got royally fucked when their van was robbed. I'm sure a ton of fans could kill those thiefs for forcing the band apart so quickly. I'm sure it was coming, but the robbery was a catalyst. Ivory just wasn't the same when Nathaniel moved to NYC. Reuben was a massive surprise, but technically there's still hope since they're on a break. Not much though. and I Was a Cub Scout is also shocking. I guess Will and Todd just don't want to work together anymore which makes me really sad. I just started to really get into them too.

Major depression found from those.
Esp since Ivory and Reuben were among my most favorite of bands. And BSS was pretty high up there (in the pyramid of perfection probably around the 2nd or 3rd row from the top). And IWACS was getting there.

I'm just praying that Max, Josh, Ant, and JamesLukeBenMikeScott's bands don't split anytime soon. Or Enter Shikari [but they're recording a new album so I'm not worrying too much now]. But seriously if any of them decided to call it quits, or dsp or FDH and TMS and all of them? I would seriously freaking cry. Love those bands way too much :(

Happier thoughts? I love this video. It's so entrancing.

"event","2AM, and the chart I pick up says ""penis pain"".  Of course - these things always come in at 2am.  Most cases are young guys with a drip, but then I notice this gentleman is in his early 50s.  His story is he has not been able to pass any urine for over 12 hours, and his penis is swollen.  He opens the robe for his exam, and I find the strangest thing.  He's uncircumsised - which is not so unusual,  and he can not retract his forskin due to a tight stricture of the skin at the tip of his penis (something called phimosis) - again not so unusual.  What IS odd, is his foreskin looks tight and is very swollen and hard, as though there is a small lime or golf ball tucked up within his foreskin.  Having never seen anything like this, I call the other doc on that night to take a look.  Neither of us can figure out what this could be.  Too tender to really get a good feel for what's in there, we can just tell it's hard, is stretching the skin tight, and is VERY sensitive.  I decide to try to put a catheter in his penis (a tube that goes up into the bladder to drain urine), but his foreskin is constricted SO tight, I can't even get a catheter in there.  There's only one thing to do - call the urologist on call and have him come in to see just what this thing is.  Needless to say, NO ONE likes to be called into the emergency room at 2am, much less a surgeon who has cases scheduled starting at 6!!!  When the urologist looks, he's not even certain what to think.  Of course this guy's got a full bladder and needs a catheter, so the urologist decides to use dilaters to stretch the opening of the foreskin to allow a catheter to pass.  Dilaters look like polished mettal rods about 8"" in lenth, and each end has a dull tip.  They range in size from the size of a pencil lead to about that of a human finger.  The urologist takes the smallest one and forces it an inch or so into the end of the foreskin.  The patient YELLS, and then as the dilater is withdrawn, urine begins to flow.  Turns out this guy's phimosis was SO restricted, it wouldn't even allow urine to pass!  His foreskin shrank down like a balloon and the pt began to have a relief.  So if you ask me about circumcision, I always used to say the ritualistic mutilation of an infant's genitalia was barbaric and should be considered a felonious assault.  But now . . . . I'm begining to have second thoughts!"

"event","It's one o'clock in the morning when this young girl decides to go home after having WAY too many drinks, and most likely a few chemicals in her system.  She gets to her home and stumbles up to the door which has a large full length pane of plate glass.  While searching for her keys, she looses balance and falls right through the glass door.  She gets up, wipes the glass off, gets undressed and goes to bed.  At 7am she wakes up in a VERY bloody bed and calls 911.  From 7:30 in the morning till 5pm at night, she's in the ER getting shards of glass taken out of her - first the most superficial pieces by ER technicians (orderleys), then a few deeper ones by nurses, then even deeper pieces (requiring local anesthesia) by the ER doc.  Finally most pieces are out, but there are a few very deep pieces in her back, so a plastic surgeon is called in, who locates the peices by ultrasound and X-rays and removes them in the OR.  The FINAL PIECE is removed from her back - the largest and deepest one yet, and then things start going downhill.  Blood pressure drops, X-rays show blood collecting in the chest.  Chest tubes are place and the pt is put on life support and transfered to a trauma hospital for immediate thoracotomy (opening of the chest cavity).  The very tip of that last shard of glass had made it all the way in to the chest cavity and had been sitting inside an artery in the girls lung.  Once it was removed it was like removing the cork from a bottle of Champagne - everything began to flow.  Frightening just how wrong things can go.  We've all had those nights where we've had one too many . . . yet came through it with nothing worse than a bad headache the next morning.  As far as the girl goes, she made it, but will have plenty of scars to remind her of the night she had one too many."

"event","It's 3:30am in a busy ER and I'm down to the last three and a half hours of my shift.  I pick up the next chart and see it's a man sent in from the nearby nursing home with a possible fractured hip.  The note says the guy fell out of bed 2 days ago, had an X-ray taken yesterday, then was sent to the ER this morning (at 3am???) for evaluation of a broken hip.  Now typically when you see someone coming in from a nursing home, ESPECIALLY at 3am, they turn out to be a real ""GOMER"" (get outa my emergency room).  A mere shell of a human being with a long list of medical problems and an even longer list of medications, who has about a hundred reason to be kept in the hospital for the rest of their life.  Imagine my surprise when I walk into the room and there is a man in his late 60s, fully aware and concious, who can give me the full story of what happened.  Turns out this guys has double BKAs (Below Knee Amputations - no lower legs) and had rolled out of bed a couple days ago right onto the floor.  He landed on his hip and just thought he had bruised it, but the pain kept getting worse, hence the X-ray and trip to the ER.  I'm so pleased to have a patient who can hold a conversation I begin to chat with the gentleman.  Turns out his renal failure had left him with poor circulation in his lower legs, which eventually became infected and caused them to need to be amputated.  Since he was a lifelong bachelor with no children to help care for him, he was forced to live in the nursing home.  One leg had been taken a year ago, and the second was just amputated last month.  What really bothered the man was that his extended hospital stays had caused him to retire from a job he loved and had been doing for over the past 40 years.  ""What was that""  I asked.  ""I've been fitting people for prosthesis for amputated limbs since I was about 20"" the man said."

"event","Before me is a blank slate and it's up to me to fill it in.  Part therapy, and part the pure need to express myself, I hope to turn the keystrokes of my computer into a web of stories to interest others.  My twist?  I'm an emergency doctor.  No shit.  Work in a real live ED (emergency department).  It's great work, but at times you just get frustrated with your specie and wonder ""Why the hell is this person here?"" and ""What the hell do they expect from me?"".  So my plan is to purge my brain of all the frustration after some of my longer shifts by logging in and blogging away.  

Let me set a few facts on the table.  Fist, I love my job . . . I mean I LOVE it.  It's rewarding on so many different levels, and always a challenge, NEVER boring.  Second, I really try to be sympathetic to all my patients.  I do my best to remain professional at all times.  Even when I want to shout, I hold it in . . . until now.  Now I have a journal to lay all my frustrations upon.  Somewhere to let loose that primal scream I hold back at 3am when the local drunk shows up faking a seizure in the hopes of getting a bed for the night.  Someplace where I can scream in print ""Your sweet little 19 year old girl has gonorrhea . . . AGAIN!"".  Someplace where I can let loose all the terrible things my mind thinks about but can't be said during my 12 hour shifts.

Let's start this off by getting acquainted a bit, shall we?  In order to better understand my viewpoint on some of the stories I'll share here, you should know a few things about me.  First of all, I work in what is known as an ""under served area"", which is a politically correct way of saying ""Ghetto"".  Which is fine with me, after all, I grew up in a neighborhood very much like the one I now work in.  I was raised in a lower-middle class family, went to the local public school where most of the other white kids were bussed in in order to meet the racial quotas.  I spent 4 years enlisted in the military before ever starting college.  I've been poor, and I've been well off - and well off is much better.  I'm currently 40 years of age, and in a long term relationship with my husband of 7 years.  Yes . . . I said HUSBAND.  I'm a man, he's a man, it's not recognized by George W. Bush, but I have a husband.  Are you getting the picture here???  40 year old gay white doctor who has a blue collar background and works in the hood.  Oh . . . and the ""Dr Teddy Bear"" part . . . they really do call that at work.  I'm shaped sort of like a teddy bear (""Husky"" I like to call it), I'm fairly furry, and I have a light hearted disposition - you'll almost always find me smiling.

Welcome to my Journal - I hope you find it entertaining."

"event","Isn't it funny where life takes you! The downs...the ups! It's all worth it in the end because i know who my real friends are. And for the first time in a while I really know who I am! The people in my life are amazing each and everyone of them. Two of them in particular have flipped my world upside down. But what they don't realize is that they have done something to me that makes me want to be a better person. No one has ever done that for me. Its been the best week of my life guys. Thank you ...... I would say that you have no idea. But thats the thing you do. You know me the whole me. And once we broke down one wall the rest came crumbling down. But it happen to all three of us. im so glad I have you guys.
             Goodnight........God Damn It......4:30 am again....no sleep! It was worth it"

"event","Thank god someone finally kicked my ass! i've been on a rollercoaster ride. In 7 days it's taken me from my highest highs to my lowest lows. I usually have it all together....all the time. im not a crier! I never cry in front of people. I was taught that to cry was showing weakness. Well let me tell you this weekends water works were unbelievable. I had thoughts in my heaad that even scared me. God nows why my friends put up with that bullshit. They probably think in crazy. Well I am i guess. Anyway Today was a wonderful day! It was beautiful outside ! i had an awsome day at work! Which is a first....cause i had to open the store up by myself. But i figured everything out. 
    OK people Im back and better then ever! I learned more things in 7 days then i have in my whole life. Mostly about myself. I think it was what i needed! Thanks for kicking my ass!
     Love yeah for it!"

"event","You know ...great things happen everyday it just a matter of stepping back and seeing them! A weekend that started off with a mental break ended up being the best weekend ive had here. I learned one of the biggest lessions from a  source i never excpect. When you let go ...and let people in.....wonderful things happen. I just want to say thanks you to 2 guys.(you know how you are) I love you both and thank you for showing me the light at the end of the tunnel. That was chessy I know but...i can't help it its true. To Alex thank you for being you ...and for showing me im not alone. I only wish I could find the right words. But its like you know with out me even saying it. And to Aaron , thank you for showing me that positivity can change a persons life. And that sunglasses can be worn stylishly at night....lol."

"event","So I'm up ...and my mind is wondering. Filled with things I have to do: homework that has to get done....work and the list just keeps going. But I have to stop and ask myself why? Why am I existing like this ...not having one second to just stop and stand still? i wish i had that....hopefully after tomorrows class I have some time to think. But my mind is just so cluttered that I don't know were to start or even if any of this makes cents. I just feel like for the past week I've been this ball that hasn't stopped rolling. Running on no sleep...and just trying to make everything work out while keeping the people around me happy. And I just keep going because if i don't ill probably have a break down. I don't like showing my weaknesses . I guess that comes from my dad, my whole life i heard ""suck it up."" Well i can't suck it up any more. I want  to go back to the way I was . having time for me and enjoying my friends and always on top of things. But really this is the first time in my life that im just flying by the seat of my pants. It seems every new day comes with more things I forgot ... I need to get my shit together. Like Im balancing on the line of sanity, any sudden movements could send me over the edge. I hate that so much. As much as I like living in the moment ,I need structure.  Can't wait for the madness to end!"

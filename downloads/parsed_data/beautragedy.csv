When you're young, you're young and you don't know any better about alot of things.&nbsp; Well, watching t.v., having big brothers that are like, 10 and 16 years older than you, and having affectionate parents, I thought that people were supposed to kiss people.&nbsp; I thought it was a good thing to do.&nbsp; Well, I had as much of a crush as a Kindergardener of the age of 5 can have, on this little African American boy named Trey.&nbsp; He could draw really well, and I just thought he was the coolest person.&nbsp; So, one day, I decided to kiss him.&nbsp; So, I tackled him, held him down against his will and tried to kiss him. I couldn't understand why he didn't want to kiss me???&nbsp; So than the teacher pulled me off of him, and we both got notes sent home from school saying that we had gotten into a fight. We got in trouble for fighting cause I tried to kiss a boy...sigh...haha..."

"event","But it's my journal so I can do whatever the hell I want...

I don't know if i've disliked a woman so much as Jon's mom. This woman puts me on edge more than anyone I know. I hate the way she manipulates her own son.&nbsp; She feels guilty, so she makes Jon feel guilty so she can pass it off on him so she dosen't have to. She says that her 24 year old son is rebelling.&nbsp; One minute, she says he's wasting her money (uh, she dosen't have a job, by the way) by going to school, then she gets pissed cause he's not looking for grad schools.&nbsp; When he does something, like not cut his hair, she runs her mouth, refussing to shut up and listen to Jon at all, and say how she can't believe he's doing this to her...um, psycho.&nbsp; She made Jon feel bad that his dad is in the hospital, so that Jon would come home and do all of her yard work, even though he's trying to be a man and go to work and school.&nbsp; She's so fucking manipulative.

Now, I feel it starting on me.&nbsp; I feel like she's trying to manipulate me too. I already feel alot of hostilatiy toward her.&nbsp; I'm not Brandy Coldwell, so she dosen't like me. She dosen't want me to marry Jon, she thinks I'm drity and would be a bad wife to him, and has said ""i don't think she's right for you, and I don't think she's good for you""....ouch.&nbsp; 

This might be a little thing, but my ""woman's intuition"" is kicking in big time on this one, and I don't know why.&nbsp; Stepping back, this is complety silly, I know, but I have a horrible feeling about this.&nbsp; So, Jon has a flat tire and a huge crack in his windsheild, so he took it to his dad's shop to get it fixed, and it's not fixed yet, so he has to take my car to do all the things his mom says for him to do.&nbsp; So, Jon has to go up to Easly tonight, on my poor little car that has to get me through grad school, because his mom wants him to take care of her dog.&nbsp; I'm not invited.

We aren't married yet. Yes, when we get married, mine will be his and his will be mine, but we are NOT married yet, so that doesn't apply.&nbsp; Nothing in this world&nbsp; would make me happier than marrying Jon, nothing at all, but things could happen and we might never get married.&nbsp; He might end up in another part of the world in a few months, things could happen, and it might not work out.&nbsp; We aren't married, so I don't use his resorces, my parents don't expect me to go into his bank account when I'm broke, his parents shouldn't think he can take my car like it's his to their house whenever he damn well pleases to do favors for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; She hates me, dosent want me to marry her son, but thinks its ok for him to use my stuff when it's convenient for her.&nbsp; It just really pisses me off, and I know it's ""not a big deal"", but it freaks me out and I don't know why.

The kicker is that Jon wants me to go with him, he wants me to ""be by his side"", and I would, if I didn't have to be around anyone&nbsp; who thinks that I'm a bad preson for her son. It kills me not being their for him, but he dosne't need my bagage, and my attitude right now, he dosen't deserve it, so I'm trying to spare him of it.&nbsp; I'm not going to spend my time impressing a woman that has already decided that she dosen't like me.
Jon has said that my mom is a better mother to him than his own mom. 


""A man will leave his mother and father and build a new home with his wife"".&nbsp; She's not my mom, I don't have to love her, and I deffinatly don't have to do her any favors, so like hell if I will."

What's the most fun you can have for as little cash as possible? What truley is the ""happiest place on earth""?

"event","So, I have this ""rash"", and I use this word lightly becasue the nurses and Dr.s don't know what it is. They've brought in 3 dr.s to look at me.&nbsp; They just said they'd have to take a wild guess and give me some steroids and to come back. Well, the steroids aren't helping because new spots keep poping up and the ones I have are getting bigger.
The dr.s still don't know what is wrong with my kidneys and why I have kidney stones and why my blood pressure is so high.
They also don't know why I have a headache that starts at 3-4 everyday and won't go away until I go to sleep.
They also don't know why if I sleep 6, 8, or 12 hours, how I'm still always tierd.
They also don't know why I keep gaining so much weight so fast when they really can't find a reason for it.
I'm tierd of doctors and I'm tierd of being sick and I'm tierd of not knowing why.
I just keep trying to tell myself that maybe I don't want to know the answer, I might just be happier that way....
Prayers are welcomed at this point....

"event","Yaok, so I haven't updated my journal in a really long time because, we'll lets put it that I was ashamed.  My last journal was just for me to rant and bitch and then I'd have people read my journal and get tierd of me bitching, so I didn't want to do that any more but it just looks like its just going to have to turn into that anyway...sigh...oh well.

I'm tierd of feeling like I'm a bad person, I'm tierd of NEVER fucking taking up for myself because I am perfectly aware of the reprecutions that would follow, and honestly, I'd rather cry and be mad at myself then telling someone how I feel about a subject and having them be more pissed at me afterwards.  I'll just swallow it all untill it makes me vomit.  It was said that I had/have no backbone.  So, I tried, one time, to have a backbone and stick up for myself and what happened, I was told that I was acting like a four year old. So, I find that speaking my mind is utterly pointless and I am also aware of the fact that I am much prettier when my mouth is shut (dont try to tell me otherwise, because this idea was placed in my head by another person).

I am also FUCKING SICK AND TIERD of being a nice person, a kind, gunuine caring, loving person and getting pissed on at the end.  I try to care, I try to show that I do and I get cussed out and walked out on and treated like shit.  I think I'd rather be ass raped.

I know you don't read this, but if by chance you do...You fucking say you care,  but you don't. If you cared, you'd respect the fact that I am tender hearted, I've had a fucking rough life and I need somee genuine freindship.  Not,""ya, we're still friends.  I love you Rachel, I really do."" and then five minutes later treat me like shit 'cause you've had a bad day.  When I have a bad day, I don't cuss people out and walk out on them.  You used to be a friend, but now that I have this ""ex"" label on me, because I have this title and we fucked, you have the right to treat me like a dog.  No, fuck this, you tell me you care, if you cared, you wouldn't hurt me. And, everytime you treat me like shit, you try to appologize.  Part of an appology is that YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID WRONG AND AGREE TO NEVER TO IT AGAIN!  Ya, sorry I didn't say ""your forgiven"" when you said you were sorry.  Sorry I remained silent and shook my head. But understand that reason why I did that was because I'm tierd of it.  Im tierd of you being cruel and heartless.  Im tierd of you walking out on me when I'm trying to talk to you.  I'm tierd of you saying ""Whatever"" and leaving and then appologizing later, dont appologize cause you dont mean it.  If you meant it you WOULDN'T FUCKING DO IT ANYMORE. I care about you, you asshole, and you shit on me for it."

"event","Alright, so I'm back and better then ever...er...maybe not.  If you kept up with my last journal, you'll understand all the cynacism that comes along with reading my posts.  If not, your in for either a good time or a kick in the teeth, take your pick I suppose. Im back at college.  Starting my sophmore year. Only 8 more years to go! Sorry to all of you out there looking for my old journal, I had to completly delete it about a month ago because I was getting some pretty nasty emails from some anonomys asslicker.  So I'm here to start all over.  I have some of my favorite posts from my old journal saved on my hard drive, so if you have any requests, feel free to email me."

I realize that I'm running.
I'm running from what I think I'm chasing.
Really man, 
I'm moving my legs as fast as they'll crank
crank crank crank 
move me to my destination
but now

oops

i've been c ranking 
in the wrong direction
all this time



i get close enough to feel it
then i freak out
and run pell-mell
in the opposite direction

nothing can save me now

mismatched emotions
i see life dragging out before me
i want to be that creative
i want to search
dive
find
what you did
i want so much
i can't stop wanting
it just keeps on comin
and i'm left
with fragments of a life
that don't really make sense
and you
you certainly don't make sense
and i wonder
wonder
what the hell am i in?

"event","things have been up, then down, and back again.  but sometimes they're just static.  which is confusing. 

anyway- we've done our first creative writing piece (i <3 creative writing!) and we're reading it in front of the class.  i am nervous for many reasons 1. i am not a very good reader out louder.  i get all mixed up and go too far ahead in my mind before my mouth can get there.  2.  my piece may be offensive to the majority of the people in my class and is not funny enough to make up for its offensiveness  3.  i don't really care if people are offended, but yet again, a small part of me does care  4.  there are many holes in my piece that i forsee people tearing apart with their teeth.  i've tried to fix them, but there are just too many.  its the nature of the assignment.  but that does not rest well with me.  

sometimes i think in cliches and i don't like it.  its a very rut-like habit.  unfortuantely, it is often hard to get out of ruts.

"event","frugal is a funny word.  it is on the list of words that i like.  i mean really the idea of it.  not its specific connotation to money.  but the idea of being sparse.  i like that word too.  spartan.  i wonder what it would be like to live like that.  not have very much.  i mean, there is so much shit in my house.  i really don't need that much of it.  and along with that, i associate the crappy processed food taht takes over my house.  i much prefer clementines, but as i discussed yesterday, i can't eat an entire container of clementines by myself.  so, i just have to steal them from rachel.  anyway.
creative writing is actually really awesome.  we haven't even written anything yet.  there are just loads of interesting people in the class and i mean its writing.  economics hwr is not so cool.  mr. straw reminds me of George.  i don't want to spend everyday with George.  a week was hard enough.  i miss the summer.  i miss not having to do the same thing every day.  i miss babysitting (yes i do.  remind me when i'm complaining later) because Nick and Nora are so creative and it was like getting to be a kid again.  not that i completely want to regress to that, i just like getting to do things for the hell of it.  i mean, playing make believe.  having sword fights.  climbing on a giant oversized anchor.  and it always made me feel smart, even tho they're only 9&10, we played games about WWII and such.  it was actually using the things i learned.  instead of just having them pounded into my head.  over and over agian.  i feel counter-productive right now.  static.  not going anywhere.  so much is in motion around me, but i feel like i'm standing still and its just rushing all around me.  i participate and am involved in the rushing, but i just feel so stationary.  nothings going forward for me.  in fact, i feel almost like i'm going backwards.  i haven't gotten a feeling of accomplishment, of true glorified doing something right since the dinghy days.  eveyrhting is always good, but theres always a hole or something wrong.  nothing is pushing me ahead.  


how much can you force ever?  really push for and have it turn out right?  i don't know.  but we'll see



and this has been another adventure into the workings of my brain."

thats kinda what i felt like last night.  actually thats basically exactly what i've felt like almost every night ever.  well, not ever.  but a lot.  i try not to be dissapointed about it, to just accept it, but really it never works.  i just end up ruining the day.  yesterday was an amazing day.  i was wearing my very hot and trendy ""Delmar is Superban"" shirt.  things were good.  then-it was just dissapointment.  because i create stories in my head, ideal situations, and i mean really its hard not to be disapointed after that.  i just can't making the stories.  and i can't even really explain them/ is it normal to make story- like things in your head?  because they're not stories, its more like what i want to happen.  and i convince myself that it might happen, that theres a chance.  i've been doing it for forever.  and i can't stop.  its like an addiction.  rather, it is an addiction.

"event","i am updating because SOMEONE is hounding me to do so.  i don't really have anything to say, as my life is incredibly boring.  i mean, i'm so bored that i make things up to worry about.  or i confuse my self just for the hell of it.  silly things like that.  or i work on expressing different emotions.  like i decided in physics that i'm going to try and be as contrary and stubborn and annoying as possible.  so i try really really really hard.  i even sorta ""spoke harshly"" to someone (who was unfortunately not mowry) today. but then it just fails.  i gave in. i apologized. and then i just sit there and write for the rest of the period.  not cool writing, just seeing if i can fill up a page with words.  or my homework.  sometimes i play the word association game (like i'm doing now) and i love it.  i love seeing where my mind takes me.  sometimes it takes my level of boredom to 0.  and that rocks.  i think people underappreciate their minds.  a lot. i mean, your mind is everything. its what controls you.  and people have found some pretty dumb ways to mess that up, or to just not think about it.  i mean  my mind is proportionally not doing much by thinking this through and forming sentences and all that, but its still doing it a lot.  school is like training you brain i guess. i just came up with that.  i mean, our brains didn't form sentences originally.  we have to train them to do that.  our brains don't instinctively multiply or divide.  we have to show them how to do it.  but really, someone's mind came up with that.  i think now i'm going on the border between....well i guess who someone is is represented by their mind.  or their actions which come from their mind.  huh.

"event","well, there are a lot of things i don't get.  this JL is one of them.  why do i pour myself out to other people? what is the point? does anyone read this?  and if they do read it, why do they care?  i mean, i read peoples JLs and realistically, they sometimes spark a lot of thought (dani) and sometimes i'm amused and sometimes i don't care.  

but molasses heres part of the bonfire:

carmnie: SO CONFUSED
carmnie: but then again
carmnie: i think
carmnie: i'm making myself confused on purpose
carmnie: which then actually adds to the real confusion
carmnie: and then 
carmnie: sometimes i think i'm secretly on crack, and i just don't recognize that because i'm SO DAMN CONFUSED
chantizzle14: all from dani's lj?
carmnie: yes, it was the spark
carmnie: it kinda grew into a bonfire tho
chantizzle14: write it in your lj!
chantizzle14: write the bonfire!
carmnie: i'm writing!
carmnie: lol
carmnie: you want me to put in the acutal bonfire analogy?
chantizzle14: yes.
chantizzle14: a direct quote
chantizzle14: ..from your brain...
chantizzle14: lol



anyway- but see, why did you just read all that?  why are you still reading?  and/or are you still reading?  at the same time- would i have made it through this far in other people's thoughts? or would i have given up, becuase it didn't interest me?  because i think largely of myself?  do i? does everyone?  is that why humans are humans? or is that why Americans are Americans?  or is that just why i'm me?  is there something wrong with me for wondering about that?  

and then thats not even getting into causing my own confusion which i often do.  i mean, as dani stated Daninaz14: its carolanguage
meaning i speak a unique language that I don't even get.  i mean, i need a filter/funnel to understand what i'm thinking.  and even then i don't ususally get it.  

well, i'm gonna leave that where it is now.  and i'm going to leave myself wondering why i wrote this, why you're reading it and who you think i am now.  or who you thought i was in the first place. because maybe it boils down to that and maybe its whether or not we care about what other people think about us.


and now, this has TRUELY developed into one of those emo JLs that some people make fun of. and i still don't get it."

this is an unprecedented (by me) solo adventure into my mind!  i didn't want to have the silly 05 deal, but the other name was taken, so dealing must be done.

well- i am a bit apprehensive about this.  don't get me wrong- i'm more than willing to detail my inner thoughts, but this is so...open.  its just out there in the computere world.  anybody can read what i'm thinking.  or rather, what i type.  that kinda scares me.  i mean, sometimes what i think is kinda nonsense-like.  and since this is my <b> very own </b> , i have no one else to blame the silliness on (hehe jk chantizzle :) ) right-

oh and the other part is- even though i'm putting it out there, theres no guarentee.  i'm not good with that.  i like knowing.  i like statistics.  this, its like spilling my guts, but allowing everyone to pick through them and then judge me based on what i happened to say.  even if its subconcious, that judging is there. and thats what scares me.

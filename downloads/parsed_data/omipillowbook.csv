"event","I thought I was going to ask Ernie to marry me in Tokyo, but I'm no longer as spontaneous as I once was. I don't particularly mind not having his ring on my finger; I think I've snared him fairly well without it. :) We had a few strange conversations, and I'm still sorting out some of the things I said. Sometimes I wonder at my forgetfulness, my tunnel vision, when it comes to my loved ones. Ernie's not an honest man, and I know that. But on a deeper level, an emotional one, he's the truest one I know. His heart's all leopardskin and jewels -isn't that how I described it?- and there's nothing hidden under them.

I also spoke to Professor Matsushita about my <i>Genji</i> work, and she has offered to collaborate with me. I am not sure how I feel about this opportunity. It would feel good to give over what I've done to her -she's assured me of collaborator credit, either way- but I'm attached to my choices, even if some of them were wrong. I suppose now is the time to decide whether this is a vanity project or a real endeavor. If I stopped now, I'd have to find something else to work on with my spare time, my time that I set aside for real thinking. Working on this translation challenges me in a way that nothing else does. If I were to work on it seriously, or finish it, it might lose its fun. I shouldn't have written her back. 



I've missed my Chinatsu so much. I've got her room all ready, and I can't wait to hear her news. She was so tall, over Christmas break! It's as if she's trying to match the British children...she'll tower over me, I'm sure. I wonder if she'll have an accent now? Being all alone here has made me feel like Japanese is my own private language, or a private voice for the two of us. Going back to Tokyo was almost like going back into a dream."

"event","This is IceToad-- first name Ice, surname Toad. He is a taciturn, brooding, facially tattooed man who enjoys suffering, hurting people, and standing in the rain. Ice's primary weapon is the pie gun. His parents, bakers both, taught him to make the finest pies in MagiBattleVille; unfortunately the young Ice was ridiculed by the youthful peers who didn't understand his passion for pastry. This eventually drove him to a life of crime, first robbery, then murder. Always he would leave pie at the scene, partly as a calling card, but mostly to assuage his guilt with the good feeling of feeding a hungry policeman. 

One fateful night, Ice was fleeing the Aurors through a church when he was unexpectedly given sanctuary by the kindly priest. The two became close friends, and Ice experienced, if not a conversion, at least an epiphany. One morning, after a long stay at the church, he mounted his Nimbus 2000 and rode away without a glance back at his benefactor. He was, once more, ready for action. This time, however, Ice had a better cause: he would distribute his fine pies, not to compensate for his evil, but solely to do good.

Unfortunately the world into which Ice stepped was full of people beating the hell out of each other, and after one or two sound drubbings, he fled back into the arms of violence. What can I say? Easy come, easy go."

"event","I am walking through Shibuya after dark. Everything is strangely blurry; it looks almost pixellated, and it is all in black and white. People walk by slowly. They are white and blurred and their feet are not properly touching the ground.

I am trying to go to the store for a bottle of water, but I'm wearing a big, heavy rucksack which is hung all over with metal scourges. Every time I take a step, the scourges bump and bite into my arms and legs. I remove the pack, although the scourges turn into little suckers and they put up a tremendous fight. I walk warily backwards, holding my wand, because the pack is starting to regain its strength and it is beginning to walk on the suckers as if they were insect legs. I can move much faster, though, and I run to the store.

When I get there, I find that it is closed, and the pixellated doors tingle and burn when I touch them. I blast them open with my wand and they singe like paper. Inside everything is halftone and still, the shoppers frozen in attitutes of everyday life. As I get further into the store, it looks less halftone and more charred, and puffs of charcoal are stirred up by my feet and cling to my unshaven legs. The water is at the very back and the bottles are all melted. I have to push aside a blackened, skeletal little hand to get at the best-preserved one.

Then I am wandering through the store, trying to find the exit again. I take a wrong turn and then I'm in an orchard, a grove of orange trees. I take a deep breath, but it's silent and they don't smell of anything."

"event","<b>Eleanor</b>, 6. Sweet but demanding, spoiled in that way that some little girls can be-- automatically, even if raised in an orphanage. Talkative. Overeducated, and probably the kind of juvenile mythologist who doesn't know reality from fiction. Very familiar, of course, because I was once a bright child too. And so was Ernie, in his way. I see only a little of him in her, but it's enough.

<b>Roland</b> (Rollie), 10. Quiet and clever. The more immediately likable of the two, though this is entirely a function of their ages. Interested in insects, and will probably cry if he isn't sorted into Hufflepuff. Fortunately, this seems quite unlikely. He was extremely nice to Chinatsu, and doesn't seem to think much of himself. Is that from his father...? I don't tend to date self-confident men, but Ernie is the eternal exception. No. Ernie knows himself well, after all. But he might once have been like either of them.

I want to meet their mother. I will in passing, if at all. I want to know what kind of parent she is. She seems to encourage their passions, and she certainly dresses them well (if Ernie didn't have them in the morning, anyway) but I have never gotten a very good idea from him of what she's like. It's not his fault. I just don't ask enough."

And tonight we're all having dinner at my house, so I have to pick up the crabmeat...I'm making sushi! Well, rolls, anyway. And nothing scarier than smoked salmon. I can't guarantee our survival if I take a greater risk.

I'm not doing anything today except cook, clean and buy clothes. My day couldn't get any more female unless I was actually giving birth. Fortunately, that is not on the schedule; I would have had to pencil it into lunchtime, and if it took more than two hours we wouldn't have time to do the laundry or alter anything.

...Chinatsu, wake <i>up</i>. I don't have any library books left, and there's no day-trading on Easter weekend. Nobody's online, either, which makes sense at 8:43 a.m. on a weekend. But we both went to bed early. I know we did. Her light was off.

I hope that everyone has a good Easter tomorrow. We don't have any particular plans, though I think that Chinatsu is going to a friend's for part of the day. 

Sometimes I forget that she's only fifteen, and sometimes I'm surprised that she's as old as fifteen. Is that just what happens with children? Or is age relative with everyone? Sometimes I feel much younger than I used to. Lighter, and less polished, and more funny, and gladder to be alive-- not that I was ever any of those things when I was younger. But I still remind myself of the way I was then, or the way I tried to act. Isn't that odd? I was pretending to be just what I am.

Anyway, the days fill up just as they used to. I work more, and translate less, but I'm still doing the latter, every evening for an hour. I'm going through in order, now. I haven't thrown out my old drafts, but I can see flaws in their language; I've always had to work hard to understand the difference between English and Japanese speech patterns, and when I reread my old work I find that I'm not using either properly. Either they sound like English people or they sound like an eighteenth-century English speaker trying to explain how the Japanese talk. It all seems a much more daunting task than it once did. And much more of a <I>task</i>, much more the setting down of words on paper, with the implied duty of honesty to them. 

Then again, so many people are dishonest and fine. Junko gave me a copy of <i>The Tale of Murasaki</i> last week; it's all nonsense. We don't know enough about Murasaki to write a biography, much less a novel. But there is a good chapter in which she meets Shonagon, who is written <i>just</i> how I imagined her to be, and when I was reading it I <i>wanted</i> it to be true. In a way, I suspect fictionalization is the highest form of flattery. I don't think I would mind being written into a novel, myself, even if far less than a thousand years had gone by. It's the same with all of the books and movies and plays that have used elements from <i>Genji</i> over the years. A text evolves and is misused, and that's how we know that it is good. Maybe the ideal translation is highly edited, heavily rewritten and adapted to the speech patterns of its audience. Maybe pastiches should be read as part of the original. Maybe the authors of <i>Bridget Jones' Diary</i> and <i>The Redoubtable Thomas</i> should get more credit. But if that's the case, this isn't the task for me. I don't know how I would change this book, if I had the chance. I just know how it goes.

Banana Yoshimoto wrote a novella (does she ever write anything else?) called <i>NP</i>. It was about a short story whose would-be translators all killed themselves, and incest. I should reread that.

Here is Chinatsu! And she's wearing her crown!"

For Junko:
134
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,
But I could never sell - 
If you would like to <i>borrow</i>
Until the Daffodil

Unties her yellow Bonnet
Beneath the village door,
Until the Bees, from Clover rows
Their hock, and Sherry, draw,

Why, I will lend until just then,
But not an hour more!

For Marcus:
135
Water, is taught by thirst.
Land - by the Oceans passed.
Transport - by throe -
Peace - by its battles told - 
Love, by Memorial Mold -
Birds, by the Snow.

For Parvati:
1647
Of Glory not a Beam is left
But her Eternal House-
The Asterisk is for the Dead,
The Living, for the Stars-

For Gilderoy: 
479
She dealt her pretty words like Blades - 
How glittering they shone - 
And every One unbared a Nerve
Or wantoned with a Bone -

She never deemed - she hurt -
That - is not Steel's Affair - 
A vulgar grimace in the Flesh - 
How ill the Creatures bear -

To ache is human - not polite - 
The film upon the eye 
Mortality's old Custom - 
Just locking up - to Die.

For Lynn:
352
Perhaps I asked too large - 
I take - no less than skies - 
For Barths, grow this as
Berries, in my native town - 

My Backet holds - just - Firmaments -
Those - dangle easy - on my arm,
But smaller bundles - Cram.

For Ernest!:
1311
This dirty - little - Heart
Is freely mine.
I won it with a Bun - 
A Freckled shrine -

But eligably fair
To him who sees
The Visage of the Soul
And not the knees.

For Vincente and his friend:
435
Much Madness is divinest Sense -
To a discerning Eye -
Much Sense - the starkest Madness -
'Tis the Majority
In this, as all, prevail -
Assent - and you are sane -
Demur - you're straightaway dangerous - 
And handled with a Chain -

I just liked this one.
861
Split the Lark - and you'll find the Music - 
Bulb after Bulb, in Silver rolled -
Scantily dealt to the Summer Morning
Saved for your ear when Lutes be old.

Loose the Flood - you shall find it patent -
Gush after Gush, reserved for you -
Scarlet Experiment! Sceptic Thomas!
Now do you doubt that your Bird was true?"

<lj-cut text = ""When Britain first at Heav'n's command..."">

STANZA 1:
When Britain first at Heav'n's command, Arose from out the azure main;
This was the charter of the land, And guardian angels sang this strain;

CHORUS:
Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves; Britons never shall be slaves.

STANZA 2:
The nations not so blest as thee, Shall in their turns to tyrants fall;
While thou shalt flourish great and free, The dread and envy of them all.

CHORUS:
Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves; Britons never shall be slaves.

STANZA 3:
Still mor majestic shalt thou rise, More dreadful from each foreign stroke;
As the loud blast that tears the skies, Serves but to root thy native oak.

CHORUS:
Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves; Britons never shall be slaves.

STANZA 4:
Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame, All their attempts to bend thee down;
Will but arouse thy generous flame, But work their woe, and thy renown.

CHORUS:
Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves; Britons never shall be slaves.

STANZA 5:
To thee belongs the rural reign, They cities shall with commerce shine;
All thine shall be the subject main, And every shore it circles thine.

CHORUS:
Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves; Britons never shall be slaves.

STANZA 6:
The Muses, still with freedom found, Shall to thy happy coast repair;
Blest Isle! With matchless beauty crowned, And manly hearts to guide the fair.

CHORUS:
Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves; Britons never shall be slaves.

</lj-cut>

The Japanese National Anthem is hardly less bombastic, though I believe it is the only national anthem written in <i>tanka</i> form (five lines, thirty-one syllables). It is also concise.

<lj-cut text = ""Kimi ga yo wa..."">
Kimi ga yo wa
Chiyo ni yachiyo ni
Sazare ishi no
Iwao to nari te 
Koke no musu made. 
(Repeat.)

May the reign of the Emperor continue for a thousand- nay- eight thousand generations; 
May it last for eternity, for the time it takes for a small pebble to grow into a great and moss-covered stone.

</lj-cut>

I think that I approve of the Bulgarian anthem, because it contains a rare trait: concrete justification. ""Why is this country worth my attention?"" everyone asks at the start of an anthem. And the Bulgarian people answer: ""The Danube. Now you know where it is"".

<lj-cut text = ""Gorda Stara Planina..."">

Gorda Stara Planina,
Do nej Dunava sinej,
Sluntse Tkrakija ogr'ava,
Nad Pirina plamenej

CHORUS:
Milo Rodino,
Ti si zemen raj,
Tvojta khubost, tvojta prelest,
Akh te n'amat kraj

Padnakha bojtsi bezchet,
Za naroda nash l'ubim,
Majko, daj mi muzhka sila,
Put'a im da prodolzhim

CHORUS 

---
ENGLISH TRANSLATION
 
Proudly rise the Balkan peaks,
At their feet Blue Danube flows;
Over Thrace the sun is shining,
Pirin looms in purple glow. 

CHORUS:
Oh, dear native land,
Earthly paradise!
For your loveliness, your beauty
E'er will charm our eyes.

Uncounted fighters died
for our beloved people
Mother, give me the strength
Their path to continue.

The American one is just as starry-eyed as I expected. 9.9 I've always liked the tune, though.
You don't sing <i>all</i> of the verses, do you?

<lj-cut text = ""Oh, say, can you see?"">

Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight'
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming.
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 

On the shore dimly seen, thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream;
'Tis the star-spangled banner: oh, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Oh, thus be it ever when free men shall stand,
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Power that has made and preserved us as a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust"";
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."

"event","One of them is small and hard, like a stone. It isn't impossible to penetrate, but one must posses a diamond. This is not a rough stone, but a carefully set and polished one; its bearer has obviously worked hard at keeping it looking like a candy, even though it sits on the dresser, largely forgotten otherwise.

One of them is big but strangely dry. It is still working, but it is leathery inside, like a seed or a nut which still rattles when shaken. It does not pull you in, but you can climb to the center without incident.

One of them is large but porous-- not unlike a jungle inside. The closer you get to the center, the more it pulls you towards your given place. Not everyone finds themselves in it immediately; most find themselves in it by accident. 

Yet another is blue and labyrinthine. You may enter it easily, but you may not leave without picking something up and putting something down. It is squelchier than the previous, and moves you through it with similar speed, but sometimes places you in another compartment rather than keeping you in the same.

Another is pale orange, and lined with all sorts of strange items-- green shag carpering, tiger fur, dark wood panelling, sandstone, stars. It can't be entered in company with another person. This heart is hung inside with pictures, like a museum, although there is no scuplture in the middle of the rooms. There are benches. You may stay as long as you like without paying admission.

The last one is smooth and cold, an underground cave made of rose quartz where children run and play on the floor. The children are allowed to play with chalk, but adults coming in are handed hoses and squirt guns instead. There is an amphitheater at the center, in which comedies and tragedies are constantly played out."

I have not been at the computer very much lately, as I've been doing my translation work in longhand; besides, the rest of you seem so very busy that I rarely see you on AIM anymore. I have been a bit busier than usual myself, with Chinatsu's term starting; her European history course is very difficult and we have been unable to find her a tutor yet. She seems to have plenty of friends, but perhaps none is the type to excel in history.

Hopefully, I'll make another day trip to England soon. I want to visit Junko now that she's a proper partner, and I may be seeing a man (I'm writing him, anyway) in one of the southern cities. :) I don't know him well yet, but he's intelligent and chivalrous, and keeps an opossum as a pet.

He has a moral lesson which I get one guy had more stripy tights, together with various interesting tights, together with various interesting tights.""

In addition: my interest has been successfully caught by the PanAsian Cup, due in part to a surprising new line-up for Japan. Imagine- I haven't personally played with any of the Chasers! And their new Seeker is not young Anda, for which I am thankful; instead it's someone named Ninomiya Herenu. I think that the intention was ""Helen Ninomiya""? What a lucky girl.

"event","I narrowly avoided growing up on the Beatles-- the first music I learned well was by a band called Lady Bird, a wizarding group from Hokkaido who tried for the same visual and musical style as the middle-period Beatles. When I got to school and was introduced to the original, I resented learning that my beloved group was derivative. Eventually I stopped resisting, and before I knew it taste was born.

Today I picked up Lady Bird's first record and ""Rubber Soul"" and played them one after another. It was harder to tell my opinions apart than I thought it would be. Lady Bird stole ideas, but they embroidered on them and sent them back on their way. Sometimes the result anticipated where the Beatles were going to go in a few years. It's too bad that all influence can't work that well.

The boys made him sound as if he permits himself only that among the selfish things of the world. I don't very much like really unselfish people, even when they're not self-righteous about it. Everybody needs to help themselves, or they won't be able to do a thing for each other. You can take it too far, as Viktor's done many times, but it's easier to forgive taking selfishness too far than selflessness. The Krums of the world find it easier to regret their excesses and learn to use their tendencies. The Flints of the world believe that they're doing someone a favor by concentrating obsessively upon doing the least for themselves and the most for others. I've known some saints who could take it, but Flint is no such thing.

At least now the three of us are talking, and we even had a friendly, pointless conversation yesterday!

I've lost patience with trying to second-guess Murasaki-sensei; I'm staying with my most recent conclusion, that she did it to maintain the novel's atmosphere of gossip or furtive storytelling, the conceit of an attendant whispering to her lady about other court figures whose names she'd already know, with the secondary intention of showing characters' rising and falling status. Well, there are other ways to make that apparent. A thousand years' worth of audiences have spoken: the characters need names for this nightmarishly huge book to make sense, and they have accordingly given them some. 

I'm thinking of doing the Akashi/Akikonomu thread next, after I finish doing the Yugao short story. It's a large and significant section, and contains the best poetry in the book, and it will be hard going. Even so, I have enough interest in the Akashi character to make me think that she is the best inroad into the main plots. This is a recent development. I'd never even really noticed her before, but now that I start to mark off the various plots, whole new sides have begun to emerge. She's intelligent and composed, an excellent poet, and she knows herself better than any other character (except Kashiwagi, who just carries it too far). She sees right through Genji, yet she's been known to worry about her own status, and have her various insecurities as well. I'd like to know her. I'll settle for interpreting her."

"event","It's taken me years and years to realize that I like to fly. I never made much of it in my successful years; it was a source of some embarrassment, in fact, that I had that particular talent. Couldn't I have been a singer, or an actress, or <i>something</i> that involved less greasing-back of my ponytail and watering the pitch with my sweat? This was <i>not</i> what I was raised for. And so I did everything that I could to disassociate myself from Quidditch without leaving altogether, and in the process became responsible for elevating the cult of Seekers from unfortunate to ridiculous levels. Partially responsible, anyway. 

Nevertheless, I like to fly. Once it has been seperated from all of my ridiculous old leather family baggage, it's quite an exhilarating feeling. The feeling of kicking Viktor's ass after all these years is also exhilarating, in case you were curious. It's something like realizing, after searching for umpteen months, that you've owned that Lareine record all along and that it is mint, first pressing, and autographed. By someone who will last longer than Lareine."

Remarkable as a type, smaller and somewhat flawed as a person, but very attractive-- lonely, largely dodges silliness of obsession, very nearly (Tenchou no) Yugao perfected. Not as broken as Viktor thinks she is, or else better at hiding it with strangers, although she is no longer quite used to dealing with strangers. She seems not quite a kindred spirit, but not quite a dark mirror either. I can entirely see why Viktor fell in with her, and hope that she hasn't entirely lost interest in me (although also that we won't speak often).

Lavender Czako: They can pronounce each other's surnames, and so are obviously perfect together. I'm impressed by her Tarot reading and confounded by her plurality of accents; she knows all of the tricks but seems sincere beneath them (I can't quite go so far as ""is"" yet, but it is easier to trust Viktor's judgement with her than with Flint; her journal and the tone of her reading made me think that she has a smooth manner rather than a slippery nature). She seems very different in reality and online-- somewhat more naive and easily pleased in writing, although I don't think she has been naive for a long time. A woman full of contradictions, and difficult to understand. I'll have to ask more about her.

It's very strange to come back to Japan after a relatively long visit. Explanations suddenly fall into place for why I'm not hungry, and why I'm so inexplicably tired.

But this visit didn't have the dreamlike feeling that has always made this readjustment needless before. Instead of a solitary and emotionally high-pitched scene, it was four hours in a flower shop. It did have its surreal side -my company for most of the trip was Viktor and Fujimoto Junko Eidinger, both of whom are unrecognizable yet decent- but it was more real than my previous experiences.

The discovery that I still enjoy real experiences has been a surprise, and it wasn't a pleasant one, at first.

Mr. Lockhart, I'm only sorry that I couldn't see you. Without meaning offense to your two employees, you were really the point of the visit. I hope that your car trouble wasn't anything important?

Unfortunately for my peace of mind, Mr. Lockhart is a clever and perceptive man who's nice enough to get away with the tough questions. If he weren't gay and taken -and if I were able to be really comfortable with someone who talks more than Viktor does- it would make a lot more sense to cut out the middleman and fall for him instead. 

It must be true what they say about men over thirty: gay, taken, or both. Viktor is neither, but perhaps Gilderoy makes up for that in the cosmic balance?

-I <i>still</i> can't think of him as Gilderoy. It sounds so overdone. That's the judgement of instinct, of course, but it's so hard to transliterate properly and you don't want ""giru"" in your name in any case. At least Viktor has better associations.

I should call. I wish I had a less immediate way to communicate, but nobody sends poems by messenger these days.

Really, Viktor's just being what he always is. He doesn't think of you if you're not in his immediate sight. It would be nice if I could reconsider given that, but I can't. I'll never find another man who's managed to burn out so well, or whose problems connect so elegantly with mine. And I'm certainly never going to find another one who worries so much about the people he loves."

"event","I found the the last <i>Seirei Reiko</i> collection today, so I went ahead and found out how it ended. There are only so many ways to finish the story of a vengeful ghost and her tormentor's descendants, so I assumed it would be tragic- but I was <i>not</i> expecting the end of the world. I suppose that if you're going to kill every character the readers care about, you might as well go the rest of the way.

I assumed that I would be disappointed by the ending -every story you abandon seems smaller when you return- but either Kaminaga has become a truly brilliant writer, or my expectations were too low, or both. Probably the latter. I don't blame myself; stories, as I said, do shrink, and the shopkeeper talked about <I>Reiko</i> in very nostalgic tones. ""Will this someday be milked for nostalgia?"" is a good question to ask of anything when you want to know if it will last. Although since the ending was good, I can only conclude that he was fooled by the faux-seventies art style. If I'd been paying attention, I probably could have objected to the description of a story dating from 1992-96 as ""old"" and then learned the truth. But at this point, I have the book and don't care any longer.

From excessive Genji and Chinatsu to none at all! Ah, well. Next time."

"event","Being back in the city is a lot like coming to the surface after being underwater for a long time. Down there, you'll find all sorts of interesting coral and fish; up here, there's mostly pollution and noise. But sometimes pollution can be pretty. It certainly lends things atmosphere.

I went to Shibuya today. I've walked over a few times while Chinatsu is at school. And I'd forgotten how optimistic everyone there is- even the people whose subcultures forbid it, even the people who are just there to show off their fashions. The feeling is overwhelming that ""it's worth coming to Shibuya today to see what's new in the world"".

I like to watch it. Maybe tomorrow I'll work in one of the cafes (if you can read a thousand-year-old novel in that kind of place, and I'm not sure whether you can). It's a little lonely in the apartment, completely different from the way it was in the house. Everything hums.

And now, a person who knows his name: would you like me to come over again tonight-tomorrow? I'm still worried about you, and we didn't really talk..."

"event","I'm writing this from the main room, since we've just moved the computer out of Chichan's- it looks like she'll be with me for at least a little longer, as she's not going back to Koguma for the spring-summer term after all. The reason: we are moving to the city. (I can't believe it, either.)

Apparently Chichan (after a brief waiting-list scare, the reason she was upset earlier in the week) is now in at the school she wanted to attend. The trouble is that it's not a boarding school, and even with Floo the commute is long, so we've decided that the sensible thing to do is to get an apartment in Tokyo and stay there most of the time. (This is what we're telling each other, anyway- really it's that she desperately wants to go to Tokyo, my agreement is against both my own desires and my assumptions about her future, and everyone is trying to cover up these respective facts.)

I've been talking on the phone all day. It looks like there might be a two-bedroom place in Daikanyama available. That sounds promising to me. I seem to remember it being on the outer edges of what I used to consider the interesting part of the city, and Chichan is very optimistic about that. I don't know why, since ""a normal life"" was most of her argument for public school, and it's not as if this place is very normal.

Of course, she could also have meant ""a Muggle life"" or ""a consistent life"". She can't really explain what she wants to become in the next few years, and this is worrying. Yet I firmly believe in ending unhappy situations, even when you lack plans for the future. My intuition has never led me to someplace I disliked.

Of course, this time we're following hers."

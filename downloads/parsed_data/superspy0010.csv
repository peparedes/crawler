"event","Ellen broke up with me.

I don't get it. I didn't act like an ass. 

I just really feel bad about the fact that now I won't be able to spend my time with someone that cares about me in that way. I love my friends and all, but friends can't make out with you and be your girlfriend. 

It's hurts because I thought she cared about me and that obviously is not the case if she does not want to be with me. She told me that she was ""going through stuff"" and that it wouldn't be fair to be in a relationship while that was going on. I thought we were going to be together for a long time, so I guess I kind of ""buckled down"" for the long haul. I thought it was going to be easy because I thought that she liked me and that I liked her. In fact, I did like her and I still do, but it just makes me feel like crap because she doesen't like me, or maybe she does and really does feel that she shouldn't be with me because of her stuff. 

She was at first going to blow me off completly on our date. She was going to go with Francis to her house and help her study.

My reason for wanting a girlfriend is fueled 10-15 percent by the sexual aspect of it and the rest is the fact that if I do find an awesome girlfriend, we would be able to be happy together and be there for each other. 

On friday, when I rode the brown line home I pretty much cried all the way to Paulina. I spent the whole day after school with Holly Jaffey and Kaitlyn (sp?) and that was pretty cool. It kept my mind off of Ellen and I got to see Holly. Holly talked to me and made me feel all-round better. Kaitlyn was there and as it is known, she has been going out with Jesse Hoyt for some time, I think. To me, that was kind of like fate shoving it in my face that to people could be happy and I myself coulnd't find that. It wasn't like she was literally doing it, it was just that I knew she had a long-term relationship going and I didn't. I wasn't jealous or anything either, It was just that I noticed that fact and it didn't help things.

I talked to Jon Bruckman and he had his say on things. He was cool and was just like ""don't worry about it man.""

The worst part is, Ben told me that this was going to happen and I dismissed it completly.

I just want to find someone I can be with.

Why is it so hard?"

"event","Ellen like, tottally likes me. It's so obvious and I thinks I made it pretty obvious to her that I like her. This actaully would work and I think that's cool. 

The best part? She came to me about it.

Sweet.

I was told by some very wise people that I should wait for one that came to me about their feelings. I think that anyone that does that not only truthfully likes you, but is very brave at the same time. It takes all my will power and courage to talk to girl so I imagine it's much the same way for gals too. 

Man, finally, one girl likes me who is not a child molester or a child eater.

Today I told Mr. Griseto that I would eat him if I had to because we were talking about survival training. He said that some people get crazy if left in a wildlife survival and he pointed at me, he said his bunch of stuff and then I told him; ""You think I wouldn't eat you Mr. Griseto?, I'll do it while you're sleeping!""

He laughed at first, but then I took it to that weird level. Then it wasn't funny. Same old me. Same old dumb habit.

Man, Ellen is pretty cool. She keeps talking to me online. And shes really.....cool.

I want to spend time with more of my friends that rock. This list includes, but is not limited too: Amy Kraft, Courtney Richardson, Holly Jaffey, Rogelio Zamudio, Geoff Henao and pretty much anybody else I have not seen in a while. I haven't even seen Aquasynth in real life, so him too I guess. 

Online people I see are cool. They need to wear Yu-Gi-Oh pins, because they just satrted making those. I want a cool Ninja Yu-Gi-Oh pin, if they even make one. Just to show some people how badassed I am. The only Ninja Yu-GI-Oh monsters are Anatsu and Armed Ninja. One of those better be a pin and ima getting it.

I don't think I hate Samuari's as much as I used to. Thay could be badassed too, just not as much as Ninjas.

said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human

Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a

hell?"" The little girl replied, ""Then you ask him"".

"event","Man, Geoff is too much fun. Geoff, Chris and I all had an awesome time.

We planned the endavor so that I met Mr. Peditto at the Belmont stop on the brown/red line. I bought a muffin for each of us at Su Vans and it was cool. I waited for Mr. Peditto at the stop for like, 6 trains. That took forever. Boring to boot.

I met him after these 6 El trains and then we got on the brown line. We got off at our stop and then proceeded to Mr. Henao's (sp?) house. We got there and it was pretty neat. I sang songs and marched all the way there. Chris was like ""ya fool!"".

We got in and it was funny. Then it was like, more funny. I don't know. I had an awesome time. I was like so relieved to not be at my own house. All alone. I wasn't prepared to have to spend all day alone in my own house, thinking of Debbie and me. 

I got to have fun and see funny web comics. It was so great. Man, I really love my friends. They are like the Heal Spell you will find in any Final Fantasy game. EXCEPT instead of being a normal Heal-1 or crappy Heal-3, they are like a Heal All + a billion. I could lose both my legs and arms, and if my friends were there, I would still be happy. 

I left Geoff's house and stuff and it was cool. Mr. Peditto and I were super funny on the way to the brown line. I did the Nazi Skip. It was like the Nazi March but....skipping. You had to see it, it was hilarious. THEN we both obliterated this apple. I kicked it with all my might and it flew maybe 3 feet....very.....slowly.

I had enough of that but I got an idea after it was kicked into the street. I lined it up with this ladys car tires and then Mr. Peditto and I both finished crossing the street. We then watched this ladys car and the apple. OMFG. It was so funny. I saw it as a Ninja move. It was like the car had already finished crushing it. There looked to be a few second delay and then BOOM! It was all over in a rain of Apple Insides and seeds. There was this big chunk that didn't die, but it was going to. I know this. 

On a side note, I made fun of Akido. The Martial Art. I hope none of you know it or else I'm going to feel stupid/beat up after you find me.

I played THPS 4 and after 45 minutes of idocracy, I have come to the conclusion that I suck Tony Hawks balls. I have NO IDEA how to work this game that I have been lent. What is an Ollie? And what does Tony Hawk do with it?

My created charater is Greg Badass. Look for him.....WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING!

I am so happy I got to see my friends today.

Before I end this, I want to thank Sean Hastings. That Moo & Oink hat is the best. Plus, you rock. I dunno, thats it for now I suppose.

I wanted to see Fuzz today and get some fun done but instead I wasted cash on Yu-Gi-Oh cards. I really don't want to waste any more cash on the god damned cards because I know it's just a fad and it will die down soon. No one will like it and that will be that. I'll have wasted cash on a piece of crap that no one cares about. Arg, desicions.

I went to Galaxy with Dale, Patrick and Gabe. Well, me and my dad dropped them off and went to pick up tickets at the Bottom Lounge and the the Double Door. I never have been to the Double Door so that was cool. It has a nice setup but the Bottom Lounge kicks its ass.

After this I went to Galaxy. Galaxy is pretty much a trading card shop for weirdos. I bought a Messenger Of Peace and Bazoo The Soul Eater. Both are pretty cool to look at. 

Waste of money.

I went to the suburbs later today with Dale and it was a waste. There was nothing going on and all I did was duel Dale in Yu-Gi-Oh and kick his ass. I later kicked Patricks ass but its really late and I have to go to bed. I'll continue this later.

Oh well. It was good times. What happened was as follows:

I came home from school. I called Gabe and Dale. Dale came over and we waited for Gabe. A liitle later Gabe came over and it was cool. We decided to head out to Su Vans and we did. We got to Su Vans and I intoduced Fuzz and Colin to Gabe. They knew Dale existed from before so there was nothing new there.

We got food and then Fuzz later told asked if anyone would run a quick trip with him. We ran like a full block and it turns out Fuzz can run at mach-speeds. I could keep up with him but then he jumped over this huge pylon thing. It was awesome. It was a GINORMOUS pylon. He hopped over it like nothing. Keep in mind, that he was in his halloween costume, A tennis player. He was dressed in short-shorts and a tight T-shirt. It was kinda gross, but funny also because him and Colin both had fake mustaches on. They looked british. lol.

Fuzz found it so cool that I value/love my friends so much. He called me an awesome person and that made my day alone.

After this, Gabe, Dale and I all went trick-or-treating. We met some old friends while getting candy. They were dubassed whores now, but it was cool for novelty value to see them. When I think about it, they were not friends, so much as people we went to class in grade school with.

I really wanted to see some of you guys for halloween but I guess theres always next time.

I got so much candy.

Why?

He was annoying.

Take yourself off as being a ""friend"" of mine. I dont know you. You dont know me. You were cool last year, maybe. You changed into a jerk who I cant stand. A jerk that also hugs my friends and thinks ""the ladies like"". No one likes you. Not as of now.

You need to stop being a shallow, annoying, egotistical person. People that are liked are deep, caring individuals. You are not this. Take a look at the big picture and sort yourself out. You can be peoples friends, just be a good one.

If you decide to be a real person, you can be a friend of mine. Until then, keep away and dont talk in my prescence. We might have had good times but now youre a goddamn loser. You try too hard to impress fools.

I laughed myself to crying in ALAS. We had to come up with something to tell others about poor children in other countries. My GENIUS idea was to cut pieces of meat up and attach a small piece of ragged cloth on them. We could then tell people that this was 'little bobby' who cut himself into pieces and sold them for money because he was so poor. At the time this was very funnny. Mr. G was like ""someone is having a good time"". All the girls thought I was crying because of the mentioning of poor people without shoes. I got brownie points for this.

Today at school was pretty sweet. I got to make Mr. Peditto, Ms. Bruckman and Holly all laugh today. That made my day. 

I talked to Dr. Fraynd and I told him he was pretty cool. He was like ""Thank you, Riordan. I too, think you are 'keen'."" 

I made Allison laugh in Sch Trig. That was rewarding as well. 

I went to the Alley for Allison and I ran an errand for her. I went with a freshman that goes by the name of Rebecca Brown. She was pretty nice and we talked about some stuff. 

I got to go to Su Vans and hang with Ashley and Colin. That was neat. Those guys are pretty cool and I can make a conversation with them. Colin told me about bases and where I could get classes for it. I got info on good, cheap bases too. Sweet.

Im home now but I didnt get to halep clean up in Su Vans. My dad picked me up. Damn. That sucks.

Music is good and I thought about something.

Nicole is a good person. She loves her friends and I think that rocks. I love my friends too, but I guess im not as open as she is with it. Nicole is the type of person I respect. She knows why and you know why.

my dad is going to jewel. I'll tell him to get me gummy snacks. Those are boss.

Sean, I always got a free line for you. You and Nicole should make a club for good people. You both would be in it."

Today was boring. Sarah (Debbies best friend) is upset at me because I didnt get Debbie anything for ""Sweeties Day"". My augurment: I didnt know. She didnt really care either so its ok. Still, though. Sweeties Day is a crappy hallmark holiday that was made so that hallmark could make cash. What a stupid idea that many fell for.

I got to talk to Debbie and then she had to go because her family was watching a movie. I got to ask her about her dat and hear her voice, so im happy.

My dad installed a door today and he got all angry because I quoted him as being the re-incarnate of Jesus. I said this because Jesus was a carpenter and my dad was trying to do some carpenter-like work. He got all angry because I called him a Red Coat and told him he didnt know what he was doing. He was angry at the time but later, he said the quote at the top. 

My dad was super-cool and got Gabe a Ring Of Destruction off Ebay. He ordered it and when it arrives, Gabe is going to be estatic. I hope he gets me a Destiny Board. That would be awesome. If you get all 5 pieces of Destiny Board it spells FINAL and you automatically win the game. I got I,N,A and L. All I can spell with that is ANAL and that doesent get me anywhere. (I got an extra A) Destiny Board counts as the F and is the hardest part of FINAL to find. 

Sorry I got all dorky on you guys. Gabe sucked me into the game in the first place.

I got into an arguement with my dad becaus my brother sat on my clothes in my room and got them all nasty with his gross goblin-like feet. He shouldnt have even have been in my room and he was a prick about it when I told him to wash my clothes. Fuck him. He is a 13 year old asshole because he lives partly with my horrible mom.

Now I got no shirts and my pants were partly ruined. If I show up to school without a shirt, you'll know why. My damn brother. Jerk.

Patrick was cool about it when I stormed out of my house. I slammed the door closed and I kicked my fence because I was really angry. My dad was siding with my brother and my brother was being a total douche. 

Patrick told me to ""calm down tiger, you might hurt yourself"". Even if I was in a fit of rage, I had to laugh at that. He also reminded me of the last time I kicked a fence. Then we walked to my corner and we talked. We went to jewel and got some of that fake webbing they use on houses, like my house. My dad asked me to get some of the stuff before we argued so I did that to burn off the anger. Sure, I got the crappy webbing, but I got it in the maddest way possible. Im glad Patrick was there. He was a real friend when I needed him. I think I learned something from that. 

You might not read my Livejournal Patrick, but thanks. I owe you one.

That was about it for my day. I gotta take a shower and do stuff. 

I miss everybody. 

I guess this will be my FINAL Livejournal entry for the day. Lol. Im a geek."

"event","Yesterday I went to a Yu-Gi-Oh tournament. I sucked at it but I went more to see Gabe and stuff. I was paired with a cheater who miracariously got 3 ground collapses on the field. These cards, when used in unison, dont let me summon any monsters at all and there was nothing I could do about it at all.

Whatever, what goes around comes around. Revenge is sweet.

Actually most of the kids there were social outcasts. All I had to say upon my loss of the tournament was that I had a girlfriend and none of them did. They didnt even know what a vagina was. All they could do was make penis jokes and call everything ""gay"". What morons.

Dale came over to my house and we palyed Yu-Gi-Oh. My deck is pretty kick assed. And I added a new card to it. Its called the Barrel Dragon and it owns ass. When you summon it, you flip 3 coins, if you call them right, you get to kill one monster on the field. And it has 2600 attack, whick beats a summoned skull.

I was actually pretty bored this saturday. I planned to go to Navy Pier today for my art classes art report but I dont know if that going to happen. Oh well.

I wanted to go to Navy Pier with Debbie but she cant. That sucks. I called her yesterday and we talked for a while. At the concert on friday we were talking and she said that I always wanted to make out too much. I guess shes right but I never see her. Shes right though. I guess I wont ask to ""do stuff"" so often. Our relationship isnt based on that. I want to be with her because I really like her. 

I miss rain, my Friends and Debbie. I want to organize something where we can all hang out. That would make my month.

On halloween, Im going to be Jay and gabe is going to be Silent Bob. We are going to go trick or treating and were going to get so much candy. If anybody wants to get in on this, that would be awesome. Theres supposed to be a party at Mr. Glasers house with Debbie and (freshman) Holly there but I promised Gabe that I was going to get candy with him. I never break my promises, much less my word. 

Gabes birthday is on the 22nd of october. Im going to get him some Magicians Force boosters. Thats what he wanted so ill get him that. I was going to get him a really good single card, called Ring Of Destruction but thats worth a lot of money. Maybe ill get him that instead. We'll see.

Mr. Pedtitto, you rock the world with your awesomeness. 

Nicole! you were so cool at the concert friday that im still peeing blood because of it. Only members of Random Outburst usually get me to do that. 

Holly. You. Are. So. Cute. It. Makes. Me. Explode. You sit there and you smile and like, everyone in the room goes from borderline comatose to ""WOAH! DID SOMEONE JUST KICK ME IN THE BALLS?"". Its kinda like that. You give really good hugs to boot. 

I say these things because I never see Holly and Nicole and they need extra attention on Live Journal. Geoff, we need to plan something really cool so we can hang out because I dont see you a lot either. 

Woah! Candy!

SNL now sucks ass. I saw it yesterday and Halle Berry is a total douchebag. She did some shitty stuff, like a hit and run while drunk, so I dislike her strongly. She also is not funny. What were they thinking?

I want to be young again so all I have to worry about is candy and if I have to go to preschool in the morning, because at 6 years old, I didnt have the days of the week memorized. I also want my diaper changed, but thats a whole different story."

Just took my Tae Kwon Do test!

Im a purple belt now! Now I get to kick ass in a purple belt! Woah!

Ok, that show yesterday was the best. I got to see Debbie and Nicole and Sean and Amy and Allison and Geoff and like, everybody who has ever been a Friend of mine. I tried to get Gabe to come and stuff but he was busy so whatever. 

In sequential order:

Half day at school, ""fun fair"" rest of day. Chris dissapeared and Debbie was sick. I got to see the strange play-like thing and me and Debbie kissed and stuff during it.

Day ended at 3:00 and I went to Su Vans until 5:30. Fuzz and I talked about stuff and Debbie. His girlfriend showed up. Strange enough, her name is Nora. She seems cool, she better not cheat on him like his old girlfriend did. 

I left Su Vanns and jumped on the red line and got to Jones. Lena, Ben and Nora (from school) and I all waited for Cabaret to get out. Lena and I went to White Hen and I got pop tarts, vanilla and chocolate milk (one was for Debbie) and a grape crush for Lena. The pop tarts were to be shared among everybody. They werent.

I picked up Debbie and we left to the concert. We got off at Cermak and Chinatown and walked along the 18 bus route. We just followed the sighns and disreguarded the maps and things we got altogether. Lena, Debbie and me all went to the concert this way. 

We got to the concert and I DIDNT MISS 2 LEFT FEET. That was really cool. Im kinda glad that everything was held up because I got to see good bands and only missed The View From Here. Sobun and I went to this corner store and got him some tea. That was cool. I never get to hang out with Sobun and hes an awesome guy, who just so happens to attract total whores most of the time. The whores are people like the two freshmen who hang out after school and hug everyone thinking they are not going to get the freshman stigma.

Anywho, I got to kiss Debbie a lot and touch her a bunch. That was one of the best parts. I got to see Debbie. She was so beatuiful and hot and rad that I was in a state of euphoria. Awww man dudes. Wow.

I was worried about Chris because after they had a ""crappy"" show he acts like a total jerk to everyone because he feels bad. Hey, guess what. I dont like that. You dont treat Friends like shit when you feel bad, espically if its over something that, in my opinion, youre wrong about. I tried talking to him a couple of times and he just walked away. Thats fucked up. I could be on my very deathbed and if one of my Friends wanted to tell/talk to me about something, I would still listen. Maybe I dont know what im talking about and im just being an idiot but that still sucks. Dont treat your friends like crap, people. They are humans too and you cant just step on them like that.

I helped 2 Left Feet put their equipment away a bit and Ms. Mostead was there. That was neat. 

Oh, I saw Sean there and his brother, William. Who laughs at all penis jokes I make. Hes a cool guy for that alone. Sean, on the other hand, was so rockin I cried and peed when I saw him. I didnt give him a hug when I first saw him because when I did see him I had been kissing Debbie 2 seconds befor and I had a monstrous boner still. Even when I did hug him, I think he still got a little woody. Well, thats a present that just keeps giving. 

Sorry about that Sean. Will got a boner out of me only because he had that whole ""Im mini-Sean and I got a du-rag in my glove compartment."" Also, I gave Seans brother a sickers wrapper for an emergency condom. You never know when you gotta fill something with nuts.

I just read that and I laughed my ass off.

Oh, I saw Christina and Lena doing some stupid, provacative stuff. Thats not cool at all. I personally didnt watch, I have a girlfriend and I believe thats kinda wrong. Lena has a girlfriend and that was a dumb move. Christina was also doing this with other people and I was not impressed. Geoff was all like ""WOAH LOOK AT THAT!!!!"" While he was sitting on Crystals lap. That, my friend, was not smart either.

Apart from that Geoff was THE AWESOME MASTER. He taught me to skank and I will owe him for life because of that. I was not really good at skanking, but I never said I was so theres still room for improvement. When I was moshing I got nailed in the jaw and got my inner cheeks hurt. Im fine though. I just didnt want Debbie to taste my blood when we were kissing. Unless shes into that......

I went home and got home at like 12:08. I went to bed A.S.A.P. because I had a Tae Kwon Do Test in the morning. 

My dad just ranted at me about me not doning my chores well enough. I guess I'll have to work on that. 

Alright. That was an awesome show and I really miss all you guys and Debbie. I want to schedulel a party at my house. That would be fun.

Chris, it might have sounded bad, but it was an awesome show. Learn form your expiriences and grow from them.

"event","1) I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow
and asked loudly, ""How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow
job?""  I turned around, walked back out, and never went back. My
husband didn't say a word... he knew better.

2) I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I
was unhappy with the women's type I had been using. After browsing for
several minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen
who works at the store. He asked if he could help me.  Without
thinking, I looked at him and said, ""I think I like playing with men's
balls.""

3) My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a
variety of nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy
behind the counter asked if we needed any help. I replied, ""No, I'm
just looking at your nuts."" My sister started to laugh hysterically,
the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away. To this day,
my sister has never let me forget.

4) While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to
release some pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab
hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other
patrons. I told her that if she did not start behaving ""right now"" she
would be punished. To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in
a voice just as threatening, ""If you don't let me go right now, I will
tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!"" The
silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the
tellers stopped what they were doing. I mustered up the last of my
dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow. The last
thing I heard when the door closed behind me were screams of laughter.

5) A lady picked up several items at a discount store.  When she
finally got up to the checker, she learned that one of her items had
no price tag. Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on the
intercom and boomed out for the entire store to hear, ""PRICE CHECK ON
LANE THIRTEEN, TAMPAX SUPER SIZE."" That was bad enough, but somebody
at the rear of the store apparently misunderstood the word ""Tampax""
for ""THUMBTACKS."" In a business-like tone, a voice boomed back over
the intercom. ""DO YOU WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE
KIND YOU POUND IN WITH A HAMMER?""

6) Have you ever asked your child a question too many times? My
three-year-old son had many problems with potty training and I was on
him constantly. One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in
between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room. While
enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course, I checked
my seven-month-old daughter, and she was clean. Then I realized that
Danny had not asked to go potty in a while, so I asked him if he
needed to go, and he said  ""No.""  I kept thinking, ""Oh Lord, that
child has had an accident, and I don't have any clothes with me.""
Then I said, ""Danny, are you SURE you didn't have an accident?""  ""No,""
he replied.
I just KNEW that he must have had an accident, because the smell was
getting worse. Soooooo! I asked one more time, ""Danny, did you have an
accident?""
This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over, spread his
cheeks, and yelled. ""SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!!""
While 30 people nearly choked to death on their tacos laughing, he
calmly pulled up his pants and sat down.  An old couple made me feel
better by thanking me for the best laugh they'd ever had!

7) This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a
very embarrassed female news anchor that will, in the future, likely
think before she speaks.  What happens when you predict snow but don't
get any....a true story...
We had a female news anchor who, the day after it was supposed to have
snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked: ""So Bob,
where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?""  Not only did HE
have to leave the set, but half the crew did too they were laughing so
hard!"

Aww, man dudes. Debiie is so nice. I really like her and I want to see her every second im not actually seeing her. I want to hold her and kiss her and do stuff with her. Even when I blink and I know shes right in front of me I miss her. 

Oh, guys, Im not Mr. Rick. I have not forgot about you guys and I want to hang out with you too. Time limits suck and I want to see everyone. Oh man. 

Tomorrow goes like this: 

I go through my school day and kiss ass, per usual to the teachers.

I go talk to Geoff and tell him I have to go to band practice. 

I go to band practice with Mr. Menzies. I get out of the school.

I meet Geoff and Crystal. 

We hang out till 6:30, when I pick up Debbie. 

We get on the red line and ride it to Cermak/China Town and get off.

We walk to Mr. Peditto's house.

We pay for tickets and have fun.

I try to make out with Debbie.

I make out with Debbie.

The universe becomes perfect.

Okay, I simplified that. From what, I dunno. Tomorrow is going to rock and im going to try to see Debbie as much as possible, as well as everybody else. You guys know I love you. 

Nicole and Holly. You guys I dont see a lot but from what I do see, you are good, if not great people. Nicole, knows where all the kick-assed shows are and Holly is sweeter than the mosy tasty of candy. I wish I saw you more. That would be coolness to the max.

Everybody else (Nicole and Holly too). Well, for one blanket statement, you all got at least a couple rewarding parts about you. You are all my friends and for that I am forever grateful. I cant put into words how good it feels to have a whole grid of friends that would back me up through thick and thin. If I didnt have you guys, I probably wouldnt be as good of a person as I am. I might have turned into an Allen Miller or a creepy weirdo, like, Mr. Smith.

Kirstin! I know you read this. Its a fact. Hiya!

I just tried calling Mr. Hastings. He was at a show. Yep.

I got to take a shower. Im tired. 

My dad and his girlfriend told me that Debie will ""eventually get tired of me"". Why would they say that? I dont say that about THEIR relationship. Thats inconcedirate.

I get to see Debbie tomorrow!

I get to see my Friends tomorrow!

Yes, I capitalized Friends. I think I'll be doing that from now on."

I cant see Sean because I have ""work to do"". MY FUCKING MATH. I HATE IT SO MUCH. 

I want to go to the concert friday, but im trying to plan it with Debbie and its not working. I cant go with Debbie, see 2LF and get a car rid ethere all at the same time. I need help on this. Debbie gets out of Jones at 6:30. If you could help me I would do any favor you asked in return. 

I AM going to the concert. Even if my grandpa is playing a part in a play. He has 3 weeks for us to see him. Plus, he said that thing about south siders. Im not too thrilled about that either.

I went toi ALLAS with Debbie to spen some time with her. We got to hold hands and talk. Im happy about that. Also, I took her home from the blue line, going out of my way. I got to kiss her on the train and even if some dude did jerk off to it, im fine. He didnt hit me in the eyes with his load. 

After that, we got off the blue line at her stop and she waited with me for the next train. While we waited, we got to kiss and stand up, at the same time. I really like her. All this thoughts about Debbie makes me a bad typer.

School was nice today. At the beginning of school I got to see Debbie. We held hands and I couldnt stop smiling. I felt all nice inside. My guts were like, ""good stuff, man"". I went on until 3rd period, when I got to walk Debbie to the 6th floor. She went to biology and I wanted to kiss her, but I didnt have the guts to do it. I dont even know if I should. Later, I got to see Debbie after school for 15 minutes. We held hands some more and I felt all tingly again. 

Good stuff.

In lunch, I got to buy Allison a lemonade. Mr. Peditto is like really smart. All should know this. 

Even later after school I went to the Kool Kids Klub. Thats how I'm going to spell it. We played music there and Super Smash Bros. I'm bringing Perfect dark next time and an extra controller. We listened to Andrew W.K. and we square danced to him. Shweet.

I didnt get a hug from Kelsey today. I felt bad because of that. 

Mr. Owens is a CRAZY MOFO. He took Ms. Reynolds temporary I.D. and gave her a detention. She was also kicked off the table we were all sitting at in Scholars Chemistry. I went to the table we usually sit at (where she had to sit because Mr. Owens was being senile) and kept Lena some company. She didnt have that coming.

I went with my grandpa to a Thai food resturant. He said this ""Only bad come from the south side"". I replied with this: ""Well, I have very good friends from the south side, I would take bullets for these people. I really dont see my self doing that for a 'bad person'"". That was a zing grandpa. Zing.

I went to Su Vans and I helped Colin with some of his chores around the cafe. I restocked the drinks and got a free cookie out of it. I also put some money in the quater machine next to his car for him. I do things like that. If he does the math, he might figure out that SOMEONE put a quater or two in the machine. Just so he wouldnt get a ticket that would put him down 50 bucks.

THEN later I called him (around 9:00) and his mom said he was ""going to be busy all day"". This was after he told me to cancel any plans I would have had yesterday. Gabe even tried used the ""im your BEST friend execuse"" to make me try to cancel. I didnt cancel anything because I know his plans. His parents think they are more important than everything else. Prick ass parents.


Im glad I didnt cancel my plans with Debbie (not that I would have). I used my school pass to get on the EL. I was suprised, I didnt think it would work. But it did. Sweet. 

I caught a brown line train and transfered to the red line from Belmont. I got off at Jackson and waited for Debbie. Like, 5 minutes later, I met her and I couldnt stop smiling. My mouth was all dry and stuff. 

We got on the red line and took it in reverse to Paulina, where Su Vans is. We got off and walked the half-block it takes to get there from the train station.  We got to Su Vans and Fuzz was very suprised. I told him Debbie's name and he was like ""cool"". We sat down and got some food. She got a brownie and I got a cinnamon muffin. We talked with Fuzz for a bit and ate. 

After talking with the always-uber Fuzz, we went to my house. We took the scenic route, and it was soooooooooooooo nice. I got to my house shoed her around a little and then there came my room. Yes, we made out. Yes, it was awesome. And no, we didnt do anthing more. We were bust until 4:08, when my brother and dad came from their trip to the Zoo. We both were startled and I think my dad knew what was going on. He didnt see us, per se, but he heard us I think.

My brother was like, ""Hey, theres two Riordans?"". I guess, we look a bit alike. TO A BLIND MAN. Lol, good times.

My dads currently going to turn the pumpkins that are rotting in the front of our house into brownies. Gross.

I got past the part I was stuck in, in Viewtiful Joe. Hulk Davidson got it up the fucking ass. I owned that Rhino-on-steroids. I actually did this right after I got home from dropping Debbie off. Is she a good luck charm? We'll see.

Awesome day. Awesome Debbie.

I will see Sean again soon, I dont know how, but I will. Grrrrrr! Also, Mr. Peditto, YOU ROCK. 

Question: Do I tell my dad about Debbie? Mrs. Bruckman said no, so im doing that currently.

Fuzz works monday mornings and he might like to see her. I told him about my recent movie endavor and he was all like ""good work"". I think this will work.

Sorry I missed the concert guys. I would have gone, but my dad said I had work to do at home. It sucks. Oh well, theres always more concerts.

Well, I didnt.

(Sticks tounge out). Perfect.

I went to the same Hobby shop with dale last week, today. I bought some card protectors and stuff. Yeah. It was cool.

I woke up, and went to Tae Kwon Do. Turns out, I can kick from maeg-far away. I got the longest legs ever. Michael Jordan, feel my wrath.

I got home and called Gabe and Fuzz. They both are busy all weekend long. Crap.

Dale then arrived at my house and I told him to calm down. It was really early still (for me). I had to go run an errand with my dad and Dale chose to come with. 

We had to get a ladder for some scaffolding work that needs to be done on my house. We got the ladder from my grandpas, who lives in Barrington. We got the ladder pretty fast, the hard part was tying the sucker down. My dad has a Subaru with a ski rack on top. We usually use this rack as a sort of holder for papers and the occasional small mammal. My dad got like, 50 million bungee cords and tied that ladder onto the car. 

We got home, unloaded the ladder and did stuff with it. 

My neck kinda hurts because my head was bent for so long. Nice, I got make out pains. I called Debbie right after we were done with the ladder and right when I got home from the hobby shop. Yes, I am her boyfriend. so HA!

Im going to meet her at jackson on monday and bring her to Su Vanns. Its as good as place as any and Fuzz might get a kick out of seeing someone I made out for an entire movie with. Debbie is soooooo awesome. You guys are too. 

Viewtiful Joe roxxors my boxxors.

Im better than Rick at maintaning a balance. Loser! :D

Oh, I might also be able to go to the Mustard Plug Cconcert at the Bottom Lounge. My dad all the sudden said ""well, we'll try to leave that christening thing as soon as possible, I know you wanted to go to that concert thing""."

Latin is the accepted copying time of Period 9 homework. 

Allison was all depressed today, and that made me sad, shes a great person. I dont know whats going on at home, but I KNOW shes cool. She has the whole ""im cool, but ill kick yo ass into da ground"" vibe. I dont know whats up. I just dont like that an awesome person is sad a lot. 

Today me and Chris were trying to get our comedy on. Not enough time to make many jokes, but it was good. The crappiest teacher around, Ms. M was not there today. Instead, we had our REAL teacher Ms. C. She was pretty nice. We did a little note taking. I can do that. Anybody can do that. Monkeyes can do that. I did it. About Ms. M, I dont think she is a bad teacher per se but she in very new at it. Thus, crappy. 

Mrs. Murzyn is really neat. I suck at learning, shes good at teaching. How about that?

I went to Starbucks with Sam, Debbie and her friend. Gabi, Kelsey and Fran were also there. I didnt know who to talk to. Talk to Kelsey and Gabi? The people youve known longer and better? Or talk to Sam and Debbie? Future girlfriend and their buddies? Desisions like that suck. I just walked both sides of the street. I got to talk to both peeps. 

I ate a muffin I got from Su Vanns yesterday. Colin told me it was going to be bad news for my taste""buddies"" but it wasnt. It was good, next time, I am getting another one.

Woke up late today. Alarm didnt go off. Bitch clock. Ima kill you by unplugging you.

The Cello is great but I still have no clue on how to use it. I want to learn how, just not in front of a whole class that DOESENT play the Cello.

I called Sean and woke him up again, this might be the third time or so. Im sorry dude, its either bad timing or just bad luck. Sorry anyways. Atkins owns major ass.

Pirates are pussies.

Debbie? Oh yes. 

Today was kinda blah. I got to think about stuff in metal smithing. In metal smithing I got to snad a CD. Turns out, CD's are filled with horribly poisionous chemicals. Sanding a god damned CD let me expirience these chemicals first-hand. 

I had to think long and hard about some stuff in metal smithing. What, I cant remember, why, I dunno. I just thought about it and I felt sad. I cant evplain the feelings I had, they were just sort of like being depressed for a short while, knowing that the world was around me. 

School was kind of a put down and I had a pretty serious discussion about stuff with Mr. Peditto. It wasnt about anything bad, just some things about the ladies. A lady is what I want and after today I think its what im going to get.

After school I hung out with Adam. Adam is actually pretty cool. He let me borrow his Foo Fighter Cd, so I can copy it. He is like a dude you can sit with and have a good, funny, conversation with. Hes not too serious about crap and hes cool. Unlike Mr. Ng, who was also there. Now thats a loser.

Mr. Menzies is da coolest cat evah. He wates many classes but gets work done. Thats cool.

After, after school, I went to Su Vans. I met a crazy guy there. He talked about jesus being our savior, since he was crazy, I was inclined to agree. Also a lot about the Army, why a crazy dude knows a LOT about the army I dont know, the fact that Colin has the power to take this man out? I do.

Colin was his down self, as always. Ashley helped me with my homework for U.S. History. I couldnt read The Scarlet Letter, its just too boring. I got to help close shop, as always. I swept the floor and took out the trash. Yep, easy stuff.

I got home with a bundle of food, most of this being bagles and muffins that they had to get rid of. My dad saw me and got angry because I got home at 8:00. He wasnt angry one we talked and he saw the bagles. Oh well.

I like to make Allison laugh. I made her and Chris a poster. Its bad ass.

I miss Kelsey, I never see her, and shes an awesome person. 

Chris Peditto bought a sticker-maker. One more step closer to millionaire status peep.

I went to Oktoberfest with my dad. Turns out, Oktoberfest consists of setting up a tent, talking to people and then going to your tent in the wee-hours of the morning after you've become drunk. Very drunk.

I didnt drink or smoke anything because im cool-cat (straight-edge or whatever). I did meet a bunch of people and plugged Random Outburst even though I was WAY in the country. There were actual mohawk-teens there who were very into making bands. I heard them and they got everything. They even sound like Rancid a little. Their favorite bands were people like The Violent Femmes and Rancid. Pretty much, violent, metal music. 

Everyone hated Good Charlotte, I didnt have any beef with this.

I hung out with these kids and was suprised that EVERY SINLE KID except for one pasty-white dude, smoked or drank. I felt real sorry for them because most had ""City Horror Stroies"". These people just couldnt make it in the city so they turned to drinking/smoking. Great. Theres one frined that wont put you down, liquor. Oh, whos his friend coming down the walkway? why...its Mr. Cigarrets! losers.

Some of them were pretty cool but there was the whole underlying thing of their smoking. These dudes smoked a storm. They littered the ground with butts and crap, which I dont like at all. Respect nature man. 

I saw Dave and Mac there too. They had this HUGE tent that looked like a condo. It was less like a tent and more like a collapsable house. This thing was all for 30 dollars. Nice deal.

Also there was Dave and my dads friend David. Hes different from Dave, kinda. He recently got a wife (whos name is Sunday) and he just got a kid. Later in the night me and him got to talking and he was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy drunk/high. He sounded like a jamacian man, his exact words to me about him and him wife ""making"" their child was this: ""She-a puke on my should-a and I told her it O.K., we taka showa and it all be fine, we make-a child in da showa."" That was awesome. Hes so cool.

On our way home from this ""Haven"" I stopped by my Grandmas house. My Great Grandma was there too. We ate sauce-stuffed crust pizza and I kicked my bros ass in Yu-Gi-Oh.

Then I got home and now Im here, writing in my LiveJournal.

I gotta call Sean and take a shower. Later peeps."

"event","Okay, I had an awesome time yesterday. 

I went to the Bottom Lounge with Chris Peditto and I had the coolest time. The only thing that tops it is the Random Outburst concerts I have went to and then the Dakota Dakota show I saw.

I personally thought the music was really good. I had never heard these guys before and I was astounded. 

The 3 bands before them were O.K. I liked This Is Me Smiling and the band after them had 2 good songs. The strange thing was that NO ONE WAS DOING ANYTHING for the first 3 bands. And they had good songs. Me and Chris were boppping to the beat and stuff but for the most part we didnt do anything because we didnt wanna look like idiots being the only people dancing. 

After the show we went and got some pizza at this cheaply-priced pizza place. We also met this other, new, dude. He was cool and I cant remember his name. 

Today on school I learned that Sobun wants to hang out. Mr. Peditto said that im one of his best friends. When I thought about this I realized that he too, is one of my best friends. I know a lot of people and therefore I have many a friend, but if they all asked me to take a bullet for them I would pick a very select group of people to take bulets for. Chris Peditto would be in this group. Most of the people on this whole Livejournal shindig I would also take bullets for. 

You guys know who you are, and I love you. I hold my friends so high on my priority list its not funny. When someone asks, ""Can I have a dollar(s)"" and I give them the cash, or they need my help on something, I dont do it for my health. I do it because I value my friend over some crappy piece of paper/myself and I also want them to be happy. 

Its 2:28 right now and at 3:00-ish im going to Su Vans to see Fuzz at work. First, though I gotta refill my money clip+1 with some money. 

I tried calling Sean, not there I suppose. Oh, Chemistry was really cool today. Peep science is pretty intresting.

Next week I'm hoping to hang out with Sobun, Geoff and anybody else that wants to. Holly, sorry I forgot to mention you at the Ice Cream Social, I didnt really get to talk to you, so.........yeah. We gotta hang out too.

Later. Go music!"

I woke up today and I thought ""Crap, bad day, yes way"". 

This didnt happen. 

*relief*

I had a good day. I wanted to do something cool but it didnt happen. I tried to do something with kelsey of Gabi or Amy, but they all got responsibilities/punishments they must adhere to. I respect that but I really want to see my friends outside of school. Going out and doing something with Geoff, Sean, Amy, Chris, Lena, Kelsey or Gabi would be the best. Theres also the Posse Of Outlaws: Lee, Isaias and Willy. Man, those dudes are cool.

Today I missed Mr. Peditto and wanted to tell him that his singing OWNS THE EARTH. The moon too. I get to help Allison in metal smithing too. Shweet. 

After school me and Lena went out to White Hen. We got stuff. We also went with Adam. I think Adam knows how I feel when he said to me ""Im kinda looking for any human contact I can get"". Adam is Captian of Uberness. Im going to hang out with him more. During our trip to White Hen, we brought these two girls with. They are kinda....out there. Mr. Mendoza hangs out with them a lot. One put makeup on me. Weird to say the least. I have one thought on this though. The lipstick tasted like fish. Thats it.

Even after this I went to Su Vans. I hung out with Colin and Ashley. When they closed up shop, I got to help and got 2 bucks out of it. I pretty much swept the floors for them and they were like ""Thanks!"". After this is when they gave me the cash. I refused to take it, but Ashley threw it at me and told me a bum would eat it if I didnt take it.

My leg is feeling WAY better as of this morning. I can go up stairs semi-normally. I cant hop up stairs with my Ninja-like speed, but im not angry, thst will soon come. And then im kicking some monster ass. 

I watched sunday morning cartoons today and I was at Dales. He has cable so reception was no problem. I got to eat Trix at his house too! Yeah! best cereal ever.

Then there was saturday, saturday was really cool. I used the Metra for the first time ever. It went so fast it blew the El out of the friggin water. Why did we go to the suburbs, you ask? Simple. The prices on trading cards and crap are a lot lower and tax is not so bad.

Dale and I used this ""Metra"" to get to the GamesPlus store. This store has all the trading-card stuff you will ever need. I got to buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards. I got Metal Raider packs and wasted my money completly. I got 2 holos and theyre completly usless. I got Harpes Lady Sisters and Ganesha Elephantis. They look cool, but they suck and wont work well in my deck at all. Hence, theyre not going in it.

At the store I learned of a battle strategy game. It uses real pieces to represent small armies. Real geeky, but the dude at the store made it sound cool. We also watched a game and stuff. What was funny was the fact that a bunch of grown men were looking at small pieces and exclaiming shouts of joy. Weirdos.

I learned a couple of rules about this game from a referee-type dude. He was pretty nice and told us how the game was made and stuff.

When Dale and I used the ""Metra"" to get back into the city, we were met by Brendan, Dales step-dad. His whole attitude was ""Hey guys!"" 

This is when Brendan drove me and dale home and I spent the night at his house. When I spent the night there, I got to watch the G.I. Joe movie. It sucked. There were 2 Ninjas there, but they had guns. Ninjas dont use guns, they never have and never will. 

How dare they?

My biggest beef about this weekend was that I didnt get to hang out with any of you guys. I called like, everyone and you all either were not home or didnt pick up the phone. We all have to plan something. We got time, were young and ""rambunctious"" so lets do that.

If you read this, Im not a geek, I just hang out with them.

If you didnt read this, IM CRAZY!!!!!!!!

I was getting angry at this, he didnt need to be an ass. Espically in front of all my friends. The ways he showed off were like how a 4-year old acts. I play-punched him and he sits there and punches the shit outta me. He tottally used knuckles and I didnt. My punches are like something made of a substance that is not hard. Like bubblegum or shaving cream. 

What an ass.

Anywho, I had a crappy week. I was at Su Vanns and I was all down and out. Fuzz was like ""Dude, you look down"" and I was. I felt like crap and me thinking about it wasnt helping anything either. On top of this, Im not getting any more elevator passes. Mrs. Sanchez said ""this is the last one you get"" on friday morning. Great. More impending doom.

Me and Fuzz talked and that made me feel a lot better. Fuzz is like the bane to bad. If earth ever gets taken over by evil, all we have to do is make a catapult, put Fuzz in it and shoot him at the bad guys base. He'l obliterate the evil from his aura alone. 

One good thing that happened was friday moring at Jones. Peditto, Kraft, Mendoza, Zamuindo, Sobun, Bruckman and me were all there. And we talked. That was awesome.

After school, I went with Lee, Willy and Isaias to Dunkin dounuts. We poked fun at how much people have changed. I look like a dork, but oh well. 

I talked to Sean and he was like ""I worked 40+ hours....Ohhhhhhhh...........arg."" Yes, Sean is now a pirate. Hes the best dude ever. 

I just watched the Viewtiful Joe trailer for the video game and it was sooooooo coool. You need to see it. Even if you dont like Viewtiful Joe, you gotta watch it. Its really keen.

If you REALLY do want to watch it its at http://www.nintendo.com/games/gamepage/av.jsp?gameId=1653 THe link to watch its a little low in the screen window and it takes a while to DL and play. Its worth it though.

1. Learn to play the Cello

2. Learn to play it well

3. ""upgrade"" to base guitar

Oh yes. I tole Mr. Menzies about this and he said it was a good idea. Nice.

My day in sequential order:

Lunch: Crappy at best. No Peditto, no Bruckman, no Amy. Crap.

Metal smithing: Was yelled at for wastng materials twice. Dual crappiness.

Math: Got to talk to Allison and make fun of Sobun the whole time. O.K.

End of day: Went into elevator. Ghrai Harrison kept putting leg in elevator door and was an ass for no reason. I had to walk down stairs and hurt my leg. Also took anger out on freshies. 

After school: Went to thai resturant with Ben, Nora, Allen, Holly, Cobin, Alex and Andrew. Only two of these people I would take a bullet for. Hint: Holly and Cobin. I ended up paying 20 dollars when I only got a meal that was 4.95. Great. I lose again.
 
Other crap: Went to Su Vans. Fuzz was nto there but I got to talk to Rachel. Fuzz told me about her yesterday and said she was cool. She is. Colin was sage-like and plays base guitar. He is smart and knows how to play that base like a mofo. Stayed there till 7:00.

Patrick came over and we watched Invader Zim together. That show rocks. Its a good idea and was executed perfectly. If only it was on the air and I had cable.

Get well soon Kelsey! You might have a ulgy-fiendish type eye, but thats no worse than my leg. And my leg is pretty gross. Kelsey = never gross, always cool.

Patrick told me that most people in his school alraedy know about Random Outburst and want to play with them at shows and stuff. That is awesome. 

I went to the Gay and Straight Alliance meeting. It was pretty cool, I felt bad because I woke up late and got there while it was more than half-over. Next time, that wont happen."

School sucks, My friends rock.

Dudes. I had a school day and I lived. My leg hurts. I want to do something different than school, but I also want to see my friends. I like thursdays the most now. I get to see the most percentage of my friends that day (tomorrow). I get to see all my friends and ppes during the day and after school I see Fuzz and Colin. I havent been able to do much because of my knee/leg, I feel like an idiot because of how I got it and I think it could have been avioded.

Im giving up on Jasmine Moy. If her best excuse for not liking me is ""Fran likes you"" then I dont think she would make a good girlfriend anyways. Ill find someone else and there are others. I hope.

I was bet away by Chris and Cobin. Chris and Cobin were having a good time. I got to do stuff at Cobins table. I would have liked it better at Mr. Pedittos table but Cobin won the duel fair in square. Maybe next time Chris should go 5 out of 6.

The only part that was overlooked was the fact that Liz, Fran and Jasmine all have a table and always want me there too. All in all I have 3 tables I have to go to over the weekdays. 

Crap.

Chris Pedittos table is the bomb one. 

Metal smithing was all cool today. I got to file an anvil and I got to talk to this weird ""Visitor"" guy. He was pretty neat. He looked like an older Harry Potter and Mr.Rodgers hybrid. Strang indeed. I was dirty most of the day because I was sanding the anvil. That was fun.

Melissa was an ass today. I was limping up the stairs and she shoved me on purpose while shouting ""Move faster, dumbass"". She is such an jerk. I have to walk the stairs to Mr. Menzies and from metal smithing. If I have to limp she can have the common coutrtesy to not shove me. Its not like I have any of this coming and on the stairs I wasnt trying to be slow. Her and Luis have been asses to me all year, except when they need homework. Then im their best buddy! Oh joy! Im accepted if I let scumbags copy my work! Jolly me!

On a positive note, Im playing Cello for sure. It might be as big as a house, but Im going to play it.

Today there should be a party at my house for my dad and his ""buddies"". I dont know where I fit into this.

The only good part was Allison, because shes so cool and let me have some of her Fanta.

In lunch I got asked to do busybody work by Mrs.Lai. I told her I didnt want to get up and my knee was busted. He reply was this:
""Well, youre at school, so you CAN walk on it.""

Hey, bitch. Im a cripple as of friday night. I bust my balls just to get to school AND MY LEG HURTS LIKE A MOTHER FUCK. On top of this, I had to stand and do the god damned work. Fuck her. Fuck you Mrs.Lai, you old bastard. 

The only compensation of work that she could do was give us ""service learning hours"". You think a hour of community service is going to reverse the pain in my leg? Well, its not.

Ok, my school day was pretty crappy. We know this. Then I get to the courtyard. I talked to some friends and then people started to do stuff. I went to the CD store with Ben, Nora, Alex and Allen. I sit there and look at some shitty CDs, then I look around. The people I went to the store with? gone. I couldnt find them anywhere. I decided to leave and that was that.

I rode the red line home, or what I thought was home. It was going the wrong way and I ended up at Chinatown (where it smells like chinese food all the time). I got off and went the right way. I took a nap and by this time it was rush hour and all croded like on the eL. A person with an injured leg on the eL? not a good mix.

Oh, I had to walk all the way home. Thanks again Mrs. Lai for warming up my leg. 

I got home and gave Patrick a call. He came over and we talked about stuff and he got me a shirt and a pair of pants. Hes cool like that. Indirectly or directly, he helped me get a desighn for my next Metalsmithing project. 

I called Gabe. He had homework to do so he stayed home. Yeah, great prioritizing there. 

Im tired and I want a shower. Goodnight peeps.

I feel like crying. Im sorry I sound depressed, I had a bad day.

And thanks for trying, Mr. Peditto. I still say she doesent like me."

"event","Man, I was like so tired today.

I went to school and got an ELEVATOR PASS. I tells ya, theres nothing more rewarding than making a teacher feel stupid when they say ""Wheres YOUR elevator pass, bitch?"". The funny thing is when I say ""Oh, you mean this, Cocksucker?"" and I show it to them. They feel like an ass.

Needless to say, im milking this for all its worth (and thats a lot).

I went to school and had a pretty O.K. day. For my situation, I was lucky beacuse it could have been a lot worse. I didnt have a doctors note for my leg-wound. Ms. Sanches could have been like ""tough shit kid"" but she wasnt and was cool instead. 

I got to see Mr.Peditto at lunch and I have to admit hes pretty cool. Mrs. Bruckman (sp?) is cool to because I needed advice and the two had totally different ideas on what I should do. If you want to hear my problem read the next paragraph, if you dont, skip it and know that ima kill you while youre sleeping.

Ok, my problem is this. Jasmine Moy doesent want to go out with me because she doesent want to hurt one of her friends ""feelings"". This friend is Fran McKearn. I know Fram likes me but im not sure if I like her ""that way"". Therin lies the problem. I want to go out with Ms. Moy but I cant because Ms. McKearn likes me and stuff. Another look on this is that Jasmine is just looking for a excuse to NOT go out with me. This makes me feel like crap and I hope its not the REAL problem.

I came from school and stuff and then I went to Su Vans. Ashley was there and so was Colin. I learned how to pronounce Colins last name. It sounds like De-kiper. I think. I was talking to Ashley about all kinds of stuff and I left Su Vans at about 6:30. I limped all the way home. It sucked. At Su Vans I ate a piece of cheesecake and a chocolate milk. The cheesecake was rich beyond belief and before most of it was gone I was full. Oh well.

Me and Colin were talking about his rock group, Dakota Dakota (sp?).  I gotta get one of their CDs because theyre pretty good. Ashley talked about how she got food poisoning from a resturant called Far East. Dont eat there, youll get food poisoning. Like Ashley.

I got home and turned on the computer. I then fell asleep and didnt wake till 10:10. I feel like I shoud go back to sleep.

During this time Patrick came by my house and fund me passed out. Next time I want him to wake me up because I feel like an idiot.

Im sorry work sucks Sean, and I miss Kelsey. I never see her and it sucks because shes a really cool person. Same with Sean but he KNOWS hes cool (or he better...). Ther is like 2 levels of cool here. Sean is like ""Im smart and im cool and I know it"". Kelsey is ""Im cool but im not going to say im cool so you have to see if im cool"". Got it? good.

Amy, please go to school. I dont want you flunking out its too early for that and you at friends at Jones. Plus youre smart as hell and stuff. 

Chris Peditto and Allison Bruckman, you guys are like an ice cream sunday with sprilkles and hot fudge. This means you are edilble together. Or something like that. You know you guys are the awesomest. Nuff said.

I wanted to do some friend review. There ya go. Now, sleep. Later."

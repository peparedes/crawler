"event","That was such a weird night.  I was really high.  Brian drank so much vodka.  

Mine is really sensitive.

I wonder if I can change that.

What else could it be?

You could use it as a big mouse pad.

Thats crazy.  Craziness.



That area... Oh theres just a few double wides on each side... Oh!  You live in a trailer park?!?  

Check!  You have to check!  I'm going to go check in my room...

Its about a bitch who double crossed him and he wanted to get revenge!  Muff... ugh its such a gross word, its disgusting me right now.  Because everything down there is muffled...

Round of applause for nestle toll house.  Because they make fresh cookies to stoners!  Back in the day making cookies was a chore!  You needed flour... mixing bowls...

FROZEN PIZZAS as well!

Nah nah nah nah!  La la la la!  Nah nah nah nah...

Damnit!  Its coming!  WE HAVE PICKLES!"

I'm quite sure i could automate it and use pre-cut strips of photopaper in a standard deskjet; but that'd require a dedicated computer.

I found this while looking for an answer to a question about terminal velocity of free falling fluids.  After studying all the viscosity curves and temperature/fluidity curves, it's really interesting to see what how something visually reacts.  Thinking back on it, the only thing i can remember being told about the physical appearance of a non-newtonian fluid is that it's corn-starch or ketchup.  Anyone want to finance a kiddy pool full of a cornstrach solution in the name of science for me?

"event","Yesterday was my birthday. I had celebrated it during the weekend. i had so much fun. Saturday i had a bunch of friends come to my house to chill. All the people i had invited didn't show p because they had a field trip.
The people that showed up was Sarah, Jackie, Nick, Michelle, Andy, Ron,Junito, and Vanessa. We chilled and danced. We staretd playing with ice. We were puttig ice down peoples shirts and shyt. It was pretty cool. Michelle was staying at my house till 7. While everyone else was leaving my good homeboy Yemile showed up and chilled for a lil. Michelle and I wanted to go to the movies. So we talked her mom into letting her go to the movies. Then she told me to talk Yemil and tell him to go with us to the movies because she wanted to holla at him. So he said he would go. Then i called this guy Rigo that i liked since i was like 13. I told him to come with me so we could double date. So he said yes he would come. When we got in the movies Rigo wanted to get something to eat so i stood in line with him. I told Michelle and Yemil to go get a seat, so that way they could talk to eachother. While Rigo and I were in line this gurl came up to him and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He then turned towards me and said don't get jealous she was just a friend. 
Then when me and him went into the movies we sat next to eachother and started talking. When the movie started (""My Baby's Daddy"") He started holding my hand and had his arm around me. Then we started making out. Then he grabbed my hand again and started rubbing his finger on my palm. Then he said if i knew whut that meaned and i said yes. 
Then when the movies was over he took me home. My mom loves him. She said he is so sweet. I do too. Well n e wayz i guess i will tell you whut else happend tomorrow because Mrs.Capezza is about to start class, so i have to go.
And i am sad because Tom didn't go to my pary and didn't get my Pooh Bear."

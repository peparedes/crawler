"event","So i just got back from the doctor and apparently i'm down with a VERY&nbsp;VERY&nbsp;VERY&nbsp;VERY BAD FLU. I'm given 2 days mc, and if by friday i'm still not well, the mc is extended to Sunday. I should get well by then, if not its pretty serious and i gotta go back for review. I stumbled to the doctor in the most unglam state that you'll ever see me in. I&nbsp;was make-up-less, in the sloppiest outfit ever and i had my pouch on one hand, a tissue box in the other. Yes you heard it, tissue box. Its not even those packet/travelling kind, its those boxes you have at home. And by the time i finished seeing the doctor, i went home with an empty box! 

The worst news of all i weighed myself at the clinic and I LOST ANOTHER FREAKING 2 KG! That makes me 44Kg now. Mind you, just last year during my O levels, i was 52Kg. Omgosh, a total weight lost of 8Kg which is pretty unbelievable. For once, i am extremely sad about it because its taking a toll on my health. Plus plus, i can't fit into alot of my clothing because they're either too huge or too beggy which makes it really ugly, especially if you're talking about jeans/pants. 

Note to self, I MUST GET WELL BY SUNDAY! Please pray for me guys, i really can't afford to fall sick at this point of time. I'm literally fighting to stay alive just to get my assignments done. By praise the Lord, i just received an sms from Eve regarding my 4 articles that i've just handed in. I've received 4/5, individually for all 4 articles! Thats kinda amazing. 

Oh yes, and my apologies if there's any spelling/grammer mistakes. I just took a whole lot of medication that will cause drowsiness so actually in a few mins time, i'll prolly concuss on my bed or something. My motor skills are really screwed up right now. 

**Twin, i just wanna thank you for being there. I really didn't know who to cry to and i'm so sorry if i've gotten you involved in this whole saga. 
**R and S, just wanna say that you 2 are the best. Without you guys now, i'll probably die or something. (: Love you tons! 

**And to you, if you're reading this (which i know you would), i really hope you'll wake up and know that there are people around who still care. I am one of them."

"event","I had trouble sleeping, particularly last night. Infact i didn't fall asleep until 6 in the morning and even though i did managed to get some sleep, i finally decided to get up 10am. I feel absolutely terrible. For the past few days, i haven been eating much, sleep was also a problem. I had to juggle between work and school, at the same time, trying to rush through my assignments. Thank God at least i managed to clear 4 articles and the quiz. Now, i'm only left with my final group project, which i'm so not looking forward to. 

I think i've just lost alot of weight, AGAIN. In a few days time, if my fever and flu still persists, i'll prolly be in the hospital or something. Yes, its that bad. 

And i'm sorry to you, you, you and you. I did not choose you over them. That's the truth. Period."

Because i've only been able to get 2 to 3 hours of sleep everyday and i haven been eating well also. And i think i caught a cold while filming that day. It was raining like crazy, the winds were strong, we were freezing in our beach wear and had no jackets. We even resulted in using an umbrella as our jackets la!<br /><br />I'm really thankful to God for giving me this opportunity despite all these. I hope this is just the beginning. (:"

We had filming from 7.30am to 6.45pm. Can you imagine how tired we were. 
Please pray for me, i'm not feeling well.

Infact, i only had 2 hours of sleep. I wenta bed at 3am. I know, this is insane. While praying this morning, the power of God and his supernatural strength was upon me. I could feel his love saturating the hall and the sight of the 2500 people praying altogether in the morning is amazing! The whole hall was packed, even the stairs were filled! It was good, very very good! And i felt very refreshed after the whole thing ended. If you guys have the opportunity to go, please do.

And Calynne was eyeing on a bag from YSL too. We were saying that if we ever splurge on a bag that costs so much, we'll have to starve for 3 months or so.<br /><br />I was browsing through Versace's night gowns and stuff.

Laveen was my life saver yesterday! He came all the way to SIS to pass me the keys for opening! (: Thanks bro! It saved me a whole lot of trouble. If not i would have had to go all the way down to Tess's place at Chua Chu Kang, just to get it from&nbsp;her. Can you imagine?! Its like i would be going from the east, to the north(?) and back to SIS to meet up with my people and then back to my place which is north east. -.-!

Reached home at 2.45am this morning. Had supper with the gang and they came over to my place&nbsp;to visit (in my opinion), the world's cutest dog. LOL! By the time i hit the sheets, it was 4am!

I don't see why the media is so not over celebs going through plastic surgery. Bring this closer to home, i bet if i were to go for some plastic surgery to reconstruct some part of me now, my friends who are 'against' this will be bitching away and stuff. My point is, people are just bring sour over the fact that others have the money to make themselves look better and that they don't. Get a life man!<br /><br />Anyway, that aside.

First and foremost, you're possibly the only person who really understands how frustrating it is for people not to reply your email/smses/phone calls. It irritates the hell out of me cause it only goes to show that people in the world, including your friends, are very very selfish. But anyway, THANKS BABE.

I love working with you cause we'll haven never ending gossip sessions about anything and everything under the sun!

"event","Okay. So i've been really BUSY!!!! The last time i blogged was like 4 days ago! Which only explains why you guys haven been seeing me online as well. QI JI MAN! Cause i'm known for always being online, even if i were outside or something, i'll always be logged in on MSN, until its time for bed then my computer will be off. Hahas.

Anyway...... PLT!! I just got back both of my assignments and i've received high distinctions for both!! This is amazing! (: Since i've started school, i've given myself no excuse to not do well. As much as possible, i'mma try to get B grades and above for everything. I've been working hard okay!

Presetation last week&nbsp;came as a shock. Nobody was prepared, but at least my group managed to scrape whatever we have and just present it. So it wasn't too bad. Now that presentation is done, i'm only left with Fred's assignment (that is due on TUE!! OMFG, i've not started on a single thing). And just needa fine tune Siva's assignment, then i'm done with all the projects. Exams are in 8 days and honestly, i've not started studying. I-AM-SO-DEAD!

HOW NOW BROWN COW?"

"event","<p>Remember i mentioned that i wanted to get the Kate spade wallet/clutch bag or the Gucci one? Now i've changed my mind and decided to go for....................MARC JACOBS!!!! ((((((((((((: I know i'm spoilt. But its not that i demanded to get it, my beloved uncle decided to sponser me a 100 bucks to get whatever wallet i wanted. And he said that since i have a Gucci already, why do i wanna get back the same brand. Plus Kate spade is nice but when compared to Marc Jacobs, common sense would tell you that Marc Jacobs is better la! HAHA!!&nbsp;<br /><br />SO, i'll be going down to collect my fantastic wallet tomorrow! I CAN'T WAIT! Wa lao, i swear my ego was damn high while i was hopping from one store to another. I better not get into the details before i start getting nasty comments and everything. I went to Ferragamo and i actually quite like the wallets but Mom was saying that Ferragamo isn't me. And i'm still contemplating whether i should get my shades from Gucci or Marc Jacobs. What say you?<br /><br />Kayy, i better turn in soon. Doing opening tomorrow which means i've to get up early. ):<br /><br />XOXO.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>My life is pathetic, really. It basically revolves around school, work and church. Other then that, i seldom have the time to go catch a movie, or maybe just a date with my girlfriends. And while i'm typing this entry, i'm freezing my ass off at work. Yes, i've to work on Sundays, which suck by the way. Plus, i haven had my breakfast (<a href=""mailto:!@#$%"">!@#$%</a>^&amp;*) i'm like&nbsp;crazily&nbsp;hungry can. People ask why am i losing weight rapidly. My answer to you is that i only have one meal a day most of the time (not healthy, do not try this), and its taking a toll on my body. And i'll be at Marina from 10pm-1am tonight to help with the shifting and stuff. GEE, talk about having a life.&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition, tomorrow is the only day where i could really get rest and stuff. But no, i had to sacrifice the time to meet up with my group mates to get our project done on Evolution Psychology. My gawd, i needa take a break, sit back and just relax. You know, i'm even contemplating on getting my degree in Australia instead of Singapore next year, just for a change in environment. 8 more months till i'm done with this Specialist Diploma. Pfffttttt. Then again, it has its pros and cons.<br /><br />Planning for a trip at the end of this year. I seriously need one. Was thinking of going back to the states. My last trip there was 7 years ago. Or maybe Japan. Europe will be fantastic actually. We'll see how it goes, Mom would prolly go for Japan which is actually last on my list.<br /><br />Back to work.</p>"

So, i met up with Mommy for a mini shopping spree! (: Wanted to get&nbsp;a Guess bag but didn't see any that really caught my attention. I got a 6 inch wedges from Guess though. Mom got a pair for herself too, a different one. Bumped into Twin, it was hilarious cause we saw each other through the glass at the shop. Hahas!&nbsp;<br /><br />Went to Kate Spade to check out the bags and stuff and i fell in love with this wallet which could also be used as a clutch! Its gold on the outside and pink on the inside (damn bimbotic, but who cares)! I'm still deciding if i should get the Gucci or this one. HOW?! Get both?!&nbsp;But wait a min, who carries 2 wallets anyway. LOL!&nbsp;<br /><br />AND AND, i want the Kate Spade bag as well! Needa go plant a money tree outside my place. At the rate that i'm spending, i'm gonna go bankrupt soon. I'm still getting my Do denim jeans, CA and Ed hardy top that i've reserved&nbsp;this month.<br /><br />Oh and i highly recommend Dior's crayon eyeliner which i just bought ytd. Its waterproof/smudge-free plus it feels as though you've not applied anything on! Bye Loreal, i've moved on. HAHAHHAS!!<br /><br />Omg gotta run, i've tons of stuff to do right now!&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><strong>Note to self: Plan lil bro's upcoming bday bash!<br /></strong><br />xoxo.<br />"

"event","Work seemed like forever today. I did struggle to stay awake and it was kinda busy for me. Ben was suppose to come in at 2.30pm but some how or rather he didn't, and we were short of staff today. So when the crowd came in and i was working alone, it was no fun. I was frantically trying to get this and do that, the phone rang non stop for some reason and i was VERY tired.&nbsp;

On a lighter note, i got myself a Dior eyeliner. I love it! But there are still stuff that i needa get, like a whole list of them.

You know, i've been thinking of getting a tattoo for good. Just haven decided on the design yet. Any suggestions?"

"event","today was the moodiest day i ever had!!!!!  today started out ok.  me and meghan were passin notes 2 eachother during math.  Barnett has no fuckin idea.  and i was happy about all during school and then during english we got our term paper over romeo and juliet back and i got a 90 on it.  i was so excited.  then during track we did some blocks and all that shit cause we have a meet 2 morrow at city high.  and so we were workin on hurdles and they think morgan is the all mighty hurdler when i have better and faster times then her!!  I dont get it.  then we had showchoir and that was pretty pointless since we have the gayest directer ever. he does absolutly nothin.  and no 1 listens to him its just pointless.  i cant wait to be in xhilaration!!!  and then on the way home i was tellin my dad about the whole hurdle thing (u no try 2 include him in my life or whatever) and he goes all bizarc i was so pissed i didnt need him getting all over me.  but i cant wait for saturday when me and meghan get to go shoppin at lindale!!"

"event","I'm so frickin pissed off.  I got a note from one of my best friends ever since 5th grade, and we just got back from my sister's tourney, and i get a note from her saying we need a break, i was so confussed i didnt get any explaination or anything.  i started to cry during 4th period when i got it.  then during 8th hour she's in my class and she just ignored me and went on like nothing happend.  I did start to cry a little bit but i stoped cause we were in class, but when i got home i started walking and i was so mad and confused and while i was crying i was screaming at the top of my lungs ""Fuck this, why does this happen to me.  Why Fuck all of this""  I was so mad. I didnt no what to do then when i got home i started balling.  Then the next day i got a note saying that the reason she wanted a break was becuase of my attitude.  and that if i didnt change she wouldnt change.  I'm still upset it sucks so much!"

"event","This week as been awesome yet bad.  The good things first.  It's Catholic School's week and W.P.A. week(wpa means women pay all)  so each day is somethin special Monday was jeans and white shirt (because of the theme of Heaven) Then tuesday was clash day which was soooooooooooooooo much fun to pick out the outfit.  Today was Dress up day because we had mass, which was fun cause i got to see my little 6th grade sister.(she's soooo cute.  Ya right i lie she's a little devil) tomorrow is costume day that will be soooooooooooooooooo much fun.  Then i wont be at school on friday cause i'm in jazz band and we travel to the middle schools all day.  And i get to miss a big science quiz!!!!

But the bad news about this week is that since it's w.p.a week that means the dance is this weekend and i dont have a date, the guy i wanted to ask was already asked.  Lucky for me right.  Then in English we have this stupid term paper over Romeo and Juliet and i have no idea what i'm gonna do for that. (Is it bad that i didnt read all the play)"

"event","Omg Yesterday was HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!  you know that guy i was tell you about earlier.  Well it turns out that he dropped a class so now he's in my lounge.(you would think i would be excited right?) Well i'm not because it turns out that the girl he likes is also in my lounge. (just my luck right?) so that whole 48 minutes of class he talked 2 her not me.  I just wanted to die, and then when i say the way he looked at her i wished i could be her.  It doesnt help that she's gorgous eather.  

Then today wasnt much better, cause the night before i went to my friends house to work on a History project about Hitler and Nazi's and all that shit.  So i was soooooo woried about that then i had to get up at 6 a.m. for jazz band and i was tired all day, then we had to learn about this stupid denominator shit in math which were never use in real life) by this stupid teacher who cant teach and is soooooooo annoying thank God I have Meghan in my class so we can goof off the whole time.(luv ya girl!) and then i had to play my songs for this I.M.T.A thingy.  and on the way there my mom made me listen to 104.5 (I hate that station) and they played this love song.  I almost started to cry.  I just kept thinking about how he doesnt like me and how he likes this perfect girl.  This was a horrible week.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH!!!!  WHY CANT SOMEONE WHO I LIKE LIKE ME!"

"event","i'm very upset today.  k heres a question for you what do u do when u really liked this guy for a while and u really want 2 go out with him and your reall good friends w/ him.  The obvious thing right? (talk 2 him) well you do and your good enough friends that he tells u who he likes.  Now in your heart u no your hopin it's u.  But it's not of course.  and it really pisses you off cause u liked him for ever.  Well guess what it happened to me.  and i still like him it takes me forever to get over him but i dont want to.  And it makes me feel what does she have that i dont have and i start to get really self conscience about myself.  i just dont no what to do.  to day was a really shitty day."

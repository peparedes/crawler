My rating: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/48077331"">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I read this book in 2009 (Not sure which month, but it was released in paperback in spring, so likely a summer read). I read it again at some other point. Likely when City of Glass came out. And now I've reread it for the third time.<br />What can I say, I love this book. Heh.<br />It feels a bit like a fanfiction, at first, but with original characters and an original premise. This, I think, should not necessarily be off-putting, as a good deal of entertainment is to be had in reading fanfic, just as in reading this book. The characters seem typical until you allow them to grab hold of you. Then that bit of cynical ""Oh, paranormal teen stuff"" falls from your eyes like bad lenses. Wow, I really just wrote that. MOVING ON.<br />The characters are then quite easy to fall in love with, and the story maintains a fast pace which I enjoy. Although there is an overarching story line that ties the series together, there is still a satisfying enough conclusion to each book that keeps them from becoming one long book split into three.<br />In short, Cassandra Clare has embraced the fun and darkness and romance that come from all of -her- favorite books, and created something new and utterly enticing. I love it.

Blackout is very much on par with the rest of the series, which I find enjoyable. 
<br/>My few complaints have more to do with the editing than the story. 
<br/>I have no problem with the language (if you don't like cursing, you really shouldn't be reading these books anyway), but the often random placement of curses interrupted the flow of the story sometimes. Honestly, it seemed as though Ms. Thurman was asked to add in more curse words after she turned in her manuscript. Perhaps they said, ""Add in 200 more, we don't care where you put them. We need this to be EDGY."" (I find it amusing that crass language is sometimes all it takes to classify something as ""edgy"".) 
<br/>Curses can be used in many varied ways - adjectives, verbs, nouns even. But they still must obey the rules of grammatical structure. Otherwise, it just sounds wrong. That's all there is to it.
<br/>The other complaint was even more obviously editing. There were times when things were spelled wrong, or just clearly worded wrong - the kinds of mistakes we all make when drafting, and often miss when passing over our own work. One more pass by an editor probably would have helped the technical aspects of this book quite a lot.
<br/>These issues aside, it was a fun book, and a good concept for exploring Cal's character from a newish perspective. As I do love my tall, dark, and deadly Cal, I'm a fan of this.
<br/>I think Ms. Thurman has a little bit too much fun when it comes to delving into the perspective of a male protag (she really enjoys referencing his pecker, though to be fair, I don't think the obsession is at all uncharacteristic for a male of any age), but the running bathroom ""issues"" were amusing.
<br/>At the very least, I appreciate this opportunity to sound like a school teacher while reviewing a book featuring guns, monsters, and...well. Other things. Tee-hee.

My rating: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/138787795"">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This was an entertaining read, which is exactly what I was looking for when I picked it up. Without going into detail, I'll say that many of the elements that appealed to me in the first Percy Jackson book were present in this one as well. Again, I had fun guessing my way through Greek mythological figures and stories, and the way in which Riordan wove existing lore into a fun and still unique story is admirable.<br/>There were a couple instances of deus ex machina. Although I'm not a huge fan of that particular plot device, it wasn't so cheesy as to remove me from the story. <br/>I greatly appreciate Riordan's skill at creating a satisfying ending, while still leaving enough of a hook as to leave one wanting more. <br/>Good stuff.

"event","<div class='posterous_autopost'>       <p>I&#8217;ve had a very hard year. And this weekend just made everything get harder. I don&#8217;t need to detail, because we&#8217;ve all been there. To that point where we silently wonder, &#8220;How could this happen to me? I&#8217;m a decent person. What kind of world is this?&#8221; We never say it out loud, because to be honest we just can&#8217;t handle the social stipulation that comes with being a crybaby, or being blind to starving people in wherever, or what not.</p> <p>But we&#8217;ve all been there.</p> <p>I&#8217;m there now. Even thought I KNOW it could be worse, it still feels like this is THE worst.</p> <p></p> <p>I am fortunate to have some very good friends. Friends who don&#8217;t know what to do any more than I, but who will be there for me no matter what. And I&#8217;ve received good advice from them. Like the best advice often is, though, it is very hard to follow. It&#8217;s not new, but it always seems to come as a surprise each time I discover it. &#8220;Give it up to God, Abby.&#8221;</p> <p></p> <p>It&#8217;s some of the best advice a person can give when the solution is nonexistent. Doesn&#8217;t matter what religion or non-religion you are. Give it to God. Let it go.</p> <p></p> <p>Now the hard part &#8211; follow through. I am so &#8211;angry- and &#8211;hurt- that it feels impossible to let it go. I desperately want to, but I just &#8211;don&#8217;t know how-. But I&#8217;m working on it. For my own wellbeing. I&#8217;m scared, because this is very real, but fear is useless, and if there&#8217;s no way to use it, so is anger. So I&#8217;m working on it.</p> <p></p> <p>Oddly enough, I also picked up an article I&#8217;d printed weeks ago from an online convention called Write On Con. (<a href=""http://writeoncon.com/"">http://writeoncon.com/</a>) It&#8217;s by Molly O&#8217;Neill, an editor I follow on Twitter (<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/molly_oneill"">http://www.twitter.com/molly_oneill</a>). Though the Con was targeted toward writers of middle grade and YA fiction, her article is applicable to any kind of writer. Or, honestly, anyone at all. In her article, Molly gives one crucial piece of advice: Give yourself permission.</p> <p></p> <p>If you haven&#8217;t read it, I recommend you take a minute to do so now. It&#8217;s short and succinct. <a href=""http://writeoncon.com/2010/08/give-yourself-permission-by-editor-molly-oneill/"">http://writeoncon.com/2010/08/give-yourself-permission-by-editor-molly-oneill/</a></p> <p></p> <p>Give yourself permission. Not too different from Let it Go, but moving forward more. Reading this article I come to grips with how afraid of the future I really am. I can&#8217;t move forward, because I can&#8217;t let go. Both in my personal life, and the just-as-personal writing I&#8217;m struggling with. I don&#8217;t like how I am changing, moving away from anything difficult and becoming merely a survivor. I&#8217;m told this makes sense, given the stress in my life is at toxic levels. But I don&#8217;t like that. I want to thrive again. </p> <p></p> <p>Can I give myself the permission I need to let go of my flaws and my fears? Can I give myself permission to write something new, even if I never finished the old? I hope so. I hope so very much. &nbsp;It won&#8217;t happen overnight. But if I can have faith in my friends, maybe I can have faith in myself again. I know they have faith in me.</p> </div>"

My rating: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/50746119"">1 of 5 stars</a>
Read my requisite 50 pages, and am putting this one down. I may not pick it up again. What makes this harder is that the elements are THERE. It's like a Disney movie version of a romance novel, with a caring and dedicated hero, a damsel determined to be rescued one way or the other, and a whole host of very amusing sidekicks.
I really wanted to like this one, especially after I very much enjoyed the author's debut novel, Spirited Away.
I mean, come on, it's a romance novel. Not just a romance novel, but one of THOSE romance novels. The kind that you know ahead of time is going to be mushy and implausible, but hey it fills a gap in our lives, right? 
It's not like I was going into this with particularly high standards. Just looking for a fun read.
So I honestly, wanted to like this.
But Cindy, oh Cindy, where is your editor? Someone really should have told you that we readers can only take so many sayings of ""twas"" and ""betwixt"" and ""I vow"". And a hero can be attractive without constantly reminding the reader that he would make Hugh Jackman look plain in comparison. Really, it's true! 
This novel was sent out before its time. I know this author can write. But I think this one was put together with less care, and that's a bummer.

As always, I have no problem admitting that I love a good bad boy story. Cal is a perfect example. He's bad-ass, emo, swears a lot, wears black and likes to shoot things.
I love that.
For the most part, this book - the fifth in the Cal Leandros series - is a fun ride. I enjoyed reading it, and the bits from another character's view point were an interesting addition.
The downside is there are a few problems that seem to be cropping up in Thurman's latest works. Which I don't love, as her previous books are among my favorites. 
The voice is almost too strong - so much so that it doubles back on itself. There were a few times in the narrative I could not understand what he was trying to say. The wording was simply too mired in its own cleverness. Other times I could understand perfectly well, but that didn't stop me from rolling my eyes.
The plot itself really IS clever, and I can't much fault her there. I love how it winds along, and the resolution is perfect. The cast of characters continues to expand, which for the most part is ok.
The trouble is it takes very little to turn a brilliant book into an okay one. Very little. And in truth there is very little wrong with this one. If you like the other Cal Leandros books, you'll probably like this one too. I certainly found it amusing. 
It's not Thurman's best work though.

Honestly, I didn't finish this one. I tried. I meandered through this book for about a month, picking it up, putting it down. It just didn't grip me. The dialogue was good for the most part, and the premise seemed like it should have worked. It just...lacked. For those of us looking for romance in a romance categorized book, that explains a lot. I didn't finish it, but I got three quarters of the way through. There was some dating, but...romance was still not there.Sorry Hilary, but I won't be recommending this one.

This is a perfect formula romance, with totally cliche ingredients. Take one time traveling Scotsman. Add muscles and old-world values.
Toss in a modern woman with genius-level technological smarts. Stir in a liberal spoonful of strong will.
For variety, throw in a dash of family drama, and an ancient feud. Sprinkle with slight trauma.
Let simmer for length of book.
Viola! Yummy romance. And there's a reason the formula works.
Quite frankly, there really were times in this book where I thought, ""Seriously?"" because it did get overt. But for a girl like me, who does not mind it when a book makes her say, ""Awwww!""...usually this was not a problem.
Need a weekend chill out? Good book. Need a book to make you think? Not so much. But c'mon people, it's Romance. You get what you pay for, and that's good enough for me.

"event","Alright, it's not a secret I'm a big fan of what's been coming out of the Young Adult genres lately. There have been some really amazing author debuts, and new material that has really captured my imagination. Now, not all good YA can be found exclusively in a series, it's true. Still there's no denying that the genre is well known for them. So...With that in mind, I thought I'd make a list. A list of all the books I am looking forward to (hopefully) rereading in preparation for the release of the next installment in the series.<br />Why?<br />Because I have a blog, and I can.<br /><br />So, without further ado...<em><strong>YA&nbsp;B</strong></em><em><strong>ooks I Am Looking Forward to Re-Reading In Anticipation of their Sequels!</strong></em><br /><br />First up! This should be no surprise:<br /><strong>Eyes Like Stars, by Lisa Mantchev</strong> - Lisa's one of the awesome 2009 Debs, and ELS, I think, has the distinction in my world of being &quot;Book most frequently given as a gift&quot; by me. Because the more people who read it, the more people I have to talk about it with. Yeah. It's that good. <br /><em>Book 2 of the Theatre Illuminata series, Perchance to Dream, is headed to bookstore shelves this May.</em><br /><br /><strong>The Demon's Lexicon, by Sarah Rees Brennan</strong> - Another wonderful 2009 Deb (2009 was such a good year!). What a clever, clever book. Sarah takes the often-cliche bad boy, and spins that narrative around to his point of view. And an ending to knock off socks. But wait! Yes! There's a sequel! *whew*<br /><em>The Demon's Covenant is coming our way in May. </em><br /><br /><strong>Suite Scarlett, by Maureen Johnson</strong> - Whenever people ask me for comedy, I give them this. It's quick, clever, and you will laugh out loud. 'Nuff said, yeah? We're promised even more Spencer in...<br /><em>The sequel! Scarlett Fever, out next week!</em><br /><br /><strong>Fragile Eternity, by Melissa Marr</strong> - This is actually the third in the Wicked Lovely series (Wicked Lovely and Ink Exchange being the first two). I love Melissa's take on Faery, and how her books are not strictly one set of characters, but can change depending on which Faery Court has focus. She's clearly researched Faery and then come up with her own, beautiful spin on things.<br /><em>Radiant Shadows will be out in April.</em><br /><br /><strong>The Summoning and The Awakening, by Kelley Armstrong</strong> - Yeah, it's not fair, but it's almost painful to read one of these without the other. So Kelley gets away with making me reread two books. For those of you who haven't read these yet...you're actually pretty lucky. Because not having the third book after reading the second was um...hard. There was some yelling involved. But with the third book coming out, feel free to enjoy!<br /><em>Book three of the Darkest Powers series, The Reckoning, will be on shelves in April.</em><br /><br /><strong>City of Glass, by Cassandra Clare</strong> - The Mortal Instruments series is an astonishing product of imagination and damn good planning. City of Glass is the third, after City of Bones and City of Ashes (which I have already read twice, of course). It's become quite popular, and deservedly so. This series may be using Twilight's genre popularity to give it a leg up, but once you read these, you'll be saying, &quot;Edward who?&quot;<br /><em>The Clockwork Angel</em>, while technically the beginning of a new series, still includes the Shadowhunters created for TMI. <br /><em>This first book in the Infernal Devices series will be out in August.</em><br /><br /><strong>The Forest of Hands and Teeth, by Carrie Ryan</strong> - Another 2009 Deb! This was, dare I say it, a beautiful zombie book. No, really. It made me cry. (That's a big deal). The world that Carrie created is haunting, and her characters stay with you.<br /><em>The Dead-Tossed Waves will be released in March.</em><br /><br /><br />And that's not even everything! There are a lot of books that came out last year (and before) that I still haven't gotten to. Their sequels are coming out this year too. That's the trouble with being human. So many books, so little time. (And all that jazz...)<br />Feel free to hint at what I'm missing, if there are glaring ommissions.<br />2010 looks like a good year for Debs, too. I'm always up for suggestions on what to look forward to. <br />And, as always, free books are also always appreciated, should you feel so inclined. XD<br /><br />Check out my <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/jodotha/"">Goodreads page</a> for my reviews, and stay tuned for more."

Everyone knows I love Rob Thurman's Leandros series. It's not a secret. I talk about it, recommend it, even given the books as gifts. I'd follow Rob's writing just about anywhere. But this one? This one kind of hurts.
Trixa's your usual anti-hero character. She fights demons, owns a bar in Vegas, and has a well-hidden-but-still-there soft side. Yup. She's snarky and sarcastic. All the time. Never lets up. It's been awhile since there was a character that I actually wanted to reach through the pages and shake silly. And even longer since that character was the narrator and main protag. (Just once Trixa, just once, be sincere!) 
It felt like the author's way of writing herself into a story, in a way. I don't hold that against any author at all - certainly not. But it felt obvious, especially in the way she included gratuitous cameos from the Leandros series that didn't feel at all necessary to the story.
There are a couple of characters, though, that at times made reading this book an enjoyable experience, and boost my rating from one to two stars. I really liked Zeke and Griffin, two demon-hunters Trixa's taken under her wing. At the end there was some unnecessary and, quite frankly, gratuitous messing around with them, but the bulk of the book had me looking forward to their every appearance.
I did learn something, though. What NOT to do in my own writing. This is semi-spoilery, but more of a hint than an outright spoiler.
...
...
Ready?
OK. Don't lie to your audience. Seriously. Narrative voice should NOT LIE. Omit, twist, distract, sure. Characters can even lie to themselves and thereby to us - that's plausible deniability. But DO NOT LIE OUTRIGHT. We do not take kindly to being told a series of things IN THE NARRATIVE only to be told at the climax that it was all a lie. Surprise.
No thank you. That's not a plot twist, that's cheating. Don't do it. Tell the story from a different point of view if you must, but narrative should not lie.
And that right there is what lost this book another star.
Maybe if I hadn't had such high expectations, this would have been a gentler let down. But it was a let down, just the same.
There were times when I did enjoy this book, don't get me wrong. Laughed, gasped - all that jazz. I even stayed up late to finish it. But the overall aftertaste was bitter. Would I buy the next book in the series? Probably not. But I might check it out from the library. I still love Rob Thurman's other writings, so I hold out hope for better. I know she can do it.

I have a confession to make. After reading this novel, I have a huge crush on Harry Dresden. No, really.
This book, the third in the series, was amazing. The plot was twisty, and mysterious (genuinely!) and featured a you-name-it-we-got-it cast of paranormal characters. There were several times when I literally thought, ""There's no way he can get out of this."" And then? Then it got WORSE. One of the best examples of character-peril I've ever seen. I could write like that, but the difference would be the ending. In MY version, I wouldn't be able to figure a way out. But this guy Butcher? Master.
In my completely unprofessional but undeniably honest opinion? I am sold on the Dresden Files series. You should be too.

This was a good read - especially for those of us who already have a fascination with Tudor-era history. I would hesitate to call it a romance, though, as so much of the story did not revolve around the romantic relationship. That said, there relationship was always in the background, so I suppose I could understand the categorization.
The title itself is a bit misleading, as the main character is only directly involved with Catherine of Aragon for perhaps the first fourth of the book. After that, intrigue develops that involves a lot of historical characters, and some good fictional ones as well.
I particularly appreciated the author's characterization of Sir Thomas More, a character who shows up a quite a lot in the story.
I would recommend this for any reader interested in the religious upheaval wrought by Henry the VIII. For others, this might lose interest.

As usual, Melissa Marr's writing delivers. I love the Wicked Lovely series, and this latest book is wonderful as well.
It took me a few chapters to get a foothold on the characters and continueing storyline as it's been a long time since I read the preceding books ""Wicked Lovely"" and ""Ink Exchange"" - but once I got everything figured out, this book was very enjoyable.
Marr's particular take on the politics of Fairy are intrigueing, and have definitely influenced my own thinking on the subject already. Following Seth's journey along with Aislinn's was a nice change, though his choices and the resultant ending left me unsatisfied. That said, my dissatisfaction simply guarantees that I'll be purchasing Marr's next entry in the series as soon as it comes out. She's good. Dangit.

My rating: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/36669196"">3 of 5 stars</a>
I very much enjoyed this entry in Melling's Chronicles of Faerie series, though without a romantic interest, I'll admit I didn't love it quite as much as her others. Yeah, I'm a sucker for the romance.
That said, I still adore her take on the Fae of Ireland, and her representation of the little people and their various homes. I LOVE how varied she keeps her cast of characters. Granted, there are a lot of variations on the Fae out there to work with, but so many authors forget that. But not Melling. She makes use of so many, from the most well known to the most obscure.
The particularly unique thing about this book is the environmental aspect. It is quite clear from the beginning that conservation of Ireland's nature will play a big role in the story. And it's beautiful. A wonderful way to demonstrate the power of the land, and its importance to us. And, in a roundabout way, the importance of us to nature. I like that a lot. 
One more cool factor: Melling isn't afraid to sprinkle Irish Gaelic liberally into the narrative. And a glossary is always provided in each book. Now I want to learn Gaelic...

I didn't read this book cover to cover - I didn't need to - but I did read a good 75% of it. All in all, it's a good reference book. I really appreciate how the jobs are presented. The author gives basic explanations, examples, and also interviews someone from that profession (i.e. John Lithgow for Actor). Results vary, but for the most part you end up with a pretty good idea on the function of that person in the film making process.
Side note: The job titles in Hollywood are so very, very fluid in description. The author does his best to explain that, though it can at times be frustrating. No fault to the author, though.
The downside with this book is that it's a bit dated. Although it does include updated chapters on digital animation and effects, it doesn't mention digital filming, which is still a new process.
That said, the principles of filming and such are pretty much the same, so it's not a huge loss.
Like I said - good reference book, and probably one I'll end up buying for my very own self.

This was a really fun book that made me groan delightedly at the absolutely skewed vision of Alaska from an Outsider's point of view.
While I'm sure the author did research into Alaska living, there's no replacing an actual visit...and it's pretty clear that she watched Northern Exposure for reference material.
That said, the story is delightfully silly. It's somewhat ridiculous, and a little bit melodramatic - and at times, sizzling. And to be quite honest, I got a kick out of how off she was on so many things. We Alaskans love to be snobs - who doesn't? - but some of us also have a sense of humor. And if you have one too, you'll probably enjoy this book.
Just don't use it for Alaskan research.

Dear me, I seem to have read the most recent Cal Leandros book. Now I have to wait for months for the next one. Excuse me while I wail in misery.
...
This one? This one was amazing. They keep getting better.
Oddly enough, this book had a bit of a shaky start. Thurman has always told the story through Cal's eyes. But in this one things switch up a bit, and the narrator alternates between Cal and his brother Niko. At first I was a bit worried it wouldn't work - Niko's first chapter is pretty much him listening in to one of Cal's conversations. 
But as the story moves on, Niko's character fleshes out wonderfully, and the dual narration takes the series to a whole new level. By the end of the book, you are more aware of their relationship and brotherly devotion than ever before. Everything matters that much more.
Also, can you say PLOT TWIST? Holy carp Batman.
So yeah. GOOD STUFF.

It took me a few more pages than usual to get into this novel - though I imagine, had I been male, this would not be the case. You see, the pace of this book didn't seem to really pick up for me until after the first hundred pages or so. It wasn't dull or anything - there were some very good action sequences, and more than enough mystery thrown in right away. No, the reason it took those hundred pages for me to really get into this novel was the simple fact that it took the story that long to introduce the character with whom the protagonist would feel romantic tension.
There - proof I'm female.
What started as a read like any other ended in a fascinating look at how men and women approach stories so differently. This author gets my kudos for managing to write something that, I think, appeals to both genders.
There's plenty of action and fast paced movement for the guys, and just enough sexual and romantic tension to keep things interesting for the girls.
If it weren't for this delicate balance, I'd say this book is rather like the dozens of other paranormal hunter-type books out there. Nothing particularly original, although the descriptions and names for such recognized creatures as werewolves and vampires are changed and mixed up a bit. But the characters are multi-taskers - keeping both sides of the audience appeased, and that is something I definitely appreciate.
So when the sequel comes out, I'll probably pick it up. As entertainment goes, this book satisfied.

Well, it's official: I love the Cal Leandros Series. I really do. With an ever-expanding cast of bad guys from the world of monsters, I love that Rob Thurman goes above and beyond the vampires/werewolf/demon thing and even expands on those classic figures of paranormal fiction.
But most of all? Most of all, I love Cal. As the narrative voice in the series, that's a pretty important thing. He has a wonderfully gritty, snarky way of thinking, angsty and self-aware. I've gone on about it in my reviews of ""Nightlife"" (book 1) and ""Moonshine"" (book 2), so I'll curb my fangirling on this review as best I can.
Although not quite a mystery series - we usually know the bad guy pretty quickly - there is that sense of anticipation, even so. Knowing the baddy is one thing - catching and killing it is another thing entirely. And throughout it all, the character growth is very realistic. Not too fast, but there, ever changing.
In each book, the supporting casts' roles have ever increased, and this one is no different, happily. And it's a wonderful supporting cast - a Puck secretly in search of redemption? Oh yes. And don't forget the monosyllabic but still quite alluring werewolf Delilah that shows up in this book. Although it sounds silly - and at times it is fun - the story draws you in, and it doesn't stay silly. 
Sure there are some laughs - enough to keep the reader from wearing out too soon - but there are no lags, and this is not a comedy.
By the end of the book, I was a little breathless from holding my breath so many times in anticipation - no joke. And then? Then, Thurman delivers the final blow.

Ah, a good, cliche, romance novel. Sometimes it's just what a girl needs. Don't argue, it's true. And this one certainly fits the bill.
It's historical - accurate enough to get clothing pieces named correctly, and enough of the dialect down to be believably antique - which I appreciate.
So let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Yes, it's formulaic. Yes, yes, I know, I know, it has a half naked man on the cover. But let's face it girls, we don't get that kind of romance very often in the real world, right? And this one - THIS one actually has a story in it. Matter fact - for a bodice-ripping style marketing approach, there was actually only one scene with bodice ripping in it - and it isn't even the scene you think it is!
I have only one complaint (which I will, of course, address now). The author makes a little too much use of the triple dots of doom. You know, that dot dot dot that breaks up a phrase? But it's not too hard to get past that, and after that, it's a reasonably well done story.
Bottom line: I liked the characters, the story had me appropriately enthralled, and the ending was satisfying. A good read.

As a separate entity, this book is a fun romp and an enjoyable read. Of course, it isn't a separate entity - it's part of a series. So naturally I'm going to compare it to all of the prior books, and when I do that, it tends to droop a bit.
Yes, it's fun, and made me laugh. But it was missing something - something that's been progressively disappearing from the Stephanie Plum books over the years. Suspense. Tension. The edge-of-your-seat urge to speed read.
Where'd it go? Yes, the cars still get blown up and there are guns and all that jazz, but we don't actually fear for Stephanie's life anymore, do we?  While that's great for Miss Plum, it kind of sucks for us readers. Well, at least this reader.
I'm sure there is a wide audience out there who appreciates the shift as much or more as I don't. But I miss the edge.
I'll still get sixteen whenever that pops up, as I'm sure it will. But do me a favor? Pull back on the slapstick a bit, and push the scary. These ARE supposed to be mysteries, remember.

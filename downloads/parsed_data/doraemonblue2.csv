"event","i am having serious hormonal issues... crying over no reason at all...ok, so not no reason, but just it seems like overly sensitive today.

the bottom line is that I am crying because i feel put down when my words have no say in the company because eric will just over-ride what i say. 

the latest example: my client had wanted 3 samples of a specific item.  He specifically called me to say he wanted 3.  So that day when i spoke to my factory, I asked the girl to ship 3, the customer wanted 3, please ship 3.  later i found out eric sent one due to the high cost in shipping.

ok so you say, it's not a big deal.  why are you crying over that?  because i don't know how to face my client after eric defends why he should not give into the 3 demands that my client had asked for.  

1. the stickers to be vinyl stickers / the defense: we have a lot of stock unuseable stickers, it's an extra cost to switch it up, plus we are not making any money in the items we sell him.

2. sending samples & product confirmation, don't skimp on shipping for those items /  the defense, those shipping costs are not factored into the product cost, so i have to be stingy about shipping.

3. product thickness has to be what is ordered / the items are quoted according to the samples you provided which is the thickness we're making.

yes these are all ok answers, but these ok answers is not sugar coated answer which will make the client be warm and fuzzy and happy.  these ok answers will piss off the client, and possibly alienate him, and make him take his business elsewhere, cuz that's what i would do.

well i did my part by telling you what the client wants, and if you don't listen to what the client wants, i can not be held responsible for losing the client.

I am done crying... thus i am done venting."

"event","i think that being unpopularity opinioned about things is just maybe something that one should keep quiet about... or just be opinionated to your close friends who know you better than just those opinions.

from an outside point of view, yes, saying outloud that i think the mainland people don't deserve human rights is really harsh.  It was a mere reaction to another person saying, support human rights, boycott china.  Seriously though, if one was to boycott china, you'd have to be living in the dark ages these days.  It's not as easy to boycott ALL made in China things I feel... perhaps you only wear made in the US items, but how do you really know that the fabric that they purchased were not made in China, and just sewn together in the US.

le sigh.  I should just keep those contriversial opinions to myself.  maybe what i said was really harsh, but it's one of my irks about living in china.  the fact that these people do not watch where they are walking when there are cars around, or the way that they cut in line when you are patiently waiting for the check out line, etc. or the fact that your wife will run away with the workers' paycheck after 10 years of marriage, leaving a note saying, that she has been waiting for this day for the longest time.  It's stories like that, that i feel like the improvements in China since the whole business bombardment has not really done them a dis-service.  Yes, they are no longer hungry, and fighting to just survive, but they are very still caveman like.  New Money and Old money I guess.  Maybe it's not the same thing, but having money does not buy you taste... so my reasoning is that having these rights does not buy you manners."

"event","i am a knitting girl.  I am on my third project...a scarf for fill.  It's gray & grayer.  It looks to be a good male scarf.  I hope to finish it soon, so that I may start on a new scarf for other people and try out new patterns.  I'm making fill's scarf in a striped garter stitch...simple, but time consuming at the same time.

I knit in half an hour incriments...after the half hour, I have to be really focused to knit further.  Usually I take a break, and look at patterns.

I am thinking of making scarves for everyone...

10 reasons to knit a scarf:

1.  everybody needs one.
2.  scarves are varied in technical difficulty.
3.  a scarf is always a welcome gift.
4.  there is comfort knitting, mindless rows is good for those days when anything more complex would make you cry.
5.  how could a scarf not fit??
6.  you can always use one more scarf.
7.  keeps all your heat from escaping from your body.
8.  scarves are easy.
9.  you can rob a bank with it!!!
10.  lastly...because your friend will have a piece of you with them all the time."

Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

[Bridge]

I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Chorus]

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss and we make up on the way

[Bridge]

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave,
maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know baby youuuu and I

I suppose i should take it from Maria...""when one door closes somewhere a window is open.""  and look where it got her, a marriage from a really good looking guy, and ready-made kids.  

i've been doing some crafts lately...rings and what not.  i like it.  i like to make things.  i'm not all that creative, i steal ideas from other people, and make them.  i do that best.  anyway...hoping to visit the craft store on friday...when i pick up my passport.

"event","it's odd that i always seem to check this once in awhile, and once in awhile you submit an entry...it's weird how those times seem to just be near each other.  it's like we're real friends or something.

i want to come back...deep down i know i do, but i'm giving this a try.  i want to be with my parents, i've missed out on majority of their lives, and it's time that they start nagging at me at least within the same time zone.  

I've missed out on their lives, and they've missed out on mine...such the life of a ""me.""

and i will also be sad if i lost them...they aren't getting any younger, and isn't it time i give back 200 % of what they've given me?

yes, it's time...

time for change...

let's be brave and not scared.

i will not let fear hold me back!

we will be okay."

"event","sometimes i want to say things, but when the moments pass, i don't feel it anymore.  

sometimes when i'm upset and want to destroy things, and i get away then all of a sudden i think to myself is this really how i want it to be?  be mad at him...i did say that i want to go home, so why should i expect him to stay with me, or express that he wants me to stay...if i wanted to stay with him, then i should just say so, but because i don't say so i have no right.  

like today when i drove away all mad because he didn't understand why...and told me not to be mad...it just makes me more upset...but then after i drove home for awhile, a fill thought cheered me up, and made me realise that i wasn't mad at him anymore, just a random fill thought.  

i thought of starting a new town of animal crossing call, fill up, and when fill would play he would get that really big dorky smile, and be super happy.  and just thinking of his happy smile made me not mad anyone...and so i called him and to tell him that i wasn't mad, and that he should enjoy his fun with his friends.

he's allowed to have a life outside of me...i shouldn't be mad at that...that's just lame.  and i don't want to be lame.

even though he has no money, he still buys me presents, and spends the whole day with me.  he lounges around with me, he goes to eat furaibo with me all the time...

he likes me a lot.  

i am really growing up and being mature...working out my own problems."

"event","maybe u should just defend him.

just let her know how happy you are and i think she will be more understanding. tell her how great he is, because i'm sure when he's around other people, he seems all shy.  and explain you're young and you realize that you don't know if this is necessarily going to lead to marriage, but you know that you are happy for now. and this is still a new relationship, so let things ride on their own. maybe if you tell her that her saying things makes you want to do things to spite her.
 
 yes mothers.. asian mothers are difficult. and the hardest thing of all, is that even though we dont want to care what our parents think, we do."

"event","I realised this about myself right now...

1. I no longer have a need to talk incessively on the phone with fill...actually I don't like talking much on the phone period...unless I have an issue I need to work out, I don't pick up the phone to call...i've resorted to text messages, AIM & other forms of communications...i.e. email.  I've this person who lacks voice to voice contact...and prefer it that way...i'm not sure how I feel about that right now.

2.  Although i'm disappointed that I didn't see fill today, I wanted to, it was okay not seeing him.  I puttered around the house, read magazines, and put away a few items...I didn't get mad at him for being busy.  It was in the way that he was like, well i'm going down to south coast, and then dinner that made me realise that it was going to be too late for me for him to come over to see me...and well it was okay, i didn't make a big deal of it....which is odd because i would usually expect to see him, and make a huge fucking deal over it, and make him feel bad...but today i'm just okay with not seeing him...okay i'll stop repeating the same thing.

3.  this realisation is about fill & I:  we both have motorcycle helmets, but no bike.  HAHA...

4.  My sister just suggested that maybe i write down everything I spend to keep track of what i spend my money on...how smart is she?  I mean other people have said this to me, but having her say it across the seas makes me realise again that perhaps I should start doing that again...where do I spend all my money??

okay so, today I spent: $55 - dr. fees @ Kaiser, $6.00 - snacks (fishy things) = $61.00"

"event","well heres another one. So this is the first time I am updating in a very long time. So, obviously you all know why I'm doing it. I recently just got over one tough rejection, and no more than a month later. BOOM, another one right in my face. I really liked this girl, and to hear her say that was like a dagger in my heart. It really sucked. Lee you were right. I don't know what made me think she liked me. She likes someone else in another grade. That really sucked. A lot. Well that's two fish down, another 6 billion to go or so. Jeez. I hate when this happens. lemme know what you think, or leave some advice."

Thats how I feel right now. My weekend started out a wild ride going to the Pep Rally. The day after, it was the big game. Up until then I was having possibly one of the best weekends of my life. I can't believe that I could love someone that much, and not have it returned. I now realize, that for the past two years of my life, I was living in a dream world. Clinging to dreams like frost to a flower's petal. I wish none of this had happened, but I can't chnage the fact. Anna does not have any feelings for me. I think that she still wants to be friends, but I can't. Everyone says that I should just put her out of my head, and look for someone else. I dont even know who to look at. I was watching tv last night, and heard the name Anna, and started to cry. Today, I don't even remember what morning classes I had. I was just wishing that things were different. And we lost to Irvington. I feel like dying. Or listen to this song over again and again. PLz let me lean on your shoulder. Someone. Anyone."

I opened my ""heart"" to so many people asking for advice and help. Unexpectdly i got it. Ok, if u missed it once then here it is again, I asked anna out. I don't know what made me do it, but i guess it was after two years, of doing nothing, i needed to act. Undoubtedly, news of this will spread throughout the school. And hopefully, i wont be burned at the stake by my friends. Ok! So homecoming was great, we won, It was great, i didnt fall down the bleacherS! Joel was pumping it up, and we all got soaked. Just standing out there in that rain, cheering my ass off was the best thing that happened to me all weekend."

"event","alright, so spirit week is over, and the pep rally was great. However, i got somethings bothering me. Ok, now if anyone reads this, dont laugh. I think for the first time in my life I really like somebody. ONly thing is one of my good friends likes her too. Someone plz try and give me a good way of approaching her, and or talking to her. Big secret to all, im not assertive, and really quite shy. I might act like a bigshot or idiot sometimes in school, but I do cause im pretty sure that I'll just fade into the background, and not make a name for myself. I really like this girl, and she makes me smile. Something I have needed since my accident. I lose sleep alot over this, not knowing wheter I should tell her how I feel, and risk getting burned, or having the feelings returned, but getting joked on by my friends. I dont now what to so. Help if anyone is out there."

"event","The return of Anand was short lived. I went to school and was having a *blast*. Mrs. Santare sounds like Whitey from 8 crazy nights, Mr Calvi, *stamps* his foot like every 3 seconds, Mrs Oettinger gave me an A on my first quiz, and Mr. Delle Bovi is crazy. But alls fair in war. After i got out early to get my fifth cast wrapped, i caught a cold. Lucky me. A gimp, and a snivelly sick little boy. Anyway, the guy who wrapped my cast was a guy called ""Booker"" (Two guys were working there, and my mom goes to this enormous black guy, ""Are you Booker or Jose?"" he goes, ""do i look like a Booker or a Jose?"" it was pretty funny. He was cool though, he tried out for the Jets, Giants, and Falcons in the 80's as runnning back, but got beat out in the final round. He also gave me advice. Don't go easy on little people. Pads are supposed to protect you so basically just hit them like ur hitting someone ur own size. I've met some pretty cool people along the way."

"event","Ok, so in a statement saying that I need to update more, OK here, im updating. So today is the big game and i'm finally gonna be doing something cool. Hopefully I can hang out with people before the game. A lot has happened this week.
Monday jackshit happened. 

Tuesday alot happened. I went to the doctors and got recasted. But it was a lot more exciting than that. I got recasted, and the doctors thought that i had a potentially fatal bloodclot in my leg. However after having an ultrasound or something like that, they found out i didnt. It's really quite funny to hear your blood flow in your body. OK, so i got recasted, and went home, bought the Star Wars trilogy and watched it while eating taco bell. mmm.

Wednesday, i dont remember.

Thusday, i went to the movies. I saw skycaptain, with my mom and was pleasantly surprised. Those handicap seats are quite comfortable. Only thing is that old people and handicaps go during the day. Its rather depressing.

Friday, i went to Kohls to buy a big pair of sweats, and got my glasses fixed at the eye place. Then i went to B&N read, then went to chinese restaurant for lunch. 

Saturday, I got up and did homework all day. Then i rented Soul plane, and was gonna watch it with Peter and Danny, but instead we played Madden and ate cookies.mmm.

I dont know what happened today yet. Gosh!"

He says that im not trying hard enough and says all this real nasty shit to me in front of my family. jeez, i felt like a real piece of shit. Anyway, my mom and sis keep saying that its not my fault, and i wish i could believe them. Since my break, my only friends who have come and visited me are Pat, Peter, and Fanelli. Thnz alot guys. As for you other smucks, go die. Not the guys on my ffotball team though, they sent me the gameball signed. Also Mrs. Santare is nice. She sent me two cards so far.
Well what is a person in my situation to do. I really dont know, maybe i will go and sleep it off, watch tv or play PS2, but wait, thats all i can do. Besides walking around the house in a fuckin circle all the time to ""build up my stamina."" Only thing is it is kinda hard with this cast. It weighs like 35 lbs and looks like it was wrapped by a fuckin blind man. oh man..."

"event","Wow so much has happened in the last week or so. So my summer was going pretty good, i was working out at the gym, going to triples, and just chillin. So one day when we are at a regular football practice, my life gets turned upside down. I think that it was Sirus, but i dont really blame him, somehow managed to fracture my femur in two or three places. Now a week later, I am out for the entire season, missing at least a mont of school school, have a giant cast on my leg, and am going for surgery. Sometimes I wondered why this has happened to me, my mom says its a test of my faith, but i dont believe that. All I want to do is to go back to school, which sounds really weird, but is true. Can you imagine being stuck in your house with no one to talk to except your parents, and not being able to change yourself or even walking around the house without pain? Well I know what its like. Wow if anyone reads this can you tell how bored i am. I never write in this. I'm just wondering, why?"

46: Sheng / Pushing Upward
  Pushing Upward has supreme success.
  One must see the great man.
  Fear not.
  Departure toward the south
  Brings good fortune

Six in the fifth place means:
  Perseverance brings good fortune.
  One pushes upward by steps.

48. Ching / The Well
  The town may be changed,
  But the well cannot be changed.
  It neither decreases nor increases.
  They come and go and draw from the well.
  If one gets down almost to the water
  And if the rope does not go all the way,
  Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.

  Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,
  And exhorts them to help one another. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"

sharpcast is in alpha right now, and is looking like it'll be a good program, it's easy enough to use, at least, and doesn't take forever to upload.

anyway, i've put up random pictures just because i can:

"event","I went sailing yesterday, as i do on wednesdays, and actually saw dolphins this time!!  as anyone who has known me for a while should know, i spent a good many years obcessed with dolphins.  I'm not quite as obcessed as i used to be, but i still like them. (read this as - yes i like to see them, no don't get me any more, i'm starting to get a dolphin stuff overdose)

Anyway, i've been sailing many times, and this is only the second time i've seen them, and the first time they have been this close to the boat! it was awesome.

sailing was also amusing as a statement on the stupidity of people.  It will always amaze me how stupid people are, and how they can turn the simplest thing into a tredgedy.  When we are done sailing, we lower the main sail, and fold it back and forth over the boom.  This is not all that complicated.  However, we had a couple people on the boat who insisted on helping, and were doing nothing but cause a disaster.  When we docked, and they got off the boat, my dad and i had to fix it...  Being at berkeley has gotten me used to a certain level of intelegence... though even here i'm surprised at some people - book smarts they have, but not much else... *sigh*"

""One, two, three, f-- kuso!""

""I believe that's one of my railroads,"" Quatre informed him. ""That'll be--""

""Objection!""

""--eh?"" Blinking, Quatre turned to look at Duo.

""I object!"" Duo repeated, drawing himself up. ""In fact, I do more than object, I'm calling for an investigation by the Consumer Protection Agency, and it's my belief that they'll find you guilty of price-fixing and having an illegal monopoly on essential goods and services. You're in trouble now!""

""Duo, what are you talking about?!"" Quatre protested, laughing. ""This game is called Monopoly, for goodness' sake!""

""Not any more it's not! That's an outmoded capitalist concept, that is, totally inappropriate in today's enlightened society. You're a bloated plutocrat grinding the faces of the proletariat, you are! I insist that you divest yourself of some of your holdings. In fact, just to be safe, you should divest yourself of most of 'em."" Duo grinned. ""New house rule. The person who spends the most time in jail at the start of the game is therefore proven to be a politician, and gets to mold society. That would be me... so we're communist now, we are. Welcome to the New Era, comrades!""

""Sounds good to me,"" Heero grinned back, noting the renewed sparkle in Duo's eyes. ""Got a red flag I can raise?""

""Don't I get any say in this?"" the blond asked plaintively.

""No! Be grateful you're not facing a firing squad!""

""Does that make me a capitalist running dog lackey of the system too?"" Trowa enquired. ""I am using the scottie dog, you know.""

""Oh, you're only a minor parasite,"" Duo informed him as he started 'confiscating' Quatre's properties and returning them to the bank. ""You can probably repay your debt to society by turning some of your lands over to the People to be converted into low-rent housing for underprivileged families. Of course, that'll lower property values in the neighbourhood -- pity all the rest of your land is in the same place, isn't it? Still, it's not as if anyone really needs to make a profit here in the United Gundam Socialist Republics!"""

"event","Partying with the kendo group is AWESOME!!

it was the last day for one of the members, so we all went out to dinner and then went back to someone's house to drink.

i'm actually aquiring a taste for beer, who knew?!

anyway, we played a few drinking games that must be recoreded for posterity, and i must learn the game 'fuck shit bunny' so that i can teach it to them - get a 'white' game to mix in with the korean/japanese ones :P

the first one was watermellon
we didn't play this long, but basically you point left, right, or up, then whoever is left or right of you gets to pick a direction.  the fun part is if you point up, then whoever would have been next in the original direction of play is skipped.  when there are a lot of skips, it gets extreemly confusing

second was three-six-nine (though they said them in korean, and i don't remember what they were)
for this one, we go around in a circle and each person says the number one higher than the previous person.  you start at one and go untill someone messes up.  the catch?  for the numbers three, six, and nine, you have to clap.  sounds easy right? well, this continues so that 13, 16, and 19 are also claps, but in addition, any factor of three is also a clap- thus after ten, claps are for 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, etc...  i don't think our group got past 25 without someone making a mistake.  this is another game we didn't play for too long

the third game was 'baskin robbins 31' (which was said with a weird asian accent that took me a few mins to figure out... it couldn't have been the beer...).  for this one, you start at the number one, then work up untill you get to the number 31, at which point whoever says 31 has to drink.  the trick here is each person can say up to three numbers of the sequence, so when you get around 25, you can almost choose who you want to drink... (ex, each comma will be a different person: 1 2 3, 4 5, 6 7, 8, 9 10 11, 12 13 14, etc)  this lasted a few rounds

the game we spent the most time playing was dippy-dippy-dip (or ultra man).  what amused me is that i played a game with the same name with the mormon band peeps at the bowl game... suffice to say, this game was a bit different.  for this you choolse three different hand signals that can be used.  whoever's turn it is says 'dippy dippy dip' and on the 'dip' everyone at the table makes one of the hand signals.  whoever matches the person who's turn it is has to drink.  the signals start off rather easy. then after everyone has had a turn to be 'it', the signals change, one at a time, every few turns.  in addition to matching the caller, if you do a signal wrong, you also have to drink, and when the signals keep changing, this is easy to do.  we spent a lot of time playing this one.

it was a blast - i just wish i didn't have to drive someone home, otherwise i would have stayed a lot later.  the only disadvantage is that i think i can hold my drinks better than anyone else there - it's odd being the only white person in the group - but then again, it was still a lot of fun, so i can't really complain."

"event","In my random wanderings of the net, i came across a site for Bored of the Rings, and saw that they had excerpts.  since i happen to really like the prologue, i put it down here.  it's funny, and if you like the books (or don't like the books) you will still find this amusing, as long as you have read the hobbit.

<lj-cut text=""Of the finding of the ring"">
...As is told in the volume previous to this hound, Valley of the Trolls, Dildo Bugger set out one day with a band of demented dwarves and a discredited Rosicrucian named Goodgulf to separate a dragon from his hoard of short-term municipals and convertible debentures. The quest was successful, and the dragon, a prewar basilisk who smelled like a bus, was taken from behind while he was clipping coupons. And yet, though many pointless and annoying deeds were done, this adventure would concern us a good deal less than it does, if that is possible, except for a bit of petty larceny Dildo did along the way to keep his hand in...


...When Dildo's eyes became adjusted to the pale light, he found that the grotto was almost filled by a wide, kidney-shaped lake where a nasty-looking clown named Goddam paddled noisily about on an old rubber sea horse. He ate raw fish and occasional side orders to travel from the outside world in the form of lost travelers like Dildo, and he greeted Dildo's unexpected entrance into his underground sauna in much the same way as he would the sudden arrival of a Chicken Delight truck. But like anyone with boggie ancestry, Goddam preferred the subtle approach in assaulting creatures over five inches high and weighing more than ten pounds, and consequently he challenged Dildo to a riddle game to gain time. Dildo, who had a sudden attack of amnesia regarding the fact that the dwarves were being made into chutney outside the cave, accepted...


...Stumped at last for a riddle to ask, he cried out. as his hand fell on his snub-nosed .38, ""What have I got in my pocket?"" This Goddam failed to answer, and growing impatient, he paddled up to Dildo, whining, ""Let me see, let me see."" Dildo obliged by pulling out the pistol and emptying it in Goddam's direction. The dark spoiled his aim, and he managed only to deflate the rubber boat, leaving Goddam to flounder. Goddam, who couldn't swim, reached out his hand to Dildo and begged him to pull him out, and, as he did, Dildo noticed an interesting looking ring on his finger and pulled it off. He would have finished Goddam off then and there, but pity stayed his hand. It's a pity I've run out of bullets, he thought as he went back up the tunnel, pursued by Goddam's cries of rage...

"event","so the dvd's i got my mom for christmass were also gotten for her from other members of the family, so i offered to just return them and then have some different dvd's sent to her.  seems easy enough, right?  well i went to bn and even though i had the recipt and the dvd's were un opened, since it was past 14 days they could only give me store credit.  that wasn't so bad, i was just planning on buying the new dvd's so i could do it from them just as easily as anyone else.  then i go to use the card online, and it doesn't work.  the fucking store credit card only workes in the stores.  and of course, there isn't free shipping from the store, or the same prices, or anything like that... GRRRRR.  so now i just have a store credit for bn because it's just easier to pay off my credit card online and have it off and sent, and just wait till i need to buy something else at bn... or if worst comes to worst, it's an excuse for me to go buy myself some new books... 

stupid store policies... at least when i worked at pier one, we didn't do crap like that, or if we did, there are great tricks that employies can do to get around stuff like that... GRRRRR

oh well, such is life.

"event","so i'm just wasting time on the internet, as usual, and i decided to google 'l33t'

now that got some amusing results - it's fun to see what different people are saying about l33t, and the fact that they have lists of words and definitions... it just amused me

but the best part, and the reason that i love google, is that one of the 'languages' that google is in IS l33t

"event","i've been in this apartment for over a year, and yet very rarly cooked anything... most the time i was too lazy, or too poor, so that's not my fault.  however another reason is that i don't want to mess up infront of someone - ie eunice.  it's not a huge fear, but it keeps me to cooking things i've made before so that i don't 1- waste food and money or 2 make myself look stupid.  now that there isn't anyone here, i'm all over cooking! it's awesome, because things are turning out well.  

tonight i made spagetti sauce for the first time.  ok, this isn't a terribly hard thing to do - brown the ground beef, chop some onions, add the tomato sauce, add some seasonings... but it was still awesome!  we had a little dinner party and it was great!  to accompany the spagetti was garlic bread... not just any garlic bread though.  this was a fresh loaf of french bread with an entire head of garlic (is that what all the cloves together is called?) and a ton of butter on it.  oh my god.  i didn't think that there could be garlic bread with that much garlic, but it was amazing and oh so wonderfull... i think i am now a better person for having experienced it.

and to wrap up the evening - i fixed my toilet after SOMEONE broke it... sheesh, that's what i get for having peopole over i guess! actually, i blame eunice.  she set the entire apartment to explode after she left, i'm sure of it x.x  if this place goes up in a puff of smoke, you will all know why..."

I watched speed tonight.  great movie, a classic, one i grew up on.  it's kinda predictable, but it's an action movie, so there is only so much you can do.  however, they do try to keep a sense of suspence.  however, the idiots who planned this dvd on tv thing should be shot.  the buss is driving along safely on the freeway - cut to comercial break - cut to dvd on tv bit where they show the awesome effects of the buss jumping over the gap in the freeway and landing on the other side. wait a second.  the movie hasn't gotten that far yet... we don't even know that there is a gap!!  they do this throught the movie - any potentially stressfull ""omg, are they going to make it?!?!"" part is preceded by the special features that tell you what's going to happen.  it took all the fun out of the movie!  i couldn't even stay and watch the end of it... although that had a bit more to do with the huge ass spider that was stalking me... he kept getting closer and closer... i know he was about to jump up on the sofa and attack, i know it..."

"event","of course, as fate would have it, right after i get my new fish my tank decides to do whatever it can to anger me - today to take a break from homework, i decided to test the water quality of the tank.  ph was fine, nitrates a little high, but nitrites are fine.. then i get to ammonia.  if you don't know, ammonia kills fish.  it kills them dead.  very quickly. ammonia is bad.  so i do that test.  the tube is supposed to be yellow for no ammonia, then if there is any it turns green.  the test is supposed to take five minutes.  the second i added the solution, it went past yellow and into green.  immediatly... dark dark green... AHHHHH.  so i immediatly called my boss and begged her to let me come in late so i could rescue my fish. so now they are all happy again (hopefully x.x) while the stuff i added attacks the ammonia.  silly fish and their silly controlled environment that is so tempramental... now if they would just let me have a cat, this wouldn't be such an issue - so much easier and better a cat would be... *sigh*"

yay, i act my age!!! - only because i'm either being really mature or acting like i'm four... not sure i ever actually act twenty... 

for example, i present my day: made mini pancakes that i ate with my hands, moved my furniture from my room to eunice's room, played video games, and cleaned my fish tank.  poor fish haven't had a nice cleaning in a while... now i have to figure out where to put it... dillema dillema...

but yay, my landlord finally admitted that i was right about him having to rewire my phone jacks, so he's having the company come out and do that, and while he was here he realized that i was NOT exagerating about the puddle that my hallway has become and tomorrow he's having people come out and clean and dry it out ^_^  only bad thing is that it'll be at 9 in the morning, and i don't have class till ten x.x

*sigh* must get back to my fish tank, need to decide how i want it to look :P  weee playing with rocks and plants and stuff!!"

"event","i made the mistake of looking at the north star website today.  lift tickets are $63... but a season pass is only $269... that means if i go for five days, it's all free after that... however there is the whole issue of lodging.. though moosa's boyfriend does have a cabin... not sure how often i can make use of that, nor am i sure of where it is and which resort it is by... ug, so many things to consider... not that i can really afford to buy the season pass and pay for the gass it takes to get up there.. but still... *sigh* i really want to go skiing!!  i think i first need to figure out if i can get chains on my car... technically saturn's can't take chains and therefore have to get spike spiders.  spike spiders are god's gift to chain users, because they are the most glorious things to put on and take off of a car.  it's wonderfull, you pull over to the side of the road where everone is struggling with chains, pop them on while everyone glares, then drive off three minutes later.  it's awesome!  the downside? because you know there has to be one, is that they are EXPENSIVE!! i don't remember how much they are, but i know it's a lot.

*sigh* why do i ahve to have such expensive hobbies? why am i not rich? why haven't i won the lottery?! who cares if i don't buy tickets, everyone knows that i should win it anyway!! 

i'm going to go drool over some skii pictures now"

"event","well, last night i went down to san jose to get some stuff from my dad for my now empty apartment.  it was so weird.  going through drawers and cabinets in the kitchen pulling out stuff that has always been dad's and thinking ""it's all mine now... dude!!"".  it was crazy.  after i got the pots and pans and all that kind of stuff, i moved his entire spice cabinet into a box, because it's all mine too!  i have tons of spagetti that was there, boxes of rice a roni, pancake mix, pam, canned food, salt, and other random things that my dad has.  i sware, i'm not going to have to go to the grocerie store for another couple years!  what's crazy is i still have to go through the rest of the house and get furniture and stuff... since my dad is renting the place out, it's all got to go... i'm even going to get his christmass decorations, because his girlfriend has her own, and i would like, die if we lost sof of the weird random crap that we have.... it's all so strange... when mom moved, we had to go through the whole 'what do you want to keep' thing, so this is kinda like that, but she was still keeping her stuff, just moving some of it somewhere else.  now, if i don't take it, it's just gone... so sad.  i'm loosing my other home! now i really have nowhere to go back to! well.. ok, i kinda lived at rita's house at one point in time, so that's kinda a home, and i'm always welcom at nikki's house... but both MY houses will be gone... *sigh*... oh well, at least i get an entirly stocked kitchen, furniture, and a huge tv!"

my costume is one that lindsay wore eons ago - a black velvet dress with fun long sleves and relativly low cut, then some funky jewelry and fun makeup and it was cool... i think i was some kind of random hippi witch or something... not entirly sure... but it was fun anyway.

here's a llama
there's a llama
and another little llama
fuzzy llama
funny llama
llama llama
duck

llama llama
cheesecake
llama
tablet
brick
potato
llama
llama llama
mushroom
llama
llama llama
duck

i was once a treehouse
i lived in a cake
but i never saw the way
the orange slayed the rake
i was only three years dead
but it told a tale
and now listen, little child
to the safety rail

did you ever see a llama
kiss a llama
on the llama
llama's llama
tastes of llama
llama llama
duck

half a llama
twice the llama
not a llama
farmer
llama
llama in a car
alarm a llama
llama
duck

is THIS how it's told now?
is it all so old?
is it made of lemon juice?
doorknob
ankle
cold
now my song is getting thin
i've run out of luck
time for me to retire now
and become a duck"

"event","so i was flipping channels this morning, and came across a bunch of girls on stage playing chinese instruments.  first it was just weird, because the only time i have ever really heard one of the instruments (that stringed thing with only a few strings played with a bow - don't know what it's called..) is from random people playing it on campus or in china town.  well, usually it sounds like shit, but here, it sounded really good.  they also had a few different types of plucked string instruments, some hammered string instruments, and a couple flutes.  It definatly sounded chinese, but not quite... it was really good! not the sort of thing you can mosh to or anything, but really good in the classical music sence, only it's not quite classical... it was just weird!  one thing that was rather interesting is that they had two floutists, both playing the same kind of chinese flute, and one was holding it backwards.  now i guess this works for those flutes, since they don't have keys, just open holes, but it was really weird to see... anyway, after about five of their songs, i realized i'd been sitting there listining for like, 30 mins... i love getting sucked into music like that, it was so cool!! omg.  so yeah, after that time there name was finally put up: twelve girls band. so of course i googled them, found em (http://www.twelvegirlsband.com/main.htm) and also found out that they are playing in san francisco next wednesday... don't think i'll be going though, since the cheapest seats are more that $50 x.x  oh well, they have a ton of cd's so perhaps i'll grab one of those... or just see what the internet can provde ^_^;

an interesting way to start the day, that's for sure."

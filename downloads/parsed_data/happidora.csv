"event","i woke up yesterday, super excited to be voting in person for the first time. it was such a short process but i honestly felt like i made a difference.

and last night? that was amazing. it was definitely history in the making.

i'm so mad i missed most of the process cuz of class, but i was able to make it home to watch the last half of PRESIDENT Obama's speech. it was moving and inspiring. i love how he emulated MLK's ""I Have A Dream"" speech.

and even though I didn't watch McCain's entire speech, from the clips that i saw, it was very dignified, gracious, and patriotic. 

it was so moving to watch Obama's speech because i sat there, thinking about my future.

when i'm an old grandma, i can tell my kids and grandkids that <b>I</b> was there when 9/11 happened. <b>I</b> was there when we went through both the war in Iraq and the war in Afgahnistan. <b>I</b> was there when Wall Street almost went kaput again. and of course, <b>I</b> was there when America had its history-defining moment of electing its first African-American president. and all this happened only in the 15 years that i've been in the US! who knows what else we can achieve?!

i'm definitely excited for the future of America. I can't wait to see what the new president will do and where he will lead America.

even though, America has progress in such a significant way, CALIFORNIA has taken a step back.

CA has always been the state where gays around the country can look at and be filled with hope that they will have a better future in which they can live their lives the way they wanted to. but since Prop 8 has pretty much passed (slim chance that absentee ballots will make a difference, i feel like CA has taken a step back. 

honestly, to me, even though the issue was definitely about homosexuality, the proposition was about equality. HOW can Californians support that fact that an amendment in our CONSTITUTION, where it states ALL are created EQUAL, is blatantly discriminating against a group?! that's just wrong!

but perhaps the times aren't right yet. i have hope that TRUE equality will happen in the future. let's hope that it will be in our lifetime."

"event","my final quarter at UCSD has started!! i've got the best schedule out of the four years that i've been here. i'm only taking 3 classes and they all seem intresting.

- Conservation and Human Predicament:
all about animals and the conservation efforts that are being used and being planned. we actually get to do a case study on a subtopic. i'm hoping to get marine conservation but it all depends on their schedules.

2 midterms, a final, and a case study. the midterms and the case study is worth 30% each. and if you did your math right, that means my FINAL is worth 10 PERCENT. hahaha

- Intro to Social Psychology
you know it going to be a good class when you walk into the lecture hall with bob marley playing, which then fades into trance. lol. very upbeat teacher and NOT boring. thank god. -_-

2 midterms and a final, but all worth the same and NOT cumulative. AND it's on the last day of lecture instead of during finals week.

- Human Sexuality
yuuuuuup. definitely the most interesting class. first of all, this class is soooo popular that there's no way you can get in unless you have senior standing. the waitlist is always 100+. second, the ""textbook"" isn't a textbook but a sex guide. yea...a SEX GUIDE called ""The Guide to Gettin' It On!"" it's like....860+ pages of texts AND pictures. definitely a conversation starter. the professor is funny and upbeat, totally comfortable with the subject

a midterm and final. 40%/60%. pretty standard

this all means that my finals week will be chiiiiiiiill like never before.

things to look forward to this quarter:
- FUSION 2008
- Kanye West Glow-In-The-Dark Tour
- APO Banquet
- SUNGOD: rumor has it that it's gonna be Sean Kingston*shrugs*
- APO Dance Comp

and probably a few more things =) all-in-all, it's shaping up to be a good quarter"

it's cool tho....cuz Flo Rida concert made up for it. seriously the most fun i've had while being sober at a dancey situation.

my sister switched internet providers back home about a month ago and now my mom can't find the new wireless network key. so now i'm stuck with using my mom's laptop...only at night. ARGH. i wanna use my OWN!!!

btw...while my mom was looking for the piece of paper with the password, she found old childhood documents of my sister and me. i looked through it and the most interesting finds were:

1. a birthday i wrote to my sister when i was 5. HILARIOUS...
2. my report cards from kidergaten
3. my report cards from 1st and (most of) 2nd grade...complete with pictures!! haha
4. the hospital bill from when i was born
5. MY SONOGRAM...!! lol wtf....

aaaaaaaand i finally realized that my parents weren't joking when they said they wanted a boy instead of me. -_- buuuuut i'm sure they're over it."

perhaps enough people will be home for the holidays so that i can have my b-day/xmas/NYE party. either that or everyone's taking me to a club. hahaha...perhaps a night of mayhem ending with a sleepover? who cares that i'm turning 22...sleepovers will never be out! hahaha"

"event","what was gonna be an ordinary sunday turned out to be pretty interesting.

so my mom got this coupon from her friend for this Korean spa place, PSY Health Town (http://www.psysauna.com) in San Leandro.

we decided to try the special body scrub and massage. the place was pretty clean...which is goooood. we started with a shower, the a deep soak in the jacuzzi, and finally a 5-min steam sauna before heading to our appt.

totally recommend it for a mother's day gift or something. i must say...can't be modest AT ALL. all-body MEANS all-body. the Korean ladies are in their underwear and the body scrub you while you're butt-naked. they scrub your back AND your front. hahaha...

after the 45-60min body scrub, which took off about 20 layers of dead skin, we showered again and spent another 3min in the steam room. then we headed back for an all-body massage that ended with a fresh cucumber face mask and a head massage. it was crazy relaxing...

then we went model-home-looking. it was fun...we looked at some in san jose and in milpitas. and also the ones in fremont! it's in the parking lot that used to be big 5 sporting goods, near IHS. it was coooool

aaaaaaaaand we ended the day with mogonlian hot pot in union city. *mMmMMmmMm* =D"

when my friend and i got off of the Nobel one this morning. we saw this guy who was on our bus get off, and then got on the Arriba shuttle. 

LOL because he was already on the Nobel one when we got on...which leads to one conclusion: he got on the wrong bus at school, stayed on it to get back to school, and got back on the right one.

how embarassing that we noticed. haha"

"event","last night, my two friends and i had just bought take-out indian and we decided to stop by a grocery to pick up some wine. as we were walking towards the entrance, this girl stopped us and asked us:

""what are you guys doing tonight?""

now...i was thinking: A) who the hell are you? B) i was gonna go home and eat indian food.

friend: ""why?""

girl: ""oh. well, there's a party tonight if you guys wanna come. it's at blah blah blah. my name's blah. here's my number.""

we walked away LOL-ing and thinking that was the most random thing ever....AND we decided we'd go.

alas...bitch didnt have her phone on when we called later so we couldn't figure out where the party was.

o well...it could've been great."

"event","wow...finally updating after almost 2 months of not really posting anything substantial.

the reason for my hiatus was partly because my comp's fucked up, but mostly it's cuz i'm pledging a co-ed service frat on campus, Alpha Phi Omega. =D *woot woot* for Rho Pi Chapter and Alpha Gamma Class! APhiO is seriously my life this qtr. i do somethin aphio related every single day...it's ridiculous...but at least this qtr's classes weren't too horrific. =D

it's been a lot of fun, a lot of work, and a bit of stress, but it's totally worth it cuz i'm meeting all these awesome people while i'm doing community service!

only a couple more weeks of this insanity left and then i'll be able to cross next qtr. thank goodness...any longer and i would've killed myself. -_- some of the requirements are kinda bullshit but whatever. it'll all be gravy once i've become an active.

so yea...i didn't really wanna post about APhiO until i've got some pictures from some of the events. and since i'm posting now...that means i've got pictures! =D yaaaaay!

The life cycle is all backwards.
You should die first, get that out of the way, 
then live twenty years in an old age home. 
You get kicked out when you're too young, 
you get a gold watch, you go to work. 
You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. 
You go to college until you're ready for high school. 
You go to grade school, you become a little child, 
you play, you have no responsibilities. 
You become a little baby, 
you go back into the womb, 
you spend your last nine months floating,
and you finish off as a gleam in your parents' eyes!"

"event","well, i guess it's time for an update.

a new year...a new quarter...and a new age. -_- *bloody hell*

anyhow, the first two weeks of classes have been aight, altho i was pooped out as hell last week. i was basically taking 5 classes at once because i was wait-listed for two of them and i wanted to see which one i would rather stick with. on top of that, i have 4 out of those 5 classes on tuesdays and thursdays. which meant that i had 4 1hr 20min. classes two days out of the week. *boooo* PLUS, i had work 3 days out of the week. but i got that changed and now i'm only working sundays and mondays.

but now that's it's second week, things have settled down and my schedule is pretty set.

math: pretty understandable so far. my professor is one of the better ones, meaning: i dun wanna shoot my brains out during lectures cuz it's so fucking boring.

bio: my prof is jewish. dunno why that's important, but that's what he told us. *shrug* this class is about evolution so THANK GOD it's not all those cell crap again. AP Bio <3. haha. altho the weird thing is that i havent studied bio since sophomore year....so that's about 4 yrs. hahaha

chem: class is gonna suck. i can already tell. professor is pretty young. he would actually look pretty darn cute if 1. changed his hairstyle, 2. wear contacts, and 3. dresses better. =D but he keeps lectures interesting. makes fun of people. lol. but we have pop quizzes. that sucks ass. -_-

hist: doesnt seem too bad. no final, just a final project so it'll be less stress on me. thank goodness.

so of course, with the hardcore studying, we've been doing some hardcore partying. MLK weekend = 3 straight nights of partying. =D had a lil black and white party on friday, went to a co-worker's surprise b-day party on saturday, and rico's cosmic party on sunday. too bad i only have pics from the 1st party. o well! =D

so my sis and her bf came down to visit today. i took them to daphne's for lunch and had golden spoon for dessert, then we headed over to the beach, because...well, you can't realli say that you've been to SD without at least SEEING the beach. the cove was the next spot. all the sea lions were so cute. hehehehe...it was so nice being right next to the ocean. 

then we went to seaport village. eh...it had a nice view but it wasnt overtly exciting. since they didnt wanna do any shopping, we went over to coronado island. at first i thought that would be a good tourist-y place, but i guess we didnt know where to look so i thought it was kinda boring. but we did stay for the sunset at the beach and it was beeeeeeeeautiful.

for dinner, we went to casa guadalajara and had some gooood mexican food. i had the shrimp fajitas and i tried some of my sis's seafood chimichanga. <-- to DIE for! it was sooooo good. lol

even though we were stuffed to our gills, we wanted desserts so i took them to extraordinary desserts by balboa park. i had this white chocolate cake thing and i couldnt finish it. but now i feel like passing out from being so full. *bleh*

but all in all...it was a nice day to run around SD. ^_^"

not only that, but i spent last night in my apartment studying for midterms with the rest of my nerdy apartmentmates. lol...the only thing that i did last night was going over to douglas to cut cake for andy's birthday. and that only took 1/2 hr cuz everyone else had the same midterm to study for. lol...it was quite sad.

i swear...i'll spend my future halloweens, at least once, in Santa Barbara and Castro! *rawr* but it's ok tho, cuz i got my party on on friday and saturday night.

to promote this month's cancer awareness, the club i'm involved with, (Colleges Against Cancer), has decided to make t-shirts to sell. Profits will be donated to the American Cancer Society for Breast Cancer research. 


this one is for Men (just in case you didnt know). font is pink because breast cancer awareness COLORS/slogans are PINK.

i need some feedback before our club actually order them. What do you guys think?? Would you buy these shirts if you were a college student?? ANY FEEDBACK would be VERY HELPFUL!!!! please let me know!! (we dont want to shove out 400 bucks and not sell any =/ ) and the price would be around $10!"

"event","ahhh...back in sunny SD. ^_^

moving in this year was definitely less stressful than last year's. had a lot of good times before school actually started on thursday.

classes so far:

HIEA 114:::Postwar Japan:::seemed ok enough. grading is based on two papers. MT and Final. 40%/60%, respectively

COGN 20:::Intro to Comm.:::professor seems pretty good. the reading is (thankfully) more interesting than WCWP. so hopefully i can do at least decent in this class.

i felt so productive today. all because i woke up and went to the library with my roommate and actually got some work done. =D i also felt like a nerd because everyone else we passed on the way were heading for the beach. =/ it's all good i guess.

started my first job EVER on thursday. just working at CV aka our friendly dining hall. had a 7hr shift on thursday. and boy...was i pooped the fuck out when i came home. the worst was working in the dish room for closing. totally sucked. but at least the people are hella nice...=D plus...i'm getting paid!



!~i saw a giant rat thing on my way to class the other day. i thought it was dead cuz it didnt move, but then it was gone when i came back down...*dun dun dun*"

"event","Ok,well here's how it's going down Sunday I went to my little brother's games and his team won both and then on monday I was feeling bad so I didn't go to school and I went to the doctor and they said that I have the flu so I have just been layin around watching TV and eating popsicles for like 3 days and it has been totally boring and I can't go back to school like monday, and I definitely can't play in the soccer games this weekend and I think that is the worst part. The other sad thing that has happened lately is that Whitney is gonna move back to florida like really soon as I'm writing this she is probably like packing her stuff to go back to Florida! Gonna miss you Whit!"

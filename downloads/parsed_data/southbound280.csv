I hate school right now, I am so done with the same old things... Today I skated with my cousin Donnnie, his friend Mitch, and a bunch of really talented individuals... Then I went to a party at Courtney's house because I had nothing better to do, and it made me really depressed... I can't stand ""popular"" people, it's like they are all the same damn person, they all talk the same, use the same stupid phrases, where the same played out clothes, listen to the worst music I have ever heard... Ugh... Mainstream media is such bullshit and anyone that follows it are fucking plastic dolls, I can't stand it... Why can't people just be themselves? I mean, every guy there knew the lyrics to every song that came on, like britney spears every rap sond, EVERYTHING... I think I'm almost done with that youth group, the only thing there is Steve Folge but that's it... It's like, ""hey if you want to be cool, come to this youth group and hang out with these people and dress like us and listen to all of the music we are told to listen to and you will be soooo cool...""

"event","Aight... #1 is the other night I was talkin to my homie Avarik (his nickname) and he happens to be an avid computer (geek, no offense Avarik I love you)gamer... So I start asking him about some random stuff... First off, this is what is in his AIM profile... (Wai is the nickname of one of his friends)


Avarik has been banned from FilesNetwork until 2037:
Reason: (continued on his old foot. We're pursueing legal action against both Wai and Avarik)
Reason - Hacking, harassing staff members, using blackmail to get on staff, spamming, flaming, breaking rules 1-6 numerous times, and other foul language, Everything in the book.

Ok so if that isn't funny enough, I asked him what the most offensive thing I could say in 1337 talk was...
(1337 stands for ""Leet"" a word associated with computer nerds and 1337 talk is there ""language"")
So here is what he says...

Avarik : PH34R M3 I R 1337, i could pwn j0o jewbags so bad, I am teh frag mast0rz!!1 50RRY 455 N07 1337 1053|25!!!!111onehundredandeleven

Avarik : I 4M 50 1337 I PWN MY531F!!1

x2luvand2beluvdx : translate

Avarik : fear me i am leet, 

Avarik : im the frag master, sorry ass not leet losers

Avarik : im so leet i pwn myself!

_________________________________________________

Alright, so if that isn't funny enough... I got another story about my favorite little sister... Satan.

Well, today my mother brought me some information that was quite amusing... As it turns out, today on her 5th day of school, my little sister satan was suspended! Oh Yes, how woonderful she is, she is truly the worlds greatest daughter, don't you agree mom, well yes you do... But I don't...
So here's what she did...
Apparently her and her little friends wanted to play some basketball (unlikely, but ok we'll give it to her)... But there were already some kids on the court, so satan decides that if they don't give up the court to her and her friends, she's going to quote ""Go get a 5th grader to beat them up""... Okay okay... timeout... 
HahahAhahHAHAAHAHAHahahahHAhAhhaHAhHahHahHAhAHaHHAhHAhaHAHhha!!!! OKay time in... So, as she procedes to find a ""5th grader"" her little friends used some common sense and thought, ""Aight us niggets bettuh bust out 'fo Abbizzle gets us hoes busted 'fo shizzzle!"" So them hoes bounced... So sure enough Satan returns to the scene with a ""big 5th grader"" who as Satan herself proclaimed was ""dumb"" (A.K.A. as special education child)Okay another timeout... HahahAhahHAHAAHAHAHahahahHAhAhhaHAhHahHahHAhAHaHHAhHAhaHAHhha!!!! Time in... So sure enough the ""big special 5th grader,"" who apparently didn't know his own strength, proceeded to beat the hell out of this little 4th grader... So as a consequence, Satan and the ""big special 5th grader"" were both suspended... On the 5th day of school... So now Satan is being transferred to a new elementry school, and she hasn't stopped crying since... I love my little sister... Just kidding."

"event","So now August will end,
With nothing but pain...
Like the last couple months,
And now I must drain
All these feelings of love,
Locked here within...
With no healthy way out,
Just the usual sin...

And I wait,
Hoping for some advice,
Or a song,
That tells of the price 
You must pay
To truly entice her
To come, back to you...

I know I'm to blame,
As much as she is...
And I try to change,
But there's no sufficient
Proof that she cares,
Just words of encouragement
And countless prayers
That hint towards abandonment...

And I wait,
Hoping for some advice,
Or a song,
That tells of the price 
You must pay
To truly entice her
To come, back to you...

So starts another month,
Bring on the pain!
I have readied myself,
And here I will stay.
A new beginning to this end,
But maybe one day
You will be...
Mine again?

And I wait,
Hoping for some advice,
Or a song,
That tells of the price 
You must pay
To truly entice her
To come, back to you...

Today I was cramped in a car with 4 people in the backseat, when we barely missed hitting some big metal plate that fell out of a truck in front of us, and when I looked back, I see a bunch of cars dodging and colliding... one minivan slammed into the center divider... while this was going on, I was in the middle of listening to one of my old friends talk about how many girls he's been with... I used to hang out with this guy before I was a christian... I was disgusted by what he was telling me, yet I just listened... What would have happened to me if I didn't decide to go on a church retreat with some friends a couple of years ago? What if I didn't except the lord into my heart? What if I didn't meet... Would I be in his same position? I really felt bad for the guy... Then I think of my ""Christian"" friends... Why must the people that are supposed to be by my side and loving and ""clean"" entering into a world of crap? I mean, you've gotta be blind to not see the disater that they are setting themselves up for... I can seriously only think of two of my close friends that I can trust not to be stupid... I mean... I need help, don't get me wrong, everyone needs help... And, while listening to this guy go on about how he's ""addicted"" to ""$#$$%"", I wanted to grab him and scream ""WHY?"" I told him that I was gonna wait until I am married... He was astounded, he couldn't believe it... I wanted to ask him if he planned on marrying a girl that he just ""liked,"" or the woman of his dreams? I wanted to ask if he was just gonna like her, or adore her... because I know that I'm gonna marry the girl of my dreams... and I figure that the only thing that I can really give my wife... better than any gift... is myself... I don't feel comfortable ""sharing"" her gift with others, I mean I really want my wife to know that she means absolutely EVERYTHING to me... But I'm not like, OMG no kissing!!! I just don't think that I should be trying to go as far as I can without actually crossing the line like some of my ""friends"" do... And it's not even just that stuff... Is underage drinking against the law? Yes. Does the bible say that you should obey the laws of the land you live in? Yes. Think about that guys... Anyways I'm out 'cus Kevin is here... Bye."

Lately I've been wishing I had one desire,
Something that would make me never want another,
Something that would make it so that nothing matters,
All would be clear then...

But I guess I'll have to settle for a for a few brief moments,
And watch it all dissolve into a single second,
And try to write it down into a perfect sonnet,
Or one foolish line...

Because that's all that you'll get! 
So you'll have to accept,
You are here, 
and then you're gone...

<font color=""red"">But I believe that lovers should be tied together, 
And thrown into the ocean in the worst of weather!
And left there to drown; 
Left there to drown
In their innocence!

But as for me I'm coming to the final chapter,
I read all of the pages and there is still no answer!
Only all that was before I know must soon come after,
That is the only way it can be...</font>

So I stand in the sun!
And I breathe with my lungs...
Trying to spare myself the weight of the truth.

<font color=""red"">Saying everything you have ever seen was just a mirror,
And you've spent your whole life sweating in an endless fever,
And now you are laying in a bathtub full of freezing water,
Wishing you were a ghost...

But once you knew a girl and you named her lover,
And danced with her in kitchens through the greenest summer,
But autumn came, she disappeared,
You don't remember where she said she was going to...</font> 

But you know that she is gone! 
Because she left you a song,
That you don't want to sing...

<font color=""red"">We're singing I believe that lovers should be chained together!
And thrown into a fire with their songs and letters!
And left there to burn in their arrogance!

But as for me I'm coming to my final failure,
I've killed myself with changes trying to make it better!
But I still ended up becoming something other than what I had planned to be...</font>

Now I believe that lovers should be draped in flowers,
And layed entwined together on a bed of clovers,
And left there to sleep...
Left there to dream of their happiness..."

And I know what must change. 
<font color=""red"">Fuck my face, Fuck my name... 
They are brief and false advertisements for a soul I don't have.</font>
Something true I have lacked 
and spent my whole life trying to make up for. 
But I found in a song
and in the people I love. 
They will lift me up out of darkness. 
Now my door stands open. 
I am inviting everyone in. 
We're gonna laugh, 
we're gonna drink until the morning comes. 
That is what we are going to do."

But it sucked because we got there too late and the main arena was sold out :/ but we still got to see some street skating and got a bunch of free stuff... This past week has been pretty kool too, I'vs been skating allot and I learned a couple new tricks at Liberty (o ya backside 180's and big spin's outta the big quarter pipe) So ya I've been out and about allot...

I really hope the rest of the summer isn't like these last couple days :/ I hope that she realizes how much she means to me... I can't wait for September 4th so I can get my liscence and hopefully a car so I can get the hell out of here and have a life... My dad keeps pressuring me to go look for a job, but I don't think anyone will hire me while I'm still 15... Why does she treat me like this and why doesn't anyone care? The only person I can confide in lives an hour away (in bus time) Everyone else just doesn't give a shit. Ugh my life would be so much better if she wasn't so blind, I'd have someone else to talk to, to hang out with, to care about... but most of all someone else to care about me, cus right now hardly anybody does... I think I'm gonna go write music... Haha, one more thing... The girl I'm talking about won't even bother to read this... Depression is a fever..."

Because if I can't make myself feel better then how can I expect anyone else to give a shit? And I <font color=""red"">scream</font> for the sunlight, or a car to take me anywhere.

"event","Last night was the best night of my freakin life... Allright here's the scoop... Me, Jon, Kevin, Gerry, Glenn, and Jesse (my friend Jesse, belive me the names will get confusing later) went to see Dashboard Confessional, The Get Up Kids, and Thrice. We showed up really early and didn't go in till like 7. So we're sittin outside because we didn't need to get in line cus Jon's sister was gettin us in for free (with backstage passes), and we find out that Jon's sister is gonna come get us in front with John Leffler (the new guitarist for Dashboard and a hell of a cool guy). So we're all freakin out, then sure enough here comes John (Leffler, his name has the ""H"" and my friend Jon doesn't) and Jesse (Jon's sister and John's gf) come walking around the front where everyone is in line to get us. Then we start walkin and laughin while everyone in line is like, ""Is that John Leffler?"" OMG it was sooo kool. Then we go get our tickets and John gives us all our backstage passes. After that was takin care of, we went on the Dashboard Tour buss (OMG!!!). LoL so then we all went in durring the end of the opening band, they were The Format or something, and while everyone was leavin durring the intermission, we all pushed ourselves up to the front of the crowd for a good view of THE GET UP KIDS!!!! OMG when they came on I was so happy I couldn't believe it, it was the greatest part of te night I think, they played awesome songs like ""I'll Catch You"" and ""Up On The Roof"", I was really suprised by the song selection cus I figured they would probanly just go on and play all their new stuff but I was very impressed when they mixed it up. So when they finished; me, Jon, Gerry, Glenn, and Jesse went up to go to the bathroom and stuff, but we lost Kevin while The Get Up Kids were playin. I wanted to buy something too, so I figured since EVERYONE is the whole damn place wanted to see Thrice, I'd buy somethin durring their first couple songs (plus none of us wanted to be down in the crowds with all the big a$$ hardcore guys). So I ended up buyin a belt buckle that says D*C on it, and while I was in the bathroom puttin it on, Thrice started playin ""Kill Me Quickly"" so I ran out to watch it. LoL it was so funny watching the pits for Thrice, I must of seen like 2,000 guys get #$%&*@ up. But Thrice put on an AWESOME show... Soooo much energy, plus I really respect them because they were tellin the audience to help out people if they got hurt in the pits, plus they were talkin about all these charitys they help out and how they are going to play some shows at anti-abortion rallys. So when Thrice ended, we decided to go back into the audience, it was so funny cus all the hardcore guys were leavin and sayin ""Alright, all emo kids to the front!"" Haha it was great.So Gerry and Glenn get up really close before D*C started, and me Jesse and Jon went back to the sound board are to just kinda chill and watch. Then us three decided we wanted to go back up to the front, but there were sooo many people by that time, that we didn't know how to get there... Haha so we talk to Jon's sister and she gets this bodygaurd guy to make people clear out by sayin ""Excuse me.. these guys are with the band."" and we ended up walkin like all the way up hahaha. So we're like standin there talking, and we were surrounded by girls :), and we started talkin about goin backstage after and these girls started like rubbin up against us hahaha. But ya it was reeeaalllyyy crammed in so we decided to go back out again lol, this time as we were leaving, Chris (Carrabba) walked on stage, and every girl in the whole place started screaming... so I looked at Jesse and Jon, and I'm like ""Every girl in here just had an orgasm!"" lol it was hilarious. So we watch the show, witch I must say was amazing. They, like The Get Up Kids, had a great mixture of songs... like their new song ""Vindicated,"" their classic ""Remember to Breathe"" in which Chris dragged it out for like another 3 minutes with new lyrics, and ""Again I Go Unnoticed"" (hell ya Jesse!!!). So after they ended, we all met up at the sound board area. Glenn and Gerry showed up, Glenn was literally soaked in sweat from everyone around him Lol. Then after the whole show, Kevin showed up and tells us that he was all the way in the very front since The Get Up Kids! So after most of the people had left, we all went backstage. We walked in and John was layin on the floor in the hall hahaha, he got up and took us to this caterring room and got us all drinks and pizza... After a little while, Scott (D*C's bassist) came in and hung out with us, he was really kool, him and John were funny as hell. Then one of The Get Up Kids came in, he was drunk of his a$$ haha. So we were just chillin there, there were like, I'd say 50 people in there... Noone really important except John, Scott, and the drunk Get Up Kid. So then, the 6 of us, plus John and cott go outside. Me and Jesse were dying to meet Matthew Pryor of The Get Up Kids, so John went over to their bus and convinced him to come meet us.. OMG he came over and we just talked to him and took pics with him and stuff, he was sooooo kool! I got the whole diddy about Reggie and the Full Effect, we laughed about the ""drunk girl at the get up kids show,"" and I gave him props on the New Amsterdams. So ya my life is complete, then here comes Cris Carrabba... OMG... He was pretty kool too, but there were so many people who were waitin for his autograph and stuff that he only hung with us for a little while... But it was worth it, I shook his hand and hugged him and got a picture... HELL YES... So then we just hung out with John and Scott some more (they are officially the koolest members of the band, cus Chris is always doin stuff and the drummer is an ass cock head who doesnt even come out after the shows to greet his fans... lol none in the band likes him, we were laughin with Jon's sister about how he's lucky he's good..Lol). After all that, we left and Jon's sister got a ride with us, so we stopped at Denny's and she treated us all to ""breakfast"" lol... I didn't get home till like 3 I think... It was the best night EVER... BIG A$$ THANX to Jon, his sister Jesse, and John Leffler for hookin us all up... I LOVE YOU ALL... O ya I got a ton of pics with us and the bands... I post them if I can..."

"event","Finally for the first time in a millenium i weigh under 230 pounds(228).  It may not sound like much but just a year ago i weigh 260 pounds and was sooooo out of shape.  Now i can actually run for 20 minutes without having to stop and gasp for air.  Im proud of myself.  My goal is to reach 190 before next summer then it will time for the women to come calling."

"event","Man im bored.  Nothing exciting ever happens.  Im seriously regretting going to a school where there are about 20 black students and 15 of them play on the basketball team.  I have nothing in common with anyone.  There are so many ignorant people here that make comments about black people that i just wanna choke em.  But that would just reinforce their stereotypes about us. I can't wait to move back to New York."

"event","Had a horrible Thanksgiving.  It seems everytime i go home nowadays i get the feeling im not wanted there. The food was great but my family is so aggravating.  And the funny thing is the only reason im in school is cause of them.  How ironic.  Oh yeah my cousin had this hot friend who i been trying to get with but she gave the same sorry ass excuse that they all give.  It starts like this:  ""You are such a sweet guy but......<insert excuse here>""  Called me old fashioned but wasnt being nice once a prerequisite to getting girls.  Now it seems like all you have to do is treat them like shit and they will come running.  I wish a girl would be blunt and give me a straight up answer. Im so sick of everything.  This world is too fucked up."

"event","This journal stuff is nice im really enjoying so i decided to do chat some more.  Recently a girl i was in love with for about three years got in touch with me again.  We went to high school together and to make a long story short i was infatuated with her and she couldnt care less about me.  We were friends though but everytime i asked her out she turned me down.  She took advantage of everything i did though.  I remember she made me buy her all this shit. I was just getting over her when she decided to instant message me.  Her name is Mary.  I remember she used to date all these guys and i would just lay in bed thinking how i could become them.  It was sick i promised myself i wouldnt like someone like that again.  Anyway thought id get that off my chest.  Later."

*friday* Natalie Ashley Monique London and I went to the movies and saw white noise. That movie creeped me out so much, I'm still not sure why it really did. Jose and some other guys went too. After the movies I went to London's.

*saturday* Natalie Hill Marin Nicole London and I went to Kyle's house. Met a few cute guys,( cough cough Lee) haha. Then there was this girl who I didnt know so i yelled ""Who are you?"" and she freaked out on me. Aw man it was great. Then we just ended up playing poker and i won! woot. Afterwards Natalie London and I spent the night at Hill's. 

*sunday* Went to krispy kreme! i love those donuts, especially the chocalate ones. I can only have one though, or else i feel sick. Then we decided to play card games. Good times.


So pretty much this weekend was spent with all the gals. <3 Gotta love em!

"event","I'm in Scotland now. I am absolutely freezing! If it wasnt for alex's sweater and my big poofy red jacket i would be frozen in the walkway right now.It gets dark here around 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I love my grandpa's house. It's right on the harbor and throughout the day you can watch the tide come in and out. This morning i slipped on the icy path, it was pretty funny. I love scotland though. I also realized how much I dont want to come home besides seeing Kimmie and a few friends at school. 

I went to see my grandma today. That was extremely hard... i've never felt someone so cold, and stiff before. She was wearing a cream silk dress and is going to be cremated tomorrow. In her coffin, she has pictures of all of us. Her face didnt really look like herself, maybe it was her skin color. I cannot get her face out of my head. But it was peaceful, and i'm glad i did it. 

I'm nervous about tomorrow. I dont think i will be able to hold myself together that well. I still need to go down the high street ( kinda like a huge shopping area) with Amy and buy some dark glasses. 

Right now i am in the kirkaldy library, where my grandma used to go when she was really young to get books. She was so wise, and enjoyed books. Ha.. here i am talking about her again. My grandpa was telling me a story of when they were both 16, and my grandma had spent the night but they had to have seperate rooms. i hope he will be alright, its just killing me seeing how alone he is. he told me he's lost his best friend. 

Oh how i miss kimmie right now. Kimmie... i dont know what you want but i will get you something after the funeral i really dont have anything else on my mind but that so dont worry i will get you something nice! 

I also went to see my grandparents old house, where Amy and I stayed last time we were in scotland together. that was about 2 or 3 years ago. Wow, my grandma didnt even get to see me without my braces. 

I only have 17 minutes left on this computer and i'm going to go and see if scotland gets aim! ... access denied damn.

heres something quite interesting...


as i was walking out from just seeing my grandma, i looked over to this far away castle, and asked my grandpa ""isnt that where we used to go and see the seals with grandma last time we came?"" and he said Yes. Then about 2 minutes later my mom said ""katy come here"" so i went over to her and she said ""look"" I looked back to where the castle was and there were two rays of light coming out of the sky. Now i dont know if i believe in a heaven or god or what not, but i believe it was a sign. And i know shes alright."

"event","I wonder if there is a god. And why he has made my family hurt so much these past few months. I know everyone dies, we all do, but there always seems a pattern in my family. Not only have i lost my dog, but ive lost my gran, along with my great uncle. and now my grandpa and my great aunt are left all alone. they have lost the loves of their lives, and are left without them for the remaining of their lives. i cannot stand to think of my grandpa living alone. i love him so much and its killing me knowing what he is going through. it's just killing me.

my grandma was without a doubt the most loving and the most hilarious person you would ever meet. everyone who met her always had something funny to say about her, and how much they enjoyed talking and being with her. i'm going to miss the long conversations we shared, yet i will always remember her. i believe that she is still with me. and whenever i need her all i have to do is talk to her. today i was sitting out back with Alfie, and the chair which she used to sit in when she was over began to rock. maybe it was just the wind, but i believe she was with me. and she always will be. i just wish she had more time to live. but then i am being selfish.

school has been extremely hard. Good thing its done for a few weeks. i've been fighting so hard not to break down. i need to stay strong for my family. i will have time to cry when i need it, but for now i need to be here for my mom and my sister especially. 

However Kimmie has always been there for me, ever since the age of 4, we've hit it off. it's really great to have someone to talk with about life, and what i believe in. she's always been there to listen to what i have to say and to cry with me. she's the only person who knows how i am feeling, and who can help me through this. shes my best friend, and i dont know what i would do without her. i get jealous of her because of how religious she is, and i feel bad about feeling this way. i just wish i could be more like her. she's my idol.

I dont know what i believe. I don't believe in a god, i am considering reincarnation. If there were a god, why would he want us to hurt? So he can teach us that everything happens for a reason? Does he take those we love because we are not grateful for them? I am extremely angry and upset and all i can do is ask why. And that one question cannot be answered, so i am left hanging not knowing what to believe, say, or think.


Death does not hurt the one who is dying, death hurts those who loved the one who died. My grandpa is left all alone. i cant stand the thought of him being alone. 

I am going to scotland this saturday until the 30th of december to be with my family.

I've decided i want to go back to six flags as a senior for a trip or something. But i'd rather fly than take that looooong drive there again. Phew. 


I don't like going to dance anymore. The girls at my studio talk too much crap about people i know and it bothers me. Gah. How come some people are just so not understanding? I'm thinking of quitting dance altogether, hmmmm"

"event","Danced at the state fair... ahahaha DISASTER! it was fun to mess up though, since everyone thought it was meant to happen... ha!


I really enjoyed hanging out with my dad and brother at the fair. Sounds odd yes i know, but it's nice just hanging out with the family once in a while. I haven't really done anything with them for the longest time.


Tomorrow i'm thinking i'm going BACK to the fair with Loobs. Hopefully a lot of ourtowners come. :0) Woot.


3 days until California. Then i will be riding roller coasters like a mofo. Hell yea. <3"

"event","Over the weekend, i attended the anytown camp. I met an amazing group of people, and i wish i would never have to leave that place. Up there, in the mountains, with all the cabins and the trees, we were happy, and we accepted people no matter what color skin they had, no matter what their sexual identity was, or no matter what gender they were. 


If only the world we lived in was exactly like that small community. 


I hope people who talk to me now realize that i have different views towards life and things said to me or to someone else DO affect me. I want everyone to realize that one person CAN make a difference. You are able to believe in anything you want. I am going to help our world slowly accept people for who they are, and not what identifies them. What are you going to do?"

"event","Wow horrible day. Today i held my dog Henry for one last time, told him i loved him one last time, and hugged him so tight for one last time. I havw nwvwe cried that hard in my entire life. Jackie Drenth is the sweetest girl i know and i would like to thank you for being such a great friend to me today. Kimmie i love you dearly. You know that though. Ourtown tomorrow. I can't wait to meet new people, i'm so tired of the clicks and the bitchiness of my friends at school. That motivation speech really made me think about life, and the people i know. I think it's time to meet new people, and broaden my horizon. Thats all for now.



Henry McDuff Flucker will always remain in my heart forever <3

I was teaching him as well as a lot of girls this advanced dance. Haha. It was so funny to watch them. Only sucky thing about today is i'm burnt, and worn out. So i dont know what i am doing tonight. And i am sick of staying home, yet again i'm always worn out to go out. Gah. 


best part, getting gum thrown at me, as well as being told to shut the fuck up while holding my sign at the end of the street for cars. Haha. Good times.


Only 5 days left until camp. I am so freakin excited! oh my gosh. I love making so many new friends, and not just because of looks. :)"

I never realized how much i annoy people. I mean wow, i was with this guy nearly all summer, had great times, and now i am ""annoying and i talk too much."" i thought friends are allowed to talk to each other? Oh wait, i guess we're not friends.


I have never felt so down about something before. Wow. It really makes me feel sick, and rather depressed. Gosh. I just wish he wasn't so two faced.


On a brighter note... tomorrow is a carwash. Yee Yeah. Party time on greenfield and baseline.

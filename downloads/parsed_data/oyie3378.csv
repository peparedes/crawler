"event","<p>hey wow!&nbsp;&nbsp;neat! awesome!&nbsp;cool! ridiculous! insane, man. <br /><br /><br />where was my mind before. why couldnt i see the beauty in this world for so long. i was selfish. naturally- i am human! and also too realistic. yes, before i did accept that i knew nothing at all and never would&nbsp; be able to understand the mysteries of existence.&nbsp; but, now, what is appealing to me is what exactly i dont know. i have this new inspiration to use my brain to its fullest potential and understand the workings of our universe as we have come to accept it, and perhaps then i can properly say, i know nothing essentially. however, i will also have the ability to join the progressive thought of science in the world and, yes, this is all based on a great deal of ""hope"" if you will, but nothing near ""faith"". The mystery is no longer discouraging but more so encouraging.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, basically, I want to study astrophysics.&nbsp;<br /><br />Even if its just a minor attempt, i want to test my limits, see where i can go.&nbsp;<br /><br />My parents never really raised me as a kid but more as a miniature adult, so i guess i never really understood how much euphoria there can be in learning. it was more of a i need this to please others and get stuff kind of situation. luckily i would occasionally enjoy some of the stuff i learned. now i realize, looking back, science was the only thing that really sparked my brain back in middle school. then ofcourse came lit and philosophy,&nbsp;which really got me going, until ofcourse i got in a major mental rut.&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophy made me hate the nature of scientific studies because they seemed so foreign and cold, or 'irrelevnt'. the world of literature ofcourse kept me interested in school&nbsp;because of its bittersweet, humane warmth...&nbsp;but now i see that there really is no difference, &nbsp;philosophy/lit&nbsp;and science are essentially two sides of the same coin, if you will!&nbsp;<br /><br />anyway, i guess this means my ambition in life right now is to understand what we have inferred about the universe so far and use this knoweledge to somehow create something that has significance to the progression or digression of today's generally accepted scientific facts. <br /><br /></p>"

"event","i have the worst allergies ever. i feel like my soul burstS out of my fucking nose everytime i sneeze good god. anyway, i made this cake today and it was going to be perfect except for the fucking assinine oven that fucked up and ruined everything. i dont know why i got so upset about it, but, it just makes me think about everything else i've done this year and how i've managed to fuck up most of the time. i dont know if it's the best analogy since the fuck up was due to the oven's messed up thermometer, but, it makes me feel better that atleast it happened for some type of reason, like, to become an analogy for everything thats been on my mind- well, i could do that with almost any event, but WHATEVER. the point is i feel shitty and i have to stay at home and pretend like im as happy as can be while I try to convince my relatives visiting from turkey (who came today) that I am not, quote from my mom a ""free willy"" or in other words ""wild and disrespectful"", meaning, i have to stay home all the time and pretend i have no social life. i also started weight watchers and going to the gym... i would say that i hate it, but, its actually making me feel less stressful about things and hopeful about the temporary existences of my whale thighs and ""pot"" belly. i think pot belly should now be used as a reference to weight gain from pot. well, atleast in my case, because it has definately happened...
also, i dont know what the fuck was wrong with me when i was leaving d.c. but, the night before i left, i had a huge break down and cried for the first time in a long time, i mean, cried like in the most extreme sense, with all the heaving and what not. i just felt lost and as if all my decisions were completely arbitrary. i also kept feeling so dissapointed in myself. i used to get straight a's in highschool. i used to find pleasure in so many more things than i do now. i also felt like i was stronger before. those feelings eventually passed, however, the next night they came back, as i had missed my flight that next morning and had to check back into my dorm, uhhghhhh. that sucked. then i just cried another two hours. i hadn't cried like that in years, im pretty sure. i couldnt breath. i didnt know how to stop it. it felt like it was coming from somewhere that i couldnt reach or control. it was quite a spectacle. something about going back home made me feel a&nbsp;blast of dissapointment and frustration with&nbsp;myself. i just&nbsp;felt so alone and useless, as well as plain childish. i dont mind that really, but, i guess i&nbsp;forgot how emotionally unstable children tend to be. i am not an adult. i dont think i will be for a&nbsp;while.
i&nbsp;want to not give a fuck, but my parents make me worry so fucking much. their worrisome ways really have affected me mentally and emotionally. god damn, i thought it would never get to me. i guess its in my blood. i dont know. my head hurts and i have been up since 7am. i had a good night last night though. i should start looking at the positive side of things, but, then again, its all irrelevent, or relevant, whichever. nevermind i am going to bed. i will probably destroy this soon."

"event","Jesus Fucking Christ i never thought translating could be this hard. I just finished my spanish translation class' final translation project and i feel like i've just been anally raped. language is so fucking ridiculous. translation is the most difficult thing i have ever attempted because it essentially can not be done...ever. there's no such thing as a perfect translation because you cant possibly make one culture = another culture, which is basically what translation attempts to do. its just amazing how much of a language barrier there is amongst us. i dont understand how we have made our means of communication so intricately complicated. communication is so hard, why? because understanding humans is hard. we barely know what the fuck is going on in our minds, how the hell can we even attempt to explain it to someone else. 

&nbsp;i cant explain this is in the most adequate manner, but what i have come to learn from this class and from other experiences is that a word itself is nothing more than a metaphor. language in itself is as much undefined as our means of existence. we are basically a bunch of people spitting out these words one after another that are all essentially questions, metaphors and grunts. when we communicate, we're basically just acknowledging one another and sharing our thoughts and questions about our strange existence. because this is usually unanswered, we just accumulate stories about our lives that don't have anything to do with anything and tell them to other people to give each other information about things we have experienced that we are at least pretty sure is valid and fill the void with word after word until we die. i guess one argument to this would be, well, if it weren't for communication, we wouldn't be civilized or able to create and structure this modern, technological world. well, so what? technological advances and scientific discoveries are great, but have they added anything to the intellect of human kind? not really. the fall of Greek philosophy and the rise of christianity basically stopped that progression. i guess we were going a bit crazy back then, but, what if religion wasn't spread throughout the entire world, would we have evolved intellectually? would we have conquered the brain and used it to its fullest power? why was thinking so bad? i guess the thought process is an eternal spiral leading towards nothingness, but then again, what if we could have achieved ESP and other mind powers that allowed us to use the 'force' like yoda and Carry. 

just looking at this page of words, i feel like its all so completely unnecessary and that no one who reads this is going to really give a flying fuck. but, i am bored, and, sharing thoughts and feelings is all i can essentially do with myself in this world. i guess i can help the poor and help fight aids and cancer and all that fun stuff, but, right now, im completely dependent on my family and can barely take care of my own god damn self, so fuck it. what difference would it make if i did help some one out there? i guess it would make me feel better about myself and better about my existence, but, really, it doesnt fucking matter. i just want to live in the middle of no where with my mate and fuck and smoke pot and enjoy nature till i can be one with it when i die. maybe civilization will take a turn and perhaps evolve their minds, or maybe aliens will come and teach us how to do it. or maybe it doesn't fucking matter anymore. i have to pee."

"event","sweet. i have fucking tonsilitis. i went to the hospital last night around midnight because i couldn't handle the pain. i also started coughing up specs of blood and started freaking out. luckily, the hospital wasn't too crowded. there was alot of old people having old people problems though. i don't want to get old like those people. they were so helpless and reliant on their children. i feel like as soon as i'm at that point i would just pull the plug or trip on acid and smoke lots of opium. 

i have mixed feelings about the hospital. it's a good place when you're in pain and are eventually relieved of it, but it's really disturbing to see other patients suffering. last time i went to sybley hospital, on my way out, there was this wrinkly old bony lady in a dim lit ward softly saying ""im going to make it""over and over again to the wall. it wasn't the most elevating experience. i felt a pang in my chest for a second. then i left. how do doctors deal with the presence of death around them all the time? it seems like it would be a very depressing job, but i guess most jobs are depressing in one respect or the other. they probably weigh the benefits of aiding the suffering people more so than the constant presence of dying people around them. i dont think i could handle it though. 

so, now that i have had my third case of sickness due to smoking heavy cigarettes, i have decided to quit smoking altogether. i hate smoking light cigarettes because they don't fulfill my nicotine crave, which usually leads me to buy heavier cigarettes. i used to be able to smoke lucky strikes like a champ. god damn my fickle lungs. if only there was a way to smoke and not harm our bodies.&nbsp; i dont really need cigarettes, they just fill the void sometimes. i guess i just need to be stronger and fill it with something else. like candy! mmm or sex. but, i usually love a good cigarette after a nice session of sex. not in bed ofcourse, that would be sleezy. Damn, i'm going to miss you tobacco. Someday they will discover a way to smoke cigarettes and have them not harm you. That will be my motivation to quit for now."

"event","its late again and i'm still up. i can't go back to sleep because i want to hear my boyfriends voice before i can get myself to it. i havent talked to him since last night and we only talked for a little bit because he was tired. he has been so busy and i havent, so i think that just makes me miss him more when i can't talk to him because he's preoccupied with music and stuff. his phone dies alot also which doesnt make the matter any better. i wish he would call soon. i can't sleep. i just watched a bunch of video clips from planet earth on the discovery channel website. i love nature and wild life. i wish sometimes my thoughts and emotions were as simple as a snow leopard's. or maybe a big blue whale. they get to chill in the water all the time and just swim around. i love the water. i think before this life, i was some kind of water creature because i have an extreme love for the ocean. apparently when i was born i was the only baby that didnt cry in the bath. hmmm. i wonder if i really was some sea creature in one of my past lives. i'm also a pisces, but that might be a bit irrelevant.&nbsp; that would be interesting if it were really true tho and i could prove it. ha. but thats not going to happen. perhaps in a world of my own. 

i hope this sinus pain and sore throat i am feeling will go away soon. i must quit smoking cigarettes. i cant fucking swallow my spit because it hurts so bad. why does smoking always effect me in the worst of ways? doesnt matter. i must put an end to it. 

i was officially quitting yesterday after i smoked my last marlboro, but, then i bummed a bunch from other people as the day proceeded and alas, the operation failed. but today, er, tomorrow i guess, i am putting an end to it because this soreness seems to have been accumulating for the past week and i have been ignoring it. i have no need for it god damnit. its just when i get high or right after a meal i need it most, as well as during times of stress. i think summer will help me kick the habit though. i hope...

i guess i'll try to go to sleep then. seeming how my boyfriend is either passed out at his band's house without a charger or out playing desolate notes to a dark and mellow crowd of 'hip' people, waiting to get paid and get the fuck home so he can go to bed and call me. 

i've had too much sleep. i need to make it more desirable by tiring myself. i feel like ive slept so much that i still could sleep even if i am well rested. i think it has something to do with those sleep chemicals that i haven't flushed out of my system yet. hmmm. all this talk about sleep is making me sleepy. 

night."

"event","Am I being naive by believing in true eternal love? Why is this something that is more rare than common in life? I feel as though the existence of true love has been deteriorating for the same reason our ability to enjoy the simple things in life has been deteriorating. Everything is so fast paced and people are so impatient with everything, it makes sense that our ability to love has suffered just as much. Why do we constantly crave new things, new people, new technology, new toys and gadgets when they just create more clutter in our already polluted lives? The ability to love someone forever comes with the ability to accept and appreciate the simple beauty in everything around us that we take for granted. What makes people so afraid of loving someone? If it is the fear of being hurt, well, doesn't everything about life hurt&nbsp; in the end anyway? If we keep our minds constantly in the past, we will never be able to accept anything in life because everything in the past has happened and there is nothing you can do about it.&nbsp; I've had my share of unfair treatment in the past, but I have left it in the past, and I don't let myself think about it or get emotional about it because it's already happened, and all thats left of it is what it's left in my memory. If i look at it this way and learn from my mistakes, I can move on and accept that it doesn't mean anything to me anymore. What means the most to me is the person I have found that I can see myself with for the rest of my life. I truly love this person and my love for him grows everyday because I appreciate the little things. This is what love is.&nbsp; The little things in life, the molecules everywhere, the trees, the sun, the moon is what makes me believe in love. It is patience and acceptance of what life is. Finding someone to accompany you as you accept life is so gratifying. Why would you ever want someone else? Boredom is not an excuse. We are all essentially 'bored' with everything, it is all in our heads.&nbsp; Becoming bored with someone is failure to appreciate their existence. The day I die I want to be able to look to my side and see that someone has actually witnessed my existence on this earth and that I have devoted to someone the most significant thing I could ever possibly find, my love and my life. And knowing that this person would have also devoted his entire life to me would be the only thing that I could ever appreciate in life. Love is why we are humans and not robots. Life without love is meaningless to me..."

"event","<font size=""3"" color=""#0000ff""><font size=""1"" color=""#000000"">Moving from one place to another was something I thought was vital to a person. I thought that changing environment and challenging oneself by making new friends and indulging in a new social scene would be something that makes people stronger and richer in character. Now, however, I feel as if I have become less intrigued by the thought of making more friends and meeting new people. I know my feelings stem in part from my decreasing ambition in life, however, I now come to realize that by the time we get to college, we have become quite consistent in our characters and personalities, to the extent that the new people we meet and relate with are not much different than the people we grew up with, in essence. I guess it may be related to the fact that we all have similar wants and needs and our goals in life seem to be similar in that we all strive to make the best out of our lives. <br /><br />I have mixed feelings though on how humans differ. It is such an amazing phenomena, yet at the same time, it is a sad one. The amazing part is that life can affect people in so many different ways, internally and externally. Genetics have a way of separating us apart, as well as our random experiences throughout our childhood, including family issues, friends etc. The randomness of life creates a great deal of diversity throughout humans, however, we are all essentially in the same boat. We all suffer the pains and horrors of mankind's shortcomings; racism, poverty, violence, rape, pride, prejudice, miscommunication, vanity, etc. Why can't we see these superficial differences and understand that we are all in this together? The sadness that prevails the phenomena of humankind's beautiful diverse character is that the diversity in itself (whether it is race, sex, culture etc) binds us to labels and distinctions that increasingly isolates ourselves from each other. Fear of being adversely affected by another human being is what makes the notion of defense so desirable. As we grow up, I feel like we are taught to create a defense for ourselves in terms of the people we associate with in order to live comfortably and unaffected. Everyone's heard their parents rant at least once about one of your friends and how you shouldn't associate with them because of your differences, or what not. In most cases, this is irrelevant, but, I do feel that sometimes it's best not to seriously befriend certain people because you don't want to adopt their distresses with their own lives and create more drama in your own life, that essentially, doesn't really mean anything.<br /><br />&nbsp;I guess what makes people strive to meet others is their boredom or confusion with their own lives and their necessity for drama to give them purpose. I just wish people could see that we are all the same! We just have different experiences and perspectives on life that make us seem different even though we are all humans and we all suffer. This is why I've come to the conclusion that I really don't have an actual need to meet more people, even though I can't avoid it, because I feel as though it's just excess drama in my already ridiculous life. Why should I indulge myself into the ridiculousness of a shit load of other people's lives when I have enough problems with my own? I do love hearing good stories and laughing with my friends, but I seriously don't feel as though I need any more people in my life. I feel like I have never appreciated the people in my life that I have always had and loved such as my family, and that is what I should focus my attention to, as well as a few other very good friends. I love everyone I am friends with now, but I don't feel like going out of my way to find more people to fill my life with excess drama. <br />I feel that people must accept the fact that we are all people and we all suffer the same pain of being something that is not either animal or robot... we are something so unique in this world that we can not explain the means of our existence. The best we can do however, is fill our lives with drama and other people to reassure ourselves that our existence at least preoccupies the minds of other people, and therefore we do have some sort of meaningful existence in life. I feel that I am selfish in that I don't want to relate with other people, but I feel like I already have in a way. I feel like we all have a world wide understanding of each other and suffer similarly the pains of life (knowingly or unknowingly)&nbsp; in some way or another. <br /><br />I am really glad I came here and experienced the people and lifestyle, but I realize that I need the solemn comfort of my hometown and my family. I can't handle the seriousness of an urban city right now, even though it's a great way to meet new and exciting people. I don't really want to meet anyone else right now, for my own good, and I feel like having some alone time in the town I grew up can bring back my ambition to create something out of my life. I feel the need to communicate with my family more than I ever have, just because I truly respect my parents, even though they too have their share of weakness. I love everyone I have become good friends with and I would never take back any experiences I have had here. I have learned so much about life and people that I can't handle anymore. I always thought that I would love living in an urban city but now I feel a desire to indulge myself into a calmer, less evasive, natural environment. I still appreciate the notion, however it is something I only needed to experience for a small amount of time. <br /><br />To conclude, I still feel it is good for people to change their environment and challenge themselves to meet new people, however, it is not necessary to overwhelm oneself with so much of one thing, and in this case, that thing would be people. I never really understood the phrase ""choose your friends wisely"" till now. You can't accept everyone that pops into your life. Drama makes life interesting, but too much of it just makes me want to vomit or poop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : D </font><br /></font>"

So yeah, I've come to a conclusive equation.  Here goes:  Ilene+E+rave=stay in bed sickness.  So, if I take one of those variables out of the equation, I won't get as sick as a dog (I don't like that expression, but y'all know what it means) for a week or more.  This time it wasn't strep, but I lived off of malt o' meal for 3 days.  I have consistently gotten sick after each rave I have been to, so I'm swearing off rolling at a rave for a long time.  I've been in situations where I've been awake all night and then not slept at all the next day and I didn't get sick, so I know it's not the sleep-deprivation.  Plus, there are dozens of other ravers who are holding up their heads the day after and they're fine, and I just can't seem to be feeling the same way.  Anyway, there are other things to do besides rolling, so next time I think I'll stick with Dark Lord...hopefully I'll be able to sneak some in so it won't wear off halfway through the night.  It's easy to sneak little things in when one breast is a B cup and one breast is a C cup.  LOL.  That's my plan for next time.
Downside: mom doesn't want me sleeping over at someone else's house for a while because she doesn't want to go through what she went through last time.  I forgot to call when I arrived and she stayed up all night worrying about me.  So that's my dumbass punishment.
Upside: I was in the company of some people I was very happy to see and spend time with, and I am also aware that the feelings were mutual with many.  I'm sooooooooooo glad that I spotted Jeff while I was in the caboose of the line, cause it would've taken me HOURS to get in if I had stayed back there.  Sharif is still a shitty salesman... ""T-T-T-T-T-T-TOBACCO!  FUCK YOUR MOM!!!  T-TT-T-T-TTOBACCO!!""  Hahahaha!!!  I think only Jeff will laugh at that one.  ""(singing) You, got what I neee-eeed!  But you say I'm just a friend.  But you say I'm just a friend.""  For some reason that just fits Sharif.  LOL.
Yeah, so then I reconnected with C.R.  Awwwwwww, he's such a sweetie.  A SWEATY sweetie!!  His sweat is really interesting.  It's not vile, it's just characteristic, I guess is how I can describe it.  I feel kinda bad not calling on Sunday like I said I would, but I didn't really feel like talking voluntarily at all since I kept getting sicker by the minute.  Hilary and Ed can vouch for that one.
Oh, poor Hilary.  Someone hacked $1000 out of her bank account a few days ago.  So, her boss said she could have a couple of drinks to chill out, and she had 4.  She got sent home from work for being drunk while on the job.  She happened to be at Ed's when I went to return my one-day-late videos, and she told me the whole story.  I helped her figure out her apology plan and she said I cheered her up.  I'm glad to bring cheer to someone's life, especially in the face of a nasty day.
I mooned my grandma last night and my mom thought it was funny.  Heehee.
Hmmmm, well I have to use the lavatory now, so I will catch up with all yous guys soon.  I hope I'm all better by next week so we can start having adventures again.

Any commercials to critic?  Ooooooh, does anyone remember that Ford Focus commercial where the car becomes a camera and it takes a snapshot of the viewers?  The effects were neat, but I don't think abstract car commercials are wise.  They're amusing, but since they aren't realistic, they're adverising something the car isn't capable of doing.  There's a certain degree of abstractness I approve of in a car commercial.

                             And now, some announcements.

Fletcher!!!  We need to watch one of these 3 movies next week (in addition to having an adventure): Magnolia, The Royal Tenenbaums, or Amelie.  We can watch more than one, but I'm saying AT LEAST one.

Trevor!!!  We need to have an adventure.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

Tanya!!!  I hope things are well with your health and school.  I hope things are well with people.  I'd like to see you soon.  :)

Vamir!!!  How's your room coming along?  We need to frolic.

Joe!!!  RETURN MY MESSAGES, OH GREAT SMOERCLEFF WARRIOR.

"event","As of late I have been updating very rarely due to many things.  One is that I have lost my fondness of the internet.  Two is that I have been juggling ISPs.  Another is that I have been very ill for the past week.  Monday was the first day it was really bad.  I couldn't really move, my throat was incredibly swollen and most of my muscles were sore.  All of this was a combination of lack of sleep and overexertion.  Saturday was my first day of true recovery.  I started eating again and I had some energy and the swelling was going down.  I'm still not back to normal, but I am mobile and off the codeine.  The pain killers never really did help, but the codeine helped me sleep.
Another thing that has been causing me to update is due to my excessive watching of the telly.  Every time I see a commercial that is either appalling or insanely amusing I feel like I MUST report it for all to at least have an idea of what I have experienced.  The latest sanction of worldwide grease corporations has been plastered by McDonlad's.  Here's how the commercial follows:

The setting is a middle-income house with a middle-income couple (possibly parents, but no kids are shown in the commercial).  The mid-age male is eating McDonald's while he is watching the television in the living room.  The wife walks by the room and tells him to put clothes in the dryer.  He agrees, but takes his precious grease with him into the laundry room.  He is greatly distracted by the programming on the television, so he is watching that while he is putting clothes into the dryer.  There are dryer sheets on top of the dryer, but there is also his McDonald's wrapper.  While he is distracted by the fabulous programming, he throws his McDonald's wrapper into the dryer instead of a dryer sheet.  Well, you can imagine how the clothes will smell when they're done....The wife is washing dishes (wearing a freshly-washed-and-dried shirt I might add), and the husband is walking through.  He stops, sniffs, sniffs some more, as if he's seeking out her desirableness.  She turns and they start making out, all because her shirt smelled like grease.  Bravo!  Wonderful commercial!!!

All I had to say to this (I was alone in the house, mind you) was ""What the fuck!""  Doubled over with laughter, I did not hesitate to come here and post about it.  *sigh*  I didn't realize they still made commercials this wonderful.  Wow I'm glad I live in America."

The gland in the back right part of my throat swelled up and has made it incredibly difficult for me to swallow ANYTHING (that includes even my own spit).  I've been on an ice cream/apple sauce/Ensure regiment and I'm hating it.  The only comforts are really cold things and sleep.  When I'm sleeping, I'm not dreaming and I'm not in pain.  Since I've been getting more food down today than before, I have the energy and the will to sit here and type this out.  Don't mistake it for the will to talk; opening my mouth is difficult, much less actually speaking.  I threw away my tooth brush and all my chapsticks (they had the bacteria).  No doubt this is because of my weekend activities, but that's not the only reason.  My system was not at it's strongest; I got about 2 hours of sleep on Friday night and 0 hours of sleep on Saturday.  I didn't even TRY to strengthen my immune system, so I deserved to get sick.  I'm sorry if anybody out there is feeling neglected.  Hopefully I'll be back to myself in a few days.

So the program offers to automatically fix it, so I decided to give it a try, see if it's too good to be true.  Well, it WAS too good to be true.  When it gets to a part where I have to type in numbers, it wouldn't let me type numbers in any way shape or form.  I had the numlock on, and nothing happened.  When I tried using the regular numbers, it would only type their capitals (ex: 818 becomes *!*) and I was not holding down the shift key!  It was so impossible.  So, after a minute of internally screaming at AOL, I quit the ""automatic fixer"" thingamajig, and try to sign back on.  Suddenly, my password is rotten, so I call customer service to have it reset.

Now, if I start to explain to him that it makes no difference to his energy bill whether it's on or off, he won't care.  He wants to be infallable.  He wants to be God.  He thinks he IS God.  I'm trying very hard as days go by to get him to see that he doesn't always have to be in control.  I do it more subtly, now.  I give him hugs for no reason, and agree to spend time with him even when I don't want to.  But maybe if I can get him to see that things are just fine if you let them be, nobody has to be in control for there to be order.  It's a tricky business, trying to open someone's eyes to a world they've chosen to ignore their whole life; or maybe he knew of it once and decided to shut it out because it was too much for his weak heart.  He's weakened it over the years, and has tried to fill his evergrowing void with all the shit he buys.  He fails to realize that the cure to his dying soul is right in front of him, right under his roof, our roof.  Unless he ever cares again to be in the world that I thrive in, as do the majority of my friends, no one can ever help him out of where he has stuck himself.  He has done all this bad shit to himself and he infinitely blames it on other people.  When he pretends to not blame it on other people, he feels that he had no control over his loss of control.  Or he makes dumb excuses for forgetting things, or not being mindful while doing something important.  The ever-popular, ""I'm tired"" might as well not be spoken; it means nothing to me.  Unless you are extremely exhausted due to lack of sleep or from doing an extremely strenuous activity, you should not forget to do simple things like checking the box to make sure they got your pick-up order right.  He chose a profession that allows you to sit on your ass all day.  He lives in his chair, at his desk.  He doesn't even WANT to TRY to improve himself.  ""Discontent is the first step in the construction of a man or a state.""  If you think you're perfect, you're not going to want to better yourself because you think there is nowhere to go from where you are.  If you realize that no one is perfect, including you, you will yearn to learn and always want to be improving yourself.  Those are the people who become the wisefolk that others go to for advice and comfort.  Those are the people who feel accomplished and loved.  Those are the people who want what they already have.  Woo, rambled enough for now."

"event","Well, last night was not a blast, but it was not as bad as it would have been had I stuck with my original plan.  You see, I didn't have any plans until I frantically called around December 31st to see who was doing what.  I got in touch with Sean and he invited me to come along to his gathering at his friend Robby's house.  Well, that was the first party I've ever been to where everyone had at least one drink.  Me, I'm not a fan of the drink.  The alcohol flavor is really gross to me.  It's so bitter and it just sits on the back of your tongue.  Now, I wouldn't mind ingesting alcohol if it didn't taste so awful.  So I tried a few things and took a shot of something peppermint-flavored.  It had a nice kick, but not too much.  I enjoyed it, but did not continue taking shots because I knew I had to drive home later.  So I've discovered that there are alcoholic beverages out there that I can enjoy, but I also learned that even though I really enjoyed the flavor, I have extremely awesome self control.  It was barely a challenge for me to not have anymore.  I'm so proud that it's come to that; come to the point where I don't even struggle with peer pressure or my own inner pressure to stop myself from doing something.  I'm so proud of me!!!  Weeeeeeeee!
I've had music from Pink's new cd running through my head for the past few days.  I'll be obsessed with it for another week probably and then it will become a part of my normal cd-switching routine in my car.  The new Outkast cd has already become a part of that.
The last note of this entry involves my father; it's not the usual, so that's a nice relief.  He asked me if I wanted to watch T3 with him around 12p.m. and I immediately said, ""No.""  But then I thought about my answer quickly after my reply.  I'm always trying to give him chances to improve/change/behave himself, and I'm in a fairly good mood today; so when I returned from downstairs I said, ""Actually, I WILL watch T3 with you.""  ""OK, I'll get it out of it's plastic.""  So we went into the guest room, a few minutes went by while I answered a phone call and he put the DVD in the player.  The movie started and about 10 minutes into it he already started going, ""Whoa!  That was neat!""  I glared at him and said, ""This is why we don't like watching movies with you.""  He then got out of his chair, and when he returned a minute later, his mouth was covered with scotch tape.  He groaned a couple times throughout the rest of the movie, but it was not of majorly annoying proportions.  So there IS hope.  Maybe there can be hope for Satan, as well.  You can teach an old dog new tricks, you just have to know your specimen."

I'm not in a ""nicely worded"" funk right now, so just pretend I said something satisfying and enjoy the hell out of yourself tonight.  New Year's Eve should be a night of loss of inhibitions, but not without precautions.  I hope everyone has plans to stay the night wherever they are or have a designated driver....even so, drunks are going to be on the road so I urge everyone to avoid being on the road anyway.  So, before I get to my complaints/wishful thinking, I hope everyone has a delightful, safe time tonight.

Most of my emails these days are spam.  I wish my friends would email me letters more often.  In fact, I should start doing that myself.  I do think about my friends ALL THE TIME, and sometimes LJ entries just don't seem personal enough.  Actually, LJ entries usually aren't completely personal at all.  I'm saving a load of time writing this general entry designed for my friends to read, rather than sending a thought-out email to each and every one.  What can I say, I'm lazy.  But seriously, if you're thinking about someone specific for an extended period of time, it's nice to let them know...to let them know they're loved.  I wonder all the time if people think about me.  When I go onto campus to visit my mom, I usually get bombarded by old HS buddies like I've been gone for years.  Even if they hug me so hard they make me spill my drink, I don't care about the soda at all.  It's wonderful to get appreciation like that.  *Sigh*  End of complaints commences.  Teehee."

"event","I've been through some shit since my last entry.  Don't really feel like reviewing it all.  Partly because I don't have any feelings left about anything that's happened that I need to express.  Basically, if you ask me how I am, I can truthfully say ""I have no complaints.  Life is good.""  I've come to a turning point in my world.  First of all, customers (whether they be knowledgable, dumb, or just plain assholes) no longer annoy me.  They just plain bore me.  My job doesn't churn my emotions, but I still enjoy it.  It's too hard to explain in detail, but let's just say that I don't come home from it in a bad mood or needing to take out my frustration on anything....because I have none.  Another thing that's changed: I am less and less intimidated by my father.  I used to lie to myself in thinking that he didn't intimidate me, when in fact, he did.  But for real this time, he doesn't that much anymore.  When he gets really pissed I'm on my guard for physical attacks, but when he throws a tantrum now it usually brings a smile to my face.  Almost everything he does in a tantrum reminds me of a little child, and children are funny.  Why, just the other night, he screamed at me not to tell him what to do, called me a ""mouth"" and repeatedly pointed at me in anger JUST LIKE A TODDLER.  Instead of me firing back, a wide grin took over my face.  That must've pissed him off even more, but there's nothing he can do about it.  He then proceeded to yell at my mother over something stupid like cookies.  It was very entertaining.  I had to strain very hard to keep from flat out laughing.  Hehe, it all brings a smile to my face now.  Well, back to a party that will hopefully not be as boring as the rest of the parent-planned ones are.  Goodnight everyone."

"event","A few precursors and then on to why I'm in such a joyous mood.

ROTK rocked a house fulla cheese addicts!!!  In boring English, it was fabulous.  I'm not a fan of war movies, because there's only so much fighting you can see, and then it gets boring.  At least that's MY p.o.v.  For others, TT was better than ROTK cause it had better/more fighting scenes.  I don't know and I don't care, but I'm so glad that it finally got summed up.  The first time I saw FOTR the ending pissed me off to no end, so you see, the end of the trilogy was very satisfying for me.
Fletcher and Penna came over last night after we (all 4 of us) had a ""nice"" family dinner just like old times and opened our first Chanukkah presents.  So around 8 the two of them arrived.  We mingled in my room for 30ish minutes and decided to find a nice smorking spot.  We traveled through Old Agoura for 15ish minutes, found a nice spot, and had a nice hit.  We went to see Ed and company.  We met Jeanine (sp?) for the first time and I was disappointed with her attitude but surprised by her looks.  I found her quite pretty.  It's such a shame she seeks attention so desperately that she uses her weaknesses as defense mechanisms.  Anyway, the night was such a blast.  Thanx guys.  <3

Tonight was the official family Chanukkah party.  I dread them because they're more boring than they are annoying.  I'd rather dislike something because I'm interested in disliking it than be completely bored with something because it's not worth my attention at all.  *sigh* Well it's over now, and I'm thankful.  Part of the reason I've always been fascinated with why Christmas Eve is so important is because I could never relate to being so happy to have a family gathering and sing songs and be lovey dovey and marvel at the ornaments....maybe Christmas was designed to be more fun than Chanukkah to get people to convert.  Eh, whatever, I'm not a holiday spirit kinda gal.  Never have been.  At least my dad didn't fail to beg for appreciation for the gifts he gave.
To fill you in on why this entry is called, ""JOYOUS JOY!!!"" I received a rice cooker from my parents tonight.  I can't wait to use it!!!  Steamed rice w/soy sauce is amongst my favorite snacks/side dishes.  It goes with almost anything and it's fine by itself.  You can drink juice, soda or just plain water with it (or booze for you alcoholics out there).  Yep, just the fact that I own a rice cooker has me in a good mood for the rest of the evenin'.  Out.

"event","I'm so happy that things work out the way they do...and the way they don't.  Well, it doesn't make me happy that things don't work out, but it makes me happy that they don't when I don't want them to.  It's hard to explain it to people who don't understand it already.  For instance: say you've been out with this guy/girl a few times and thought you were interested but now you just want out w/out strings attatched.  You would rather this DIDN'T work out, because you don't have any interest in being with this person in a relationship anymore.  I'm generally not a fickle person, but I find myself ending up with these guys that just don't emotionally and/or spiritually measure up to me.  The last guy I attempted to date seemed like a settlement rather than an adventure.  He reminded me too much of my brother, in that most things were a compromise where I expected that he expected something of me when he did something I wanted to do but he didn't want to do.  But if he doesn't TELL me in PLAIN ENGLISH that he truly doesn't want to watch a movie, how the fuck am I supposed to know?  (Vent coming on, prepare thyself).  I can't stand it when people say what they don't mean, and expect you to understand that they're just trying to be polite.  If you ask, ""Do you want to rent a movie?"" and the other person replies, ""I don't care.  Whatever you want,"" I expect that they honestly don't care and that watching a movie would be fine.  The message always comes clear w/my buddy Jordan.  It just didn't w/PJ...not at all.  So I rent a movie and go over to his house and we're watching it, and he keeps touching me.  (We're both high so I don't think anything of it until he starts putting some strength into his little grabs).  I lightly push his hands away EVERY TIME, but he doesn't get the message.  I pause the movie (which I'm trying to enjoy just for the pure sake of the movie, NOT making out to it) and ask him, ""Did you really want to watch a movie or do you want to mess around?""  Of course I don't get a clear and honest answer, ""We can watch the movie.  It's fine.""  ""You didn't answer my question.""  ""What?  We can watch the movie if that's what you want.""  ""But it's not what only I want, you said you didn't care.  Now I honestly just want to watch a movie and you're trying to make me feel guilty about not giving you some.  Well that just sucks.""  (He backs off, seemingly slightly insulted)  ""Alright alright, we'll just watch the movie.""  So, we watch the movie, and when it's over I say I want to leave because I'm feeling really tense about the situation.  A football game is going to come on, and he asks me to stay.  ""No, I really want to go home.""  ""I watched your movie.  You can watch a football game with me.""  Of course I'm fuming because of his deceit, but I let the guilt trip get the best of me.  I left at half time, very convinced that this relationship was NOT going to work.  I'm glad that I never called him and that he never called me.  It just wasn't a good match.  It was a desperation match.  Right now I want to focus on myself and who is good for me.  I surround myself with those who support and enjoy me.  Well, I try, anyway.  Each day I more strongly realize that I can never be perfect and have black and white definitions for my virtues and how I stick to them.  I can only do the best I can, but that is more than good enough for me, and that is all I need to know.  That should be all anyone would ever need to know for themselves.  Many just can't see it, and I feel sorry for them; but if they're happy with their possessive, shallow lives, then I am somewhat happy for those people as well.  Just don't get them anywhere near me.  Oh, wait, I live in so-Cal, it's impossible to stay away from people like that.

Well, Fletcher came over on Monday and we had jolly fun.  I ended up sleeping over at his house and had more jolly fun.  I'll be getting something in the mail within the next two weeks that I would like all Alcovians to see...especially Joe.  *hides face in shirt and mumbles Joeish*"

"event","It was MUCH better than I anticipated.  It took a lot of unexpected turns.  I like not knowing where the movie is going to go, and that happened a few times.  Good jaerb, people who made ""Bad Santa.""  Now for a long description of the last dream I remember:

I had a dream last night that I remembered directly after waking up, so I suspect it happened right before I woke up.  I don't remember many of the very specific details, but since I kept thinking about it throughout the day, some of the details stuck in my mind.
I was at a party at a friend's house and there were about 20 people there.  Everyone was friendly with everyone else, whether they had already known each other or not.  The house was on a San Francisco-like hill.  If you sat in the driveway and looked to your right you would have a clear view of the setting sun and a bit of the ocean.  The street had a pleasant feel to it.  Inside the house, most people were gathered in the main room, which was decorated with streamers, moving colored lights and bowls of assorted party snacks.  There was no alcohol, but there might have been some herb smokers in other rooms.  In this main room, however, it was just people talking, dancing or enjoying a soda or snack.  The environment was completely pleasant, and it wasn't very late in the day, so no one felt rushed to leave for their home.  There was something strange about it, though, even in the midst of all this comfort: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were there.  They were there as if they were just two regular guys sitting around at a party with their friends.  I never learned whose house it was, therefore I did not know how they were invited, why they were there, and who else they knew.  Another weird thing: it wasn't special that they were there.  No one paid them any special attention.  I didn't make a big deal out of it, either.  However, I did understand that I did not know them at all, so I decided to sit down next to Matt and talk to him, get to know him some.  Everyone was being friendly and getting to know each other, so I was doing the same.  So I sat next to him and we started talking.  Somehow our faces got really close to each other, and he kissed me on the lips.  My eyes remained open and his were closed.  Mind you, it was only a few seconds, but there was an effect.  I felt a really strong connection with him in those few seconds.  When he pulled his head away, he opened his eyes and looked at mine.  I put my hand on the back of his neck and pulled him towards me and we made out for a few minutes.  After that Ben nudged him and said, ""Let's get out of here.""  I was confused and slightly pissed off.  I couldn't believe he was just gonna leave me hanging like that.  From what I understood of the situation, Matt reluctantly followed Ben out of the house.  I followed them to see where they were going to go.  They walked out the front door and started walking down the street toward the big setting sun.  I rushed out to stand in the driveway to see where they were going to end up.  They walked down and across the street to a few houses away and sat in the driveway there.  I was still confused, so I walked down there and questioned why they had to leave to come sit on this driveway.  Matt started to open his mouth, but Ben cut him off and sternly gave me some sort of cockamame explanation as to why they had to get away.  After he was done I had tears in my eyes and heart and started to trudge back up the street.  It started raining heavily (of course, as if I were Zarthan) and eventually I began to crawl in the street with tears pouring down my face.  One of the buildings was not a house, it looked like some sort of motel.  There was a bunk bed on either side of the door covered in the blue material they use in moon bounces.  I crawled onto the bottom bed of one just to get out of the rain.  The door to the place was open, and the clerk standing behind the desk said, ""It's $22.90 for the night.""  I spurted, ""To lay in this bed outside in the rain?!  Forget it.""  I crawled back off of it and kept walking up the street.  It ended there.  Something that greatly confused me about the whole thing, I've never found Matt Damon especially sexy or anything.  I've always felt like if I did meet him he would be down to earth, but I've never ""dreamed"" about meeting him.  ""Dreamed"" meaning consciously and purposely wanting to meet him badly.  I'm not one of those people who freaks out when they see a celebrity.  I friggin' live in the L.A. area and I see them all the time.  They're just normal people like everyone else.  Yeah, so that about wraps up the tale of my unusual dream last night.  Most of my dreams are unusual, but some aren't, so I have to classify.
Maybe it was a wishful dream in that I want to meet someone down to earth who will be passionate about me and I am passionate about them.  I want to meet someone who will not criticize my oddities, accept me with my flaws.  When I call someone weird, it is a compliment.  When I say, ""You're such a dork!"" the words, ""and I love it,"" usually follow.  I love dorks.  I AM one!  I dislike ""cool"" people.  If you think you're hot shit, don't come near me.  See, there's a difference between you and me.  You THINK you're hot shit, and I KNOW I'm hot shit.  If you don't agree, you are weak and have no business talking to me.  I don't make friends with people like that, so if you're my friend, no worries.  :)
I get the sense that I'm better at making people feel uncomfortable rather than saying comforting things.  Eh, I'm not always smooth, so deal with it."

It's almost like when someone tells a seemingly funny anecdote, but no one can laugh because it's not a funny story.  It's one of those ""you had to be there"" things.  I know how much I can't stand wasting time listening to someone tell one of those stories and then have them tell me that they wasted my time knowing that I wouldn't laugh when they were done talking.  Well, the nice thing about LJ is that you don't have to read what you don't want to.  You are not in my presence, therefore you are not pressured to be polite and listen to me jabber on....because I'm not jabbering.  I'm not standing anywhere near you or talking to you on the phone.  Well, I've now lost sight of why I started writing the entry, but at least I've defined more of myself for everyone to know.

Maybe, but no matter how I'm feeling I'm always cheerful and friendly to tha customers.  Yay for me!  Some boring stuff is about to happen, so continue reading only if you want to be bored.
I started smoking again, kind of.  I don't feel addicted, I only smoke when I feel like it, as with the other stuff I smorke.  I've never been physically addicted to a chemical substance.  I have amazing self-control with what I put into my body.  So, I picked up a pack of Djarum blacks and boyyyyyyyyyyyy were they good.  Yeah, so that's a semi-new development, but it's not here to stay.  It's going to come and go, like it always does.
The other day when I asked for a smaller shirt at work, Lloyd gave me a small, but in LONG SLEEVE.  I get hot enough on the job in a short sleeve, so today I asked Gil (another manager) for a short sleeve small.  He's so totally asuma.  He's one of those people who you will never feel like you have to avoid.  If you see him coming your way, you will stay in his path just so you can exchange words or get/give a hug.  I'm flattered when customers compliment me on my knowledge of the products and stuff, but when they go on and on about it the harder it is for me to get them back on the subject of why they should buy such-and-such camera.  I fucking HATE that!  This is basically what I have to do: ""Thank you.  That's very nice of you to say.  Now, did you want me to pull this camera out for you?""  Now I look like an ass because I totally changed the subject right in the middle of that whole ""wow you know your stuff"" conversation.  The customer from heaven is someone who comes in, asks a few questions (perhaps asks which is the best camera in my opinion) and then asks to buy the one I recommend.  One of those customers came in tonight, and he was sold in under 5 minutes.  I was so thankful for his decisiveness (sp?).
The Lovatts were here when I got home.  Visited with them for a while.  They bought a brand new car.  That's amAZing.  They always buy their cars used, but not this time.

Just a side note: I don't work every day so if you go to Best Buy and don't see me, don't cry about it.  Either ask me when I'm working or don't have high hopes to find me there."

Recently, Lindsay was kicked out of her house after stopping attending her classes at Moorpark.  In high school, she was close to Gion and some of that gang, she also has a lil sis named Lauren.  That's as much as I'll describe her.  I feel very sorry for her, and wish her all the best.  Last I heard, she was living in a tent with her boyfriend in Malibu Park.  Her mother is here tonight playing mahjong, and I asked her in between games if she knew what her daughter was up to.  She said she is working at Ralph's.  I hope everything goes ok for Lindsay.
Well, those are my thoughts for now.  I stopped tripping a couple hours ago, but there's always a lasting woozy/weird affect that lasts for about a day.  So, signing off for now.  *makes walkie talkie sound*"

10:00a.m.-6:30p.m. today.  No one came to bug me.  Sad.  Tear.  Oh well.  I'll be too busy to groan about not being bugged on Friday.  I'll have customers coming out of my ears.  Ooo!  ooo!  I insulted my first customer today!  It wasn't intentional, he just took something I said the wrong way.  Dirty mongrel.  A British lady and her British husband came in looking for a camcorder for their daughter cause she's going to England for 6 months.  They ended up buying a small Sony one, and I hope she's happy with it.  The craziest thing, though: I couldn't stop wondering why this lady was wearing vomit green eye shadow.  Just couldn't stop looking at it and wanting to paint it anything but what color it was.  Then a few people with stankass breath asked for my help.  Bryan showed me a good tip for helper customers who smell: you take a step back but keep one foot out in front of you and just lean on your back leg.  They're not going to encroach past your front foot, so that gives you about a foot more of space away from their stank.  Complaints over.  Woohoo!  I love my gang.  Alcovians and alcovian regulars need to have an all-inclusive party.  Everyone who was ever there more than once needs to attend.  I think we should have it at the top of Mt. Fuji because a camera is named after it.  Random and useless thoughts deceased for now.
I met another Best Buy employee who loves HEDWIG as much and maybe even MORE than I do!!!!  I was sooooo excited.  We were talking about how much we hate TV, and I was like, ""Yeah, it's sometimes hard for me to agree on movies with other people cause I'm into non-mainstream stuff.  Like Ghost World, Hedwig-""  ""You like Hedwig?""  ""It's my favorite movie in the world.""  ""Oh my god!  John Cameron Mitchell is a GENIUS!""  ""I know!  And he's just so....ahhhhh!  And Miriam Shor...""  ""Yeah....[some cont'd convo about her]""  ""Yeah, I can't draw, so in high school when I'd get bored in class I would write the lyrics to 'Origin of Love' over and over again.""  ""Me too!""  And after about 5 minutes of heavenly chatting about Hedwig, I realized that I stupidly walked away with the keys AGAIN, and said I had to go.  He was like ""We'll meet up again.""  Before I left the break room, I asked, ""And you're straight?""  ""Yup, totally straight.""  I was like, ""I've never met a straight guy Hedwig-lover.  This is so happi.""  So yeah, that was a cool positive mark in my day.  Today was so positive all around.  Even with the few moments of complete hell and undeserved cruelty, the good parts definitely teetered the totter in my favor.  *sigh*  HAPPI."

"event","*singing in an operatic style*  Insomniaaaaaaaaaaaa, InsOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMNIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!

I have insomnia like a mo'fucka.  I seriously have not felt so awake and yet so tired at the same time.  I was laying in bed for two hours trying to relax and telling things to myself in my head like, ""Why can't you just fucking relax?!""  And I dare to wonder why I can't calm myself down.  How dare I.  Howwwww DARE I!
Anywho, I got my blue shirt today.  Offical Best Buy employee with a blue shirt, right here ladies and gentlemen *points to self and nods head expecting acceptance claps*  *Receives none and sulks in corner attempting to cocoon so as to hide from the rest of the world FOREVER*  Not really, I'm just being melodramatic cause I feel like it.  Don't like it?  DEAL.  Or, you could just not read.
That's a pet peeve of mine pretty damn near the top of the list.  People like to complain about the content of other's LJs.  Um....if you ever do this I will pretend to slap you and tell you to shut up.  Reading an LJ is nothing less than completely optional.  No one forces you to read anyone's LJ.  I often get a kick of how stupid some of them are, but I NEVER complain about these pathetics taking up precious LJ space (most of the previous statements were sarcastically spoken.  Inflect inflections appropriately according to my speech patterns).
Yeah, so I was hoping that staring at the computer screen for a while would make me genuinely tired and wanting to go to sleep.  Not that I don't want to go to sleep, but I really can't at the state I'm in.  Unless you've experienced genuine insomnia, you don't know what I'm experiencing.  I'm not trying to make a big thing out of it, but I'm just saying that I have experienced this so few times in my life it is that much more frustrating that it's hitting me a night before a busy day and two nights before a fairly early 8 hour shift.  Bleggggghhhhhhhhh.  I know there are millions out there who have insomnia every week, and some of them every night.  I feel so sorry for those people.  I feel sorry for most people, actually.  They just don't understand how empty their life really is.  And there's no way you can make them see unless they open up their heart to a world that they have never known.  That's the hardest part.  Allowing yourself to experience something that is completely unfamiliar to you is so difficult to fathom.  But once you're past the first part, the rest just gets better and better.  You form stronger bonds with those who share your ideals, your virtues, your beliefs, your passion.  These are the kinds of bonds that you can't get out of superficial relationships, much like the ones people tend to form in high school.  Kids are so desperate for acceptance for so long.  Some do grow up by junior or senior year and realize that their lives would be much more fulfilling if they went after their own dreams, instead of someone else's.  And even if they don't have specific dreams to follow, they can define what they DON'T want to do.
Listen to me, babble on about this shit like I'm a focking expert.  I'm no philosopher and I'm no expert, but this is how I relate myself to the past, present and future.  Third person is a must for me, I can not exist without it.  It would be like taking away my nitrogen.  Did you know that 79% of our breathable air is made up of nitrogen, and 20% is oxygen?  The other 1% is other gases, but most don't understand that most of our air isn't oxygen.  For some reason I found that fascinating when I learned it and it stuck with me.  There are many odd bits of information that have stuck with me over the years.  That's how my brain works.  If something strikes me as particularly interesting, I'll repeat the idea to myself over and over in my brain.  Every now and then the idea will pop up into my conscious out of nowhere and I'll be like, ""Whoa, I remembered that.""  Hehe, some insight on how my brain works.
When I was lying in bed earlier, attempting to fall asleep, I listened to lines from Hedwig going over in my head.  I didn't have to close my eyes to imagine the scene, the lips of the actors moving, the spoken dialogue, the almost-perfectly-remembered script of lines.  ""Excuse me, girl.  I sure don't mean to bother you.  My name is Sargeant Luther Robinson.""  ""My name is Hansel.  'He is silent for a minute while he stares at my little bishop in a turtle neck.""  ""Hansel (makes acknowledging frownish face).  Well, Hansel, you must like candy.""  ""I like gummi bergen.  Wow!  'The taste is much sweeter than a gummi bear, softer too.  Suddenly I realize the taste in my mouth.  It's the taste of power"" (makes noise as he spits the gummi bear out).
*sigh*  I miss watching Hedwig with those who enjoy it as much as I do.  I hate feeling like I have to explain myself or the movie to others.  I find I must do that with a lot of people.  So lately when I invite people over to watch movies I pick a mainstream one with no real meaning or symbolism.  Ahhhh, those are my favorites.  I can understand that a lot of people don't get as much of a kick out of a lot of movies I find hilarious or extremely moving.  Take ""A Mighty Wind"" for example.  Many people don't understand what to laugh at.  Folks, if you don't know you're supposed to laugh while watching this movie, it's not for you.  I know that a lot of people don't understand mocumentary humor, and I don't push it on them.  There's nothing worse than going, ""oh my gawd, we have to rewind that!  I think you missed what she said"" because I'm laughing so hard I can't understand why this other person isn't doing the same.  It's not always about laughing or even humor.  I just used that emotion and reaction as an example.  Hey!  Speaking of causality, who wanted to strangle the Frenchman while he was talking with a martini olive sloshing around in his mouth?!  Ooo, me, ME!  Pick ME!!  I know <lj user=""vamir""> does.  I'm pretty sure <lj user=""goddesskutani""> does, too.  Heehee.

So comes the end of my insomniatic rant.  Beautiful, wasn't it?  I'll get around to answering Kiki when she tells me what entry she's talking about.  Winc!  LOL"

"event","Well, it's been for-fucking-ever since I've written anything in here.  Posted quiz results, bleghed, complained, commented, ANYTHING.  I feel so incomplete.  Naw, not really, I'm just saying that to make you not want to read this entry cause it's really not worth reading.  In actuality, I'm attempting to save you time by warning you not to continue reading.  If you continue reading, it's because you can't take a hint and you belong with the crab people where no one can see you, hear you or communicate with you in any way.
The past however long it's been since I've written is a blur.  I know I'm going to confuse dates and the order in which things happened, so I'll be vague.  I've been thinking about people a lot whom I haven't seen or talked to in a while: Jorel, Melissa, Claudia (I saw her today, in person!), Nikki, Devon, Fletcher, Sarah, Darin (I saw him, too, but didn't talk to him), my grandma, my brother, the list goes on and if you're not listed and I haven't seen or talked to you in a while don't feel left out.  If you've made a big enough impact on me that you're sure I care about you, no worries that I do think about you.  I even think about people I DON'T like, but they're on my mind because they made an impact on me.  Some people I dislike do have a point about why THEY don't like ME, and I respect that they follow whatever they think is right...however, they are wrong in thinking that what they think is right.  For example: (this example is taken from <lj user=""Vamir""> and the context is changed, but he gets credit for the layout) if you're talking to a friend and commenting on how slutty some girl's skirt looks, and she overhears you, is that reason for her to bitch at you?  I think a lot of people forget that in the FIRST AMENDMENT, it says that U.S. citizens are allowed to express their opinions.  Her retaliation against such an opinion is misplaced and frankly, a waste of energy for her.  I'm sure <lj user=""vamir""> didn't think on this incident greatly once he had told the tale to a few of his friends.  I'm almost sure the sluttily-dressed girl made a big hoopla, as they like to do, out of a situation that she had coming to her.  Wow, this is turning into a weird, complainy, anecdotish entry.  Mmmmm my parents have been less bitchy lately cause I'm going along with their dumbass rules for a while.  I'm told they will be laxed up on some time in the future.  I still can't stand the fact that my father uses so many things in his life as excuses for being a bad parent.  All he has in his defense are lame excuses.  One of my favorites (direct quote):

You and Jerome never realized this, but for years I was worried that I might not make enough money to keep us in our home.  It was my dream to have a nice home, in a good area where my kids could grow up, go to school and we, as a family, could be safe.
 
    It is a dangerous world out there.  I have been able to
    shield you and Jerome from much of the evil in this world.
 
    I have always placed a lot of pressure on myself to succeed.
    The stress of trying to be successful, coupled with the
    insecurity of being responsible for the survival of my family,
    took a heavy toll on me.
 
    Again, these are not excuses for my behavior, just an explanation.

WRONG!  That's EXACTLY what these are.  EXCUSES!  I wouldn't hate him so much if he just fucking admitted that they're lame excuses.  But he won't just fully admit that he's wrong, or that he's a bad parent and there's nothing he can do about it.  It's like he always has to have control, and if he doesn't he flips his lid.  That's all I have to say about that.
I got a job at Best Buy in T.O.  I work in digital imaging.  Yay."

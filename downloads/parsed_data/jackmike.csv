I'm surfing around <a href=""http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/"">The Dope</a>, looking around Cafe Society and I discover that I am disqualified from any conversation because I don't know who the last 12 warblers on <i>American Idol</i> are, I don't know which member of the Fuckedifino tribe had to eat a live frog, I have no clue whose nuts Jack Bauer electrocuted with a desk lamp this week. And fuck me if I know a godmamned thing about lupus.

When I wake up in the morning, the very first thing I do is turn on the TV. Before I leave for work, the very last thing I do is turn the TV off. When I get home from work, I turn the TV on before I take my coat off. At night, what do you think the last thing I do is? Wrong, I leave the fucking thing on and just go to sleep.

Unfortunately, the only channels I watch are the ones that are extras. I could cancel a full 75% of my cable channels and get along just fine. In the mornings I'm all about CNN and Fox News. CNN for, you know, news, and Fox News because I love to see Steve Doucey act like a mincing little tool. At night, I'm all about the HBO, or IFC, or TMC, or Encore, or Reelz, or whatever movie is on. And I watch them all. Dig this, I've seen <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815244/"">Sydney White</a>, starring Amanda Bynes (and absolutely no one else you've ever heard of) at least 10 times. Ferchrissakes, I'm watching <i>The Perfect Storm</i> right now ... and I hate that fucking movie!

That and Caesar Millan and the occasional <i>Deadliest Catch</i>, and, of course, Red Sox games all summer long, and who has time to figure out if the stupid cheerleader has been save yet or not."

"event","Last night was our Road House gig -- a charity deal we were invited to play at.

The gig went relatively well. There were 5 other bands playing, and they were pretty good. 2 of them are working bands, so they were pretty tight. One other is reformation of an old working band, Northern Pride, so they were pretty good too. And one other band, was pretty good -- a blues band that benefited from a kick-ass makeshift horn section.

I don't know if I'd say we killed it, but we didn't suck. Mostly. It was just a little weird for me. I was very nervous all day long, but by gig time I was very Zen. And drunk. Not wasted, but feeling good.

We got up on stage and kicked into it. The first thing that was odd is that no one was dancing ... just standing there watching. We were the only band playing all original songs, so that probably had a lot to do with it.

Our set -- only 30 minutes -- was a bit of blur. I couldn't hear the vocals at all in the monitors or the PA except for a nondescript fuzz. I couldn't hear the keys at all, and he and his amp were right next to me. 

The first song, I couldn't even hear myself, and as it turns out, that was probably a good thing. I finally got to an acceptable volume level on the second song, but I was way out of tune. I don't know how that happened. Either I tuned wrong back stage (which is possible, but I don't think so) or I hit a tuning peg somewhere on the way to the stage (which is entirely possible as we had to navigate our way through the crowd to get to the stage.

After that, I did a quick on-stage tuning and all was good. 

I think we played everything roughly ten times faster than it was meant. There was a few mistakes in forms of the songs, but we covered up well, and I don't think I really made any mistakes. I was having fun. I had a whole section of the stage to myself -- it was a small stage, but I ended up with some room, so I could jump around and stomp up and down and all that cool rock and roll shit. 

There's one song we do where I start it bare, just me kicking into this little riff that runs through the whole thing, and the rest of the band comes in once I go through it on my own. During rehearsals we kept doing it differently, with Dave starting a count and me kicking in, or just me starting, and it was all kind of fucked up at the last band practice. So when the time came in the set list, Dave looked over at me and said, ""Mike, hand me my drink."" I was to hopped up to realize this, so it translated in my head as ""Go!"" So I did. Just fucking -bang-! loud, through this fantastic amp with an awesome clean sound I got to play through and I thought it sounded brilliant.

Over all, I guess we were a little sloppy. There was some weird ju-ju going on with a couple of the guys, but I was just trying to be loose and have fun. Next Tuesday will be interesting at the studio."

I got home from work last night and that's when I figured out that the heater was fucked again. So I did all I could do to try to fix it inside of the 15 minutes I had before I was heading out to meet some friends for a drink. Please note - ""all I could do"" should be read as, ""twisted, clicked and touched everything I could find before I just got pissed off and started raving like a complete lunatic.""

I called maintenance this morning again and told them that I thought it was completely pooched. It wasn't just a blown out pilot. In fact, one of my more heater-knowledgeable friends gave it basically the same diagnosis. They said they would send someone out to fix it. And they did. I have heat.

Here's the extent of the note they left:

""I replaced the pilot door gasket & fixed the sparker. It looks like the heater was kicked.""

It was funny, because I was still gooned out from the anesthesia and I had a little minor amnesia thing going on. I kept saying things like:

"event","I just not got back from the dentist -- from a 3:30 appointment -- and I learned something new about Novocaine. Apparently, for an upper tooth, the bone is so porous that they can target a specific tooth, and the numbing is just about instantaneous. The lower teeth do not have things so lucky. For lower teeth, they basically have to do an entire lower jaw nerve block dealio -- which needs some time to take hold. I did not know this.

So after my first Novocaine injection, I sat there and waited, and waited, and waited. I thought they had forgotten about me for a second. Luckily the dental assistant came in and flirted with me for a little while, so that was pretty ok. Then the dentist asked me if my lip felt fat -- it didn't really, but I didn't know I should have just said ""yeah"" -- instead, I got another shot, and some more waiting. Lovely.

The good news is that since I had a super-bonus dose of Novocaine running around my skull -- fuck it, let's do two at once. So I got two fillings in today ... and the entire left side of my face feels like an over-ripe grapefruit right now.

And then there's the bad news ... you see, about a decade ago, I had some pain in my jaw and what I knew was a horribly rotten tooth. So I went to the oral surgeon where he dutifully yanked out one rotten molar and three perfectly useless wisdom teeth. The fourth wisdom tooth he left in because, essentially, ""It's in there completely sideways; it doesn't hurt you and it's not going anywhere, so let's just leave it in there.""

Thank you Dr. Quackenbush.

Cut to now ... and lets just say that, ""I see a little pus oozing out"" is not quite the phrase one likes to hear from one's dentist. So I had to stick around for another pan-and-scan (or something) x-ray and a quick call to the oral surgeon. Now I've got another appointment tomorrow (for a surgical consult) after which, I will at some point be forced to agree to let some butcher hack some bone out of my jaw and yank one more of those stubborn fuckers out of my head for once and for all.

"event","So I just caught this movie last night on HBO, I think. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/maindetails""><i>Once</i></a>, about a heartbroken Irish busker who meets a girl who's also a musician, who encourages him to take his talent to London. The film takes place over a week, where they record a cd of his songs before he goes off to seek his fame and fortune.

It is such a fantastic film. The actors doing the singing and playing are the musicians who wrote and played the songs, so it's all authentic performances; there's no lip-syncing or fake-playing. And the songs are just so fucking good it makes you want to throw your guitar in the fire.

I'd heard a thing or two about it before - it won an Oscar for Best Song (2008 - ""Falling Slowly"") - but I never got around to seeing it. And now that I have, I'm smitten. 

I was out with the kids today shopping with all their accumulated Christmas gift cards and I was on the hunt for the DVD. I didn't find it until I dropped them off and made one last stop at Best Buy, so of course, I'm now the proud owner of my very own copy of <i>Once</i>, starring Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.

Now, here's the really cool part:

I was thinking about other Irish rock and roll movies, and mostly what I came up with was <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101605/""><i>The Commitments</i></a>. And there was just something in the juxtaposition of these two movies that gave me cause for thought, but I couldn't put my finger on it.

Just now, as I was looking up some trivia, I figured it out -- and the more astute among you may have already as well -- the guy that played guitar in the band in <i>The Commitments</i> is Glen Hansard. I fucking <i>knew</i> he sounded and looked familiar. And it's such a cool thing, because, let's face it, in <i>The Commitments</i> either he hadn't honed his craft yet, or his skill just wasn't highlighted, because his guitar parts in that film were basically pedestrian; and I don't think he sang a note in that movie. But you must hear this guy sing and play. He reminds me very much of Yusuf Islam, nee Cat Stevens, but edgier.

Cannot recommend this movie highly enough. 14 donuts out of a baker's dozen."

"event","Pursuant to my non-New Years non-Resolution, I've discovered a little service that was right under my nose that should help me be a productive member of the bottle recycling community.

I was sprucing up the joint a little on Saturday, but I couldn't get myself to get all my bottles together, down to the car, and out to the bottle/slot machine doo-hickeys. But I had two large bags full of plastic bottles ready to go. I figured I'd take them to the supermarket with me -- I was pretty sure they had some machines there.

They didn't.

What they do have is this program called ""Cylink"", which I deem pretty effing nifty.

Here's the deal. You buy plastic bags from them -- $0.20 apiece -- and jam your bottles in there. Then you affix a sticker, which has your account information in bar-code on it, to the bag. Then what you do is just drop it off at their little booth at the front of the store and ... walk away. No need to twiddle ones thumbs while waiting for them to count the bottles and definitely no standing there pumping bottles into a little hole in the wall hoping the fucking thing doesn't jam again.

Your returnable dollars just get credited to your account. At anytime, every day or once a year if you feel like it, you just scan your little card at their machine and you've got your balance right there -- you can drain it, or let it grow, whatever is easiest for you.

So the plan is this. Every time I go to the grocery store -- which is often -- I'll bring one or two bags with me. This represents the minimal amount of effort in preparation and lugging (no two or three trips up and down the stairs). I figure if I keep on top of things, I'll be just about on an even keel. First I'll have to stick with the program to whittle down the sheer number of empties I have lying around my apartment, but after that, I don't think I drain as many bottles as I would return in between grocery store visits. 

I'll be gold. Those friggin' empties are the bane of my neat existence (or at least a convenient excuse). 

There's actually a halfway decent chance that they'll no longer be an issue. Then I'll have to blame the cat for making me a slob."

So anyway ... I guess I'm making a New Year's Resolution this year, but only on a technicality.

I have tomorrow off. My apartment is a soup sandwich right now. The biggest obstacle I have to keeping the place tidy is the sheer number of bottles I manage to collect. I'll probably go through a couple of six packs of beer in your average week. And I drink Fresca like I'll die if I don't. Returning bottles is an effing chore. I live in a fourth floor walk up so just getting them all down to the car is a pain in the balls, and the only place to return them is one of these do-it-yourself places where you have feed them into the machine like you're playing the slots.

So my New Years Resolution, which is only a New Years Resolution because the day on which I've decided to start this practice just happens to fall on the first day of the year, is to bring back my bottles more often and therefore keep my apartment tidier.

So here's the thing ... I've constantly moaned about how all my friends are homebodies and live so far away and they never want to do anything. Then over the past year I made some pretty good friends here in the city, and we get together all the time for happy hours, and hang out at each other's places and do fun stuff together. So I figured ... sweet, finally I can make a New Years party plan.

They're all staying in because, basically they all have sig-o's and they're going to be bumping uglies all night. That and it's snowing like a mo-fo outside. And the only alternative (one that we exercise often) is to pub crawl down in the Old Port. Unfortunately, that means cover charges for our regular spots, when they don't usually have cover charges, and half hour waits for beers. Not that I wouldn't be willing to suffer through that, but I can't get my friends to hike up their skirts and join me.

Plan Z is that the new guy who I work with (the anti-Myron ... I'm actually starting to like this guy) tells me he has a friend in Manhattan who has an apartment right around the corner from Times Square and all it would take is a quick phone call and I'd have a place to stay if I were to go through with my annual threat of driving down to NYC on a wing and prayer all for the privilege of being one of those special few million that congregate for Carson Daley to moon at.

"event","And what a lovely little break it was. I took a little vacation time, did a little driving around, did some swimming, did some golfing, did some hanging out with the kids. All was well. 

But that's all over now and I'm back to work. Unfortunately, the pace has not yet picked up for me. All my old projects have been successfully transferred - if by successful you mean, I ain't gotta do them no more. Ask Queen Yada Yada if the transfer is successful. Christ she's such a whiner. I was down there earlier just to say ""hi"" and see how things were going, and she gave me this earful on my new bosses and how useless they are all for the sin of ... basically, not being willing to do her job. She is just so incompetent with most of what she does, that any little wrinkle ... like dealing with my old projects (which I guarantee I could teach any of you to cover in about an hour) ... causes her head to explode. 

Anyhoo ... I do like the new position, however, with bosses who aren't in the office but twice a week, and precious little training, there's not much cooking for me at the moment outside of fucking around with copies of databases in the hopes that I'm doing something productive.


But that's not that important.


Not too much going on lately. I got a call from the Athletic Director of the school I coached at last year wondering why I wasn't at the coach's meeting last night and whether or not she should contact her back up for the position. This all struck me in much the same way as I might be struck if my English teacher from 11th Grade had called and asked me if I was prepared to present my book report on <i>Silas Marner</i> this afternoon. 

I told anyone willing to listen last year that I wouldn't be able to do it this year. I informed the admin at the school when she sent out coaches questionnaires in the spring that I wouldn't be able to do it. So now I get to call her up today and basically throw her into total panic mode. Eh, whaddayagonnado? There's no way I'll be able to get all that time off to coach this year. Which is also a convenient reason to give to my sister as to why I won't coach my nieces soccer team -- for free! It's like herding cats ... no thanks.


But that's not important either.


What is important is this ... how many days is it until the first Vice Presidential Debate? Because I am going to curl up in front of the TeeVee with a nice big bucket of popcorn and laugh my tree-hugging ass off. Or maybe not. I have a feeling it will be like watching the neighborhood tough guy making your little sister cry.

Ok. A little over the top? Maybe. Counting my chickens? Perhaps. But really ... who the fuck is Sara Palin? Has anyone, outside of her own family, ever heard of her before last week? Outside of the fact that she seems utterly unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency, she has more baggage that Paris Hilton on a European vacation.

The thing that puts the chuckle in me the most is the 'shoe on the other foot' prism that I like to sift things through. Lets, for a moment, imagine that Joe Biden (or any Democrat for that matter) had a teen-aged, unmarried, pregnant daughter, and that his spouse had been a member of a separatist political party, and that he was under an ethics investigation. Then I imagine Ann Coulter would be talking about more than how he cribbed two lines in a speech 20 years ago. In fact I think the phrase ""slut who can't keep her legs closed"" would probably appear in the first paragraph of every piece she wrote. If Sara Palin was a Democrat Rush Limbaugh would be howling like a retarded monkey. Hannity would be burning her in effigy. Malkin would be scrawling and scratching about family values so hard her talons would crack.

Oh the Republicans are putting up a brave face. But I guarantee the phrase most uttered by Republicans last week was something along the lines of, ""What the fucking fuck?""


Here's my take on her preparedness:
She's governed Alaska for 1 year and 9 months. She was mayor of a town of about 7000. Now I come from a small (population-wise) rural, mostly wilderness state. And I lived in a town of about 5000 for most of youth and young adulthood. I've seen the sort of people who manage shitty little podunk towns in the middle of nowhere, and I've seen the sort of home-spun good ol' boys and girls that rise up through the ranks of the political. 

There's no way I would vote for any of those bumpkins for President in a million years. I'm willing to bet the political machine in Alaska is quite similar.


In summation: McCain is an idiot."

It seems that some people have been offended. They have been duped and they are not happy about it.

In fact, nothing claimed in the initial story seemed to be true, and the general public is in upheaval.

There's nothing bone-fide and/or legitimate about the claim from two Larry The Cable-Guy fans regarding the nature of the American Yeti in their double-wide? What about the Mermaid back in the creek, or the Unicorn down in the root cellar? Are you telling me they aren't real either?




How fucking stupid is this country getting that this even causes a ripple in the news cycle. We might as well trash The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal altogether and just go with The Weekly World News.

I have a new toy ... sort of ... I was playing with it until the wee hours.

On Monday I went out to Buckdancer's (music store) to window shop and mess around. This place is really cool; they not only allow you to play any instrument you want, they practically insist on it. I was playing a $2500 Martin acoustic that sounded like Yaweh himself tuned it.

In the end I only picked up a new set a strings and new 15 foot cable to use up at the studio. I decided to bust out my Les Paul and see if I could get it in decent playing order. Good news -- I could. I was wailing on it on Tuesday night, and yes it sounds very good. I think it still has a few issues regarding nut placement and pick up height and all that good stuff. This is the guitar that my dad re-finished for me and put back together himself as well as he could figure. He's a pretty good craftsmen, but no luthier. I digress.

So while I was in the store I wandered by the Heap O' On-Sale Shit and saw this effects peddle for $70. it's an RP-80, if that means anything to anyone. It's nothing special, but a neat little rig. Its got 80 tones and you can edit each tone with choruses and flangers and delays and amp styles and all sorts of shit.

I didn't buy it. However, it turns out it's the exact same model that a friend of mine has and he lent me his to mess around with -- to sort of demo it.

I was up until 1:00 last night putting on an (earphoned) psuedo-Phish-Dead-Pink Floyd concert in my living room. It's got a drum track thingie to it that has 30 different rhythms. That along with a nice fuzzed out, over-driven tone and a delay set to the beat, I was getting some pretty funky shit out of it. It was fun. I'm going to have to buy one for myself.

Last night when I went out to my friend's house in Scarborough to pick up the pedal, I did something I haven't done in about 4 years.

So I'm a man without a country right now. I'm in my old cube where, besides a computer a phone and a chair, the only think in here is me. I did manage to get a few things done regarding transitioning out of my old position, but I've got nothing done in my new position. I couldn't even get the laptop they gave me to talk to the network.

So fuck it. I say, let's drop back ten and punt. While I have some discretionary time today, I decided I needed to have my car fixed el pronto. I just couldn't wait for Friday (where I had an appointment at my local garage) so I decided to give Meineke a shot. Sure they can take a look at it this afternoon. Great ... I'll do what I can to get it there.

And therein lies the tale. My buddy Shawn gave me a ride down to my apartment, and ostensibly was going to follow me to the garage and bring me back to work. Didn't quite work out that way. I started to move the car out of the driveway and sure enough, the brakes locked up. I put it into reverse to unlock them, like it did before and ... they locked up again.

Basically I was stuck right in the middle of my driveway, brakes completely locked, can't go forward, can't go back, I'm blocking the entire parking lot. FUCK!!

I called a tow truck. I did manage to unlock the brakes enough to coast it down the driveway and stop it with the e-brake so he could get it up on the bed. But somehow, the dumb fucker locked the keys in the damn thing. So once we got to the garage, the first thing he had to do was to spend 20 minutes with a slim-jim trying to break back into my car.

Jesus H.

So right now, I have no idea what this is going to set me back, outside of the 75 clams for the tow. I'm betting I'm going to be utilizing the old emergency credit card for this one. Double-fuck!

And again, I don't think it's fucked too badly, but just enough to where I'll have to spend money on it I didn't want to spend, and also fucked enough to where I can't drive it until I get it fixed, and I can only get an appointment for it for next effing Friday. Which means, Operation Weasel My Way Into The Band will have to be on hold for at least a week.

There's a slim chance I might be able to get it looked at on Monday, but then I'd either have to drive it further than I'd like in its state, or pay to have it towed.

It's an issue of breaks. Apparently I've got a worn or dirty cylinder or something somewhere that essentially makes my rear passenger side break drum pop open at random. I was driving home from work last night and it locked right up on me. Luckily I was only going about 30 miles an hour. It didn't send me out of control or anything, just made me stop when I didn't want to stop. I got it unstuck and managed to drive home with no further incident, but this morning it locked up on me twice just trying to get out of my driveway. So, I'm bussing it for my first week of work at my new position next week. Oh perfect.

I don't want this to happen, much as I didn't want the Garciaparra flap to go down either, but look how that turned out so what the fuck do I know. But I figured Manny would pull his usual contract year whining and limping around and playing like an asshole for a few weeks. Then figure out that he was un-tradeable and come back and start hitting home runs after July 31st. Then I figured he was gone anyway via free agency at the end of the year.

But this looks serious. There isn't a commentator that isn't predicting this is all but a done deal. Even the Rem-Dawg says he's gone, and, says Jerry, ""Good. I'm sick of him"" (I paraphrase).



The only saving grace is that the likely trade will involve the Red Sox getting Jason Bay and a pitcher from Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh getting prospects from the Florida Marlins and Florida getting Manny. Manny Ramirez in a Marlins uniform will make me giggle. Yes, I know they won the series a few years ago, but that was a rig-job - bought and paid for. The Marlins are still an expansion squad as far as I am concerned and I can reach back for some hidden bile and say that it serves Manny right. You bitch and moan and end up leaving one of the greatest and most storied teams in the history of sports to go play for ... the fucking Marlins.

I am very encouraged by the, so far 2-week, progress I've had re-inserting myself into the band. If you may recall, when I first moved back from California I was living with my sister and her husband (Dave, drummer for the band) and as a result, I'd join him down at the studio every week because ... what the hell else did I have to do? At the time, there was contentiousness between he and I, mostly arising from the fact that I was sleeping on his couch for four months. So, I managed to weasel my way into the band - maybe not officially but at least tacitly. Then I moved out and pretty much just stopped going up there. In the five years since, I've gone up a few times but not ever steadily.

Cut to last week, second week that I started going back, where I sheepishly asked if I could sit in. Sure! Great.

Cut to this week where before I even had a chance to think about asking if I could sit in, Michael told me to grab a guitar and plug in.

I can't lie. I didn't play everything perfectly, and there were a few songs where the best I could do was to latch onto a few notes and try not to butcher anything too badly. But there were other songs where you would have sworn we had rehearsed them endlessly. Just tight, anticipating changes and stops and all the quirky things that they throw into their arrangements, complete with balls-on finales. 

At one point, Dave jumped up from his seat and exclaimed, ""Why the fuck aren't we playing this in front of 1000 people right now? That fucking rocked!"" High praise indeed from Dave, who I think always had seen me (and still sees me) as just sitting in, and not a proper member of the band. But I was the glue in a lot of the shit we laid down last night. I know I impressed Dave when Michael just wasn't getting what Dave was explaining for one arrangement, but I did and drove the song with it. 

When I was leaving, I told them that I was really hoping to keep up the habit of coming down on Tuesdays, which was responded with a hearty, ""always glad to have you play with us.""

I am pouring sweat.

I have no air conditioning. I have a window fan.

I also have a six pack of Newcastle.

The Red Sox - Yankees game starts in 45 minutes or so.

This is what you call a fine Saturday. If only all my friends hadn't flaked out on me. 

Eh, fuck it. Their loss.




I'm also going to see <i>The Dark Knight</i> tomorrow with the kids, so I even have that going for me."

"event","Red Sox Yankees tonight ... and I'll be curled up on the couch watching, thinking nice thoughts for my liver, because Buddha knows I've been putting it through it's paces lately.

Tuesday night I went down to the Studio. My brother-in-law's band's studio. They still do the Tuesday Night Music Club every week and, damn it, it's fun. It's turned into quite the little club house. There's a standard crew of regulars, only some of whom are musicians. And we all hang out, drink Allagash White on tap (they have a keg fridge), smoke the kind, and jam. I've only recently started going back to hang out, and this week was the first night I had the gumption to see if they could set up an extra amp so I could sit in. I was having a hard time keeping up with some of the songs as I hadn't played them in forever; they are all originals and, while not overly complicated chord-change-wise, it's easy to get lost holding the rhythm parts together when Michael goes off on a solo. Not to mention, I have to hope someone will give me a nod or something to cue me for any weird breaks or bridges or whatever they throw in there.

At any rate, I'm definitely going to keep that a habit for at least until the weather goes south on me.


Wednesday night I invited the guy who's job I'm taking out for a beer. He's moving back to Chicago to go for his master's degree so it's not like he got fired or anything. He lives right around the corner from me, so he and I and another guy from work here just hung out at this corner pub in our neighborhood for four or five beers and shot the shit.


Last night, I originally made plans to hang out at Alive at Five (the summer concert series held outside downtown), but it was canceled due to inclement weather. Instead, I met up with Jaclyn (the aforementioned super-hottie) and a couple of her hot friends. Those people can pour it down. I arrived at this new brew pub in the Old Port and immediately ran into yet another former cow-orker who used to date one of the dudes I was hanging out with on Wednesday. So I immediately thanked the Karma gods that he had his kids last night and couldn't join us -- that would have been an ugly scene. She gave me all the low-down on what a fucking asshole he is and it was actually a little uncomfortable because he's a relatively good friend of mine. But that's fine. I let her vent.

This place hosted the shittiest service I've had in quite a while. Toward the end of the evening I waited five minutes for a beer I'd ordered and when I tracked down the waiter guy and told him to cancel it because we were leaving, he said, ""I can't; I already rang it through."" Then I had to wait another five minutes to actually get it. But long story short ... I managed to get pretty buzzed before we went off to Gritty's to get something to eat because the only thing this place served for food was cheese plates. What kind of communist organization is this? Onion rings! Goddamnit, I demand onion rings!


Walked home in the rain and slept on the couch. 

I woke up this morning and felt like Shakes the Clown. The only thing missing was Florence Henderson.


So, even though I'm invited out again tonight to tie one on at the sports pub, I think I'll pass before my liver defects and runs away to a detox clinic without me.


And speaking of the Yankees ... is it just me, or does Joba Chamberlain look like he should be sitting in a bathrobe in a mental institution on a thorazine drip?"

"event","Well, I'm just having a pretty good goddamned day for no good goddamned reason.

And it's not like anything earth-shattering is going down. It's more like, nothing earth-shattering is going down and that's a good thing.

You see, I was re-reading some of my old journal entries. I didn't go all the way back to 2001 as that would have been far too depressing. No need to re-live the portion of my life where I was being played as the biggest patsy since Lee Harvey. But I was going through the parts right after I started work here at the bank and I noticed a few things.

Yeah, I was still pretty depressed, stagnant and loser-ish but damn it if there's isn't some funny-ass shit going down in these virtual pages. This was when I hated my job ... or my career (or lack there-of) ... and I had tons of time to update my journal, comment on others, create polls, run with the rolling jokes, etc. This was quite the little playground for me, and I daresay for a lot of others too. Sure there are the bouts of ""isn't Marion a cunt"" and ""Alice really fucked me over"" and ""Myron pisses me off"" and all that good shit, but I really like reading all my old stuff. I was particularly enjoying the Scarborough Slobs saga, complete with Guido the Pimp and the Urine-soaked Chicken Salad Sandwich - which by the way would make a great album title.

I always think somewhere in my mind that I'd like to write a book. Fiction. Memoir. Commentary. Something. But lately it has occurred to me that I think I already wrote one. This journal is a pretty interesting and funny read, in my opinion. I think with a little editing, discriminating entry selection and a healthy dose of additional prose explaining various esoterica ... well, I guess I think it would still be a pretty good read.

And then there was a comment on one of my many, ""I'm broke and my bedroom is too small and my roommate is a redneck"" posts where someone said (I paraphrase), ""I can't wait till you can look back on all of this and smile,"" the gist being, hey, I'm sure we'll all get through this.

In the meantime, five long years later, I still have the same job -- well with the same company -- and I've actually managed to make something out of myself here. I've got my own kick-ass apartment and with any sort of non-fucked-uppery, maybe even a house within a year or two. My official divorce is nigh. My circle of friends is ever growing. And I might even have a date set up in the very near future.

I'm not pretending that I now have everything figured out, and I reserve the right for future ""I hate my life"" entries ... but what a difference a half a decade makes, huh?



On top of everything else, I have just procured for myself a genuine red Swingline stapler. Does it get any better?"

"event","Regarding <a href=""http://jackmike.livejournal.com/962831.html"">The Great Hard-Boiled Egg Experiment of Aught-Eight</a>:

At this point I think I can qualify the experiment as a success ... barely. You know what it got? F+ ... click!

I did up four eggs -- four eggs for a reason. You see I had just been to the grocery store where I procured, among other things, an even dozen eggs and a pack of super-sandwich-sized english muffins, with the idea toward egg-a-muffins. Here's the thing, the muffins come four to a pack. So once I'd gone through the muffins via the single-egg egg-a-muffin route, I'd have eight eggs left over ... sitting in the refrigerator ... mocking me. Unless of course, I do three eggs to the sandwich, but come on now ... what am I, a rat-snake? Who needs three eggs on one sandwich -- two being the count of eggs for which any self-respecting egg-a-muffin eater requires. 

So what does that all boil down to (no pun intended)? I don't know, because I've completely lost track of what I was talking about, but I do know that I did up four eggs last night.

First of all, one of them was a floater. I almost disqualified this rogue fucker right off the bat just on principle. On the other hand, it's good that I discovered this ovum character flaw now, instead of when I went to crack into a pan and a half-dead bloody chick came oozing out or something.

That floater did not work and play well with the other eggs. By the time I got around to remembering I was boiling eggs and that I should probably turn the burner off, it had cracked. And the goop inside had oozed out some and started to set, but not quite. The result was essentially an egg sporting a goopy white mohawk. I wasn't about to open that fucker up and see Frankenchick in a silent scream like some awful Roe v Wade for poultry case. Right into the hopper that defect went.

As for the other three eggs ...

... first of all, I wasn't happy with the yolk distribution. I live in a world where the yolk is always ... <i>always</i> ... dead center of the egg. There is no other alternative. Do you not watch <i>Looney Tunes</i>? Need I say more? But my yolks were all off-center to the point where I could see the yolk about a millimeter under the ""skin."" This did not make for easy eating. You go to take a bite thinking you're getting the required ratio of white to yellow and you end up with a mouth full of yolk with hardly a whit of white to compliment it. 

But second of all ... I forgot that I don't really like plain boiled eggs that much, and deviled eggs are waaaaay above my skills. They were extremely bland, and I didn't have any salt to pour on them. I was considering Mrs. Dash or perchance a dash of Tobasco, but by that time I was whipped. I only ate two of them and threw the last survivor in the fridge for a potential egg salad at some future date, which will no doubt throw a monkey wrench in my egg-a-muffin algebra, but I shan't be daunted. 

Or next April I'll throw it out once I remember that I put in there to die a slow horrible death. 


Either way, I win. Fuckin' eggs."

Now I'll be tasked with the transition, and won't that be fun - transitioning all my current stuff to someone, and transitioning all the new stuff while transitioning the old stuff ... it's going to be like working two full-time jobs at once for about a month or so.

I officially start August 4. It's almost enough to piss me off, in that my new boss had said he'd like me earlier. My old boss said, ""we have to have him for at least those two weeks."" The thing is though, it doesn't matter who <i>has</i> me, I'll still be overlapping ... so why not make my start day now and let me reap the benefits of the bigger paycheck? 

Anyway ... it's all good.


Went out for drinks and a baseball game with some product people last night. That was fun. The drinks were paid for unexpectedly by one of the muckity-mucks, so I didn't feel so bad for spending $20 on 3 beers at the ball park. Sea Dogs lost; they suck. Big Papi is supposed to be in town doing a rehab stint with the Sea Dogs, but unfortunately it seems he'll only be starting on that next week. I thought we were going to get to see him last night. Either way, it should be interesting. If his wrist is even half-way healthy, he's going tee-off on Double-A pitching like it's batting practice.


I had another pseudo run in with that homeless guy I caught sleeping in our basement last month. I get to the ground level heading out into the parking area this morning and there's a bundle of blankets stuck in the door jamb, wedging the door open. ""What the fuck?"" I say to myself, as I am wont to do. So I kicked the blankets out, threw them in the hallway in a huff and went about my merry way. As I'm getting in my car, who do I see but the same loser (who was wearing a Yankee's hat, so doubly fuck him) walking up the driveway to the back door. When he saw that not only did I block his entry to our building, but I locked his shit inside, he didn't have a very pleasant look for me. 

Eh, fuck him. We're not a homeless shelter. Listen, I have as much empathy as the next guy. If he'd asked me for a dollar, I'd probably give him one; if he needs a ride to the homeless shelter I'd probably do that too. But I'm sick of this squatter claiming my ""secure"" building as his. And if his bullshit ""I had a fight with my girlfriend"" story is true, then get her to give you a key. No more free rides from Rush Batty over here.


Speaking of Rush ... seeing they're back on tour, and mentioning it in the group last night (some of whom are youngster types) was met with this gem, ""Aren't they that group who sings about computers?""

I'm not even sure what that means, but I just replied ... ""Yes. Yes they do.""


Anyhoo ... I can't wait to start my new position so I can start looking down on the little people."

See, I'm over forty, so that means, by law, I'm required to listen to talk radio when in the car. Sure, I surf past WBLM (Maine's Rock Station since 1972), or WCYY (Maine's Alternative Rock Station since 1992), and occasionally WCLZ (Maine's, um, other rock station since sometimes or another), but for the most part I'm an AM guy.

Bob and Tom in the morning. Funny show. It's mostly interviews of comedians, with your basic radio skits and celebrity impersonators and shit. There's not so much of the, ""say, let's go outside and see how Danger Boy is faring offering strangers massages while dressed in a chick outfit."" However, I generally only get to listen to about 10 minutes of it every morning, and I'd like to hear more. I don't, however, wish to spend $15 a month for the privilege.

Instead, I download The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_O%27Meara_Show"">Mike O'Meara Show</a> pod-casts. That's my afternoon drive-time show. It's funny too. And they have Rob and Buzz. This is the remnants of the Don and Mike Show once Don Geronimo retired. I was afraid Mike on his own was going to suck, and he did for the first week, but he and his crew have stepped up big-time. I'm loving the new show. Mike was always second-banana/celebrity -impersonator-guy so stepping in as host was a stretch. But he's got that show running slicker than whale snot. Tune in, you'll enjoy.

--------------------------------
In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Northwestern University. 

On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air.  The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. 

He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.  As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.  The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments.  Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled.  Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.  Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day. 

Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son.  As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing.  The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man. 

Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant.  Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure.  He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder.  The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly. 

Probably wasn't the same elephant. 

  

This is for all the people who send me those fuzzy, heart-warming bullshit stories."

"event","A long buried memory came back to me just today, regarding the whole desecrating the Eucharist flap going on.

I grew up in a very small town, in which the majority of the population was not only Christian, but Catholic. I'm talking to the tune of probably 95% or more. In the mid 1970's Catechism was offered in public school. That's how Catholic this town was.

Now my family was one of the 1%'ers; actually my dad was raised Catholic (he lapsed long ago) and my mother was raised Lutheran (as in, 'say it's Easter, guess we'd better go to church'). I was raised essentially a-religious. Neither atheism, nor agnosticism was offered as opposed to the fact that there was just no religious training for me and my sister whatsoever.

However, when one is an impressionable young lad, one tends to do shit his friends do. So, yeah, I went to a few Catholic masses in my youth. I never really liked it at all. I either found them excruciatingly boring, or down-right intimidating. Mostly the intimidation was sort of by osmosis; I would be there next to a buddy, or a cute girl whose affection I was vying for or whatever, and if didn't kneel, or stand, or sit, or jump up and down, or whatever it is they do, I got the immediate ... {gasp} - ""you're not doing it right"" accompanied by the hand on the arm slamming me into whatever position I was supposed to be in, while hoping mom and/or dad hadn't noticed what a little heathen Johnny or Jenny's little friend was being.

And then there was the Communion ritual. I didn't know what the hell to do, and truth be told I was a little embarrassed of going way up front where everyone would see me not knowing what to do. I remember asking my friend ahead of time things like, ""Do I have to do Communion? What do I do? What line do I get in? Do I have to say something? When do I kneel? Is it really wine? Do I just stick out my tongue or open my mouth or what? Am I supposed to close my eyes?""

What can I say, I was a little neurotic when I was a tween.

The upshot is that I remember specifically being told that I could just hold out my hand and the dude would give it to me. So that's what I did. But still, I wasn't sure if was supposed to eat it right there or take it back to my pew, or what. Essentially, I just took it, held onto it and followed my friend back to the pew, where I took a little nibble and realized that it was disgusting. It was like chewing note book paper. I stuffed in my pocket.


And when I left, without even knowing, I kidnapped Christ. And then I threw him in the garbage can in my kitchen.


You don't want to fuck with me.

"event","What? uhm. So I got mad at someone for something they did to me. And then went off and told me about how they think thats pretty dick to do to someone. I was kinda pissed. But I didnt say anything. I cause too many problems anyway. They dont read this journal I dont think so if your reading this its probably not you im sorta down about.. I dont like people much, including me.. Theres a few people that are good. And I appreciate them. Lets see. I made high honor role this marking period. Im kinda proud of myself. Needed an A average to get it. Sometimes I'd like to lay down and just stare at the ceiling. And not bother a person. I seem to bother people. I seem to do stuff wrong a lot. Id like to unexist. to feel the sweet sensation of sleep all the time."

2) Spnaish I dunno anyone in the class.. they are all sophmore and freshmen except for two other junior chicks that one I never even seen before. And I just plain hate spanish.
3) History.. fun kids.. but the teacher is monotone so I fall asleep.. and within the weeks I havent learned a single thing yet. 
4/5) Comp Science.. wow.. only good class this year that interests me.
Lunch 6.. its alright.. crowded at my table though.
7/8) Chem.. hmm.. its not bad.. teacher gives out too many quizzes though..
9/10) Health is gay.. no one cares.. who gives a fuck.
11) English.. the class smells like ass every day.. and the janitor came in and was like.. I dont smell anything.. fuck it.. you know you do.. everyone does.. but you get use to it.

So school suck.. so I come home and wait until my bro gets up then I can drum..

US History II: Ummm.. Decent class.. two of my better friends in it switched out though.. so it kinda sucks.. Teacher is boring.. makes me want to fall asleep.. So, so far.. I do sleep.

Computer Science: Like the subject.. teacher is chill.. Not too good friends with many of students.. and the few I am I dont really like that much.. We take too many notes.. and so far the teacher dosnt teach.. It'll get better when we actually start programming.

LUNCH: Fun lunch, table is CRAMMED though. I only know like 2/3rd of the peoples names.. but they know mine cause of dana and pat.. Still, great lunch.

Chemistry: Its not bad now.. It will get better.. There is too many awesome kids in their.. me, Nick, Sarah, and Wes are in like a group..

Um.. Two nights ago? I think.. or last night.. not sure.. dont remember.. I went to my grandparents house for pizza since my aunt Debbie and unlce Wayne came down from pennsylvania.. uncle wayne brought my cousins potato launcher.. AMAZING me and matt went out back and shot it.. seriously.. it felt like I was in both worlds.. new age warfare and old age warfare.. Cause you needed a ram rod to push the whole potato down the barrell.. and it was like civil war sytle.. second you would put it on your shoulder and hit the switch at the top.. which felt like a missile launcher/bazouka.. it was so sick.. we each shot it twice.. since they are illegal and all.. and my uncle Joe is like going to be cheif of police or something.. but he ignored what was going on.. but we didnt want the neighbors calling the cops or something.. we shot it at a water jug to see if it would explode.. but we both came so fuckin close but didnt hit it.. you could seriously kill someone with that thing.. but it was fun.. im gonna check around.. see where we could bring that thing to see how far it would shoot.. maybe we will take out mailboxes with it or something.. im gonna build my own eventually.. my mom would fucking freak if I did it while she was around.. but im defintely making one for myself sometime.. LETS see.. umm.. I dunno what else to type.. that was like the highlight of my summer.. that and Imi.. ill prob email my cousin up.. ask him if he would let me come over and we shoot it.. I also drove my sisters old car in my grandparents back yard.. my dad said I was a good driver.. my mom flipped cause I messed around with her and went speeding by her.. but yeh.. thats all good.. im goin to bed.. night people.

And no one is online.. so this kinda sucks.. And my TV remote doesnt work, and I don't feel like getting up to change the channel every other minute.. Yesterday, lets see.. started ok.. then me and Imi got into a little riff.. and I wrote that post.. then we kissed and made up and all that stuff.. And then Yains fliped her lid on here.. Id ont blame her, though she might have wanted to word it differently.. I dunno.. Imi got mad at Yains for what she said.. so I had to calm her down and hopefully she is fine now.. Crrrazy day.. Well im not sure if I lost Yains.. hope not.. cause she means a lot to me.. but I suppose thats what happens.. you live and you learn; you crash and you burn.. And so now im awaiting Yains reply down there..


Hmm.. school in four days.. NO FUN.. summer went too quick methinks. Birthday is in 20 days.. not real fun there either(either..no either).. well.. im gonna go shower and sheeit like that.. talk to all you people laters.."

I dont realize anything until its all over.. im always messing up.. this time I thought I was right.. thought I was doing what they deserved.. but again.. I was wrong.. so im sorry I gave the person so much happiness.. and never felt much back.. and im sorry that I gt sick of it.. even if you truly werent real.. but again.. Yains made me realize everything.. and now I wish they were back.. even if they were fake.. I dunno.. that perosn deserves better than me anyway.. I screw up far too much.



All the time I spend constantly watching you
From the shadows of a darkened room
Are you mine does everyone belong to you
<b>Cause this heart, this heart is beggin' for you</b>
I just want, want for you to say
There could be, that there could be some way
And either you don't know or you just won't see it
I just want, I want you to know I'm the one, the one that loves you so
<b>And in the end it's always me who's losing.</b>

When I was a child, my castle was my home, now I walk down empty streets, memories and me alone, it's easier to burn a bridge that to cross it, to slip, give in, give up, move on, and try to forget... <b>more's been said in silence than could ever be spoken in words</b>, secret's shared, and promises kept, and feelings that will never be cured...


Im so bored. My sister had a B-Day party.. people came over and what not.. wasnt bad.. my brohers friend helped me fix my snare drum.. my cousin Matt was funny as usual, which is good. I dunno what else to say except I can not wait until I get my Link 80(R.I.P Nick Traina..) and Professor Plum(RIP P Plum) CDs in the mail.. I emailed one of the members of the broken up Professor Plum, and asked if he had any extra CDs he could sell me or burn and id pay him and what not. He replied saying he has both CDs and would burn them both for postage and 2 blank CDs.. AMAZING! Ive wanted the cds for SOOO long, ever since I was a youngin listening to them with my brother.. I totally loved them.. but then I dunno what the fuck happened to the CDs.. but they are gone essentially.. Now all I gotta do is find the first Pilfers album and I will be fucking set. I aslo wanna get the Skoidats CD.. that'd be cool.. I preordered the Encyclopedia Of Playing Card Flourishes Companion DVDs Volume 1.. cant wait for that to come.. ive gotten too much shit I think.. I dunno.. its 1:14.. I have about another hour or so until Imi gets on.. hopefully.. I have seriously almost completed my collection of old CDs that I LOVED.. so im happy.. really happy.. I need to get like one or two more.. and then I have all.. anyways.. umm.. my b-day is in like a month..I seriously hope I get enough money for a digital camcorder.. thats what I need.. fo' sho'... hmmm im chewing on a fork.. nothing has happened lately.. thats good.. cause when things happen its always bad.

Drinking for a living, that's just what I do,
When I'm not with you,
My heart goes to bed.
End of the bar, that's just where I'll be,
Don't try and come find me,
Cause I'm already dead. 
With one eye tied upon the open road,
I feel your presence and I can't let go.
It moves so slowly as it creeps into my mind,
Steals every breath I have and leaves my heart behind.

Wanna know what you're feeling, if your feeling alone,
I wanna hear if you still care
The last time I remember you was the last time I wasn't scared.

<b>When the night starts fading and and the morning arrives,
I wanna still feel you around,</b>
Will you creep into my head again and pick me up of the ground
Once more tell me what you're fighting for.

Gotta try, gotta try for tomorrow
When you can't see through today
There's nowhere left to stay.

<b>Sometimes I feel like I'm out here all alone
Just one in a million stuck with no place left to go.</b>

The fear steps up to me with every move that I make,
Following close behind my soul it wants to take."

The tension's building a reaction
This is a call to action

It's man's insanity and ignorance again
And now the time has come to stop what's going on
The hatred's build up, exploding like a bomb!

I liked it.. it was crazy.. today I talked a little to people.. sometimes I dont think I *truly* care for many people other than a few.. its hard realising the perfect person is in front of your eyes yet they are so far away.. its hard knowing you will never think of anyone else the way you do to them, but am unsure that you can become something more than what you are.. its hard.. hard wanting to live, when im not with you.. its hard imagining life without them.. the best and worst day of my life.. is when they wont further need me.. is it selfish to hope they will always need me as much as I need them?.. is it wrong to live for the future rather than today?..

WTF is this shit.. But that shit is gooooooooood.. Its the Dog Eat Dog CD.. (not the show.. the band was out way before the TV show).. Dog Eat Dog = Rap + Hardcore/Punk + Jazz(kinda).. Its sick.. Also the NOFX CD.. The only bad thing is half the CDs are kinda scratched up and some dont work. Im trying to get the Porkers CD to work.. but.. its looking skeptical.. Straight Faced CD is some SICK old school hardcore, but the first (and best) song fucks up. Hmmm. What other CDs did I find.. OMG the Oi Skampilation CD.. I NEED to get that to work or ill die.. Well no. .I wont..promised ya Imi ;).. but thats ok..

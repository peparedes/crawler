"event","life has been crazy these past couple of weeks!  working, partying, and moving in with heather.

a lot has been going on at work.  we got a new supervisor, tony.  he was our lead for our team and he took over the supervisor position when gil got moved to supervise the met team.  we have been struggling a lot these past 2 weeks since he has taken the position.  we are behind in almost everything.  i have been giving a lot more responsibilities...i'm in charge of 3 queues, i work the front desk, and i've been expediting a lot as well.  it can be overwhelming some days.  i'm usually stuck working 11+ hours a day.  tony is planning on hiring 2 more peeps.  we already got a new girl working with us, amanda.  i was training her saturday and today.  this week is even more sucky because the lady who works the front desk is on vacation the whole week so that means my second-hand man martin who helps me with the more important queues is stuck working the front desk most of this week, and then friday i'm up front all day.  i'm really thinking about changing my schedule to working monday through friday instead of working 4 ten hour days.  i don't know how many times i've said that.  i hate having to work saturdays now because i can't stay out late and party with my friends...

speaking of partying i've been doing that a lot these past couple of weeks.  i think it's mostly because of the fact that i was going to move in with heather and that once i did move in i wouldn't have the ""privileges"" anymore...that i would have to ask for permission to do things.  so i've been partying it up like a storm and doing my own thing.  gil had that house party which was so much fun!  martin and i got so fucked up that night.  i was dancing with everybody and i made out with a straight girl.  crazy!  i swear the moring-after french toast from the village inn had never tasted any better!  the next big outing that happened was the drag king show.  my friend aimee, aka ""poppy chulo"", is an amateur drag king.  i missed her debut so i felt like i had to go to the second showing.  i had so much fun and spent so much money on tipping the performers.  after the show we ended up staying at the club where me and my friends danced our asses off.  we always have so much fun when we go to the club.  we all dance freaky and shit.  i was dancing with my friend joe and he actually got a hard on!  i should mention that he is gay!  he was acting very strange that night...telling me not to leave him and to stay with him all night.  very weird.  then this past week i went out thursday, friday, and saturday night.  thursday martin and i went to applebees for our after work shot lol.  we met up with this guy shain from work and he kept on buying us rounds of vodka.  after applebees we headed over to the ranch.  it was my first time there, and i had a really good time.  cheap beer and pool.  it was karaoke night too, which was fun.  and then on friday me, my friend lena and her girlfriend naomi and their friend steven...we all went out to the pulse.  it was such a shitty night!  lena and steven ended up getting involved in some major drama so i spent half the night standing outside making sure no fists started flying.  lena got pissed at me because she felt like i didn't have her back...i was just trying to stay out of the whole thing because it's really none of my business to begin with.  i wished i could have just left but i had volunteered to drive so i had to stay.  so by the time we decided to leave i was really annoyed with the whole night.  when i was driving everybody home i got pulled over by a rookie cop who thought i was drunk.  i don't blame him for pulling me over because i was driving up the wrong side of the street....steven was giving me drunk directions to this apartment he was going to stay at and i ended up turning into a blocked off driveway into the complex.  i was too tired, lazy, and annoyed with everything at that point that i didn't get back to the right side of the road.  yep i just stayed on the left side of the rode and drove up to the next turn in to get into the complex.  my luck that the only car around at 2 am was a cop.  he pulled me over, treated me like shit...yelling at me that he could ""smell me from a mile away"".  in my head it was pretty ridiculous because i knew i was sober and nothing was going to happen other than a possible ticket.  he was so convinced i was wasted.  had to take the sobriety test and blow into breathalizer.  when i blew a 0 he let me go without even a ticket and told me to drive on the right side of the road next time.  to be honest i was scared as hell and it was an experience, and i won't ever drive after drinking because of it.  at least the cop was a rookie and didn't realize that my eyes were dilated.  anyway, i didn't get home that night until 3 or so.  i ended up just falling asleep in my clothes.  i was dragging the next day at work.  then that night aimee and anna had a party.  i swear i only had planned on staying for only 2 hours because i was tired as shit from getting 3 hours of sleep the previous night.  it ended up being a really crazy night too.  i will say though that some gay boys are the strangest people.  steven wanted me, this guy josh started sucking on my neck, and this gay couple said that if i was a boy they would want to take me home.  i think it must be my hair.  martin tried to explain it to me, and he said that it's because i look like a boy.  i don't understand lol!  at least the lesbians that were there wanted me too lol!  aimee told me that she had requests from some of the girls to find out who i was and to let me know that i was ""fucking hot"".  anna told me that i could use the upstairs room that was empty, and in the end i did.  it was a crazy, crazy night.  i really need to stop hanging out with these people, even though they are fun as hell.  they really are a bad influence on me.  

that's about it for now.  i'm gonna head back home and let heather's dog out to pee.  maybe tonight she will want to have sex lol.  

peace out."

anyway...long day today.  i'm surprised i actually made it through.  i didn't sleep very well last night because everytime i woke up to roll over i felt so nauseous.  it started yesterday late afternoon when i left heather's to go to work for a few hours.  i almost lost my lunch at work i few times, but i was able to hold it down.  i stayed at work until 9:45 or so knocking out the referrals in my queue.  got home in one piece...because when i'm sick all i want to do is sleep, and i was afraid of falling asleep in the car.  i got home and just crashed.  this morning i woke up and i thought i was feeling better until i was about to leave to go to work.  i was so sick!!  after this morning i'm never going to purchase the chicken enchiladas with red at duran's ever again!!  after all of that i was still able to get my ass to work and work 10 hours.      

i worked ever single one of my days off this week.  5 hours on sunday, 5 hours monday, and 4 hours on tuesday.  today i worked 10 and tomorrow i will work 10.  it's worth it because i have friday and saturday off (pto of 20 hours!!!) so i should be getting some $$$ for this week boy!!

yesterday i had an eye appointment.  picked out some cute frames for my new glasses and picked up new contacts.  apparently my new eye insurance doesn't cover contacts because i had to cough up 73 bucks for 2 boxes.  heather said that she would pay for my glasses because, well, it was her dog that destroyed my old pair.  i can't wait until my glasses are ready.  i'm tired of having to wear my contacts all the effing time.

my check is a little weak this payday...mostly because i didn't have my badge with me this past saturday so i didn't get the hours in for that day.  those hours will show up on my next pay check.  i still have enough to give a chunk to my credit card company though, which is all that i care about right now lol.  

look at what heather and i are gonna buy friday morning before we head out to the gila.  we saw it at the sportsman's warehouse:

camping is going to rock.  i'm so excited.  :D

i need to go to my bank and complain because i ordered checks about 3 weeks ago and they haven't arrived.  i used the last one when i went to finalize things with gilbert (my car insurance agent) monday.  i'll be damned if i have to pay for another stupid order!

good news!  gil moved his house warming party to next saturday!!!!

alright i'm done.  peace out."

"event","i was late to work today.  i woke up suddenly this morning and checked my watch.  i was horrified to see that it was 7:05.  i don't think i ever got dressed so fast in my entire life.  i realized halfway to work, doing 90 on the freeway, that i left all my crap at heather's house...my cell phone, my work badge, my license.  i was only rushing because i was 4 hours late on friday as well...

i am glad that i have such an awesome supervisor.  i emailed him this morning that i was late again, he said not to worry and that ""sh_t happens"" lol.  he said that he has my back and he won't let anything happen in terms of me losing my job.  that's awesome!  he said that he loves my work ethic and my personality, and told me not to worry.  i love gil!  it's a shame that i can't make his house warming party this coming saturday.  i would love to go!  i told him he should have let me know what was going down before i made plans to go camping.  

thursday night heather and i headed over to amc.  she was able to get the next day off because of an appointment, so we went out.  she got so drunk lol.  i know she's drunk when she gets on top of the boxes and dances her ass off lol.  we ended up meeting heather's under-aged friend ashley there, and heather was able to get her into the club.  my honey really knows the tricks of the trade.  i really think we are corrupting ashely lol!  it was her first time in a gay club, and it was a bit of a shock because there are all types of gay folk that hang out there.  after the club we went to denny's where every other gay drunk person and their friends ended up going as well.  it was really strange.  anyway, afterwards i dropped ashley off back at the club so she could get her car and head home.  then heather and i headed home.  we didn't get to bed until about 5 am.  that's really the reason i didn't go to work at 7.  i slept in until 10.  good times...

i think my clothes are dry now.  i need to put them away and head back over to heather's house.  i'm so sleepy!  

i need to work tomorrow for 5 hours and then we are going to start getting the camping stuff ready.  later on tomorrow heather and i will meet up with a couple of my friends from work at laffs for the 8 pm show.  and then anna and aime are having an l word party tomorrow night.  such a full day!

i'm so going to go running tomorrow morning and going to the gym in the afternoon.  i've been feeling so gross lately.  it must be because of my period."

"event","it's official.  i finally have a car of my own!  yesterday i bought a 2001 nissan x-terra!  it's my baby!!!! it's white and all pretty looking!  it's a standard!  payments are only $287/month, which isn't bad at all, and it's including warranty.  insurance is a little high, but that will go down within 6 months.  it's so awesome!  it's so me!!  everyone at work was very impressed with it hehehe!  heather and i are gonna try it out next weekend when we go camping down at the gila.  we are both very excited! :D

i have a couple of things i still need to take care of.  i need to make an appt with my mechanic to have him check out a couple of things before the 60 day initial warranty is up.  i need to get together with my insurance agent to finalize things as well.  

i feel so independent!  it's fucking awesome!  i didn't need a co-signer or anything.  i feel so great...

"event","i had a horrible day at work today!  i had patients yelling at me, pharmacists yelling at me.  i had to deal with stupid insurance companies even though i've never been trained in eligibility.  and to top it all of i got a verbal warning for....taking short lunches!  i wasn't even aware that i was taking short lunches.  apparently i have been clocking in 3 and 4 minutes earlier than i'm allowed to.  i wasn't even aware of it, and i'm so not doing it on purpose.  lately i've been so focused on all the work i have to do that i don't even pay attention to the times when i clock in and clock out.  fucking shit man!  

you know what i think?  i think that because i made so much more money during the last pay period they are now checking my time sheets and analyzing every little clock in and clock out.  i bet you that is what is happening!  i know for a fact that they are hating that techs are making a lot of money due to ot and whatnot.  i can totally see them cracking down on things, and the little slips that people are making are being shoved into their faces.  so fucked up!  

damn.  i can't believe that today i completely hated my place of work.  after i was verbally warned i was fuming man!  i was so ready to quit right then and there.  here is what i have to say about the whole thing:  i think that management has to take the broom stick out of the ass and get a grip.  they are only making shit worse and adding to everyone's stress level.  i think that tempe should have to deal with their own exceptions referrals instead of giving them all to my department.  it's like all they freakin do in arizona is sit on their ass because they give us (abq) all their issues!  and finally i think that gaye lynn can just go to hell...fucking grumpy old witch. 

i'm fed up with it.  i'm thinking about applying to cardinal health where i can be doing basically the same shit and be paid more.  and it's just across the street!  how conveeeenient.....  

ugh, anyway.  today one of my childhood friend's, amanda, came in when i was working the front desk this morning.  she's all married now and her hubby is on active duty with the military.  she actually use to work at express scripts, in the back end to be exact.  kinda cool.  

that's about it.  i'm gonna go to sleep and hope that tomorrow will be a better day.  that is actually something i have doubts about already because it's friday and fridays always suck a big one at work."

"event","i took a nice long 3 day weekend.  saturday night i went out to a pizza party for lena's daughter and her cousin.  anna and amy were there along with lena's girlfriend naomi.  even joe and his boyfriend charles were there.  joe has been martin's fuck buddy for about 2 weeks now.  it's so crazy!!  hehehe...so i decided to eat free pizza and salad instead of going over to my supervisor's ufc party since it was closer to my house.  i didn't want to drive all the way across town.  it will be better once he moves to this side of town.  anyway, after the pizza party we all went to the club.  i didn't tell heather that i was gonna go out to the club because she would just annoy me about how she wouldn't be around.  she still doesn't know i went out.  i had so much fun dude!  heather would be proud of me...i didn't hook up with anyone, or dance with anyone, or really even look at anyone lol.  i just drank and danced with my own groovy self haha.  i got so drunk though.  i drank so much that when i got home later i was so sick!  i was vomiting on the hour, every hour.  i told heather that it was food poisoning from the ghetto pizza i had eaten.  it was horrible.  i had to call out of work sunday.  there was no way i could work my voluntary 5 hours.  horrible.  and i so owe my honey a hotel weekend.  she had to cancel our 2 month anniversary hotel getaway cos i was too sick.  i still feel really bad about it...i can't bring myself to tell her the real reason i was sick.  

i still haven't fully recovered from being sick.  i can only eat one meal a day, and after i eat i get a little nauseous.  i can't help it!  even the thought of alcohol makes me a little queazy too.  so i don't think i will be drinking friday at the comedy club.  i won free tickets to the 8 pm show (again), and everyone from work is coming.  martin, lena and her girlfriend and their 5 gay friends, kimberly, caroline, maybe even loriann.  today i had to ask caroline if she doesn't mind if she hangs out with a bunch of gay people friday night.  she will most likely be the only straight person there lol. 

i so landed a hefty check for this coming payday.  $921.86!!!!!!!  i worked a total of 104.25 hours.  26.75 hours of ot and 4 hours of double time really kicked in this time.  i will be able to pay most of my credit card bill and get an mp3 player.  excellent!!  :D

"event","i only worked 3 hours today.  i left early because i just could not function with this stupid headcold that i acquired over the last 48 hours.  i had felt it coming on wednesday.  stupid me went out to laffs to watch some stand up comedy that night with a couple of friends instead of going home and getting some rest.  oh well.  anyway, i can only hope that the higher ups at work will realize that i already completed my 6 hours of mandatory ot for this week won't dock me an entire point for leaving early today.  i already talked to my supervisor about saturday's mandatory ot, and he said that it would be ok that i did it on sunday.  so i have to work 10 hours saturday and at least 8 hours on sunday.  then i have to make up today's hours on monday and tuesday.  it sucks that i won't even get a day off.  i really can't complain though, because they are offering double time for any extra hours put in once we've hit 50 for the week...

i'm actually feeling a whole lot better than earlier.  after i left work i hit the bank to deposit my check then i headed over to heather's where i slept for a couple of hours.  i left her place and went to walgreens where i picked up this airborne stuff that my friend kimberly suggested i take.  it's kinda like alka-seltzer...these tablets that you put in water and they dissolve.  so i put a tab in a bottle of water about an hour and a half ago, and i feel amazingly better already.  after walgreens i went across the street to best buy where i picked up britney spears' greatest hits.  hehe heather it so gonna kill me! lol

speaking of which, my honey has really surprised me lately, both good and bad.  she surprised me last sunday with tickets to go see lifehouse.  she also bought me their new cd which allowed me to meet the band as well.  that was great.  on the downside, last night she finally whipped out the ""i love you"".  really surprised me, and of course i said it back.  i need to have a little talk with her because i know i'm not on the same level with her.  not quite. it takes me more than a month to figure out if i love somebody, and i don't want to just say that i do if i don't mean it, you know?  i really like her, but i'm not in love.  not yet.  especially since lately i've had very serious doubts about us.           

tommorow night (if i feel better that is) i'm hitting the clubs with kimberly and martin.  gonna go to exhale first and then head to the pulse.  i think we might cab it.  i so cannot wait!  martin and kim are so fucking fun to hang out with.  i still have to tell heather though.  she's been so up in my grill lately that i really don't want to let her know what i'm doing tomorrow night.  she's been checking my texts on my phone, and wanting to know about every single phone conversation that i have.  if i was doing something to hurt her i would understand, but i'm not doing a damn thing!  i really don't know what her problem is.  she gets really annoyed with me when i don't let her read my texts.  i mean she dislikes all my friends anyway, so i feel that she really doesn't need to know what we talk about or what we do unless i deem it necessary that she knows.

that's about it for now i suppose.  i need to go throw my clothes in the dryer and head back over to heather's.  i left my damn cell phone there."

"event","my new year's eve went down like a ton of bricks.  the plan was to hit tamon's (heather's friend) party and then possibly head over to my friend lena and her girlfriend's little get together.  heather called me early in the afternoon to let me know she was feeling really sick and that she was having an allergic reaction to something.  yeah, fucking great right?  yeah pretty typical.  anyway, i ended up purchasing a ridiculous amount of alcohol for the parties and most of it is still either in the fridge or the freezer at heather's house.  we brought the beer over to tamon's party.  we left within 10 seconds of arriving, along with my beer.  i wasn't going to let all those gangster stoners have any of my alcohol.  after having left tamon's lit up party, i called lena and asked where she lived.  turned out she lives practically in timbuktu, and i didn't want to drive all the way across town for a lesbian ""get together"".  i wanted to fucking party man.  we ended up going to the pulse where i spent $30 for both of us to get in.  by that time heather was feeling really shitty, and i just wanted to get really fucked up.  i bought us both drinks and i ended up drinking them both.  i knew heather was really not feeling well when she couldn't finish a damn beer.  i was a tad bit annoyed the whole time we were there because all heather felt like doing was sitting down or standing in one place.  her muscles were achy and shit, so she was not up to getting all freaky on the dance floor with me.  i had spent all this money and all we basically did was sit around.  i tried my best to have a good time, and that pretty much meant just getting fucked up.  when i was buying my first ""sex on the beach"" i was hit on hard by this really cute girl.  all i can remember is that i really wanted to hookup with her.  but alas, i didn't, since my girlfriend was sitting on one of the couches waiting for me to return.  as a matter of fact i did a lot of ""checking out the girl's"" kind of thing.  i was quite unhappy being with my girlfriend last night.  we ended up leaving before midnight and spent new year's in a walmart, buying bagel bites for my drunk ass.

today i drove heather to the urgent care center, paid for her copay, bought breakfast for us both, drove her to the grocery store, paid for her juice, 7up, soup (ya know, the basic ""i'm sick with the flu"" groceries), spent my entire day with her, calling on her every beckoning need, and all she did was whine and moan that she wasn't feeling well and point out to me that i didn't even care.  i can't believe i missed out on bowling with my friends from work for all that.    

plus we haven't had sex yet and her views on mentally disabled individuals disturbs me. 

so yeah, i'm not so sure anymore."

holy shit! my brother has to have a serious attitude adjustment.  the dogs are barking like maniacs and they woke him up.  he just went outside and started yelling at them.  i think his metal music gets to his head sometimes :\
<hr>
so i met this girl heather.  she hit me up on that yahoo personals site and we've been chatting for a few days now.  she is 25 and very cool.  she really isn't the person i had pictured her being at all.  we met up and had a very early dinner yesterday at gardunos.  that place has some seriously good food.  mmmmm.  then i had to jet home to give my bro the car.  he had a concert to go to at 7.  i wish he would have let me known sooner!!! :p  heather picked me up a little later and we went to sidelines to shoot pool and watch football.  we had 2 pitchers of beer and shared fried mushrooms and mozzy sticks.  we left after these ghetto guys came in and took a seat right near us.  it was a little uncomfortable.  then we headed over to exhale around 11.  i don't understand how that place works.  i go there alone and no one hits on me, but i go there with someone and everyone hits on me!  lesbians are weird!!!!  we met up with heather's friend beverly.  she was so drunk and so funny haha!  we played a few games of pool and air hockey and danced a little and had more to drink.  good times.  i won't see heather again until the middle of this week.  she works the next 3 nights.  her police car rocks!  i told her i want to ride in it one of these days lol.  the three of us (bev, myself, heather) are going to the pulse next weekend.  i love the pulse!  :D

i registered for classes the other day.  planning on taking quantitative analysis with a lab and cell biology with the discussion group.  i would have class tuesdays and thursdays.  on tuesdays i would be in school all day.  first lecture is at 9:30 and i would end it with the 4 hour lab and the discussion group, getting out of school at 8:15 at night.  thursdays i would just have the 2 lecture classes in the morning.  i think my problem is that i don't know what my work schedule is going to be.  i know that i will have to work 10 hour days on monday, wednesday, friday, and saturday.  i really don't want to work a 10 hour day on saturday, but i don't know if i would be allowed to put hours in on thursday.  it's just too complicated!  i most likely will end up taking the quant with the lab and save the bio for the summer, which i really don't want to do.  it's all too complicated.  geeez i don't know how i'm going to do school and work full time!

alright well i need to shower.  i smell like cigarette smoke.  then i have laundry to do."

"event","just got out of my last organic chemistry lab ever!!!!  the crossed aldol condensation that we did only took an hour to finish, so we got out super early!  next week is check out and then we are fin for good!  

i spent a good part of the hour conversing with my lab mates about pharmacy school.  hawaii (i call this guy hawaii because that is where he is from, and i can never remember his first name haha!) said that he just finished applying to unm's pharmacy school last week via pharmcas.  i told him that i was going to apply, but recently changed my mind.  he told me that he is really anxious about hearing from them.  it should take up to 5 weeks for the university to contact him for an interview.  he's nervous because he doesn't think that his grades in all of the prereqs were really all that good.  he has about a 3.0 gpa in his prereqs, near the lower end of the competitive gpa scale.  this girl who i partnered up with today said that she was thinking about applying to pharmacy school, but that she was really afraid too because of the competition.  she will be graduating this spring with a double major.  she said her prereq gpa was about 3.0, near the lower end of the gpa's considered ""competitive"".  plus she said she doesn't have any pharmacy related experience.  hawaii has been working at the woman's hospital for a couple of months now as a tech, and he also has been working at smiths for almost a year as a tech.  the pharmacy school really looks applicants who have had experience and whatnot in the pharmacy field.  see now, i have about a 3.3 competitive gpa, and i have the experience now that i'm working at express scripts.  the only real thing that is holding me back are the three letters of rec that i need to send in when i apply.  i really have no idea who to ask or how to ask (plus i can't really afford to apply right now, damn application fees!).  i'll have to give it some thought.  i'm still really considering getting my bs first, and then applying.  i think i would have more of an edge to get in with a degree, along with the experience and the fairly competitive gpa.  hawaii said that i should just apply.  i told him i would have to think about it.

ok i guess i better get going.  i can't apply to tvi just yet because i realized today that i'm classified as a non-resident for some reason, so the cost of my credit hours would go up 65498%.  i need to sort out that before i do anything.  i also need to get paid first since i would have to pay the disenrollment balance by the following business day.  fuckers!  i already planned out a different schedule, taking 2 classes and 2 labs here at unm instead of taking classes at tvi and unm.  it would cost me over $1000, and i would still be taking classes tuesdays and thursdays.  but the only day i wouldn't be able to go to work was tuesday.  that would leave thursday open to get in some overtime hours at work.  

i'm not going to hold my breath or anything.  my mind changes too quickly for anything to be put into stone.  

work tomorrow, 7 to 3:30.  i might work until 5:30 just for the extra money.  hopefully there will be work for me to do."

i've been going through computer withdrawls this past week lol.  our puter at home is officially out of commission for good unless the madre can find someone to put in a new hard drive for cheap.  can't afford a replacement at the moment.  hopefully after i get paid i will be able to afford my very own computer.  i should be getting a hefty first check with the overtime i have been working and the holiday pay that will be included.  

ugh speaking of pay day, it can't come soon enough man!  i've been forced to charge practically <i>everything</i>!  my credit card bill is going to be killer.  thank bob my pay is going to <b>increase</b> to $10/hr as soon as the next pay period hits.  my supervisor decided to allow me to train as an exceptions technician instead of continuing to work as a clerk.  so that is what i have been doing this past week at work.  training also continues this week as well.  it's great!  i love my job.  i have two nicknames that people have been calling me...""colorado"" and ""brilliant resident genius"" lol!  ""colorado"" is what rocky calls me, because i am really down to earth.  my supervisor, tara, has been calling me the ""brilliant resident genius"" because i was able to fix a minor computer problem tuesday.  last tuesday when the actual tech training started, mostly everybody was unable to view the vaxes entirely because the screen resolutions were too big for the screens.  the class was haulted for about an hour because darlene's (the woman who is training us) screen was ""too small"" for the images.  the computer i was using didn't have a viewing problem, but i did know to fix everybody else's viewing problems.  a simple display change was the answer.  i was able to fix it all before tara could bring in a girl to fix the resolution problem.  since then i've been known as the ""brilliant resident genius"".  heh!  

my thanksgiving was alright.  spent most of the day in the kitchen and playing monopoly with al.  since i had so much to eat these past few days, i started a diet today lol.  i did awesome today!  managed to not cheat at all with all the extra pumpkin pie/birthday cake/ice cream lying around!  so proud of myself!

i get to register for classes at tvi tomorrow.  yay!  i already have it planned out.  gonna take quant plus the lab at unm, and then take sociology, religion, and a physics lab at tvi.  only 11 credits total.  only going to be in class on tuesdays and thursdays from 7:30 in the morning to 8:45 at night.  i would work 10 hour shifts monday, wednesdays, fridays, and saturdays.  gosh that seems like a lot, doesn't it?  i'm never going to have a life!

i smashed my effing finger today.  it's all bruised underneath the nail! :(  couldn't play guitar because of it.  i actually had to do my lab homework for tomorrow lol.  i'm stoked that tomorrow is the last day of lab and that next week is checkout.  woot! 

i keep having this crazy dream.  i'm on this date with this girl, and we end up making out in the bathroom.  so hot!!  it's driving me insane!

i have realized though, that i haven't been into my school work these past few days because of this new job.  i have a chem test tomorrow and i haven't really been in the mood to prepare for it.  i kept telling myself everyday at work that i would get home and study a little for my test.  all i did was get home and wind down lol.  watch tv and just chill.  i don't know how i'm going to be able to go to school and work full time at the same time.  is that even possible?!  how does one do it??  

now i'm forced to cram for this dumb test tonight.  blah!  hopefully it will be ok.  if not, well, it will be the test that gets dropped hehe!

let me think what else has been going on?  hmmm.  oh my dogs have been more annoying than ever.  bud got over the wall into the neighbor's backyard this morning.  both dogs have to be chained up when they are put outside, which is almost all the time because they get into more trouble in the house.  one of the little bastards got to my complimentary express scripts coffee mug and they both chewed the thing up.  i didn't even have it for a full 24 hours.  depressing.  this morning they got to another coffee mug that i swear i pushed back on the counter so that they wouldn't get to it.  had to sweep up the broken pieces.  the madre emailed this adoption agency a few days ago.  hopefully we will hear from them soon because the mutts have got to go!

because of them i've been missing my little handsome man goliath a lot lately! :\  he was an awesome dog man!

"event","damnit!  why can't i just figure out what i want to do with my life??  reading this little story made me rethink not attending pharmacy school next year:

<i>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Unlike most college students nearing 
graduation, Clarissa Hall isn't worried about finding a job - she's 
already considering several offers, including some with possible 
starting salaries of at least $80,000. Hall is benefiting from a 
nationwide shortage of pharmacists, which has prompted fierce 
competition between employers for new pharmacy graduates.

""Pretty much everyone in my class has people calling them left and 
right about jobs,"" said Hall, a University of Missouri-Kansas City 
student from Poplar Bluff. ""I've had several people calling me and I 
don't even graduate until May.""

The shortage of pharmacists, though, is not good for others in the 
medical field, or their patients, say those who have been watching 
the shortage worsen over the last decade.

It was fueled by several factors, especially changes in insurance 
policies and federal regulations of pharmaceuticals, which made drugs 
available to more people.

Add to that an aging population and more drugs being manufactured and 
advertised to the public, and the number of prescriptions has 
increased from 2 billion to 3.2 billion in the last decade. That 
problem is expected to worsen after the new Medicare prescription 
drug program begins Jan. 1, pharmacy officials said.

Independent and chain pharmacies, hospitals and nursing homes are 
scrambling to find people to fill orders.

The National Association of Chain Drug Stores reported about 5,950 
full- and part-time openings in July in its 37,000 member stores. The 
American Hospital Association reported a 7.4 percent vacancy rate for 
pharmacists as of December, 2004, with 38 percent of its members 
saying it was harder to recruit pharmacists last year than in 2003.

The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents 
independent pharmacies, does not keep track of job openings.

A consortium of pharmacy groups called the Pharmacy Manpower Project 
issued a report in 2002 predicting 157,000 unfilled pharmacy openings 
by 2020.

The need to fill all those new prescriptions has been partially 
addressed by an increase in technology and the use of pharmacy 
technicians, said Dr. David Knapp, dean of the School of Pharmacy at 
the University of Maryland.

But that hasn't addressed increasing pressure on pharmacists to 
become more involved in helping patients manage their drugs, 
especially elderly patients who may take several medicines, said 
Knapp, who coordinated the conference that released the Manpower 
report.

""Every hour of every day, dozens if not hundreds of prescriptions are 
coming across the counter,"" he said. ""They are trying to do that 
while at the same time counseling patients, calling physicians, 
helping diabetic patients manage eight or 10 medicines, teaching 
parents how to help their child use his new asthma inhaler. It's a 
real stressed out situation for pharmacists.""

Around the country, universities are opening new pharmacy schools or 
expanding existing programs, but it likely will take years for supply 
to meet demand. Some schools have reported 10 applicants for every 
pharmacy opening, although that figure includes people applying to 
more than one school, Maine said.

""It is a great job market for those who get in,"" Maine said. ""But we 
also have a lot of disappointed people who are being turned away.""

Many universities have opened satellite programs, and about 20 new 
pharmacy schools have opened in the last five years, Knapp said. That 
should increase the number of graduating pharmacists to more than 
10,000 in 2007, compared to about 8,000 graduates in 2003-04, Maine 
said.

""There is such an astonishing interest,"" said Lucinda L. Maine, 
executive vice president of the American Association of Colleges of 
Pharmacy in Alexandria, Va. ""It's the highest level I've seen in my 
30 years in pharmacy admissions.""

But even new schools and expansions will not help in the short-term, 
which raises concerns about whether patients will get the information 
they need about their medications, said Robert Piepho, dean of the 
Missouri-Kansas City pharmacy school.

""If patients don't have access (to pharmacists), they run the risk of 
adverse effects from drug interactions."""

oh you know what i should do?  i think tomorrow i will go down to the park and shoot my basketball around.  i've been meaning to do that for a while now.

the dogs are still fighting really badly.  earlier tonight the madre saw them go at it.  lou was able to sneak in and get bud from behind while i was in the other room, so i couldn't stop him.  she said once we were able to get a hold of them that if the neutering doesn't work then we will have to give one of them away for sure.  she already knows someone who will want one if that was to happen.  we'll see.

darn!  i wish i hadn't left my glasses at work.  my contacts are killing me!  

speaking of which, i need to order more since i'm down to my last 2 week pair.

i'm waiting for al to get back home with the package of kettle corn i told her to buy hahaha!  i've been craving something sweet and salty.  mmmmm kettle corn!

rawr!!  i cannot find guitar tabs for any susan mckeown songs anywhere!! :(

i'm really in the mood for coffee right now.  if i had a car i would head over to starbucks.  i was so needing it this morning.  i whipped out carla's old coffee/espresso machine that she gave me but there was no where to put it.  i didn't realize until this morning  that the counter tops in the kitchen were so cluttered with kitchenware that is never, ever used lol.  so i decided to use the coffee maker that was already plugged in.  then i realized that there was no coffee in the house except a small thing of this instant ""just add hot water"" coffee.  man that stuff is crap!  dumped that mug down the drain and tried some of this suisse mocha international coffee powder.  that was crap too!  i toiled in the kitchen for a good hour this morning and didn't produce a single cup of java.  so then i went for the remaining halloween candy instead.  the end."

"event","fuck my fucking dogs man!  they have been fighting viciously for the past 4 hours.  we have to keep them apart or they go after each other's throats.  we think that their behavior has something to do with them not being neutered.  the madre just left to go get 2 crates.  fucking mutts have been nothing but trouble since they got here.  i say drop them off at the pound and forget em!  fucking dogs.  nothing but a waste of time and money.

when i went to get my drug test done i met two other girls who were also there for a pre-employment drug test for express scripts.  both of them got data entry technician positions.  coolness.  they both have been techs for a couple of years now.  

i got a lovely ""thanks for your interest but we cannot offer you a position"" card from target in the mail.  heh how amusing.  i hope each person consisting of the human resources team burn in their own personal fiery hells :)

"event","i dropped my a&p lab last night.  i'm not doing as well as i liked.  heh i should just be honest and say that it was a class i just didn't give a shit about.  i can take it at tvi next semester so no biggie. 

so i ended up having 2 interviews yesterday.  i had the first one at 9:15 in the morning over at keva juice.  the second interview was kind of last minute.  i got a call on the ride home from school wednesday from express scripts and the lady, carrie, wanted to set up a last minute interview.  express scripts was this mail-order pharmacy that i applied to a few weeks ago.  anyway i had that interview at 1, which was nice because it gave me time to head over to the mall and pick up a pair of khaki pants.  which, by the way, are a little too big.  

long story short, i was offered a job as an acceptance clerk at express scripts.  carrie and some woman (hiring manager perhaps?) who was in charge of the pharmacy were both blown away by the fact that i had passed the tech. certification test just by studying from a book.  they were really cool about allowing me to have a chance to get my foot in the door and on my way to being an actual pharmacy tech.  i do believe i was told that the an acceptance clerk works kind of hand in hand with a tech, so i would be able to gain some experience and move up into a tech. position within a few months.  i was given a start date (the 15th) and the pay is ok ($8.50/hr).  exciting, but i'm not going to hold my breath.  i don't know i just feel that even though i've been given this opportunity that it's just going to end up like the whole walgreens fiasco.  something is just not going to go right and i'm going to end up losing this job.  i just feel it.  they won't be able to work out the hours or they won't be able to contact the fucking target reference.  something!  i just feel it.  so i won't really believe it until i walk in that first day and i'm given a set work schedule. 

i'm feeling pretty pessimistic right now, yet very awake.  and hungry!  i'm really hungry.  need to get a big salad soon.  

my night at work last night was crazy.  yesterday joe was given an antibiotic for his sinus infection.  the damn pill made him sick the whole night long.  talk about a way to find out that you are allergic to amoxilcillin.  i put him to bed early but he woke up around 9 with ""stomach pain"".  i didn't know if it was like shooting pain or nausea.  he wouldn't tell me, but i suspected nausea.  it was.  he wanted to take a shower thinking that it would help him feel a little better.  that worked until he got out of the shower and threw up.  after sitting near the bathroom for a few minutes i gave him some pepto hoping it would help and carried him back to bed.  it was a good thing that i put a plastic bag in one of the small trashcans in the room because he threw up again.  luckily i was around and was able to put the trashcan up to him so he wouldn't get puke everywhere.  so much for the pepto.  i didn't dare give him anymore of that or any of his regular meds.  i made him a little bed in the room where i sleep, carried him in and put him down.  poor guy crashed right out.  i put the trashcan with a new plastic bag in it at the bottom of his ""bed"" and then i got into bed.  i had just fallen asleep when i heard him starting to throw up again.  i tried to get him to throw up in the trashcan but it came up too fast.  puke was everywhere.  i slopped up most of it (while trying not to throw up myself) and put the blankets in the wash.  made him another ""bed"" and he fell asleep again.  he was fine the rest of the night thankfully.  i don't know if he went to school today.  linda said she would give me a call to let me know if she is going to head to work tonight.  i hope i can head over there because she needs to pay me.

i have to pee really bad but i'm holding it because i need to pee in a cup for this pre-emplyment drug test.  i have to hold it for another 2 hours.  is it possible for one's bladder to explode? 

gonna eat."

"event","not a very eventful week.  just been on a hunt for a job.  i'm just about to cross that ""i would never, ever work there"" line.  if i blow this job interview i have on thursday i just might have to.  hopefully i can find a job in the smoothie business, probably making less money than i do now.    

i worked the last two nights.  halloween was interesting.  carla, myself and the kids went to their church's festival.  we had to get all the excitement done within an hour because we got there really, really late lol.  i got 2 free pumpkins, my hair dyed green, and i had enough candy to last me the entire month.  i know i'm depressed when all i want to eat is chocolate.

linda is really pissing me off...keeps bugging me about not having found a job yet.  it's not for a lack of trying that's for sure.  she should just get off my back.  she'll see how it is when i'm no longer there and all hell breaks loose.

i'm going to see an advisor tomorrow to finalize my major change.  how ironic it is, though, when i won't even be attending unm next semester."

"event","today i finally decided to change my college career path.  for the past 3 years my work in college focused on getting into pharmacy school.  but as of late i have felt that pharmacy school was really the wrong path for me, at least right now.  so i have decided to obtain a bs in biochemistry.  i love science and the affects it has on our lives, so i feel that biochemistry is the major for me.   perhaps pharmacy school will interest me more after i get my degree in biochemistry.  only time will tell.  all i know right now is that a labratory career doing research sounds much more appealing and standing around in a pharmacy.  

i'm going to make my decision official tomorrow after class and visit the college of arts and sciences.

need to call donna at this target i applied at yesterday.  she'll be in after 6.  i'm pretty sure i got a stupid cashier job.  i effing hated working at target 3 years ago at this time of year.  people were rude and they treated me like shit.  but i have to pay the bills and this is really the only job right now that is available since no one has called me from any other place.  gotta do it.

had class today, went well.  i have a test next monday that i have already started to prepare for.  i also have a lab practical this coming friday in a&p.  need to start studying for that.

last thursday i met heather at the mall.  we flirted all kinds.  i don't know what she was so afraid about.  she is frustrating though lol.  she texts me all kinds, yet when i call and leave a message she doesn't get back to me.  whatever.  i'm leaving the dating choices up to her since i really don't want to waste my time anymore. 

while at the mall i bought a pair of jeans.  i'm a size 10 now! :D  had to pay for the jeans in cash though since i somehow managed to have insufficient funds available in my checking account.  i have been really good in maintaining records of my expenses.  i checked my account online and i noticed a very strange atm withdrawl that included a fee.  it was a withdrawl made from out of this country!  so today i had to head to the bank and close my current checking account, open a new one, and file a fraud claim.  i should be reimbursed for the money that was taken out of my account by the end of this week.  i need to order new checks and all that as well.  feck paypal for allowing someone to get to my banking information.  

i'm awaiting a reply to an email i sent to allfaiths.org.  i inquired about a full time position via email since heather has been absolutely no help there.  at school today i sent my resume to express scripts.  they were actually looking for a technician so hopefully i will hear something from them soon.  this is my last week as a nanny and i need to find something soon."

"event","right now i'm sitting in the puter lab in the library.  i have a bit of a break until the bro gets out of class.  i really have nothing else to do.  i had planned on making note cards for my next chem test, but i left all the note cards at home.  and rather me sit in the sub trying to keep myself awake due to lack of sleep, i'm keeping myself busy now.

sometime today i need to get a hold of heather.  we kinda sorta have plans for tomorrow, but not really lol.  i know she works today.  i think she gets out at 4.  i have to let her know that my work schedule changed from working tonight to tomorrow, and that i can't do anything after 5 tomorrow.  i really hope she doesn't freak herself out again like she did sunday night.  i can't understand why people put so much pressure on the first ""date"" or ""meeting"" or whatever you want to call it.  

monday i was given my 2 weeks notice.  linda told me that she wanted joe to work more with carla, so therefore she would no longer need me to work for her.  ironic, since about a month ago she was flipping out about me possibly finding a better job and leaving.  the true thing about it though is that she cannot afford to pay me.  apparently financially she has run herself into the ground.  monday night when i was over at work carla and i talked about it.  she is really dreading the fact that i'm not going to be around anymore.  linda just sprung this whole idea on carla from out of the blue, and carla really didn't know what to say.  first of all, both carla and joe are two very headstrong people, and they are both constantly butting heads.  the only thing that is going to come from me not being around is the setback joe is probably going to have to face.  i'm a very neutral person in his life, and once i'm gone he is going to have to face major change.  and from my experience, this kid absolutely doesn't deal with change very well, especially when it's so sudden like this.  it's not going to be good for them.  

i, on the other hand, now have the perfect chance to get a better paying, documented job.  i really have no choice since i have bills that need to be paid.  i have apped at a few more places.  heather even told me that i could work where she works.  the pay is alright, and i would only work 4 days, 10 hours a day.  i have to fax in my resume soon if i were to do that.  right now my focus will be on saving up enough money to go to school out of state."

talked to brandi today for what seemed like forever.  we were trying to figure out what went wrong and why.  it sucks that the happiness she felt wasn't mutual, and that i ended up hurting her like i did.  this whole break up thing isn't easy for me and i wish things hadn't ended the way they have.

tomorrow carla is going to get a tattoo, and i am gonna go with.  i'm so dying to get another one.  i have the what and the where all figured out.  i really can't afford it though.  i need to start prioritizing.  i need to register for the pcat soon, and then i have purchase study materials, etc.  i wish i had enough money to afford the things i wanted.

so i didn't get that job at walgreens.  two weeks ago i gave lionel, the pharmacy manager at the walgreens who offered me a job, the number to the target reference.  he told me that he would keep me up to date with his decision.  it was a ""down to the wire decision""...he told me that day that they were planning on bringing in an experienced tech from santa fe.  i was like fucking great!  so of course he never called me back.  i thought that maybe i would give him a call myself, but in the end i figured i didn't want to work for this wishy-washy fucker anyway.  since then i've applied to more walgreens around the city.  haven't heard anything yet.  i was in the process of applying to unmh because they have a tech I position open.  i couldn't complete the application because i needed 3 professional references, and i only have 1 that is definate.  it's aggravating, but i'm still chugging along.  i'm planning on appyling to this new greatland target that is opening up next month, and the target near the house also has a pharmacy that i'll apply to as well.  i'm at the point, though, where any job is better than nothing at all.  i'll just have to see what happens... 

ok girlfriend situation.  it's become better.  two weeks ago i was seriously considering a break up.  i had become miserable having to spend every day and night with brandi.  she is an awesome person, don't get me wrong.  funny, sweet, romantic...but having to ""nurse"" her required me to spend my days and nights over at her place.  i seriously felt like i was married or in a serious committed relationship, something that i've come to find i do not want at this point in my life.  i don't want to be the lesbian with a uhaul!  we have moved way too fast.  way too fast man!  the funny thing is that i really had no choice but to allow our relationship move at the speed of light, mainly because brandi had become incapacitated.  i was really the only one who was around to take care of her.  her physical situation has become better, so i haven't had to spend my nights with her until last night.  last night she had to spend the night at my house because we thought her suv was burning oil, and the possibility of the car overheating on her way home in the middle of the night wasn't good.  so she ended up spending the night.  i was really annoyed.  it was my night off from work, and quite frankly i wanted to spend it by myself doing my own thing.  i had spent my entire afternoon with her, and i was really looking forward to being able to play my guitar and playing with my puppies.  now i'm having thoughts of breaking up again.  i just need my space.  this morning before we headed over to walmart to grab a quart of oil (which i paid for) for the car (which, by the way, was perfectly fine and seemed operating like normal...), i told her that i wanted to stay home today and chill.  i work tonight again, and i want time to myself....

also, it seems like the little things are getting to me as well.  nowadays all that brandi and i ever talk about are the happenings on our internet games.  i want to have a girlfriend who can talk about what happened at school or at work, or what her and her friend talked about over lunch.  it's getting to me that all she ever has to tell me is what her and her internet friends chatted about that particular day.  it sucks that i'm her only outlet for a social life.  i think i'm becoming bored :\

something happened that shook me a little a few days ago.  brandi and i were walking through another walmart looking for air fresheners for her car.  we are very open about our relationship, so of course we were holding hands while walking.  as we were walking my favorite teacher from highschool (coach tybor) walked up the same aisle.  i started to freak out a little on the inside.  all i could think at that moment was that i'm holding my girlfriend's hand and that i should let go because i don't know how to deal with the fact that someone i know on a personal level now knows that i'm gay.  i didn't let go.  instead i looked down and ignored him walking past us.  it bothered me a little.  i wish i could deal with being out a little better.  i know he wouldn't have cared, but i'm so afraid of people i know being judgemental.  it's tough.          

anyway, i think i will be meeting with my new friend heather fairly soon.  we've been trying to meet for a while now, but our schedules kinda clash so it's been difficult.  i'm looking forward to meeting her.  i'm always up for making new friends.

i've been itching to get another tattoo.  i think i'm going to go with carla when she get's hers.  i know exactly what i want and where i want it :)  i just need to figure out how i'm going to pay for it lol.

i'm going to start my diet and exercise routine today again.  i've been running a couple of days a week, usually 2-2.5 miles everytime.  i haven't exactly been sticking to my diet, and i feel gross about it lol.  so the plan for today is to do my interval workout.  i really want to get back into exercising like i used to.  i haven't felt like myself nowadays.  

i'm going to play guitar and listen to the corrs.  that will surely put me in a better mood to finish up my lab homework for tomorrow.

i have this total crush on jodie foster.  i wish she would just come out already :p"

"event","not a bad day today.  just had class.  brandi picked me up this morning from work.  it was good seeing her.  we both kinda had a stressful evening yesterday.  i spent most of my day with her, and i'm spending the night at her place tonight.  

tonight while walking through the mall, lionel called me back.  i was offered the position in the pharmacy.  hell yeah i took it!  i start tomorrow.  i need to call tomorrow around 10 to let this other guy (i think lionel said his name is mr. whitehouse) know that i am coming in at 1 in the afternoon to start the second step in the training process.  

now the hard part.  i need to let linda know that i cannot work the evenings for her anymore because of this new job.  i am still willing to come over late, spend the night, and be there in the mornings when joe wakes up.  she doesn't have a replacement.  i'll have to let her know about all this tomorrow if i have time.  i need to head home in the morning early and go with the madre to the mall.  walgreens has a dress code, and i don't have a single piece of ""dressy"" clothing.  i need to ask tomorrow when i call what exactly the dress code is."

"event","flo is here screwing up everything once again.  sucks.  i've been cramping since late yesterday afternoon and it hasn't let up yet.  not cool yo.

yesterday i picked up brandi and we got breakfast.  actually i just ate breakfast lol.  i was so hungry after my run man.  i got this awesome banana/strawberry french toast.  it was yummy.  afterwards we stopped at this car show near the hooters.  heh brandi has this thing for old american muscle, so we stopped and had a look around.  then we headed over to the flea market.  i was more fruitful this time around, buying 3 pairs of earrings and a sweet pair of sunglasses within 20 minutes of getting there.  i also bought this grey adidas shirt, though i hadn't realized the fading on it from the sun before i gave the lady my $4.  i put it on later at the apt and there on the front is a lovely square area that is sun bleached a little.  i guess it was folded and allowed to put in the sun just a tad too long :p  so that part of the shirt is lighter than the rest of the shirt.  the bottom of the bleached square, where you can really tell it's faded, falls underneath my boobs so you can't see it unless i pull the shirt down lol.  it's not terrible, but i won't wear it ever again because i will be bothered just by knowing that i'm wearing a multicolored grey shirt :p  

so after the flea we went to walmart and bought two board games, clue and monopoly.  we played those and had lunch at the apt.  then we went and shot some pool, came home for a while, and left again to go eat dinner at garcias.  yum mexican food!  by then i was cramping really bad so when we got back to the apt i took a little nap and then came home. 

in the midst of all this excitement i got a call from one of the walgreens i applied to.  i have an interview tues at 2:30!!!  the pharmacist said that he has two m-f shifts open, one from 10-6 and the other 1-9.  he did say that they are somewhat flexible with the scheduling, which is good because i don't have a perfect class/nannying schedule myself.  gawd i really hope things work out.  i would love to get this job!

he said to bring a resume if i had one.  i guess i can write one up, don't really have anything to put on it other than my school work/honor societies.  i don't really have any other work experience other than that 4 month seasonal stint at target.  i guess it's better than nothing at all i suppose.

brandi wants me to come over today.  all i feel like doing is laying around in bed until work lol.  at least i think i work today."

<hr>
i work tonight!!!!!!!!  linda got the ok to go back to work.  yay now i won't have to get a job at the frontier lol.  the only bummer is that i won't be able to pick up brandi from her class tonight.  i was looking forward to that.  we were also going to try to hit karaoke tonight again, but that's gonna have to wait until next week.

i am looking forward to working though.  carla and i have a lot to catch up on lol.  i'm thinking i'm going to come out officially to her tonight and tell her that i have a girlfriend.  i'm sure she already knows anyway.  i practically scream gay lol.  hehe go me! 

had to drop off the kia this morning at the shop.  it needs a new muffler.  hehehe i call it my ghetto dyke car.  lol it rules...

that's pretty much it.  i think i need to go workout.  i haven't done shite in over a week!  then i need to eat.  i'm so effing hungry.

i want funky lolz!!! :(

edit:  too tired to workout.  fuck it i'll do something tomorrow.    i just want to sleep man."

"event","time for a decent update.  let's see.  well last friday night brandi and i went to exhale.  it was ok.  we spent most of our time playing pool and air hockey lol.  the dj sucked ass.  the next time we go out to dance we will go to the pulse.  

saturday i picked up brandi and her cousin cody and his friend brian in the morning, and we all headed to the flea market.  i had intended on getting earrings and another pair of sunglasses, but instead i ended up getting a sweet von dutch t-shirt (it's blue!) and a pink bandana.  after dropping cody off at work and brian back home, brandi and i went to louie's pub for lunch.  we shared a nachos grande and i had a guinness  yum! :)  afterwards i spent the rest of the day over at brandi's place and watched more of the l word.  andrea called me late in the afternoon and wanted to know if i wanted to go to a party for some girl that she knows.  i had told her that we would go out sometime that weekend, but i didn't really feel like going to a party.  i asked if brandi could come too, but that kinda complicated things.  i was going to say no to the party, but then i felt bad because i did say that we would do something together.  so i called andrea back and we figured out a time that she wanted to be picked up.  i picked her up around 8:30 that night.  this party that was thrown was for a girl, andy, who she had met and hit it off with about 2 years ago.  it was a going away party for her because she is leaving to go to louisiana this thursday.  anyway, emily was the girl who was throwing the party, and it was at her apt.  i had no idea who these people were.  when we first got to the complex we didn't know what apt was emily's and andy wasn't picking up her phone.  we stood around in the parking lot for a good 15 minutes.  finally andy picked up her phone and told us which building emily's apt was in, etc etc.  we found it finally and walked in.  before i go any further, i just have to say that i never want to experience what i did at that moment ever again.  we walked in and a handful of people just stared at us lol.  only andrea knew emily, but they had met 2 years ago as well and they didn't know each other very well anyway.  it was so awkward!  i felt totally out of place man!  a sporty looking dyke in a room full of weirdo goths.  omg just looking at them made me want to get out of there haha!  no one was very welcoming.  i certainly didn't want to go up to anyone and introduce myself for fear of someone putting a spell on me or some shit and taking advantage of me hahaha!  only two guys talked to us and were somewhat civil.  it was just weird.  and andy wasn't even there yet!  a party thrown for her and she wasn't even around!  i made andrea a drink and we just sat at the table and talked amongst ourselves.  we sat around for another 15-20 minutes and i had finally had enough.  we walked back out and sat around the front of the apt for a while.  we decided to wait around for andy to show up.  andrea really wanted to see her so i figured it was cool to wait around for a while.  she didn't show up.  andrea called her cell and left a message saying that we didn't know anyone, that we felt totally unwelcomed, and that we left lol.  we headed over to borders before i dropped andrea off back at home.  we talked for a while there until the store closed.  i dropped her off and finally headed home myself.  i was effing exhausted from that long ass day.

sunday i spent the whole day over at brandi's.  i don't remember much that happened, but all i know is that my feet hurt from the sunburn lol.  oh yeah and i didn't work that night and we went to the frontier for dinner.  

yesterday i had class.  linda called me after my lecture to inform me that she will probably have to go on medical leave for up to a year!!  ugh!!  she has a mrsa (methicillin resistant staph. aureus) infection from her spider bite.  actually she probably got the infection from the hospital.  basically it's a resistant bacterium that takes up to a year of drug therapy for the infection to clear up.  so now i'm basically jobless.  the only good news yesterday was that i received my cpht certificate in the mail.  i just applied to a handful of other walgreens just now and included my certification number and all that.  hopefully i will hear something from someone soon.  i need money pronto!!"

how exciting!  too bad there is yet to be an american release date though :p  and a double bummer for all those old songs on the new album too.  there's only a limited number of times one can listen to ""old town"" and ""httw"".  it's still pretty exciting though.  finally a more traditional album!  that makes me smile :)"

"event","my eyes hurt so bad today.  i had to guide myself with my hands this morning to the loo to pee because i couldn't open my eyes for the life of me.  it's what happens when i leave my contacts in for 16 hours lol.  i'm stuck with wearing the glasses today because i'm terribly afraid of putting anything in my eyes.

last night i took brandi to exhale.  we both wanted to see how the karaoke night was.  she had been dying to sing karaoke for a while now but hadn't had the chance to since leaving phoenix.  two of the girls i met that one thursday of the pool tourney were there.  i said hi to selena.  she's feckin hilarious.  i didn't get the chance to get her number so that we could hang out because after andi sang her third song we just had to leave.  it was late and i couldn't see anything out of my left eye lol!  andi sang ""why don't you & i"" by santana w/ alex band, westlife's ""swear it again"", and edwin mccain's ""i'll be"".  she was really good...got a lot of applause from everybody and everything.  very cool.  i had a fun time just watching everybody do their thing.  you wouldn't catch me on stage singing that's for sure!   

my new friend andrea arrives in town today.  she's moving here from new york and is going to be staying with a family friend.  we are going to try to get together this weekend.  that should be fun! :)

the madre and the bro just left to pick up the kia.  i just have a few words about that: ""it's about fucking time"".

i do need to find a second job soon, though, to help pay for the increased car insurance as well as other expences now.  this weekend i'm going to visit a couple walgreens stores and talk to the managers about pharmacy technician positions.  i'm also going to apply for a tech job at the hospital soon.  things are looking up! :)

my period is late this month.  i hate this shite man!  who knows how long i'll be in pms mode for.  watch out for my mood swings peeps!

i need to hit the laundromat today.  our dryer still isn't fixed.  can't afford to get it fixed and we certainly cannot afford to buy a new one.  i usually wash clothes at work, but since that didn't happen i have to spend a few hours at the laundromat today.  

once i get enough money i will be purchasing all of the absolutely fabulous seasons on dvd.  i've been dying to watch them forever now.

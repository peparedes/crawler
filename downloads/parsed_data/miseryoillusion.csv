Life is about as much of a roller coaster as ever.
Just a little more extreme.
It seems to be going a lot faster.
The climbs are twice as high.
The plummets graze against the ground.
Upside down.
Leaving some hair on the pavement.

This whole week has been up and down.
I don't even know where I stand anymore.
I've been toyed with because someone was lonely.
It feels like they shattered everything in my chest and is all lays in rubble at the bottom of my stomach.
I've also been lied to, betrayed, and then forgotten about by someone I once called a best friend.
I'm in dire need of a change in who I accompany myself with.
I miss all those I haven't seen in forever.
If you happen to be one of those people and are reading thing, let's make plans.

On the good side though.
I've come to realize that my heart hasn't turned to stone.
This was the first time I've actually had legit feelings for someone in a long time.
Even though it's probably stone at this point.

My friend Brandy's roommates are moving out within the next month.
She wants me to take the extra space.
She's even lining up a job for me out there.
So perhaps I'll be in San Antonio in a couple months?

I don't know if there's much more to talk about.

O yeah...I don't know if you will see this, but I feel like I hate you.
Hate isn't a word that I just toss around when talking about someone.
But.
I hate you.
FUCKING HATE YOU

Warning to the next person to cross me the wrong way.
I'm not going to play nice and let things go.
I'll take karma into my own hands if I have to and stab you in the fucking face."

"event","I received a CD in the mail from F11 Photog last week or so and I just received on from Kelly today.  Both have pictures from my Satyr shoot a couple weeks ago.  That's around 55 pictures or so all together between the two of them.  Since there is so many of them, I'm only going to upload  a few of my favorites from each photographer.  If you want to see them all, they are all on my myspace.  If you don't have my myspace, ask for a link and I'll send you one.  You'll have to add me as a friend to view them though.

"event","So it's looks as thought there's a chance I'll be moving out of state.  Can't really say for certain, and I don't have my hopes up or anything.  What reason should I have to have high hopes?  It was supposed to happen many times before, but plans always fell through.  Either way, there's talk about me going out to Vegas for a visit to see the wonderous KT.  Figure I'd look around at job opportunities out there.  My friend Tomanisa is also going to be looking for a place out there for me to stay and talk her friend into getting me a job where she works.  It all sounds good, but again, not getting my hopes up on the matter what so ever.  Even though it would please me to no end to get out of this God forsaken cesspool of a fucking state.  I don't really have any reason to stay, more or less just excuses, and excuses are just that.  Excuses.  After last weekend's bull shit, I want out of here more than ever.  Fuck this place and the people in it that I don't care about.  Even then.  Fuck a handful of the people I care about.  Fucking lying ass tools.  I hope it burns when you fucking piss, bitchrags."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Satyr-day"">This past Sunday (Yes, I know they lj-cut says Satyr-day...but it wasn't a Saturday.  I just wanted to use it so deal =P)I had a photo shoot out in Howell with a photographer that I had been talking to online for a few months now.  Her name is Kelly and we've been throwing ideas back and forth between each other.  She had been playing a huge shoot with a bunch of models that involved fairies and elves and the such.  So that's how this came along.  I didn't really want to go along with all the other models and be an elf or fairy or anything so I went with being a satyr.  Kelly made me a pair of furry pants to wear, and dug out a pair of horns to latex for my forehead.  She also went out and bought all sorts of body paint for all the models.

So, the night before, on Sunday my dumb ass didn't sleep because I got sucked into the computer and conversations.  That and I was really excited for my shoot.  I ended up take what few dollars Tabby gave to me and bought myself a few energy drinks to make it through the day.  Kelly's fiance, Scott, picked me up and we headed out to Camp Talahi out in Howell.  At least I think that's the name of it.  Anyways.  I met the other models, Sarah, Sarah,Christine, and I can't remember the guys name or the other girls name right now.  Blame exhaustion.  Kelly gave me the furry pants, latexed the horned to my head, and then sprayed down my body.  I thought it looked amazing.  So did everyone else.  Then Sarah number one and I walked out to the field where everyone else was, and to my surprise, there were 4 other photographers.  I ended up shooting with everyone and getting some amazing pictures done.  We shot from about 10am until 4/5pm before I came home, showered, and got ready for DEMF.  Woo-hoo for lack of sleep.

Well, I got two pictures back right now.  Apparently between everyone there was well over 2,000 pictures taken.

"event","So, I'm about to be 22 next Wednesday.  
Fun stuff.
I don't know exactly what's going on for my birthday.
I know the day before on the 9th I'll be going to a concert that my friend's Rob and Ashleigh are taking me to.
Woo-hoo for Wednesday 13!! 
The day of my birthday, the 10th, I have no idea what's going on.
I know Sparkles and I are at least going to hang out since it's our birthday.
The day after, on the 11th is the Assemblage 23 concert. 
No idea what exactly is going on for that. 
I know that Justin said he'd try to get me a ticket for it.
On Friday the 12th, I was thinking of having a party, but I'm not totally sure right now.
We'll see if I'm feeling up to it when the time comes.

It still hurts a lot.
I have trouble sleeping and I can't seem to get away from myself.
The only time I feel the least bit better is when I'm talking to a friend on the phone.
Every song has become a depressing song.
Every show a soap opera.
Now I remember why I've been so afraid of relationships and love.
Every time my heart breaks is the worst time of my life.
It only makes it worse when you act like everything is all right and nothing happened.
It really makes me feel like you don't care about your actions and that I'm nothing.


Please don't think that I'm trying to make you feel bad, because I'm not.
I'm just using my journal for what it's used for.

Did you think it wouldn't hurt?
Did you think I wouldn't feel 
when the world came falling down?
or maybe you didn't think at all 
and that's why I feel what I feel now 
Did you think I wouldn't fall? 

Did you think I wouldn't cry?
Did you think I wouldn't beg 
you to stay?
One of these days you're gonna reconize 
just who you've thrown away 

Marilyn my bitterness 
I've fallen to a stranger nightmare 
Marilyn, oh Marilyn 
I cannot... break away

Marilyn my bitterness 
I've fallen to a stranger nightmare 
Marilyn, oh Marilyn 
I cannot... find my way

Things have been Hell.

I spend my days trying to figure out where I'm going to sleep next.

My family could really care less it seems.

All my mom offered to do was hold on to my blankets.

Isn't she great? -sarcasm-

I'm starting to become reacquanted with alcohol.

At least I'm not spending money on it though.

Won't do that again.

I'm about to go turn in an application here in a bit.

Pretty much...the only good things that have happened to me are...

Talking to friends that I haven't talked to in quite some time.

Arranging my first photoshoot.

It's shown a little improvement though.
Still no job, but a place to live at the end of the month.
My friend's mom is moving out and leaving the apartment to my friend Kitty.
Kitty's going to allow me to move in.
Along with her boyfriend, her brother, and one other person.
Which I hope is Ashley, she'd be the only one to keep me sane.
The first month is going to be free for me since I'm having trouble finding a job.
Which I find to be complete bull shit.
I fucking hate it so much.
It drives me to want to do things I haven't done in years/weeks, and shouldn't think about doing.
No one can job hunt this much and not get a fucking interview.
It's ricockulous.
Fuck Michigan.
I'm starting to think taking up the offer to be flown out to MD would've been the better idea.
Even if I don't have a place out there to live, there are jobs coming out the ass.
I don't know which would be worse.  
Jobless, but have a home, at least for a little bit.
Or homeless with tons of job opportunities and limited amount of friends.

"event","My Aunt Helen might be losing her job.
If she loses her job, we lose this place because we wouldn't be able to afford it.
I guess a friend of hers in Arkansas offered her to move down there.
She can bring anyone she wants including the cats.
She said that her, my cousin Danny, and I would all be moving down there.
Thing is...I'm totally cool with that.
This guy lives in BFE middle of nowhere but he has 20 acres of land and huge house.
There's no water bill either because it's all well water.
Town supposedly isn't too far from his place and they're always looking for help.
So maybe if this does happen it'd be easy to find a job.
That and it puts me one step closer to one place I decided that I'd like to move.
Only issue would be that Arkansas is a boring ass place to be.
Good thing I sit on the computer all the time though.
It shouldn't take too long to get from AK to TX.
Wouldn't cost as much as from here to TX."

Tears run down my face I can't replace
And now that I'm strong I have figured out
How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all

It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

And waves are crashing
And stars are falling all for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you I'll be the one

Pull my strings just for a thrill

As all of you, or most of you atleast, realize, I've made it a point in my life not to be like that.
I act like a gentleman, I nice, respectful, caring, etc.  
It's become who I am.
There was a time I fucked up, and I still hate myself for it.
I bleed for days over it.
I've sworn not to be the ""typical male"".
Well...I'm starting to realize that calling it the ""typical male"" is rather sexist.
I've started to see that more women are ""typical males"" than most males are.
Most girls that I've dealt with recently have lied, cheated, ignored, been rude, yadda yadda.
My emotions have been toyed with, heart has been broken, plans have been ruined.
I'm sick of being treated like this.
I don't deserve it, I know I don't.
It's bull shit like this that leads to my drinking.
I've become dependant on alcohol again.
I can't sleep without it.
And I don't beleive I feel good without it.
I know it's all mental.
But doesn't make it any less real to me."

"event","So...I'm going to start this from 10/10 12:00am
I was sitting on the computer once the day turned to Tuesday the 10th.
I was talking to a few people, getting birthday wishes and such.
Around 12:30am, my cousin Dan (whom I live with) brought out a bottle of vodka and said ""Let me be the first one to give you a drink"". 
So we mixed vodka with lemonade and I was drinking that.
I got drunk after a few, and ended up calling Mary, who was having her own fun with Char and a lil something that has three letters, each the same letter. ^__^
(Gawd, I miss those)
Anyways...I don't exactly remember everything...I remember hearing Char in the background and her saying something like she's not weird or anything without drugs and I said ""I'll beleive it when I see it.""
I mainly talked to Mary online after we got off the phone. 
Which is always great because Mary is just that, great. <3
I ended up going to bed around 5am or so and waking up at around 9am.
Sat online, got more birthday wishes, then around 3pm, I tried to get some sleep because I had a big night ahead of me and I was really tired.
Chris called like, right when I was about to fall asleep, he wished me a happy birthday and such, then he let me go so I could sleep.  Not a minute after I hang up the phone, my mom calls me and wishes me a happy birthday and her and I talk for a while.
After I got off the phone with her I called Chris back because I was awake now and he wanted me to.
I'm going to leave the convo between him and I hush hush.
After I got the phone with him, I called Dean and talked to him for a while.
After that...sat online, watched a bunch of anime.  Mainly Disgaea.
Dean, Rob, and Jared came out here later around 7-8 or something.
Dean, Rob, Jared, Danny and I all headed out to Sarah's parent's place, but stopped at 7-11 on the way to get some Sparks which Danny bought.
I got a free Slurpee ^___^
It was banana.
Yuuuuummmmm
Well, we headed out to Sarah's, her and Antwoine were there.
I called Jeni to give her directions, Rob called his gf Ashley and I gave her directions also.
Jeni and Robby showed up, picked me up and we went to Frank's to get stuff and to pick him up.
We went to the liquor store where I bought vodka, Mickey's and a 2 liter of faygo.
First time buying alcohol. ^_^
I stood there, getting my ID checked and stuff...it was kinda confusing for them because it's vertical because it's not a driver's license.
But the manager guy gave me a Zebra Cake for free! ^_^
I talked to the lady cashier for a bit, she was telling me about this bar in Livonia that opens up on the 27th.
Sounds like a cool place, I'll have to head out there.
We then went back to Jeni's, then to McDonalds, then to the gas station, then back to Sarah's.
Chewy, Sam, and Lisa were there and Rob's gf Ashley showed up aswell.
We drank more, smoked, drank, smoked, yadda yadda yadda.
Antwoine went missing, which is retarded.
Didn't even tell anyone he was leaving.
Assface.
Chewy, Sam, and Lisa left.
Josh showed up with red wine.
ewwwwww
He left and brought back SoCo and Coke w/Lime.
Best drink ever.
We played some poker/hold em
Jeni, Frank and Robby left.
Vince showed up with more stuff and his sledge hammer.
Drank more, smoked more, drank more, smoked more, drank more, smoked more, drank, drank drank...yadda yadda yadda.
Played Egyptian Ratscrew.
Vince and Josh left.
The rest of us started making drunk phone calls at 4:30 in the morning. XD
I called Mary, woke her up, I felt bad. -.-
Called umm...Leah...my cousin Jeni, Missy, what I thought was Amber(which turned out to be her old dorm.  Sorry freshman).
Left them all voice mails.
Called Dan, who answered, talked to him for a bit...don't remember what was said though...
Called Jeni...got confused because her and my cousin Jeni both have very similar voice mails.
I think that's it....I'm not sure, and probably not.
Rob, Dean and Jared left.
I went and passed out.
Woke up, and came back home.
Sorry it's not all detailed and stuff...probably forgot a few things...but I was fucked up.
There were people I wish had come.
Rachelle, Stevo, a bunch of people outta state, a bunch of others in state.
But it was great fun none the less.
Thanks to all who made my birthday possible.
It was the best birthday ever. ^_^"

Fucking bull shit.
I hate it. 
To equal out going to the SG show, my aunt wants to kick me out.
I've been trying to find a job.
I keep my share of the chores done like agreed.
I don't even eat that much here.
Why the fucking hell do I get put through this bull shit?
I swear..the next person to tell me that I did this to myself WILL GET THE SHIT BEAT OUT OF THEM!
I don't give a fuck who you are either.  
You can be 7ft tall and lift semi-trucks for a living.
I'll fucking stab you in the throat if I have to.
John offered me money.
But only money to move out to Maryland.
After that, I'd be on my own.
Which sucks a lot because I don't have a place to live out there, or a job.
Though, it's probably easier there than it is here.
I swear...this is like the 5th time I've filled out an app for Sunglass Hut and Lane whatever the fuck it is.  Both at the mall.  They keep saying they're hiring, so why the fuck won't they hire me?
I hate prebirthday crisis.  
I don't care how much I stopped drinking.
Tuesday, I'm fucking plastered."

"event","So, I just got back from the Suicide Girls show at The Majestic Theatre.
Let me tell you, that show was better than any concert I have ever been to and will probably ever go to.  I am covered in all sorts of things.  Beer, water, red bull, jack daniels, coke, silly string, and even ketchup.  I hate ketchup, but it was well worth it.  The opening bands were awesome.  The first one Tsu Shi Ma Mi Rae, were 3 girls straight from Japan!  What better way to open up the show than that?  They were great.  The bassist almost kicked Jay (a guy we met when we got there), Stevo, and I in the face a bunch of times.  The next band was Lennon, Lennon also being a Suicide Girl herself.  Then the girls came.  OMG....I LOVE REAGAN.  Stevo and I were practically dieing each time she came out.  Deffinately our favorite Suicide Girl.  I think we own the Reagan fan club.  LUCKY ASS STEVO!  Reagan spit a mouthful of Jack in his mouth.  But, we got pics with her, autographs, and all that jazz.  Nixon was great.  I loved her first set the most...that or the one where she 'killed' everyone lol.  Xiolita is gorgeous...and she's wonderful with a hula-hoop.  She even had one that blinked.  Razzi...omg....colourful...>.< I'm sorry...I can't even type out a full description of the show like I said I would.  You just had to be there to witness the greatness.  O...I will mention though...my sister, Stevo, and I were the first ones there.  I was the first one in...and we were front center stage.  There were no barracades keeping us away from the stage either.   ^_^

Seen Chris a bunch too lately.  Still no job thought.  That sucks a lot.  I still have no idea what I'm going to do with myself.  No idea what my future plans are anymore.  I originally wanted to move out to Maryland of course, but now there are so many other things that come into play.  Like Mary.  Doctors still can't figure out what's wrong with her.  She's tested both negative and positive for Chrons.  They sent her to a female doctor just incase it was something to do with her female parts.  I know that I'd want to be there for her if it's something really serious.  Ryan and his mom are moving to Tennessee next year and Ryan's mom asked me to go with them.  I keep finding more reasons to stay here but still have all the same reasons plus more to move away.  I just want to box up all my friends and move away.  Fuck Michigan.  Lame ass state.  In other news...well...there isn't really too much other news...my birthday is in a month and 2 days.  Who wants to hang out for my birthday??"

"event","So last night was alright.  My original plans to go over to Lindsay's got ruined because she didn't get a hold of me and she lost her cell.  Not gonna lie, was gonna go over there because I had a crush on her she had one on me, yadda yadda bullshit stuff.  Found out that we can't hang out, because she's pregnant and is with the baby's father.  Meh, whatever I guess.  Instead, Jessica came and picked me up.  We went to her house, met her cousin Jordan and her friend Ti I think it was.  Hung out at her house til Randy got there, then we just drove around a lot.  First Ann Arbor, then I think we managed out to Ypsi.  Then we came back out to Westland, went to Rally's, got fries, then to Dunkin Donuts, then I got dropped off.  It was fun.  Not complaining at all.  Got high.  tsk tsk bad Aubrey.  XP  Fuck that.  I ain't gonna quit right now.  Too much going on for me to handle the stress.  Besides, it'll probably be the last time for quite a while. 

Today.  Nothing planned.  I have to find somewhere to go tonight and all day tomorrow.  I can't be here for the inspection on my cousin's apartment or he fails the inspection and loses the apartment.  Which in turn, I lose my place to stay."

"event","Hmm...I think I'm gonna go back to how I looked and stuff years ago before I started going to City and while I was still in school.  Back to the same music style too.  I'm not going to totally ditch all the music I listen to now.  I just let the whole 'goth' thing take too much of a hold on me.  I miss listening to Korn, Adema, Mudvayne, Slipknot...all that, religiously.  And I'm kind of sick of all the chick clothes and shit.  I want my baggy stuff back.  I want my band shirts too.  Though I'll probably be in a lot more beaters because it's summer.  Oi...I need black hair dye. >.o  Fuck this red shit."

"event","You've been acting weird as fook lately.
I have no idea what the hell is going on.
Or what I did to make you pissed.
It's not fair to me that you don't tell me.
Even if it's the last thing you tell me, I want to know why.

Anyways.
A friend of mine wants me to make a promise that I can't make.
That whole situation can break me, or break any chance of me moving to MD.
I don't know what to do.  v.v

The Cure finally fully injected itself into my brain.
Been listening to The Cure a lot now.

Had a couple messed up dreams the other night.
One about MariLee as a vampire chasing me around.
Sorry for electrocuting you hun. LoL ^^;;
The other I'll type out, but I'm not mentioning names.
I was in the kitchen grabbing utensils and ingredients to make a cake.  I call out a name and a little kid, anywhere from 3-5 years of age comes running in.  He had long dark hair.  He called me daddy...o.O...anyways...we started making a cake for ""Mommy's"" birthday...having fun with it...playing around...he was sneaking frosting from the cake, so I took my fingertip , dipped it in the frosting and put it on his nose, he had the cutest confused look cross eyed trying to look at his nose, it was adorable, then ""Mommy"" walked into the house and he ran out of the kitchen and tried to distract her from coming into the kitchen, she picked him up and walked in and yeah..we lit candles and had cake...
That dream made me want to have a son even more than I do now...-.-
It also made me like ""Mom"" more than I do now.
No, it wasn't Emily, so don't even think that's why I refused to give out names.
If it was her, I would've told the name of the son.
But if I gave out the son's name, the mom could be figured out.
Not that anyone on here would know who I'm talking about except for one person, and I'll probably tell her later...>.>

Last night I met and hung out with this girl Lynn from Inkster.  We sat in her basement, smoked, and watched most of Hoffa before she had to get to sleep for work today.  It was fun.  She likes MSI more than I do, and that's not too easy of a task since MSI is one of my like...5 favorite bands.  Korn, MSI, HIM, TBM, and now The Cure.  It's funny..she's hung out with Jimmy Urine a bunch of times and makes it her purpose those nights to annoy him as much as humanly possible, and suceeds.  Haha...I figured it'd be hard to annoy him.  Guess not?

Bah..I wish the weather would make up it's mind.  Looks like hell out there.  

I still need a job. 
I'm still looking for one.
Dammit....this sucks. v.v"

"event","I really need to quit cheating on quitting smoking.

I can't help it though.  Cigarettes calm me down.

But that's pretty fucking obvious because they calm down the mood that not smoking them puts me in. 

That mood involves a lot of the word FUCK.

I totally remember why I didn't listen to Adema all the time.  

They make me think and relate too much.  

But I still love 'em, so I'm going to continue listening to them.

Just after I get over the nic-fit.

Because Adema and anger don't really do too good together. XD

Tomorrow I'm supposed to go to City Club with Josh and Rachelle.  

You should go.

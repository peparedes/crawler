""Valentine""

it's words you forget to anniversary songs
the bottles bite back
your tolerance wrong
your good intentions count for little anymore
if you're sorry why wage war?
i'm not fully convinced that there's something wrong with this
could anotehr point of view, baised and untrue, tear me away from you?
will you be my valentine if i'm a world away?
apologies are breaking me
the constants aren't so constant anymore
for two days i wait for calls to come through
tonight for me translates to yesterday to you
you bend and you wave when you're barely away
i wish i could say tonight that when you bend 
and wave goodbye you'd take me with you


""Overdue""

You're a few years overdue.
I spent them waiting here for you.
Now your charity's refused,
I can name a penance for abuse.

Twenty four years overdue,
what kind of role model are you?
Very least learn not to do,
I think I might be over you.

Do hope I won't 
Learn to make 
The same mistakes, 
That you would 
Make me aware 
That only fear, 
My only hope, 
Is letting go.

Went on a limb for you,
Capsized when I turned twenty two.
Did it burn as bad for you?
No bottle serves to soothe my wounds.

Do hope I won't 
Learn to make 
The same mistakes, 
That you would 
Make me aware 
That only fear, 
My only hope, 
Is letting go. 
My only hope 
Is letting go.

You're a few years overdue.
I spent them waiting here for you.

""My Friend Peter""

I dont care who you've been sleeping with these days
You're outta my hair
It's growing just above my smiling face that I wear
Every night I drink myself to sleep
Not thinking about you
Not thinking about anything at all

I don't care who you've been dining with these days
It's more than fair
Much rather be drinking anyways
With my friend Peter
Who lives so fucking far away
Yet not as far as you
Even though you live right down my fucking street

And I'm tired of sleeping with myself
I'm tired, all these drinks and drugs no longer help
I'm tired of lying about not thinking of you
Maybe my friend Peter can tell me what to do

I dont care who you've been kissing on these days
It's out of my hands
and in my mouth with such a pleasant taste
I need a beer to wash it all away without a trace
And then i'll drink 23 more
To wipe this stupid smile off my fucking face

I'm tired of sleeping with myself
I'm tired, all those drinks and drugs no longer help
I'm tired of lying about not thinking of you
Maybe my friend Peter can tell me what to do"

"event","i went to the doctor friday. the doctor was nice. the med's i just started taking made my tummy hurt last night. than today i just felt weird, tingly, and dizzy. <s>i <3 jimi</s> im bored..

you dont know who i am

Echo

There's something about the look in your eyes
Something I noticed when the light was just right
It reminded me twice that I was alive
And it reminded me that you're so worth the fight
My biggest fear will be the rescue of me
Strange how it turns out that way
Could you show me dear...something I've not seen?
Something infinitely interesting
There's something about the way you move
I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing
More subtle than something, someone contrives
Your movements echo that I have seen the real thing
Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you
Strange how it turns out that way
Could you show me dear...something I've not seen?
Something infinitely interesting


Mexico

You could see me reaching
So why couldn't you have met me half way?
You could see me bleeding
And you would not put pressure on the wound
You only think about yourself...you only think about yourself
You better bend before I go
On the next train to Mexico
You could see my breathing
But you still kept your hand over my mouth
You could feel me seething
But you just turned your nose up in the air
You only think about yourself...you only think about yourself
You better bend before I go
On the next train to Mexico

11 AM

Seven a.m.
The garbage truck beaps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away
Could I push rewind?
The credits traverse, signifying the end
But I missed the best part
Could we please go back to start?
Forgive my indecision
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, a day will come when I want off that ride
Eleven a.m.
By now you would think that I would be up
But my bedsheets shade the heat of choices I've made
And what did I find?
I never thought I could want someone so much
Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in that old fear
Forgive my indecision
I am only a man
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, a day will come when I want off that ride
Twelve p.m. and my dusty telephone rings
Heavy head up from my pillow, who could it be?
I hope it's you"

"event","yesterday morning at 7:10 i woke up like 1/2 way when ur not really awake. than all of a sudden the whole freakin island of oahu started shaking for like 45 seconds! my kittie ran to me. a few seconds after it stopped there was a lil aftershock. i was waiting for it to really start shakeing and that would be the last anyone had heard from the girl that went to live in hawaii for a bit. i heard the power go off right after. yes i HEARD it. zzoooppp. like when a robot shuts down..silly. james went to work. im use to being in mass and figured the electricity wouldnt be out for more than a few hours so i told him to take the car. after waking up all sweaty a few times to check if the power is on yet, i finally decide i cant sleep through the power being out anymore. i get up and dont know what the hell im going to do with myself. i trying calling shelly to tell her im alive. my fucking cell phone wont work...at all. after playing with the fuse box to make sure im not just a stupid girl that cant figure out how to turn the power on i went for a walk outside. two boys stopped me and said their power was out and their cell's werent working.<b> it was like the world had ended outside</b>, or as close as ive ever seen it. all the stores were closed or blocked off. all the traffic lights n crosswalk signals were out..hence the no power on the island. james comes home and saves me at like 4pm. there was no power in waikiki at all. sucks for all the people on vacation. no planes were departing from the island. when james got home we were almost out of gas and figured we had just enough to get where the power had just turned back on in pearlridge/aiea. the lines to get gas were all the way down the road. we only sat there for like 20 mins waiting. we needed food! all the fast food places had lines from the drive thru to like a mile down the road. it was crazy! damn people come on now its only been 10 hours without fast food! james and i went to walmart..it was fucking crazy..well walmarts always crazy but i mean it was like a mosh pit without the music. shitty. i grabbed some cheetos and we got the fuck out of there! ;D all i heard all morning was sirens...i didnt give a shit at the time though..i was trying to sleep without a/c. james and i got back on the highway..going ""lights!!"" ...""no lights"" hopeing that we wouldnt have to amuse ourselves by candle light. well i would amuse myself and he would go to sleep. stupid boy. we get off our exit as i scream ""no lights!!"". i lite the candles when we got home...james tryed to go to sleep. about an hour later i hear what sounds like a bunch of hoodlems screaming. i thought about how imature the stupid kids were for being so loud when it was late and after everything that had happened. than we got power back is was around like 8:30. than i realized im a bitch b/c the people were just yelling cuz they got power back..duh lyndz. the apartments across the street were out for about an hour or so more. haha! ;X the whole day i was thinking fuck..something worth telling everyone about and i cant fucking call anyone. i didnt know what the hell had happened until james came and we listened to the radio the whole way. his store didnt even open he sat outside from 9-3:30 with everyone seeing if the power was going to come on. i didnt have to work yesterday..or today so i wasnt even thinking about champs sports. 6.6 magnatidue earthquake off the coast of the big island (hilo). now i've experienced an earthquake, kick ass! <a href=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15294020/>

""I'll Let You Live""

The first degree was a riot
You were making sure
My lesson's learned
I'm not ashamed but I'm trying
I've come to expect the standards you have set...
Tell me just how dangerous is second best
You've settled for less and I'm sure you'll settle again

There's no stopping me
I'm gutting you out (Does this make you feel safe)
There's no stopping this...
The closer I look is just the further that you get
Already stubborn skin thickens
In a valiant attempt to understand
So understand.
There's no stopping me
I'm gutting you out (Does this make you feel safe)
There's no stopping this
I'm gutting you out (Does this make you feel safe)
I got tired (got tired) of waiting When(of waiting)
When the guilt subsides the night begins...
I know it's not what you deserve.
The night begins.
Came as a gift from a good friend
That dissaproves
But understands
That you represent
And actively encourage
All of my worst habbits
They all are proof
That we're both capable of the most terrible things
""Don't test me""
There's no stopping this
I'm gutting you out (Does this make you feel safe)
There's no stopping this...
I'm gutting you out(does this make you feel safe)
i got tired(got tired).. Of waiting When..(of waiting)
the guilt subsides go up against
I know its not what you deserve

I'm stumbling all over the place. Alfred is using his camera flash as a flash light. Fucking funny! We go the wrong end up in this big field. Turn around get to the end almost. Alfred flashes the path. James is like theres a guy other there we climb down. Book it! Stop running start flashing behind us. Alfred is like my camera is tracking something moving behind us. We see the fence to get out and all make a run for it. FUCK THAT! omg..lol i wish i still smoked weed only b/c i would have hada lighter on me..lmfao. what a reason. What kind of person stands in the pitch black and dosent say anything..omg it was scarey..lol. We got some good pics though when it wasnt dark. We went on a hike last week also. I got really dirty and slipt on my ass like 3 times. Stupid walmart water shoes with no tracktion. I jumper like 100ft of this waterfall. I only looked down for a second and just jumped.

"event","i am a clinique counter manager. ohh yeah. i get commission for everything i sell!  fuck filees up the ass. i love macys. hawaii takes out like 9% in taxes.  my job at filenes sucked so hard. i was doing all that manual labor and now i get to make people pretty, check sales daily, add a few numbers together, and have the word manager actually be in my title. no more im a LEAD at filenes. lead = you can work as hard as the manager and be a pee on. HI KRISTIN!! i had a dream about an x bf :coughjoncough: last week. i checked my voicemail of the cell i use to own that my dad has yet to cancel and he left me a voicemail. :] my time difference is like 5 hours off though so its hard for me to call anyone. i miss my kittie cats. i believe james is getting me one for xmas..but im trying not to get hopes up since we didnt get the house we were originally planing on. now we are looking at some really classy places. mmhmm...i just need to meet a nice guy to love me now..guys down here are so funny though. they holla at you but for some reason its not disrespectful its just amusing. i went swimming in the beautiful blue ocean 2 days ago. oh yeah i got some more color too. my legs arnt pastey white anymore. go me! some guy actually stopped me on the street today and goes are you from the east coast? i said yeah. and he goes boston? than says he and a group of patriots fans go bar hoppin and wanted me to go tonight. to bad im not 21. bummer. i think maybe i should change my location on n my user info so it will say the right time. well its only 12:30 here now so im gonna go for a walk..wo0t  love n miss my friends n family in mass xoxo

"event","im so much more emotionally stable now than i ever have been. from 9th grade to a few months ago i still cut myself. 9th grade i was the worst though. life is just to fucked. i went and got a mouse after work which the snake has not eaten. my parents are flipping saying i cant keep it. basterds. i do not want to give him away. >.< by tomorrow? hah! i work 3-midnight. horrible! what the hell would they like me to do bring the snake to work? my mom says its not human feeding mice to a snake. do they know what the animals they eat go through? much fucking worse. im mad but not in a bad mood. shelly n i saw eric n ryan for a bit. shelly was gonna sleep over ryans  but he was being a stupid drunken boy. and wanted me to sleep over in the guest room with eric..but um i had to come take care of the stupid mouse! not like i know the kid real well or anything but hey hes cute and jacked. who the fuck do i have? no one! drank some captain morgans. not enough though..lol i dont know what the fuck to do with the mouse if he dosent eat it...they say he might eat it dead..but i sure as hell cant kill the thing. if the snake kills it to eat it fine..but i cant. its the fucking life cycle how is it not human? and what is human these days. my mom said the snake is a murder and a killer! YES IT KILLS TO EAT! lol bleh..i have no one to give him to. ill give him away if i have to i mean its not worth pissing my parents off..but i want him ;[ ill so cry. lol omg work tomorrow is going to go by so slow! shelly n i went to the car wash! lol  my car is almost pretty. my windows are really dirty i need to wash them before work tomorrow..if i wake up...ever. got my boss a card. wasted 2 bucks on a mouse ill probably have to let go down the pond for Ringo my kittie to kill. since there is a big mole on the bottom of my steps from him. RINGO is THE KILLER! yet killing to survive is morally wrong? go figure. yuh im bored its 2 in the morning. molly ockett(kittie) is flippin out cuz the mouse is scaratching in his lil box..he can so chew out of it. grr. my dad says ""well get rid of it for you"" sounds like hes gonna do some morally wrong things to my poor snake. ;/ so mad! id rather find him a home...like my home. i told my boss id work on sunday 2-6..shelly works until 6 so if shes not doing anything ill probably be down there. AHH 2:22 in the morning now..gonna go watch tv, try to get the snake to eat, n go to sleep. night!

""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)""

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend  took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what they mean
(I'm not okay)
So be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend  took
You said you read me like a book, but the pages are all torn and frayed

I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay!
(Trust Me)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Okay)
</center>

slept over shellys most of this weekend. lots of good times. theres just still this lil voice in the back of my head. it says i need someone to hug me and tell me everything will be okay. ill probably never find someone. the chance of me meeting a guy that im gonna like that will like me is so..not gonna happen. ITS A FACT! so now its like blah..be alone and lonely forever. dream everyday that ""the one"" is somewhere here when hes probably not. whats meant to happen will happen. but than what if somehow what was meant to happen got fucked up. how the hell am i suppose to know what to do? can i fix it? is it in my power? will it happen on its own? is destiny just bull shit? so many thoughts..no answers. tomorrow i work 9-6 joy. i dont have a day off until either sunday or tuesday. nothing to do after work tomorrow..i have to return my dads paper shredder to best buy. <33"
